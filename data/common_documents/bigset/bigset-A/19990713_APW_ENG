<HEADLINE>  Khrushchev's Son Becomes US Citizen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Nikita Khrushchev's son has become a  
U.S. citizen, vowing to defend the capitalist lifestyle that his 
father long ago vowed would soon be humbled by communism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling like a newborn. It's the beginning of a new  
life,'' the 64-year-old Sergei Khrushchev said Monday after taking 
the oath of citizenship inside a Roman Catholic school auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	At his side was his wife, Valentina Golenko, who also became an  
American. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair became citizens nearly 40 years after the famous  
Kitchen Debate between former Soviet leader Khrushchev and 
then-Vice President Richard Nixon in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	``In another seven years, we will be on the same level as  
America,'' Khrushchev told Nixon then. ``When we catch you up, in 
passing you by, we will wave to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sergei Khrushchev, once a Soviet missile engineer, has lived in  
the United States since 1991, when he began teaching a class in 
Cold War history at Brown University in Providence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Khrushchevs took up a typical American existence, driving  
two American cars and living in a suburban ranch home in nearby 
Cranston. The home has central air, a Jacuzzi and an entertainment 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, they joined 242 others in becoming Americans,  
replying ``I do'' after U.S. District Judge Ronald Lagueux asked if 
they promised to be good citizens. The group then recited the 
Pledge of Allegiance; most of them, including Khrushchev, held 
miniature American flags. 
</P>
<P>
	In a June interview with The Associated Press, Khrushchev said  
he hoped his father ``would be supportive'' of his new American 
citizenship. Nikita Khrushchev died in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	``After all,'' he said, ``it's not as if I'm defecting.''  
</P>
<P>
	Still, some in Russia apparently see betrayal in Khrushchev's  
move. His son, working in Russia to gather material for his 
father's Cold War books, has reported government officials have 
hindered him since the citizenship quest was reported. 
</P>
<P>
	As he left Monday's ceremony, Khrushchev said he didn't think  
relatives in his homeland would face hostility because of his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, no!'' he replied. ``You're still living in the Cold War.  
It's a different Russia.''

<HEADLINE> Chamber Music Pianist Dies at 62 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pianist Samuel Sanders, who had a career in the  
shadows as accompanist to many of the world's best-known musicians 
and compared his job to a baseball catcher dealing with star 
pitchers, has died at age 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, a Manhattan resident, died of liver failure Friday,  
said his publicist, Lee Walter. He underwent a heart transplant, 
his second, in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders had performed with such musicians as singers Beverly  
Sills and Jessye Norman, violinists Itzhak Perlman and Pinchas 
Zukerman and cellists Yo-Yo Ma and Mstislav Rostropovich. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing with Sam was always a great pleasure and an  
adventure,'' Perlman said Monday. ``He knew what I wanted to do, I 
knew what he wanted to do. It was just like breathing together. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had the greatest sense of humor. He was a wonderful, kind  
fellow, together with his wonderful musicianship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, who took up the piano because his heart ailment kept  
him from other childhood activities, performed as a soloist with 
the New York Philharmonic when he was 16. But he was ambivalent 
about a solo career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't particularly love piano music,'' he once said. ``I  
didn't even like going to piano recitals. My teachers would drag me 
along and say, `Did you see how wonderful those thirds were?' And I 
could only think, `Let me out of here.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He took movie courses in college and considered becoming a film  
composer but found his niche when he began accompanying friends in 
recitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Using his baseball analogy, the Bronx-born Sanders said  
accompanists are like catchers because ``the catcher is in on every 
play and he really does see the whole field in a way that no other 
player sees it. ... The pitcher is the glamour figure. But if 
there's an errant pitch, the catcher has to be there. I expect the 
musical equivalent all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once, he said, a singer skipped an entire page of a Bach  
composition, and ``I went right to where she was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders strove to win recognition for the often overlooked  
accompanists, demanding that his name be included in concert 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the faculty of the Juilliard School in 1963 and  
persuaded school officials to establish a master's degree program 
for accompanists. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was absolutely right,'' said Perlman, who won two Grammy  
awards for performances with Sanders. ```Accompanist' is the wrong 
term, really. When you talk about the major repertoire written for 
the violin and piano, both instruments are totally equal. I would 
say he was my musical partner.''

<HEADLINE> British Gas Maker OKs Takeover Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Air Liquide and Air Products &AMP; Chemicals Inc. said  
today they have agreed to buy BOC Group PLC of Britain in a $11.5 
billion cash deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Liquide of France and Air Products-and-Chemicals Inc. of  
Trexlertown, Pa. said their joint offer represented ``compelling 
industrial logic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air Liquide, the world's largest industrial gases company,  
operates in 60 countries through 125 subsidiaries and employs more 
than 28,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	BOC ranks No. 2 in the world, and Air Products is fourth.  
</P>
<P>
	The offer was worth $22.70 per BOC share, a 42 percent premium  
over BOC's price on May 10 when merger speculation began. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Liquide said it will ultimately own all the British and  
Irish gases operations of BOC and substantially all of the 
operations in Japan and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Products will own BOC operations in Australia and New  
Zealand and significant operations elsewhere in Asia, including the 
BOC interests in Singapore, southern China and Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Liquide and Air Products will each own some of the U.S.  
businesses of BOC and some of the remaining gases businesses, 
including those in South Africa, on a country by country or region 
by region basis. 
</P>
<P>
	BOC's unions expressed fears today that the merger could result  
in major job losses for the company's 11,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This takeover is a disaster for British jobs and for the  
British chemical industry,'' said Roger Lyons, general secretary of 
the Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Alain Joly, chairman and chief executive of Air Liquide, said he  
did not expect big layoffs in Britain. ``Since we do not have 
significant overlaps there are not going to be significant 
redundancies in the field operations, with the possible exception 
of the United States,'' he said.

	HAVANA (AP) -- The president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce  
landed in Cuba on Tuesday to promote more private enterprise in the 
communist country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here to observe changes in the economic and political  
system, and particularly in learning about the independent 
businesses setting up in the country,'' Thomas Donohue said after 
his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	The business leader met with Ricardo Alarcon, president of  
Cuba's National Assembly, the unicameral parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip was permitted by the U.S. Treasury Department, which  
must license such missions because of the long-standing U.S. trade 
embargo against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, State Department spokesman James Foley said in Washington  
he ``wouldn't read too much into this at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chamber opposes the embargo. Many countries trade freely  
with Cuba, taking the position it is a way to promote economic and 
political reform on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clinton administration continues to back the trade  
sanctions, aimed at forcing a change in Fidel Castro's government. 
</P>
<P>
	The politically powerful Cuban-American community strongly  
opposes relaxation of the U.S. stance.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A Brazilian state will conduct tests to  
determine if 500,000 tons of lime produced by a local subsidiary of 
a Belgian company is contaminated with dioxin, the Sao Paulo state 
environmental agency said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenpeace alleged in March that the dioxin-tainted lime treated  
citrus pulp was used for animal feed exported to Europe in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The subsidiary, Solvay, as well as Greenpeace and the  
Environmental Protection Agency agreed Tuesday to conduct the 
inspection at the company's lime stockpile in Santo Andre, an 
industrial suburb on the outskirts of Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the lime it produces contains dioxin ``of  
extremely low toxicity levels that don't represent a health 
hazard.''

	The 29,000-member National Association of Salvadoran Educators  
is asking for increases of $30 to $70 a month. Its members now earn 
$390 to $645 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Minister Evelyn Jacir de Lovo criticized the strike  
and told teachers not to make ``social earthquakes'' out of 
differences that can be resolved through negotiations.

	VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico (AP) -- A leading candidate for the Mexican  
governing party's presidential nomination got a big boost Tuesday -- 
the backing of important union locals in his main rival's home 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Francisco Labastida received the backing of 23 of the 36 locals  
of the Petroleum Worker's Union, including all six locals in 
Tabasco state, where his chief opponent, Roberto Madrazo served as 
governor until June. The remaining 13 locals of the 100,000-member 
union haven't endorsed any candidate yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Labastida, the former Interior secretary, and Madrazo are  
considered the two top candidates for the presidential nomination 
of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party.

first-ever primary in November to choose a candidate for the July

	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Police arrested three leaders of a strike  
by taxi and bus drivers that has brought much of Ecuador to a 
standstill, union leaders said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strike leaders warned the detentions could hinder talks to end  
the strike, which is trying to force President Jamil Mahuad to 
rescind a 13 percent gasoline price increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Police, empowered by a 60-day state of emergency declared last  
week, say they have detained 300 strikers, but would not confirm 
the arrests of the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike has become another test of Mahuad's ability to enact  
tough economic reforms demanded by international lenders to cut 
Ecuador's massive budget deficit, lower inflation and modernize its 
statist economy.

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Four convicted killers were found hanged

<P>
	Authorities ordered an investigation into the deaths at the  
high-security prison, popularly known as ``El Infierno'' or 
``Hell,'' in Escuintla, about 30 miles south of Guatemala City.

<HEADLINE> Kathleen Willey Getting Married </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The woman who accused President Clinton of  
making a sexual advance in the White House six years ago is engaged 
to be married. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Willey said she is preparing for a fall wedding to  
longtime friend Bill Schwicker, who proposed in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to get married and try to put all this behind me,''  
she told The Associated Press on Tuesday. ``It's all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Willey said Clinton groped her in 1993 near the Oval Office,  
one day before her husband was found dead of a self-inflicted 
gunshot wound. He had been distraught over financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has denied any such encounter.  
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the magazine Style Weekly, Ms. Willey said  
she fled to Schwicker's home in Florida to duck the press last

</P>
<P>
	``For a while it was indescribable,'' she said. ``I got to the

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Reach Steel Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and Russian trade negotiators struck a  
last-minute deal in which Russia agreed to limit steel shipments to 
the United States for five years to avoid punitive tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration on Tuesday hailed the agreement as a  
good compromise that will protect the U.S. industry from unfair 
import surges while not shutting off America's market to 
economically troubled countries such as Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	But a coalition of steel companies protested the pact, which  
will avert punitive tariffs of as much as 184 percent on Russian 
hot-rolled steel. The Russian agreement followed a similar deal the 
administration reached last week with Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``The steel crisis is not over,'' the five steel companies,  
including LTV Steel of Cleveland, Bethlehem Steel and U.S. Steel, 
said in a joint statement. ``Suspending trade cases in instances 
where unfair trade has caused serious injury directly undermines 
the effectiveness and credibility of U.S. trade laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LTV Steel spokesman Mark Tomasch said Russian steel will now be  
sold at a price ``that amounts to dumping'' and the deal 
``essentially is deeding them part of the U.S. steel market, so we 
think that sends the wrong message to the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley told reporters, ``These  
agreements deliver on the administration's commitment to guarantee 
that surging imports do not threaten the livelihoods of communities 
and workers around the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deals, which were signed after marathon negotiations in  
Paris, will set annual quotas for Russian steel over the next five 
years. For 1999, total shipments will be 64 percent below the highs 
reached last year when the global financial crisis caused foreign 
steel shipments to the United States to soar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian quotas will gradually rise over the next four years,  
climbing to 725,000 metric tons for hot rolled steel in 2003, the 
department said. That would still represent an 80 percent reduction 
from the 1998 level of imports of Russian hot rolled steel, U.S. 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley gave credit to Vice President Al Gore, who telephoned  
Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin twice on Monday as 
negotiators struggled to break a logjam before a midnight deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday  
in Nebraska, Gore said, ``We got an agreement that is going to 
provide predictability in our steel industry, a sharply reduced 
level of Russian imports. ... It's going to help them and it's 
going to help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, which is counting on strong union  
support to help keep the White House in Democratic hands, has been 
searching for ways to help U.S. industries being battered by a 
surge in imports that have sent America's trade deficit to record 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the same time, the administration has said it will not  
support blatant protectionist measures that would violate World 
Trade Organization trading rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Senate killed a House-passed bill that would  
have imposed global quotas on steel imports, a measure the 
administration had pledged to veto, saying it would put the United 
States in violation of WTO rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is considering a package of proposals to  
provide greater assistance to the U.S. steel industry, which has 
been forced to lay off thousands of workers because of the surge of 
imports from a number of nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said the administration's proposals, which could include  
an international conference to pressure countries to stop 
subsidizing their steel industries, should be announced by the end 
of this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Trade Minister Mikhail Fradkov, quoted by the Russian  
news agency Itar-Tass, said the steel agreement represented a ``a 
sufficiently difficult compromise for both sides, but for Russia it 
preserves an opportunity to supply steel to the American market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quota agreement was a refinement of a preliminary deal the  
two nations had announced in February. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final plan, U.S. officials said quotas for hot-rolled and  
cold-rolled steel were reduced over the five-year period from the 
levels that had been agreed to in February, while quotas for other 
types of steel such as steel bars were raised.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Stocks Bob Back 4.6 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Argentina's leading stock index  
ticked upward Tuesday, recovering about half of the ground it lost 
a day earlier on election-year worries about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merval Index of leading shares rose 4.6 percent to close at  
474.71. Bargain hunters entered the market in search of cheap 
equities after Monday's selloff, in which the index plummeted 8.7 
percent. Advancing shares more than doubled decliners on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina's deficit, an election-year recession and the ongoing  
presidential campaign for an Oct. 24 election helped sow a climate 
of investor uncertainty, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the damage was blamed on damaging remarks by  
presidential hopefuls ahead of the election. Eduardo Duhalde, the 
ruling party candidate, stirred markets with talk of supporting 
Roman Catholic church proposals calling for leniency for poorer 
countries saddled with big debts. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Tuesday he was surprised by the market action Monday.  
Speaking at a news conference, he said he was prompted to raise the 
issue after the Group of Seven leading countries recently agreed to 
broaden debt relief under the so-called Heavily Indebted Poor 
Countries Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Duhalde's main competitor for the presidency, Fernando de la Rua  
of the opposition Alliance, told Argentine television that all 
politicians should measure their words when discussing issues like 
debt restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this one must be careful with what one says,'' de la Rua  
said. ``We need to act with a lot of seriousness to affirm 
confidence in the Argentine economy.''

<HEADLINE> Grains Lower; Soybeans Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat and corn futures retreated Tuesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean futures finished mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat and corn futures finished only marginally lower in listless  
trading, however, as conflicting weather reports kept pricing action 
to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
        The National Weather Service's 10-day forecast, released after  
trading ended Monday, called for above-normal rainfall in key Midwest 
growing states, including Illinois and Iowa. But some private forecasters 
continue to predict only scant rainfall as temperatures climb once 
more into the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
        If those forecasts hold true, the crops could begin to see  
some weather-related stress that might reduce yields. Still, analysts 
believe that much of the corn crop is out of the woods after going 
through the crucial pollination period in which kernels form. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans also faced the same differing weather reports, but  
edged higher on continued reports of strong export demand for soybean 
meal. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery fell 1 cent to $2.59 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1/4 cent to $1.96 1/2 a bushel; December oats fell 
1/4 cent to $108 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 1 cent to $4. 
19 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef and lean hog futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while pork bellies finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
        August live cattle fell .68 cent to 63.12 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .50 cent to 76.97 cents a pound; August lean hogs 
fell 1.55 cents to 44.42 cents a pound; August pork bellies rose .40 
cent to 33.27 cents a pound.

	Company Charged in ValuJet Crash  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A maintenance firm for ValuJet was charged today  
with murder and manslaughter in the 1996 Everglades crash that 
killed 110 people. SabreTech Inc. also was charged with unlawful 
transportation of hazardous waste. The third-degree murder and 
second-degree manslaughter charges, both state charges, are 
felonies. It was not immediately clear what penalties the company 
could face. Federal indictments were also expected today, naming 
SabreTech employees involved in the packaging of the illegal cargo 
blamed for the crash, Justice Department sources told The 
Associated Press.

	Resendez-Ramirez Surrenders in Texas  
</P>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, the train-riding  
fugitive suspected of killing eight people, surrendered at a border 
checkpoint today in a deal brokered by his sister. The 39-year-old 
drifter, who is charged or wanted for questioning in three states, 
surrendered to Texas Rangers Sgt. Drew Carter, state investigators 
said. The surrender agreement included assurances of family 
visitation rights, a psychological evaluation and promises that 
Resendez-Ramirez would be safe in jail, said state Department of 
Public Safety Capt. Bruce Casteel. It does not shield him from the 
death penalty.

	Clinton Wants Tax Cut Resistance  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- President Clinton today urged congressional  
Republicans to resist the temptation of a large tax cut and instead 
devote more of the expected federal budget surpluses to salvaging 
Social Security and Medicare. Clinton said it would be a mistake if 
Republicans opt for an immediate, large tax reduction without 
finding a way to extend the life of the programs. House Republicans 
today officially rolled out a proposed $864 billion tax cut that 
would reduce income tax rates by 10 percent over a decade, cut 
capital-gains rates and eliminate the ``marriage penalty.''

	Kasich To Withdraw, Endorse Bush  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ohio Rep. John Kasich has decided to withdraw  
from the race for the Republican presidential nomination and 
intends to endorse Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Republican officials 
said today. The officials said they expected Bush to be present for 
Kasich's formal announcement, set for tomorrow afternoon. 
Republican officials said they did not expect the 47-year-old 
Kasich to reverse an earlier decision to retire from Congress at 
the end of his current term. The Ohio Republican was first elected 
to the House in 1982.

	Balkan Funding May Hinder Other Aid  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The hundreds of millions of dollars it  
will cost to rebuild the Balkans may sap the world's ability to 
respond to other humanitarian crises, the president of the World 
Bank said today. James Wolfensohn spoke as finance ministers from 
the top seven industrialized democracies and other officials 
launched a campaign to raise $500 million for reconstruction in 
Kosovo and surrounding nations. Wolfensohn warned that it may be 
difficult to handle multiple humanitarian projects at once -- and he 
insisted that rebuilding Kosovo should not come at the expense of 
aid to Asia, Africa or other areas that have not captured the 
attention of the media or the public.

	Nasal Spray Prevents Flu  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An ouchless flu vaccine that is sprayed up the  
nose has proved effective in protecting people against the virus. 
``There are significant hurdles, but our goal is to have it 
available for the flu season of 2000-2001,'' said Dr. J. Leighton 
Reed, chairman of Aviron Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., which 
developed the vaccine and helped pay for the research. The nasal 
vaccine, called FluMist, would offer an alternative to the standard 
flu shot millions of Americans get in the arm each year. It still 
needs Food and Drug Administration approval.

second-quarter profit reports. Just before the close, the Dow Jones 
industrial average was down 19.31 at 11,181.67 after having 
achieved three closing highs in the past four sessions. NYSE 
decliners led advancers 1,793-1,172. The Nasdaq composite index 
fell 10.85 to 2,779.59.

	All-Stars Set To Play in Boston  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Many of the players on the All-Star roster are  
excited about playing tonight's game at 87-year-old Fenway Park, 
which is one of the oldest parks in baseball. Ten-time All-Star Ken 
Griffey Jr., who considers Fenway ``a classic,'' plans to chip some 
paint from the famed Green Monster, the left field wall. Tony 
Gwynn, who will sit out the game due to injuries, brought a book 
detailing the park's history. He still wanted to take batting 
practice and maybe field a few balls off the wall. The Red Sox hope 
to build a new ballpark by the 2003 season.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sues Toyota Over Smog Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Toyota stands accused by the federal  
government of putting faulty smog-control computers on 2.2 million 
1996-1998 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit against the  
automaker's U.S. subsidiary Monday on behalf of the Environmental 
Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting under the Clean Air Act the suit in U.S. District Court  
here seeks to have the computers repaired and the company fined up 
to $58.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The suite was filed after Toyota rejected a government  
settlement offer last week that might have cost it $100 million in 
civil fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese-owned Toyota company is the first automaker that  
has refused to settle a Clean Air Act case with the government. 
Since 1995, Cadillac, Honda, Ford and seven heavy-duty diesel 
engine makers have reached multimillion-dollar Clean Air Act 
settlements with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The government always seeks up to the maximum civil penalty the  
act allows. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're asking for an appropriate penalty and notifying the  
court that the parameters are somewhere between zero and $58 
billion,'' said Joel Gross, chief of Justice's environmental 
enforcement section. The law allows the judge to take into account 
a company's economic gain from the violation, its history of 
compliance and remedies and whether a fine would allow a company to 
stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, the penalty is $25,000 per car sold before Jan.  
31, 1997, and $27,500 for each car sold after that date. The 
government did not know the exact dates on which the 1997 model 
vehicles were sold -- 857,620 of the 2.2 million total -- so the top 
penalty was between $56.4 billion and $58.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also did not specify what actions would be  
necessary to remedy the problem on existing cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates for the cost of repairing or replacing all the Toyota  
smog-control computers range up to $550 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At Toyota Motor Sales USA, the company's U.S. subsidiary in  
Torrance, Calif., Senior Vice President Jim Olson said Monday, 
``Toyota continues to be disappointed that despite our vehicles 
having the best in-use emission performance in the industry, this 
matter has not yet been resolved in a mutually agreeable manner.'' 
He argued that regulators had reinterpreted their rules after 
Toyota's equipment was approved.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Tours N.Y. Beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WANTAGH, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton talked welfare  
reform with suburban New Yorkers and house prices with Long Island 
beachgoers on Tuesday as she continued a tour of the state in a 
prelude to a likely Senate run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard about it literally all my life, from many friends  
who would come here and spend lots of glorious summer days,'' Mrs. 
Clinton said before a cheering crowd of several hundred people at 
Jones Beach. ``I'm just delighted to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, two Republicans who are likely GOP contenders for the  
Senate seat continued jockeying for the support of Washington 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Lazio, a Long Island congressman, announced Tuesday that  
several Senate GOP leaders, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott among 
them, would be holding a Washington fund-raiser for him. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund-raiser came after a June 17 fund-raising dinner in  
Washington for New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, also hosted by 
Lott and other GOP senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who has established an exploratory committee for a  
likely Senate campaign, chatted with shirtless men, women in 
bikinis and several dozen others in her beach stop. 
</P>
<P>
	She began making visits through the state last week in what she  
has described as a ``listening tour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also talked about her househunt, remarking on the high cost  
of real estate like any other middle-class New Yorker might: ``If I 
can afford it, I'd buy, but I probably will end up renting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said she'd looked at some houses herself, seen  
brochures and videos and gotten reports from friends who'd checked 
out properties for her, but she hasn't yet made up her mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Melanie Antonelli, a hair salon owner from upstate Cornwall,  
said she was a Republican but would vote for Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need more women in politics,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton began Tuesday at Westchester Community College in  
Valhalla at a forum with 50 parents, educators, students and former 
welfare recipients who now have jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I support welfare reform,'' she said. ``I believe we needed to  
make those changes, but it can only work if we have childcare, 
support and other necessities that people need to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rebecca Hodges, a once-homeless, single mother who now works at  
a center for AIDS patients after getting a childcare grant, said 
she worries about losing the grant and appreciated Mrs. Clinton's 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``It showed me she was concerned,'' Miss Hodges said. ``She  
really was listening. She was very friendly, very open to 
suggestion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``She spoke in generalities. I wouldn't think Giuliani would  
have any problem agreeing with any of it,'' said Sarah Stern, a 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also expressed support for universal  
pre-kindergarten, which New York state has declined to fund; for 
making college tuition tax-deductible; and for a federal initiative 
to pay for school construction that the White House has backed but 
Congress has not. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a lot of old schools and a lot of fast-growing  
suburbs,'' she said. ``It's not just an inner-city problem, it's 
also a suburban -- and as I learned last week -- a rural problem as 
well. The local tax burden in many parts of New York is incredibly 
high.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged Railway Killer in Custody </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, the rail-riding  
fugitive suspected of killing eight people who lived near railroad 
tracks, surrendered at a border checkpoint today in a deal brokered 
by his sister, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old drifter, who is charged or wanted for  
questioning in the slayings in three states and was on the FBI's 10 
Most Wanted List, surrendered at the Ysleta port of entry to Texas 
Rangers Sgt. Drew Carter, state investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez's sister, who lives in Albuquerque, N.M., called Carter  
on Sunday while he was on a West Coast fishing trip and said she 
had been in touch with her brother through an intermediary, said 
Mike Cox, state Department of Public Safety spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, an FBI agent and a deputy U.S. marshal met with the  
sister Sunday night and Monday to negotiate a surrender on a 
burglary warrant related to one of the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez was being held at the El Paso County Jail this  
morning, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	His ability to elude law enforcement had been an embarrassment  
to law enforcement. On June 2, he was released by Border Patrol 
agents, even though he was already wanted by the FBI, and Houston 
police had told the immigration service they wanted him for 
questioning in a murder. The Border Patrol agents had picked him up 
for illegal entry and sent him back to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	But Immigration Commissioner Doris Meissner said the Immigration  
and Naturalization Service, parent of the Border Patrol, had 
multiple entries on Resendez-Ramirez in a computerized photo and 
fingerprint database that provides immediate identification of 
aliens apprehended by the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after that release, authorities believe, he killed a  
73-year-old woman west of Houston. The following day, they say, he 
killed a 26-year-old Houston schoolteacher at her home. His 
fingerprints then were found June 15 in Gorham, Ill., at the scene 
of the slaying of a 79-year-old man and his 51-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS first encountered Resendez-Ramirez in 1976 after he was  
arrested in Michigan. He was returned to Mexico, but since then has 
been deported from the United States three times -- in 1985, 1987 
and 1991. He also was apprehended by Border Patrol agents eight 
times since January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissner said the Justice Department inspector general would  
look at why Resendez-Ramirez ``was not detained and whether INS 
knew about Resendez-Ramirez's criminal activities after being 
contacted by local law enforcement earlier this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the killings in June, Lexington, Ky., police  
obtained warrants last month for Resendez-Ramirez's arrest in 
connection with the August 1997 murder of University of Kentucky 
student Christopher Maier, who was attacked with his girlfriend as 
they walked near some railroad tracks. The girlfriend, who was 
raped, survived. The charges are murder, two counts of first-degree 
robbery and single counts of rape and assault. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was linked to the Dec. 17, 1998, sex slaying of Dr.  
Claudia Benton, 39, at her home in West University Place, a 
well-to-do community that is surrounded by the city of Houston; and 
the slayings of the Rev. Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic, 46, and his wife, 
Karen, 47, in the parsonage behind Weimar (Texas) United Church of 
Christ. They were beaten to death with a sledgehammer and were 
found May 2 after they failed to show up for Sunday services. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect's real name is Angel Leoncio Reyes Recendis,  
according to a birth certificate, but authorities had been using 
the name Resendez-Ramirez, one of his aliases.

<HEADLINE> All-Star Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The debate over who's the best shortstop in the  
American League is sure to be a hot topic for years to come. It 
certainly caught the attention of this year's All-Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``What these guys are doing is really exciting,'' said Cal  
Ripken, who defined the role of power-hitting shortstop more than a 
decade ago. ``The best thing about it is they're doing it both 
offensively and defensively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With much of the focus on the fans picking Boston's Nomar  
Garciaparra to start over New York's Derek Jeter on Tuesday night, 
what's lost is that perhaps the best shortstop is home watching. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Rodriguez, who missed one month with a knee injury, is  
coming off a 40 homer-40 stolen base season and is hitting .316 
with 18 homers and 48 RBIs this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Those used to be unheard of numbers for a shortstop. Now, he's  
just one of the pack with Garciaparra and Jeter. 
</P>
<P>
	``They hit the ball for power, put up numbers, steal bases;  
those guys can do it all,'' said Cleveland's Omar Vizquel, who beat 
out Rodriguez this year. ``To have three like that in the same 
league is really exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They each have their own unique accomplishments. Jeter has won  
two World Series in three years, Garciaparra is the first shortstop 
to hit more than 30 homers in each of his first two seasons, and 
Rodriguez is the first infielder to be a 40-40 man and has won a 
batting title. 
</P>
<P>
	``We push each other,'' Jeter said. ``You can't let down, not  
when there are guys out there as good or better than you.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SHORT MEMORIES:* Red Sox fans made their feelings known toward  
former Boston ace Roger Clemens, who now pitches for the hated 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans wore T-shirts saying, ``Hey Roger Clemens, we're at  
the All-Star game at Fenway Park and you're not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, the career victory leader for the Red Sox, did in fact  
show up to be honored as one of the 100 greatest players this 
century. Most of the Fenway fans booed his introduction. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *A LEAGUE OF HIS OWN:* Dave Nilsson is one of the few players  
who could truly understand both sides of labor issues. Not only an 
All-Star catcher for the Milwaukee Brewers, Nilsson bought the 
struggling Australian baseball league for $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Nilsson's goal is to start a South Pacific version of winter  
baseball in the Caribbean. American players will be allowed to 
play, but the focus will be on the local talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players there are good enough that unless there are very  
good pro players coming over, we don't want to take away a spot,'' 
Nilsson said. ``Pros won't take the place of local kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nilsson's devotion to baseball in his homeland runs so deep that  
he might pass up the riches of free agency next year to play for 
Australia in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love major league baseball, but I also want to play for my  
country,'' he said. ``I'll make a decision at the end of the year 
when the emotions die down.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BACK TO FENWAY:* Baseball didn't have much luck the last time  
the All-Star game was played at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1961, three weeks after Stu Miller was blown off the mound by  
the wind at Candlestick Park, baseball came to Boston for its 
second All-Star game. (From 1959-62, baseball played two All-Star 
games.) 
</P>
<P>
	Rain was the element that left its impact on that game. A storm  
rolled in with the game tied at 1 after nine innings and the game 
was called. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was wet,'' NL All-Star Frank Robinson said of his first  
game at Fenway. ``That's all I remember.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, one of baseball's most competitive players, is not up  
for a continuation of that game before this year's contest. But he 
might like to take a few cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to get another shot at that wall,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FAMILY TRADITION:* San Diego Padres closer Trevor Hoffman heard  
all about Fenway Park from his older brother, Glenn, who played in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	So he took the opportunity this week to show his two sons the  
inner workings of Fenway. After playing a game of Whiffle ball in 
left field, Hoffman took his son, Quinn, into the Green Monster. 
</P>
<P>
	He searched for Glenn's name carved on the inside of the wall  
and added his beneath it. Then he gave Quinn a piece of pink chalk 
and told him to add a `Q.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you're up there,'' Hoffman said. ``It's awesome.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BIG MAC'S BIG SHOTS:* How impressive was Mark McGwire's Home  
Run Derby performance? Carlton Fisk said even a new Fenway Park 618 
feet from the original location couldn't hold Big Mac's shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of those balls that Mark McGwire hit last night, if they  
hit them in the new ballpark, they would have gone out of the old 
ballpark,'' Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BASE HITS:* Roberto Alomar is the fifth player to make the  
All-Star game for four teams, joining Walker Cooper, Rich Gossage, 
George Kell and Lee Smith. Alomar has played for San Diego, 
Toronto, Baltimore and now Cleveland. ... Commissioner Bud Selig, 
who helped force former commissioner Fay Vincent out in 1992, sat 
in front of his predecessor Tuesday. Selig has tried to patch up 
their relationship in the past year.

<P>
	Key dates in the case of Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, suspected in  
eight slayings in Texas, Kentucky and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Aug. 29, 1997 -- Christopher Maier, 21-year-old student at  
University of Kentucky, is killed as he and his girlfriend take 
shortcut along the railroad tracks from one party to another. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Journal Spurs Dow Jones Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dow Jones &AMP; Co. credited strong growth in  
advertising in The Wall Street Journal for second-quarter net 
earnings of $57.2 million, results that beat Wall Street 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The profits reported Tuesday were equivalent to 62 cents per  
share, better than the 61 cents predicted by analysts surveyed by 
First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same quarter a year ago, Dow Jones had a net loss of  
$51.7 million, or 54 cents per share, mainly because of a loss on 
the sale of its money-losing Telerate subsidiary, a financial 
markets information service. Without the Telerate loss, the company 
earned $54.7 million, or 56 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 4.9 percent to $510.6 million from $486.7 million,  
not counting results from the Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones chairman Peter Kann attributed the earnings growth to  
improved results from the Journal and the company's Ottaway 
community newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Advertising lineage at The Wall Street Journal rose 6.9 percent  
in the quarter and 18.9 percent in June. Excluding a one-time 
charge in connection with severance costs after converting to 
electronic pagination of the Journal, the company's publishing 
operations posted an 18.4 percent rise in operating income to $82.6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from electronic publishing rose 1.4 percent to $98.8  
million. But operating income in that segment fell 44 percent to 
$10.2 million due to increased spending on advertising and higher 
costs for content. Dow Jones reported that the online Journal now 
has 306,000 subscribers, making it the largest paid subscription 
site on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Not counting the results from Telerate, Dow Jones' earnings for  
the first six months of the year edged up to $108.7 million, or 
$1.18 per share, from $104.3 million, or $1.07 per share, in the 
same period a year ago. Revenues rose to $972.7 million from $936.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones stock edged up 6 1/4 cents to $52.68 3/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Brandi Chastain may have created the best-known  
new undie since the Wonderbra when she doffed her jersey after 
delivering the winning kick at the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike, which makes sports bras for the U.S. women's soccer team,  
is now trying to figure out how to convert that moment of marketing 
magic into new sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain and her teammates are seeing a burst of marketing  
interest that experts had predicted if the team won the title. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of Wheaties said Tuesday it has begun talks about  
putting the team's picture on the box. And Walt Disney has been 
running its signature post-championship television ads with the 
team shouting ``We're going to Disneyland'' and ``We're going to 
Disney World.'' The World Cup matches drew unexpectedly large 
crowds to arenas across the country in the past three weeks and the 
TV ratings grew as the tournament climaxed last Saturday in the 
Rose Bowl where the United States beat China in the finale. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Solomon, a top commercial buyer at SFM Media, said Tuesday  
that team members captured American's imagination ``not only by 
their playing but by their demeanor'' and expects the feeling will 
have ``some staying power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't argue, they didn't bad-mouth anybody, they were  
always going out of their way to be gracious. The whole idea of the 
teamwork aspect captured the fancy of the public,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Reith, a spokeswoman for Nike, said Chastain was one of  
10 U.S. team members wearing the new Nike Inner Actives sports bra 
that goes on sale for $40 on July 25. 
</P>
<P>
	She insisted Nike had not scripted Chastain's decision to rip  
off her jersey and expose the black bra. She noted Chastain has 
described it as a moment of ``temporary insanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, she said Nike ``certainly will capitalize on it.''  
The company will use a photo of Chastain in her sports bra for 
displays in stores and may have Chastain make extra personal 
appearances promote the bra. But Reith was unaware of any broader 
advertising plans. 
</P>
<P>
	A picture of Chastain in her sports bra drew a hearty cheer at a  
rally staged by Nike on Tuesday in midtown Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Colson, managing editor of Sports Illustrated, presented  
Chastain -- who was fully clothed -- with a giant framed copy of the 
magazine's upcoming cover, featuring her kneeling on the field in 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, General Mills Inc. is talking with the team and the  
players about an appearance on a Wheaties cereal box, company 
spokesman Greg Zimprich said Tuesday. ``We are definitely 
interested,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company from Golden Valley, Minn., has heard from hundreds  
of people wondering if the team will be featured on the boxes as 
champions like the U.S. women's hockey team was after winning gold 
in the 1998 Olympics in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been inundated with calls,'' said company spokeswoman  
Natalie Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
	Mia Hamm, a member of the soccer team, had earlier told Fox News  
Channel that it appeared Wheaties was not interested, and added she 
and her teammates ``like the sweeter cereals'' anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney shot two ads with the soccer team Saturday in the Rose  
Bowl after its victory. The television spots were airing around the 
nation on Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been using the approach in similar ads for its  
theme parks for the past 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Marketing experts have warned the team's notoriety could prove  
short-lived because of the lack of a women's professional league 
and America's relative disinterest in soccer versus other sports 
like football, baseball and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will stay in the public's eye for at least several  
months thanks to a planned soccer exhibition tour. 
</P>
<P>
	It will compete against a world all-star team in 11 matches  
starting Oct. 22 in Pittsburgh and ending Dec. 12 in Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Berke, a vice president at the sports marketing firm SFX  
Sports Group which helped organize the tour, said it will allow the 
players to earn money from soccer, stay close to their fans and 
demonstrate the viability of a professional league. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a number of sponsors including beverage, financial  
services and packaged goods companies have expressed interest in 
the tour. He said talks are underway about producing a TV special 
during the tour.

<HEADLINE>  Khrushchev's Son Becomes US Citizen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Nikita Khrushchev's son has become a  
U.S. citizen, vowing to defend the capitalist lifestyle that his 
father long ago vowed would soon be humbled by communism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling like a newborn. It's the beginning of a new  
life,'' the 64-year-old Sergei Khrushchev said Monday after taking 
the oath of citizenship inside a Roman Catholic school auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	At his side was his wife, Valentina Golenko, who also became an  
American. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair became citizens nearly 40 years after the famous  
Kitchen Debate between former Soviet leader Khrushchev and 
then-Vice President Richard Nixon in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	``In another seven years, we will be on the same level as  
America,'' Khrushchev told Nixon then. ``When we catch you up, in 
passing you by, we will wave to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sergei Khrushchev, once a Soviet missile engineer, has lived in  
the United States since 1991, when he began teaching a class in 
Cold War history at Brown University in Providence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Khrushchevs took up a typical American existence, driving  
two American cars and living in a suburban ranch home in nearby 
Cranston. The home has central air, a Jacuzzi and an entertainment 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, they joined 242 others in becoming Americans,  
replying ``I do'' after U.S. District Judge Ronald Lagueux asked if 
they promised to be good citizens. The group then recited the 
Pledge of Allegiance; most of them, including Khrushchev, held 
miniature American flags. 
</P>
<P>
	In a June interview with The Associated Press, Khrushchev said  
he hoped his father ``would be supportive'' of his new American 
citizenship. Nikita Khrushchev died in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	``After all,'' he said, ``it's not as if I'm defecting.''  
</P>
<P>
	Still, some in Russia apparently see betrayal in Khrushchev's  
move. His son, working in Russia to gather material for his 
father's Cold War books, has reported government officials have 
hindered him since the citizenship quest was reported. 
</P>
<P>
	As he left Monday's ceremony, Khrushchev said he didn't think  
relatives in his homeland would face hostility because of his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, no!'' he replied. ``You're still living in the Cold War.  
It's a different Russia.''

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Soccer Team Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- President Jiang Zemin led an official welcoming  
ceremony Tuesday for the Chinese women's soccer team, which brought 
home a World Cup silver medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-4 loss to the United States on overtime penalty kicks in a  
politically charged match chagrined Chinese fans. But their sorrow 
has been tempered by pride that China's women made it to the finals 
and held the Americans scoreless in regular play. 
</P>
<P>
	``You didn't disappoint the wishes of the masses,'' Jiang told  
the team during a reception at the Great Hall of the People in the 
center of Beijing. ``You showed on the playing field the 
self-reliance and self-confidence of Chinese women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team returned Monday night from the United States to a  
raucous welcome by hundreds of fans who beat drums, crashed cymbals 
and sang the Chinese national anthem outside Beijing airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at the ceremony Tuesday were Communist Party leaders Li  
Peng, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao and Wei Jianxing. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Chinese had looked on the World Cup final in Pasadena,  
Calif., as a grudge match against a rival with whom China has a 
range of political and trade disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiang said he hoped the women's soccer team and other Chinese  
athletes made ``persistent efforts'' to win other honors for the 
country.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Prints New Currency Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore will issue a new series of currency  
notes to mark the millennium, the government announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills will have new themes, colors and high-tech additions  
to prevent counterfeiting, the Board of Commissioners of Currency 
of Singapore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Security features include a so-called latent image, which  
changes from one picture to another when viewed from different 
angles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although currency counterfeiting has never been a serious  
problem in Singapore, the advent of ... color copiers and computer 
scanners has prompted the BCCS to take additional precautionary 
measures,'' the board said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The new notes will have the country's first showing a portrait  
of a person, Singapore's first President Yusof bin Ishak, said the 
board's director of administration, Martin Teo. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the bills' seven denominations -- from 2 to 10,000  
Singapore dollars -- will portray the themes of education, garden 
city, sports, arts, youth, government and economics. 
</P>
<P>
	The denominations will remain the same, with bills of 2, 5, 10,  
50, 100, 1,000 and 10,000 Singapore dollars. Some new bills will be 
slightly smaller in size, and the 100 and 10,000 Singapore dollar 
bills will undergo color changes, the board said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash will debut at an exhibition Sept. 9, when visitors can  
exchange old money for it. Banks will begin circulating the new 
bills alongside existing ones on Sept. 13, Teo said. 
</P>
<P>
	One Singapore dollar currently trades at 59 U.S. cents.

<HEADLINE> Rio Sues U.S. Tobacco Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Rio state government announced  
Tuesday it has begun a lawsuit against U.S. tobacco firms in a bid 
to recover the public health care costs of treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, the first of it kind by a Brazilian authority, was  
launched by four Texas lawyers acting for the state, said 
government lawyer Jose Calisto Ushoa Ribeiro. On Tuesday, the four 
filed papers in a U.S. court. 
</P>
<P>
	Ribeiro declined to immediately name the state, ``for strategic  
reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The lawsuit will be against all the American tobacco companies  
who, either directly or indirectly, have caused the government of 
Rio to incur costs in public health care,'' Ribeiro said at a news 
conference. He named 15 firms involved including Philip Morris and 
RJR Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit would likely be for billions of dollars, said  
Ribeiro. The state would begin to calculate the cost of treating 
cancer patients and those with smoking-related illnesses over ``the 
last 20 or 30 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Texan lawyers -- W. Mark Lanier, Charles Siegel, Vaughan O.  
Stewart and Henry Saint Dahl -- will pay all costs and receive a 
percentage of any damages received, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a radio interview, Rio governor Anthony Garotinho said he  
hoped to negotiate a settlement and expected the state to receive 
$10 billion in reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Brazil's Health Minister Jose Serra met with U.S.  
lawyers to discuss a possible lawsuit by the federal government 
against U.S. tobacco companies. He has not announced plans to begin 
legal action.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Earnings Beat Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Motorola Inc.'s second-quarter earnings beat Wall  
Street expectations Tuesday as it continued to benefit from a 
rebound in its semiconductor business and strong digital cellular 
phone sales. 
</P>
<P>
	For the period ending July 3, the company earned from operations  
of $273 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with $6 million, or 
1 cent a share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street expectations of 41 cents a share,  
according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola also recorded a charge of $94 million, reflecting a  
move to prop up its 18 percent investment in the Iridium 
go-anywhere satellite phone project. The year-ago quarter included 
a charge of $1.91 billion for restructuring. Including the charges, 
Motorola earned $206 million, compared to a loss of $1.3 billion in 
the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola shares fell $2.50 to $96.50 during a general retreat  
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. Earnings were released 
after trading had ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales jumped 7 percent to $7.5 billion from $7 billion. As  
expected by analysts, Motorola's paging and wireless infrastructure 
segments remained sluggish, but the sales results reflected an 
overall improvement in Motorola's outlook and of the semiconductor 
industry in general. 
</P>
<P>
	For Motorola, sales of semiconductors -- the chips that run  
everything from phones to computers -- jumped 9 percent for the 
quarter to $2 billion, while orders jumped 20 percent. That was 
helped by a boost in orders from all regions except Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel Corp. on Tuesday also reported a rebound in its  
computer-chip business, although its profits were below forecasts. 
The Semiconductor Industry Association reported last week that 
sales were up 11 percent in May as the Asian economy showed signs 
of a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	After long delays in introducing digital wireless phones, the  
Schaumburg, Ill.-based company appeared to be gaining on 
competitors Nokia, Ericsson and Qualcomm. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported orders jumped 21 percent in the quarter to  
$3.2 billion, helped in part by Bell Atlantic's purchase of 1 
million digital StarTac phones and accompanying accessories. Sales 
rose 17 percent to $2.8 billion for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news, however, was tempered by warnings the third  
quarter could be further affected by Motorola's Iridium 
obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubled company has repeatedly received extensions from its  
creditors as it falls well short of the amount of subscribers it 
had promised would be on board by earlier this year. Motorola 
indicated it will play a major hand in Iridium's recent efforts to 
restructure its business, lower costs and bring in new customers.

<HEADLINE> Veterinarian Guilty in Cruelty Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLD BRIDGE, N.J. (AP) -- A veterinarian accused of choking,  
throwing and punching pets under his care was found guilty of 
cruelty to animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal Judge Emery Toth convicted Dr. Howard Baker yesterday  
and ordered him to pay $3,500, attend anger management classes and 
perform community service. 
</P>
<P>
	The case centered on a video secretly made by an animal rights  
activist who had been a Baker assistant. The tape showed the doctor 
striking a Dalmatian twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker was also accused, among other things, of grasping a cat  
around the neck and flailing it to its death. 
</P>
<P>
	He denied the cruelty allegations, saying he gave only light  
slaps or taps to pets and grabbed cats by the scruff of the neck to 
calm them. He said the Dalmatian had tried to bite him. 
</P>
<P>
	The former assistant ``was one witness in the face of four  
others who were there and said it didn't happen,'' defense attorney 
Michael Rosenbaum said. ``That's round one. We have a bunch more 
rounds to go.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Tax Cut Resistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- President Clinton today urged congressional  
Republicans to resist the temptation of a large tax cut and instead 
devote more of the expected federal budget surpluses to salvaging 
Social Security and Medicare. ``Join us in putting first things 
first,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said it would be a mistake if -- 16 months before the  
next presidential election -- Republicans opt for an immediate, 
large tax reduction, ``whether it's right for America or not,'' 
without finding a way to extend the life of programs on which 
millions of senior citizens depend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize that it's tempting. It's a severe test for us,''  
Clinton said of the surplus. He noted that his administration's 
proposal for the surplus combined smaller tax cuts with protections 
for Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can still have a good-sized tax cut, but not as large as  
the one the Republicans propose,'' he said in a speech to the 
annual convention of the Communications Workers of America. ``I am 
asking Republican leaders, in the interest of saving Medicare, to 
reconsider the size of their tax cut plan. ... Reduce the size of 
the tax cut and join us in putting first things first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, Clinton was attending a fund-raiser at the Coral Gables  
home of sugar magnate Alfonso Fanjul. The event was raising between 
$500,000 and $1 million for the Florida Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican congressional leaders say Clinton seems ready to work  
with them on revamping Medicare, cutting taxes and other budget 
issues, but their first face-to-face budget meeting Monday yielded 
no consensus on how to spend $2.9 trillion in budget surpluses 
expected over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want cooperation, not partisanship,'' said Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., after the hourlong session Monday 
night. ``His tone was the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, among Clinton's most  
outspoken foes, said ``there's no doubt'' Clinton's message was 
that he was ready to seriously tackle the issues separating the 
White House and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats alike cast the tone of the meeting  
positively, which considering the distrust many Republicans feel 
for Clinton might be a major achievement in itself. 
</P>
<P>
	But members of both parties, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said there was no change in the likely scenario that Clinton would 
veto a GOP-written tax cut and perhaps some spending bills before 
any substantive negotiations start, probably in September or later. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans today officially rolled out a proposed $864  
billion tax cut that would reduce income tax rates by 10 percent 
over a decade, cut capital-gains rates for individuals and 
corporations, eventually abolish estate taxes and the alternative 
minimum tax and eliminate the ``marriage penalty'' paid by millions 
of two-income couples by raising the standard deduction for them. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Clinton announced a legislative proposal to  
require employers to better inform their employees when changes are 
being made to their pension plans. Under the proposal, employers 
must offer a ``clear and complete explanation'' of pension 
reductions at least 45 days before they take effect. Under current 
law, disclosures must be made at least 15 days in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee, said the tax cut could be accomplished without 
threatening Social Security and Medicare or forcing cuts in key 
programs. He said the plan reflected GOP priorities to reduce the 
size of government. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are talking about is a defining difference between the  
Republicans and Democrats,'' said Archer, R-Texas. ``We believe the 
people can spend their money more wisely than the bureaucrats in 
Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the White House meeting was over, the dispute between the  
two sides loomed as large as ever. 
</P>
<P>
	While they generally agree the $1.9 trillion part of the surplus  
generated by Social Security should be used to reduce the national 
debt, Republicans want to use most of the remaining $1 trillion for 
tax cuts. Clinton and Democrats want to use it for Medicare, a much 
smaller $250 billion tax reduction, and defense and domestic 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're not going to do is collapse to their position if we  
think their position is wrong-headed,'' said House Minority Leader 
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. ``We think it's wrong to do a $1 trillion tax 
cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats familiar with the meeting said Clinton opened it by  
saying that prior to considering a tax cut, the two sides first 
must agree to revamp Social Security and Medicare for the 
retirement of the 76 million baby boomers, beginning in a decade.

<HEADLINE> Male Soccer Team Readies for Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- U.S. national men's team coach Bruce Arena watched  
every minute and every kick of the victory the U.S. women's team 
enjoyed over China. But not once did he figure it would add any 
pressure on him or his team as it prepares for the upcoming 
Confederation Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I congratulate them for winning, but don't feel any more  
pressure at all for us to win a world championship,'' Arena said. 
``I don't anticipate us winning one, not with the talented teams of 
the world like Brazil and Mexico, but see us doing well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arena has more pressing matters. On Tuesday night, the U.S.  
men's team played Derby County Club of the English Premier League 
at Mile High Stadium, the team's final tuneup before the 
Confederation Cup. The Americans won 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our main objective will be to fill out our roster and a  
secondary one to train and play at altitude,'' Arena said before 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team will join some of the world's best teams for the  
July 24-Aug. 4 competition in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our players know the game is important,'' Arena said. ``We  
need to name a 20-man roster by Wednesday and I will make that 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those on the team for Tuesday night's game were veterans  
Claudio Reyna, Joe-Max Moore and Jeff Agoos. Ben Olsen and Joey 
DiGiamarino come from the Under-23 National team. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalkeeper Kasey Keller, midfielders Chris Armas, Jovan Kirovski  
and Eddie Lewis and forward Cobi Jones were key performers in the 
team's victory over Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to be successful in Mexico, we must take a healthy  
team, an experienced team and one that has depth at every 
position,'' Arena said. ``We play three matches in seven days and 
possibly four matches in nine days, so I feel every player will 
have to contribute.''

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Soccer Team Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- President Jiang Zemin led an official welcoming  
ceremony Tuesday for the Chinese women's soccer team, which brought 
home a World Cup silver medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-4 loss to the United States on overtime penalty kicks in a  
politically charged match chagrined Chinese fans. But their sorrow 
has been tempered by pride that China's women made it to the finals 
and held the Americans scoreless in regular play. 
</P>
<P>
	``You didn't disappoint the wishes of the masses,'' Jiang told  
the team during a reception at the Great Hall of the People in the 
center of Beijing. ``You showed on the playing field the 
self-reliance and self-confidence of Chinese women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team returned Monday night from the United States to a  
raucous welcome by hundreds of fans who beat drums, crashed cymbals 
and sang the Chinese national anthem outside Beijing airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at the ceremony Tuesday were Communist Party leaders Li  
Peng, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao and Wei Jianxing. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Chinese had looked on the World Cup final in Pasadena,  
Calif., as a grudge match against a rival with whom China has a 
range of political and trade disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiang said he hoped the women's soccer team and other Chinese  
athletes made ``persistent efforts'' to win other honors for the 
country.

<HEADLINE> Woman Allowed To Adopt Black Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The state has let a white woman  
adopt the 4-year-old black boy she has raised since birth, ending a 
long case by also agreeing to pay her $135,000 in legal costs for 
the discrimination lawsuit she filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a settlement approved Monday, the Florida Department of  
Children and Families also apologized to Shirley Fitzgerald and 
acknowledged it made a mistake in trying to place the boy with 
black relatives whom Fitzgerald said ignored his medical needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, named Shaq (pronounced ``Shay''), was born to a  
drug-addicted woman and has asthma, epilepsy, damaged hearing and 
delayed speech development. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement says medical opinions clearly establish it is  
best for Shaq to remain with Ms. Fitzgerald and her two adopted 
daughters, the only family he has known. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Ms. Fitzgerald agreed to drop her civil rights  
lawsuit, one of the first in the nation to challenge an adoption 
decision under state and federal anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleged state officials discriminated against Ms.  
Fitzgerald because she is white and against her adopted daughters 
because they have the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement provides for supervised, three-hour visits once a  
month between Shaq and his relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very progressive agreement,'' said Ms. Fitzgerald's  
lawyer, Alan Mishael. ``A lot of time and effort went into this to 
try to give this child the best of both worlds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgerald, 63, is a longtime foster parent for children with  
medical problems, primarily the AIDS virus. The state placed Shaq 
with her just days after he was born; he was HIV-positive at the 
time but tested negative a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaq's great-aunt and great-uncle, Carolyn and Paul Simmons, are  
raising two of his five half-siblings as foster children and sought 
custody of him in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fitzgerald alleged that the aunt didn't give Shaq  
medications as needed and that the couple's smoking triggered his 
asthma attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Simmons said Monday she didn't know anything about the  
settlement.

<HEADLINE> U.K. Gas Maker Accepts Takeover Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Air Liquide and Air Products &AMP; Chemicals Inc. will  
buy the global operations of British rival BOC Group PLC for $11.5 
billion, boosting their stakes in the expanding market for 
industrial gases. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies plan to strengthen their positions in the  
business of supplying carbon dioxide and other gases needed to put 
the fizz in soft drinks, chill imported fruits and vegetables and 
manufacture high-quality steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Liquide is the world's largest producer of industrial gases.  
BOC ranks No. 2 in the world, and Air Products, based in 
Trexlertown, Penn., is fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash deal is worth $23.36 per BOC share, a 42 percent  
premium over BOC's price on May 10 when speculation about the deal 
began. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Liquide said it will ultimately own all the British and  
Irish gases operations of BOC and substantially all of the 
operations in Japan and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Products will own BOC operations in Australia and New  
Zealand and significant operations elsewhere in Asia, including the 
BOC interests in Singapore, southern China and Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Liquide and Air Products will each own some of the U.S.  
businesses of BOC and some of the remaining gases businesses, 
including those in South Africa, on a country by country or region 
by region basis. 
</P>
<P>
	BOC's unions expressed fears Tuesday that the merger could  
result in major job losses for the company's 11,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This takeover is a disaster for British jobs and for the  
British chemical industry,'' said Roger Lyons, general secretary of 
the Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Alain Joly, chairman and chief executive of Air Liquide, said he  
did not expect big layoffs in Britain. ``Since we do not have 
significant overlaps there are not going to be significant 
redundancies in the field operations, with the possible exception 
of the United States,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	BOC stock ended Tuesday trading at 1,354 pence ($21.66) per  
share, down 1.7 percent. Air Liquide shares closed down 4.2 percent 
in Paris, at 148.50 euros ($151.47). 
</P>
<P>
	Air Products shares were trading at $41.50, up 25 cents, in  
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Suspect in Killing Spree Captured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIDNEY, Ohio (AP) -- A man suspected of killing three teen-age  
girls and his Bible study teacher surrendered early today after a 
two-hour standoff with police at a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Michael Hensley, 30, gave up around 5 a.m., ending the  
standoff in which a clerk and two customers were held hostage at 
the station about 35 miles north of Dayton, Shelby County Sheriff 
Mark Schemmel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hensley was booked on four counts of aggravated murder, Schemmel  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	No hostages were injured, he said. But Hensley was a suspect in  
an apparently unprovoked shooting earlier today of a motorist on 
Interstate 75, less than 10 miles away from the gas station, 
Schemmel said. A 47-year-old man was hospitalized in serious 
condition, the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the bodies of Sherry Kimbler, 16, a neighbor of  
Hensley's; Tosha L. Barrett, 16, Kimbler's cousin; and Amy 
Mikesell, 14, were discovered in Hensley's Sidney home after a 
22-year-old woman who had been shot escaped from the house. The 
wounded woman, Veronica Eagy, was listed in fair condition today at 
Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Wildermuth, 37, Hensley's Bible-study teacher, was later  
found shot at his home just outside of Sidney. 
</P>
<P>
	Police haven't offered offer a specific motive for the killings,  
but by all accounts Hensley was a troubled man. The Dayton Daily 
News reported he was convicted twice in four years for public 
indecency, and neighbors said he paid girls or young women to watch 
him masturbate. His pastor, the Rev. Ben Davis, said Hensley had 
been involved in devil worship but was trying to mend his ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's standoff began later after a police officer spotted  
Hensley driving erratically in the same purple car he fled in after 
the shootings Thursday, police Lt. Rod Austin said. The officer 
followed Hensley to the gas station, which police then surrounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Police reached Hensley via phone and ``were able to talk him  
out,'' said Andy Grzelewski, the station manager. 
</P>
<P>
	But the exchange led police to fear Hensley's car contained  
explosives, Austin said. Two dozen Molotov cocktails had been found 
in his basement after the killings. Police blocked off the area, 
with the help of numerous tractor-trailers, for more than three 
hours until the car could be towed away from the gas tanks to an 
empty lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say they believe that Hensley killed the girls and then  
drove with his wife, Julie Hensley, to Wildermuth's house for a 
prayer session before killing him. Mrs. Hensley summoned police to 
Wildermuth's house and has been held in protective custody since. 
</P>
<P>
	Schemmel said it wasn't known if Hensley had returned to Sidney  
today from elsewhere or had been in the area all along. But his car 
plates had been changed to Illinois plates, Austin said.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Gov. Eyes Return to Wrestling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura has slapped down any  
suggestion that his return to wrestling threatens the dignity of 
his office. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no rule that says a governor can't have fun. There's  
no rule that says a governor on his own time can't be a human,'' he 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, who wrestled professionally as ``The Body'' until  
retiring in 1986, has hinted that he may return to the ring Aug. 22 
at Target Center in Minneapolis. The sold-out ``SummerSlam'' event 
will be on pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura refused to discuss details of the event, though he has  
said a contribution would go to two charities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The perception is that people need to be professional  
politicians and that therefore being a politician is your entire 
life. Well, it's not Jesse Ventura's entire life and I think I was 
elected upon the fact that I came from being a private citizen,'' 
said Ventura, a Reform Party politician. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, state GOP Chairman Ron Eibensteiner called the  
governor's return to the ring ``an absolute outrage'' and said 
Ventura was ``using the office of governor to promote his own 
personal enrichment.''

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Growth Shifts to West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- America's high-tech industry is heading west,  
according to a study released Tuesday that puts San Jose, Calif., 
Dallas and Los Angeles at the top of a list of cities that appear 
to be thriving in the new economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The pattern of westward migration since 1978 was revealed in a  
Milken Institute study analyzing the impact of high-tech industries 
on economic growth in major metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The study concluded that communities that fail to attract  
high-technology companies risk being left behind as the dominance 
of industries such as biotechnology, telecommunications and the 
Internet grows. 
</P>
<P>
	``High technology certainly will determine which areas of the  
country are succeeding. Areas without high-tech are going to be 
left behind,'' said Ross DeVol, the report's principal author. 
``There are still remnants of the old economy around, but the new 
economy is here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Western cities hold four of the top five positions in a study  
ranking 50 cities on the basis of their concentration of 
high-technology jobs and the revenues they produce. Boston is 
ranked fourth after Los Angeles, with Seattle fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, Rochester, Minn., Williamsport, Penn. and the  
Kalamazoo-Battle Creek, Mich., area were at the top. San Jose was 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Rochester, where IBM built mainframe computers, lost ground when  
the company failed to anticipate the switch to personal computers. 
Williamsport fell off the top-50 in the early 1990s, when defense 
cutbacks led to a shakeup in the aerospace industry. 
Kalamazoo-Battle Creek fell in the rankings because its primary 
high-tech industry -- drug manufacturing -- has declined as a share 
of the overall national economy, DeVol said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings were based on a complex formula that considers several  
factors, including the impact of technology on the local economy 
and its contribution to the total revenue produced by the nation's 
high-tech companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Silicon Valley, which includes San Jose and surrounding cities,  
remains the world's technology capital despite an exceptionally 
high cost of living and problems like traffic congestion and 
housing shortages, DeVol said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very high-cost location, and there is a lot of  
(traffic) congestion, but most major firms still want to have a 
presence there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas benefitted from a diversified technology base that  
includes the world headquarters of GTE Corp. and the U.S. 
headquarters of Canada-based Nortel Corp., Stockholm-based L.M. 
Ericsson, Japan's Fujitsu LTD and the French telecommunications 
company Alcatel SA. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles' No. 3 ranking resulted from the growth of  
multimedia entertainment, including small special effects companies 
that cater to the film industry. The figures for Los Angeles, 
however, are inflated because of the way the federal government 
compiles movie-industry data.

	Company Charged in ValuJet Crash  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Murder and manslaughter charges were announced  
today against the airline maintenance company that packaged the 
oxygen canisters blamed for the 1996 ValuJet crash. The crash 
killed 110 people in the Everglades. The third-degree murder and 
second-degree manslaughter charges, both Florida state charges, are 
felonies. It was not clear what penalties the company, SabreTech 
Inc., would face if convicted. Federal indictments were also

	Intel's Second-Quarter Profit Jumps  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JOSE (AP) -- Intel Corp. reported today that its  
second-quarter profit rose 49 percent, but the results failed to 
meet Wall Street expectations amid a shift in company sales to less 
expensive computer chips. Intel, the world's largest maker of 
microprocessor chips, said it earned $1.75 billion, or 51 cents a 
share, two cents below Wall Street expectations. That compared to a 
profit of $1.17 billion, or 33 cents a share, in the second quarter 
of 1998. Revenue rose 14 percent to $6.75 billion from $5.93 
billion. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel said microprocessor 
sales dropped slightly in the second quarter compared to the first 
quarter of this year. In addition, the company's average selling 
price for chips dropped as the company sold more microprocessors 
for inexpensive personal computers. Intel stock was down 1/16 at 
65 1/8 today.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks dropped today as concerns about Latin  
America's economic recovery muted investor optimism about 
second-quarter earnings reports. At the close on Wall Street, the 
Dow Jones industrial average was down 25.96 at to 11,175.02 after 
having fallen as much as 114 points in early trading. The Dow's 
loss came after the blue chips achieved new closing highs in the 
past four sessions. Broader stock indicators also declined. The 
Nasdaq composite index fell 24.48 to 2,765.45. J.P. Morgan and 
Citigroup slipped as the financial services sector stumbled on 
worries about its exposure to weak capital markets in Latin 
America.

	FTC: No New Internet Privacy Laws  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission recommended to  
Congress today that new Internet privacy laws are not needed to 
protect consumers because companies on the Web are voluntarily 
creating rules for handling sensitive personal information. In a 
14-page report, the FTC acknowledged that the online industry's 
efforts are not widespread, and some Web sites ``still do not 
understand the importance of consumer privacy.'' But with a 3-1 
endorsement, commissioners decided that new federal privacy laws 
are ``not appropriate at this time'' for the Internet. ``That is 
not to say all that needs to be done has been done,'' FTC Chairman 
Robert Pitofsky told the House Commerce Committee's 
telecommunications panel. He said that if progress does not 
continue at about the present pace, legislation might become 
necessary.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Paine Webber Group have  
the strong stock market to thank for their robust second-quarter 
earnings, which beat analysts' expectations. Merrill Lynch today 
reported net earnings of $664 million, or $1.57 a share, compared 
with $540 million, or $1.31 a share in the second quarter last 
year. The positive news came less than 24 hours after Merrill's 
president and chief operating officer abruptly resigned. Paine 
Webber reported profits of $157.6 million, or $1.02 a share. Those 
results were 27 percent better than the year-ago quarter when Paine 
Webber earned $123.6 million, or 82 cents a share.

	SUV Sales Growth Still High but...  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- While sales of sport utility vehicles continue to  
increase faster than any other segment of the automotive market, 
demand for some models is leveling off as the category becomes more 
crowded. Demand has fallen, though, among models that have not been 
redesigned in several years. Industrywide, SUV sales were up 11 
percent in the first half, while the entire car and light truck 
market was up 7 percent. While the torrid sales pace of the last 
few years is unlikely to be sustained, analysts don't forecast a 
drop in SUV sales anytime soon.

	U.S., Russia Sign Steel Agreement  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia has agreed to limit shipments of steel  
to the United States over a five-year period to avoid imposition of 
punitive American tariffs, Commerce Secretary William Daley 
announced today. The two sides signed the agreements covering 
different types of steel following marathon bargaining talks in 
Paris. The deals will set annual quotas for Russian steel 
shipments, reducing imports for all Russian steel shipments by 64 
percent this year compared to 1998, the Commerce Department said in 
a fact sheet. The quotas will gradually rise over four years, 
climbing to a high of 725,000 metric tons for hot rolled steel in 
2003, the department said.

	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Media General Inc. reported a 24 percent  
decrease in profits for the second quarter, a drop it blamed 
largely on lower revenues in its newsprint production division. The 
Richmond-based media conglomerate reported today that earnings for 
the quarter ended June 27 were $16.5 million, or 61 cents per 
share, down from $21.5 million, or 80 cents per share, in the same 
period of last year. Despite the drop, the results were well above 
analyst expectations of 55 cents per share, according to First Call 
Corp. Revenues for the quarter also dropped. The company reported 
$199.6 million in revenues, down from $211.5 million for the second 
quarter of 1998.

for each of the 24,733 hours they worked, newly released documents 
show. The state attorney general's office released the information 
yesterday in an attempt to end an open records lawsuit filed by 
three newspapers seeking to learn details on work the firms 
performed in winning the state a $5.9 billion settlement with 
cigarette makers. The hundreds of pages detail such activities as 
hundreds of hours spent reviewing thousands of previously secret

attract investment, investment pays for research and research leads 
to the new cures and treatments that will help and heal patients,''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Pension Change Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Employers would be required to give  
workers at least 45 days notice for pension plan changes that could 
reduce their benefits, under a bill proposed by President Clinton 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too many workers are left in the dark when their pension plans  
change,'' Clinton said in a written statement during a visit for a 
speech to the Communications Workers of America and a fund-raising 
dinner. ``Every worker deserves meaningful and timely information 
about changes to their retirement benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is aimed primarily at alerting workers to a new  
kind of pension program called a ``cash balance'' plan, which is 
increasingly popular among big firms, such as Bell Atlantic, Bank 
of America, Chase Manhattan and the International Business Machines 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM said earlier this year it would save $200 million annually  
by switching its 141,000 U.S. employees to a cash balance program, 
in which pension benefits accumulate uniformly each year rather 
than growing slowly at the start of a worker's employment and 
accelerating as retirement approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash balance plans typically are advantageous to younger  
employees who do not stay with a company long enough to get the 
benefits of a traditional pension program whose pay-out is 
calculated to a combination of age and service. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-term employees could wind up with fewer benefits in a cash  
balance plan than their traditional plan.

<HEADLINE> All-Stars Feast on Home Cooking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Pete Rose running over Ray Fosse to score the  
winning run at Riverfront Stadium. Ted Williams hitting two homers 
at Fenway Park. Carl Hubbell striking out five straight future Hall 
of Famers at the Polo Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to hometown heroes, the All-Star game has produced  
more than its share. 
</P>
<P>
	Be it Hank Aaron homering in Atlanta, Sandy Alomar earning the  
MVP award in Cleveland or Johnny Vander Meer winning at old Crosley 
Field, the local star often highlights the show. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Pedro Martinez, Nomar Garciaparra and Jose Offerman  
got their chance in Boston on Tuesday night. And just like all the 
rest, they had cheering fans and comfortable surroundings on their 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra was greeted by a standing ovation from the Fenway  
faithful during Monday night's home run derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unbelievable, it really is, going up there,'' the Red  
Sox shortstop said. ``I was nervous, without a doubt, but it's also 
kind of a nice, warm feeling when you just hear the crowd behind 
you like that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure you saw my face with a smile from ear to ear, and it  
still hasn't left. It was just something special,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he was just watching the sluggers swing away, Martinez  
drew an equally enthusiastic response. The packed crowd began 
chanting ``Pe-dro! Pe-dro!'' when he was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez was to get an early chance to make his mark Tuesday  
night. Starting for the AL, he was to face an imposing heart of the 
NL batting order -- Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, Matt Williams, Jeff 
Bagwell and Mike Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez looked forward to pitching to Sosa, a fellow star from  
the Dominican Republic. He figured Dominican fans would also enjoy 
the matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to be really confused because they love me as  
much as they love Sammy,'' he said. ``I think it's going to be a 
lot of fun for them to see us play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell pitched his way into All-Star history in 1934, the  
second year the game was played. Starting in his own park, the New 
York Giants ace used his famed screwball to strike out Babe Ruth, 
Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons and Joe Cronin in succession. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in 1938, Vander Meer, best known for becoming the only  
pitcher to throw consecutive no-hitters, tossed three scoreless 
innings to get the victory in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	In later years, the hitters took over at home. Joe DiMaggio  
homered at Yankee Stadium in 1939, Stan Musial connected at 
Sportsman's Park in St. Louis in 1948 and Al Rosen homered twice at 
Municipal Stadium in Cleveland in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar's go-ahead home run in the seventh inning at Jacobs Field  
in 1997 made him the only hometown player to win All-Star MVP 
award. Then again, the honor was not presented until 1962, too late 
for either Williams -- who went 4-for-4 with five RBIs in 1946 -- or 
Rosen to get it. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron (1972), Frank Howard (1969), Harmon Killebrew (1965) and  
Junior Gilliam (1959) also homered at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose made perhaps the most famous play in All-Star history when  
he crashed into Fosse to score the winning run in the 12th inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, several pitchers have fared well in their own parks,  
with Jerry Reuss winning at Dodger Stadium in 1980 and Jimmy Key 
getting the victory at SkyDome in Toronto in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The last All-Star starter to win in his home park, however, was  
Montreal's Steve Rogers at Olympic Stadium in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, Garciaparra and Offerman, a reserve infielder, hoped  
to help the AL narrow the NL's 40-28-1 lead Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what to expect,'' Garciaparra said. ``I kind of  
go out there and just take it all as it comes. But I tell you what 
-- me smiling, it will still be there tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> Selig Won't Reinstate Pete Rose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- With nearly two dozen Hall of Famers sitting  
beside him, Bud Selig said Tuesday that, as long he's commissioner, 
Pete Rose can pretty much forget about reinstatement to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The occasion was the launch of voting for baseball's All-Century  
team. While Rose is among the 100 players on the ballot, he wasn't 
invited to the news conference before Tuesday night's All-Star game 
and won't be asked to any ceremonies if he's among the winners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's anything I would do to change what Bart  
Giamatti did,'' Selig said, referring to the former commissioner 
who kicked Rose out of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the lifetime ban he signed with Giamatti in August  
1989, Rose is ineligible for the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was in Boston to make a corporate appearance for two hours  
Tuesday night. Rose declined comment when Selig's statements were 
relayed through his business agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same old thing, business as usual,'' said agent  
Warren Greene, who was with Rose in Boston. ``Right now, I don't 
think Pete wants to start trading any barbs or make any comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose applied for reinstatement in September 1997, but Selig  
hasn't announced a decision. From his statements Tuesday, it's 
clear the only two options Selig is considering are rejection or 
never acting on the petition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without question, Pete Rose in one of the top players in the  
century,'' Hall of Famer third baseman Mike Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
	That said, Schmidt agreed with those who claim Rose hasn't  
reconfigured his life in the past decade. While no formal finding 
was made, Giamatti said he was convinced Rose bet on the Cincinnati 
Reds while he was managing the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly believe the ball's in Pete's hands,'' Schmidt said.  
``Pete needs to take some serious steps in his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 100 players on the ballot, 85 are in the Hall of Fame.  
The exceptions include eight active players: Barry Bonds, Roger 
Clemens, Ken Griffey Jr., Tony Gwynn, Rickey Henderson, Greg 
Maddux, Mark McGwire and Cal Ripken. Also not in the Hall are 
recent retirees Dennis Eckersley, Paul Molitor, Eddie Murray and 
Ozzie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other three are Carlton Fisk, who fell 43 votes short  
of the hall this year; Shoeless Joe Jackson, who was bypassed by 
the baseball writers and the veterans committee before the 
prohibition against banned players took effect in 1991; and Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was among eight Chicago White Sox players banned for  
throwing the 1919 World Series, and there's been a campaign to 
reinstate him, too. Selig said he expects to make a decision on 
Jackson's case later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Rose and Jackson were featured in a lengthy video  
presentation during the new conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're two players who made an impact on the field,'' Selig  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-nine of the 54 living players on the ballot attended the  
news conference, including 22 Hall of Famers, among them Hank 
Aaron, Willie Mays and Stan Musial. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans can vote for two players at each infield position, two  
catchers, nine outfielders and six pitchers, and a committee can 
select up to five additional players to make up for any imbalance 
slighting the early part of the century, bringing the total to 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Much like All-Star balloting, fans can vote at ballparks and on  
the Internet. The promotion is sponsored by MasterCard 
International, which will put ballots in Sports Illustrated, TV 
Guide and Kmart stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Balloting runs through Sept. 10 and the team will be announced  
before Game 1 of the World Series. A panel selected by baseball 
will pick and All-Century starting lineup from the team.

<HEADLINE> Elway Signs As Spokesman for Coors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- Coors Brewing Co. is hoping John Elway can  
lead another comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, who retired in April after 16 seasons with the Denver  
Broncos, is part of a campaign to revive lagging sales of Original 
Coors, the brewer's flagship brand. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of 30-second television ads featuring Elway and ESPN  
broadcaster Dan Patrick were set to debut Tuesday night during the 
major league All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a striking appropriateness between what John Elway  
represents as a human being and the character of the Original Coors 
brand,'' said senior vice president of marketing Bill Weintraub. 
``Each of them has a sense of values that's almost a mystique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its title as the flagship brand, Original Coors amounts  
to less than 10 percent of total sales for the brewery. Coors Light 
accounts for 70 percent of sales, according to Beer Marketer's 
Insights, a trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
	While sales of Coors Light increased 4 percent from 1997 to  
1998, Original Coors fell 5 percent, Beer Marketer reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The TV spots feature Patrick speaking from the bleachers of Mile  
High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``He once scored 21 points in under two minutes,'' Patrick says.  
``He'll forever be known for a 15-play, last-scond drive to win a 
championship. You expected him to come from behind every once in a 
while. You just didn't expect him to do it 47 times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ad ends with Elway sitting outdoors wearing a denim shirt.  
He smiles for the camera and twists the cap off a bottle of Coors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Original Coors,'' he says. ``What'd you expect me to drink?''  
</P>
<P>
	Elway and Coors have discussed a marketing deal over the years,  
but beer industry guidelines prohibit brewers from using 
professional athletes until they retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway's spokesman Jeff Sperbeck said the future Hall of Fame  
quarterback decided to join Coors after meeting company CEO Peter 
Coors and president Leo Kieley III.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will discuss gun control  
measures with high school students from Littleton, Colo., and the 
Denver area before they travel to Capitol Hill this week to lobby 
Congress for such measures.

late April by teen gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who then 
turned the guns on themselves. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> GOP Presidental Field Shrinks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The crowded field of Republican presidential  
hopefuls began to dwindle Tuesday as Ohio Rep. John Kasich firmed 
up plans to drop out of the race and New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith 
left the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
Kasich would quit the campaign on Wednesday with words of support 
for Texas Gov. George Bush, and that the Republican front-runner 
would be present to receive the endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich's planned exit, scripted to underscore his commitment to  
the GOP, couldn't have been more different than Smith's. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-term senator was defiant in a floor speech that  
sharply attacked the pollsters and consultants whom he said reigned 
supreme. ``I want my party to stand for something,'' the 
conservative lawmaker said, adding that Republicans routinely 
ignored their own party platform on issues as diverse as abortion, 
foreign policy and gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	As for his presidential hopes, Smith told reporters he had been  
in touch with the U.S. Taxpayers party and might run for president 
as its candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	While their leave-taking differed greatly in style, Kasich and  
Smith had found themselves in similar predicaments in the GOP 
presidential competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were mired in single digits in the nationwide public  
opinion polls -- Smith at 1 percent and Kasich at 3 percent. Both 
suffered from lagging fund raising that made the likelihood of 
political competitiveness increasingly remote, and left them unable 
even to join the tier of contenders closest to Bush. If anything, 
their situation worsened two weeks ago when Bush announced he had 
raised a record $36 million in the first six months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith also faced the prospect of faring poorly in his home-state  
primary in New Hampshire. He had failed to draw the support of any 
of the other members of his state's congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign aides to Kasich declined comment on his plans.  
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old Ohio lawmaker had created a presidential  
exploratory committee and traveled the country energetically for 
months, with multiple trips to key states such as Iowa and New 
Hampshire. He also was willing to take potentially unpopular 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
	In one speech, he observed that eliminating government subsidies  
for business could finance a tax cut. In another, he outlined a 
proposal for Social Security under which baby boomers would accept 
smaller benefit checks in exchange for being allowed to divert part 
of their payroll taxes to potentially more lucrative but also 
riskier stock market accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
Kasich planned to say he does not intend to seek re-election to the 
House after his current term expires in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP rules impose a term limit on his tenure as chairman of  
the Budget Committee, and he must surrender that post at the end of 
his term. In nearly five years in the post, he has helped craft a 
series of spending cuts and was deeply involved in negotiations 
that led to passage of the balanced budget agreement of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	'' John is a good Republican, a fine candidate and he campaigned  
well for his vision of America. He's a good man and I wish him 
success,'' said Elizabeth Dole, another GOP presidential contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's departure poses a potential threat to the GOP's  
presidential hopes, however, particularly if he is followed out of 
the party by others trying to rally the Republicans to a more 
uncompromising set of conservative principles. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, a former Reagan aide running as a conservative,  
issued a statement that he had no intention of leaving the 
Republican Party. He urged Smith's supporters ``to continue their 
fight for the ideas we share by joining my campaign for the 
Republican nomination for president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Pat Buchanan, a third-time contender for the GOP nomination,  
issued a statement that contained no such urging. ``When a man as 
conservative and principles as Bob Smith walks away from the 
Republican Party, perhaps the problem is not with Sen. Smith, but 
with the Republican establishment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 58, has a strongly conservative voting record, and is one  
of the Senate's most consistent opponents of abortion. Recently, he 
has used his senatorial prerogative to slow efforts to write a 
final gun control compromise between the House and the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won the revolution on issues. We won the revolution on  
principle,'' he said in a Senate speech that retraced Ronald 
Reagan's rise to power and the GOP takeover of the House and Senate 
in 1994. ``But the desire to stay in power caused us to start 
listening to the pollsters and the consultants again, who were 
telling us for some inexplicable reason that we need to walk away 
from issues...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's GOP colleagues in the Senate reacted gingerly to his  
decision to quit the party and become an independent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that he's doing this out of conviction,'' said Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said Smith had indicated that he still would like to be  
included in Republican caucus meetings and decisions. He said 
senators would discuss whether Smith should remain chairman of the 
ethics committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, chairman of the GOP senatorial  
campaign committee, said, ``Bob Smith has been a solid Republican 
... he ought to be treated as a member of the team.''

<HEADLINE> House Congratulates U.S. Soccer Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fever over the U.S. women's soccer team  
spread to Congress today. One female House member said the World 
Cup victory over China was ``an American dream come true.'' Another 
brought a soccer ball to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	And House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has invited the  
champions to visit Washington for a ``national pep rally'' at the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team won the championship 5-4 Saturday on penalty kicks  
after a scoreless tie through 120 minutes of play at the Rose Bowl 
in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	A nonbinding ``sense of the House'' resolution that passed by  
voice vote congratulates the team for raising the ``level of 
awareness and appreciation for women's sports'' nationwide and for 
becoming ``positive role models for American youth aspiring to 
participate in national and international level sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To illustrate the point, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., brought a  
soccer ball to the House chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we saw was an American dream come true,'' said Republican  
Rep. Judy Biggert of Illinois. She said little boys, for 
generations, could grow up wishing to emulate their athletic role 
models while girls had no one to idolize. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now little girls have the dream,'' Biggert said.

<HEADLINE> Term-Limit Champion Mum on Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Tillie Fowler decried career  
politicians when she ran for Congress in 1992, vowing to serve no 
more than eight years if she won. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven years later, the top-ranking Republican woman in the House  
and one of its most influential leaders is facing the dilemma of 
whether to run again and risk the label of promise-breaker. 
</P>
<P>
	She will be the last to decide among 10 current House members  
who imposed term limits on themselves in 1992 and 1994; six have 
said they will not run again and three plan to seek another term. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fowler, 56, has been reluctant to talk about her term-limit  
pledge, calling it a ``non-issue.'' She also said she won't 
announce whether she will seek reelection until the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not do so until I have the opportunity to learn about  
my leadership role and discuss the issue with my constituents,'' 
she said in a brief interview recently. 
</P>
<P>
	She referred other questions about her future to a letter she  
wrote to the Times-Union in Jacksonville last December. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bedrock of the commitment I made in 1992 is that I have no  
intention of being a career congressperson. Serving one additional 
term will not change that,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Term-limit supporters upset that she might break her pledge have  
panned Ms. Fowler while supporters think she should remain in 
Washington to wield her increasing political clout. 
</P>
<P>
	Her indecisiveness prompted a Florida Times-Union columnist to  
dub her ``Slick Tillie,'' a much different moniker than the ``Steel 
Magnolia'' nickname she has for her sweet Southern demeanor and her 
persistent -- some say stubborn -- personality. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fowler, who represents a majority Republican district in  
northeast Florida, is vice chairman of the Republican Conference, 
which includes all 223 GOP members of Congress. She ranks fifth in 
the House Republican hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
	She recently filed paperwork to run for reelection. She said she  
was required to do so because she had received contributions and 
that it had nothing to do with whether she would run again. Her 
campaign already has collected $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fowler has run unopposed in the last three elections, and  
Democrats hope to line up a viable candidate if she runs again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole basis for electing her was that she serve only eight  
years,'' said Tony Welch, a spokesman for the state Democratic 
Party. ``What is she going to say? Excuse me for lying to you eight 
years ago?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fowler's colleagues who won't seek reelection are Reps. Jack  
Metcalf, R-Wash.; Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho; Matt Salmon, R-Ariz.; 
Mark Sanford, R-S.C.; Charles Canady, R-Fla.; and Tom Coburn, 
R-Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Three who changed their minds and will seek reelection are Reps.  
George Nethercutt, R-Wash., Marty Meehan, D-Mass., and Scott 
McInnis, R-Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville Mayor John Delaney, a Republican, would like Ms.  
Fowler to join the latter group, saying her leadership position 
will be good for the city and its two Navy bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a selfish point of view, I hope she abandons her four  
term-limit pledge,'' Delaney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Wilson, a Republican retiree, has voted for Ms. Fowler and  
thinks she has done a good job. But he wants her to call it quits. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of them ought to stick to their pledges,'' he said.  
``Fresh blood is a good thing.''

<HEADLINE> Olazabal To Play With Broken Hand  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Still in pain and with a wrap on his  
right hand, Jose Maria Olazabal says he's fit enough to play the 
opening round of the British Open on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't go near him if he plays another bad round.  
</P>
<P>
	The Masters champ broke his hand when he punched the wall of his  
hotel room in frustration after a first-round 75 at the U.S. Open 
three weeks ago. He didn't play another round until Monday's 
practice at Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hand it all right. It's recovering OK,'' the Spaniard said  
after completing 18 holes around one of the toughest courses in 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It still hurts a little bit, but it will take at least 2-3  
weeks to be truly free of pain. Because of the fracture being so 
clean, it is OK. It shouldn't get worse. It's just a matter of time 
before healing properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal, out of action for 18 months with severe foot problems  
before his amazing recovery ended with a second Masters triumph 
this year, knows how to play in pain. 
</P>
<P>
	But he acknowledged his foolishness in putting himself out of  
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had some problems with my feet, now I have a broken bone in  
my hand,'' he said. ``So the only part of my body that I think will 
handle that kind of punch will be my head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I did pretty well holding my emotions on the golf  
course and on the driving range and on the putting green. I was 
just on my own in the room and I could express myself freely at 
that time. That's why it happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniard admits he will be handicapped if he has to play out  
of the thick rough that borders virtually every hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot grip the club properly because I cannot use any  
strength with my fifth finger,'' Olazabal said. ``So that's the 
reason why it is affecting my swing more than anything else. It's 
not that it hurts when I strike the ball. It's just that I cannot 
grip the club properly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to affect my chances. I'm here to try the best I  
can. It is the British Open. I love this tournament in a very 
special way. I will do whatever is needed to play this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is nice to be here even though I know that my chances are  
not all that great.''

<HEADLINE> Murder Suspect Mistakenly Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- A man accused of killing his girlfriend by  
stabbing her more than 100 times was mistakenly set free because of 
a paperwork error, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen C. Brown was released July 6, but the error wasn't  
discovered until Monday, when he was scheduled for arraignment. He 
was still at large today. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 37, was indicted on July 2 on a charge of first-degree  
murder in the May 22 death of Carol Buvik-Arnold, 37. The Pima 
County Jail apparently didn't receive notice of the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's Capt. Paul Wilson said the jail did receive notice of  
an earlier Justice Court complaint and arrest warrant against Brown 
that were dismissed, so he was released. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really isn't our place to question why that was the case,''  
Wilson said. ``The court sent us a document saying the charges were 
invalid, and we acted on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, prosecutor Barbara LaWall said the document clearly  
stated that the earlier complaint and warrant were superseded by 
the July 2 indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that could have been done was, before you  
release someone on first-degree murder charges, is to verify 
whether or not they are supposed to be released,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patti Noland, Superior Court clerk, said it's unclear what  
happened to a copy of the indictment that was placed in the 
sheriff's basket at the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	LaWall apologized, saying ``we're all very deeply concerned,''  
but said her office, the sheriff's office and the court ``are all 
operating short-staffed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mistaken release is the jail's fourth in the past 16 months.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Adds Toys, Electronics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com's online superstore will get even  
bigger today as the Internet retailing powerhouse adds thousands of 
toys and electronics to its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based company announced today that it has started to  
sell everything from Barbie dolls and Pokemon trading cards to DVD 
players and electronic organizers on its site. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the latest move by Amazon.com to become a massive online  
shopping hub, where consumers can find a vast array of merchandise 
at the click of a mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's stock was up $4.62 1/2, or 4 percent, at $122 this  
morning on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doesn't everyone just hate shopping at big toy stores and  
electronics stores? It's miserable, so we are giving people a 
better and easier alternative,'' said Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com's 
founder and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	While Amazon.com has yet to turn a profit in its four years in  
business, the company hasn't stopped spending money to make itself 
into a more diversified online retailer and expand its customer 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last 14 months, the company has gone from being  
exclusively an online bookseller into an Internet shopping hub 
offering music, videos, auctions and electronic greeting cards. It 
now has more than 10 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com also has also invested millions of dollars in online  
pharmacy drugstore.com, Internet pet shop Pets.com, and 
cybersupermarket HomeGrocer.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com has been testing toys and electronics on its site  
since November, when it began selling a limited supply of both in 
its online gift shop. It closed the gift shop today. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's serious push into toys and electronics comes as  
analysts expect big growth in both areas. Internet research firm 
Jupiter Communications predicts online toy sales will rise from 
$52.6 million in 1999 to $550 million by 2002, while sales of 
consumer electronics on the Internet will grow from $78 million 
this year to $792 million in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	In its latest online foray, Amazon.com is working with more than  
320 toy manufacturers, including the mass-market giants such as 
Mattel and Hasbro and the smaller companies that usually only sell 
to specialty toy shops. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoppers will be able to browse the merchandise by age, category  
or price. They can also see the site's list of best-selling toys or 
those toys deemed best by outside toy experts. Comments and ratings 
from other customers also will be posted. 
</P>
<P>
	And the toy store isn't just for kids. A ``Toys for Grownups''  
area includes office toys, retro classics and party games. 
</P>
<P>
	With its toy store, Amazon.com moves into a market now dominated  
by eToys, which has been online since 1997 and has become an 
Internet superstore for kids. Amazon.com will also come up against 
Toys R Us, the huge traditional retailer that has struggled to find 
its way on the Internet but now is the process of building up its 
online arm -- toysrus.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The new electronics store will feature gadgets and appliances  
from top manufacturers, including 3Com, Sharp and Panasonic. 
</P>
<P>
	A buying guide to Amazon.com's electronics offerings includes  
detailed information on all its products composed by an in-house 
staff as well as reviews by fellow consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also in-depth technical data on the products, pictures  
of goods and thorough lists of frequently asked questions, such as 
warranty policies and customer service questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many of its brick-and-mortar competitors, Amazon.com will  
offer a 30-day, money back guarantee and will not charge a 
restocking fee for items that have been open. Many retailers make 
shoppers pay up to 15 percent of the purchase price if they try to 
return an item that has been opened.

<HEADLINE> VA Supervisor Sentenced for Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A former Veterans Affairs supervisor has been  
sentenced to 33 months in federal prison and two years probation 
for stealing $615,000 in disability benefit money. 
</P>
<P>
	Joy Cheri Brown, who was sentenced yesterday, will be permitted  
to remain free until her prison assignment is determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown had worked at the Veterans Service Center at Bay Pines in  
Pinellas County. She was arrested in January and charged with 
making false disability claims in the name of her fiance, a police 
officer who was unaware of the scam. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes good people make wrong decisions,'' Brown said prior  
to her sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	She pleaded guilty March 9 and agreed to forfeit $339,000 in  
property and pay $615,472 in restitution, said executive Assistant 
U.S. Attorney Monte Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	VA Inspector General Richard Griffin cited the Brown case last  
month as an example of a flawed system in which the same workers 
who process claims also authorize payments. A copy of Griffin's 
report was obtained Monday by The Associated Press.

	Senate Rejects First HMO Amendment  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats trying to expand a GOP patients'  
rights bill lost the opening vote today as the Senate rejected 
their effort to allow women more HMO options in choosing doctors 
and hospitals. The vote was 52-48, mostly along party lines. The 
amendment, the first in a series of votes this week, would have 
allowed women to designate obstetrician-gynecologists as their 
primary care doctors. It also would have made sure that a woman 
could stay overnight in a hospital after a mastectomy if her doctor 
recommended it.

	Alleged Railway Killer In Custody  
</P>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, the Mexican  
drifter suspected of killing eight people as he made his way around 
the country hopping freight trains, turned himself in today under 
an agreement that assures family visits, a psychological evaluation 
and promises that he would be safe in jail, said Bruce Casteel, 
commander of the Texas Rangers. The agreement does not shield 
Resendez-Ramirez from the death penalty, Casteel said. The tattoed 
ex-convict -- who is charged with three murders and linked to five 
other slayings, all of them in Texas, Kentucky and Illinois -- was 
on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List.

	MIAMI (AP) -- The airline maintenance company that packed up the  
oxygen canisters blamed for the 1996 ValuJet crash that killed 110 
people in the Everglades was charged with murder and manslaughter 
by state prosecutors today. Hours later, a federal grand jury 
indicted the company, SabreTech Inc., two of its mechanics and a 
maintenance director, alleging conspiracy, making false statements 
and, in the case of SabreTech, failing to properly train the 
personnel who handled hazardous material. A cargo fire virtually 
obliterated the aircraft and killed all 105 passengers and five 
crew members shortly after takeoff on May 11, 1996.

	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Tensions between reformers  
and hard-liners erupted into a sixth straight day of protests in 
the Iranian capital today. Riot police lobbed tear gas at thousands 
of activists, and gangs of hard-line vigilantes roamed Tehran with 
batons, trying to stave off more demonstrations. Shops and banks 
closed and pedestrians fled downtown as Iran faced its most raucous 
week since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Since Thursday, two people 
have been killed in pro-democracy protests.

	U.S. Urges China, Taiwan To Meet  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With China warning Taiwan it was ``playing  
with fire'' by hinting at independence, the State Department 
criticized both sides and urged them to hold ``meaningful 
substantive talks.'' In the meantime, American diplomats will meet 
in Taipei tomorrow with senior Taiwanese officials, spokesman James 
P. Rubin said. ``We're concerned that it is not helpful for the 
Taiwanese authorities to make statements that would make it harder 
to have dialogue,'' Rubin said today. Meanwhile, China intensified 
its attacks on Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui, saying he was 
pursuing independence for the island.

<HEADLINE> Bausch &AMP; Lomb Is Selling to Amplifon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc. is selling its Miracle  
Ear hearing aid business to Amplifon SpA of Italy for an 
undisclosed sum as it looks to focus on eye care. 
</P>
<P>
	Bausch &AMP; Lomb will lose $17 million before taxes from the  
Miracle Ear sale, spokeswoman Holly Houston said Monday. Helping to 
offset the loss will be the $120 million profit from its recent 
sale of its sunglasses business to Luxottica Group SpA, Houston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miracle Ear, headquartered in Golden Valley, Minn., makes and  
sells hearing aids and related products through more than 1,000 
franchises and company locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Amplifon, a privately held company, is the leading distributor  
and retailer of hearing aids in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Bausch &AMP; Lomb has been refocusing in recent years on eye care --  
contact lenses, ophthalmic drugs, eye surgery instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the divestiture of our hearing aid product line, we are  
close to completing our exit from those non-core businesses which 
do not leverage our heritage, brand name and technological 
competencies in the eye care field,'' said William M. Carpenter, 
chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bausch &AMP; Lomb hopes to sell by the end of the year its last  
non-core subsidiary, Charles River Laboratories, which breeds 
animals for medical research, Houston said.

<HEADLINE> Old-Fashioned Pensions Disappearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For years, the old-fashioned pension plan served corporate  
America well, luring generations of lifetime employees to offices, 
factories and retail stores, and rewarding their loyalty with the 
promise they'd be cared for in retirement. The longer they stayed, 
the more they got. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, that traditional plan, called the defined benefit plan,  
itself is being put out to pasture -- and rather unceremoniously, 
some workers believe. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing number of companies are ditching the old plan -- which  
upon retirement provides a fixed monthly income based on length of 
service -- and converting to what's known as a cash balance plan. 
The newer plans have been around since the mid-1980s, but it's only 
in recent years that an increasing number of companies have 
switched to them. 
</P>
<P>
	In the world of benefits, there is the defined benefit plan,  
which stays with the employer until the account is accessed after 
retirement; a defined contribution plan such as a 401(k), which the 
employee can take with when he moves to a new job, and the cash 
balance plan -- a hybrid combining some features of both. 
</P>
<P>
	With the cash balance, employers contribute annually to each  
``account'' based on a set percentage of pay for all participants 
and each employee's holdings usually accrue the same rate of 
interest. Employees watch their accounts grow in value just as they 
do with 401(k)s, and they can take them with them when they leave. 
But like traditional pension plans, the company decides how the 
money is invested since the assets are pooled. In a 401(k) plan, 
the employee directs his own investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on who you talk to, cash balance plans are either a  
revolutionary new employee benefit or a big corporate rip-off. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies say the plans are necessary to recruit younger workers  
in a highly competitive job market. They deliver benefits more 
equitably to a changing workforce, and in a way employees can 
better understand and appreciate, they say. Today's mobile workers 
would get a mere pittance under the old plan, in which the bulk of 
a worker's benefits are earned in the last years before retirement, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumer groups and many longer-term employees argue the  
cash-balance- conversion is simply an unobtrusive way for big 
business to cut retirement costs and pocket the savings. In fact, 
some older workers are finding that after the conversion, their 
retirement benefits are far less than they had counted on under the 
old plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about billions of dollar for millions of  
employees,'' said William K. Carr, a Denver lawyer representing 
employees in some class action lawsuits against companies who have 
made a conversion, 
</P>
<P>
	``All of them (cash balance plans) in my opinion violate the age  
discriminate law. They provide a lower rate of benefit accrual for 
older workers,'' Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many employers involved in pension conversion -- and roughly 20  
percent of Fortune 500 companies now have cash balance accounts -- 
concede some of their employees may be hurt by the change. Most, 
though, have transition plans in place to protect those closest to 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Employers are very concerned about that issue and are  
attempting to 'grandfather' older, longer-service employees into 
the old plans so they do not have the loss of benefits,'' said Tom 
Schlossberg, chief executive officer of Diversified Investment 
Advisers of Purchase, N.Y., a benefits consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies allow workers within seven to five years of  
retirement or over age 55 to stay in the old plan. Others 
automatically put employees with a certain number of years of 
service in the plan that pays out the most. Still others have 
credited the accounts of longer-term employees with a higher 
percentage of salary. 
</P>
<P>
	David Lovelace, a 52-year-old project manager for IBM Corp. in  
San Jose, Calif., made the transition cutoff after IBM's July 1 
conversion. He's within five years of qualifying for earliest 
retirement at age 55, and therefore, eligible to stay in the old 
retirement plan if he chooses. And he does. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one in their right mind would go to the new plan,'' if they  
didn't have to, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His colleague, Nancy Goodenough, a software marketing manager  
and an 18-year veteran, had no choice. She missed the age cutoff by 
a year, and says she loses 43 percent of her accrued benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The amount I would get if I separated from the company on July  
1 was $700 per month (upon retirement),'' she said. ``With the new 
plan, I'm starting out with $400 a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She and other affected workers interviewed say they feel  
betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was ... so happy that I had the security and the sense of  
family at IBM. You were basically taken care, and I think that 
that's the sense of loss that we feel,'' Goodenough said. ``When 
they talked about Social Security going away, I used to say, 'I'll 
always have my IBM pension'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 50,000 IBM employees are in that vulnerable  
middle-career category, 30,000 are near retirement and another 
50,000 are early career, according to company spokeswoman Jana 
Weatherbee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It (the conversion) will mean different things to different  
people,'' she conceded. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to attract the industry's best talent so we had to  
make a change,'' she explained. ``We still have a significant 
benefit and pension plan (which includes both a pension and 
401(k)). Most of our competition doesn't even offer pension 
plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, IBM has said it will save $200 million annually by  
switching its 141,000 U.S. employees to a cash balance program. 
</P>
<P>
	Defined contribution arrangements now account for 60 percent of  
all employer-sponsored retirement plans, according to a study 
released last year by New York benefits consultant William M. 
Mercer. Mercer predicts that figure will grow to 70 percent by the 
year 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 401(k), employees contribute from their own paychecks;  
employers will often match a percentage of that contribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers like Sang J. Moon, 31, who has spent two years as a  
software developer for IBM in Bethesda, Md., have much to gain by a 
cash-balance conversion. A job-hopper through his high-tech career, 
he likes the idea of having a growing pension he can take with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt I'll spend 30 to 35 years with IBM,'' said Moon, who  
despite his short tenure, started an Internet Web site for IBM 
employees looking to vent their frustrations about the pension 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging the frustrations of some workers adversely  
impacted by pension conversion, David Rosenblum, a Mercer 
principal, points out that no one is actually having money taken 
out of their pockets. ``We're talking about future earnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All pension plans are voluntary, he noted, and companies have  
the right to make appropriate changes to their business plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a voluntary pension system and employers can do anything  
they please,'' agreed Carr, the attorney. But he says many 
companies have done a poor job communicating the pension changes to 
their work force. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want employees to know how much they're being paid so they  
can make a decision to stay with an employer or go someplace 
else,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton this week proposed a bill that would require  
employers to give workers at least 45 days notice for pension plan 
changes that could reduce their benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill sponsored by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., would  
require companies to tell employees how the changeover to a cash 
balance plan would affect them and give each a personal statement 
comparing benefits under the old and new plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people don't realize what their pensions are,'' said  
Karen Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights Center in 
Washington, a consumer group supporting the disclosure bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this is employee's money,'' she said. ``It was a  
recognition ... that the only realistic way of supplementing Social 
Security for workers who would not save for themselves was through 
this form of corporate paternalism. That's why they stayed at their 
companies. Suddenly the rules of the game are being changed.''

<HEADLINE>  Credit Suisse Faces Losing License </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Financial Supervisory Agency has decided to  
recommend revoking the banking license of a unit of Credit Suisse 
Group AG because it allegedly tried to block an investigation of 
its handling of derivatives products, according to reports Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Credit Suisse Group in Tokyo refused to  
comment on the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese media said the FSA, which supervises financial markets,  
will seek the revocation of the license of Credit Suisse Financial 
Products, invoking Japan's banking law. 
</P>
<P>
	The FSA formally notified Japanese units of Credit Suisse of the  
findings of its investigation on Tuesday, Hideichiro Hamanaka, 
deputy head of the FSA, said at a news conference. But Hamanaka and 
other FSA officials refused to comment on the report's content. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial watchdog also turned over its report to the  
Financial Reconstruction Commission, which oversees the FSA and has 
the power to revoke the licenses of financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Suisse will have the opportunity at a hearing to respond  
to the findings, the media reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Supervisory Agency has concluded that Credit  
Suisse Financial Products attempted to obstruct an examination 
launched by the watchdog agency on Jan. 20 by destroying documents 
and shipping others off to London, the media reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FSA also believes that Credit Suisse Group violated  
regulations separating banking and securities operations, the 
reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	The almost six-month investigation also covered three other  
group companies: Credit Suisse First Boston Tokyo branch, Credit 
Suisse Trust and Banking Co. and Credit Suisse First Boston 
Securities Japan Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Ahead in Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SESTRIERES, Italy (AP) -- Battling fierce rain and wind, Lance  
Armstrong looked at the steep climb and feared it might not be his 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	But then he glanced at his rivals, who were clearly tiring on  
the Col du Galibier mountain pass, and he summoned a burst of 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, making an astonishing recovery from testicular  
cancer, won the ninth stage of the Tour de France on Tuesday and 
tightened his grip on cycling's showcase race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to show you're strong in the mountains,'' he  
said. ``I'm surprised with the way I felt today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he insists the race is far from over.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can have bad days and my condition can run out,'' he said.  
``We have to continue to be aware and smart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the race's first mountain stage, the Texan showed he is the  
man to beat. Not known as a top climber, he persevered on the 
punishing, rain-slicked slopes of the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory in the 133-mile stage was Armstrong's third of the  
race, following the prologue and Sunday's time trial. He leads the 
field by 6 minutes, 3 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	His performance is all the more remarkable considering his  
cancer once spread to his lungs and brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable what he's doing,'' American great Greg  
LeMond, a three-time Tour winner, said Tuesday. ``I think he's even 
better than before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race began in sunshine at the French ski resort of Le Grand  
Bornand. The riders rapidly descended through lush valleys dotted 
with chalets and mountain rapids. 
</P>
<P>
	But as they approached the first major climb to the Col du  
Telegraphe, heavy rain began lashing, and the stage became an even 
greater test of endurance. 
</P>
<P>
	There, Armstrong was aided by teammates Tyler Hamilton and Kevin  
Livingston, who nursed him uphill in their slipstream. Content at 
that point to sit back, he was 12th to arrive at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the tortuous climb to the jagged, snow-capped peaks of  
the Col du Galibier. On the way up the hairpin turns, Armstrong 
tired. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weather was brutal. It was very cold on top of the  
Galibier,'' he said. ``I didn't feel super there, but then I 
realized from the look on the others' faces that they were 
suffering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So he plowed on, edging ahead of the pack and arriving fifth at  
the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain soon stopped, and after a rapid, dry descent, Armstrong  
got stronger. With about 6 miles to go, he sprinted away from the 
leading pack of seven riders. Crossing the finish line, he held his 
arms aloft and looked to the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always ride well in these cold and wet conditions,'' he  
said. ``On a day like this, the competition is reduced by 50 
percent due to morale and crashes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In second place was Switzerland's Alex Zulle, 31 seconds off the  
pace, followed by Fernando Escartin of Spain, 1:26 behind. 
</P>
<P>
	French cyclist Richard Virenque, whom organizers tried to ban  
because he is being investigated in a drug scandal, came in sixth. 
But he took the dotted King of the Mountains jersey after picking 
up points in the intermediate sprints. 
</P>
<P>
	Second in the overall standings is Spain's Abraham Olano.  
France's Christophe Moreau is third, 7:44 behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alps claimed eight victims Tuesday, all of them abandoning  
the race. Two of them were the sprint stars of the first week: 
Estonia's Jaan Kirsipuu and Italy's Mario Cipollini. 
</P>
<P>
	Cipollini, who made history by winning four consecutive stages  
in the first week, has never yet finished the Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirsipuu won the yellow jersey last Monday and kept it until  
Sunday, when Armstrong took over again.

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs To Acquire Hull Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has taken another step  
into electronic stock trading with the acquisition of the Hull 
Group for $531 million in stock, options and cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement Monday is the latest of several investments by  
Goldman Sachs this year in ventures that will challenge traditional 
stock markets like the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Hull Group, based in Chicago, is a leading market maker in  
stocks and stock derivatives worldwide. Market makers maintain firm 
bid and offer prices in a given security by standing ready to buy 
or sell shares at publicly quoted prices. Hull provides electronic 
market making and services on 28 exchanges in nine countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been looking at a lot of changes that have been  
affecting our various businesses,'' said Bob Steel, co-head of 
worldwide equities for Goldman Sachs. Goldman wants ``to enhance 
our skills in a way the marketplace is moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Goldman formed a partnership with Merrill Lynch &AMP;  
Co. and Madoff Securities to develop an electronic trading system. 
In January, Goldman and E-Trade Group Inc. bought a minority stake 
in another electronic trading system called Archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of Wall Street firms are scrambling to form alliances  
and secure the technology that is changing the way people buy and 
sell stocks around the world. They are also putting pressure on 
traditional stock markets to make monumental changes, like staying 
open longer and listing more foreign stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Salomon Smith Barney, for  
example, have linked up with Eclipse Trading, a new electronic 
trading company that will offer round-the-clock trading starting 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hull Group was founded in 1985 and today employs 250 people,  
including software developers, financial engineers, traders and 
support personnel. About two-thirds of its $103 million in revenues 
last year came from electronic trading. About 57 percent of 
revenues came from foreign exchanges, where countries rely more on 
electronic trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the company filed documents with the Securities and  
Exchange Commission to sell its stock to the public, but decided to 
sell itself to Goldman Sachs. 
</P>
<P>
	This is Goldman's first purchase as a public company. The  
130-year-old investment bank raised $3.66 billion in its public 
offering in May, and is now using its stock as a currency to 
further its growth strategy.

<HEADLINE> GOP Struggles Over Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While the Republican Congress struggles over  
relatively modest gun control measures, Democratic presidential 
rivals Al Gore and Bill Bradley are proposing far more stringent 
steps. And the NAACP is going to court to seek handgun 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	After a recess, the gun control issue is back.  
</P>
<P>
	Driven by the deadly outburst of school shootings last spring,  
the Senate passed a bill May 20 to tighten background checks for 
gun sales and require handgun safety locks. Republicans opposed to 
the gun restrictions stumbled over the issue before yielding to 
pressure to do something. Vice President Gore, in his capacity as 
president of the Senate, cast a tie-breaking vote for strengthened 
background checks on buyers at gun shows and pawnshops. People who 
buy guns from dealers already are subject to background checks, 
meant to keep guns away from people with records of crime, drug 
abuse or other patterns of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Republicans gained enough Democratic votes to ease  
the rules for gun-show sales. That led Democrats who wanted no less 
than the Senate had approved to vote against the whole business, on 
the ground that it would have weakened the current system. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun curbs were part of a bill aimed at controlling juvenile  
crime. It is now subject to negotiations between the Senate and 
House on their differing versions, which means bargaining over gun 
control provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	One question is how long to allow the government to check  
backgrounds of purchasers at gun shows for criminal records. The 
Senate bill provides three business days. The rejected House 
version was 24 hours, after which the buyer could get the gun 
unless that quick check turned up a disqualifying record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill also includes a requirement that safety devices  
to lock or store handguns be sold with them and bans the import of 
high-capacity ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step for Congress would be to choose negotiators for  
the Senate and House to work on a final compromise bill. There are 
obstacles even to that, including a filibuster threat from a 
Republican opposed to the gun bill the Senate passed. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders have promised a conference on the bills involved.  
Republicans will control it, so what it produces almost certainly 
will be short of what the White House and Democratic leaders 
advocate. 
</P>
<P>
	And Gore upped his aims on Monday, proposing photo ID licenses  
for people who buy handguns, and a ban on the cheap pistols called 
``Saturday night specials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, the former New Jersey senator challenging Gore for the  
Democratic presidential nomination, advocates those steps, plus 
registration of ``every one of the 65 million handguns in this 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he isn't opposed but thinks his proposal would be just  
as effective. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are too many political leaders who take their marching  
orders from the gun lobby,'' Gore said in a speech at the Boston 
Police Department. ``Let's create a family lobby that is greater 
and more powerful than the gun lobby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would take some doing, given the powerhouse lobbying of the  
National Rifle Association. The last major gun control bills were 
enacted in 1993 and 1994, when Democrats controlled Congress -- and 
the gun lobby mobilized against them in the elections in which the 
Republicans took over. 
</P>
<P>
	``If politics is the art of the possible, it's time to expand  
the possible,'' Bradley wrote in The Washington Post. Bradley said 
that as president he would stand up to the NRA and to ``the 
conventional wisdom about what is politically feasible to reduce 
gun deaths in our country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Gore:  
</P>
<P>
	``As president, I will do whatever it takes to get the guns away  
from children and criminals and to close every loophole in our law 
books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a president can't keep promises like those without a  
Congress to pass his proposals. That wouldn't happen with the 
current lineup or one close to it. The Republicans majority in the 
Senate is just 55-45, and it's shakier in the House at 223-211 and 
an independent who normally votes Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  
is filing suit for court-ordered gun controls to limit sales to 
licensed dealers and to keep people from buying more than one gun a 
month, arguing that black Americans are disproportionately affected 
by gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	That won't win new laws. But it is another way to raise the  
issue.

<HEADLINE> Cisneros Aides' Charges Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The independent counsel prosecuting former  
Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros has agreed to dismiss criminal 
charges against two former aides who were to stand trial with the 
one-time Clinton Cabinet member in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The action leaves Cisneros to stand trial alone on charges that  
he conspired with ex-mistress Linda Jones and the two aides to 
conceal during his Cabinet background check the scope of his 
financial payments to Ms. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Sylvia Arce-Garcia and John Rosales, who followed Cisneros from  
San Antonio to Washington when he became housing secretary, were 
indicted with Cisneros in December 1997 on charges they conspired 
to conceal details of the payments from FBI agents conducting 
Cisneros' Cabinet background check. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing Monday, prosecutors announced they will dismiss  
charges against Ms. Arce-Garcia and Rosales within six months after 
the Cisneros case is concluded provided that neither commits any 
crimes. Under the arrangement, the two admitted no wrongdoing and 
made no commitment to cooperate with the government's special 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, who is serving 3 1/2 years in prison after herself  
running afoul of Independent Counsel David Barrett, is cooperating 
with the government under a deal that could result in a sentence 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Ms. Arce-Garcia and Rosales welcomed prosecutors'  
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sylvia pled not guilty due to her strong belief that she  
should never have been charged,'' her lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said 
today. ``I am glad that the independent counsel has now seen fit to 
end this case against her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have now been involved in perhaps my fifth or sixth case  
brought by independent counsels that never would have been brought 
by experienced career prosecutors,'' Lowell added. ``The end of the 
independent counsel statute is a good thing for the American 
justice system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Gans, who represented Rosales, said he and his client  
were ``thrilled'' at prosecutors' decision to drop the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``John can get back to his life without having the cloud of an  
indictment hanging over his head,'' Gans said. ``It's been a 
tremendous weight lifted from his shoulders, a weight not of his 
own creation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosales remained at the Department of Housing and Urban  
Development after Cisneros left in 1996 and is an assistant to 
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo. Ms. Arce-Garcia is a top aide to 
Cisneros, who is president of the Spanish-language television 
network Univision. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were charged with one count each of conspiracy, and  
Rosales also was charged with two counts of making false 
statements. Prosecutors had hoped to convince the pair to become 
government witnesses, sources familiar with the investigation said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett's office declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros acknowledged during his Cabinet background check that  
he gave Ms. Jones financial support after their extramarital affair 
became public in 1988, costing her marriage and career as a 
political fund raiser. But prosecutors contend he falsely told the 
FBI he never paid her more than $10,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-count indictment against Cisneros alleges he paid her  
more than $264,000 between 1990 and 1993. He has pleaded innocent.

<HEADLINE> Prison Overpopulation Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People convicted of marijuana possession make  
up only a tiny percentage of the nation's prison population, drug 
experts said in arguing that legalizing or decriminalizing the drug 
would not ease overcrowding in prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 1.8 million people in the nation's prisons and jails,  
only 3 percent are incarcerated on drug possession charges and 
fewer than 1 percent for marijuana possession, the National Center 
on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University said in a 
report released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	These and other factors -- such as the fact that most possession  
convictions involve large amounts or are the result of plea 
bargaining from more serious offenses -- ``make it very unlikely 
that decriminalizing marijuana would have any discernible effect on 
the nation's prison population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates of legalization and decriminalization argue that  
non-violent drug offenders are unnecessarily taking up space in the 
nation's already overcrowded prisons at great cost to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report's release coincided with a House hearing in which law  
enforcement officials said they rarely seek prison terms for 
possession of illegal drugs. Still, advocates of easing drug laws 
said arrests for marijuana possession are at record levels, 
disrupting the lives of thousands of otherwise law-abiding 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Constantine, recently retired head of the Drug  
Enforcement Administration, said those serving federal and state 
sentences for possession were ``infinitesimal'' in number. 
``Virtually all of our investigations are geared to individuals who 
sell drugs at enormous profits,'' he told the hearing of a House 
Government Reform subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York State, which has some of the nation's toughest  
mandatory sentencing laws, fewer than 10 percent of people with no 
prior felony record who are arrested for a felony drug offense 
receive state prison sentences, said state director of criminal 
justice Katherine Lapp. Those convicted and sentenced to time 
usually receive local jail time or probation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those serving time for drug possession, 76 percent were  
arrested on more serious sale or intent to sell charges, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my county, we neither seek nor expect jail time for simple  
first-time possessors or addicts,'' said Charles Hynes, district 
attorney of Brooklyn's Kings County. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethan Nadelmann, director of the New York-based Lindesmith  
Center, a research project of billionaire philanthropist George 
Soros, said in an interview that the reality is that a high 
minority of those incarcerated for breaking drug laws in New York 
state were not convicted of violent or predatory crimes and are not 
major drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have just swept tens of thousands of people into this  
prison system,'' he said. Soros has been active in promoting drug 
policy reform. 
</P>
<P>
	R. Keith Stroup of the National Organization for the Reform of  
Marijuana Laws, which supports decriminalization and regulated 
legalization, said marijuana arrests have doubled since President 
Clinton took office and that, according to FBI figures, police 
arrested a record 695,000 in 1997 on marijuana charges, most for 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Most members of Congress are out of touch with their  
constituents, who ``know the difference between marijuana and more 
dangerous drugs, and who oppose spending $25,000 a year to jail an 
otherwise law-abiding marijuana smoker,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But focusing on arrests ``skews perception of what  
decriminalization or legalization would mean for the criminal 
justice system'' because few marijuana arrests end in felony 
convictions, the Columbia University center concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The center's chairman, former health department secretary Joseph  
Califano, said he did oppose mandatory sentences for young people 
possessing small amounts of marijuana, saying prosecutors and 
judges should be given wide discretion in order to encourage teens 
to stop using the drug.

<HEADLINE> Intel's Second-Quarter Profit Jumps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE (AP) -- Intel Corp. reported Tuesday that its  
second-quarter profit rose 49 percent, but the results failed to 
meet Wall Street expectations amid a shift in company sales to less 
expensive computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest maker of microprocessor chips, said  
it earned $1.75 billion, or 51 cents a share, two cents below Wall 
Street expectations. That compared to a profit of $1.17 billion, or 
33 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 14 percent to $6.75 billion from $5.93 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Intel released its earnings after the markets closed. Intel  
shares were trading at $65.25 in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq 
Stock Market, after slipping 6 1/4 cents during the regular trading 
session to close at $65.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel said microprocessor sales  
dropped slightly in the second quarter compared to the first 
quarter of this year. The company's average price for chips 
dropped, reflecting a shift to microprocessors as the brains of 
cheaper personal computers. Sales of sub-$1,000 PCs have boomed, 
prompting Intel to aggressively promote these less lucrative chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel chief executive Craig Barrett said the lower-than-expected  
earnings also ``reflected a seasonal slowdown, and we look forward 
to a strong second half.'' The company had regained share in the 
low-priced PC market and sales of the company's new microprocessor, 
the Pentium III, were growing strongly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Pentium III processor, a high performance multimedia  
processor for the most demanding Internet applications, is on track 
to be our fastest ramping processor ever,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prudential Securities analyst Hans Mosesman agreed that Intel  
was in a better position to increase its sales during the second 
half of this year. ``They accomplished what they wanted to do and 
the outlook is positive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosesman noted that computer sales are always higher during the  
second half of the year, which should boost Intel's business. PC 
sales generally rise during this period due to back-to-school and 
holiday sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In the six months ended June 26, Intel said it earned $3.75  
billion, or $1.08 per share. That was up from a profit of $2.45 
billion, or 69 cents a share, in the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $13.85 billion from $11.93 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	During the quarter, the company repurchased a total of 25  
million shares of common stock, at a cost of $1.5 billion, under an 
ongoing program. Since the program began in 1990, the company has 
repurchased 634.6 million shares at a total cost of $16.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Although not reflected in this period, Intel acquired Dialogic  
Corporation for $780 million in cash.

<HEADLINE> Bloody Tough for Brits in Home Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- It's tough being a British golfer at  
the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows that better than Colin Montgomerie, who has labored  
under the expectations of a country growing increasingly desperate 
for a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are well overdue, especially for a Scottish winner,  
especially my win,'' said Montgomerie, a Scot. ``Next question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the better part of three decades, British golfers have  
struggled to win their Open. Aside from Nick Faldo's three wins, 
the only other British golfer to win on home soil in the last 30 
years was Sandy Lyle in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	The Claret Jug has gone out of the country so much it could  
qualify for frequent flyer miles. In that same 30 years, Americans 
have won 18 times, including the last four Opens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who wins it is a fantastic player,'' Northern  
Ireland's Darren Clarke said. ``It just so happens they've been 
Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Open returns this week to the game's Scottish roots at the  
Carnoustie Golf Links, just across the bay from St. Andrews. But 
even that may not boost British chances that pretty much begin with 
Montgomerie and end with Lee Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
	Though a full quarter of the 156-man field consists of British  
golfers, only a handful are serious threats to end a foreign 
dominance that began after Tony Jacklin won in 1969 at Royal 
Lytham. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo, mired in the deepest slump of his career, is viewed as  
such a nonfactor that British bookies make him a 100-1 pick to win 
the Open he won three times during a six-year span ending in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still feel good about it, about being here,'' Faldo said.  
</P>
<P>
	And though Justin Rose captured the hearts and hopes of the  
country by finishing a shot behind last year as a 17-year-old 
amateur, he has played so badly since turning pro that he missed 22 
straight cuts before finally making it to the third round last 
month at the European Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any expectations this week,'' Rose said.  
</P>
<P>
	His countrymen do, though, and that has been the undoing of many  
British golfers in their home Open. 
</P>
<P>
	It took Faldo 11 British Opens and much criticism from the  
country's press before he broke through in 1987 at Muirfield with 
his first Open victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie has won 20 times on the European tour, including at  
Loch Lomond last week with a closing 64. But he has missed the cut 
in five of the last seven Opens. 
</P>
<P>
	``The amount of pressure I put on myself is enough, so there is  
no added pressure,'' Montgomerie insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Westwood had won the Loch Lomond the week before the Open last  
year and went into it anointed the favorite by the bookies and his 
country's press. But he shot himself out of contention with a pair 
of 78s in the last two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think there would be less expectation,'' Westwood  
said. ``I'm fairly comfortable with most situations now.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Slams GOP Tax Cut Approach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Accusing Republicans of taking a  
``spend now, pay later'' approach, President Clinton said Tuesday 
that GOP tax cut plans would leave no money for fixing Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will not happen on my watch,'' Clinton pledged.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's sharp rhetoric drew loud cheers from the annual  
convention of the Communications Workers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The combative stance marked a swift turn from what Republicans  
described as a cordial discussion -- but no agreement -- with the 
president Monday evening about how to spend $2.9 trillion in 
projected budget surpluses over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, at a political fund-raiser, Clinton harshly condemned the  
Coast Guard's tactics in trying to prevent six Cuban refugees from 
swimming to shore in Miami on June 29. They were blasted with a 
hose in their rowboat and one was doused with pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened with the way those people were sprayed and all  
that, it was outrageous,'' Clinton said. ``I want you to know it 
was not an authorized policy. None of us knew anything about it in 
Washington until we saw it on the news or read it in the 
newspapers, just like you did. We have taken vigorous steps to make 
sure it does not happen again and the incident is being thoroughly 
investigated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In between his luncheon labor speech and the fund-raising  
dinner, the president squeezed in an afternoon of golf at the 
Indian Creek Country Club. He also helped raise up to $1 million 
for the Florida Democratic Party at the Coral Gables home of sugar 
grower Alfonso Fanjul. Guests were asked to contribute from $25,000 
to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare, the medical insurance program for the elderly and  
disabled, is a hot political topic, particularly here in Florida 
among its large population of senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Suggesting Republicans were advocating tax cuts for political  
gains, Clinton said, ``I realize that it's tempting for a Congress 
to say ... 16 months before election, let's do what is most 
immediately pleasing, whether it's right for America over the long 
run or not. ... This is a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the Republicans generally agree that the $1.9  
trillion part of the projected surplus generated by Social Security 
should be used to reduce the national debt. However, Republicans 
want to use most of the remaining $1 trillion for tax cuts, while 
Clinton and Democrats want to use it for Medicare, a much smaller 
$250 billion tax reduction, and defense and domestic spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are putting together a tax plan today that leaves no  
resources available from the surplus for strengthening Medicare,'' 
the president said. ``That is why I am asking Republican leaders, 
in the interest of saving Medicare, to reconsider the size of their 
tax cut plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that without help from the surplus, Medicare spending  
increases would fall 60 percent below expected cost hikes in 
private insurance over the next quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would severely cut both the quality and the quantity of  
health care available to seniors on Medicare, and that will not 
happen on my watch. I won't let it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that with his own $250 billion tax cut proposal, ``We  
can still have a good size tax cut, but not as large as the one the 
Republican leaders propose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the nation faces a choice. It can wipe out the  
national debt, insure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare 
and approve his more modest tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Or a return to the spend now, pay later approach that will not  
save and strengthen Medicare, may or may not lengthen the life of 
Social Security, will certainly cut education and other vital 
programs and ... over the long run will be far more costly to every 
person in this room and every working family in the entire United 
States.''

	ValuJet Crash Prompts Indictments  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An airline maintenance company was charged today  
with murder and manslaughter in the 1996 ValuJet crash that killed 
110 people in the Everglades. SabreTech Inc. also was charged with 
unlawful transportation of hazardous waste. The third-degree murder 
and second-degree manslaughter charges, both state charges, are 
felonies. An attorney for SabreTech said the company was not going 
to be made a scapegoat for the accident. Kenneth Quinn said 
prosecutors ignored findings that the accident was caused by 
mistakes by ValuJet, SabreTech and the Federal Aviation 
Administration.

negotiate his surrender today to the Texas Rangers. 
Resendez-Ramirez, 39, turned himself in to Sgt. Drew Carter at a 
border checkpoint this morning. The surrender agreement included 
assurances of family visitation rights, a psychological evaluation 
and promises that he would be safe in jail. It does not shield 
Resendez-Ramirez from the death penalty. Carter was contacted 
Sunday by Resendez-Ramirez's sister, who said she had been in 
contact with her brother through an intermediary. Carter met with 
her Sunday night and yesterday to negotiate the surrender.

Slobodan Milosevic's resignation, and a key opposition leader 
announced a separate effort to oust the Yugoslav president. In the 
latest of near-daily protests against Milosevic, several thousand 
people turned out for an opposition rally in a central Serbian town 
even though police tried to limit attendance by blocking roads. 
Opposition leader Vuk Draskovic unveiled a campaign aimed at 
persuading Milosevic to step down, promising a series of rallies

	Study: Not-For-Profit HMOs Better  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Not-for-profit HMOs are more likely than  
for-profit ones to make sure patients get prenatal care, timely 
shots and other preventive tests and treatment, a study found. The 
study, published in tomorrow's Journal of the American Medical 
Association, concluded that for-profit HMOs' moneymaking mission 
compromises patient care. The findings have long been suspected 
because not-for-profit health plans generally spend a higher 
proportion of premiums on patient care compared with for-profits. 
That's because for-profits have to satisfy investors and pay higher 
wages.

	Selig Won't Reinstate Pete Rose

	BOSTON (AP) -- Bud Selig said today that Pete Rose can forget  
about reinstatement to baseball as long as he's commissioner. While 
Rose is among the 100 players on the ballot for baseball's 
All-Century team, he wasn't invited to the news conference before 
tonight's All-Star game and won't be asked to any ceremonies if 
he's among the winners. Former commissioner Bart Giamatti kicked 
Rose out of baseball for gambling on the sport. Rose applied for 
reinstatement in September 1997, but Selig hasn't announced a 
decision. From his statements today, it's clear the only two 
options Selig is considering are rejection or never acting on the 
petition.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Slams GOP Tax Cut Approach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Accusing Republicans of taking a  
``spend now, pay later'' approach, President Clinton said Tuesday 
that GOP tax cut plans would leave no money for fixing Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will not happen on my watch,'' Clinton pledged.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's sharp rhetoric drew loud cheers from the annual  
convention of the Communications Workers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The combative stance marked a swift turn from what Republicans  
described as a cordial discussion -- but no agreement -- with the 
president Monday evening about how to spend $2.9 trillion in 
projected budget surpluses over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, at a political fund-raiser, Clinton harshly condemned the  
Coast Guard's tactics in trying to prevent six Cuban refugees from 
swimming to shore in Miami on June 29. They were blasted with a 
hose in their rowboat and one was doused with pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened with the way those people were sprayed and all  
that, it was outrageous,'' Clinton said. ``I want you to know it 
was not an authorized policy. None of us knew anything about it in 
Washington until we saw it on the news or read it in the 
newspapers, just like you did. We have taken vigorous steps to make 
sure it does not happen again and the incident is being thoroughly 
investigated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In between his luncheon labor speech and the fund-raising  
dinner, the president squeezed in an afternoon of golf at the 
Indian Creek Country Club. He also helped raise up to $1 million 
for the Florida Democratic Party at the Coral Gables home of sugar 
grower Alfonso Fanjul. Guests were asked to contribute from $25,000 
to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare, the medical insurance program for the elderly and  
disabled, is a hot political topic, particularly here in Florida 
among its large population of senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Suggesting Republicans were advocating tax cuts for political  
gains, Clinton said, ``I realize that it's tempting for a Congress 
to say ... 16 months before election, let's do what is most 
immediately pleasing, whether it's right for America over the long 
run or not. ... This is a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the Republicans generally agree that the $1.9  
trillion part of the projected surplus generated by Social Security 
should be used to reduce the national debt. However, Republicans 
want to use most of the remaining $1 trillion for tax cuts, while 
Clinton and Democrats want to use it for Medicare, a much smaller 
$250 billion tax reduction, and defense and domestic spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are putting together a tax plan today that leaves no  
resources available from the surplus for strengthening Medicare,'' 
the president said. ``That is why I am asking Republican leaders, 
in the interest of saving Medicare, to reconsider the size of their 
tax cut plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that without help from the surplus, Medicare spending  
increases would fall 60 percent below expected cost hikes in 
private insurance over the next quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would severely cut both the quality and the quantity of  
health care available to seniors on Medicare, and that will not 
happen on my watch. I won't let it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that with his own $250 billion tax cut proposal, ``We  
can still have a good size tax cut, but not as large as the one the 
Republican leaders propose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the nation faces a choice. It can wipe out the  
national debt, insure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare 
and approve his more modest tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Or a return to the spend now, pay later approach that will not  
save and strengthen Medicare, may or may not lengthen the life of 
Social Security, will certainly cut education and other vital 
programs and ... over the long run will be far more costly to every 
person in this room and every working family in the entire United 
States.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Not-For-Profit HMOs Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For-profit health maintenance organizations'  
moneymaking mission compromises care for its members, according to 
a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, being published in today's Journal of the American  
Medical Association, found not-for-profit HMOs are more likely than 
their investor-owned counterparts to make sure their members get 
early prenatal care, timely immunizations and other preventive 
tests and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our study suggests that these plans are associated with  
reduced quality of care,'' said researchers from Harvard Medical 
School and the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a consumer 
advocacy group that favors a government-controlled health insurance 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The results should further stir public angst about HMOs as  
Congress this week debates legislation to enhance HMO consumer 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	More than two-thirds of the nation's HMOs are for-profit, about  
three times the level in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were disputed by HMOs -- both for-profit and not-for  
profit -- as well as the HMO accrediting organization whose data was 
used to conduct the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``Making these broad generalizations makes us uncomfortable,''  
said Margaret O'Kane, president of the National Committee for 
Quality Assurance, a Washington D.C.- based HMO accrediting group. 
She said health plan performance varies significantly even within 
the same region and among plans owned by the same company. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials criticized the study's authors for saying the  
results justify the need for a national health insurance system 
controlled by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if I accept their flawed analysis, managed care still  
does twice as well as the fee-for-service health plans,'' said 
Susan Pisano, spokeswoman for the American Association of Health 
Plans, a trade group which represents both for profit and 
not-for-profit plans. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, researchers analyzed 329 HMOs for how well they  
performed 14 quality indicators such as prenatal care, infant 
immunization and breast cancer screening. In each criterion, the 
not-for-profits had higher rates than the for-profits, said the 
report which reviewed 1996 patient care data. 
</P>
<P>
	To highlight the difference in results, the study estimated that  
nearly 6,000 additional breast cancer deaths would occur in the 
United States if all women between ages of 50 and 69 were enrolled 
in investor-owned rather that not-for-profit plans. Not for-profit 
HMOs screened an average of 75.1 percent of women for breast cancer 
compared to 69.4 percent for investor-owned plans. 
</P>
<P>
	In another comparison, about 48 percent of diabetics in  
not-for-profit HMOs were given an annual eye exam compared to 35 
percent of diabetics in for-profit plans. Eye exams are a crucial 
diagnostic test to measure how well diabetics are managing their 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Not-for-profit HMOs, which have recently tried to draw a  
distinction between themselves and investor-owned plans, could get 
a lift from the report. But at least one executive with a 
not-for-profit HMO faulted the study's methods. ``I don't buy it,'' 
said Dr. James Moffat, senior vice president for medical affairs at 
Miami-based Av-Med Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Moffat and other critics argued comparing not-for-profit and  
for-profit HMOs is unfair because in most cases, the types of plans 
operate differently. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest difference is that not-for-profit plans such as  
Kaiser Permanente usually have their own staff of doctors who 
exclusively treat the HMO's members. That gives the HMO greater 
control of the doctor, and ultimately, patient care. 
</P>
<P>
	For-profit HMOs, such as Aetna U.S. Healthcare, contract largely  
with the same doctors used by other HMOs. That system gives 
patients a greater choice of doctors, but reduces the impact an HMO 
can have on a physician's practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's authors say their statistical calculations took into  
account the HMO's structure and still found that not-for-profits 
performed better than for-profits in all of the quality indicators 
measured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given how consistent the findings are, it's hard to come up  
with any other explanation,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, one of the 
investigators who also heads the Public Citizen Health Research 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings have long been suspected because not-for-profit  
health plans generally spend a higher proportion of the money they 
receive in premiums on patient care compared to for-profits. That's 
because for-profits have to satisfy investors and pay higher wages 
to top executives.

<HEADLINE> Boy Pilots Toy Car Along Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFIELD, Ohio (AP) -- A 6-year-old boy who slipped away from  
his day care center managed to hot-wire a toy vehicle and drive it 
for a mile along a bustling state highway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	An alarmed motorist called police to say she was stunned to see  
little John T. Carpenter piloting the toy alongside regular-sized 
vehicles just outside Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they were investigating how John got away from  
Kiddie Kampus Pre-School and Day Care Center on Friday. Police said 
his disappearance went undetected until officers contacted the 
center more than an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy apparently wandered away from the center, then came upon  
a mini Monster truck-type toy parked outside ReRuns for Wee Ones, a 
children's resale shop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the wires unhooked so no one could ride off in it, but  
he reconnected the wires without anyone seeing him, took off the 
price tag and rode away,'' co-owner Trisha Taylor said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just floored. I couldn't believe it. This kid is only 6,  
and he had to have lifted up that hood and knew which wires to put 
together,'' Mrs. Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	John was unhurt and police returned him to his mother.  
</P>
<P>
	The Butler County Children Services Board said it will  
investigate and determine what action might be needed at Kiddie 
Kampus, said Jon Allen, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of 
Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	An employee of Kiddie Kampus declined comment to The Cincinnati  
Enquirer. The boy's mother did not return messages left by the 
newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Chang Begins Tennis Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	APTOS, Calif. (AP) -- Children played in a sandbox a few feet  
away. Spectators munched on crab cakes and pasta salad, and 
wondered aloud whether they were allowed to cheer at tennis 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Chang was back on the court Tuesday, but not at the  
French Open or the other tournaments at which he's built his 
reputation over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he began his comeback in the hinterlands of tennis. He  
played his first match since May at a challenger tournament -- the 
equivalent of a minor league game -- in a tiny sports club 
overlooking Monterey Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Chang overcame a few unforced errors at the start of the second  
set to win 6-2, 7-6 (7-5) over Wade McGuire, ranked 472nd in the 
world. It was his first match since losing in the first round of 
the French Open in late May. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel right now I'm at a little bit of a crossroads, and I'll  
do what I have to do,'' Chang said. ``And that means playing at a 
challenger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chang was No. 2 in the world a couple of years ago and has won a  
singles title on the ATP men's tour every year since 1988, the 
longest streak of any active player. He has won almost $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's trying to regain his touch in a tournament at which  
banners promote sponsors such as the Natural Neurology Center and 
Aegis Assisted Living. The winner of this week's challenger 
tournament gets $7,200. 
</P>
<P>
	It's similar to Mark McGwire trying to get back his timing in  
Triple-A, or Tiger Woods working back into shape on the Nike Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Chang is not the first player to take this route. Andre Agassi  
played in a couple of challenger tournaments in 1997 as he began a 
comeback that culminated recently with the No. 1 ranking in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Chang won the first seven points of Tuesday's match and needed  
just 38 minutes to capture the first set against McGuire, an NCAA 
singles finalist in 1982 and 1983 for Georgia. Chang dropped the 
first three games of the second set, but rallied to force the 
tiebreaker and finished off the match with an overhead winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little bit rusty,'' he said. ``This was a great match  
for me, to get out there and play a lot of tough points. I don't 
think you can duplicate these matches in practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chang had not played in a challenger event since 1987, two years  
before he became the youngest man to win a Grand Slam title when he 
captured the French Open as a 17-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	But this has been a difficult year for Chang. He has entered 14  
ATP tour events and made it past the second round just once. After 
losing to Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the first round of the French Open, 
he was bothered by back spasms and decided to skip the grass court 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Now ranked 59th, Chang hopes Tuesday's match will be the first  
step in a steady path toward the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like at this point, it's been a tough year for me, and  
to win matches is important,'' he said. ``If you don't win matches, 
you lack confidence going up against the top players. It's that 
mental toughness and confidence I need.''

<HEADLINE> UN Awards $2.8 Billion to Oil Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The United Nations has awarded nearly $2.8 billion to several  
oil companies, including more than $500 million to a subsidiary of 
Texaco Inc., for damage sustained in Middle East oil fields when 
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you remember those oil fires burning away on TV, that's  
what happened to us,'' Texaco spokeswoman Kelly McAndrew said 
Tuesday after the decision was publicized. ``The equipment, the 
facilities were destroyed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money comes from an account funded by 30 percent of Iraqi  
oil sale revenue, which is retained by the U.N. Compensation 
Commission under an agreement with Iraq. The commission rules on 
claims made by companies and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission gave the biggest share by far, $2.2 billion, to  
the Kuwait Oil Co., which had earlier received about $600 million 
for extinguishing oil well fires. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texaco subsidiary, Saudi Arabian Texaco Inc., gets $506  
million plus unspecified interest. But the company said 85 percent 
will go to income taxes in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco said its subsidiary operates on behalf of Saudi Arabia in  
the Partitioned Neutral Zone, which includes parts of southern 
Kuwait and northern Saudi Arabia. The resources in the neutral zone 
are shared equally between the two countries and operations are 
conducted through a joint operations group staffed and funded by 
the Texaco subsidiary and the Kuwait Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other American and British companies were awarded  
compensation as well in the June 25 decision, but in much smaller 
amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Halliburton Co., of Dallas, was granted $18 million;  
National-Oilwell, of Houston, got $1 million; Cape East Ltd., of 
Britain, got $671,000; Wood Group Engineering Ltd., of Britain, was 
awarded $591,000.

<HEADLINE> Euro Rallies After Hitting New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell Tuesday against the euro and the  
Japanese yen, with the euro rallying back from a new low set 
earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0164, up  
from late Monday's $1.0148. Earlier in Tuesday's trading, the euro 
slid to $1.0108, the currency's lowest level since it was 
introduced in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 121.32 Japanese yen, down from  
122.23 yen late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The afternoon recovery by the euro, which represents 11 European  
nations, came amid reports Japan's central bank may try to bolster 
the sagging currency against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the rebound, however, the euro remains about 15 percent  
below its peak of almost $1.19 on Jan. 4, its first day of trading, 
and many market analysts expect it will trade 1-to-1 with the 
dollar or lower before long. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Tuesday, the dollar also was quoted at 1.5766  
Swiss francs, down from 1.5830 a day earlier, and 1.4815 Canadian 
dollars, up from 1.4796. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound rose to $1.5574 from late Monday's $1.5559.  
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9216  
German marks, down from 1.9290; and 6.4537 French francs, down from 
6.4609.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Ban a US Beef Dealer's Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- An American beef distributor has been  
removed from the list of approved importers into Switzerland after 
traces of banned hormones were found in meat, Swiss health 
inspectors said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Swiss officials asked the United States to take action against  
the producer after two samples out of 26 tested were found to 
contain the cancer-causing hormone diethylstiloesterol, banned both 
in both countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In five other pieces of meat, inspectors from the Federal  
Veterinary Office found traces of melengestrol, a hormone banned in 
Switzerland but used in the United States to stimulate the growth 
of cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The company involved was not identified  
</P>
<P>
	The news comes the day after the United States and Canada were  
given the green light to impose $124 million per year of sanctions 
against imports from the European Union over a long-running ban by 
Brussels on hormone-treated beef, which it claims may cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland is not a member of the EU, and the Federal  
Veterinary Office said there was no question of banning U.S. beef 
entirely, although the use of synthetic hormones and steroids is 
forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 tons of U.S. beef was imported into Switzerland  
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive in Slaying Case Back in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A man accused of killing a woman and leaving  
her 2-year-old quadruplets crawling in her blood before fleeing the 
country was brought from Mexico to Florida early today. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had to agree not to seek the death penalty to win  
extradition of Jose Luis Del Toro, 22, a U.S. citizen who had put 
up a vigorous fight against his return to Florida. Mexico does not 
have the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Toro was expected to be in court in Florida this week. He is  
charged with first-degree murder in the 1997 death of Sheila 
Bellush, 35, who had moved from Texas to Florida to start a new 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	James Bellush, the victim's husband, asked a House subcommittee  
in June for help in pressuring the Mexican government to hand Del 
Toro over. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men have been convicted for their roles in the crime, and  
authorities say they have compelling evidence against Del Toro, who 
was arrested in Mexico weeks after the killing. He was in the 
country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Rocha, who was convicted of murdering Mrs. Bellush, has  
said he is willing to testify that Mrs. Bellush's ex-husband, San 
Antonio businessman Allen Blackthorne, planned her death. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury in Texas is investigating Blackthorne's role.  
Bellush also has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit accusing 
Blackthorne of arranging to have Mrs. Bellush killed after a bitter 
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackthorne has denied any involvement in the killing.  
</P>
<P>
	In a transcript of an interview published in the Sarasota  
Herald-Tribune, Del Toro told Mexican authorities he hit Mrs. 
Bellush twice, leaving her unconscious, but a man he knew only as 
Jorge actually killed the woman.

<HEADLINE> AL Pitchers Tame Sosa, McGwire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa got their chance to  
tee off at the Green Monster in the Home Run Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Once they faced Pedro Martinez, David Cone and Mike Mussina,  
they didn't even get the ball out of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit some good yesterday,'' McGwire said. ``I get my two  
strikeouts every All-Star game I get up. When you see the best of 
the best, you know ... they're going to go right at you with nasty 
stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the National League's two biggest sluggers silenced, the  
American League won the All-Star game 4-1 Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire and Sosa energized all of baseball last year with their  
great home run chase, with McGwire edging Sosa 70-66. They were the 
star attraction again this week, batting third and fourth in the 
power-packed National League lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	The only damage either inflicted came Monday night, when McGwire  
delighted the Fenway Park crowd by hitting 13 balls into screen, 
onto the street and off the light tower in the first round of the 
Home Run Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	There would be no repeat performance. After Barry Larkin and  
Larry Walker struck out against Martinez to open the game, Sosa got 
his chance against baseball's most dominating pitcher. With a 2-2 
count, Sosa waved at a high fastball to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire fared no better to open the second, swinging through  
another fast ball on a 1-2 count. It was the first time in All-Star 
history that the first four batters in the game struck out. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got the best lively arm in the game of baseball,''  
McGwire said. ``He's got three pitches that are devastating. What 
can you say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa led off the fourth with an easy popup to first base off  
David Cone and McGwire followed with a walk. 
</P>
<P>
	With runners on second and third and one out in the fifth, Sosa  
and McGwire had a chance to cut into the AL's 4-1 lead. But Mike 
Mussina caught Sosa looking and fanned McGwire to end the inning 
and the night for the two sluggers. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the NL lineup, which came into the game with 224  
homers, fared little better. And none of the players hit a ball 
against -- or over -- the Green Monster against Martinez and the AL 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would challenge anybody to score runs off that pitching  
staff,'' Larkin said. ``I was surprised nobody got a ball to yank 
over the left-field wall. In BP, everybody did it. Good pitching 
beats good hitting. That's what it came down to tonight.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Nove Lower; Dow Off 77.25 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell from their lofty highs today as  
banking and financial stocks were hit hard by concerns about Latin 
America's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 77.25 at 11,123.73 after having achieved three closing highs 
in the past four sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also dropped. The Nasdaq composite  
index fell 21.72 to 2,768.72 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 slipped 
9.67 to 1,389.43. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan fell 3 1/16 to 137 1/2 and Citigroup slipped 1 3/8 to 47 3/8,  
as the financial services sector stumbled on worries about its 
exposure to weak capital markets in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	But Merrill Lynch rose 1 5/16 to 79 3/16 on  
stronger-than-expected second quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Latin American markets fell sharply Monday on what  
analysts described as lingering concern about the state of the 
region's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks also were under pressure from investor concerns that the  
brisk economy will cause the Federal Reserve to raise interest 
rates again this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has been overbought quite a bit in the few weeks  
and we expected it to have some kind of reaction,'' said Eugene 
Mintz, financial markets analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were mostly down as investors prepared for  
Intel to release its second quarter earnings after the market 
closed. Intel, the world's leading computer chip maker, was down 3/8 
at 65 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Biotechnology giant Amgen soared 5 7/16 at 71 3/4 after the  
company's profit report late Monday beat Wall Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com rose 5 3/16 to 122 9/16 after announcing it is  
expanding it Web site to include toys and electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 356.67 million 
shares, up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 3.98 at 651.81, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 6.96 at 808.58.

<HEADLINE> Europe Frets Over Euro's Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Champagne corks popped in a burst of  
``euro-phoria'' across the continent last January as Europe took 
its biggest step toward unity: launching a single currency for 11 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	But leaders who gushed about the newborn euro as a symbol of  
united Europe's economic power and political maturity are now faced 
with the embarrassment of dealing with a child who is not living up 
to expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than challenge the dollar for dominance in world  
financial markets, the euro has nose-dived -- weighted down by 
sluggish growth in Europe compared to the booming United States. It 
also is suffering from conflicting signals from European 
policy-makers about how low the currency would or should be allowed 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly there are teething troubles,'' said Peter Dixon,  
senior economist with Commerzbank in Frankfurt. ``This is not what 
was envisaged six months ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After peaking at almost $1.19 on Jan. 4, its first day of  
trading, the euro has lost 15 percent of its value, hitting a new 
low Tuesday in European trading of $1.0108. In New York, the euro 
finished at $1.0164. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite constant assurances from government leaders and central  
bankers about the euro's underlying value, market-watchers expect 
it will be 1-to-1 with the dollar or even lower before long. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven of the 15 European Union nations adopted the euro:  
Austria, Belgium, Germany, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, 
Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Sweden, Denmark and 
Britain opted to stay out for now. Greece did not meet the economic 
criteria for entry, but hopes to join in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the currency is used mainly by corporate and government  
bookkeepers. Euro bills and coins won't start circulating until 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	But its decline is still felt by ordinary people. German marks,  
French francs, Italian lira and other national currencies are 
locked into a fixed exchange rate with the euro, meaning they move 
in the same direction. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro's slide has its benefits, helping the European economy  
recover from last year's doldrums by boosting exports and 
encouraging growth. That improvement, in turn, fuels rallies on 
European stock markets, along with U.S. investors hunting for 
bargains. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there are liabilities, and not just for Europeans who find  
their vacations abroad more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	A weak euro irritates the United States, exacerbating its trade  
deficit and making it harder to sell U.S.-made products in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into a G-7 finance ministers meeting on Tuesday in  
Brussels, Belgium, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers made no 
secret that he intended to talk about the euro. ``The U.S. can't be 
an importer of last resort,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The weak euro also hurts European homebuyers by pushing up  
mortgage rates, which are linked to rates on long-term bonds. Rates 
have climbed because of investor worries that higher prices 
Europeans have to pay for imports will reignite inflation, which is 
almost flat now. 
</P>
<P>
	And if the euro falls too far, it could spur the kind of  
investor flight that hit other parts of the globe over the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 1-to-1 parity is an important psychological level,'' said  
Joachim Fels, senior economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. If 
the euro drops much below that, ``investors may lose confidence in 
euro-assets. More people are likely to bail out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The European Central Bank, which sets monetary policy for the  
euro countries, insists the currency's fall is temporary and 
nothing to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech last week, bank vice president Christian Noyer  
acknowledged the euro has ``fluctuated significantly,'' but pointed 
out its current level is roughly where the constituent currencies 
were two summers ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet while European Central Bank president Wim Duisenberg has  
said he's not losing any sleep over the euro's slide, others, like 
Hans Tietmeyer, president of the respected German central bank and 
an ECB council member, have expressed dismay. 
</P>
<P>
	German Finance Minister Hans Eichel, who last week said the  
euro's level was ``no problem'' and ``good for exports,'' urged his 
EU colleagues on Monday to coordinate economic policy better to 
send a positive signal to financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, his Finnish colleague, Sauli Niinistoe, sent the euro  
lower by suggesting there were ``natural reasons'' for its 
weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The mixed messages confuse the markets and contribute to the  
euro's downward trend, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Duisenberg faces more questions on the bank's stance at his  
regular monthly news conference Thursday. But analysts say it may 
be too late for the ECB to try to intervene in the market to boost 
the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be perceived as an admission of weakness,'' Dixon  
said, and probably end up sending the euro even lower. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, he and other analysts say, the best strategy may  
be to wait for Europe's economic recovery to push the euro up 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has to make the jump by itself,'' said Deutsche  
Bank analyst Joachim Goldberg, who projects the euro will be back 
up around $1.08 to $1.10 in six months. ``It's just a question of 
timing.''

<HEADLINE> Albright: African Aid Key To U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stung by criticism that African countries get  
little more than lip service in humanitarian aid, Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright told the NAACP today that ensuring freedom 
and economic stability on the African continent remain major U.S. 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nowhere in the world are there stronger or braver people than  
those Africans working at the grass roots for justice and lasting 
peace,'' Albright told an audience of 2,000 at New York's Hilton 
Hotel, where the NAACP is holding its 90th annual national 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. policy-makers have been accused by many segments of black  
America, including the NAACP, of treating African nations like poor 
stepchildren when international aid dollars are passed out. 
</P>
<P>
	The criticism was renewed during the military action in  
Yugoslavia as aid flowed freely for Balkan refugees while less 
attention and funding were doled out to civilians displaced in 
conflicts in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Others in black leadership also questioned why such aggressive  
military action was taken by U.S.-led NATO forces to blunt ethnic 
slaughter in Yugoslavia and no such force was used while lives were 
being taken in ethnic clashes in Rwanda a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said the United States has been able to do more to stop  
the warring in Europe than in Africa because America has more 
allies in Europe to share risks and ``promote understanding and 
economic integration to foster peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In Africa, such resources are scarce,'' Albright said. ``But  
that's no excuse for disengaging or giving up. Instead it is a 
challenge, as President Clinton has suggested, to use the lessons 
of Kosovo to help us do better in Africa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright announced Clinton will soon appoint a special envoy to  
focus on reducing human rights abuses and revitalizing the regional 
peace effort in strife-torn Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have taken this step because the people of Sudan deserve  
not delay but decisiveness,'' Albright said.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Team Awaits Wheaties Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. (AP) -- General Mills Inc. is working on a  
deal to bring the U.S. women's soccer team to a breakfast table 
near you. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Valley-based maker of Wheaties is talking with the  
team and its players about an appearance on the cereal box, company 
spokesman Greg Zimprich said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are definitely interested in the women's World Cup team,''  
Zimprich said. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been confusion about whether the company thought the  
team worthy of its orange cardboard pedestal. Team star Mia Hamm 
got the impression that General Mills wasn't interested, prompting 
Hamm to say that her squad preferred sweeter cereal anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, because we were not an official World Cup  
sponsor we did not have access to the players prior to the games,'' 
Zimprich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Noonan, chief marketing officer for U.S. Soccer, said  
discussions with the cereal maker ``started long before the 
tournament and have been ongoing.'' He said U.S. Soccer is trying 
to establish long-term ties with General Mills, including a team 
sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping to do something that's not a one-time hit,''  
Noonan said. 
</P>
<P>
	A team spokesman said players had fanned out across the country  
and could not be reached immediately for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	General Mills has been inundated with calls from people  
wondering if they would find the country's soccer sensations on 
supermarket shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	If General Mills goes ahead with the Wheaties box, it's unclear  
whether select players or the entire team would appear. A 1998 box 
honored the U.S. women's hockey team, which brought home a gold 
medal from the Winter Olympics at Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the 20 hockey players still had college eligibility and  
were not pictured on the box because NCAA rules prohibit athletes 
from participating in any marketing that would imply they endorse a 
product.

<HEADLINE> Canucks Sign Center Cassels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Center Andrew Cassels signed  
a three-year, $7.5 million contract with the Vancouver Canucks on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassels, who turns 30 on July 23, was paid $1.2 million last  
year while scoring 12 goals and 37 points in 70 games for the 
Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassels, who played six seasons with the Hartford Whalers, said  
escalating salaries can cripple small-market teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is sad in a way when a team can spend more money and take  
the better players and make everybody's price go up,'' he said 
during a conference call. ``Obviously it's hurting the Canadian 
teams more than the American teams but I don't think you can blame 
a player when somebody offers you a certain amount of money. They 
won't say `no, I don't want that much. Give me less if it's going 
to help you out.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Money wasn't the only factor in Cassels' decision. Canucks  
general manager Brian Burke was Hartford's GM during the 1992-93 
season when Cassels had his best year, with 21 goals and collecting 
85 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassels was Montreal's first-round draft choice, 17th overall,  
in 1987. He played 60 games for the Canadiens before being traded 
to Hartford in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Michael Schumacher Leaves Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTHAMPTON, England (AP) -- Michael Schumacher was released from  
hospital today, two days after breaking his right leg in two places 
in a high-speed crash in the British Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old German left Northampton General Hospital in an  
ambulance in mid-morning. Schumacher and his wife, Corinna, were 
expected to fly later today to their home in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time world champion plowed into a tire wall on the first  
lap of Sunday's British Grand Prix at Silverstone. His rear wheels 
are believed to have locked up as he attempted to round a sharp 
right-hand curve. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher was airlifted to the hospital, where surgeons  
inserted a foot-long pin in his right leg to fix the fractures of 
his tibia and fibula. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking from his hospital bed Monday, Schumacher said he was  
``lucky to be alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expected to be out of action for two to three months  
and wrote off any chances of winning the Formula One drivers' 
championship. However, he said he was confident of racing for 
Ferrari again before the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Joan Rumsey, Northampton General's nursing director, said  
Schumacher played cards and watched television with his wife Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``This morning he has been reviewed by the surgical team who are  
very pleased with his progress,'' she said. ``The movement in 
Michael's ankle and knee continues to improve. He is now requiring 
minimal pain relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeon Bill Ribbans, who carried out the operation on  
Schumacher's leg, said the driver was recovering well and was 
``very determined'' to get better. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Schumacher was ``in good spirits'' as he left the  
hospital.

	LONDON (AP) -- Julian Lennon says dad John Lennon would have  
resented his musical career if he had lived long enough to see it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing his insecurities, I think he might not have liked me  
doing well,'' Lennon, 36, said in this week's Hello! magazine. 
``That was one of his problems.''

</P>
<P>
	``It's very sad he isn't here,'' she said of the former Beatle,  
who left her when Julian was 5 and was gunned down in 1980. ``On 
the other hand, if he had still been here, it may be -- and this is 
a terrible thing to say -- that John would have ended up 
overshadowing Julian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Julian recently relaunched his career after a break of several  
years with the single ``I Don't Wanna Know.''

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Student-Initiated Prayer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A federal appeals court has thrown out  
part of a judge's ruling that restricted the right of students to 
pray and lead prayers in Alabama schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled 3-0 on  
Tuesday that a federal judge wrongly restricted student-instigated 
prayer at DeKalb County schools. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court did not throw out the judge's restrictions against  
school officials leading prayers or other religious activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suppression of student-initiated religious speech is  
neither necessary to, nor does it achieve, constitutional 
neutrality towards religion,'' the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was brought by Michael Chandler, a former vice  
principal at Valley Head High School in DeKalb County. 
</P>
<P>
	He claimed the schools unconstitutionally promoted Christianity  
with pre-game prayers at athletic events, teacher-led devotionals 
and distribution of Bibles at school by Gideons International. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Ira DeMent agreed, and in 1997 issued an  
injunction against the schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union joined in the suit, and said  
it may appeal the latest ruling. But the ACLU said the ruling 
vindicated much of their position. 
</P>
<P>
	``School teachers still can't grab students and ask them to pray  
in a class, which is what they were doing in DeKalb County,'' said 
Pamela Sumners, an attorney for the ACLU. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor said he was pleased with the  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a victory for all the school children in the public  
schools of our state, that they do not surrender their 
constitutional rights when they attend a public school in Alabama. 
They do not surrender their religious faith and their religious 
beliefs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sumners predicted that school superintendents will  
misinterpret the ruling and think it's OK to have a teacher 
participate in a religious activity at school. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be right back just where we were,'' she said. ``We'll  
have to go reinvent the wheel that the Supreme Court invented for 
us in 1963. But hey, that's why God invented the Supreme Court.''

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Growth Shifts to West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cities that fail to attract high-technology  
industries risk being left behind in a new economy dominated by the 
Internet and industries such as telecommunications and 
biotechnology, a study of U.S. metropolitan areas concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Areas best suited to lure new high-tech businesses, however, are  
those that already have them or have strong research facilities 
that could help nurture young companies, according to a study 
released Tuesday by the Milken Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``High technology certainly will determine which areas of the  
country are succeeding. Areas without high-tech are going to be 
left behind,'' said Ross DeVol, the report's principal author. 
``There are still remnants of the old economy around, but the new 
economy is here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Western metropolitan areas, led by San Jose, Calif., have become  
the strongest magnets for growth over the past two decades, the 
study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Western cities hold four of the top five positions in a study  
ranking 50 cities on the basis of their concentration of 
high-technology jobs and revenues they produce. Boston is ranked 
fourth after Los Angeles, with Seattle metropolitan area fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, the situation was reversed. Only one western city, San  
Jose, ranked in the top five. Rochester, Minn., Williamsport, Penn. 
and the Kalamazoo-Battle Creek, Mich. led the list, followed by San 
Jose and Sherman, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
	Rochester, where IBM built mainframe computers, lost ground when  
the company failed to anticipate the switch to personal computers. 
Williamsport fell off the top-50 in the early 1990s, when defense 
cutbacks led to a shakeup in the aerospace industry. 
Kalamazoo-Battle Creek fell in the rankings because it's primary 
high-tech industry, drug manufacturing, has declined as a share of 
the overall national economy, said DeVol. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a massive migration west,'' said DeVol. ``Overall  
what you see is either a combination of either being heavily 
concentrated in a product that waned in importance, like the 
mainframe computer, or with one firm that completely missed the 
boat in changes in technology, and generally higher business 
costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose remains the undisputed center of technology development  
with a composite score of 23.6. Scores were based on a complex 
formula that considers several factors, including the impact of 
technology on the local economy and its contribution to the total 
revenue produced by the nation's high-tech companies. In 1998 San 
Jose accounted for 5.8 percent of a total national high-tech output 
of $1.5 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, Dallas scored 7 and Los Angeles 6.9.  
</P>
<P>
	Silicon Valley, which includes San Jose and surrounding cities,  
remains the world's technology capital despite an exceptionally 
high cost of living and problems like traffic congestion and 
housing shortages, DeVol said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very high-cost location, and there is a lot of  
(traffic) congestion, but most major firms still want to have a 
presence there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas benefitted from a diversified technology base that  
includes the world headquarters of GTE Corp. and the U.S. 
headquarters of Canada-based Nortel Corp., Stockholm-based L.M. 
Ericsson, Japan's Fujitsu LTD and the French telecommunications 
company Alcatel SA. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles' No. 3 ranking resulted from the growth of  
multimedia entertainment, including small special effects companies 
that cater to the film industry. The figures for Los Angeles, 
however, are inflated because of the way the federal government 
compiles movie-industry data. 
</P>
<P>
	Because there is no separate category for multimedia, DeVol  
included all movie industry revenues as part of the area's total 
high-tech output. If non-multimedia could be filtered out, Los 
Angeles probably would fall to fifth or sixth place on the list, he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Newsmagazines, Movies Top Nielsens / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At a time of light summertime television  
viewing, newsmagazines and movies dominated the ratings last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tuesday edition of ``Dateline NBC,'' which featured a story  
on a woman accused of attacking her husband, was the week's 
top-rated program. CBS's ``60 Minutes'' narrowly came in second. 
</P>
<P>
	Four newsmagazines and three movies filled Nielsen Media  
Research's top 10. ABC's Monday movie, ``She Woke Up Pregnant,'' 
topped the feature film chart, Nielsen said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS won the week with a 6.6 rating and 13 share. NBC was second  
with a 5.8 rating and 11 share, ABC had a 5.7 rating and 11 share 
and Fox was at 4.4 and 9. The WB had a 2.3 rating and 4 share, UPN 
had a 1.4 rating and 3 share and Pax TV was at 0.7 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB was heartened by the ratings for its new comedy, ``Movie  
Stars.'' It scored the highest rating for the network in its Sunday 
time slot since last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the poor ratings for back-to-back episodes of  
``Suddenly Susan'' on July 5 had to depress NBC: The two shows had 
fewer viewers than anything else last week on ABC, CBS or NBC. 
``Suddenly Susan'' is coming back next fall in revamped form. In 
NBC's defense, Monday was a holiday for many viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
6.8 rating and 16 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 6.7 
rating and 16 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 5.9 and 
14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of July 5-11, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 9.3; ``60 Minutes,'' 
CBS, 9.2; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 8.7; ``ABC Monday Night Movie: She Woke 
Up Pregnant,'' ABC, 8.5; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 8.4; 
``20/20-Friday,'' ABC; 8.0; ``CBS Sunday Movie: Streets of Laredo, 
Part 1,'' CBS, 8.0; ``CBS Wednesday Movie: A Perfect World,'' CBS, 
7.9; ``Friends,'' NBC, 7.9; ``60 Minutes II,'' CBS, 7.8.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Refugee Threatened Fire on Boat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- One of 16 Cubans fleeing their country aboard a  
boat doused the vessel with fuel and threatened to set it afire 
during a four-hour standoff with the Coast Guard, The Miami Herald 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The standoff miles off the Miami Beach shoreline ended  
peacefully when the Cubans -- 13 men and three women -- willingly 
boarded a cutter Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under U.S. policy, Cubans who reach land are allowed to stay but  
those picked up at sea are sent back. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guardsmen rode alongside the Cubans' 16-foot motorized  
wooden boat, urging them to stop. At one point, as the Guardsmen 
got close, one of the Cubans grabbed a container and sloshed fuel 
around the boat, motioning that he would set it afire if the boat 
was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crew could smell the fuel, it was so strong,'' Petty  
Officer Jeff Murphy told The Miami Herald. ``After he doused the 
vessel, it became clear they were serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The standoff ended in international water about 17 miles off  
Miami Beach when the vessel's motor stopped, possibly because of 
mechanical failure, and the boat began to drift. 
</P>
<P>
	That peaceful conclusion was in contrast with a tense  
interdiction Friday in an inlet in north Broward County, which 
ended when a Coast Guard cutter collided with a boatload of 12 
Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	The collision threw the refugees into the ocean and one woman  
drowned. The 11 survivors were taken to the U.S. Naval Station at 
Guantanamo, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard statistics show 951 Cubans have been detained at sea  
so far this year. That is almost as many as the 1,047 interdictions 
for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a threat of a mass exodus,'' said Jose Basulto,  
president of Brothers to the Rescue, a Miami-based Cuban exile 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard came under scrutiny last month after television  
helicopters captured images of Coast Guardsmen using pepper spray 
and water hoses to deter six Cubans trying to reach U.S. soil. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men who swam to shore were arrested by police. Four others  
were captured by the Coast Guard. The incident sparked protests, 
and all of six men were allowed to remain in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard investigation led to the reassignment of eight  
Coast Guardsmen.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Railway Killer in Custody </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, the train-riding  
fugitive suspected of killing eight people who lived near railroad 
tracks, surrendered at a border checkpoint today in a deal brokered 
by his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old drifter, who is charged or wanted for  
questioning in the slayings in three states and was on the FBI's 10 
Most Wanted List, surrendered at the Ysleta port of entry to Texas 
Rangers Sgt. Drew Carter, state investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carter told me that he extended his hand, they shook hands,  
and they handcuffed him. He was very pleasant, not aggressive,'' 
said state Department of Public Safety Capt. Bruce Casteel. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he didn't know how long Resendez-Ramirez had been in  
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez, wearing gold-rimmed glasses, appeared briefly  
before a magistrate, saying only ``no, sir'' twice when asked if he 
had questions. The suspect was escorted into the courtroom in 
handcuffs and a chain around his waist. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, motorcycle police escorted a white van that carried  
Resendez-Ramirez to the airport and a flight to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The surrender agreement with Resendez-Ramirez included  
assurances of family visitation rights, a psychological evaluation 
and promises that he would be safe in jail, Casteel said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it does not shield Resendez-Ramirez from the death  
penalty, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez's sister, who lives in Albuquerque, N.M., called Carter  
on Sunday while he was on a fishing trip and said she had been in 
touch with her brother through an intermediary, said Mike Cox, 
state Department of Public Safety spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, an FBI agent and a deputy U.S. marshal met with the  
sister Sunday night and Monday to negotiate the surrender on a 
burglary warrant related to one of the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez's ability to elude law enforcement had been an  
embarrassment to law enforcement. On June 2, he was released by 
Border Patrol agents, even though he was already wanted by the FBI 
and Houston police had told the immigration service they wanted him 
for questioning in a murder. The Border Patrol agents had picked 
him up for illegal entry and sent him back to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	But Immigration Commissioner Doris Meissner said the Immigration  
and Naturalization Service, parent of the Border Patrol, had 
multiple entries on Resendez-Ramirez in a computerized photo and 
fingerprint database that provides immediate identification of 
aliens apprehended by the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after that release, authorities believe, he killed a  
73-year-old woman west of Houston. The following day, they say, he 
killed a 26-year-old Houston schoolteacher at her home. His 
fingerprints then were found June 15 in Gorham, Ill., at the scene 
of the slaying of a 79-year-old man and his 51-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS first encountered Resendez-Ramirez in 1976 after he was  
arrested in Michigan. He was returned to Mexico, but since then has 
been deported from the United States three times -- in 1985, 1987 
and 1991. He also was apprehended by Border Patrol agents eight 
times since January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissner said the Justice Department inspector general would  
look at why Resendez-Ramirez ``was not detained and whether INS 
knew about Resendez-Ramirez's criminal activities after being 
contacted by local law enforcement earlier this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the killings in June, Lexington, Ky., police  
obtained warrants last month for Resendez-Ramirez's arrest in 
connection with the August 1997 murder of University of Kentucky 
student Christopher Maier, who was attacked with his girlfriend as 
they walked near some railroad tracks. The girlfriend, who was 
raped, survived. The charges are murder, two counts of first-degree 
robbery and single counts of rape and assault. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was linked to the Dec. 17, 1998, sex slaying of Dr.  
Claudia Benton, 39, at her home in West University Place, a 
well-to-do community that is surrounded by the city of Houston; and 
the slayings of the Rev. Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic, 46, and his wife, 
Karen, 47, in the parsonage behind Weimar (Texas) United Church of 
Christ. They were beaten to death with a sledgehammer and were 
found May 2 after they failed to show up for Sunday services. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect's real name is Angel Leoncio Reyes Recendis,  
according to a birth certificate, but authorities had been using 
the name Resendez-Ramirez, one of his aliases.

<HEADLINE> EEOC Alters Complaint Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  
announced regulations Monday intended to streamline the process for 
federal employees filing discrimination complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines require all agencies to set up programs for  
informally resolving disputes both before and after complaints are 
filed. They also eliminate the authority of agencies to make final 
decisions in cases where an administrative judge has issued a 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	EEOC Chairwoman Ida L. Castro said the regulations are part of  
an effort to improve the complaint process for federal employees 
and applicants ``by eliminating unnecessary layers of review and 
addressing perceptions of unfairness in the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, in the past, agencies could reverse or modify an  
administrative judge's decision on whether the law had been broken. 
The new regulations no longer allow agencies to alter the decisions 
of the judge. The agency can either implement the order or file an 
appeal with the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	By next year, agencies must establish or make available  
alternative dispute resolution programs that incorporate 
confidentiality, neutrality and enforceability. 
</P>
<P>
	Other regulations seek to relieve additional burdens on the  
system. For example, some cases currently would be broken down and 
then processed separately. The new rules seek to consolidate 
related claims brought by the same party and add a provision for 
the dismissal of spin-off complaints, which are complaints about 
the processing of existing complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Other provisions encourage settlements between agencies and  
complaining parties. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations -- published in the Federal Register -- will take  
effect Nov. 9 and apply to pending cases.

<HEADLINE> Seven Found Shot to Death in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Shot once in the elbow, 11-year-old Santonio  
Lucas hid in a closet for eight hours, terrified that the gunman 
who killed his mother, aunt and four other children would finish 
him off. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngster told his father the massacre began after his  
mother told her boyfriend that she was breaking off their 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Described by neighbors as a smart, happy-go-lucky boy who enjoys  
Nintendo and basketball, Santonio was the only survivor of a 
shooting rampage in which seven people were killed yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	Family and friends said the victims included Santonio's mother,  
her sister and four young people. Also dead was a man believed to 
be the husband or boyfriend of Santonio's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``The possibility does exist that one of the persons inside, who  
is also deceased, is responsible for all the shootings and that 
injury to himself was self-inflicted,'' Deputy Police Chief C.B. 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Santonio approached neighbor Georgia Hall several hours  
after the killings, he told her his stepfather had done the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said: `My stepfather shot my mama, my auntie, my brother,  
everyone,''' Hall said in today's Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Santonio's father, David A. Lucas, spent the night in a hospital  
with his son, and reported that the boy said the shooting started 
after his mother confronted the man. 
</P>
<P>
	``She told him she was ready to break it off,'' David Lucas told  
WSB-TV today. ``I guess he couldn't take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Lucas' sons, 13 and 8, were killed. Police did not  
release the victims' identities. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers were called shortly before 3 p.m. after Santonio sought  
help from neighbors. He told police the shooting started before 6 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just as sweet as he could be, and God had to be with  
him for him to hide,'' said Betty Fuller, who lives two doors down 
in the predominantly black neighborhood of single-family homes and 
well-kept yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fuller said that Santonio's mother had lived in the house  
with her sister and their five children for three years. She said 
the boyfriend started coming around about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fuller said Santonio's mother was attentive to her children  
and friendly, always stopping to wave and chat -- unless the 
boyfriend was around. 
</P>
<P>
	After arriving at the house, police were kept outside for about  
three hours by a pit bull and a Rottweiler inside the home. After 
Animal Control workers coaxed the dogs out, detectives found the 
carnage. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you might imagine, there are bodies in a number of rooms,  
there is quite a bit of blood,'' Jackson said, adding that at least 
one gun was found in the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Santonio was in stable condition and alert, hospital officials  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's interacted fairly well with the physicians and nursing  
staff of the emergency department, answering questions 
appropriately, given the things that he's gone through,'' Dr. Leon 
Haley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors say the children often played in the family's front  
yard. ``They were really good kids,'' said Shirley Lee, who lived 
down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm devastated,'' said Gikeivia Johnson, a cousin of the  
family.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Pushes Adoption Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are opening a new front in the  
abortion wars, moving to require federally funded clinics to talk 
about adoption when counseling pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a duty to inform young women about the adoption  
option. If we don't, fewer women will choose adoption,'' said a 
statement by Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va., who 
planned to introduce the legislation in the House Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would require clinics and health centers that receive  
federal funding to counsel women on adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood, which receives much of  
this of funding, said counselors already talk about adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	``The anti-abortion forces would have everyone think that we  
force abortion, that you walk in for a Pap smear and they said, 
'Why not have an abortion instead?''' said Sandra Jordan of Planned 
Parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you call most of the clinics in the country, they already  
talk calmly and rationally about the options,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But backers say it's not so common. A fact sheet prepared by  
Rep. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., a co-sponsor, cited a University of 
Illinois study that found 40 percent of people who identify 
themselves as ``pregnancy counselors'' never raise the option of 
adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would also create a new $7 million grant  
program. National adoption organizations could apply for the money 
to train the staff of health centers on adoption counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the legislation passed, though, the program would still  
have to compete with other domestic programs for money.

<HEADLINE> Canseco May Be Facing Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Jose Canseco feels betrayed, again.  
</P>
<P>
	A week after saying he had overcome so many injuries that he  
didn't think there was anything else he could hurt on his body, the 
Tampa Bay Devil Rays slugger is headed back to the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors expect him to make a full recovery from back surgery,  
but he conceded retirement might be an option he has to consider if 
he doesn't come back and swing the bat the way he's accustomed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it has been a lot of surgeries and a lot of pain ...  
I'm not taking it for granted,'' he said Monday of the prospect of 
returning and continuing to produce like he did the first half of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting a career-high 46 homers for the Toronto Blue Jays  
last year, Canseco was on pace to post even better numbers in 1999 
when stiffness in his lower back was replaced Sunday by 
excruciating pain that prompted surgery to repair a herniated disc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you have to have a little bit of luck, and I don't  
have it,'' the Devil Rays designated hitter said from his hospital 
bed in Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just incredible,'' Canseco added. ``I compare it to a  
high-performance car. One little spark plug can be loose, and the 
whole car won't run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, who leads the AL with 31 homers and is hitting .276  
with 69 RBIs, was selected as the league's starting DH for 
tonight's All-Star game in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	He apologized to fans who voted for him and who were also hoping  
to see him in Monday night's home run derby competition at Fenway 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``This to me is a nightmare with the year I'm having, the  
consistency I've had ... The timing couldn't be worse,'' he added. 
``I was given all the ability in the world. Not to be able to use 
it is one of the worst things that can happen to a human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco and the Devil Rays are not sure what caused the intense  
pain that left the 35-year-old no alternative than to undergo 
surgery similar to the operation he had for a ruptured disc on his 
left side in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Although doctors said he could have opted for non-surgical care,  
Canseco said he was in such discomfort that he was almost certain 
that he had the same type of injury that had forced him to undergo 
surgery the last time. 
</P>
<P>
	The only difference was, this time, the bad disc was on his  
right side. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just happens. There aren't too many indications,'' said  
Canseco, who left in the eighth inning of Friday night's game 
against Florida in Miami because of stiffness in his back. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco sat out Saturday night's game, then had an MRI Sunday  
that revealed a severely compressed nerve was causing weakness in 
the toes of his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco said surgery eliminated the pain, but it will be several  
weeks before the scar tissue from the incision in his back heals 
enough for him to start rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said he will be sidelined up to six weeks. Canseco  
recalled it took about two months to return from back surgery three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, who signed a one-year contract with the Devil Rays last  
winter with a base salary of $2 million, already has earned 
$250,000 in bonuses for making 300 plate appearances ($200,000) and 
the All-Star team ($50,000). He's not likely to make the 500 plate 
appearances that would guarantee him a $3 million contract for next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if his mention of possible retirement was out of  
frustration or if it was a serious consideration, Canseco 
emphasized that he wants to continue to play -- preferably in Tampa 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely frustration. But you have to consider it if  
you can't come back and play the way you want to. ... I don't want 
to hurt a lineup,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My future is unsure right now. And it's not because of a lack  
of ability, but a lack of health. There are not a lot of guys in my 
shoes who can say they have the ability to hit 50 or 60 home runs, 
but won't get a chance to do it because they can't stay healthy. I 
don't know what I could do if I stayed healthy all year round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays would like to give him a chance to see.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everything he did for us the first half of the season would  
lead to believe that if everything goes well with the surgery and 
he handles the rehab the way it should be handled that he'll be 
with this club next year,'' general manager Chuck LaMar said.

<HEADLINE> FTC: No New Internet Privacy Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission recommended to  
Congress today that new Internet privacy laws are not needed to 
protect consumers because companies on the Web are voluntarily 
creating rules for handling sensitive personal information. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 14-page report, the FTC acknowledged that the online  
industry's efforts are not widespread, and some Web sites ``still 
do not understand the importance of consumer privacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with a 3-1 endorsement, commissioners decided that new  
federal privacy laws are ``not appropriate at this time'' for the 
Internet, the worldwide computer network used by roughly 100 
million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is not to say all that needs to be done has been done,''  
FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky said today in testimony before the 
House Commerce Committee's telecommunications panel. ``...If 
progress does not continue at something like the pace we've seen so 
far, then I think it's time to reconsider the legislative 
solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Orson Swindle suggested it would be impossible for  
government to enforce privacy promises that U.S. companies make on 
Internet sites that number in the millions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Try to imagine how the FTC would enforce this,'' Swindle told  
lawmakers. ``Then we must punish. That represents a heck of a 
dilemma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her partial dissent, Commissioner Sheila F. Anthony said  
Congress should consider setting minimums for protecting personal 
details that consumers might disclose online. 
</P>
<P>
	``Progress has been far too slow,'' Anthony said today. She  
warned that if Congress doesn't pass privacy laws, Americans won't 
be satisfied and a ``patchwork of state laws will emerge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Consider the confusing online environment that could emerge,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation from the FTC, which has taken a lead role  
helping formulate U.S. policy toward the Internet, was a victory 
for online companies. The industry feared mandatory privacy rules 
that could raise its costs even in these earliest stages of 
electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is not the time to intervene in the marketplace,'' said  
Christine Varney of the Online Privacy Alliance, an industry trade 
group. ``There's been a real validation here that if you give the 
market a chance to work, it will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House failed to meet a self-imposed deadline this  
summer for negotiating with the European Union about how new 
international privacy laws might affect U.S. businesses online. 
European Union First Secretary Gerard De Graaf said the FTC report 
probably wouldn't affect those continuing talks, but he said 
Europeans wanted Congress to pass privacy laws too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly our preference is one of legislation, at least in some  
important areas,'' De Graaf said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC's decision clearly was influenced by an industry-funded  
study this spring showing dramatic improvement since last year in 
the number of companies that tell consumers how personal 
information collected about them on Web sites is used. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that nearly two-thirds of commercial Internet  
sites displayed some warning that businesses were collecting 
personal details from visitors, such as names, postal and e-mail 
addresses and even likes and dislikes. A similar study in 1998 
found only 14 percent did. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's really remarkable progress, and the industry deserves a  
lot of credit,'' Pitofsky said. ``Having said that, that doesn't 
mean they're anywhere near the goal line. There's a lot more to be 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy groups complained bitterly that the government was  
abandoning consumers to corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is the FTC being so indulgently lenient?'' asked Jason  
Catlett of Junkbusters Corp., a New Jersey-based privacy group. 
``It is extremely disappointing that the FTC found fair information 
practices not widespread, yet failed to recommend that they be 
imposed on an industry that is obviously never going to go much 
further than they're forced to.''

<HEADLINE> NAACP Sees Progress in Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NAACP reported improvement Tuesday in how  
the hospitality and telecommunications industries treat blacks in 
hiring, contracting, marketing and philanthropic activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest and oldest civil rights organization issued  
report cards rating companies in both regards at its 90th annual 
national convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw a whole lot of failures when we started this, but now  
we are seeing incremental improvement,'' NAACP President Kweisi 
Mfume said. ``We aren't satisfied, but we are seeing positive 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grades are based on how firms hire, promote, procure, contract,  
advertise and donate to minority causes. 
</P>
<P>
	When the first survey was conducted in 1997, the NAACP and 55  
other black organizations urged a boycott of 10 national hotel 
chains because of their hiring and promotion practices. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Westin Hotels, Best Western International, Radisson  
Hospitality Worldwide, Renaissance Hotels and Resorts, Choice 
Hotels International, Holiday Inn Worldwide and Omni Hotels refused 
to participate. All got ``F'' grades. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 13 hotel firms studied in this year's survey got  
less than a ``C.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They included Marriott International, B+; Cendant Hotels, B+;  
Hilton Hotels Corp., B; Best Western International, B-; Promus 
Hotel Corp., B-; Choice Hotels International, C+; Hyatt Hotels 
Corp., C+; Radisson Hospitality Worldwide, C+; Four Seasons Hotels, 
C+; Bass/Holiday, C;, Wyndham, C; Starwood, C; and Omni, C. 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume said that since the Adam's Mark Hotels chain is involved  
in pending litigation with the NAACP, that company wasn't graded. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were laughed at three years ago by the hotel industry, but  
others took us very seriously,'' Mfume said. He said Bill Marriott, 
a principal in the Marriott Hotel chain, met with NAACP officials 
after the first grades were issued to see how his company could do 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	NAACP National Board Chairman Julian Bond called the report  
cards ``a new mechanism to achieve an old goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are interested in economic justice,'' Bond said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mfume said the improvement among telecommunications companies  
wasn't as dramatic as that of the hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 15 companies studied, just one, Alltel, received a  
failing grade for not responding to the survey. Mfume said he was 
told by company officials they couldn't respond because of changes 
in their corporate structure. Mfume said, ``We take exception to 
that position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A company spokesman was not immediately available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth and Bell Atlantic both received B+; SBC, Ameritech and  
GTE, B; AT&AMP;T, B-; Cincinnati Bell and MCI WorldCom, C+; Excel, 
Sprint, Frontier, USWest and AirTouch, C; and QWest, D+. 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume said financial service companies would be the next  
industry surveyed.

<HEADLINE> Study: Carpal Tunnel Symptoms Common </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Although only 2.7 percent of adults can be  
diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome, many more suffer pain, 
tingling and numbness in their hands, a new study has found. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedish study is among a few to estimate the general  
prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome, said the authors and experts 
not involved in the work, published in Wednesday's Journal of the 
American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	And the study highlights the difficulty of diagnosis -- neither  
physical examination nor electrical-impulse testing alone 
consistently identified the nerve problem on which the potentially 
disabling disorder is blamed, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, no consensus exists on how to diagnose carpal tunnel  
syndrome, even though U.S. doctors perform 200,000 surgeries a year 
to treat it, and direct U.S. medical costs are estimated at more 
than $1 billion, the outside experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpal tunnel syndrome has been on the rise in developed  
countries with increasing computer-keyboard use. It is also getting 
more attention in industries with jobs involving repetitive wrist 
or finger motions, ranging from meat processing to operating a cash 
register. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the enormous impact of carpal tunnel syndrome, a strong  
base of knowledge might be expected to exist about its cause, 
progression and diagnosis, said the experts, Drs. Alfred Franzblau 
and Robert A. Werner of the University of Michigan School of Public 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
	``Surprisingly, this is not the case,'' they wrote in an  
editorial accompanying the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Because disagreement exists about whether carpal tunnel syndrome  
is defined by results of physical examination or electrical 
nerve-function tests, both were included, said researchers led by 
Dr. Isam Atroshi of Hassleholm-Kristianstad Hospital in 
Kristianstad, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	``Symptoms of pain, numbness and tingling in the hands are  
common in the general population,'' reported the authors, who found 
symptoms in 14.4 percent of subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-fifth of those have carpal tunnel syndrome, a  
prevalence of 2.7 percent, they said.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The WNBA All-Star game just became more  
star-studded. 
</P>
<P>
	Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy, Brandi Chastain and other members of the  
World Cup soccer team will attend the sold-out WNBA All-Star game 
at Madison Square Garden Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitney Houston will sing the National Anthem and supermodel  
Tyra Banks will perform at halftime with 100 New York City youth 
dancers. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Spike Lee, a regular at Knicks games, actor Tracy  
Ullman and singer Liza Minelli are also expected to join the 19,563 
fans at the inaugural All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Liberty forward Rebecca Lobo, who was voted to the  
All-Star team despite her season-ending knee injury, will be 
cheering on her Eastern Conference teammates from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I may have gotten a few sympathy votes,'' said Lobo,  
who signed autographs during all-star festivities on Monday. ``My 
mom may have realized you can vote more than once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie sensation Chamique Holdsclaw of the Washington Mystics  
will start for the Eastern Conference along with teammate Nikki 
McCray and the Liberty's Teresa Weatherspoon and Kym Hampton. 
</P>
<P>
	Lobo's replacement in the starting lineup has not been  
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time in my life I can cheer for Chamique,''  
said Lobo, whose team has lost twice to the Mystics this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheryl Swoopes, the fan favorite with 84,632 votes, will start  
for the Western Conference. She'll join second-place vote-getter 
Cynthia Cooper (80,806) and Tina Thompson of the Houston Comets, 
Lisa Leslie of the Los Angeles Sparks and Michele Timms of the 
Phoenix Mercury. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star game may be the perfect occasion for the WNBA's  
first dunk, Hampton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The All-Star game is for spectacular stuff,'' said Hampton,  
who will guard Leslie. ``(Lisa) could dunk. I would move aside and 
let her dunk because this is for women's basketball. This is for 
people to say, `Wow.' We're here to have a great time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like most all-star games, the players will be loose.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this is going to be up-in-your-face championship  
defense,'' Hampton said. ``The fans want to see scoring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-year-old Alexandra Ruiz is so enthralled with the WNBA that  
she and her mother traveled from Sacramento, Calif., to see the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Ruthie Bolton-Holifield and Nykesha Sales,'' said Ruiz,  
a fifth-grader who plays basketball and soccer. ``Ruthie has a good 
attitude and she plays really good and believes in herself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz and her mom Anne Gorman are Sacramento Monarchs  
season-ticket holders. She's looking forward to the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think its going to be really cool to see players I haven't  
seen before,'' Ruiz said. ``I like the WNBA because then we'll 
know, at least the boys will know, that women can play basketball 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Cleveland's Linda Hill-MacDonald will coach the East  
all-stars and Houston's Van Chancellor will coach the West. ... 
Liberty guard Vickie Johnson was selected to fill Lobo's all-star 
spot, but Hill-MacDonald will decide who will getting the starting 
forward nod. ... The WNBA attendance is down 2.8 percent from last

down slightly from 9,970 of last season.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Flyers Announcer Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Former Philadelphia Flyers announcer Gene  
Hart was in critical condition Tuesday with illnesses stemming from 
a ``malignancy,'' but was holding his own, team doctor Jeff 
Hartzell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart became severely dehydrated and developed an infection  
following chemotherapy to treat a tumor, Hartzell said. He was 
admitted to the critical-care unit of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has shown some improvement over the last 48 hours,''  
Hartzell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broadcaster was under sedation and on a ventilator, Hartzell  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some individuals do respond to these treatments and we're  
hoping and praying that Gene is one of them,'' Hartzell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart underwent heart bypass surgery in 1985 and has been on  
kidney dialysis for almost a year due to complications from 
diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for years as the ``Voice of the Flyers,'' Hart was the  
play-by-play man for the Flyers on radio and television from their 
inaugural season in 1967-68 until 1994-95. For the last two 
seasons, he has called the games for the Philadelphia Phantoms, the 
Flyers' American Hockey League affiliate, on cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997, one of  
20 broadcasters so honored.

<HEADLINE> Basketball Star Recker Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURANGO, Colo. (AP) -- Former Indiana basketball star Luke Recker  
remained in good condition Tuesday at a southwestern Colorado 
hospital recovering from injuries received in a weekend car crash 
allegedly caused by a drunken driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercy Hospital spokesman Joe Wade Plunk said Recker may leave  
the hospital as early as Wednesday.` 
</P>
<P>
	Recker suffered a severe laceration on his left ear and a head  
laceration. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's getting better,'' Recker's father, Clair Recker, said.  
``There's no reason to believe he won't make a full recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recker and four friends were injured in the three-car accident  
Saturday night on County Road 240 near Durango in southwestern 
Colorado. He was a passenger in a vehicle driven by John Hollberg, 
23, of Senoia, Ga., who was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the most seriously injured were Kelly Craig, 19, of  
Jasper, Ind., identified by Plunk as Recker's girlfriend, who 
suffered a spinal fracture, and her brother, Jason Craig, 17, who 
suffered a closed head injury, Plunk said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Craigs were placed in the intensive care unit of the San  
Juan Regional Medical Center in Farmington, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	Plunk said the medical center advised him late Monday that Kelly  
Craig had recovered movement in her arms but not in her legs. 
</P>
<P>
	A hospital spokeswoman said Kelly Craig was in serious condition  
Tuesday and Jason Craig, a high school football player, remained in 
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker and his companions were traveling to a carnival in  
Durango when a truck driven by Bob Hardwick, 21, of Durango, 
drifted across the center line at about 70 mph, State Trooper Mike 
McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck sideswiped a pickup carrying 11 people in Recker's  
group and collided head-on with the car in which Recker was a 
passenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardwick was being held for investigation of vehicular homicide,  
reckless driving, driving under the influence, careless driving 
resulting in bodily injury and vehicular assault. During a court 
appearance Monday, La Plata County Judge Martha Mino reduced 
Hardwick's bond from $500,000 to $50,000.

<HEADLINE> Sosa, McGwire Tamed by AL Pitchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa got their chance to  
tee off on the Green Monster in the Home Run Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Once they faced Pedro Martinez, David Cone and Mike Mussina,  
they didn't even get the ball out of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit some good yesterday,'' McGwire said. ``I get my two  
strikeouts every All-Star game I get up. When you see the best of 
the best, you know ... they're going to go right at you with nasty 
stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the National League's two biggest sluggers silenced, the  
American League won the All-Star game 4-1 Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire and Sosa energized all of baseball last year with their  
great home run chase, with McGwire edging Sosa 70-66. They were the 
star attractions again this week, batting third and fourth in the 
power-packed National League lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	The only damage either inflicted came Monday night, when McGwire  
delighted the Fenway Park crowd by hitting 13 balls into the 
screen, onto the street and off the light tower in the first round 
of the Home Run Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	There would be no repeat performance. After Barry Larkin and  
Larry Walker struck out against Martinez to open the game, Sosa got 
his chance against baseball's most dominating pitcher. With a 2-2 
count, Sosa waved at a high fastball to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was putting everybody away with the fastball,'' said  
Walker, who played with Martinez in Montreal. ``He was throwing the 
ball very hard and throwing it very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire fared no better to open the second, swinging through  
another fast ball on a 1-2 count. It was the first time in All-Star 
history that the first four batters in the game struck out. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got the best lively arm in the game of baseball,''  
McGwire said. ``He's got three pitches that are devastating. What 
can you say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's Jeff Bagwell, who struck out in the second inning as  
the final batter against Martinez, was left almost speechless by 
Martinez's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was impressive,'' Bagwell said. ``There's not much more to  
say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa led off the fourth with an easy popup to first base off  
Cone and McGwire followed with a walk. 
</P>
<P>
	With runners on second and third and one out in the fifth, Sosa  
and McGwire had a chance to cut into the AL's 4-1 lead. But Mussina 
caught Sosa looking and fanned McGwire to end the inning and the 
night for the two sluggers. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the NL lineup, which came into the game with 224  
homers, didn't fare much better. And none of the players hit a ball 
against -- or over -- the Green Monster against Martinez and the AL 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would challenge anybody to score runs off that pitching  
staff,'' Larkin said. ``I was surprised nobody got a ball to yank 
over the left-field wall. In BP, everybody did it. Good pitching 
beats good hitting. That's what it came down to tonight.''

	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- An American neo-Nazi who was convicted in  
Germany of spreading hate propaganda has been denied a handgun 
permit in Nebraska because of the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Lauck said Monday he is appealing the June 29 decision by  
Lincoln Police Chief Tom Casady. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauck, 46, was convicted in Germany in 1995 of inciting racial  
hatred and distributing pro-Hitler and anti-Jewish propaganda in 
violation of the German Constitution. Lauck, who was born in 
Milwaukee and came to Nebraska as a boy, spent roughly four years 
in six different European prisons. He was deported by Germany 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Police cited the felony conviction in denying Lauch the permit.  
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to a Lancaster County Court, Lauck argued his  
conviction in Germany cannot be held against him in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I refuse to be criminalized for practicing free speech in the  
United States of America, especially by our own so-called 
government,'' Lauck said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Casady said the denial was based on the law.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I wouldn't have denied it if I did not feel I could  
defend the decision,'' Casady said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nebraska chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union was  
researching constitutional issues arising from the denial, said 
Matt LeMieux, the chapter's director. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was convicted of something in Germany which would be  
protected under the First Amendment here in the United States,'' 
LeMieux said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauck said he now divides his time between Lincoln, where his  
mother lives, and Syracuse, a town near Lincoln.

<HEADLINE> Kids Plead Innocent in Killing Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- Two 14-year-old boys have pleaded  
innocent to charges of plotting a massacre at their middle school. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Schnepp and Jedaiah Zinzo were arraigned yesterday on  
charges of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnepp and Zinzo, who will be tried as adults, could face life  
in prison if convicted. Their trial is scheduled for Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Two 13-year-olds, Daniel Fick and Jonathan McDonald, have also  
pleaded innocent to conspiracy charges in the case. Their trial is 
scheduled for Sept. 8, but prosecutors say they may request that 
all four be tried together. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses testified during preliminary hearings that the teens  
were plotting to stage a robbery to obtain firearms, then seize the 
school office, use the public address system to call an assembly in 
the gym and massacre students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they foiled the plot after classmates reported  
it to school officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys remain in custody in the St. Clair County Juvenile  
Center on $100,000 cash bond.

<HEADLINE> Man Dies in Yosemite Waterfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A hiker who stopped to  
soak his feet in the Merced River slipped on algae-covered rocks 
and was swept to his death over a 594-foot waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Siddiq Parekh, 31, was climbing Half Dome peak with three  
friends Saturday when they stopped near a foot bridge over the 
river. The current carried him over Nevada Fall, and he fell onto 
the rocks below. 
</P>
<P>
	Parekh's friends called for help on a cellular phone. Rangers  
using a helicopter recovered his body a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Parekh was described as an experienced hiker who had made  
several trips to Yosemite. Parekh is the fourth person to die at 
Nevada Fall in the last five years, park spokeswoman Christine 
Cowles said. 
</P>
<P>
	A large sign above the fall warns hikers of the dangers.  
</P>
<P>
	``The sign essentially says you may die if you swim here, and it  
says it in several different languages,'' Yosemite spokesman 
Kendall Thompson said. ``But it doesn't seem to make any 
difference.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stocks Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed lower Tuesday, with  
the key index in Taipei tumbling 3 percent as tensions mounted 
between Taiwan and China after Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui 
said Beijing should regard the island as a separate country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 259.40  
points, or 3.1 percent, to 8,204.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese officials have called Lee a ``liar and separatist''  
after he said in an interview with a German radio last week that 
Taiwan's relations with the mainland are ``state-to-state'' rather 
than a province within a country as China has claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	About one third of Taiwanese listed companies have investments  
in China, and their business could be hurt by tensions between the 
two sides, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell  
93.09 points, or 0.51 percent, to end at 18,181.09. On Monday, the 
average closed up 336.45 points, or 1.88 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese share prices fell as companies sold shares which they  
had held in other companies to cement business relations, a 
practice known as cross-shareholding. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also took profits following the day-earlier surge,  
traders said. The biggest declines were in high technology sectors, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, buying in internationally competitive blue chips  
continues to underpin the market amid hopes Japan's economy will 
recover, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 122.14 yen in  
late-afternoon trading, unchanged from late Monday in Tokyo and 
below its late New York level of 122.23 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai stock prices closed sharply lower in line with other  
declines in regional bourses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 11.62 points, or 2.2  
percent, to 500.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong shares fell on profit-taking.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, fell 80.91 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 
13,980.93. On Monday, the index slumped 160.73 points, or 1.1 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said investors continued to take profits ahead of the  
impending slew of quarterly corporate profit reports in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend was the Australian stock market, where prices  
rose following a positive outlook for interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney's All Ordinaries Index rose 13.7 points, or 0.4  
percent, to 3,063.9. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower. The benchmark  
NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 3.17 points, or 1.1 percent, to 
2,174.07. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed sharply lower for the second  
consecutive day on concerns that local interest rate will rise. The 
Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 16.75 points, or 1.6 
percent, to 987.50. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed slightly lower. The Philippine  
Stock Index fell 1.72 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,604.49. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed lower in listless trading. The  
Straits Times Index fell 20.29 points, or 0.92 percent, to 
2,178.49. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed mostly lower. The main  
Composite Index fell 9.48 points, or 1.1 percent, to 842.01. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed lower as political concerns  
weighed on investors. The Composite Index fell 6.937 points, or 1.1 
percent, to 656.187.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Adds Toys, Electronics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com's online superstore will get even  
bigger today as the Internet retailing powerhouse adds thousands of 
toys and electronics to its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based company announced today that it has started to  
sell everything from Barbie dolls and Pokemon trading cards to DVD 
players and electronic organizers on its site. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the latest move by Amazon.com to become a massive online  
shopping hub, where consumers can find a vast array of merchandise 
at the click of a mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doesn't everyone just hate shopping at big toy stores and  
electronics stores? It's miserable, so we are giving people a 
better and easier alternative,'' said Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com's 
founder and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	While Amazon.com has yet to turn a profit in its four years in  
business, the company hasn't stopped spending money to make itself 
into a more diversified online retailer and expand its customer 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last 14 months, the company has gone from being  
exclusively an online bookseller into an Internet shopping hub 
offering music, videos, auctions and electronic greeting cards. It 
now has more than 10 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com also has also invested millions of dollars in online  
pharmacy drugstore.com, Internet pet shop Pets.com, and 
cybersupermarket HomeGrocer.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com has been testing toys and electronics on its site  
since November, when it began selling a limited supply of both in 
its online gift shop. It will close the gift shop today. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's serious push into toys and electronics comes as  
analysts expect big growth in both areas. Internet research firm 
Jupiter Communications predicts online toy sales will rise from 
$52.6 million in 1999 to $550 million by 2002, while sales of 
consumer electronics on the Internet will grow from $78 million 
this year to $792 million in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	In its latest online foray, Amazon.com is working with more than  
320 toy manufacturers, including the mass-market giants such as 
Mattel and Hasbro and the smaller companies that usually only sell 
to specialty toy shops. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoppers will be able to browse the merchandise by age, category  
or price. They can also see the site's list of best-selling toys or 
those toys deemed best by outside toy experts. Comments and ratings 
from other customers also will be posted. 
</P>
<P>
	And the toy store isn't just for kids. A ``Toys for Grownups''  
area includes office toys, retro classics and party games. 
</P>
<P>
	With its toy store, Amazon.com moves into a market now dominated  
by eToys, which has been online since 1997 and has become an 
Internet superstore for kids. Amazon.com will also come up against 
Toys R Us, the huge traditional retailer that has struggled to find 
its way on the Internet but now is the process of building up its 
online arm -- toysrus.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The new electronics store will feature gadgets and appliances  
from top manufacturers, including 3Com, Sharp and Panasonic. 
</P>
<P>
	A buying guide to Amazon.com's electronics offerings includes  
detailed information on all its products composed by an in-house 
staff as well as reviews by fellow consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also in-depth technical data on the products, pictures  
of goods and thorough lists of frequently asked questions, such as 
warranty policies and customer service questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many of its brick-and-mortar competitors, Amazon.com will  
offer a 30-day, money back guarantee and will not charge a 
restocking fee for items that have been open. Many retailers make 
shoppers pay up to 15 percent of the purchase price if they try to 
return an item that has been opened.

<HEADLINE> Senate GOP Scores HMO Victories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Casting the opening votes on patient rights,  
the Senate defeated a Democratic effort Tuesday to make insurance 
companies pay for any treatments that doctors say are medically 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	In a string of votes, Republicans also opted to restrict many of  
their provisions to the 48 million Americans whose health plans 
fall exclusively under federal regulation. They also rejected 
Democratic amendments on women's health and emergency room care. 
</P>
<P>
	``All in all, I think we had a pretty productive day,'' said  
Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the defeats, Democrats believe they scored points in a  
political debate that has become as much about next year's 
elections as policy. Neither side has been willing to compromise, 
and President Clinton has signaled he will veto the GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
	At every turn, Democrats are trying to expand HMO protections,  
while Republicans prefer a more modest approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing illustrated that better than who would be covered.  
</P>
<P>
	On a 53-47 vote, the Senate opted to apply many of the new  
rights only to the 48 million Americans in health plans that are 
now exempt from state regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	This includes patient protections involving emergency room care,  
access to obstetricians-gynecologists and the right to keep a 
doctor during a course of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats want to cover another 113 million others who live in  
states that may or may not have approved the protections on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about denying millions of Americans the right to  
protection,'' Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans argued that the federal government should not  
interfere with health plans that are already subject to state 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats' effort to make HMOs pay for many treatments they do  
not now cover -- one of the most contentious issues in the debate 
over HMOs -- failed on a 52-48 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic bill would have made health insurance companies  
pay for care consistent with ``generally accepted principles of 
medical practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans argued that sometimes the most common practices  
are not the best. They replaced the Democratic medical necessity 
provision with their own system allowing patients to appeal if care 
is denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Won adoption of a measure that would allow self-employed people  
to deduct the full cost of their health insurance from their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Defeated, 52-48, a Democratic measure that would let women  
designate their obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care 
doctor. It also would have allowed women to stay overnight in the 
hospital after a mastectomy if a doctor recommended it. Republicans 
said they would offer a modified version of the same idea later 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	--Adopted, 52-48, an amendment highlighting the cost of the  
Democratic bill. Under the amendment, the bill's provisions would 
be canceled if they increased costs by more than 1 percent. 
Congressional auditors estimate that the Democratic provisions 
would raise insurance premiums 4.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in federal legislation has grown over the past few  
years as health maintenance organizations and other managed care 
plans have come to dominate the health insurance market. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, some 80 percent of people with private insurance are in  
managed care, which tries to control costs by eliminating 
unnecessary care and coordinating treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	States have adopted many of the rules being debated in  
Washington, but their laws do not affect health plans that fall 
under federal regulation. Different rules from state to state also 
have created a patchwork of benefits across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate debate is the first after more than a year of  
discussions. It quickly bore into fundamental differences between 
Republicans and Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hammered their theme -- that the Democratic measures  
go too far, and will increase the cost of health insurance and 
prompt employers to drop coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that at the end of the week we'll pass a good bill,''  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said. ``What I hope we 
don't do is pass another government-controlled program that's run 
by bureaucrats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases -- like ob-gyns, for instance -- the differences  
between the parties are small. Republicans would allow women to see 
an ob-gyn without a referral but would not allow the ob-gyn to be a 
primary care doctor who makes other referrals. 
</P>
<P>
	In others, the differences are wide. Many of the Republican  
provisions only include the 48 million people who are in health 
plans that are exempt from state regulations. Democrats want to 
include all 161 million Americans who have private health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under their proposal, two-thirds of the Americans are left  
out,'' Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said Tuesday, adding that the 
Republican measures ``riddled with loopholes ... completely are a 
sham.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats know they are outnumbered and unlikely to prevail in  
the end. But they hope to put the GOP through a series of votes 
that they hope will make Republicans appear to be against patients. 
</P>
<P>
	With neither side interested in compromising, no bill is likely  
to become law. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad that we can't sort of get together,'' said Sen.  
Olympia Snowe, a moderate Republican from Maine. ``It's very 
frustrating, to be honest with you.''

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- British forensic experts in Kosovo  
have uncovered the bodies of 11 children, some as young as 2 years 
old, shot at close range by Serb forces, Britain's foreign

	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, the Mexican  
drifter suspected of killing eight people as he made his way around 
the U.S. on freight trains, turned himself in Tuesday. 
Resendez-Ramirez ended a six-week manhunt by walking with a brother 
across a bridge between Mexico and El Paso, Texas, where a Texas 
Ranger arrested him. The deal was set up by the fugitive's sister. 
Authorities say the surrender agreement includes assurances of 
family visits, a psychological evaluation and promises that 
Resendez-Ramirez will be safe in jail.

also rejected a Democratic amendment that would have given women 
more flexibility in their health care and longer hospital stays 
after mastectomies. Republicans won both votes, 52-to-48, in the 
opening votes on the issue of patients' rights. Democrats want to 
cover more people with farther-reaching rules. Republicans prefer a 
more modest approach.

pregnant women. ``We have a duty to inform young women about the 
adoption option. If we don't, fewer women will choose adoption,'' 
said a statement by Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va.,

book Tuesday night. Martinez struck out five in two innings, 
leading the American League over the Nationals 4-1 for its third 
straight win. Martinez became the first pitcher to strike out the 
first three hitters in an All-Star game, fanning Barry Larkin, 
Larry Walker and Sammy Sosa. The Boston ace, already halfway to the 
magic 30-win mark at the break, kept up the streak by striking out 
Mark McGwire to begin the second inning.

	Thomas Nazzaro, 17, of Durham, N.H., disappeared Sunday evening  
on Matanuska Glacier. Searchers found no sign of him Monday, even 
after lowering a 250-foot fiber-optic cable with a video camera 
attached into the 7-foot-wide hole. The search was called off. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did not see anything but more ice and water. The hole is  
extremely deep,'' State Trooper Sgt. Rae Arno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nazzaro was taking part in a month-long mountaineering class  
offered by the National Outdoor Leadership School. The 11 students 
had spent 26 days at the glacier 80 miles from Anchorage, climbing 
several peaks in the surrounding Chugach Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	The students were traveling without their three instructors at  
the time. The instructors were several miles behind and felt 
confident in the students' abilities, said Don Ford, Alaska branch 
director for NOLS. 
</P>
<P>
	NOLS has been teaching mountaineering classes in Alaska since  
the early 1970s and has had one other death -- a student who fell 
during an expedition on Mount McKinley in 1971, Ford said.

<HEADLINE> Legalized Pot Said a Danger to Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Young people who smoke marijuana are far more  
likely than nonusers to move on to harder drugs, a substance abuse 
research group concludes in a report that opposes efforts to 
legalize or decriminalize nonmedical marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teen experimentation with marijuana should not be considered a  
casual rite of passage,'' said Joseph Califano, chairman and 
president of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse 
at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teens who smoke marijuana are playing a dangerous game of  
Russian roulette,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The center's report was released as the House Government Reform  
Committee held a second hearing today on pros and cons of 
decriminalizing drugs. Testifying were former Drug Enforcement 
Administration head Thomas Constantine and advocates of relaxed 
laws on marijuana use. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marijuana stands convicted as a gateway drug,'' Califano  
concluded, citing conclusions in the report that youngsters 12 to 
17 years old who smoke marijuana are 85 times more likely to use 
cocaine than those who do not. 
</P>
<P>
	Other studies have drawn different conclusions about the linkage  
between marijuana and more potent drugs. The National Institute of 
Medicine, in a study last March on the medical uses of marijuana, 
said that while the drug can cause respiratory disease, there is no 
evidence that it leads to other drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	The Califano report, which focuses on nonmedical use of  
marijuana, said the drug is especially dangerous for teens, 
impairing short-term memory, stunting intellectual and emotional 
growth and increasing the likelihood of unprotected sex as well as 
leading to other drugs such as cocaine or heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	It said that of 182,000 teens and children who entered treatment  
in 1996 for substance abuse, nearly half, 48 percent, were admitted 
for marijuana abuse or addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	That compared to 19 percent for alcohol and a secondary drug, 12  
percent for alcohol alone, 3 percent for smoked cocaine, 2.4 
percent for methamphetamines and 2.3 percent for heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	The report concluded that decriminalization or legalization of  
marijuana would surely increase use among teen-agers and children. 
But it also opposed mandatory sentences for possession of small 
amounts of marijuana, saying prosecutors and judges should be given 
wide discretion in order to encourage teens to stop using the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mandatory sentences are particularly insidious where teens  
convicted of possession of marijuana are concerned,'' Califano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that 70 million Americans have tried marijuana,  
making it the nation's most commonly used illegal substance. In 
1998, almost 23 percent of 12th graders said they had smoked 
marijuana within the past month, and just under one-half had tried 
marijuana during their lives.

<HEADLINE>  World Cup Champs on Whirlwind Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In training, the U.S. women's soccer team loaded  
up on pasta and other foods packed with carbohydrates. On the 
players' first night in New York, some celebrated their World Cup 
victory over China by going out for Chinese food -- and then dancing 
at the China Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The choices of cuisine and nightlife were just coincidence,  
backup goalkeeper Saskia Webber insisted with a slight grin. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, it has nothing to do with it,'' she said Monday night as  
she and about seven teammates entered the China Grill restaurant in 
midtown Manhattan to a standing ovation from patrons. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the diners was Jim Hook, a youth soccer referee from  
Memphis. ``This is a tremendous thrill,'' he gushed. ``All my kids 
love them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another diner, attorney Lisa Babiskin, 27, also was thrilled for  
the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should absolutely go out and celebrate their  
accomplishment,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The players hoisted champagne toasts after a dizzying tour of  
New York for appearances on network shows from ``Good Morning 
America'' and ``Today'' to CNN and Fox News Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	While some of the players headed home after the grueling  
three-week World Cup tournament, others stayed in New York for a 
rally set for today. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, some players will participate in the Ladies  
Professional Golf Association JAL Big Apple Classic Pro-Am in 
suburban New Rochelle, while others will attend the WNBA All-Star 
Game at Madison Square Garden that night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're sharing it with New York City because big things happen  
here,'' said Brandi Chastain, standing amid midtown skyscrapers and 
sharing the sidewalk with the bustling suit-and-tie crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	It was her game-winning penalty kick Saturday at the Rose Bowl  
that set off a whirlwind of activity. The players were welcomed at 
Disneyland on Sunday, then flew overnight, landing at Newark 
Airport at 4:30 a.m. and piling on a bus to Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mia Hamm also was glad to be celebrating in New York.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun,'' she said. ``I love New York. There's so many  
things to do and so many things to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lunchtime crowd gawked at the women in matching lavender  
shirts. Then the realization hit the onlookers: These were those 
soccer players. 
</P>
<P>
	If there were any doubt, the players locked arms and began  
singing ``We are the Champions!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all worth it,'' said Chastain, who had not slept since  
early Sunday. ``We're promoting women's soccer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain was on the 1991 U.S. World Cup championship team and  
remembered one solitary media representative greeting the team when 
it returned to the United States that year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were 2,000 media credentialed this year,'' she said.  
``More people are paying attention to women's soccer, and we feel 
very proud of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The media push was on full blast. Full-page ads from major  
companies like Nike, Chevrolet and Budweiser saluted the victory in 
newspapers. HarperCollins trumpeted a new book by star player Mia 
Hamm. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain thinks she and her teammates proved a crucial point.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety thousand in the Rose Bowl and record television ratings  
gives validity to what we've been saying all along,'' she said. 
``There is a place for this team in pro sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After dinner Monday, around 11 p.m., eight of the players headed  
to The China Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Webber, the backup goalie, said her brother suggested the club  
as a great spot for some Monday night dancing. 
</P>
<P>
	Club owner Michael Barrett welcomed the champions.  
</P>
<P>
	``First the China Grill, then The China Club, and they beat  
China,'' he said. ``There you go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain said she and the other players worked hard to win the  
World Cup and needed a relaxing night of boogying to disco tunes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight we just want to forget about being soccer players and  
listen to the music,'' she said from the club about 12:30 this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The club's disc jockey congratulated the players, who bumped  
hips with each other and friends on the dance floor while other 
clubgoers applauded.

<HEADLINE> Field Set for Meadowlands Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The Panderosa and Badlands Hanover,  
the two early favorites, drew the outside post positions for the $1 
million Meadowlands Pace, creating a little more wide-open race on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panderosa, who is part of a Peter Pan Stables' entry with  
Stutzpan, drew the outside No. 10 post on Tuesday for Hall of Fame 
driver John Campbell. The entry was made the 2-1 morning-line 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Badlands Hanover drew post No. 9 for driver Ron Pierce.  
</P>
<P>
	It was somewhat ironic that The Panderosa and Stutzpan drew  
poorly for Peter Pan Stables' owner Robert Glazer. He was upset 
with the draw for the three eliminations last week because of an 
error by the track in forming the fields and he went to court to 
change it. 
</P>
<P>
	A state appeals court agreed with him on Friday and the fields  
had to be redrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Glazer is stuck with this draw.  
</P>
<P>
	``The post position draw certainly doesn't help us,'' Glazer  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, the winning driver in four previous Meadowlands Paces,  
said that while The Panderosa is a versatile colt, his strategy is 
set for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're coming out as hard as he can go,'' said Campbell, who  
last won the race in 1995 with David's Pass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panderosa and Badlands Hanover, both sons of Western  
Hanover, each finished second in their respective eliminations last 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A winner of three of four starts, The Panderosa was beaten by a  
nose by the late-charging Blissfull Hall, who was driven in the 
third elimination by Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
	Badlands Hanover was second to the pacesetting Grinfromeartoear  
despite taking a few bad steps in the stretch in the first 
elimination. It was the third straight second-place finish for the 
Joe Holloway-trained colt. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce was faced with an interesting choice after the  
eliminations. While Badlands Hanover is very highly regarded, 
Blissfull Hall posted the fastest winning time in the eliminations, 
a 1:51 mile that included a 25.2 second final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The lightly raced Blissfull Hall, who has earned only $173,079,  
was not his choice. He went with Badlands Hanover, who paced the 
final quarter in 25.4 despite the bad steps. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Ben Wallace then gave Daniel Dube the job of driving  
Blissfull Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	As for post positions, Wallace got just what he wanted: No. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	Luc Ouellette, the leading driver at the Meadowlands this meet,  
also opted not to drive an elimination winner in the final. He 
guided Sign of Success to the winner's circle in the second 
elimination, but elected to drive Mystical Shark, who was third to 
Blissfull Hall, in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Here is the field in post position order with colt, driver and  
odds: 
</P>
<P>
	Blissfull Hall, Dube, 8-1; Grinfromeartoear, Jack Moiseyev, 5-1;  
Goliath Bayama, Sylvain Filion, 12-1; Sign of Success, David 
Miller, 10-1; Mystical Shark, Ouellette, 6-1; Art's Conquest, Mike 
Lachance, 10-1; Washington VC, George Brennan, 20-1; Stutzpan, 
William O'Donnell, 2-1; Badlands Hanover, Pierce, 7-2, and The 
Panderosa, Campbell, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The race is scheduled for 10:42 p.m. Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Stocks sink; Dow Down 107.33 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices fell sharply in early trading on Wall  
Street today as banking and financial stocks were hit hard by 
concerns about Latin America's economic recorvey. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 107.33 at 11,093.65, an abrupt turnaround from three closing 
highs in four sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also dropped. The Nasdaq composite  
index fell 23.74 to 2,766.70 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 slipped 
11.82 to 1,387.28 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan fell 3 7/16 at 137 1/8 and Citigroup slipped 1 11/16,  
as the financial services sector stumbled on worries about its 
exposure to weak capital markets in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Latin American markets fell sharply Monday on what  
analysts described as lingering concern about the state of the 
region's economic recovery. Bond prices rose for a second straight 
sessions as nervous investors sought the security of U.S. Treasury 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 98.12 million share, 
up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 4.46 at 651.33, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 4.13 at 811.41. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.5 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 1.6 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 1.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Move To Add Cap Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- With running back Garrison Hearst's  
future still in question, the San Francisco 49ers are moving to 
clear salary cap room and add another running back. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the team opened contract talks Tuesday with a  
representative for free-agent running back Charlie Garner, Hearst 
was in the midst of a three-doctor, cross-country sojourn seeking 
opinions on how best to treat career-threatening complications 
clouding his recovery from a broken lower left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in negotiations with (Garner) but we have not reached an  
agreement at this time,'' general manager Bill Walsh said through a 
team spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner's agent, Scott Crawford, did not immediately return a  
phone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers were trying to create cap room by reaching a long-term  
agreement with wide receiver Terrell Owens, who is signed to a 
one-year, $3.5 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	A multiyear pact would allow the 49ers to spread the economic  
impact over the life of the deal and thus create the up to $2 
million in cap space they need to add a free-agent back and sign 
their eight draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides are close to a deal -- only a few incentive clauses  
remain to be worked out -- and Owens' agent, David Joseph, is 
expected to come to the team's Santa Clara headquarters later this 
week to finalize it. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner, a former first-round pick of the Philadelphia Eagles,  
played in 10 games with three starts last season, rushing 96 times 
for 381 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	He was among three free-agent backs worked out last week by the  
49ers. Lawrence Phillips and Harvey Williams were the others. The 
49ers also visited with former Washington running back Terry Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst, whose game-breaking running style made him San  
Francisco's top offensive threat last season, hasn't been able to 
take part in the team's offseason workouts because of his slow 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	He was injured on the first play from scrimmage during San  
Francisco's loss at Atlanta in the NFC title game last January, his 
leg twisting grotesquely at the ankle when it grabbed on the 
artificial turf. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers medical personnel believe a circulation problem has  
arisen near Hearst's ankle, depriving bones in the area of a 
sufficient blood supply. If the condition, diagnosed as avascular 
necrosis, isn't alleviated, the affected bones could die. A similar 
problem in Bo Jackson's hip forced him to quit football. He 
continued playing baseball despite undergoing hip-replacement 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst, who had four touchdown runs of 70 or more yards last  
season, including a team-record 96-yarder in overtime, met Tuesday 
in New York with Dr. Bill Hamilton. He's also scheduled to fly to 
Birmingham, Ala., where he will consult with another leading 
orthopedic specialist, Dr. James Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst did get some encouraging news in his visit Monday with  
Seattle doctor Pierce Scranton. 
</P>
<P>
	Scranton believes a relatively minor procedure aimed at  
stimulating blood flow to the ankle could allow Hearst to return to 
football in eight to 10 weeks. Even under that scenario, Hearst 
would miss more than a month of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 49ers are cautiously optimistic about Hearst, they  
also moved ahead with plans to shore up their running back corps. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers lost Hearst's backup, Terry Kirby, when he signed with  
Cleveland. San Francisco added former Green Bay running back Travis 
Jervy but he, too, is coming off an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh was most taken with the workout by Phillips, the troubled  
NFL washout who again is drawing interest from teams after being 
named offensive MVP for NFL Europe. Phillips hasn't played in the 
NFL since 1997 and remains subject to suspension for violating the 
league's violent-crime policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers still have some interest in Phillips, who has a  
meeting scheduled Wednesday with commissioner Paul Tagliabue to 
discuss the parameters of his potential return to the league.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The New York Times Co. replaced Boston Globe  
publisher Benjamin B. Taylor, whose family had overseen the paper 
for 126 years, because of a ``difference in approach to 
management,'' a Globe spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's successor, effective immediately, is Richard H. Gilman,  
a New York Times senior vice president. Taylor remains chairman of 
the Globe Newspaper Company Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Sulzberger Jr., chairman of The New York Times Co., which  
owns the Globe, said Gilman would bring ``vision and leadership'' 
to the Globe, adding, ``Under Rich, The Globe will remain the voice 
of New England.'' 
</P>

	The Times bought the Globe in 1993 in a $1.1 billion deal that  
guaranteed the Globe independence in news and management for at 
least five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Globe spokesman Richard Gulla said Taylor's ouster did not  
signal the end of that independence. He declined to elaborate 
beyond his comment about management differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Globe will remain editorially autonomous,'' Gulla said  
Monday. ``It is not in any way going to become an arm of The New 
York Times or anything like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move came as a shock to Globe staffers and even to Gilman,  
who told the newsroom in a noon meeting Monday that ``this catches 
a lot of people, including myself, a little bit by surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though such a move had been rumored in the industry since the  
Times bought the Globe, officials from both papers said no other 
major changes -- including layoffs -- were planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no other shoe to drop,'' Gilman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Editor Matthew Storin was quoted by The Washington Post in  
Tuesday's editions as saying Gilman and Sulzberger had ``made it 
clear they not only wanted me to stay but hoped I would stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While it's a jarring change, and you can't expect them to have  
the emotional connection the Taylor family has, I have faith that 
they have our best interests at heart,'' Storin told the Post. 
</P>
<P>
	John Morton, media consultant and columnist for the American  
Journalism Review, said the Times likely wanted a Globe publisher 
with more experience on the business and management side. 
</P>
<P>
	``The paper is now controlled by the Sulzberger family, and it's  
inevitable that The Boston Globe ... is eventually going to be run 
by people who are in The New York Times' culture,'' Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they've been very respectful of the Taylor family,''  
he added. ``But clearly it is now a Sulzberger newspaper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sulzberger praised Taylor, whose family has led the publication  
for four generations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ben Taylor has made many important contributions to the Globe  
during the past 27 years. His commitment to the newspaper, service 
to the community and dedication to quality journalism are 
unquestioned,'' Sulzberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting of department heads, William O. Taylor -- Benjamin  
Taylor's cousin, who retired in 1997 after 20 years as publisher -- 
said the appointment of Gilman was the end of an era for his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very sad day for both Ben and myself as our family  
winds up a long career managing this newspaper,'' he said. ``I hope 
the history books will be kind to both of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman, 48, has been senior vice president of operations for the  
Times since 1993. He has, at various times, overseen production, 
systems and technology, the development of plant facilities and 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	He started his career as a reporter at The Arizona Daily Star in  
Tucson. During his tenure there, the paper won its first Pulitzer 
Prize in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Times, Gilman is credited with overseeing the newspaper's  
largest circulation growth since 1992. He also introduced color 
printing to the newspaper's weekday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, 52, has been with the Globe since 1972 and was named  
publisher in 1997. Before becoming publisher, he was a general 
assignment and political reporter, assistant business editor, 
assistant managing editor for local news and executive editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he was named chairman and chief executive officer of  
the Globe Newspaper Company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bit of a sad day, I have to admit,'' Taylor said. ``But  
I'm focused on looking forward.''

<HEADLINE> Assault Weapons Attacked in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California lawmakers have passed a  
measure that supporters say blocks gunmakers from evading a 
10-year-old ban on assault weapons by simply changing the names of 
the high-powered firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure approved Monday by the state's Assembly and Senate  
ends 2 1/2 years of legislative wrangling over so-called copycat 
weapons that sprung up following passage of California's assault 
weapons ban in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis is expected to sign the current bill as well as  
another already on his desk that would limit gun purchases to one a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill closes the loophole that bans guns by name, not by  
capacity,'' said Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current law, California generally prohibits the sale,  
manufacture, distribution, import and, in many instances, 
possession of more than 50 military-style weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	But it has not prohibited gunmakers from selling guns with  
slight modifications under different names. While the TEC-9 is 
banned, for example, the TEC-DC9, one of the weapons used in the 
Littleton, Colo., massacre, has been legal in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The approved bill spells out physical characteristics of the  
weapons already outlawed -- such as fixed magazines that carry more 
than 10 rounds of ammunition, vertical handgrips and other features 
that allow rapid firing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature last year passed a similar bill, but it was  
vetoed by then-Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	California's initial weapons ban was enacted after a man armed  
with an AK-47 assault rifle killed five children and wounded 
several others at a Stockton elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
	While supporters say Monday's action tightens the law,  
opponents, most of them Republicans, said the measure wouldn't 
reduce gun violence or stop criminals from getting weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It accomplishes nothing,'' said Republican Assemblyman George  
House. ``If you want to stop these killings, put more morality back 
in the public school curriculum, put more morality back into 
teachings in the home.''

<HEADLINE> ESPN Will Replay World Cup Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. women's victory in the World Cup final  
was worth a second look, ESPN decided, especially for non-baseball 
fans in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable network replaced its taped Rock N' Roll gymnastics  
show from 1998 with a replay of the Americans' shootout victory 
over China after a 0-0 tie Sunday afternoon. It aired Tuesday night 
opposite the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	The replay wasn't expected to attract 40 million viewers as it  
did the first time around on ABC, but should have drawn many 
viewers still caught up in the aftermath of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	There was speculation that ESPN went head-to-head with the  
All-Star game because of its court dispute with Major League 
Baseball. But the cable network described its decision as nothing 
more than counter-programming. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to show it on ESPN on prime time while it was still  
fresh and this was our first opportunity to do so,'' ESPN spokesman 
Josh Krulewitz said. ``Any other theory may sound like a great 
story, but it's simply fiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN aired the Home Run Derby Monday night, will show the WNBA  
All-Star game on Wednesday night and has committed to showing taped 
coverage of the British Open on Thursday and Friday in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
	MLB terminated its contract with ESPN in June over the switch of  
three September games to a secondary outlet, and after ESPN sued, 
baseball countersued. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's decision to broadcast the World Cup match didn't seem to  
bother Fox, which televised the All-Star game and has been a major 
rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's their decision,'' Fox spokesman Vince Wladika said. ``God  
bless them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball also didn't seem fazed.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're in charge of their own programming,'' baseball  
spokesman Rich Levin said. ``It wasn't live action last I saw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star game posted a 13.3 national rating last year, up 13  
percent from 1997. The World Cup final had a surprising 11.4 
preliminary national mark. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans' victory was the most-watched soccer game on U.S.  
network television. The match will also air on ESPN Classic on 
Sunday at 5 p.m. EDT.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Reach Steel Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and Russian trade negotiators struck a  
last-minute deal in which Russia agreed to limit steel shipments to 
the United States for five years to avoid punitive tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration on Tuesday hailed the agreement as a  
good compromise that will protect the U.S. industry from unfair 
import surges while not shutting off America's market to 
economically troubled countries such as Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	But a coalition of steel companies protested the pact, which  
will avert punitive tariffs of as much as 184 percent on Russian 
hot-rolled steel. The Russian agreement followed a similar deal the 
administration reached last week with Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``The steel crisis is not over,'' the five steel companies,  
including Bethlehem Steel and U.S. Steel, said in a joint 
statement. ``Suspending trade cases in instances where unfair trade 
has caused serious injury directly undermines the effectiveness and 
credibility of U.S. trade laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley told reporters, ``These  
agreements deliver on the administration's commitment to guarantee 
that surging imports do not threaten the livelihoods of communities 
and workers around the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deals, which were signed after marathon negotiations in  
Paris, will set annual quotas for Russian steel over the next five 
years. For 1999, total shipments will be 64 percent below the highs 
reached last year when the global financial crisis caused foreign 
steel shipments to the United States to soar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian quotas will gradually rise over the next four years,  
climbing to 725,000 metric tons for hot rolled steel in 2003, the 
department said. That would still represent an 80 percent reduction 
from the 1998 level of imports of Russian hot rolled steel, U.S. 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley gave credit to Vice President Al Gore, who telephoned  
Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin twice on Monday as 
negotiators struggled to break a logjam before a midnight deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday  
in Nebraska, Gore said, ``We got an agreement that is going to 
provide predictability in our steel industry, a sharply reduced 
level of Russian imports. ... It's going to help them and it's 
going to help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, which is counting on strong union  
support to help keep the White House in Democratic hands, has been 
searching for ways to help U.S. industries being battered by a 
surge in imports that have sent America's trade deficit to record 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the same time, the administration has said it will not  
support blatant protectionist measures that would be violate World 
Trade Organization trading rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Senate killed a House-passed bill that would  
have imposed global quotas on steel imports, a measure the 
administration had pledged to veto, saying it would put the United 
States in violation of WTO rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is considering a package of proposals to  
provide greater assistance to the U.S. steel industry, which has 
been forced to lay off thousands of workers because of the surge of 
imports from a number of nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said the administration's proposals, which could include  
an international conference to pressure countries to stop 
subsidizing their steel industries, should be announced by the end 
of this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Trade Minister Mikhail Fradkov, quoted by the Russian  
news agency Itar-Tass, said the steel agreement represented a ``a 
sufficiently difficult compromise for both sides, but for Russia it 
preserves an opportunity to supply steel to the American market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quota agreement was a refinement of a preliminary deal the  
two nations had announced back in February. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final plan, U.S. officials said quotas for hot-rolled and  
cold-rolled steel were reduced over the five-year period from the 
levels that had been agreed to in February while quotas for other 
types of steel such as steel bars were raised. 
</P>
<P>
	High tariffs have been imposed in a case involving hot-rolled  
steel with Japan. But Russia and Brazil both avoided the tariffs by 
entering into negotiations for ``voluntary'' restraints on their 
shipments to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	William Klinefelter, a lobbyist for the United Steelworkers  
Union, said his union still would like to see Congress or the 
administration deal in a comprehensive way with the problem of 
steel imports. But he gave Gore credit for persuading Russia to 
drop their objections to covering all types of steel in the deal 
announced Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Space Museum Head Dies in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINDEN, Nev. (AP) -- The head of the Smithsonian Institution's  
National Air and Space Museum was killed Tuesday when the glider he 
was in broke apart and crashed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed along with Donald Engen, 75, was William Ivans, an  
internationally known pilot from La Jolla, Calif., who was piloting 
the motorized glider. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the crash was under investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's Sgt. Lance Modispacher said witnesses reported seeing  
the glider breaking apart at about 11,000 feet and falling to the 
ground near a dirt road. There were no apparent weather 
disturbances at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The area is a mecca for glider pilots because of wind conditions  
that allow for long, high-altitude flights, but it can be difficult 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same conditions that produce world-class gliding can  
challenge you as well,'' said Larry Sanderson, president of the 
Soaring Society of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Engen had been director of the National Air and Space Museum in  
Washington since 1996. He also was administrator of the Federal 
Aviation Administration from 1984 to 1987, and earlier served for 
two years on the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	A much-decorated Navy pilot, Engen retired as a vice admiral in  
1978. He also was a test pilot for many years and had served as 
general manager of Piper Aircraft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	He took over as head of the Air and Space Museum after his  
predecessor, Martin Harwit, resigned in May 1995. Harwit left amid 
criticism that a planned Enola Gay-atomic bomb exhibit would have 
depicted the United States as the aggressor and Japan as the victim 
of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Air and Space is one of 16 museums and galleries operated by the  
Smithsonian Institution, and is the most visited museum in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	At the FAA, Engen levied a series of fines against airlines,  
including a $9.5 million penalty against Eastern Airlines for 
alleged safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Engen also revised the way the FAA kept track of near-collision  
reports to make it more accurate. But critics said that under 
Engen, the FAA continued to react to safety issues instead of being 
on top of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Engen, who lived in Arlington, Va., was married and had four  
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Engen and Ivans, 79, were top officers in the Soaring  
Society of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivans was considered a soaring pioneer who had won top soaring  
awards for high-altitude flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanderson said both victims were top pilots in ``an extremely  
well-built aircraft. So it had to be a very unusual set of 
circumstances that stressed the aircraft.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Called 'Stuffed Shirt' in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Calling Vice President Al Gore a ``stuffed  
shirt,'' a powerful county Democratic leader in New York says Bill 
Bradley is ``more electable'' in the presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	While stopping short of an outright endorsement of the former  
New Jersey senator's bid for the Democratic nomination, David 
Alpert of Westchester County said Monday that while he could ``live 
with either ... I think Bradley is the more exciting candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're putting together a whole package, I think he's  
more electable,'' Alpert said. ``I think Gore is a great guy, but I 
think he's -- I'm probably using the wrong word -- a stuffed shirt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alpert said he hoped to make an endorsement in the presidential  
race before the end of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Westchester is the state's eighth largest of 62 counties in  
terms of Democratic enrollment, with 210,000 party members. It is 
located just north of New York City and is considered one of the 
linchpins to success in the politically crucial suburbs surrounding 
the city in statewide campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Gore, Chris Lehane, said: ``We're very pleased  
with the depth and breadth of our support throughout New York and 
we'll continue working to make that support even broader and 
deeper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, much of the state's top Democratic Party leadership,  
including more than a half dozen of the state's most powerful 
county chairmen have already lined up behind Gore in New York. Also 
supporting the vice president's candidacy are state Comptroller H. 
Carl McCall, state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and state 
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Saturday, top Gore advisers in New York said they  
expected Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan to back Bradley. Moynihan has 
had no comment on that. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore advisers said this weekend they were also concerned they  
might lose Dominic Baranello, a former state party chairman, to the 
Bradley camp.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen early Wednesday,  
while Japanese stocks rose moderately amid expectations for Japan's 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.34 yen in early trading, down 0.80 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but slightly above its late New York 
level of 121.32 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 63.81  
points, or 0.35 percent, to 18,244.90 in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Tuesday, the average closed down 0.42 points, or 0.03 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved marginally from its late  
New York level in the absence of fresh market-moving news. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the market still held some fear of another round of  
Bank of Japan dollar-buying intervention, which could stem the 
greenback's slide. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the Bank of Japan intervened to stop the yen's  
rise against the dollar, an action seen taken to help the country's 
economy recover from its worst recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.30 yen, down  
from 123.64 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices opened modestly higher on some  
hopes that Japan's economy will continue to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Economic Planning Agency said in its latest  
monthly report that the nation's economy is improving somewhat, 
with private consumption recovering and the effects of government 
support steps sinking in. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell  
25.96 points to 11,175.02. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 5.56 points, or 0.37 percent, to 1,489.25. The 
TOPIX closed down 0.42 points, or 0.03 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.6250 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.6000 percent, driving 
its price down to 101.52 yen from 101.74 yen.

<HEADLINE> Coke Europe Recall Cost May Be $103M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The largest bottler of Coca-Cola beverages  
estimates that last month's European recall of its products will 
cost $103 million, far higher than its initial $60 million 
prediction. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. said Monday that the  
recall involved 17 million cases instead of the previously 
announced 14 million cases. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 249 people in Belgium, many of them children, were  
sickened June 9 after drinking Coke products. The health scare 
spread to several other European countries, which imposed full or 
partial sales bans on Coca-Cola products. The bans have since been 
rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke officials blamed the sicknesses on tainted carbon dioxide  
used in some of the products, as well as a fungicide on wooden 
pallets used to transport cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises, which made its cost estimate  
after stock market closed Monday, fell in morning trading today but 
were unchanged at $30.75 a share by this afternoon on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Co. holds a 40 percent stake of Coca-Cola Enterprises,  
which owns and runs the two plants in France and Belgium blamed for 
the illnesses. Coke was off 56 1/4 cents at $62.50 a share this 
afternoon on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. expect Coca-Cola  
Enterprises to earn 22 cents per share when it reports quarterly 
earnings July 20, excluding the recall's nonrecurring charge. That 
cost would reduce earnings another 16 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Schimberg, president and CEO of the bottler, said the  
recall would not affect financial results ``in the year 2000 and 
beyond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, Coca-Cola shareholders began receiving a  
letter from Coke Chairman M. Douglas Ivester reassuring investors 
that the company is committed to making quality products. Ivester's 
letter said the quality problems in Europe created an ``off taste'' 
and ``off smell,'' but did not constitute a health hazard.

<HEADLINE> Ruling in Genital Mutilation Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal appeals court has blocked the  
deportation of an African woman who sought asylum out of fear her 
tribe would mutilate her genitals or kill her for losing her 
virginity. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday that Adelaide  
Abankwah's fears were credible and that U.S. immigration officials 
should not have denied her request. The case now returns to the 
Board of Immigration Appeals, which is expected to issue a ruling 
in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Abankwah, 29, was detained in New York in 1997 after fleeing  
her 400-member tribe in Ghana. She told immigration officials that 
she feared village leaders would order her genitals mutilated or 
kill her because she had lost her virginity. 
</P>
<P>
	An immigration judge denied her request for asylum, saying her  
testimony was not detailed enough. But Monday, the appeals court 
said her claims were ``compelling in light of the general 
conditions present in Ghana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court noted that although Ghana outlawed genital mutilation  
in 1994, there have been only seven arrests since then and Ghanaian 
women continue to be forced to undergo the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Abankwah's lawyer, Jonathan Rauchway, said he will petition  
the Immigration and Naturalization Service to release her 
immediately.

<HEADLINE> United States 2, Derby County 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Eddie Lewis and Ben Olsen scored in the second  
half to give the U.S. men's soccer team a 2-1 victory over Derby 
County Club of the English Premier League on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsen broke a 1-1 tie in the 76th minute, sending a perfectly  
timed header past goalkeeper Mart Pool from 18 feet out. Lewis had 
tied the game in the 64th minute, scoring on a rebound after a shot 
by Ernie Stewart was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Sturridge scored the only goal for Derby County, which is  
using an 11-day tour of the United States to get in shape for its 
1999-2000 season, which begins Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Derby County hit two crossbars and a goal post in the second  
half. 
</P>
<P>
	Derby County led 1-0 at the half on Sturridge's goal in the 26th  
minute. Sturridge ran a give-and-go play with Darryl Powell and 
sent the return pass over goalkeeper Brad Friedel's left shoulder 
from 15 feet out. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Bravo had a good scoring chance moments after Sturridge's  
goal, but Pool made a diving stop of the 20-foot shot. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the U.S. team's final tuneup for the Confederation Cup,  
which runs July 24-Aug. 4 in Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Continue Falll / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices resumed their  
slide early today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for 
beneficial growing weather. 
</P>
<P>
	After a one-day breather that saw prices rise amid concern about  
dry weather, prices continued lower today on the National Weather 
Service's forecast for above-normal rainfall over the next 10 days. 
That will be accompanied by normal temperatures, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such conditions are near-ideal growing weather for  
spring-planted crops and help reinforce ideas that production this 
year will be large. The government currently is forecasting a third 
record year of soybean production and the third-largest corn crop 
on record. 
</P>
<P>
	The winter wheat harvest also is set to wrap up shortly, and is  
much larger than originally expected. 
</P>
<P>
	While overseas demand has picked up, ample world inventories are  
likely to translate to much lower asking prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 1 cent to $2.59 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1 cent to $1.95 3/4 a bushel; December oats fell 1 
cent to $1.08 a bushel; November soybeans fell 3 cents to $4.15 3/4 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were mostly lower on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while pork futures fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .15 cent to 63.65 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .05 cent to 77.42 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell 1.57 cents to 44.40 cents a pound; August pork bellies 
fell .75 cnet to 32.12 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> More Graves Found Under S.C. Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Volunteers were expected to work through  
the week retrieving the remains of Confederate sailors from 
underneath The Citadel's football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Archaeologists in recent weeks have found 16 bodies under  
Johnson Hagood Stadium, built atop an old sailors' cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, three graves and indications of five more were found  
beneath a room where school football boosters usually enjoy lunch 
and refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers hope two of the graves contain the remains of  
crewmen who died when the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley sank at 
its moorings during a test run in 1863. The following year, the 
vessel was refloated with another crew and became the first 
submarine to sink an enemy warship, the Union blockade ship 
Housatonic. 
</P>
<P>
	Five sailors drowned when the Hunley sank and four are thought  
to have been buried at the cemetery. Their graves are distinguished 
from the others because they were buried in oversized coffins after 
their bodies were dismembered to remove them from the submarine. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhumed remains of all the sailors will be reburied in the  
city's Magnolia Cemetery this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The three graves confirmed Monday contained intact bodies, but  
none appear to be those of the Hunley crew, said Randy Burbage, 
chairman of the Confederate Heritage Trust and a member of the 
state Hunley Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The five other apparent graves have ``the proper features, but  
you don't know exactly what they are, of course, until you get to 
the bottom,'' said Jon Leader, deputy state archaeologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Confederate sailors were buried at the site when it was the  
city's cemetery for seamen. The site was covered over in 1948 when 
a 21,000-seat stadium was built at the state military college.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Blocks Gun Control Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats renewed their push for gun  
control on Tuesday but their efforts to attach fresh restrictions 
to a routine spending bill were blocked by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	However, House GOP Whip Tom DeLay said Republican leaders were  
preparing to begin formal House-Senate compromise talks on gun 
control by next week, and all but promised that some of the 
Democratic proposals would be part of a final compromise on 
separate legislation. ``I'm almost positive,'' he said as he 
labored to keep the spending bill free of gun-related amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals, defeated by the House Appropriations Committee,  
would have required safety devices to be sold with handguns and 
banned the importation of certain high-capacity ammunition clips. 
Both provisions were approved by the House earlier this year, but 
died when the underlying measure was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
	The third defeated Democratic amendment would have expanded  
requirements for background checks for sales at gun shows. It was 
rejected by the full House in the earlier debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control was propelled to the top of the political agenda in  
the wake of the April shootings at a Colorado high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of us feel so strongly about this issue that we're going  
to use every avenue available to us,'' said Rep. Nita Lowey, 
D-N.Y., as she and two other Democrats sought to attach the 
provisions to a bill funding the Treasury Department, the Postal 
Service and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage of the bill by the committee came on a voice vote, but  
only after Republicans pushed through $240 million in cuts to meet 
the demands of conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	On another issue, passage signaled a desire by lawmakers of both  
parties to raise the current congressional salary of $136,700 by 
$4,600 annually, beginning next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal law, congressional pay rises annually unless the  
increase is blocked by legislation. Historically, the spending bill 
for the Treasury Department has been used as a vehicle for blocking 
the increases. The issue never arose during the day's drafting 
session at the Appropriations Committee, meaning the way remains 
clear for the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The companion Senate measure is likewise silent on the issue.  
</P>
<P>
	The gun control amendments were doomed from the start, but were  
advanced by Democrats as part of a strategy to press Republicans as 
often as possible on an issue that polls well with the public. 
</P>
<P>
	White House-backed gun control legislation cleared the Senate  
earlier in the year. It failed in the House when Democrats rejected 
the legislation as too weak, and Republicans opposed it for being 
too restrictive on guns. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay, R-Texas, a member of the Appropriations Committee,  
attended the panel's drafting session only long enough to 
participate in the debate related to guns. He departed as soon as 
it was clear his side would prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that despite delays, House and Senate leaders would  
begin formal negotiations soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said they weren't backing down.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we have an opportunity to take common sense steps to  
protect children from gun violence,'' said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, 
D-Conn., arguing for passage of the provision relating to safety 
locks. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal for background checks was rejected on a vote of  
24-35. The two other proposals fell on generally party-line votes 
of 24-34.

<HEADLINE> Newsmagazines, Movies Top Nielsens / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Newsmagazines and movies -- instead of  
previously-seen comedies and dramas -- were popular summertime fare 
for network television viewers last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tuesday edition of ``Dateline NBC,'' which featured a story  
on a woman accused of attacking her husband, was the week's 
top-rated program. CBS' ``60 Minutes'' narrowly came in second. 
</P>
<P>
	Four newsmagazines and three movies filled Nielsen Media  
Research's top 10. ABC's Monday movie, ``She Woke Up Pregnant,'' 
topped the feature film chart. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS won the week with a 6.6 rating and 13 share. NBC was second  
with a 5.8 rating and 11 share, ABC had a 5.7 rating and 11 share 
and Fox was at 4.4 and 9. The WB had a 2.3 rating and 4 share, UPN 
had a 1.4 rating and 3 share and Pax TV was at 0.7 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB was heartened by the ratings for its new comedy, ``Movie  
Stars.'' It scored the highest rating for the network in its Sunday 
time slot since last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the poor ratings for back-to-back episodes of  
``Suddenly Susan'' on July 5 had to depress NBC: The two shows had 
fewer viewers than anything else last week on ABC, CBS or NBC. 
``Suddenly Susan'' is coming back next fall in revamped form. In 
NBC's defense, Monday was a holiday for many viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
6.8 rating and 16 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 6.7 
rating and 16 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 5.9 and 
14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of July 5-11, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 9.3; ``60 Minutes,'' 
CBS, 9.2; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 8.7; ``ABC Monday Night Movie: She Woke

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Sign Steel Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia has agreed to limit shipments of steel  
to the United States over a five-year period to avoid imposition of 
punitive American tariffs, Commerce Secretary William Daley 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	``These agreements deliver on the administration's commitment to  
guarantee that surging imports do not threaten the livelihoods of 
communities and workers around the nation,'' Daley told reporters 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides signed the agreements covering different types of  
steel following marathon bargaining talks in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said that final obstacles were overcome with the help of  
phone calls from Vice President Al Gore to Russian Prime Minister 
Sergei Stepashin Monday afternoon and again late Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who is hoping to succeed President Clinton in the White  
House, had provided ``forceful advocacy on behalf of the U.S. steel 
industry and workers (that) was critical to the successful 
completion of these agreements,'' Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deals will set annual quotas for Russian steel shipments,  
reducing imports for all Russian steel shipments by 64 percent this 
year compared to 1998, the Commerce Department said in a fact 
sheet. 
</P>
<P>
	The quotas will gradually rise over the four years, climbing to  
a high of 725,000 metric tons for hot rolled steel in 2003, the 
department said. That would still represent an 80 percent reduction 
from the 1998 level of imports of Russian hot rolled steel, U.S. 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Tass news agency quoted Russian Trade Minister Mikhail  
Fradkov as saying the deal would preserve Russia's access to the 
U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement represents ``a sufficiently difficult compromise  
for both sides, but for Russia it preserves an opportunity to 
supply steel to the American market,'' Fradkov was quoted as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Fradkov told the Russian news agency that the deal was achieved  
only at the last minute following a number of concessions from the 
American side. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry and its supporters in Congress had been  
unhappy with the outline of the preliminary agreement the 
administration struck with Russia on steel back in February. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., had complained that  
the initial deal, which has now been modified with further 
negotiations, ``allows too much (Russian) steel to be imported at 
too low of a price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With political pressures rising, the administration has tried to  
show support for the U.S. steel industry. The industry has been 
hurt by a flood of cheap imports into the country following the 
global currency crisis, which sharply lowered demand for steel and 
other commodities because of the steep recessions in many Asian 
nations and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel industry has filed a number of dumping cases seeking  
to get the government to impose high tariffs to stem this tide of 
cheap foreign steel into the country. 
</P>
<P>
	High tariffs have been imposed in a case involving hot-rolled  
steel with Japan. But Russia entered into negotiations to avoid 
having the tariffs, which the industry favors because they are more 
effective at halting imports. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of Clinton administration officials argued that an  
agreement should be reached by which Russia could still ship steel 
to the United States as a way of helping that country out of its 
economic troubles. Steel is one of Russia's major industries, 
accounting for 7 percent of total economic output.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Company Buys Corporate Express </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOMFIELD, Colo. (AP) -- The acquisition of the Colorado-based  
Corporate Express by the Dutch company Buhrmann NV will create the 
world's biggest distributor of office supplies to companies and 
could pave the way for future takeovers, executives said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be the No. 1 business-to-business provider in North  
America, Europe and Australia,'' Robert King, president and CEO of 
the Corporate Express, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The $2.3 billion acquisition, which is expected to close in the  
fourth quarter, was announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new combined company will have sales of over $9 billion with  
operations in 28 countries and 30,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to taking over Corporate Express' $1.2 billion debt,  
Buhrmann will pay $9.70 in cash for every share of Corporate 
Express, for a total of $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined entity will generate cost savings of $100 million  
per year, executives from both companies said at a press conference 
held at Corporate Express' headquarters in Broomfield, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the companies have a customer base of about 170,000  
customers, including more than 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger comes just five months after Corporate Express'  
founder stepped aside as chairman and the company announced plans 
to conduct a comprehensive review of its business operations. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, shares of the company had fallen 30 percent in the  
past year as weakness in its delivery business dragged down 
earnings growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were also critical that Corporate Express lost  
direction and its focus on operating profitably when it started 
buying up smaller companies, acquiring its $1.2 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Buhrmann said the acquisition, which will see a merger of  
Buhrmann's North America operations based in Chicago with Corporate 
Express, would have little impact on jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate Express stock rose 47 cents on Tuesday to $9.03 on the  
Nasdaq Stock Market. Buhrmann shares jumped 18 percent on the 
Amsterdam Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Dutch business services and  
distribution group Buhrmann NV today announced the acquisition of 
U.S.-based Corporate Express for $2.3 billion, creating what it 
called the world's largest distributor of office supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dutch company will pay $9.70 in cash for every share of  
Corporate Express, a provider of office and computer supplies based 
in Broomfield, Colo. The new combination will have sales of more 
than $9 billion, with operations in 28 countries and 30,000 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The acquisition of Corporate Express strongly advances  
Buhrmann's strategy to become the world's premier office products 
distributor in the business-to-business market, and we expect that 
it will create significant value for our shareholders,'' said Frans 
Koffrie, chief executive officer of Buhrmann. 
</P>
<P>
	The office products activities will now be Buhrmann's largest  
business. It also has paper selling activities and graphic systems 
operations in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the companies have a customer base of about 170,000  
customers, including more than 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate Express founder Jirka Rysavy announced in February he  
was stepping down as chairman of the office supply company, whose 
investors had accused it of losing direction after it started 
buying up smaller companies and acquiring debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Buhrmann said today it would pay $1.1 billion for the Corporate  
Express shares, and take on $1.2 billion in debts, which it plans 
to refinance.

<HEADLINE> New Weapon Against Cranberry Pests / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Who knew sex could be such a powerful weapon  
against hungry cranberry-eating pests? 
</P>
<P>
	A new pest-fighting weapon interferes with the moths' mating  
rituals, resulting in fewer of the dreaded Sparganothis fruitworm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moths are going to have to take lots of cold showers,'' said  
Jeffrey LaFleur, executive director of the Cape Cod Cranberry 
Growers' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	With 14,400 acres of bogs, Massachusetts is the second-largest  
producer of cranberries in the nation, producing 1.8 million 
barrels a season. Wisconsin produces 2.5 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	The fruitworms can be devastating to a cranberry crop, infesting  
and destroying up to 50 percent of a bog in a bad year. They burrow 
into the fruit, munching their way from one to the next, rendering 
the cranberry useless as food or drink. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest antiworm device uses the insect's own pheromones,  
which control sexual desire, to lead the bug astray. 
</P>
<P>
	Moths mate around this time of year, producing eggs that turn  
into the worms that feast on cranberries between late summer and 
early autumn. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists were able to replicate the pheromones released by the  
female moths to attract males for mating. The pheromones have been 
bottled in liquid form, for all practical reasons an insect 
perfume. 
</P>
<P>
	The liquid is then mixed into a cranberry bog's irrigation  
system, sending the moths into a blind sexual tizzy. 
</P>
<P>
	The males smell the females, but because the scent is  
everywhere, they can't find the potential partners (unless, of 
course, they are fortunate enough to bump into one). 
</P>
<P>
	The result: fewer eggs are laid, and that translates into fewer  
of the berry-eating worms, said LaFleur, who sounds positively 
gleeful as he discusses the insect's demise. 
</P>
<P>
	Where the pheromones leave off, the worms' predators -- such as  
wasps -- take over. LaFleur predicts the fruitworm could disappear 
from Massachusetts cranberry bogs over several years. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, a handful of growers are testing out the pheromone  
on several hundred acres of Massachusetts bogs. 
</P>
<P>
	The product is nontoxic to other species and to humans, said  
LaFleur, whose organization represents about 80 percent of the 
cranberry growers in the state. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	HAYS, Kan. (AP) -- A smaller wheat crop in northwest Kansas,  
combined with dismal prices, means trouble for many farmers here 
who were hit hard by hail before the harvest began. 
</P>
<P>
	And even in southwest Kansas, where the harvest was more  
bountiful, many farmers are opting to sell at low prices rather 
than store their crops. 
</P>
<P>
	At Garden City, the Johnson Co-op is already full and piling  
grain on the ground -- with corn harvest expected in just 60 days. 
The elevator has been shipping grain for storage to terminals in 
Kansas City, said grain accountant Jerry Popejoy. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have already sold 25 percent of their grain at the  
Johnson Co-op, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scott Co-op in Scott City has also seen heavy selling, with  
farmers there selling 20 percent of their harvest rather than store 
it in hopes that prices will improve. 
</P>
<P>
	Junior Strecker, general manager of the Scott Co-op, said  
farmers are selling so much because of loan deficiency payments. 
There are no incentives to hold the grain.

<HEADLINE> Girl Has Half Her Brain Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Surgeons removed half of a teen-age girl's  
brain on Tuesday in hopes of stemming the spread of a deadly 
neurological disease that racked her body with seizures and was 
eating away at her brain. 
</P>
<P>
	The left side of Amber Ramirez's brain -- the side that controls  
speech and fine motor movements -- was removed in a 12-hour 
operation at Johns Hopkins Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery may leave Amber without the ability to speak, but  
she didn't want to live with the rare Rasmussen's disease any 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the surgery, the Lincoln, Neb., girl faced the  
possibility of mental retardation, paralysis and even death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived all my life with seizures,'' Amber said before her  
operation. ``I'm tired of having to put up with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amber and her mother, Sheri Ramirez, knew that at 15 she was  
considered old for the procedure. Dr. Benjamin Carson, her surgeon, 
said he was confident the procedure will work, though she will need 
years of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a bit older than most patients who had a hemispherectomy  
but she's certainly not the oldest patient we've operated on,'' he 
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber's disease began with a limp in 1993, when she was 9. She  
couldn't remember getting hurt, but her right foot ached. She was 
in a wheelchair two months later. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the seizures began, one each hour, pulling on her right leg  
and arm until she wanted to scream from the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	An Omaha doctor finally diagnosed Rasmussen's syndrome, which  
affects about 1,000 people worldwide. Medication and surgery to 
remove diseased snippets of brain tissue slowed the disease but 
could not stop it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rasmussen's syndrome eats away at one side of the brain like a  
PAC-Man,'' said Dr. John Freeman, director of the pediatric 
epilepsy program at Johns Hopkins Medical Center and another of 
Amber's doctors in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hemispherectomy, surgeons remove half of the brain,  
leaving the deep structures of the brain intact. Amber's doctors 
say her brain will try to compensate for what's missing. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a hemispherectomy, the other side of the brain picks up  
a lot of function,'' said Freeman. ``Intelligence and memory 
remain, but the patient will walk with a limp and will not be able 
to use their opposite hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amber will need years of rehabilitation.  
</P>
<P>
	``We know that it's just going to be a very long road,'' Ms.  
Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought a lot about the future when making our decision. We  
thought about Amber maybe being able to leave home and being 
independent,'' she said. ``Amber wanted to get rid of her seizures, 
to not have to have somebody walk two steps behind her all the 
time.''

<HEADLINE> Roche Sales Up 7 Pct. in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche's  
sales rose 7 percent in the first half, helped by demand for its 
new weight loss drug Xenical. 
</P>
<P>
	Roche said it also expects good results for the full year. Sales  
in the first half of 1999 were $8.5 billion, up from $7.9 billion 
in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	First-half profit, which will be announced at a later date,  
should be up from a year ago, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug sales overall rose 12 percent in the first half of 1999,  
which help make up for the 7 percent drop in sales of vitamins and 
fine chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Xenical, Roche's weight-control drug, was a major contributor to  
increased pharmaceutical sales, the company said. It did not 
disclose specific sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Roche's high expectations exclude special charges related to its  
involvement in a vitamins price-fixing scheme, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the U.S. Justice Department said Roche and BASF AG of  
Germany agreed to plead guilty and pay a record $725 million 
criminal fine for engaging in a worldwide conspiracy to raise and 
fix the prices of vitamins. Roche's share was $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The forecast also excludes the results of Roche's agreement to  
buy outstanding shares of U.S. biotech firm Genentech Inc. and then 
make a public offering to sell around 17 percent of the shares, 
Roche said.

<HEADLINE> More Hate Crime Legislation Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Civil rights leaders urged Americans to voice  
their concern about hate crimes to encourage Congress to expand 
federal civil rights protections. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is certainly an increase in the number of hate groups in  
the country, and there is a wide increase in the incidence of hate 
groups violence,'' Wade Henderson, director of the Leadership 
Council on Civil Rights, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 120 civil rights leaders joined at the White House in  
a Clinton administration-backed effort to build momentum for 
tougher protections. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act would allow the  
federal government to prosecute hate crimes sparked by sexual 
orientation, gender and disability, as well as give the Justice 
Department ``greater ability to prosecute hate crime in general,'' 
said Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant attorney general for civil 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Hate crimes are motivated by prejudice based on race, religion,  
color or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current law, the federal government may step in only if  
the crime in question occurred on federal property or during a 
federally protected activity, such as while a victim was voting or 
going to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are anxious to see it move. ... We're calling on all  
Americans to voice their concern'' about recent hate murders, 
Henderson added. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than half the states have hate crime laws that cover  
gender, sexual orientation and disability, according to Michael 
Lieberman of the Anti-Defamation League, who said the expanded law 
would work as a federal ``backstop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But few of the hate crimes tabulated by the FBI are motivated by  
sexual orientation, gender or disability, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1991, the FBI has tabulated almost 50,000 hate crimes, but  
of the indictments that resulted, only about 37 would fall under 
the proposed broader definition of hate crimes, Lieberman said.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Group Raps Liability Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A consumer group opposed to liability law reform  
said Tuesday that legislation has failed to lower the price of 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``States with little or no tort law restrictions have  
experienced the same level of insurance rates as those states that 
enacted severe restrictions on victims' rights,'' said the report 
released by Citizens for Corporate Accountability and Individual 
Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has battled efforts in Congress and state legislatures  
to limit lawsuits that sometimes yield jury awards in the millions 
of dollars for accidents tied to defective products. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for a property and casualty insurers group disputed  
the report's conclusions, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``The removal of tort reform would clearly raise costs,'' said  
Steven Goldstein of the Insurance Information Institute in New 
York. ``We are constantly litigated against.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report's release comes on the heels of the largest  
product-liability award ever issued. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a Los Angeles jury awarded a record $4.9 billion to  
six motorists who were severely burned when their Chevrolet 
exploded in a rear-end collision. General Motors Corp. plans to 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Authors J. Robert Hunter and Joanne Doroshow said that based on  
industry data, insurance costs that drive prices are not affected 
by legislation enacted by state lawmakers. The study looked at 
figures since the mid-1980s when liability insurance premiums 
skyrocketed and insurance was difficult to purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer group says 41 states have enacted legislation  
limiting liability to varying degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance industry seeks legislation that would reduce jury  
awards for claims of pain and suffering and to speed up litigation, 
Goldstein said. The industry's demands for smaller awards do not 
apply to medical costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is, if you can reduce the costs of litigiousness you  
can reduce costs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doroshow said industry officials are wrong, however, when they  
insist that all that's needed is to ``rein in these out-of-control 
juries and you'll see insurance premiums drop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not true. It's a big lie. It's a hoax,'' she said. ``It's  
being played out in state legislatures across the country. 
Lawmakers have been duped. The public has been duped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance rates already are ``near historic lows,'' according to  
Dan Zielinski, spokesman for the American Insurance Association in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Albanese, an analyst with industry rating company A.M.  
Best, attributed this to competition in home and auto insurance and 
a soft market for other insurance policies.

<HEADLINE> Sparky Anderson in Hospital for Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Former Detroit Tigers and Cincinnati Reds manager  
Sparky Anderson was hospitalized today for testing, including 
checks of heart function. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, 65, lives in Thousand Oaks, Calif., but was visiting  
here to play in a golf tournament, according to his friend, Dan 
Ewald. He was taken to Henry Ford Hospital on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was not feeling well. They're running tests on him. They  
are checking his heart,'' said Ewald, adding that Anderson had felt 
under the weather for more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson managed the Reds from 1970-78, winning championships in  
1975-76. He then managed the Tigers for 17 years, resigning after 
the 1995 season with a team-record 1,331 victories and a World 
Championship in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Engine Cracks Blamed in F-16 Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A special Air Force inspection program for a  
key component of F-16 jet engines failed to find cracks that led to 
two crashes this year, newly released reports found. 
</P>
<P>
	The crashes in February and March were traced to the jets'  
afterburner, which gives the planes a boost of power during takeoff 
or maneuvers. In both cases, the afterburner assembly fell apart in 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force was already keeping a close eye on the  
afterburners, which date to the 1980s, because of cracks that 
developed around spot welds in the metal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force has recorded 13 incidents of serious afterburner  
cracks since 1984, but until this year the problem caused no 
crashes of the $20 million jet fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	In the March 26 crash, the afterburner had very recently passed  
a special inspection, but the device failed after the plane flew 
just 18 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``The inspection procedures were ineffective,'' an Air Force  
report on the crash concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash report, released last week, said a lab analysis  
revealed 30 cracks in the afterburner wall. A similar report on the 
Feb. 3 crash noted 50 cracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Both crashes involved student pilots at Luke Air Force Base in  
Arizona. In both cases, fireballs engulfed the rear of the 
students' F-16s. The pilots ejected safely. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the crashes, the Air Force has asked Congress for $45  
million for an emergency replacement program. Starting next year, 
the aging afterburners on 767 Pratt &AMP; Whitney engines would be 
replaced with a newer version that does not use welds, said Air 
Force spokesman Gary Emery. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has not yet acted on the request.  
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the Air Force is using a fluorescent dye to  
highlight cracks that may not be visible otherwise, Emery said. The 
Air Force is also checking the afterburners more often -- after they 
have been fired 1,000 times instead of 2,000 times, Emery said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've halved the time between inspection, and increased the  
sensitivity of the inspection,'' Emery said. 
</P>
<P>
	Through mid-June, 712 engines had undergone the enhanced  
inspections, and the Air Force found 63 cases of cracked 
afterburners, Emery said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force has about 1,450 F-16s, which Emery praised as the  
safest single-engine jet the service has ever had.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Suspects Called Mild-Mannered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDDING, Calif. (AP) -- Before he moved away from his home in  
Northern California, Matt Williams painted a strange sign on a shed 
in his back yard: a triangle with a star, a human eye at the point 
and a cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Its meaning is a puzzle, one of many in the case of Williams,  
31, and his 29-year-old brother, Tyler, men described by 
acquaintances as bright, personable, devoted Christians -- and by 
investigators as suspects in the killing of a gay couple and, 
possibly, three synagogue fires. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were in jail Monday on charges of receiving stolen  
merchandise, which police say are connected to the slayings. They 
pleaded innocent and have not been charged in the deaths or with 
the Sacramento fires being investigated by federal authorities as a 
hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of it makes sense to me,'' said Charles Bond, a landlord  
in the college town of Moscow, Idaho, who knew Matt Williams while 
he attended school there. ``I always thought Matt was real 
levelheaded and a real nice kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Anderson, a teacher who bought the Williamses' Gridley  
home three years ago, has wondered anew about that symbol on the 
shed, which he says shows through even though he's painted over it 
a few times. He said Matt Williams painted it the day the family 
left for Redding. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a few years ago. The Williams brothers had never been  
arrested before this summer, when investigators say their quiet 
lives exploded into violence. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 1, Gary Matson and Winfield Mowder were found shot to  
death in their bed in Happy Valley, a community near Redding, an 
old Gold Rush town 215 miles northeast of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Wednesday, after one of Matson's credit cards was used,  
police staked out a Yuba City business where the credit card 
purchase was to be delivered. The Williams brothers were arrested 
as they picked up equipment to assemble ammunition, Yuba City 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	One was wearing a bulletproof vest, and both were armed with  
assault rifles, a shotgun and 9 mm pistols, police said. 
Authorities said the brothers were carrying Matson's wallet, his 
driver's license and his Social Security card. 
</P>
<P>
	The connection between victims and suspects? Apparently the  
gentle art of horticulture. 
</P>
<P>
	Mowder, 40, who had just earned a degree in anthropology from  
Chico State University, worked in the gardening department of a 
Redding hardware store. Matson, 50, was co-founder of a natural 
science museum and arboretum, and helped establish a farmers market 
where Matt Williams ran a booth, said Ed Smith, who owns a nursery 
where Williams worked for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Matson and Williams were ``friends as far as I could tell,''  
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators seeking a motive for the crime went to an  
apartment rented by Matt Williams and allegedly found a trove of 
white supremacist writings and guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they also found a notebook containing the names of  
32 Jewish and civic leaders associated with three Sacramento 
synagogues that were set ablaze last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Also among the pamphlets were handouts from the World Church of  
the Creator, an Illinois-based white supremacist group being 
scrutinized in the Sacramento synagogue fires, all set June 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the Fourth of July weekend, a former group member targeted  
minorities in a shooting rampage in Indiana and Illinois, killing 
two and wounding nine before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Hale, the leader of the World Church of the Creator,  
rejected any involvement with the Williams brothers and said 
attempts to link his group to crimes in California are part of a 
federal ``smear campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matt and Tyler Williams grew up in the farm town of Gridley,  
where they were home-schooled for a time, and later moved 120 miles 
north to Redding with their parents, who have declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said the father, Ben Williams, ``used to walk up and  
down the street carrying a staff and preaching to no one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends from Gridley remembered the two as mild-mannered, always  
ready to preach but not belligerent. 
</P>
<P>
	Erick Dahl remembers Tyler Williams as smart but reserved, a boy  
who earned the right to wear a gold cord at graduation because of 
his academic record. But he also was a student who ``didn't have a 
lot of really close friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember he talked a lot about religion but never to the  
point of trying to impose it on you,'' said Dahl, who played chess 
with Tyler over lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond said the same of Matt Williams: ``My impression is that he  
would have been very firm in his own political, religious 
convictions, but I could never see that leading to violence.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Negro League Star Kimbro Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Henry Kimbro, a Negro League outfielder  
known as the ``black Ty Cobb,'' has died at age 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimbro, who died Sunday, batted .320 over 18 seasons. He played  
from 1934 to 1951 for the Nashville Elite Giants, the Washington 
Elite Giants, the New York Black Yankees, the Baltimore Elite 
Giants and the Birmingham Black Barons. He hit .393 for Baltimore 
in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw him swing at the first pitch the whole time that I  
knew him,'' said Butch McCord of Nashville, who played with Kimbro 
on the 1949 Negro National League champion in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Walker, who operates the Old Negro League Baseball Shop in  
Nashville, said Kimbro played with Roy Campanella and against Negro 
League legends like Josh Gibson, Buck Leonard and Satchel Paige. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the greatest Negro League players that ever  
lived,'' Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	After his baseball career, Kimbro returned to his native  
Nashville and became a successful businessman, founding Bill's Cab 
taxi service which he ran for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He died at home after being in declining health for about a  
month. Survivors include his wife, three daughters, two sons and 
two sisters. Funeral services are Wednesday at Patterson Memorial 
United Methodist Church in Nashville.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Builds 'Ground Forces' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STEAMBOAT ROCK, Iowa (AP) -- Steve Forbes took time to scorn  
congressional Republicans and the ``games they play,'' but his real 
passion was focused on the red, white and blue birthday cake and 
the 300 activists celebrating No. 52 with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ground forces, the volunteers who are willing to do the work  
is what we're after,'' said Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumbling across the state in a couple of high-tech buses, Forbes  
was collecting backers the old-fashioned way by meeting them one at 
a time, but few computer-era tricks were missed along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	`You put all that together, message, ground forces, resources,  
that's how you have a chance to win,'' said Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrapped up his first colorful day on a farmhouse lawn  
munching pork chops to celebrate turning 52 next week. It was one 
of five grassroots stops, all part of a week-long tour to 26 of 
Iowa's 99 counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes proclaimed himself delighted with the down-home focus and  
promised more of the same as the campaign for a big straw poll next 
month gets more intense and the state's leadoff precinct caucuses 
near. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is heaven on earth for a campaign,'' said Forbes at one  
stop. ``I wish it could happen every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the swing, Forbes was carefully selecting a message each day,  
and strategists created a high-tech rolling circus to take maximum 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he was slashing the ``high priests of high finance,''  
arguintg that the Federal Reserve is tightening monetary policy and 
damaging farmers. It's a big issue in Iowa, where farm commodity 
prices are at historic low levels. 
</P>
<P>
	He shifts gears today, hammering his anti-tax theme, arguing  
``we're all outsiders in the eyes of Washington.'' Wednesday he 
moves to anti-abortion themes, courting social conservatives leery 
of his position on hot-button social issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Those themes are delivered in day-long strings of grassroots  
meetings, but that was only on the surface. Forbes was rolling 
around the state in banner-festooned buses with music blaring from 
rooftop speakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under that roof, aides were running a high-tech organizational  
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	At each event, Forbes greeted activists and posed for photos  
with them as aides clicked away with special digital cameras. 
Staffers retreated to the back of the bus, where a string of laptop 
computers and printers whirred away as Forbes spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	When the activists left, the photos with Forbes were on a table  
waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Forbes distributed pledge cards for those  
interested. Motoring between stops, aides began working the five 
telephone lines in the bus ``Victory Express II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First, they used the bus' Internet connection to enter the new  
names from the pledge cards in the campaign's database, then began 
phone banking to shore up backing. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening each campaign day, Forbes records a radio blurb on the  
theme of the day. Aide K.B. Forbes works the phone in the back of 
the bus peddling the blurb to local radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Other aides take news-like photos of Forbes with local  
dignitaries, passing them along to local newspapers who might not 
have photographer.

<HEADLINE> Nasal Spray Effective for Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An ouchless flu vaccine that is sprayed up the  
nose has proved effective in protecting people against the virus, 
and researchers say it could reach the market within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are significant hurdles, but our goal is to have it  
available for the flu season of 2000-2001,'' said Dr. J. Leighton 
Read, chairman of Aviron Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., which 
developed the vaccine and helped pay for the research. 
</P>
<P>
	The nasal vaccine, called FluMist, would offer an alternative to  
the standard flu shot millions of Americans get in the arm each 
year. The vaccine needs Food and Drug Administration approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The research, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American  
Medical Association, looked at the vaccine's effectiveness in 
healthy, working adults, who are not normally urged to get flu 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, 4,561 adults were given either the nasal vaccine  
or a placebo. Those who got the vaccine lost 18 percent to 28 
percent fewer days of work to illness with fever, got 23 percent to 
27 percent fewer fevers and made 25 percent to 41 percent fewer 
health-care visits than those who got the placebo. Other research 
has shown the vaccine is effective in children. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more intriguing, the strains of flu virus used in making  
the vaccine that was tested in 1997 and 1998 did not match the 
strain of flu that was prevalent that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the  
World Health Organization and the FDA guess which three strains of 
flu are most likely to be problems during the upcoming flu season. 
The vaccine shot, which consists of dead flu viruses, is then made 
up of those strains. 
</P>
<P>
	FluMist uses live strains of the virus. That triggers a response  
in the body's immune system that might help protect against other 
strains, said Dr. Kristin Nichol of the Minneapolis Veterans 
Administration Hospital, who led the FluMist study. 
</P>
<P>
	She said did not know how FluMist would compare with a shot in a  
head-to-head comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	Read said a dose of FluMist would cost somewhat more than a  
standard flu shot, which averages between $10 and $15. 
</P>
<P>
	It will probably be available only with a visit to a health-care  
provider at first, but Nichol said FluMist eventually might be 
available with a prescription that would enable people to give 
themselves the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	The flu kills about 20,000 people in the United States during an  
average flu season, according to the CDC.

<HEADLINE> Fake Death Suspect Kills Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A Marine accused of molesting children and  
faking his death in a trailer fire five years ago apparently hanged 
himself in his jail cell while awaiting a court-martial on the sex 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Gus Bennett, 45, was found dead Monday night at the  
county jail. Police Lt. Wayne Petersen said Bennett was alone in 
his cell and his body was discovered by another inmate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett had been set to go on trial Wednesday on charges of  
sexually assaulting his young daughters and teen-agers of fellow 
Marines in Yuma, Ariz., and Okinawa, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marine sergeant also faced murder and other charges in Las  
Vegas for allegedly faking his death in 1994 to escape the sex 
charges involving the teen-agers. Prosecutors said he killed a man, 
put the body in his trailer and set it on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Identification of the charred body was nearly impossible. A Navy  
dentist declared the death a suicide and Bennett the victim. That 
allowed his family to collect on a $200,000 government life 
insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bennett was alive. He moved to Hurricane, Utah, with his  
former wife and three daughters and changed his name to Joe Benson. 
His lie unraveled in 1997, when one of his daughters told 
authorities he sexually assaulted her. A fingerprint check revealed 
his identity.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Group Raps Liability Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Insurance data is being used against the  
industry by a consumer group battling efforts to limit jury awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Citizens for Corporate Accountability and Individual Rights said  
Tuesday that legislation has failed to reduce the price of 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``States with little or no tort law restrictions have  
experienced the same level of insurance rates as those states that 
enacted severe restrictions on victims' rights,'' the consumer 
group said in a report that relies on industry data. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has opposed efforts in Congress and state legislatures  
to limit lawsuits that sometimes yield jury awards in the millions 
of dollars for accidents tied to defective products. 
</P>
<P>
	But a spokesman for a property and casualty insurers group  
disputed the report's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do they want?'' asked Steven Goldstein of the Insurance  
Information Institute in New York. ``Do they want to eliminate tort 
reform? The removal of tort reform would clearly raise costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report's release follows the largest product-liability award  
ever handed down. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a Los Angeles jury awarded a record $4.9 billion to  
six motorists who were severely burned when their Chevrolet 
exploded in a rear-end collision. General Motors Corp. plans to 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Robert Hunter and Joanne Doroshow, authors of the report,  
said insurance costs that drive prices are not affected by 
legislation enacted by state lawmakers. The study examined data 
since the mid-1980s when liability insurance premiums skyrocketed 
and insurance was difficult to purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer group says 41 states have enacted legislation  
limiting liability to varying degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry seeks legislation that would reduce jury awards for  
claims of pain and suffering and to speed up litigation, Goldstein 
said. The industry's demands for smaller awards do not apply to 
medical costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is, if you can reduce the costs of litigiousness you  
can reduce costs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doroshow said industry officials are wrong, however, when they  
insist that all that's needed is to ``rein in these out-of-control 
juries and you'll see insurance premiums drop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not true. It's a big lie. It's a hoax,'' she said. ``It's  
being played out in state legislatures across the country. 
Lawmakers have been duped. The public has been duped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance rates already are ``near historic lows,'' according to  
Dan Zielinski, spokesman for the American Insurance Association in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Albanese, an analyst with industry rating company A.M.  
Best, attributed this to competition in home and auto insurance and 
a soft market for other insurance policies.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Suspect Won't Be Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- A judge refused Tuesday to allow a  
15-year-old boy accused in a shooting spree at his high school to 
be removed from jail and treated for depression at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Richard Read said T.J. Solomon is receiving  
adequate care in a juvenile detention lockup despite contentions 
from his lawyer that the boy is suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got an opportunity for treatment in a very secure  
environment,'' Read said after Juvenile Court Judge William 
Schneider issued the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon is charged with shooting and wounding six classmates at  
Heritage High School in suburban Conyers on May 20, a month after 
the Littleton, Colo., school shooting left 15 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Ed Garland said he plans to present a more  
detailed petition asking that Solomon be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judge said he would entertain more information,'' said  
Garland, who said defense psychologists have diagnosed Solomon as 
having acute depression.

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Rookie Sees Error of Ways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tony Stewart wants to make sure a snub doesn't tarnish his  
fantastic start in NASCAR. 
</P>
<P>
	So, he was apologetic Tuesday for leaving the track without  
talking to reporters about his disappointing finish in the Jiffy 
Lube 300. He ran out of gas on the 298th lap, settling for 10th 
place in a race he had dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I hadn't run out of there,'' Stewart said. ``I was so  
consumed with emotion after the race was over that I just didn't do 
the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the final laps Sunday at New Hampshire International  
Speedway, Stewart tried to stretch his fuel to the end of the race 
while trying to stay in front of the other contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really haven't had much experience with that,'' Stewart  
said. ``I was trying to keep a lapped car between us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That he did, but while running hard he probably upset the plan.  
As a result, the driver who is perhaps the best Winston Cup rookie 
in the last two decades will have to wait for his first victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being the competitor that I am, I'm not exactly the most  
approachable person after something like that,'' he said. ``I 
really regret what I did, but if I wasn't such a competitor it 
would have been easy to deal with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart admits he's been testy with the media at times,  
particularly photographers. Last month at Pocono International 
Raceway, he complained that an Associated Press photographer was 
taking too much time to set up a shot. The photographer said it 
took less than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said he didn't realize the seriousness of his snub on  
Sunday until he was on the plane back to Charlotte, N.C. But by 
that time, it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Indy Racing League champion said his first goal once  
he calmed down was to right the wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've taken some grief over this, and I deserve it,'' he said,  
referring to media reaction. ``I know I have to deal with the good 
days and the bad, and I just hope people will see the big picture, 
that sometimes you do or say things in the heat of battle that you 
wish you could take back. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys who are just trying to do your jobs. I didn't mean to  
hurt anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has discussed the situation with car owner Joe Gibbs,  
but he did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart knows he'll probably be asked about the snub at the next  
stop on the schedule, the Pennsylvania 500 on July 25. He will be 
ready to deal with it and the question of when he'll break through 
for the first of what most figure will be many victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't bother me,'' said Stewart, who most of the time  
as a rookie has been laid back and an easy interview. ``If you're 
in contention all the time, it'll come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the talent Stewart first displayed as a terror of the  
USAC short-track circuit, and his 1997 IRL title, he is surprised 
to be sixth in points halfway through his first Winston Cup season. 
Jody Ridley, who finished seventh in 1980, is the only rookie to 
finish in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the competitiveness of the circuit, few figured  
Stewart would be much more than a middle-of-the-pack racer in his 
first season -- the driver included. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have considered 20th to be a successful season,''  
Stewart said. ``I still would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the crashes and breakdowns expected of rookies haven't  
happened. He runs among the top five virtually every week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony Stewart is great,'' said Hall of Famer driver Buddy  
Baker, now a commentator for CBS, TBS and ESPN. ``He's also the 
bravest racer I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Stewart is aware of what's being said about his  
ability, but doesn't want to lose perspective. Despite his success, 
he still sees himself as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a certain lack of knowledge,'' he said. ``I still have  
some things to learn.''

<HEADLINE> Schnellenberger To Coach New Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- At an age associated with retirement,  
Howard Schnellenberger is starting over. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnellenberger, 65, became Florida Atlantic's first football  
coach Monday. He signed a seven-year contract for $150,000 annually 
and will lead the Fighting Owls when they play their first game 
Sept. 8, 2001, against Cornell. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old war horse has risen again, and he's ready for  
battle,'' Schnellenberger said. ``This is the most important thing 
I've ever undertaken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since May 1998, Schnellenberger has been raising money and  
laying a foundation for the new program as director of football 
operations. He decided he was the best person for the coaching job, 
and school president Anthony Catanese said no one else was 
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recommended to Dr. Catanese that he consider me for this  
position,'' said the gruff, gravel-voiced Schnellenberger. ``I'm 
delighted that he concurred with my recommendation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schnellenberger made the Miami Hurricanes a national power in  
the early 1980s, then built Louisville into a Top 25 program. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the right man to lead our team onto the field and into  
the 21st century,'' Catanese said. 
</P>
<P>
	The school also announced that 1966 graduate Tom Oxley,  
president of the Royal Palm Polo Club, has pledged $4 million for a 
new athletic complex and practice field. The donation pushed 
Florida Atlantic's football fund-raising campaign to $8 million, 
all of it brought in by Schnellenberger. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Atlantic, a state university with 22,000 students and  
seven campuses, also wants to raise money for an $80 million domed 
stadium to open in 2003. That's when the school plans to join 
Division I. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the densely populated surrounding area is rich in  
wealthy boosters and high school talent, Schnellenberger envisions 
Florida Atlantic developing quickly into a perennial power on the 
scale of Florida State and Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on a collision course with a national championship, and  
time is the only variable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnellenberger made a similar statement at the start of his  
stint in Miami and Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	The coaching job is Schnellenberger's first since he spent one  
turbulent season at Oklahoma in 1995. Besieged by ugly rumors 
regarding his drinking and treatment of players, he resigned under 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	But in South Florida, Schnellenberger's reputation remains  
untarnished. He was the Miami Dolphins' offensive coordinator when 
they went 17-0 in 1972, and he led the Hurricanes to the first of 
their four national championships in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The new coach was introduced at a news conference that seemed  
more like a pep rally, thanks to high school cheerleaders and 
recorded marching-band music. Two students modeled Fighting Owls 
uniforms that included a wide stripe down the sides of each jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to make our short little guys look a lot taller,''  
Schnellenberger joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 200 boosters and members of the faculty and staff were on  
hand, and Schnellenberger shook their hands with the zeal of a 
campaigning politician. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, when discussing his plan to build another football  
factory, he acknowledged skepticism among the school's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the only guy who believes in what I'm doing, deep down in  
his heart,'' Schnellenberger said. ``They want to believe, but they 
have to be shown.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Down 37.04 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks dropped today as concerns about Latin  
America's economic recovery muted investor optimism about strong 
second-quarter profit reports. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 37.04 at 11,163.94 after having achieved three closing highs 
in the past four sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also dropped. The Nasdaq composite  
index fell 24.48 to 2,765.45 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index 
slipped 7.31 to 1,391.79. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan fell 1 3/16 to 138 3/4 and Citigroup slipped 1 5/16 to  
47 7/16 as the financial services sector stumbled on worries about 
its exposure to weak capital markets in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	But Merrill Lynch rose 1 3/16 to 79 1/16 on  
stronger-than-expected second-quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Latin American markets fell sharply Monday on what  
analysts described as lingering worries about the state of the 
region's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news of the earnings season is being overshadowed by  
concerns about Latin America,'' said Marshall Acuff, equity 
strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices, which rose markedly on Monday as investors sought a  
safe haven from a new Latin America crisis, held steady today. That 
helped limit the extent of any selloff of stocks to the financial 
services sector, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks also were under pressure from concerns that the brisk  
U.S. economy will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest 
rates again this fall, a move that could undermine corporate 
profits later this year and into 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has been overbought quite a bit in the few weeks  
and we expected it to have some kind of reaction,'' said Eugene 
Mintz, financial markets analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were mostly down as investors prepared for  
Intel to release its second-quarter earnings after the market 
closed. Intel, the world's biggest computer chip maker, was down 1/8 
at 64 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Biotechnology giant Amgen soared 6 3/8 at 72 11/16 7/8 after the  
company's profit report late Monday beat Wall Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com rose 5 7/16 to 123 after announcing it is expanding  
it Web site to include toys and electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 590.91 million 
shares, up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 2.94 at 652.85, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 4.75 at 810.79.

<HEADLINE> Moos a Journalist Dispensing Comedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Where are the comediennes on TV today? What  
women make you laugh with their go-for-broke commitment, as Lucille 
Ball or Carol Burnett once did? 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly 20 years, CNN, of all places, has been the home of  
one of television's funniest females. On this almost-all-news 
channel, she's the journalist dispensing comic relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm the humorist of the network,'' says Jeanne Moos,  
``but that's certainly not an official title.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No, her official title is national news correspondent. Life's  
tiny, indomitable details are her beat. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Jeanne Moos (sounds like genie, rhymes with close) could  
have done justice to the three-legged pantyhose called 
Apair-N-Aspare, in a piece that included boisterous public feedback 
and her own unabashed product test. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1,750-pound walrus blubbering about muscle spasms? Moos  
reported on walrus massage therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Catching hot dogs fired from a shoulder-mounted wiener  
launcher?There was Moos with glove raised at the Phillies' Veterans 
Stadium. It was, she said, ``a moment to relish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She gave viewers an Easter-time tour of the plant that makes  
Marshmallow Peeps, where the wax eyes for this baby-chick-shaped 
confection were applied ``under the ever-watchful eye of -- we kid 
you not -- Candy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And after posing a question no one had ever asked before -- how  
is every timepiece advertisement the same? -- Moos enlightened her 
flock: Every clock and watch is set at 10 minutes after 10, so that 
the hands, with their V-shape, describe a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Refreshingly goofy yet shrewdly observed, a Moos essay wrings  
every bit of humor and existential truth from its topic, and at a 
breakneck pace. The visuals are densely packed, while Moos' 
stream-of-consciousness narrative (a piece on traffic cones invokes 
the Coneheads and even Yankee pitcher David Cone) is delivered in a 
voice not unlike a brass band warming up. 
</P>
<P>
	Moos never mocks her subject or glazes it with irony. Instead,  
she is in it up to her ankles -- sometimes literally, as when she 
reported on the high-pressure career of racehorses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wonder if you've considered meditation,'' Moos asked a steed  
with stomach ulcers when she stopped by its stall. ``St. John's 
Wort? Aromatherapy?'' Then she took a whiff and quipped, ``This one 
NEEDS aromatherapy!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her thrice-weekly reports, each of which gets multiple airings  
in between the timely, serious stuff, are designed to inform and, 
no matter how familiar you might be with the Moos oeuvre, to catch 
you off-guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Off-guard, even for the CNN anchors: Back on camera after a Moos  
feature, what can they say? 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it funny to watch the anchors coming out of one of my  
pieces,'' Moos confides. ``This morning we did one on ear-waxing 
for men. You know, guys with hairy ears -- a cosmetic thing. It's 
fun to watch the anchors and how they handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She has offered a visitor one of the bright orange chairs in her  
blue-walled office at CNN's New York bureau. The color scheme 
brings to mind a 1950s Howard Johnson's restaurant. Or could this 
be an office at Comedy Central? 
</P>
<P>
	All in all, it's a bit hard to imagine Moos reporting on the  
Beijing student uprising or interviewing former Soviet leader 
Mikhail Gorbachev -- especially after seeing her destroy a Furby 
doll. But she did. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduation from Syracuse University and a brief stint as  
correspondent for an upstate New York station, Moos joined CNN in 
its infancy. Then she spent a dozen years juggling regular 
reporting chores and what she calls ``sort of weird stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was dicey,'' she admits. ``I would do really serious  
stories one day, and the next day do a screwball thing. Some of the 
people at the network had a problem with it. But I always argued, 
`Life is tragic one minute and funny the next!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Then covering the United Nations during the Gulf War ``put me  
over the edge,'' she says. ``I really don't like hard news. I love 
to watch it, but I can't kind of stand to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Better she should contemplate the little things the news  
upstages, things like hard-to-open milk cartons or those 
network-identification ``bugs'' infesting your TV screen. (For that 
story, Moos deployed a fly swatter.) 
</P>
<P>
	Then, sometimes, the subject gets a little racier.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got in a cage with a naked man in a SoHo gallery who was  
acting like a dog,'' she notes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dog Man was famous in Russia as a performance artist, and  
anyone could get in the cage and he would sort of attack you. I 
think the producers felt I shouldn't have gotten in a cage with a 
naked dog man. But I like to be a little subversive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a funny report and Moos emerged unmauled. So what's the  
big woof? 
</P>
<P>
	``Not just CNN but everybody did O.J. Simpson for more than a  
year,'' Moos reasons. ``I don't think it's so far out, what I do.''

<HEADLINE> Ventura Defends His Renewed WWF Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura defended his return to  
professional wrestling Tuesday, insisting he's entitled to a life 
outside politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura bristled when asked whether his renewed ties to the  
World Wrestling Federation threatened the dignity of the governor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were a nightclub singer in Caesars Palace, would you ask  
the same question?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the only time he compared himself to a Las Vegas  
lounge act. Within the hour, he was on Minnesota Public Radio, 
using an identical argument against his critics. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor, who wrestled professionally as Jesse ``The Body''  
Ventura until retiring in 1986, scheduled a news conference 
Wednesday with the World Wrestling Federation. He plans to 
participate Aug. 22 in the WWF's $29.95 pay-per-view ``SummerSlam'' 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's role has been billed as a return to the ring. Whether  
he will wrestle or referee is a secret for now. The sold-out event 
is scheduled for the Target Center in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura wouldn't divulge his role in the event or answer  
questions about how much he would be paid or where the money will 
go, though he said Monday some will go to charity. He did respond 
to criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no rule that says a governor can't have fun,'' Ventura  
said. ``There's no rule that says a governor on his own time can't 
be a human.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His appearance on the WWF event is simply a return to his  
profession before he was governor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The perception is that people need to be professional  
politicians and that therefore being a politician is your entire 
life. Well, it's not Jesse Ventura's entire life and I think I was 
elected upon the fact that I came from being a private citizen,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, state GOP Chairman Ron Eibensteiner called Ventura's  
actions ``an absolute outrage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so obvious, so transparent, that he is using the office  
of governor to promote his own personal enrichment,'' Eibensteiner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura shot back Tuesday on MPR, noting that GOP St. Paul Mayor  
Norm Coleman just struck a deal as a paid Saturday afternoon radio 
host. The governor receives no money for his weekly radio show. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where's the outcry? See, for Republicans, he's an  
entrepreneur,'' Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura believes his appearance on the WWF show would be a boost  
for the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``More people will see Minnesota again and it will put us in the  
spotlight again,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't take away from his gubernatorial duties because he  
generally doesn't work on Sundays, the day of the event, and the 
job requires no travel because the event is at the Target Center.

<HEADLINE> Women Urge Senators About Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thirty groups that deal with women's and  
children's affairs are urging senators to oppose legislation that 
would make it more difficult to erase debts through bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups signed letters sent to all 100 members of the Senate,  
which is expected soon to consider a bill, being pushed by banks 
and credit card companies, that would rewrite the bankruptcy laws. 
The letter complains that the bill would hurt single women and 
their children owed support payments by bankrupt fathers. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would put ``economically vulnerable women and  
children at greater risk,'' said the letter sent late last month. 
By expanding legal claims against debtors of credit card companies, 
finance companies and auto lenders, they said, ``the bill would set 
up a competition for scarce resources'' between commercial 
creditors and parents and children owed child support. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton complained last year that the legislation  
would put credit card companies ahead of single mothers and 
children owed support when it comes to collecting debt under 
bankruptcy. She has been pushing in recent months to amend it. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has divided the Democrats, allowing a bankruptcy  
overhaul bill to pass the House in May by a veto-proof 313-108 
margin. The Clinton administration has opposed the House measure, 
sponsored by Reps. George Gekas, R-Pa., and Jim Moran, D-Va., which 
is stricter toward debtors than the Senate version. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chief author of the Senate bill,  
has been trying to work out compromises with opponents. Sen. Robert 
Torricelli, D-N.J., is co-sponsor of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley and the House measure's sponsors say the legislation  
helps women whose husbands or former husbands have filed for 
bankruptcy by giving child support and alimony payments a higher 
priority than credit card debt and other obligations. Under current 
law, some debts -- such as bankruptcy lawyers' fees -- must be paid 
before child support or alimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything possible has been done (in the Senate bill) to  
protect child support payments,'' Grassley spokeswoman Jill Kozeny 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that includes a new provision allowing debtors who owe  
child support to erase more debts in bankruptcy proceedings than 
those who don't. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Ms. Kozeny said, when a parent who owes child  
support files for bankruptcy, ``there will be a smaller number -- 
not a larger number -- of debts that will compete with child support 
and alimony after a bankruptcy has been completed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents maintain that the legislation, by barring certain  
credit card debts from being erased in bankruptcy, would force 
single mothers and children owed support by bankrupt fathers to 
compete with credit card companies in collecting debts. 
</P>
<P>
	By sending the letters to senators, the women's groups showed  
``an understanding of how much bankruptcy is a woman's issue,'' 
said Joan Entmacher, vice president of the liberal National Women's 
Law Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30 groups signing the letter included the liberal National  
Organization for Women, the faith-based Church Women United, the 
Association for Children for Enforcement of Support, the American 
Medical Women's Association, Business and Professional Women USA, 
the National Black Women's Health Project, the National Council of 
Jewish Women, the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press and 
the YWCA.

<HEADLINE> Damages vs. Auto Industry Alarming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The second huge verdict by a California jury against an  
automaker in four days seems to reflect a change in juror 
attitudes, some legal analysts said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Superior Court jury in Ceres, Calif. on Monday awarded $5  
million in compensation and $290 million in punitive damages to the 
family of a couple and their son who were killed when a 1978 Ford 
Bronco swerved to avoid a collision and overturned on a freeway in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, a Los Angeles jury said General Motors Co. must pay  
$4.9 billion to six people who were severely burned when their 1979 
Chevrolet Malibu's fuel tank exploded in a rear-end crash. 
</P>
<P>
	In both cases, lawyers for the plaintiffs offered evidence that  
the auto companies were aware of potential structural weaknesses in 
the vehicles and did not correct them, charges that both Ford Motor 
Co. and GM have denied. Both companies plan to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the size of the awards may be indicative of a  
trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have started to see much larger verdicts in product  
liability cases than ever before,'' said Los Angeles attorney Ed 
Woodsome, who has defended companies in product-defect suits for 25 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is increased publicity about these cases, increased  
awareness by the general public. ... Jurors tend to believe people 
like themselves rather than faceless corporations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chief executive of a Los Angeles-based trial consulting  
firm, Decision Quest, said a shift in juror thinking has been 
visible since the 1995 O.J. Simpson murder trial, in which the firm 
was a consultant for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	``It allowed a lot of people to recognize that if they serve as  
jurors, they have the power to change the course of an issue,'' 
said Philip K. Anthony. ``More and more juries view themselves as 
having authority to legislate social change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the families in the Ford case described the trend  
more favorably. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the American public is waking up to the carnage  
that's being visited upon the public by some American industries 
such as tobacco and automobiles,'' said attorney Laurence Drivon. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's $4.9 billion verdict against General Motors in Los  
Angeles prompted widespread predictions by experts that the 
punitive damages would be cut dramatically or overturned, by either 
the trial judge or an appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the punitive damages against Ford were closer to the  
compensation awarded in the case, Woodsome and Anthony said they 
expect Superior Court Judge Roger Beauchesne to reduce the damages. 
Drivon disagreed, saying the punitives were less than 10 days' net 
profits for Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford asked for a mistrial early Monday, saying news of the GM  
verdict must be influencing the jury, but the judge refused. 
</P>
<P>
	The case stemmed from an accident on Interstate 5 near Turlock,  
Calif., in June 1993. Juan Romo, 19, driving the Bronco, swerved to 
avoid a van he was passing and rolled over. His mother, Salustia, 
40; his father, Ramon, 39; and his brother, Ramiro, 18, were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Romo and his two sisters, Evangelina, 14, and Maria, 8, suffered  
minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Their lawyers sought to show that Ford knew the Bronco's roof  
was unsafe but decided to save the small extra cost of reinforcing 
the roof with steel, a change made on post-1979 Broncos. 
Plaintiffs' witnesses included a former Ford executive vice 
president, Tom Feeney, who said company officials knew the roof was 
virtually certain to fail in a rollover. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford spokesman Jim Cain said Feeney ``never worked in truck  
product development'' and was not credible. Ford said the Bronco 
was sound and met federal safety standards, and blamed the deaths 
on Romo and the driver he was passing.

<HEADLINE> Gore Displays Family-Man Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES (AP) -- Showing off family snapshots in a pocket-sized  
album, Vice President Al Gore courted Iowa's farm vote, labor vote 
-- and Grandpa vote -- on Tuesday. He said he now considers public 
policy with his 9-day-old grandson in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I talk about education policy and school safety, I'm  
thinking about it now in quite a different way than I did just 10 
days ago,'' the presidential hopeful said. 
</P>
<P>
	He picked up the prize endorsement of Iowa's first lady and the  
overnight hospitality of the officially neutral Gov. Tom Vilsack. 
</P>
<P>
	While the vice president made this trip bearing gifts for  
steelworkers -- he boasted of his work with Russian Prime Minister 
Sergei Stepashin to broker a ``breakthrough'' deal on cheap Russian 
steel imports -- and promises for Iowa farmers, it was the 
grandparents he courted most enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
	With a routine now predictable to his traveling entourage, Gore  
touted the arrival of his first grandchild, born to the eldest of 
his four children, Karenna, on July 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any grandparents here? I'm collecting advice,'' he called out  
in the Kirn Junior High gymnasium. He called the experience ``one 
of those milestones in life that actually has a profound impact on 
the way you think about the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, he said, the best counsel so far was ``just give that  
grandchild whatever he wants, then if it causes any problems, give 
him back to his parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether by coincidence or design, his emphasis on his family  
life at stop after stop -- he called his photographer over to snap 
him before a ``Go Grandpa Gore'' poster at the Omaha airport -- 
seemed to underscore a distinction between himself and the personal 
scandals of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore offered some of those he met here a flip through his new  
mini-album of photos taken by his wife, Tipper. All but one -- of 
Karenna and baby Wyatt -- showed Grandpa gingerly cradling the tiny 
infant. 
</P>
<P>
	To Robert Honig, 81, Gore presented a welcome image, especially  
when juxtaposed to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good, honest man who's handled himself real nice,''  
said the Council Bluffs grandfather of two. ``It hasn't been easy, 
either, with a partner like that always getting into trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Tuesday, Gore was working to plump up his statewide  
organization in back-to-back dinners -- first with 17 black 
activists who he hopes will help get Iowans to next winter's 
caucuses, then with some five dozen local women. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gov. Vilsack has said he'll stay neutral in order to  
preserve a ``level playing field'' in the state's caucuses -- the 
traditional start of the nation's presidential nominating contests 
-- his wife, Christie, campaigned at Gore's side on this two-day 
swing through Council Bluffs and Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
	On the same day that Mrs. Vilsack announced her support for  
Gore, which state campaign director Steve Hildebrand called a 
``huge boost'' to the organizational drive, the vice president 
pointed out to audiences along the way that he would, for the first 
time, be the house guest of the governor at his Victorian mansion, 
Terrace Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's only rival for the  
Democratic nomination, had also personally courted Mrs. Vilsack's 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	Wooing Iowa's farmers, Gore railed against what he called  
``Republican-passed'' farm legislation signed three years ago by 
Clinton. The Freedom to Farm Act, which ended the link between farm 
prices and government subsidies to farmers, ``is not working as it 
was advertised,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he asked House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate  
Republican leader Trent Lott, during their Oval Office meeting 
Monday with Clinton, to work with him on provisions to increase 
subsidies to family farmers in crises of weather and economics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say they jumped at the chance,'' Gore told a  
backyard gathering in Council Bluffs. ``I'd rather do it on a 
bipartisan basis, but if that's not possible then we'll back up and 
head straight at them.''

<HEADLINE>  Iran Protesters Defy Government Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- In a flashback to the  
revolution that installed Iran's Islamic government 20 years ago, 
baton-wielding police fired tear gas to disperse 10,000 protesters 
on the streets of Tehran today, the sixth day of protests against 
hard-liners who have thwarted reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrators quickly regrouped in nearby streets where they  
burned buses and hurled abuse at hard-line clerics. 
</P>
<P>
	The unrest that started Thursday has left two people dead and  
scores injured. It is the first time students and ordinary Iranians 
have taken to streets in such big numbers to confront the powerful 
hard-liners opposing the political and social reforms of moderate 
President Mohammad Khatami, a hero of the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests have spread to at least 10 other towns during the  
past days, highlighting the widespread frustration with the 
clerics. Iran has not witnessed such serious public protests -- up 
to 25,000 took part in one rally in Tehran -- since the 1979 Islamic 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's violence began after police in helicopters, speaking  
through loudspeakers, asked demonstrators to vacate the area, 
warning them of arrest, witnesses contacted by telephone from Dubai 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the students did not leave, police in riot gear fired tear  
gas, moved into the crowd and pulled away men and women by the hair 
while beating others with batons. Scores were hauled away in police 
trucks, the witnesses said, requesting anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The area was cleared within minutes, but a few hundred people  
fled south of the sprawling campus and set several empty buses in 
the commercial district ablaze, the witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another group of about 1,000 gathered on a nearby street north  
of the university. Some lit small fires in the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Students shouted ``unity, unity,'' and slogans against Ansar, a  
vigilante group whose thugs are controlled by the hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
	Shops and banks closed and pedestrians fled, the witnesses said.  
</P>
<P>
	Three Iranian journalists -- two cameramen working for a German  
TV network and a reporter with another foreign news agency -- were 
beaten by demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
	The TV journalists said the protesters smashed their car and  
attacked them, presuming they worked for Iranian television, which 
is controlled by the hard-liners and has been criticized for its 
biased coverage of the protests. 
</P>
<P>
	The reporters, who didn't wish to be identified further, said  
the protesters hurled abuse and chanted slogans against 
hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
	Official Tehran radio called the protesters ``rioters'' who had  
gone on the rampage and smashed shop windows. It said ``security 
forces dealt with them firmly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``One moment everything was fine, and the next moment everything  
went crazy,'' said one witness who was in the middle of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Life in other parts of the sprawling city of 10 million was  
normal, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday police also attacked at least two groups of  
demonstrators with tear gas and batons and fired gunshots in the 
air. Scores were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Monday, the Tehran governor's office said that ``no form of  
gathering'' would be allowed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami and moderate newspapers also have urged people to break  
up the protests, fearing the demonstrations would spin out of 
control and lead to a brutal police crackdown that would further 
set back Khatami's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Khatami's May 1997 election, ordinary citizens had hoped  
the strict social and political restrictions they have lived under 
since the revolution would be loosened. 
</P>
<P>
	But they have been frustrated by the hard-liners' unyielding  
hold on power because of the support of the supreme leader 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and their total control of the armed forces, 
the police, the judiciary, the Intelligence Ministry and the media. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstrations were triggered by the unauthorized police  
raid on a Tehran University hostel early Friday after the students 
rallied Thursday against the banning of a liberal newspaper. The 
attack apparently was carried out with the backing of hard-line 
clerics. 
</P>
<P>
	One person was killed and 20 injured in the assault. On Sunday,  
a theology student was shot dead in the northwestern city of 
Tabriz, where students smashed shop windows and set a vehicle on 
fire. A large but peaceful funeral was held for him today, IRNA 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran fired two security chiefs and reprimanded a third after the  
raid, but the steps have failed to appease the protesters.

<HEADLINE> Tour de France Reaches the Alps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNECY, France (AP) -- For the climbing specialists in the Tour  
de France, winding mountain passes and thin air will come as a 
relief after a week of flat stages. 
</P>
<P>
	After a day's rest, the tour resumes today in the French Alps  
where the tough terrain can make or break champions. 
</P>
<P>
	American Lance Armstrong, enjoying an incredible renaissance and  
wearing the coveted yellow jersey for the second time, leads 
France's Christophe Moreau by more than two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Texan has been training hard for the mountain  
stages. But after his stunning victory in Sunday's time trial, 
which he said left him exhausted, today's climb was a test of his 
recovery powers . 
</P>
<P>
	``Before coming in, we all thought I would climb better than I  
would time trial,'' Armstrong said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Echoing the sentiment of many riders, he believes the real  
racing begins at altitude. ``The phoney war is over. Now the real 
one begins,'' he said after Sunday's victory in Metz. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's 133.4-mile stage begins in the resort of Le Grand  
Bornand and ends across the Italian border in the ski center of 
Sestrieres. 
</P>
<P>
	The race begins downhill, but from then on it's a daunting,  
relentless climb, with riders having to scale the Col du Telegraphe 
en route to the 8,729-foot Col du Galibier. 
</P>
<P>
	After a descent to Briancon, the riders faced two further climbs  
before Sestrieres. 
</P>
<P>
	``I and others will have to attack,'' said Spaniard Abraham  
Olano, currently in third place, who was eclipsed by Armstrong on 
Sunday. ``It's looking good for Armstrong. But there are still two 
weeks left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Alps presented a chance for controversial Frenchman Richard  
Virenque, who tour officials tried to ban from the circuit for drug 
use, only to be overruled by world cycling authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Virenque was a member of the Festina team banned from last  
year's drug-plagued tour. Unlike most of his former teammates, he 
denies ever knowingly taking illegal substances. But Tour de France 
officials say he has come to epitomize drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing Armstrong by 7 minutes, 21 seconds, the four-time King  
of the Mountains would dearly love to grab the headlines for the 
right reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to hope that the leaders crack there,'' Virenque said.  
``I hope to do well in the mountains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My fitness is getting better and better. Every day that  
passes, I'm in better shape. In sporting terms, I'm now in my 
domain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Racing in the Alps, where temperatures are forecast to be high  
today and Wednesday, is a test of physical and mental endurance. 
Many racers openly dread it. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how he felt about mountain stages, Frenchman Christophe  
Capelle, of the BigMat team, didn't mince words: ``I hate them,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And it gets even tougher Wednesday when racers have to scale the  
longest climb on the tour en route to the Alpe d'Huez. After that, 
it's a descent Thursday to the city of Saint-Etienne.

<HEADLINE> SUV Sales Growth Still High but... </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Demand for some sport utility vehicles is  
leveling off as the segment becomes more crowded, but SUV sales 
continue to increase faster than any other segment of the 
automotive market. 
</P>
<P>
	The slackening demand is mostly among models that have not been  
redesigned in several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's more competition, more entries, more good stuff from  
the Japanese and European producers,'' analyst David Healy of 
Burnham Securities Inc. said Tuesday. ``It's more of that than the 
whole segment slowing down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industrywide, SUV sales were up 11 percent in the first half of  
the year, while the entire car and light truck market was up 7 
percent. While the torrid sales pace of the last few years is 
unlikely to be sustained, analysts don't forecast a drop in SUV 
sales anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler AG surprised the industry late last week when it  
announced production of the redesigned Jeep Grand Cherokee would be 
scaled back starting next Monday, even though sales were up 12 
percent in the first six months of the year and 9 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Dan Moore said the automaker had been overly  
optimistic about demand for the '99 version. When the '99 went into 
production a year ago, the Detroit plant had been upgraded to make 
it more efficient and was able to produce at a higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jeep plant is returning to the same production rate it had  
before the '99 model went into production to allow large 
inventories on dealer lots to be scaled back. Jeep also is offering 
a discounted lease deal to reduce dealer inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very market-driven,'' Moore said. ``We've cut back all  
the overtime, but that may only last another month or so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newer models continue to sell robustly. Sales of  
DaimlerChrysler's Dodge Durango, for example, were up 37 percent in 
the first half and 27 percent in June. Ford's big Expedition was up 
13 percent in the first half, while the midsize Lexus RX300 was up 
a whopping 149 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Motor Co., which just began selling the compact Xterra  
SUV to compete in the lower end of the market, also reports brisk 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't keep 'em in the showrooms,'' spokesman Fred Standish  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Models that have not been redesigned in several years are not  
experiencing the same demand. 
</P>
<P>
	At General Motors Corp., sales of the big, profitable GMC  
Suburban were off 13 percent in the first half of the year, while 
sales of the slightly smaller Chevrolet Tahoe were down 26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suburban and its Chevrolet twin as well as the Tahoe and its  
GMC twin, the Yukon, are being redesigned for the 2000 model year. 
GM plans to begin producing the first of the new models in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of GM's Blazer midsize SUV were off 4 percent in the first  
six months of the year, while sales of its GMC twin, the Jimmy, 
were down 6 percent. Those models are not scheduled for a redesign 
before 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for Ford Motor Co.'s Explorer were up 4 percent in the  
first half but down 5 percent in June, in large part because of the 
comparison to record truck sales in June 1998.

<HEADLINE>  China, Taiwan in War of Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China intensified its attacks on Taiwanese  
President Lee Teng-hui today, accusing him of pursuing independence 
for the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said Lee was taking  
``extremely dangerous steps. She repeated that Beijing was ready to 
use force to block formal independence for the island, which it 
regards as a renegade province. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing was outraged by Lee's comments to German radio station  
Deutsche Welle that China and Taiwan have ``state-to-state'' 
dealings. The characterization runs counter to Beijing's insistence 
that Taiwan is part of China. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan and the mainland have been separated since a civil war 50  
years ago, but both say they intend one day to reunite. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that Lee Teng-hui and the Taiwan authorities will stop  
all activities and remarks aimed at splitting the motherland,'' 
Zhang said at a regular news briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-run Xinhua News Agency accused Lee of deliberately  
spoiling a recent easing of tensions between Taiwan and the 
mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the heated rhetoric, Taiwan's main stock index  
tumbled 3.1 percent today. The Weighted Stock Price Index fell 
259.40 points to 8,204.50. 
</P>
<P>
	About a third of Taiwanese listed companies have investments in  
China, and their business could be hurt by tensions between the two 
sides, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan said Monday that by labeling their dealings  
``state-to-state relations'' it aimed to encourage more 
constructive talks with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the Taiwan authorities will not underestimate the firm  
resolve of the central government to safeguard the sovereignty, 
dignity and territorial integrity of our country, and will not 
underestimate the strength of courage of the Chinese people in the 
fight against separatism and Taiwan independence,'' Zhang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, who won Taiwan's first free presidential election in 1996,  
has said he will consider eventual reunification only after the 
mainland becomes democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese officials and state media have not resorted to such  
direct criticism of Lee since the 1996 elections, when Beijing 
launched war games and missile tests near Taiwan to intimidate 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang did not say whether the latest disagreement would affect  
plans for China's top negotiator with Taiwan, Wang Daohan, to visit 
the island's capital, Taipei, later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, she noted a statement by Wang that Lee's comments had  
``wiped out the foundation for contacts'' and said he was waiting 
for clarification from Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not undertake to give up the use of force, which is by  
no means directed against our compatriots in Taiwan. It is rather 
against the attempts by foreign forces to interfere in China's 
reunification hopes and for Taiwan independence,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Screening Process Suggested to IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Cities interested in staging future Olympic Games  
must meet certain qualifications before being allowed to submit a 
bid, a special panel proposed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A working group of IOC 2000, a reform commission set up in the  
wake of the Salt Lake City scandal, reached consensus on the need 
for a ``bid acceptance'' procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would make sure that before a city could become a candidate  
they would have to meet certain technical standards,'' said Anita 
DeFrantz, an IOC vice president who heads the working group. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will save money for the cities that really are not properly  
prepared to bid and will ensure that cities that are accepted are 
cities that have the qualifications to be selected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz spoke in a telephone interview with The Associated  
Press after a daylong meeting of the 18-member panel in Lausanne, 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee is studying ways of  
reforming the bidding and selection process to avoid the type of 
vote-buying abuses which marked Salt Lake City's choice as host of 
the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Other details, including the timetable for the bid screening  
procedure, still have to be worked out. The panel will meet again 
Sept. 2 and make its final recommendations on Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bid procedure will apply immediately to the race for the  
2008 Summer Games. Ten cities have expressed their intention to 
bid, including Beijing, Paris and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz said it was ``premature'' to discuss who would judge a  
city's readiness to bid or what the specific technical requirements 
would be. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has previously used a ``pre-selection'' procedure to  
reduce a field of candidates to a short list of finalists, but this 
took place far into the bid process. The new proposal would 
eliminate some cities right from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz said the panel was also considering the possibility of  
having an additional ``filtering out'' process to winnow the field 
later in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	A possible cap on the number of bid cities was discussed, as was  
the question of rotating the games among continents. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has already mandated that the bid process for 2008  
cannot start before Feb. 1, 2000. The host city is scheduled to be 
selected at the IOC session in Moscow in Sept. 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz said the panel also addressed the issue of member  
visits to bid cities. Following the Salt Lake scandal, IOC members 
were banned from visiting the candidate cities for the 2006 Winter 
Games. Many members have pushed for the visits to be reinstated 
under tighter controls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know there are some plusses and minuses to the visits,''  
DeFrantz said. ``We're reviewing it. It's not conclusive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz suggested other changes from the 2006 process were  
likely. A small panel chose two 2006 finalists from the six-city 
European field, with the full general assembly selecting the winner 
immediately afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian city of Turin defeated the Swiss town of Sion in  
last month's vote in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked about 2006 and the things that worked well,''  
DeFrantz said. ``But the Summer Games and Winter Games are not the 
same. So while that worked well for 2006, for 2008 we need to keep 
in mind there's likely to be bid cities from more than one 
continent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 80-member IOC 2000 also has working groups studying ways of  
reforming the IOC structure and examining the overall role of the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has scheduled a special session for December to adopt  
the reforms.

<HEADLINE> Flu Vaccine Spray May Be on the Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A nasal spray has proved effective in protecting  
healthy adults against the flu virus and researchers say the 
painless vaccine could reach the market within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are significant hurdles, but our goal is to have it  
available for the flu season of 2000-2001,'' said Dr. J. Leighton 
Read, chairman of Aviron Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., which 
developed the vaccine and helped pay for the research published in 
today's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The spray, called FluMist, would offer an alternative to the  
standard flu shot millions of Americans get in the arm each year. 
The vaccine needs Food and Drug Administration approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The research looked at the vaccine's effectiveness in healthy,  
working adults, who are not normally urged to get flu shots. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, 4,561 adults were given either the nasal vaccine  
or a placebo. Those who got the vaccine lost 18 percent to 28 
percent fewer days of work to illness with fever, got 23 percent to 
27 percent fewer fevers and made 25 percent to 41 percent fewer 
health-care visits than those who got the placebo. Other research 
has shown the vaccine is effective in young people. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more intriguing, the strains of flu virus used in making  
the vaccine that was tested in 1997 and 1998 did not match the 
strain of flu that was prevalent that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the  
World Health Organization and the FDA guess which three strains of 
flu are most likely to be problems during the upcoming flu season. 
The vaccine shot, which consists of dead flu viruses, is then made 
up of those strains. 
</P>
<P>
	FluMist uses live strains of the virus. That triggers a response  
in the body's immune system that might help protect against other 
strains, said Dr. Kristin Nichol of the Minneapolis Veterans 
Administration Hospital, who led the FluMist study. 
</P>
<P>
	She said did not know how FluMist would compare with a shot in a  
head-to-head comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	Read said a dose of FluMist would cost somewhat more than a  
standard flu shot, which averages between $10 and $15. 
</P>
<P>
	It will probably be available only with a visit to a health-care  
provider at first, but Nichol said FluMist eventually might be 
available with a prescription that would enable people to give 
themselves the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	The flu kills about 20,000 people in the United States during an  
average flu season, according to the CDC.

They are the two largest Internet advertising solutions companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will be named DoubleClick and will be based  
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock-for-stock transaction will be accounted for as a  
pooling of interests and will require regulatory and NetGravity 
stockholder approval, which is expected early in this year's fourth 
quarter, the companies said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's move comes a month after DoubleClick announced its  
purchase of Abacus Direct Corp., which manages databases that track 
what people buy, for about $800 million in stock.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Renews Shelling of India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUSHKOH VALLEY, India (AP) -- Pakistan renewed its attack on a  
remote Indian highway tonight as Islamic guerrillas withdrew from 
the mountains of Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	After a daylong silence, the Pakistani anti-aircraft guns and  
artillery struck at National Highway No. 1 snaking through the 
mountains of Kaksar region near the front line town of Kargil. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombardment followed a barrage unleashed by Pakistan on  
Monday night. On Sunday, the two nuclear-armed neighbors had agreed 
to stop shooting and let the Islamic fighters withdraw from the 
mountain posts they had been occupying on India's side of the 1972 
cease-fire line that divides Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani officials in Islamabad said they had no immediate  
comment on the shelling. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian officers speculated the Pakistani fire was a normal  
technique to cover the retreat of its forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were told to expect a lot of artillery fire, under which  
the enemy will get away,'' a commander at one post in Mushkoh 
Valley said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured on the road Monday night, but a boy and a  
young woman in a small village outside Kargil were injured by the 
shells. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mushkoh Valley, and in Kaksar to the east, where shelling  
continued into early today, Indian officers had confirmed seeing 
the first Pakistan-based fighters leaving their stone bunkers. 
Indian troops took control of the abandoned positions, then began 
clearing land mines, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,200 combatants have been reported killed in fighting  
since India discovered in early May that its positions on the 
Himalayan peaks had been taken over. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said today that separatist militants attacked a heavily  
guarded paramilitary police camp 10 miles from the cease-fire line 
and shot dead a senior officer in his quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack took place at a Border Security Force camp in  
Bandipora. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Deputy Inspector General S. K. Chakravorty, the  
militants also killed three other soldiers and the wife of one 
soldier. Two children were injured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	No militant organization has claimed responsibility for the  
killings, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's withdrawal accord came a week after Pakistani Prime  
Minister Nawaz Sharif promised President Clinton to take ``concrete 
steps'' to end the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	India has said it would consider resuming a peace dialogue with  
Pakistan that began in February only after the last intruder has 
left Indian territory. 
</P>
<P>
	India asserts that most of the intruders are Pakistani soldiers.  
Pakistan says the fighters are Kashmiri militants. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the three wars India and Pakistan have fought since gaining  
independence from Britain in 1947, two have been over Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Reno Opposes Eased Export Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Easing export controls on powerful data and  
voice-scrambling technology will hamper efforts to track down 
terrorists and other criminals, the nation's top two law 
enforcement officials told Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh  
registered Clinton administration objections Tuesday to 
encryption-decontrol legislation that is widely supported by 
high-tech companies. 
</P>
<P>
	They said increasing numbers of terrorist groups, drug  
traffickers, child pornographers and financial criminals already 
are using the scrambling technology to avoid detection and 
frustrate prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Any further easing of restrictions will make U.S.-made  
encryption products all the more available and ``will be 
devastating to law enforcement and damage national security,'' 
Freeh told the House Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also reduce any incentive for industry voluntarily to  
develop technology both to protect electronic commerce and to give 
law enforcement a ``key'' to unscramble the information with a 
court's approval, Freeh said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terrorists are now actually using encryption, which means that  
in the future we may wiretap a conversation in which the terrorists 
discuss the location of a bomb soon to go off, but we will be 
unable to prevent the terrorist act because we cannot understand 
the conversation,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hi-tech industry officials said encryption is important to the  
future of worldwide networking and anyway is already widely 
available outside the United States. It is a vital element in 
protecting business dealings, retail transactions over the Internet 
and the privacy of e-mail, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overly restrictive controls ... will either stall the  
networking market or create a major market advantage for foreign 
competitors,'' Elizabeth Kaufman, a Cisco Systems executive, told 
the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that even with the decontrol legislation, industry is  
willing to work with government on a way to give law enforcement 
access to unscrambled data without compromising the customer's 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., the committee chairman, opposed  
lifting current restrictions on encryption exports. He said the 
legislation also could put the nation's military at greater risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be both tragically ironic and unconscionable for  
Congress to make it easier for an adversary to do harm to Americans 
at the same time we are working as a government to improve security 
for Americans all over the world,'' Spence said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, the panel's senior Democrat,  
said it was ``a matter of seeking the right balance'' between 
protecting electronic privacy and recognizing legitimate law 
enforcement and national security needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, by Rep. Robert Goodlatte, R-Va., has been  
referred to four separate House committees. A Senate version by 
Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., is advancing 
through the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Madison Ave.'s Latest Hot Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. women's soccer team got together to  
pitch Disney's theme parks. The maker of Wheaties is talking about 
putting the team on a cereal box. And the players plan an 
exhibition tour this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Star Brandi Chastain created a sensation all by herself for  
Nike's new sports by taking off her jersey in the emotional 
aftermath of the Women's World Cup win in the Rose Bowl last 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	But marketing experts still caution that the burst of attention  
the U.S. women are enjoying this week may be fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we take a look back at this a month from now, I think  
you'll have a hard time remembering most players' names,'' said Bob 
Williams, who heads Burns Sports, a Chicago-based firm that matches 
advertisers and athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Women's World Cup matches drew unexpectedly large crowds to  
arenas across the country over the past three weeks and the TV 
ratings grew as the tournament climaxed with the United States 
beating China in the finale. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Solomon, a top commercial buyer at SFM Media, said Tuesday  
that team members captured Americans' imagination ``not only by 
their playing but by their demeanor'' and expects the feeling will 
have ``some staying power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't argue, they didn't bad-mouth anybody, they were  
always going out of their way to be gracious. The whole idea of the 
teamwork aspect captured the fancy of the public,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Williams said the lack of a professional league for women's  
soccer and tough competition for attention from established sports 
like baseball and football mean it will be hard for the women's 
soccer players to sustain the interest of marketers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Walt Disney Co. shot two ads with the soccer team Saturday  
in the Rose Bowl after its victory. The team shouted ``We're going 
to Disneyland'' in one ad and ``We're going to Disney World'' in 
the other. The television spots were airing around the nation 
Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been using the approach in similar ads for its  
theme parks for the past 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, General Mills Inc. is talking with the team and the  
players about an appearance on a Wheaties cereal box, company 
spokesman Greg Zimprich said Tuesday. ``We are definitely 
interested,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company from Golden Valley, Minn., has heard from hundreds  
of people wondering if the team will be featured on the boxes as 
champions like the U.S. women's hockey team was after winning gold 
in the 1998 Olympics in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been inundated with calls,'' said company spokeswoman  
Natalie Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Reith, a spokeswoman for Nike, said Chastain was one of  
10 U.S. team members wearing the new Nike Inner Actives sports bra 
that goes on sale for $40 on July 25. 
</P>
<P>
	She insisted Nike had not scripted Chastain's decision to rip  
off her jersey and expose the black bra. She noted Chastain has 
described it as a moment of ``temporary insanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, she said Nike ``certainly will capitalize on it.''  
The company will use a photo of Chastain in her sports bra for 
displays in stores and may have Chastain make extra personal 
appearances promote the bra. But Reith was unaware of any broader 
advertising plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will stay in the public's eye for at least several  
months thanks to a planned soccer exhibition tour. 
</P>
<P>
	It will compete against a world all-star team in 11 matches  
starting Oct. 22 in Pittsburgh and ending Dec. 12 in Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Berke, a vice president at the sports marketing firm SFX  
Sports Group which helped organize the tour, said it will allow the 
players to earn money from soccer, stay close to their fans and 
demonstrate the viability of a professional league. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a number of sponsors including beverage, financial  
services and packaged goods companies have expressed interest in 
the tour. He said talks are underway about producing a TV special 
during the tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Bruce, head of sports marketing for the ad agency Foote  
Cone &AMP; Belding, San Francisco, said he thinks the team could also 
be useful in advertising for products that stress dependability and 
performance under pressure. He suggested delivery companies, energy 
drinks, automotive companies and financial services concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the star players like Chastain, Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy  
and Briana Scurry may get more endorsement opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm already has a number of deals with companies like Nike and  
Gatorade and ``stands to get more'' from them as well as additional 
companies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain's performance may endear her to ``brands with more  
edge'' like sunglass makers, energy drinks and those that value 
strength and independence, he said.

<HEADLINE> Community Mourns Slain Student </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Debarah Galyan was outraged when a  
Korean college student in her community was gunned down during a 
white supremacist's killing spree over the Fourth of July weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be with my community to stand against this kind of  
tragedy,'' Galyan, 21, said Monday as she headed into funeral 
services for Won-Joon Yoon. ``You can't have this sense of 
detachment anymore. You have to stand up and say no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galyan joined U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and about 2,000  
of Yoon's family, friends and community members to pay tribute to 
him and decry the circumstances surrounding his death. 
</P>
<P>
	``Haters are cowards,'' Reno told the assemblage. ``When  
confronted, they usually back down. And if they don't back down, 
you must continue to confront them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yoon, 26, who was one of two people slain during the spree.  
Authorities believe the Indiana University undergraduate was killed 
July 4 by Benjamin Smith, a former student who committed suicide 
later that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 21, was a former member of the World Church of the  
Creator, a white supremacist group based in East Peoria, Ill. 
Authorities said he also killed a former basketball coach outside 
Chicago and wounded nine other people -- all of them black, Jewish 
or Asian. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoon, the only son among four children, came to Bloomington  
after earning a master's degree in economics. His goal was to earn 
a doctorate and become a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	At the service, his parents remained largely stoic even as a  
cousin raised the glasses and Bible that Yoon had with him when he 
was shot outside the Korean United Methodist Church. The Rev. 
Kil-Sang Yoon of the United Methodist Church asked them to express 
their pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to invite my brother and sister to cry today, until  
you come to the point, that yes, in this senseless death of our 
son, there is redemptive reason,'' said the clergyman, who is not 
related to the family. 
</P>
<P>
	As the ceremony ended, a beige urn containing Yoon's ashes was  
unveiled in front of his picture. Yoon's father, Shin-Ho Yoon, 
stood and lifted a Bible. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, his expression of grief was unmistakable.

<HEADLINE> A Rose Looks To Bloom in Scotland  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Justin Rose's last shot in the  
British Open flew out of the rough, over a bunker and straight into 
the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	The shot left the 17-year amateur tied for fourth place, and a  
celebrity whose promise seemed endless. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose is now an 18-year-old pro, and the only other thing he's  
remembered for these days is a sorry trail of 22 straight missed 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	He finally made the third round of a tournament two weeks ago at  
the European Grand Prix and placed 74th. Now, after earning barely 
$5,500 in his first year, he has to field questions about turning 
pro so early. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't regret anything I have done, there's no doubt about  
that,'' he said Tuesday, two days before he tees off for the 
British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``Timing didn't quite happen, momentum didn't quite get going.  
But I never regret it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Turning professional -- I'd like to lay this ghost to rest,''  
he said. ``I was turning pro after the British Open no matter what 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose did so poorly after turning pro that he failed to earn his  
playing card for this season and has been relying on sponsors' 
invitations for European tour events. He got his first check after 
dropping to the Challenger series of tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	This a far cry from the time when teen-age girls shouted his  
name as he walked down the fairway at the British Open and the 
country cheered its young hero in the making. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a better player due to everything that has gone on --  
technically, mentally, everything,'' he said. ``I feel a lot 
tougher, there's no doubt. I can take anything that anybody throws 
at me ever again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more times I didn't succeed -- I wouldn't like to call it  
failure -- the more times I didn't do well in a tournament the 
harder I would go home and practice. And the harder you practice 
and not see the results the more frustrating it gets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I'll play fewer events, get my head back together and  
prepare for them a bit more professionally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Rose has struggled, contemporaries like Sergio Garcia and  
David Park have won tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, a 19-year-old Spaniard, won his first European Tour  
title, the Irish Open, in only his sixth event as a pro. Park, a 
Welshman who has moved up from the Challenger series, lost a 
playoff in his first tour event and won the second, the Moroccan 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose says he's not envious.  
</P>
<P>
	``No, I am just happy for them, I really am,'' he said. ``I know  
Sergio and David well -- I've played a lot of amateur golf with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've proved to me that (turning pro) was the right thing to  
do. You learn a lot as an amateur. But there's no reason why a 
young guy can't go out there and do it straight away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After struggling for a year on European courses, Rose now faces  
one of the toughest in golf. Players like Colin Montgomerie and 
U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart predict the winner could finish 16 
over par. But Rose insists his goal isn't just to make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I get judged on making cuts,'' he said. ``To make  
the cut here would be nice, don't get me wrong, and it is quite a 
big check for making the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the first step to doing well. I think that to make the  
cut you have to go out with aspirations to do much better.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Ends Down 25.96 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks dropped Tuesday as concerns about Latin  
America's economic recovery eroded investor optimism about 
second-quarter earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 25.96 to 11,175.02 after  
rallying from a 114-point drop in early trading. The Dow's loss 
came after the blue chip index hit new closing highs in three of 
the past four sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also declined. The Nasdaq composite  
index fell 12.21 to 2,778.23 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index 
slipped 5.54 to 1,393.56. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news of the earnings season is being overshadowed by  
concerns about Latin America,'' said Marshall Acuff, equity 
strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan, down 2 5/16 at 138 1/4 and Citigroup, off 1 1/16 at 47  
11/16, led the financial services sector lower on worries about its 
exposure to weak capital markets in Latin America. A strong 
earnings report wasn't enough to help the brokerage firm Paine 
Webber as its shares fell 3/8 to 45 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Latin American markets fell sharply Monday after  
Argentina's presidential candidates hinted at a possible moratorium 
on repayment of the country's debt. That raised concerns on Wall 
Street that U.S. financial services companies would suffer losses 
because of unpaid loans. 
</P>
<P>
	But most markets rebounded Tuesday. And U.S. Treasury prices,  
which rose markedly Monday as investors sought a safe haven, held 
steady Tuesday, helping to limit the extent of the selloff in 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the renewed economic uncertainty in Latin America,  
and the possibility of fallout in the United States, actually could 
be a blessing to investors because it might prevent the Federal 
Reserve from raising interest rates later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some U.S. companies rose on strong earnings reports, including  
Merrill Lynch, up 1 3/8 to 79 1/4, and the biotech firm Amgen, up 6 at 72 
5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were mostly lower. Dell Computer, the most  
active issue on the Nasdaq market, fell 1 3/8 to 42 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel was off 1/16 at 65 3/8, and then reported after the close of  
trading that its second-quarter profits came to 51 cents a share, 
below the 53 cents expected by Wall Street analysts. However, the 
news sent Intel falling only modestly, by 3/8 to 65, in after-hours 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble, a Dow stock, rose 1 15/16 to 88 15/16 after it  
announced a 12 percent increase in its quarterly dividend. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com rose 8 3/4 to 126 1/8 after announcing it is expanding its  
Web site to include toys and electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,281 up, 1,731 down and 562 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Composite NYSE volume totaled 896.43 million shares, up from  
856.55 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.15 to 653.64, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index dropped 3.21 to 812.33. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies slid 1.19 to 458.11. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.5 percent,  
Germany's DAX index was down 1.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was 
up 0.05 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 1.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Carnoustie Unique for Its `Length'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- The reputation of Carnoustie Golf  
Links is built around its length, and not just the 7,361 yards that 
make it the longest course in the 139-year history of the British 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Long also applies to the grass, which has grown so much that  
U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart is predicting an unusual windfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to make a lot of money when they cut and bale  
this hay out here, because the cows are going to eat very good this 
year,'' he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the week, long might also apply to the faces.  
</P>
<P>
	More than one player has offered a winning score of 300, a  
perfect day at the bowling alley but a miserable week for the best 
golfers in the world with the latest technological advances at 
their disposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnoustie is often referred to as ``Car-nasty,'' and it's not  
hard to see why. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fair test? Off the tee, it's arguable,'' Phil Mickelson  
said. ``I've never seen fairways as penalizing as that for a major 
championship. You might as well stick red hazard posts down the 
fairways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval suggested that every tournament ultimately comes  
down to putting. That certainly proved to be the case when Mark 
O'Meara beat him with three birdies on the last four holes in the 
1998 Masters, and when Stewart took three putts over the last three 
holes to win the U.S. Open last month at Pinehurst No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnoustie's challenge starts on the tee with a view that can  
look like a runway -- from 30,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still looking for the fairways,'' Duval said, gazing over  
his shoulder at the expanse of pot bunkers and wavy grass. ``I 
don't think you'll see drivers hit, not very many at least. I think 
you will see a lot of high numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vijay Singh played his first practice round and said his driver  
might not come out of the bag on the first nine holes. Stewart used 
a 2-iron off the tee on the 578-yard sixth hole -- anything to hit 
the fairway -- and said that strategy might not change unless the 
wind is at his back. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the hole where Ben Hogan found a tiny patch of fairway  
next to a bunker that he successfully navigated on his way to 
victory in the 1953 British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods bombed it over the bunkers during the Scottish Open  
in 1995 and 1996. Officials have since added another bunker some 
310 yards out to give the long hitters something else to consider -- 
as if the rough wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
	What it boils down to is an Open debate. Does Carnoustie favor  
the long hitter because of its 7,361 yards, or the accurate hitter 
because of its punishing rough on the skirts of already tight 
fairways. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Norman wasn't sure he had the answer.  
</P>
<P>
	``Length is a necessity, but accuracy is even more of a  
premium,'' Norman said. ``There are certain holes out there where 
you just have to hit driver. You've got 480-yard holes. If you hit 
off with a 2-iron or 3-wood, you're going in there with a 3-wood or 
a driver. And the way the greens are structured and situated, 
they're not conducive to 2-irons or 3-woods or drivers for second 
shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who comes into the British Open on the hottest streak of  
anyone, will take his length and see where that leads him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be an advantage because I will be able to hit  
a 2-iron or a 3-wood off the tee just as far as some of the guys 
can hit their drivers,'' Woods said. ``I believe that's a 
tremendous advantage in any tournament, period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For those who don't hit the ball as long as Woods -- take the  
field and subtract it by about five -- the prospects are daunting. 
Carnoustie demands a devilish combination of length and accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Experience doesn't mean a thing if you can't hit it  
straight,'' said Nick Faldo, a three-time champion playing in his 
23rd consecutive British Open. ``You've got to hit it down the 
middle of each fairway, and it's long as well. You've got to hit 
driver. And it's narrow. It's pretty serious out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it's not just the par 4s.  
</P>
<P>
	The 16th hole is a par-3 that measures 250 yards. During the  
final round of the 1968 British Open, Jack Nicklaus was the only 
player to get his tee shot past the hole. He used a driver. With 
the pin up front on Monday in only a mild breeze, Stewart hit it to 
15 feet with a 2-iron. He played Carnoustie in 1991 to prepare for 
the British Open and recalls using driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I didn't get there,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Then there is No. 6, the par 5. For those who choose to play it  
in three shots, perhaps they should consider the landing area for 
the layup -- a whopping 11 yards wide. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you hit it in the rough right now, you will be lucky to  
find the ball,'' Singh said. ``Used to be, when you played links 
courses you just try to avoid the fairway bunkers. Now, you try to 
avoid the rough and the fairway bunkers, which is a little too 
much, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be OK if you drive the ball in play,'' he said. ``Once  
you do that, I think you can play any game from there on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It just might not be a game with which anyone is familiar.

<HEADLINE> Japan Company Said Bowing on Nasdaq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tokyo (AP) -- Internet Initiative Japan, Inc., an Internet  
service provider, plans to go public on the U.S. stock market in 
what would be the first case of a Japanese company listing its 
shares overseas before it does so at home, a news report said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet Initiative Japan (IIJ) hopes to raise about $150  
million in its share offering, which may come as early as August on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading 
business daily, reported in its evening edition. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the company refused to either confirm or deny  
the report. 
</P>
<P>
	If the report is true, the move by IIJ to list its shares  
abroad, instead of at home, would be a blow to the standing of 
Japan's stock market, which is trying to raise its international 
competitiveness, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The news also comes just days after Japan's largest stock  
exchange said it will set up a new market for smaller start-up 
companies. The Tokyo Stock Exchange will open the new market early 
next year with relaxed listing requirements to attract smaller, 
lesser known companies that are now unable to raise money on 
Japan's financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai newspaper said IIJ is turning to the Nasdaq  
market because it is facing increasing competition from Japan's 
telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which, 
because of its size, can easily raise money to develop its Internet 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	IIJ was established in 1992 as the first domestic Internet  
access provider. The company has about 300 employees.

<HEADLINE> Caterpillar Debuts Small Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Caterpillar Inc. has always thought big.  
</P>
<P>
	Big as in earth-movers that crawl across the ground like Titans  
and are used to gut mountains. And big as in sales contracts that 
take a government appropriation to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	But now Caterpillar, the world's biggest maker of heavy  
equipment, is thinking small. That is small as in equipment that 
can be carried in the back of a pickup truck, rented for a day to 
dig a trench in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the Peoria-based manufacturer began shipping a new line  
of compact equipment -- inexpensive machines geared for small jobs 
and a market dominated by independent contractors. To reach those 
landscapers, electricians and plumbers, the company is hoping to 
rent them the machines -- a cheaper way to introduce the line -- 
through a host of Cat Rental Stores opening around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a radical shift away from Caterpillar's traditional  
business. But it is also a move into a market Caterpillar estimates 
to be worth $4 billion a year globally. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the construction economy cools off, both industry and  
Caterpillar analysts expect the small-equipment market to continue 
to thrive, partly because of changes in the culture of labor and 
the increased popularity of these tools. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are replacing manual labor. It is getting more difficult  
to find people willing to stand in a trench and put their hands on 
a pneumatic drill,'' said Bob Briggs, general manager of the plant 
in Sanford, N.C., where some of the equipment in Caterpillar's 
compact line is made. ``So you put a hammer on the front of a 
mini-excavator, and the guy sits back in the cab.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trophy of the Caterpillar line is the multipurpose  
skid-steer, a machine roughly the size of a small car, operated 
from a one-man cab. The skid-steer is considered the ``Swiss Army 
knife'' of contractor equipment for the wide range of tools that 
can be attached to its front -- from pumps to grinders to drills. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar took four years to develop the line, with 13 models  
of mobile equipment and 60 different types of ``work tools'' -- 
those attachments that make one loader useful for multiple jobs, 
such as cutting concrete, planting trees or loading pallets. 
</P>
<P>
	The average cost of $30,000 for a piece of compact equipment is  
far below the typical price of a Cat (the small Caterpillar D-6 
tractor goes for about $165,000), so the company hopes to see 
volume make up for a slimmer profit margin. 
</P>
<P>
	But Caterpillar has competition from the Ingersoll-Rand  
subsidiary of Melroe Co., which sells about half of all 
skid-steers, said Frank Manfredi, a heavy-equipment market analyst 
based in Mundelein, Ill. Melroe's best-known compact equipment is 
the popular Bobcat excavator. 
</P>
<P>
	``Melroe has publicly stated they won't be underpriced in this  
market,'' Manfredi said. ``I expect Cat to be competitive in its 
pricing, but probably put more emphasis on its service and 
features.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly what the company plans to do, Briggs said, with  
machines serviced by Caterpillar-trained mechanics and the variety 
of Caterpillar work tools available in the Cat Rental Stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a certain expectation from the (Caterpillar) name.  
Just because this is a new machine, and a smaller machine, we could 
not dilute the brand's expectation,'' Briggs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Emphasizing rentals is a big step for Caterpillar.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to get into this business and be responsive in a way  
that is different from our traditional way of business,'' said Bob 
Barrows, vice president of operations for Wagner Equipment Co., a 
Caterpillar dealer based in Aurora, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cat Rental Stores are key to reaching the contractor market.  
Owned by independent dealers, the stores are designed for 
contractors who expect to walk out with what they need -- a far cry 
from the sales contracts for the bigger machines that could take 
weeks or months to put together. 
</P>
<P>
	Other machines -- like the Melroe Bobcat -- have long been  
available for rent, but mostly through chain-operated rental yards 
like Hertz, where no brand is exclusive and the machines aren't 
maintained by company-trained workers. 
</P>
<P>
	With its own logo, its own sign and often its own location, the  
Cat Rental Store is meant to carry the compact equipment out of the 
shadow of the giant equipment yards where equipment managers for 
mining companies and state highway departments do business. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's such a huge customer base out there that doesn't own  
our equipment,'' said Mark Filipitch, supervisor of the Rental 
Services Division at Caterpillar. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just want to use it for a couple of days or a week. ...  
We knew if we developed this new product, we had to develop this 
new distribution system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner, which has five ``traditional'' Caterpillar sales yards,  
has opened 12 Cat Rental Stores, all fully stocked with 
mini-excavators, aerial platforms and skid-steers. Barrows said 
location is key to success. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the Cat Rental Stores, you need more facilities, you need  
to be close to the customer,'' Barrows said. ``These guys don't 
want to drive 100 miles to rent a piece of equipment for a day. 
They want to go to the edge of town.''

<HEADLINE> Women's Soccer Team Plays Big Apple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They are becoming regulars on the sidewalks of  
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	After rounds of television appearances and a night of  
celebration at a Chinese restaurant and nightclub, the U.S. women's 
soccer team was hailed one more time Tuesday at a midtown rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of ponytailed girls squealed at the players' every move  
and grown men dived for soccer bowls thrown into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The mostly male gathering gave its heartiest cheer for a framed  
photo of Brandi Chastain in her sports bra. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain's shot sent the United States to the Women's World Cup  
title Saturday, a 5-4 penalty-kicks victory over China after a 0-0 
tie. She then skidded to her knees and ripped off her jersey before 
a Rose Bowl crowd of 90,185. 
</P>
<P>
	After nonstop celebrations, the soccer bandwagon may have lost  
some of its steam Tuesday. Only a few hundred fans attended the 
rally, and attempts at a chant of ``USA, USA'' died quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was not enough to spoil the day for dozens of girls who  
couldn't wait to get a glimpse of Mia Hamm &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether men's soccer could compete for her attention,  
13-year-old Caitlin Cittarelli said there was no question. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows the women try harder,'' the Stratford, Conn.,  
girl replied. ``It's great because, I mean, they represent our 
country so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Bishop, 16, of suburban Malverne, has played soccer  
since kindergarten. She said she favors the women's team ``because 
they can actually win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players swapped jerseys with a handful of young fans who  
brought their own junior-sized uniform shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea what to say. I'm completely overwhelmed,''  
Chastain said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need you to be successful,'' she told the fans. ``Thank you  
very much for coming.''

<HEADLINE> Swiss Say Banking Secrecy Rules Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- The number of reports of suspected  
money laundering have quadrupled since Switzerland introduced rules 
last year aimed at cracking down on the practice, Swiss authorities 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The change in Switzerland's banking secrecy law, which came into  
force in April 1998, obliges bankers and other money managers to 
report suspected money laundering and freeze the assets in 
question. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which brought Switzerland up to basic international  
standards for dealing with money laundering, was enacted after a 
series of embarrassing episodes involving assets deposited in 
Switzerland by former foreign rulers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 210 cases involving a total of $268 million in assets have  
been reported by financial institutions, the Swiss Office of Police 
Affairs said. Before the law was tightened, 30 to 40 cases per year 
were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The number still appears low given Switzerland's importance as a  
financial center, police said. But the increase shows that the new 
law is working, said Daniel Thelesklaf, who heads the special 
police branch dealing with these cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of the cases have been passed on to state judicial  
authorities, but Thelesklaf cautioned it will be some time before 
the authorities produce results. In the other cases, authorities 
have found insufficient evidence of criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the vast majority of the cases -- 80 percent -- the assets had  
a foreign link, Thelesklaf said. Fraud is suspected in many cases, 
while only seven reports involved suspicions of drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to comply with the law brings a fine of $127,000.  
</P>
<P>
	One case leading up to the law came in 1997, when the country's  
high court ordered the transfer of assets belonging to the late 
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos to the Philippines. The court 
said it was against Swiss interests ``to serve as a safe haven'' 
for flight capital or criminal proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Also frozen in Switzerland pending legal action are assets  
belonging to the late Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole: No Two-For-One Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT DODGE, Iowa (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole said Tuesday that she and  
her husband, 1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole, don't believe 
in a two-for-one deal as she runs for the party's 2000 nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob and I have never felt that's the way it should be,'' she  
said during a campaign stop here. ``You are casting your vote for 
me, not for Bob, in this instance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first campaign for president, Bill Clinton said that with  
his wife's law degree and work experience, Americans would be 
electing two candidates for the price of one if they voted for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole said that if she is elected, her administration will  
not be ``a co-presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She joked she needs help in deciding what the title would be for  
the husband of the country's first woman president. 
</P>
<P>
	``First gentleman? First man? What?'' she asked. ``And any  
suggestions you have as to what his function should be also is wide 
open right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole said that her husband's experience as a senator,  
presidential candidate and advocate for the disabled makes him a 
valuable adviser to her. 
</P>
<P>
	``The man is very talented, so you certainly want to utilize  
that, but in a specific way,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	On other subjects, Mrs. Dole said that as president, she would  
outlaw the late-term abortion critics call ``partial-birth 
abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also said the nation's campaign finance laws need to be  
changed, with candidates required to disclose more of their 
financial records. But she said she thinks the $1,000 federal cap 
on individual campaign contributions needs to be raised, possibly 
to as high as $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The $1,000 that a person can give, that goes back to the  
1970s,'' she said. ``It doesn't even reflect the rate of 
inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During one of her campaign stops, a member of the audience asked  
her what she thinks about the proposals for gun registration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like it,'' she said. ``I don't think it's necessary.''  
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner, has  
suggested photo licenses for those who buy handguns. Gore's rival 
for the nomination, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, advocates 
that move, plus registration of all handguns in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole continued to offer veiled criticism of Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush, saying that she'll tell voters exactly where she 
stands on an issue.

<HEADLINE> Oil Cos. Criticize Tariff Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The country's biggest oil companies spoke out  
Tuesday against a coalition of small domestic producers who are 
asking the government to impose price tariffs on certain oil 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the major  
U.S. oil producers, said oil prices are set by world markets and 
there's no evidence that any of the foreign producing countries are 
illegally dumping oil on the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	The government can impose a tariff if an imported commodity is  
being sold at less than normal value or below what it costs to 
produce it. This practice is called illegal dumping. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, an Oklahoma-based coalition of independent oil  
producers calling itself Save Domestic Oil filed a petition with 
the Commerce Department charging Iraq, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and 
Venezuela with illegally dumping oil on the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was unprecedented and caught major U.S. oil companies,  
which generally have large overseas production as well, by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the big oil companies said they were ``sympathetic''  
to the economic problems of the small U.S. producers but 
nonetheless vowed to challenge the illegal dumping charge every 
step of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``This anti-dumping petition will only make matters worse  
because it will have the unintended consequence of making the oil 
supply system less efficient,'' API president Red Cavaney told 
reporters. He said that ``reliable historic information shows that 
prices are established by world oil markets'' and not illegal 
dumping strategies by certain producing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	As a first step, the API planned to challenge the idea that the  
Oklahoma-based group has legal standing to file an anti-dumping 
petition. By law, anyone filing a petition must demonstrate at 
least 25 percent of domestic production. 
</P>
<P>
	The API will argue before the U.S. International Trade  
Commission and the Commerce Department, which together deal with 
anti-dumping complaints, that U.S. production data shows that the 
Oklahoma group does not meet the 25 percent production requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	In its petition the Oklahoma group excluded the West Coast oil  
markets, including Alaska, where more than a quarter of U.S. oil is 
produced, mostly by major companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But API lawyers will argue that domestic production in those  
areas should be included in considering the dumping issue, making 
it more difficult to meet the 25 percent production rule. ``U.S. 
production is U.S. production,'' said Cavaney. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Hamm of Enid, Okla., chairman of Save Domestic Oil, did  
not immediately return a telephone call Tuesday seeking response to 
the API action. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oklahoma petition argued that regional domestic oil  
producers were economically harmed by these ``unfairly traded 
imports'' and threaten to cause additional harm if the U.S. 
government does not intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	The Independent Petroleum Association of America, the principle  
organization of small and medium gas and oil companies, estimates 
the domestic oil industry has lost 52,000 jobs and shut down 
136,000 oil wells since November, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Trade Commission was expected to decide on the  
Oklahoma group's standing in early August. If the commission finds 
the petition to be valid, it will decide on whether the domestic 
industry has been harmed by illegal dumping. The Commerce 
Department then would decide on an import duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavaney made clear that even if the large oil companies lose the  
first round, they intend to challenge the dumping argument on its 
merits. 
</P>
<P>
	An import tariff would mean higher prices for U.S. consumers  
because imports would shift from targeted countries to other 
producers whose oil may be more expensive or of inferior quality, 
he said. ``Over the long term, it's difficult to see who would 
benefit from this action.''

	Alleged Railway Killer in Custody  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, the rail-riding  
fugitive suspected of killing eight people who lived along railway 
lines, is in FBI custody in Texas, a spokeswoman said today. The 
39-year-old drifter is charged in two murders and linked to six 
other slayings. One FBI official said Resendez-Ramirez turned 
himself in to law enforcement officers near El Paso, Texas. The 
official said members of his family helped arrange his surrender. 
His ability to elude law enforcement had been an embarrassment, 
topped by his release to Mexico by Border Patrol agents June 2, 
although he was wanted by the FBI and Houston police had told the 
immigration service they wanted him for questioning in a murder.

	Indictments Coming in ValuJet Crash  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A federal grand jury investigating the 1996 crash  
of ValuJet Flight 592 will indict the airline's maintenance 
contractor and some employees, an unprecedented step in an aviation 
accident, Justice Department sources said today. Indictments will 
name several individuals involved in the packing of the illegal 
cargo blamed for the crash. Investigators found that workers for 
ValuJet's maintenance contractor, SabreTech Inc., improperly packed 
oxygen canisters that were loaded into the cargo hold. A fire 
burned through the floor of the passenger cabin, causing the DC-9 
to plunge into the Everglades, killing 110 people.

	Clinton, Congress Argue Over HMOs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accused Republicans today of  
buckling under pressure from health insurance companies and backing 
a ``watered-down'' plan to protect people in health-maintenance 
organizations. ``It is nowhere near what the American people 
deserve and need,'' Clinton said. The GOP bill is a much more 
modest version of the Democratic ``patients' bill of rights,'' 
covering fewer people and leaving out the right to sue if a patient 
is harmed by a denial of care. Debate began yesterday on the bill 
and a final vote on the entire bill is set for Thursday.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia has agreed to limit shipments of steel

punitive American tariffs, Commerce Secretary William Daley 
announced today. ``These agreements deliver on the administration's 
commitment to guarantee that surging imports do not threaten the 
livelihoods of communities and workers around the nation,'' Daley 
said. The two sides signed the agreements covering different types 
of steel following bargaining talks in Paris. The deals will set 
annual quotas for Russian steel shipments, reducing imports for all 
Russian steel shipments by 64 percent this year compared to 1998, 
the department said.

survivor. The gunman killed his mother, aunt and four siblings. The 
boy allegedly told a neighbor that his stepfather had shot

	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The afternoon Indianapolis News will shut

the newspaper, Dale A. Duncan, president and publisher of the News 
and The Indianapolis Star, said in a statement. The Oct. 1 edition 
will be the last. According to the most recent figures, the average 
daily circulation for The Indianapolis News for the six-month

penalty kicks chagrined Chinese fans. But their sorrow has been 
tempered by pride that China's women made it to the finals and held 
the Americans scoreless in regular play. ``You didn't disappoint 
the wishes of the masses,'' Jiang said during a reception at the 
Great Hall of the People in Beijing. ``You showed on the playing 
field the self-reliance and self-confidence of Chinese women.''

<HEADLINE> Ohio Killing Spree Suspect Captured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIDNEY, Ohio (AP) -- A man suspected of killing three teen-age  
girls and a Bible teacher surrendered Tuesday after taking three 
people hostage at a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Michael Hensley was spotted in a car loaded with guns  
shortly after a driver was wounded on a nearby highway. He led 
police on a chase and took hostages at a filling station before 
surrendering at 5 a.m., authorities said. The hostages were not 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Hensley, 30, has been sought since the deaths of his neighbor,  
Sherry Kimbler, 16, Tosha L. Barrett, 16, and Amy Mikesell, 14, who 
were all found dead in Hensley's home Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also wanted in the death of Brett Wildermuth, 37, a  
Bible-study teacher who had helped minister to Hensley. Police say 
Hensley killed the girls, then drove with his wife to Wildermuth's 
house for a prayer session and shot him. 
</P>
<P>
	Hensley was charged with four counts of aggravated murder and  
ordered held on $1 million cash bond during a brief court 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's drama began shortly before 3 a.m. when a man driving  
on Interstate 75 was shot by a passing motorist. A few minutes 
later, about a mile away, a shot was fired at the home of John 
Bruce, one of Hensley's Bible-study teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers giving chase said Hensley pulled into a gas station in  
Sidney, about 35 miles north of Dayton, jumped out and ran inside. 
Hensley took two men hostage. A female clerk locked herself in an 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	After telephone negotiations over the next hour, Hensley  
released the hostages unharmed and emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel relief, like tons of bricks have been lifted off my  
shoulders,'' said 15-year-old Mindy Swiger, who lived near Hensley 
and was a classmate of one of the teen-age victims. 
</P>
<P>
	No motive for the shootings has been provided by police. The  
Dayton Daily News reported Hensley was twice convicted in four 
years for public indecency. 
</P>
<P>
	His pastor, the Rev. Ben Davis of the First Church of God, said  
Hensley had been involved in devil worship but was trying to mend 
his ways. 
</P>
<P>
	The shot motorist was in serious condition, according to  
officials.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Plans First Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Getting into the real nitty gritty of  
politics, Hillary Rodham Clinton has begun raising money for 
herself for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman said Monday that Mrs. Clinton has begun dialing for  
dollars from the White House for her Senate campaign in New York 
and will have her first fund-raising event this week in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Wolfson said Mrs. Clinton has been making calls to  
potential donors from the residential quarters of the White House 
using a private phone line or a personal cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you three things'' about the fund raising, Wolfson  
said. ``One is, it's a necessity. Two is, it's going very well. 
And, three is, that it's all being done appropriately and 
legally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore came under heavy  
criticism for fund-raising activities during their 1996 re-election 
campaign and several of their fund-raisers have faced criminal 
charges in connection with that. The Democratic National Committee 
had to return $3 million in donations from the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfson refused to say how much money Mrs. Clinton has raised.  
She formed her exploratory committee last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfson said Mrs. Clinton would hold a $1,000-a-person event in  
Manhattan on Thursday morning for fewer than 100 people. That 
session will also serve as an organizational meeting for her 
fund-raising efforts with those on hand forming her core group of 
campaign fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those expected to attend the event are Wall Street tycoon  
Roger Altman, who was deputy treasury secretary during President 
Clinton's first term, and millionaire businessman Erskine Bowles, a 
former White House chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton spent part of Monday in New York working on her  
fund-raising effort. Her campaign is expected to cost $20 million.

<HEADLINE> Fans Flock to Fenway for Big Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Unshaved and haggard, David Deems walked slowly  
around Fenway Park, a sign in his hand and a dream in his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Came from China 4 a ticket,'' the sign read.  
</P>
<P>
	Deems, 31, wore a tired smile as he described the long flight  
from Shanghai to New York, then the trip to Boston on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here to see the history of baseball,'' Deems said. ``I've  
got to get around to all these old ballparks before they die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Deems, a Cleveland native, the visit to 87-year-old Fenway  
Park for the All-Star Game was the latest chapter in a personal 
mission that included a stop at Chicago's Comiskey Park three days 
before it closed, as well as visits to Detroit's Tiger Stadium and 
Cleveland's Municipal Stadium during their final seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Others among the thousands of fans milling past the program  
vendors on Yawkey Way and beneath the shadow of the Green Monster 
on Lansdowne Street echoed the sentiment that somehow, Fenway Park 
was different from all those antiseptic modern ballparks named for 
high-tech companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenway belongs to an older generation, a time when players wore  
mitts barely bigger than their hands and chewed wads of tobacco as 
big as baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just seems like a very friendly, very personal place,''  
said Greg Packer, 34, who took a bus from Long Island and slept on 
a park bench for a chance to score a ticket. ``There's less of that 
around in today's world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Packer, like thousands of others, was still without a ticket as  
Pedro Martinez threw the first pitch of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	So was Scott Marathas, 27, who flew up from Orlando, Fla., for  
the game. Marathas didn't seem to mind, as he held up a single 
finger showing that he was looking for one ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is it! I'm at Fenway Park for the All-Star Game, for  
God's sakes!'' said Marathas, a lifelong Red Sox fan who grew up in 
New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Marathas, a trainer for an Internet television company, said  
people had offered to sell him tickets worth $175 for as much as 
$2,500. He said he hoped ticket prices would sink as the game went 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	Just up Yawkey Way, Gus Farian was no luckier. Farian, four days  
short of his 75th birthday, wore a special shirt made to improve 
his chances of getting a ticket. ``Help me celebrate my 75th 
birthday. I need a ticket!'' the shirt said. 
</P>
<P>
	By game time, Farian, who had been slowly circling the park for  
4 1/2 hours, hadn't had any offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things are tough,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Just then, a young man in a blue sports shirt walked by and  
handed him a $100 ticket to the game.

<P>
	Farian tried to pay the man, but he kept walking. ``No, no, just  
enjoy the game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farian, a wide smile on his face and a bounce in his step,  
joined the throngs filing through the turnstiles -- an aging man 
turned young by the promise of a timeless game in a classic 
ballpark.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Unaffected by a night of dining and dancing,  
members of the World Cup-winning U.S. women's soccer team today 
welcomed a few hundred fans in midtown by thanking them for their 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea what to say. I'm completely overwhelmed,'' said  
Brandi Chastain, who scored the game-winning penalty kick on 
Saturday. ``We need you to be successful, so thank you very much 
for coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players swapped jerseys with a handful of young girls, while  
others in the crowd were just happy to see their idols. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great because, I mean, they represent our country so  
well,'' said Caitlin Cittarelli, a 13-year-old soccer player for 
her hometown of Stratford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if she favors the women's team over their male  
counterparts, the teen quickly replied, ``The women. Everybody 
knows the women try harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women's soccer team will return to the city next week  
for an appearance on ``Late Show with David Letterman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The get-together marked day two of the champions' visit to New  
York. The first day stretched late into the night as the women 
danced with their fans at The China Club. Earlier, some of them 
enjoyed a dinner of Chinese food. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuisine and nightlife choices were just coincidence and were  
not intended as jabs at the defeated Chinese team, insisted backup 
U.S. goalkeeper Saskia Webber with a slight grin. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, it has nothing to do with it,'' she said Monday night as  
she and a handful of teammates entered the China Grill in midtown 
Manhattan to a standing ovation from patrons. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the diners was Jim Hook, a youth soccer referee from  
Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous thrill,'' he gushed. ``All my kids love  
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another diner, lawyer Lisa Babiskin, was thrilled to meet the  
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should absolutely go out and celebrate their  
accomplishment,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After dinner, around 11 p.m., eight of the players headed to The  
China Club, a celebrity nightclub in midtown Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain said she and the other players worked hard to win the  
World Cup and needed a relaxing night of boogieing to disco tunes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight we just want to forget about being soccer players and  
listen to the music,'' she said at the club at about 12:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a good time just dancing,'' Webber said as the players'  
partying drew to a close about 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The club's disc jockey congratulated the players, who bumped  
hips with each other and friends on the crowded dance floor while 
other clubgoers applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-week World Cup tournament ended Saturday at the Rose  
Bowl in Los Angeles, setting off their whirlwind of activities. The 
players were welcomed at Disneyland on Sunday, then flew overnight, 
landing at Newark Airport in New Jersey at 4:30 a.m. and piling on 
a bus to Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun,'' said Mia Hamm, the U.S. team's biggest star. ``I  
love New York. There's so many things to do and so many things to 
see.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Negro League Star Kimbro Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Henry Kimbro, a Negro League outfielder  
known as the ``black Ty Cobb,'' has died at age 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimbro, who died Sunday, batted .320 over 18 seasons. He played  
from 1934 to 1951 for the Nashville Elite Giants, the Washington 
Elite Giants, the New York Black Yankees, the Baltimore Elite 
Giants and the Birmingham Black Barons. He hit .393 for Baltimore 
in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw him swing at the first pitch the whole time that I  
knew him,'' said Butch McCord of Nashville, who played with Kimbro 
on the 1949 Negro National League champion in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Walker, who operates the Old Negro League Baseball Shop in  
Nashville, said Kimbro played with Roy Campanella and against Negro 
League legends like Josh Gibson, Buck Leonard and Satchel Paige. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the greatest Negro League players that ever  
lived,'' Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	After his baseball career, Kimbro returned to his native  
Nashville and became a successful businessman, founding Bill's Cab 
taxi service which he ran for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He died at home after being in declining health for about a  
month. Survivors include his wife, three daughters, two sons and 
two sisters. Funeral services are Wednesday at Patterson Memorial 
United Methodist Church in Nashville.

<HEADLINE> SLA Capture Reopens Calif. Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The capture of a former Symbionese  
Liberation Army member has prompted California authorities to 
reopen an investigation into a 1975 bank robbery in which a woman 
was shot and killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities suspect Kathleen Soliah was one of the masked  
robbers who stormed the Crocker Bank branch in Carmichael, Calif., 
on April 21, 1975. A 42-year-old bank customer was killed in the 
holdup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want Kathleen to be aware that we're not rolling over  
playing dead here,'' Detective Bob Bell of the Sacramento County 
Sheriff's Department said in today's Saint Paul Pioneer Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our first hope that she would just cooperate,'' he said.  
``In the absence of that, we're going to continue to work the case 
to make sure she suffers the consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah, 52, spent 23 years as a fugitive before FBI agents  
captured her last month in St. Paul, where she was married to a 
physician and the mother of three daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah is due in a Los Angeles courtroom Wednesday to face  
conspiracy charges that could mean life in prison if she is 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	In the charges she already faces, she is accused of placing pipe  
bombs under two Los Angeles police cars in retaliation for a 1974 
shootout with police in which six SLA members were killed. The 
bombs did not go off. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLA was the radical group that kidnapped newspaper heiress  
Patricia Hearst that same year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hearst wrote about the bank shooting in her memoir, ``Every  
Secret Thing.'' She said Ms. Soliah was one of the SLA members 
inside the bank, and that another SLA member, Emily Harris, 
accidentally shot the woman who was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course she denies it,'' Ms. Soliah's attorney, Stuart  
Hanlon, said Monday. ``The only person who ever said that is Patty 
Hearst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only one person -- Soliah's brother Steven -- was ever charged in  
the case, and he was acquitted. Bell said authorities have been 
unable to bring other charges because witness accounts are confused 
and former SLA members have refused to cooperate. Ms. Hearst's 
statements would be inadmissible unless they were corroborated, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A son of bank slaying victim Myrna Lee Opsahl said Monday that  
if officials don't have any real evidence about Soliah's 
involvement in the heist and attempted pipe bombings, they 
shouldn't be taking her away from her children. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if they have any reasonable evidence, they should pursue  
it -- that's their job,'' said Dr. Roy Opsahl, who was 12 when his 
mother was killed. ``I would love to have the murder solved.''

<HEADLINE> Irish Eyes Smiling on U.S. Golfers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Tom Watson will be a captain of one  
of the most storied golf courses in Ireland next year. Payne 
Stewart got such a fine reception in one Irish town that he wonders 
how he would fare in a race for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to the British Open, Americans are finding Ireland  
to be a home away from home. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, Tiger Woods, David Duval, Lee Janzen and Mark O'Meara  
were among those who spent five days playing links golf in Ireland 
the week before the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think David was playing the best,'' Woods said.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the courses they played was the K Club, site of the 2005  
Ryder Cup matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a lot of fun. The camaraderie was very special,''  
Stewart said. ``We played a scramble. Tiger was on my team, so how 
many times do you think they used my drive?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was more valuable playing his harmonica in the pubs at  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if I ran for mayor at Waterville, it would be a  
landslide,'' Stewart said. ``I don't know why they have accepted me 
so much, but we have a very good time. We get into the pub and we 
get on the piano, and I bring my harmonicas out and the next thing 
you know it's about 4 o'clock in the morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While most players bounce around from course to course in a  
helicopter, Watson prefers to cross bodies of water in a ferry and 
then drive through the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't see it very well from a helicopter,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Watson's fondest memory this year was at Ballybunion, where the  
club was trying to raise money for a young professional trying to 
qualify for the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``People just started singing. They had a microphone and went  
around the room, and it was beautiful,'' he said. ``The problem was 
they asked me if I wanted to sing. I love to sing, but I wasn't 
going to get up there and embarrass myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That will change next year, when Watson becomes a captain -- an  
honorary position in which he will represent the club for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be required to sing, so I better find a good song,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He then belted out the first line of ``When Irish eyes are  
smiling.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *YOUTH IS SERVED:* Zane Scotland, the 16-year-old who became the  
youngest qualifier in British Open history, was first discovered 
two years ago when Sky Sports and the Sun newspaper held a 
competition to find Britain's answer to Tiger Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Scotland competed in a nine-hole tournament using the Stableford  
format and beat 12 other players to win a trip to the 1997 Ryder 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked at the time about whether he'd like to be a pro, Scotland  
said, ``Hopefully, if I do well in my exams at school, I'd like to 
advance to college golf in America and see how it goes from 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he sticks to that plan, he'll have a friend in Payne Stewart.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he doesn't turn pro if he finishes third,'' Stewart  
said when told that a 16-year-old had qualified for the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, 17-year-old Justin Rose tied for fourth, turned pro  
and missed his first 22 cuts as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MONTY'S TUNES:* It's safe to say that Colin Montgomerie and  
Mark Calcavecchia have different tastes in tunes. 
</P>
<P>
	When Calcavecchia won the 1998 Honda Classic, he listened to the  
Rolling Stones during his drive from West Palm Beach to Coral 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie has been staying in the Gleneagles Hotel this week,  
about an hour's drive. His choice of music? Abba and Elton John. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my wife's tape. It's stuck in there,'' Montgomerie  
offered. ``OK, we're all Abba fans, aren't we? Most of it is 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he would be wearing bell bottoms, Montgomerie  
laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, but I'll leave the white boots off,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WATSON MEMORIES:* Of all the horror stories told of Carnoustie,  
Tom Watson has one that dates to before he won the Open in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nicklaus told him of a made-for-television event in the  
1960s between Nicklaus, Gary Player and Arnold Palmer. The wind 
blew about 40 mph and the course was baked out. Nicklaus had a 77, 
Player a 78 and Palmer finished with a 79. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's nothing unusual,'' Watson thought.  
</P>
<P>
	Then they counted how many greens were hit in regulation.  
Nicklaus led with four, Player hit two and Palmer putted for a 
birdie only once. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, if you add the rough to it and you add the length to it,  
and you add the wind to it ... now what's going to happen?'' Watson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Lee Westwood has a prank or two up his sleeve. He  
agreed to be interviewed on an English radio station Tuesday 
morning, and the host panicked when Westwood let the phone ring for 
more than a minute -- then answered it as if he were the owner of a 
Chinese restaurant. .... While there have been several reports of 
luggage being delayed on flights to Scotland, save the sympathy for 
Mitch Knox. The caddie for David Duval walked 14 holes to get a 
look at Carnoustie, followed by an 18-hole round with Duval, 
wearing his black hiking boots. ... Eight players have won half of 
the 38 major championships this decade. Scott Hoch, Jeff Maggert 
and Phil Mickelson have the most top-10s in majors in the '90s -- 
nine -- without having won.

<HEADLINE> Ted Williams Gets All-Star Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- It was a baseball love-in on the mound, the stars  
of the night and the stars of the century swamping Ted Williams, 
gazing at him in awe, reaching over each other to shake his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	He rode out in a golf cart from center field at the All-Star  
game after they'd all been introduced -- Aaron and Mays, Feller and 
Musial from summers past, McGwire and Sosa, Ripken and Griffey from 
Tuesday night's lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Players watched as the adoring crowd stood and cheered him, the  
roar almost as loud as the jets that buzzed Fenway Park after the 
national anthem. And they watched Williams respond by waving his 
cap, a gesture he never made as a player, even after he homered in 
his final game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gods don't answer letters,'' John Updike wrote of that moment  
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, a baseball god did.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams was often booed by Fenway fans during his playing days,  
but now no one is more popular in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hell, I haven't had a base hit in 30 years, and I'm a better  
hitter now than I've ever been in my life,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 80-year-old Williams waved all the way down the right field  
line as the golf cart proceeded toward the mound. Even the 
policemen ringing the field applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, spontaneously, the players, young and old, closed  
ranks on him, moving in to be as close as possible to the last man 
to hit .400 -- .406 in 1941 -- and who is arguably the greatest 
hitter in history. 
</P>
<P>
	They formed a huge huddle on the mound, no one wanting to leave,  
no one caring if the ceremony or the game was delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams rose gingerly from the cart -- two strokes and a broken  
hip in recent years make it hard for him to walk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where's Sammy?'' Williams bellowed, calling for Sosa, then  
shaking his hand. Williams wore a big smile and seemed to want to 
reach out to all of them. He grabbed Mark McGwire's shoulder and 
spoke with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward Williams recounted what he said:  
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted me to meet (Don) Mattingly when he was going good,  
and (Wade) Boggs. And we went to this high-class restaurant and 
we're talking about hitting, the intimate part of hitting, where 
you put your foot, everything like that. Finally, I said, 'Did you 
guys ever smell the wood when you foul one real hard?' 
</P>
<P>
	``They looked at one another, like what's this guy smoking now?  
And I said I could smell it quite a few times, and it smelled like 
wood burning. I said the next time I see Willie Mays, the next time 
I see Cepeda, the next time I see Reggie Jackson, I'm going to ask 
them. They said, `Oh, sure, we've smelled it, too.' So I asked 
McGwire the same thing, and he said he could smell it, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams wanted to keep talking, but time and his own emotions  
wouldn't allow it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to talk baseball with everybody out there,'' McGwire  
said, adding that a lot of players got choked up. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Walker of the Rockies was one of them.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tears were coming out of Ted's eyes. I had to turn away  
because tears were coming out my eyes, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the players backed away and Williams took the ball to  
throw out the ceremonial first pitch to Carlton Fisk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where is he?'' Williams asked. His vision, once the best in  
the game, has suffered, too, and he can't see well outside a narrow 
range. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Gwynn pointed him toward Fisk and held him steady.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got you,'' Gwynn said.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams joked a bit, then tossed a soft pitch to Fisk, inside  
but all the way to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk jogged to the mound to hug him.  
</P>
<P>
	Other players came back to crowd around Williams, and after a  
few minutes the public address announcer pleaded with the players 
to return to the dugout. The game was running late, but no one 
wanted this moment to end. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of funny,'' Boston shortstop Nomar Garciaparra  
said. ``When the announcer asked everybody to go back to the 
dugout, everybody said no. It didn't matter. What time was the 
first pitch? Nobody cared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Rafael Palmeiro: ``That's the chance of a lifetime. The  
game can wait ... We had chills all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a scene reminiscent of Muhammad Ali lighting the Olympic  
torch at the start of the 1996 Atlanta Games -- Ali shaking, the 
crowd cheering wildly, the greatest athletes in the world staring 
at him in awe. When Ali later made the rounds of the games, even 
athletes like Michael Jordan fawned over him. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the way it was with these all-stars and Williams, an  
all-star himself for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
	To a man, the players expressed a sense of reverence about the  
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Meeting Ted Williams was probably the greatest thrill of my  
career,'' Cleveland's Jim Thome said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Williams was helped back into the cart, and the crowd  
roared again until he made his way to his box seat along the first 
base line with commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wasn't it great!'' Williams said. ``I can only describe it as  
great. It didn't surprise me all that much because I know how these 
fans are here in Boston. They love this game as much as any players 
and Boston's lucky to have the faithful Red Sox fans. They're the 
best.''

<HEADLINE> Capel Helps U.S. to Relay Sweep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) -- This U.S. men's  
sprint relay team finally got it right, and led a gold sweep for 
the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising stars John Capel, Coby Miller and their teammates avoided  
the baton blunders that have derailed the United States at major 
events recently, and won the 400-meter relay at the World 
University Games on Tuesday in 38.55 seconds, the fifth fastest 
time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa was second in 39.08 and Italy finished third in  
39.31. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States also triumphed in the women's 400 relay and  
both 1,600 relays as the 11-day Olympics-style event wrapped up at 
Son Moix Stadium. The Americans won the men's 1,600 in 3:00.88, the 
third fastest time of 1999, to beat Britain by more than 3 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Other winners Tuesday were Kenya's Bernard Lagat in the 1,500  
meters, Eriks Rags in the javelin for Latvia's only medal of the 
games, and Britain's Ben Challenger in the high jump. Among the 
women, Rie Ueno of Japan won easily in the 5,000, while Olena 
Shekhovisova of Ukraine took the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Flubbing relays in big meets has become commonplace for American  
400-meter teams in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the World Championships two years ago, they blew the first  
handoff, between leadoff runner Brian Lewis and Tim Montgomery, in 
the first round. They failed to finish their first-round heat at 
the 1995 World Championships, when Jon Drummond and substitute Tony 
McCall failed to connect on the second exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	They were disqualified at the 1988 Olympics because of a handoff  
outside the zone, and were beaten by Canada at the 1996 Atlanta 
Games -- the only U.S. 400 relay Olympic loss other than by 
disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with the U.S. in relays is the short time they  
have to work together. In the long relay it's not a problem, but in 
short relay it is,'' said Clyde Hart, who like the rest of the U.S. 
track coaches here will also guide the team at the 2000 Sydney 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very proud of our guys here. This is the team of the  
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men's 400 victory marked a measure of redemption for Capel,  
the track and football standout from the University of Florida, who 
finished a disappointing second to Brazil's Andre Domingos Da Silva 
in the 100 dash here Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A rematch in the relay never materialized, though, because  
Brazil dropped the baton in the first exchange and Da Silva didn't 
get the chance to challenge Capel in the anchor leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not worried about the Brazilian. I know he's not faster  
than me,'' said Capel, who starts football practice with Florida 
Friday. ``The Brazilian said that we cannot run, that we talk too 
much trash. So we proved that we can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller added the gold to his earlier triumph in the 200 meters,  
while Terrence Trammell, who ran the second leg Tuesday, had 
already won gold here in the 110-meter hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 400 relay, U.S. anchor Nanceen Perry pulled away  
from Poland's Zuzanna Radecka down the stretch. Angela Williams, 
who won the women's 100 dash Sunday, Torri Edwards and Lakeisha 
Backus completed the American quartet, which finished in 43.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Poland took the silver in 43.74, with Germany third in 43.96.  
</P>
<P>
	The United States took the women's 1,600 in 3:27.97.  
</P>
<P>
	The five American medals Tuesday -- Adrien Sawyer took silver in  
the women's long jump -- brought the country's total to a games-high 
63, 30 gold. Russia finished second overall with 43 medals, 14 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said a record total of 4,030 athletes participated in  
the 12 sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2001 Summer University Games are in Beijing, China.

<HEADLINE> Congressional Comics Get Web Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Want to while away a summer afternoon with a  
nearly century-old animated comic strip? Well, the Library of 
Congress is at your service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Krazy Kat'' is there, the strip President Wilson was said to  
read before Cabinet meetings, and also ``The Katzenjammer Kids'' 
and ``Keeping Up With the Joneses.'' There are 21 animated films 
and two fragments, covering the years 1900 to 1921. 
</P>
<P>
	And they're available to anyone with a computer via the  
Internet. To find them go to the Library of Congress Web site, 
http://www.loc.gov, and click on American Memory. Then search for the 
keyword animation. 
</P>
<P>
	The earliest is Thomas A. Edison's ``The Enchanted Drawing.'' In  
less than a minute and a half, it shows what the inventor's catalog 
called ``an elderly gentleman of most comical features and 
expression pouring wine out of the bottle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These films also reveal some of the social attitudes of early  
20th century America,'' the library said in its announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	For the more active, the library site also offers dancing  
lessons. It has put ``An American Ballroom Companion'' on the Web 
with extracts from more than 200 books. They describe social 
dancing back to the time of Columbus. Video demonstrations allow 
the student to compare printed instructions with actual movements. 
</P>
<P>
	No macarena, though -- the dance manuals only go up to 1920.  
</P>
<P>
	Collections display presidential papers, Civil War photos, 1,500  
images from what the library calls ``the golden age of jazz'' and 
an outstanding assemblage of baseball cards. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Digital Library now has about 2 million items in 60  
separate collections and expects to have 6 million next year when 
the Library of Congress celebrates it 200th birthday. That compares 
with 18 million books in the stacks and nearly 100 million other 
items such as maps and photos. 
</P>
<P>
	A digitized ``Southern Mosaic'' presents 25 hours of folk music  
collected 60 years ago by John and Ruby Lomax -- nearly 700 songs, 
over 100 of them in Spanish. The couple traveled 6,502 miles 
through eight Southern states for material. They came up with a 
unique collection of ballads, blues, children's songs, cowboy 
songs, fiddle tunes, hollers, lullabies, religious dramas, 
spirituals and work songs. 
</P>
<P>
	When the library's geography division put together a collection  
called ``Mapping the National Parks,'' it found maps of the areas 
going back 400 years, centuries before there was such a thing as a 
national park. It covers four parks, including the Acadia National 
Park in Maine, the first coastal park, and adds the appropriate 
nautical charts. 
</P>
<P>
	Links from the Grand Canyon presentation carry the viewer to  
spectacular views of the site.

<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The woman who accused President Clinton of  
making a sexual advance in the White House six years ago is engaged 
to be married. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Willey said she is preparing for a fall wedding to  
longtime friend Bill Schwicker, who proposed in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to get married and try to put all this behind me,''  
she told The Associated Press on Tuesday. ``It's all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Willey said Clinton groped her in 1993 near the Oval Office,  
one day before her husband was found dead of a self-inflicted 
gunshot wound. He had been distraught over financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has denied any such encounter.  
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the magazine Style Weekly, Ms. Willey said  
she fled to Schwicker's home in Florida to duck the press last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a while it was indescribable,'' she said. ``I got to the  
point where I found it laughable what people would say and do to 
get me to talk.'' 
</P>

	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura has slapped down any  
suggestion that his return to wrestling threatens the dignity of 
his office. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no rule that says a governor can't have fun. There's  
no rule that says a governor on his own time can't be a human,'' he 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, who wrestled professionally as ``The Body'' until  
retiring in 1986, has hinted that he may return to the ring Aug. 22 
at Target Center in Minneapolis. The sold-out ``SummerSlam'' event 
will be on pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura refused to discuss details of the event, though he has  
said a contribution would go to two charities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The perception is that people need to be professional  
politicians and that therefore being a politician is your entire 
life. Well, it's not Jesse Ventura's entire life and I think I was 
elected upon the fact that I came from being a private citizen,'' 
said Ventura, a Reform Party politician. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, state GOP Chairman Ron Eibensteiner called the  
governor's return to the ring ``an absolute outrage'' and said 
Ventura was ``using the office of governor to promote his own 
personal enrichment.'' 
</P>

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The surgeon who reshaped Paula Jones' nose has  
been sued by his office assistant, who claims he demanded sex as a 
condition for keeping her job. 
</P>
<P>
	Christine Sabia said in court papers that immediately after Dr.  
Thomas W. Loeb did Mrs. Jones' surgery in July 1998, he went into 
his office, dropped his pants and demanded oral sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabia, 36, also said Loeb had planned to videotape Mrs. Jones'  
surgery and sell it to the highest-bidding tabloid. The suit did 
not say whether the videotape was made. 
</P>
<P>
	Loeb admitted he had an affair with Sabia but said it was brief,  
consensual and initiated by her. Loeb said he ended the affair and 
Sabia has been demanding money ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	``The easiest thing to do would have been to pay her off, but I  
was not willing to be extorted,'' Loeb said Tuesday. ``I trust in 
our legal system and I'm sure I'll be vindicated in court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sabia said in papers filed in Manhattan's State Supreme Court  
that she submitted to Loeb for nearly nine months because she 
needed the salary. Her lawsuit asks for unspecified damages and 
attorneys' fees.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rocky's contentious two-year court battle is  
over. 
</P>
<P>
	Sylvester Stallone and his brother settled breach-of-contract  
lawsuits with two entertainment firms over the movie ``The Good 
Life,'' which starred Frank Stallone and featured a cameo by the 
star of ``Rocky'' and ``Rambo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement between DEM Productions Inc., FM Entertainment and  
the Stallone brothers was reached Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the settlement were confidential, said Frank Stallone's  
attorney, Barry Cohen. A DEM attorney didn't return a telephone 
message left Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stallones filed separate lawsuits against the entertainment  
companies in 1997. DEM and FM Entertainment filed a $50 million 
countersuit against the brothers saying they ``behaved like the 
gangsters they portray.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The countersuit said the Stallones tried unsuccessfully to take  
over production of ``The Good Life'' and later tried to destroy 
DEM. The brothers denied the charges.

<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan has joined 13 other states in a  
suit against entertainer Robin Leach and two Florida companies, 
claiming they misled consumers about tropical vacation packages. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan Attorney General Jennifer Granholm said Tuesday that  
Ramada Plaza Resorts and National Travel Services of Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla., mailed ``official-looking'' documents telling 
consumers they had won a Florida vacation and a cruise to the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Accommodations were described as ``world class,'' Granholm said.  
Leach, best known for the TV series ``Lifestyles of the Rich and 
Famous,'' endorsed the travel package. 
</P>
<P>
	Granholm said consumers actually won a chance to pay $1,000 for  
a 7-day trip to Florida. The cruise to the Bahamas consisted of a 
ride on a car ferry, she said, and ``Las Vegas-style'' gambling was 
a game of bingo. 
</P>
<P>
	Granholm said the companies also failed to tell participants  
that they would have to sit through a lengthy presentation on 
timeshares. ``Having to sit through a sales presentation and pay 
inflated prices for a `free' vacation is nothing more than a 
scam,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Epstein, an attorney representing Leach and the two  
companies, did not return a message Tuesday. A spokesperson for 
Leach has said that the entertainer cut his ties with the Florida 
companies last year.

<HEADLINE> Women Urge Senators About Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A diverse mix of 30 groups involved with  
women's and children's issues, including the National Organization 
for Women and Church Women United, are urging senators to oppose 
legislation that would make it tougher to erase debts through 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups signed a letter sent to the 100 members of the  
Senate, which is expected to consider soon the sweeping bill to 
rewrite the bankruptcy laws being pushed by banks and credit card 
companies. The groups maintain the bill would hurt single women and 
their children owed support payments by bankrupt fathers. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would put ``economically vulnerable women and  
children at greater risk,'' the women's groups said in the letter 
sent late last month. By expanding the legal claims against debtors 
of credit card companies, finance companies and auto lenders, they 
said, ``the bill would set up a competition for scarce resources 
between parents and children owed child support and commercial 
creditors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill awaiting Senate action could worsen the situation of  
women at a time when they already are under mounting financial 
pressure, opponents of the overhaul claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the bill cite new data from Harvard law professor  
Elizabeth Warren indicating that women have been turning to the 
shelter of bankruptcy court in greater proportion than men and 
married couples. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who complained publicly last  
year that the legislation would put credit card companies ahead of 
single mothers and children owed support, has been pushing behind 
the scenes in recent months to amend it. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has divided the Democrats, allowing a bankruptcy  
overhaul bill to pass the House in May by a veto-proof 313-108 
margin. The Clinton administration has opposed the House measure, 
sponsored by Reps. George Gekas, R-Pa., and Jim Moran, D-Va., which 
is stricter toward debtors than the Senate version. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chief author of the Senate bill,  
has been trying to work out compromises with opponents. Sen. Robert 
Torricelli, D-N.J., is co-sponsor of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley and the House measure's sponsors say the legislation  
helps women whose husbands or former husbands have filed for 
bankruptcy by giving child support and alimony payments a higher 
priority than credit card debt and other obligations. Under current 
law, some debts -- such as bankruptcy lawyers' fees -- must be paid 
before child support or alimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything possible has been done (in the bill) to protect  
child support payments,'' Grassley spokeswoman Jill Kozeny said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that includes a new provision allowing debtors who owe  
child support to erase more debts in bankruptcy proceedings than 
those who don't. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Ms. Kozeny said, when a parent who owes child  
support files for bankruptcy, ``there will be a smaller number -- 
not a larger number -- of debts that will compete with child support 
and alimony after a bankruptcy has been completed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents maintain that the legislation, by barring certain  
credit card debts from being erased in bankruptcy, would force 
single mothers and children owed support by bankrupt fathers to 
compete with credit card companies in collecting debts. 
</P>
<P>
	By sending the letters to senators, the women's groups showed  
``an understanding of how much bankruptcy is a woman's issue,'' 
Joan Entmacher, vice president of the liberal National Women's Law 
Center, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the liberal National Organization for Women and  
the faith-based Church Women United, the 30 groups signing the 
letter included the Association for Children for Enforcement of 
Support, the American Medical Women's Association, Business and 
Professional Women USA, the National Black Women's Health Project, 
the National Council of Jewish Women, the Women's Institute for 
Freedom of the Press and the YWCA.

<HEADLINE> Woman Wins Interracial Adoption Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Ending a long legal battle, the  
state has let a white woman adopt the 4-year-old black boy she has 
raised since birth, and agreed to pay her $135,000 in legal costs 
for the discrimination lawsuit she filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a settlement approved Monday, the Florida Department of  
Children and Families also apologized to Shirley Fitzgerald and 
acknowledged it made a mistake in trying to place the boy with 
black relatives whom Fitzgerald said ignored his medical needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, named Shaq (pronounced ``Shay'') was born to a  
drug-addicted woman and has asthma, epilepsy, damaged hearing and 
delayed speech development. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement says medical opinions clearly establish it is  
best for Shaq to remain with Ms. Fitzgerald and her two adopted 
daughters, the only family he has known. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Ms. Fitzgerald agreed to drop her civil rights  
lawsuit, one of the first in the nation to challenge an adoption 
decision under state and federal anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleged state officials discriminated against Ms.  
Fitzgerald because she is white and against her adopted daughters 
because they have the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement provides for supervised, three-hour visits once a  
month between Shaq and his relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very progressive agreement,'' said Ms. Fitzgerald's  
lawyer, Alan Mishael. ``A lot of time and effort went into this to 
try to give this child the best of both worlds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgerald, 63, of Palm Beach Gardens, is a longtime foster  
parent for children with medical problems, primarily the AIDS 
virus. The state placed Shaq with her just days after he was born; 
he was HIV-positive at the time but tested negative a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaq's great-aunt and great-uncle, Carolyn and Paul Simmons of  
Clewiston, are raising two of his five half-siblings as foster 
children and sought custody of him in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fitzgerald alleged that the aunt didn't give Shaq  
medications as needed and that the couple's smoking triggered his 
asthma attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Simmons said Monday she didn't know anything about the  
settlement.

<HEADLINE> Big Mac Conquers Green Monster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Mark McGwire made the Green Monster look like any  
old picket fence. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't win Monday night's Home Run Derby. And he didn't even  
dent The Wall. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because he flicked baseballs over Landsdowne Street as if  
they were golf balls. One went soaring off a light tower, about 100 
feet above the field and 60 feet over the wall's top. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to question a lot of those measurements on some of  
those balls,'' Boston's Nomar Garciaparra said. ``I don't think 
it's 480 feet to the Mass Pike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big Mac didn't actually make it to the highway, but a few balls  
seemed to soar over the turnpike toward the Citgo sign in Kenmore 
Square. Even on an off-day, he set another home run record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was having fun,'' Big Mac said. ``I love doing these things.  
Earlier in my career, when I didn't accept myself as a home-run 
hitter, I didn't like doing these things. But now I enjoy them. I 
think sometimes it's better than the game because I haven't really 
had a great All-Star game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Ken Griffey Jr. repeated as Home Run Derby champion  
Monday night, it was all anticlimactic. Fenway Park was buzzing 
about McGwire's record 13 home runs in the first round, one more 
than Cal Ripken Jr. hit in 1991 at Toronto's SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit 18 home runs at Fenway while he played for the  
Oakland Athletics, powered the NL to a 27-10 victory. But when it 
came to the individual title, he got just three in the second round 
and was knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sitting and waiting tired me out,'' he said. ``I probably  
tried a little too hard. I was more relaxed in the first round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's homers averaged 438 feet in the first round, and his  
longest shot was his finale, a 488-foot drive deep over the screen 
and into the summer night. The eight longest shots were his, all 
450 feet or longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``(You're) watching Mark hit them 500 feet when you're getting  
them over like 420, 430, and his balls are doing the postal 
service, just flying by you and dropping mail off at your house,'' 
said Griffey, who averaged 419 for his 10 homers in the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Mac's attack totaled 5,692 feet -- more than a mile -- and a  
lot more than he hit one mile up at Denver's Coors Field last July. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I didn't do so good in the home run contest,'' said  
McGwire, who hit four at Coors and apologized to the fans. ``In 
these home run contests, it's up to the pitcher. Tim got me in a 
good grove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, like Ted Williams showing left-handed hitters can flash  
power at Fenway, hit a 460-foot shot to the back of the 
center-field triangle and an opposite-field drive over The Wall and 
into the screen. Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz hit six and also 
advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just sad Mac didn't make it because I know that's why  
everybody's here to watch.'' Burnitz said, sounding apologetic. 
``Best show on Earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, despite a sore knee, won the final 3-2, winning the  
Derby for the third time since it began in 1990. He didn't seem to 
take it that seriously.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Stars To Attend WNBA Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Riding the wave of the World Cup soccer  
phenomenon, the WNBA invited Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy and Brandi 
Chastain to attend the league's inaugural All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitney Houston will sing the national anthem and supermodel  
Tyra Banks will perform at halftime with 100 New York City youth 
dancers at the game Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Other celebrities expected to join the 19,000-plus fans include  
Spike Lee, a regular at New York Knicks games, Liza Minelli and 
actress Tracy Ullman. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Liberty forward Rebecca Lobo, voted to the All-Star  
team despite a season-ending knee injury, will be cheering her 
Eastern Conference teammates from the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I may have gotten a few sympathy votes,'' said Lobo,  
who signed autographs in midtown Manhattan on Monday. ``My mom may 
have realized you can vote more than once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie sensation Chamique Holdsclaw of the Washington Mystics  
will start for the Eastern Conference along with teammate Nikki 
McCray and the Liberty's Teresa Weatherspoon and Kym Hampton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time in my life I can cheer for Chamique,''  
said Lobo, whose team has lost twice to the Mystics this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheryl Swoopes, the fan favorite with 84,632 votes, will start  
for the Western Conference. She'll join second-place vote-getter 
Cynthia Cooper and Tina Thompson of the two-time champion Houston 
Comets, Lisa Leslie of the Los Angeles Sparks and Michele Timms of 
the Phoenix Mercury. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star game might be the perfect occasion for the WNBA's  
first dunk, Hampton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The All-Star game is for spectacular stuff,'' said Hampton,  
who will guard Leslie. ``(Lisa) could dunk. I would move aside and 
let her dunk because this is for women's basketball. This is for 
people to say, `Wow.' We're here to have a great time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like most All-Star games, it could be all offense.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this is going to be up-in-your-face championship  
defense,'' Hampton said. ``The fans want to see scoring.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Cleveland's Linda Hill-MacDonald will coach the East  
All-Stars and Houston's Van Chancellor will coach the West. ... 
Lobo's replacement in the starting lineup has not been announced. 
Liberty guard Vickie Johnson was selected to fill Lobo's spot, but 
Hill-MacDonald will decide who gets the starting nod. ... WNBA 
attendance is down 2.8 percent from last season. The 12-team league 
is averaging 9,695 through 80 games, down slightly from 9,970 of 
last season. ... The game will be televised on ESPN.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Sign Goalie Kirk McLean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Rangers signed free agent goalie  
Kirk McLean to a multiyear contract on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not announced.  
</P>
<P>
	McLean, 33, was 9-10-4 with a 2.74 goals-against average in 30  
games with the Florida Panthers last season. He will back up 
regular Mike Richter and replaces Dan Cloutier, who was traded to 
Tampa Bay last month. 
</P>
<P>
	In 14 seasons in the NHL, McLean has also played for Carolina,  
Vancouver and New Jersey and has a career 3.26 goals-against 
average. He is 34-34 with a 2.84 goals against average in 68 
playoff games and backstopped Vancouver to the Western Conference 
championship in 1993-94. The Rangers beat the Canucks in seven 
games for the Stanley Cup that season. 
</P>
<P>
	McLean is the fourth high-profile free agent signed by the  
Rangers since the NHL season ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, New York reached agreement on a three-year, $24  
million contract with six-time All-Star Theo Fleury, who finished 
last season with Colorado. The Rangers also signed 33-year-old 
Valeri Kamensky, a left wing from the Avalanche, and 30-year-old 
Stephane Quintal, a defenseman, who played for Montreal.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Mostly Unchanged / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices of most Treasury securities held steady  
Tuesday as many investors stayed out of the market, deciding to 
wait for the government's upcoming release of key economic 
statistics for June. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the government's benchmark 30-year Treasury bond  
was unchanged from Monday's close as its yield remained at 5.90 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors awaited the release of June data on retail sales,  
producer prices and consumer prices, due out on Wednesday and 
Thursday. These figures are considered important indicators of 
inflation, which tends to erode the value of fixed-rate securities, 
such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader Treasury market, prices of short-term and  
intermediate securities also were unchanged, reported Bridge 
Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to  
4.69 percent while the discount fell 0.03 percentage point to 4.57 
percent. Six-month yields fell to 4.69 percent, as the discount 
fell 0.02 percentage point to 4.52 percent. One-year yields fell to 
4.95 percent as the discount fell 0.01 percent to 4.71 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.94 percent from 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 1/8 point to 119 3/8. The average yield to 
maturity was unchanged at 5.51 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indians Net 3 Runs at All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- There should be no more complaints that there were  
too many Indians in the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Cleveland fans stuffed the ballot box to elect four  
All-Star starters, the Indians proved they belonged on Tuesday 
night by scoring three of the four American League runs in a 4-1 
victory over the NL 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we represented the American League very well,'' said  
first baseman Jim Thome, who outpolled Texas' Rafael Palmeiro, who 
is hitting .355 with 22 homers and 76 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome's numbers are .283 with 14 homers and 50 RBIs.  
</P>
<P>
	Kenny Lofton, Manny Ramirez and Roberto Alomar were the other  
Indians elected by the fans to start the game, and with good 
reason. Lofton is batting .305 with an AL-leading 79 runs, Ramirez 
leads the majors with 96 RBIs and Alomar is hitting .324 with 78 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Indians have the best record in baseball, 56-31.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we were basically showing the world what Cleveland is  
all about at this point,'' Lofton said of the Indians' all-star 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton started the bottom of the first with a single. The next  
two batters, Nomar Garciaparra of Boston and Ken Griffey Jr. of 
Seattle, were retired. 
</P>
<P>
	But NL starter Curt Schilling was in trouble because the next  
batter was an Indian. With Ramirez at bat, Lofton stole second 
before his teammate walked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of used to seeing Manny come to the plate when I'm on  
base,'' Lofton said. ``It was fun to have it done at the All-Star 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thome followed Ramirez and singled in Lofton. And Ramirez scored  
on Cal Ripken's single. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kenny did his normal thing, got on base,'' Thome said. ``I got  
lucky and got a hit. It was nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Manny gets on and Thome brings me in,'' Lofton said. ``That's  
what the Cleveland Indians are or have been doing all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They did it again with two runs in the fourth that made the  
score 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome began the rally with a walk, took second when Ripken was  
hit by a pitch and scored on Palmeiro's single. Ripken came home on 
an error by third baseman Matt Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	One Indian who didn't start, shortstop Omar Vizquel, made a  
sparkling defensive play with a runner on third and two outs in the 
seventh. He killed an NL rally by fielding Vladimir Guererro's 
grounder behind second base and flipping it out of his glove to 
Jose Offerman for the force at second. 
</P>
<P>
	After the way the Indians played Tuesday night, Thome saw no  
reason to doubt that they belonged in the game, regardless of the 
voting practices of Cleveland fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are fortunate that we sell out every game,'' he said.  
``It's one of those things where you're always going to have 
speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I think every player here is very deserving, whether it be  
from the Indians or any other ballclub.''

<HEADLINE> Calm Carnoustie Still a Challenge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Fred Couples has a bad back, Scott  
Hoch a sore foot. Two-time Masters champion Ben Crenshaw and former 
U.S. Open champion Tom Kite don't think they're playing well enough 
to compete in the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	By the sound of it Monday, countless others might be wishing  
they stayed home, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnoustie Golf Links offered an amiable welcome during the  
first full day of practice for the British Open -- sunny skies and 
only a mild breeze off the Firth of Tay. No one was fooled by the 
rigors that await on what is generally regarded the toughest course 
on the British Isles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone is going to win,'' Colin Montgomerie said. ``But at  
the same time, it will be no fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Janzen, a two-time U.S. Open champion who plays his best  
under the most severe conditions, chose his words carefully when 
asked for his first impression of Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's in great shape, and that's the best thing I can  
say about it,'' he said. ``I think it's the toughest course I've 
ever played. Par would be a great score, but I think higher than 
that will win -- and that's under good conditions. I can't imagine 
what it would be like if we have tough conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Montgomerie owns the course record, a 64 during the 1995  
Scottish Open. That should be safe this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody is going to win. But at the same time, it will be no  
fun,'' said Montgomerie, who predicted scores in the 90s if the 
wind blows hard. ``We all hope and pray that it doesn't become a 
wind. If it becomes a wind, you'll see scores higher than we've 
ever, ever seen before in any British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering that John H. Taylor won the Open in 1894 with a  
72-hole score of 326, that might be a bit of a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the one consensus at Carnoustie is that it figures to be  
the toughest test of the year. The course is playing at 7,361 yards 
at a par of 71. The greens are large and firm. The fairways are 
narrow enough to make the USGA jealous. The rough is so high that 
Duval missed the green on the par-3 13th and measured a full 12 
inches from the top of the grass to the bottom of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only 6 or 7 inches was really thick stuff,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In short, Carnoustie is everything the U.S. Open wants to be.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time I think players will say the U.S. Open  
was more fair than the British Open,'' Janzen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Open was last played at Carnoustie in 1975, the year  
Tom Watson buried his reputation as a choker in the majors by 
making a birdie on the 72nd hole and winning the last 18-hole 
playoff in Open history. So much has changed since then, except for 
one thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a struggle,'' Watson said. ``If we get the  
blow they are predicting on Thursday, you might see some real tears 
out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Duval, Tiger Woods, Payne Stewart and defending champion  
Mark O'Meara were among those who prepared for the Open by playing 
links golf in Ireland, PGA champion Vijay Singh arrived at 
Carnoustie last week. 
</P>
<P>
	He played his first round on Saturday and said it was nearly  
impossible. By Monday, Singh had changed his tune, even though it 
still sounded like a dirge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each time I play, I seem to know a little bit more about the  
golf course,'' he said. ``It will be OK, I think, if you drive the 
ball in play. I think the key is to have a game plan in your mind 
and just stick to it. That way, you don't go out there guessing 
what you're trying to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singh stopped short of saying it was ``unfair,'' but clearly  
that was on the minds of several players on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it fair? It's the same for everybody,'' Stewart said. ``We  
played today in conditions that just don't exist. If we get weather 
like this, it's possible under par could win. If we get blowing 
conditions, there's no telling what wins this golf tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What about a 300?  
</P>
<P>
	``I said there's no telling,'' Stewart said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Els hit two balls off the first tee to one of the most  
generous fairways on Carnoustie, then walked over to the side and 
engaged in playful banter with Jack Newton, who lost in the 1975 
playoff and now works for an Australian television station. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Watson finished at 9-under 279, but that was when  
Carnoustie played to a par-72 and was 296 yards shorter. The wind 
only blew in the final round, when one player broke 70. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was the rough this high?'' Els said.  
</P>
<P>
	Newton shook his head.  
</P>
<P>
	``You guys had it easy,'' Els said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women Set TV Ratings Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- These American women don't just win, they set  
records -- for biggest crowds and TV ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	The final match, which drew a women's sports-record 90,185 to  
the Rose Bowl, turned out to be the most-watched soccer game in 
U.S. television history. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States' victory over China posted a 11.4 preliminary  
national rating and a 31 share, according to ABC. That was 20 
percent higher than the 1994 men's World Cup final between Italy 
and Brazil, which had a 9.5/24. 
</P>
<P>
	The success even prompted ESPN to replay the game Tuesday night  
opposite baseball's All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 11.3 million homes and 40 million viewers watched  
the American women's shootout victory. The 1994 championship game 
was seen in 8.9 million homes on ABC and another 1.6 million homes 
on Spanish-speaking Univision, a total of 10.5 million households. 
This year's game was not available on Univision. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's rating was double ABC's 5.7 rating for last year's  
men's World Cup final between Brazil and France. 
</P>
<P>
	The American men in last year's World Cup didn't come close to  
the women. The three games involving the men in the 1998 World Cup 
averaged just a 3.0 national rating, partially because of the 
team's lack of success and also due to the fact that the tournament 
was played in France instead of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Women's World Cup finale easily topped the NHL's Stanley Cup  
ratings, a 3.4 average for the three games on Fox. It was even 
higher than the 1999 NBA Finals average of 11.3/21 and just shy of 
last year's World Series average of 14.1. 
</P>
<P>
	The American women began the tournament on ABC and received a  
1.7 national rating in an opening-round victory over Denmark. That 
game was watched in 1.7 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory against Nigeria was seen in 1.4 million homes on  
ESPN, the win over Germany was watched in 1.67 million households 
and the semifinal match against Brazil was viewed in 2.9 million 
homes, making it the largest number of households to watch a 
telecast on the cable network. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a fantastic success story,'' ESPN president George  
Bodenheimer said. ``We were just pleased to be the television 
carrier, along with ABC. The tournament was a remarkable success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the United  
States tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes. 
Each cable point represents 766,000 homes on ESPN. The share is the 
percentage tuned to a program among televisions in use at the time.

<HEADLINE> Indianapolis News Closing Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The afternoon Indianapolis News will shut  
down in October, ending 130 years of publication, its publisher 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	Changing reader preferences brought about the closing of the  
newspaper, Dale A. Duncan, president and publisher of the News and 
The Indianapolis Star, said in a statement. The Oct. 1 edition will 
be the last. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the most recent figures, the average daily  
circulation for The Indianapolis News for the six-month period 
ending March 27 was 33,175, compared with 111,000 in 1989. By 
contrast, average daily circulation for the Star in the period was 
235,790 daily and 385,869 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indianapolis is a solid, healthy newspaper market, as  
indicated by the circulation of the morning Star,'' said Louis A. 
Weil III, chief executive officer of Central Newspapers Inc., which 
owns both newspapers. ``However, the eroding circulation numbers 
for the News have also made it increasingly apparent that our 
customers prefer to read the paper in the morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shutdown of the News reflects a continuing trend in daily  
newspaper publishing that favors morning papers over afternoon 
dailies. In 1998, according to the latest Editor &AMP; Publisher Year 
Book, 30 evening dailies converted to morning publication. 
</P>
<P>
	The News closing will leave 47 cities with two or more  
newspapers, according to the figures compiled by The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Newspapers also owns The Arizona Republic and several  
smaller newspapers, as well as related media and information 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The two news operations will be merged, resulting in the  
elimination of about 20 newsroom positions, which will come 
primarily through voluntary severance offers. Twelve positions in 
other departments will be eliminated and there will be reduced 
shifts in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The closing is expected to result in a one-time, pretax charge  
for Central Newspapers of about $1.25 million. By closing the News, 
Central Newspapers expects to save $3 million to $3.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Man Extradited To Face Murder Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A man accused of shooting a woman, slitting  
her throat and leaving her 2-year-old quadruplets crawling in her 
blood was extradited Tuesday from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Luis Del Toro was brought to Miami by federal agents and  
put in jail, pending a trip to Sarasota later Tuesday or Wednesday. 
James Bellush, the victim's husband, asked a House subcommittee in 
June for help in pressuring the Mexican government to hand Del Toro 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had to agree not to seek the death penalty to win  
extradition of Del Toro, 22, a U.S. citizen who had put up a 
vigorous fight against his return to Florida. Mexico does not have 
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	He is charged with murder in the 1997 death of Sheila Bellush,  
35, who had moved from Texas to Florida to start a new life. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men have been convicted for their roles in the crime, and  
authorities say they have compelling evidence against Del Toro, who 
was arrested in Mexico weeks after the killing. He was in the 
country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Rocha, who was convicted of murdering Mrs. Bellush, has  
said he is willing to testify that Mrs. Bellush's ex-husband, San 
Antonio businessman Allen Blackthorne, planned her death. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury in Texas is investigating Blackthorne's role.  
Blackthorne has denied any involvement in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	In a transcript of an interview published in the Sarasota  
Herald-Tribune, Del Toro told Mexican authorities he hit Mrs. 
Bellush twice, leaving her unconscious, but a man he knew only as 
Jorge actually killed her.

<HEADLINE> Credit Suisse Faces Losing License </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Financial Supervisory Agency has decided to  
recommend revoking the banking license of a unit of Credit Suisse 
Group AG because it allegedly tried to block an investigation of 
its handling of derivatives products, according to reports Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Credit Suisse Group in Tokyo refused to  
comment on the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese media said the FSA, which supervises financial markets,  
will seek the revocation of the license of Credit Suisse Financial 
Products, invoking Japan's banking law. 
</P>
<P>
	The FSA formally notified Japanese units of Credit Suisse of the  
findings of its investigation on Tuesday, Hideichiro Hamanaka, 
deputy head of the FSA, said at a news conference. But Hamanaka and 
other FSA officials refused to comment on the report's content. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial watchdog also turned over its report to the  
Financial Reconstruction Commission, which oversees the FSA and has 
the power to revoke the licenses of financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Suisse will have the opportunity at a hearing to respond  
to the findings, the media reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Supervisory Agency has concluded that Credit  
Suisse Financial Products attempted to obstruct an examination 
launched by the watchdog agency on Jan. 20 by destroying documents 
and shipping others off to London, the media reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FSA also believes that Credit Suisse Group violated  
regulations separating banking and securities operations, the 
reports said.

Securities Japan Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Californians Clean Up After Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOREST FALLS, Calif. (AP) -- Residents of this small hamlet in  
the San Bernardino Mountains began digging out a day after flood 
waters and landslides swept through homes, killing one woman and 
injuring five others. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1 1/2 inches of rain fell in a half hour period Sunday,  
triggering flash floods and landslides that swept boulders, mud and 
other debris through homes and cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all so quick,'' said Randy Thompson, 52, of Calimesa,  
who was barbecuing ribs with friends when sunshine suddenly turned 
to rain, then hail. ``All of a sudden, the house started trembling 
and the boulders starting coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's downpour was the latest devastation from a powerful  
flow of tropical moisture that has sent thunderheads towering over 
the Southwest for nearly a week. On Thursday, Las Vegas was 
inundated with more than 3 inches of rain, flooding homes, casinos 
and highways. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen homes in the mountain community about 70 miles northeast  
of Los Angeles were damaged or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Allison Crow, 36, was killed when debris smashed through her  
parents' home, pinning her underneath her elderly father, the San 
Bernardino County Coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors discovered the man as he whistled for help, cradling  
his two small dogs. He and his wife were among five people 
hospitalized Monday in fair to good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, bulldozers snaked a path Monday through the vacation  
community of 3,500, but some residents still couldn't drive out of 
the area, which was awash in debris that included giant pine trees, 
wreckage of automobiles and propane tanks.

<HEADLINE> Legalized Pot Said a Danger to Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Young people who smoke marijuana are far more  
likely than nonusers to move on to harder drugs, a substance abuse 
research group concludes in a report that opposes efforts to 
legalize or decriminalize nonmedical marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teen experimentation with marijuana should not be considered a  
casual rite of passage,'' said Joseph Califano, chairman and 
president of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse 
at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teens who smoke marijuana are playing a dangerous game of  
Russian roulette,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The center's report was released as a House Government Reform  
Committee held a second hearing today on pros and cons of 
decriminalizing drugs. Testifying were former Drug Enforcement 
Administration head Thomas Constantine and advocates of relaxed 
laws on marijuana use. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marijuana stands convicted as a gateway drug,'' Califano  
concluded, citing conclusions in the report that youngsters 12 to 
17 years old who smoke marijuana are 85 times more likely to use 
cocaine than those who do not. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which focuses on nonmedical use of marijuana, said  
the drug is especially dangerous for teens, impairing short-term 
memory, stunting intellectual and emotional growth and increasing 
the likelihood of unprotected sex as well as leading to other drugs 
such as cocaine or heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	It said that of 182,000 teens and children who entered treatment  
in 1996 for substance abuse, nearly half, 48 percent, were admitted 
for marijuana abuse or addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	That compared to 19 percent for alcohol and a secondary drug, 12  
percent for alcohol alone, 3 percent for smoked cocaine, 2.4 
percent for methamphetamines and 2.3 percent for heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	The report concluded that decriminalization or legalization of  
marijuana would surely increase use among teen-agers and children. 
But it also opposed mandatory sentences for possession of small 
amounts of marijuana, saying prosecutors and judges should be given 
wide discretion in order to encourage teens to stop using the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mandatory sentences are particularly insidious where teens  
convicted of possession of marijuana are concerned,'' Califano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that 70 million Americans have tried marijuana,  
making it the nation's most commonly used illegal substance. In 
1998, almost 23 percent of 12th graders said they had smoked 
marijuana within the past month, and just under one-half had tried 
marijuana during their lives.

<HEADLINE> GOP: Clinton Wants Budget Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Following an amiable meeting at the White  
House, Republican congressional leaders are saying President 
Clinton seems ready to work with them on revamping Medicare, 
cutting taxes and other budget issues. 
</P>
<P>
	But the first face-to-face budget meeting this year between the  
president and top lawmakers produced no specific agreements in the 
battle over how to spend $2.9 trillion in projected budget 
surpluses over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want cooperation, not partisanship,'' said Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., after the hour-long Cabinet Room 
session Monday night. ``His tone was the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, among Clinton's  
most outspoken foes, said ``there's no doubt'' Clinton's message 
was that he was ready to seriously tackle the issues separating the 
White House and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats alike cast the tone of the meeting  
positively, which considering the distrust many Republicans feel 
for Clinton might be a major achievement in itself. 
</P>
<P>
	But members of both parties speaking on condition of anonymity  
said there was no movement on numbers. And they said there was no 
change in the likely scenario that Clinton would veto a GOP-written 
tax cut and perhaps some spending bills before any substantive 
negotiations start, probably in September or later. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans today officially rolled out a proposed $864  
billion tax cut that would reduce income tax rates by 10 percent 
over a decade, cut capital-gains rates for individuals and 
corporations, eventually abolish estate taxes and the alternative 
minimum tax and eliminate the ``marriage penalty'' paid by millions 
of two-income couples by raising the standard deduction for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee, said the tax cut could be accomplished without 
threatening Social Security and Medicare or forcing cuts in key 
programs. He said the plan reflected GOP priorities to reduce the 
size of government. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are talking about is a defining difference between the  
Republicans and Democrats,'' said Archer, R-Texas. ``We believe the 
people can spend their money more wisely than the bureaucrats in 
Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the White House meeting was over, the dispute between the  
two sides loomed as large as ever. 
</P>
<P>
	While they generally agree the $1.9 trillion part of the surplus  
generated by Social Security should be used to reduce the national 
debt, Republicans want to use most of the remaining $1 trillion for 
tax cuts. Clinton and Democrats want to use it for Medicare, a much 
smaller $250 billion tax reduction, and defense and domestic 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're not going to do is collapse to their position if we  
think their position is wrong-headed,'' said House Minority Leader 
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. ``We think it's wrong to do a $1 trillion tax 
cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats familiar with the meeting said Clinton opened it by  
saying that prior to considering a tax cut, the two sides first 
must agree to revamp Social Security and Medicare for the 
retirement of the 76 million baby boomers, beginning in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	That is a position he has long held and one that many  
Republicans say is merely his excuse for denying use of the surplus 
for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	And he, Vice President Al Gore, Gephardt and Senate Minority  
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., all said GOP plans for about $800 
billion in tax cuts over a decade were simply too big, Democrats 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also insisted that decisions about Medicare, Social  
Security, tax cuts and other spending issues must all be linked. 
That was his response to an analogy about a dog carrying too many 
bones that Lott used to argue that the president and Congress 
consider tax cuts, spending, Medicare and other issues separately. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Republicans said Clinton flashed signs that he was  
ready to try to reach agreement on several tough budget issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Clinton  
talked about the possibility of reaching agreements on Social 
Security, Medicare, a new prescription drug benefit for the elderly 
and tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	And one Republican familiar with the meeting said he took heart  
from Clinton's talking about a final tax package including 
incentives for school construction and breaks for long-term care of 
family members and for inner cities.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sues Toyota Over Smog Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Toyota stands accused by the federal  
government of putting faulty smog-control computers on 2.2 million 
1996-1998 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit against the  
automaker's U.S. subsidiary Monday on behalf of the Environmental 
Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting under the Clean Air Act the suit in U.S. District Court  
here seeks to have the computers repaired and the company fined up 
to $58.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The suite was filed after Toyota rejected a government  
settlement offer last week that might have cost it $100 million in 
civil fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese-owned Toyota company is the first automaker that  
has refused to settle a Clean Air Act case with the government. 
Since 1995, Cadillac, Honda, Ford and seven heavy-duty diesel 
engine makers have reached multimillion-dollar Clean Air Act 
settlements with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The government always seeks up to the maximum civil penalty the  
act allows. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're asking for an appropriate penalty and notifying the  
court that the parameters are somewhere between zero and $58 
billion,'' said Joel Gross, chief of Justice's environmental 
enforcement section. The law allows the judge to take into account 
a company's economic gain from the violation, its history of 
compliance and remedies and whether a fine would allow a company to 
stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, the penalty is $25,000 per car sold before Jan.  
31, 1997, and $27,500 for each car sold after that date. The 
government did not know the exact dates on which the 1997 model 
vehicles were sold -- 857,620 of the 2.2 million total -- so the top 
penalty was between $56.4 billion and $58.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also did not specify what actions would be  
necessary to remedy the problem on existing cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates for the cost of repairing or replacing all the Toyota  
smog-control computers range up to $550 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At Toyota Motor Sales USA, the company's U.S. subsidiary in  
Torrance, Calif., Senior Vice President Jim Olson said Monday, 
``Toyota continues to be disappointed that despite our vehicles 
having the best in-use emission performance in the industry, this 
matter has not yet been resolved in a mutually agreeable manner.'' 
He argued that regulators had reinterpreted their rules after 
Toyota's equipment was approved.

<HEADLINE> Family Awarded $295M in Ford Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CERES, Calif. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. has been ordered to pay $295  
million to the family of a couple and their son who were killed in 
the rollover of a Ford Bronco. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors on Monday awarded $5 million in compensation to three  
family members and $290 million in punitive damages. A spokesman 
for the automaker said Ford would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict came three days after a Los Angeles jury awarded a  
record $4.9 billion to six people who were severely burned when 
their Chevrolet exploded in a rear-end collision. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Ford lawsuit, Juan Romo and his two surviving sisters  
claimed the automaker knew the Bronco's mostly plastic roof would 
not hold up in a rollover. 
</P>
<P>
	Romo was driving the 1978 Bronco in June 1993 when he swerved to  
avoid a van he was passing. The vehicle rolled over, killing Romo's 
mother, father and brother. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Ford executive, Tom Feeney, testified on behalf of the  
Romos, saying company officials knew the roof was virtually certain 
to fail, said plaintiffs' lawyer Laurence Drivon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford argued that the vehicle was sound and that the accident was  
Romo's fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conducted tests on the Bronco and it surpasses handily all  
of the federal motor vehicle safety standards, even though it's not 
required to do so,'' Ford spokesman Jim Cain said after the 
verdict.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Hit Wall at 67 MPH </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Michael Schumacher was traveling at 67 mph when  
his Ferrari slammed into a tire wall after its front wheels locked 
during the British Grand Prix, auto racing's governing body said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An analysis of the ``black box'' data recorder in Schumacher's  
car showed that he had been traveling at 191 mph when he started to 
brake on the first lap of Sunday's race at Silverstone, England, 
according to the International Automobile Federation (FIA). 
</P>
<P>
	The front wheels locked at 127 mph, sending the car hurtling off  
the track, on to a gravel trap and into the tire wall. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Schumacher, a two-time world champion from  
Germany, broke his is right leg in two places. He was released 
Tuesday from a hospital at Northampton, England. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been airlifted to the hospital, where surgeons inserted a  
foot-long pin in the leg to fix the fractures of his tibia and 
fibula. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher said he was lucky to be alive and that he expected to  
be out of action for two to three months. He wrote off any chance 
of winning the Formula One drivers' championship, but he added he 
was confident of racing for Ferrari again before the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	FIA said in a statement the gravel trap had performed as  
expected in slowing down Schumacher's car, but it was still 
traveling at high speed when it hit the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite much comment, there are no simple answers to the  
problem of slowing an out-of-control car,'' the statement said. 
``The relevant measures are under constant review.''

<HEADLINE> House GOP Proposes Huge Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans rolled out their $864  
billion tax relief package Tuesday, including a gradual 10 percent 
cut in income tax rates. President Clinton said the bill was far 
too big and urged the GOP to focus budget surpluses on Social 
Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and  
Means Committee, brushed off veto threats and insisted his bill 
properly ensures that all taxpayers receive a refund from the 
projected surplus they have created. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are talking about is a defining difference between the  
Republicans and Democrats,'' said Archer, R-Texas. ``We believe the 
people can spend their money more wisely than the bureaucrats in 
Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a projected $2.9 trillion over 10 years, Archer said the  
surplus is big enough to enact a huge tax cut and still reinforce 
both Social Security and Medicare to withstand retirement of the 
baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can do all three,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But in a speech in Miami, Clinton said it would be a mistake to  
divert too much for a tax cut before Social Security and Medicare 
are fixed, including a new prescription drug benefit for Medicare 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said such a large tax cut would threaten future  
spending on key programs ranging from defense to education to 
medical research and would do nothing to reduce the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I ask again the Republican leaders in Congress, for the  
sake of saving Medicare and strengthening our future, to reduce the 
size of your tax cut and join us in putting first things first,'' 
the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, echoing Clinton's concerns,  
also voiced his ``strong opposition'' to Archer's bill, making 
clear that the president would veto the measure as currently 
structured. ``If a bill encompassing these proposals were to pass 
the Congress this year, the president would veto it,'' Summers said 
in a letter to Archer on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means Committee began consideration of the bill  
Tuesday, although votes on amendments were not likely until 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said they planned to force votes in an attempt to show  
they are more concerned with Medicare and Social Security than the 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Democrats said the bill's primary purpose was to provide  
campaign material for Republicans in the 2000 races and had no 
chance of becoming law. They said they were willing to consider a 
more modest tax cut of perhaps $250 billion, if the breaks are 
targeted at the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the public will see through this as a campaign  
gimmick,'' said Rep. Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some early Republican grumbling as well. A letter to  
Archer from about 50 House conservatives complained that provisions 
to fix the ``marriage penalty'' were too meager, although the 
lawmakers did not threaten to vote against the overall bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this bill doesn't go far enough in providing relief  
to families,'' said the group, which is led by Rep. David McIntosh, 
R-Ind. ``Republicans are the party of small government, strong 
economic growth and strong families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Archer, however, said the measure reflected longstanding GOP  
goals of reducing taxes and limiting government -- and that 
upper-income people who pay the most taxes also deserve a break. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're giving it to everybody. We shouldn't be taking that  
money in the first place, because we don't need it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the plan, which would be the largest tax cut since  
President Reagan's in 1981, was released piecemeal last week. These 
previously known provisions include the 10 percent cut in all 
income tax rates over 10 years, an immediate reduction in the top 
capital gains tax rate from 20 percent to 15 percent, gradual 
elimination of estate taxes and new breaks for education and health 
care costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The finalized plan included several new items:  
</P>
<P>
	--Fixing the ``marriage penalty'' paid by millions of two-income  
couples by allowing them a standard deduction of $8,600, instead of 
$7,200 in current law. 
</P>
<P>
	--Phasing out the alternative minimum tax, which was created to  
ensure the wealthy don't escape taxes through legitimate tax moves 
but which has increasingly affected middle-class taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Prohibiting taxes on the first $400 in savings interest for a  
married couple, $200 for singles. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cutting capital gains taxes for corporations from 35 percent to  
25 percent over nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Several small business provisions, including the restoration of  
the deductibility of business meals to 80 percent from 50 percent 
and allowing health insurance premiums to be fully deductible for 
the self-employed. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans are developing a competing proposal that  
costs roughly $792 billion over 10 years. That measure attempts to 
aim benefits more at the middle class by cutting the bottom income 
tax rate from 15 percent to 14 percent and raising limits on 
individual retirement account contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate version also includes no capital gains tax cut and  
only limited reductions in estate taxes, both of which are seen by 
critics as primarily concerns of the wealthy.

<HEADLINE> Hospital Releases Kentucky Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Kentucky wide receiver Jimmy Robinson, who  
was shot twice in the left arm during a fight at an off-campus 
party, was released from the hospital Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, a senior, had been at UK Hospital since Friday night,  
when a group of people crashed a party at the University Commons 
apartment complex, and fighting broke out, followed by gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	One shot broke the humerus bone in Robinson's upper left arm and  
another fractured the base of his left thumb. He was the only 
person wounded in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson had pins inserted in his thumb during surgery Monday.  
His upper left arm has been placed in a cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have said the pins could come out within five weeks,  
while it likely will take three to four months for his broken arm 
to heal. His playing status for this season is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, of Stone Mountain, Ga., played the last two seasons  
for Kentucky after transferring from Georgia Military College in 
1997. Last season, he caught 26 passes for 285 yards and two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrest has been made in the shooting.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Contractors Implicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Contractors responsible for spotting Medicare  
fraud have themselves been implicated in wrongdoing, paying at 
least $235 million in civil and criminal penalties since 1993, 
according to a congressional report obtained Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office said the contractors that were  
assessed the penalties were charged with numerous fraudulent 
practices including improperly paying claims, destroying or 
deleting backlogged claims, failing to recoup money owed Medicare 
and manufacturing documentation to support claims payments that 
should have been rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO testimony was backed up by the Department of Health and  
Human Services inspector general's office, which concluded the 
contractors -- the first line of defense in detecting Medicare fraud 
-- had ``problems with their own integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony prepared for a House Commerce subcommittee and  
obtained by The Associated Press, GAO official Leslie G. Aronovitz 
concluded that a lack of attention to the contractors by Medicare 
officials could make the insurance program ``more vulnerable to 
fraud, waste or abuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aronovitz said six current or former contractors, hired for  
Medicare's fee-for-service program, paid the penalties. The 
contractors are responsible for paying health care providers for 
the services provided to Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Thomas Bliley, chairman of the House Commerce Committee,  
called the findings ``deeply disturbing.'' He said the contractors 
were able ``to dupe'' officials of the Health Care Financing 
Administration because the agency ``routinely gave them advance 
warning about the dates of any reviews and about the records the 
agency wanted to review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Peacock, spokesman for HCFA, which administers the huge  
Medicare program, responded that over the past two years, HCFA has 
cut the Medicare error rate in half, and, working with other 
agencies and officials, has returned $1.2 billion to the Medicare 
trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
	HCFA has taken steps to cut down on Medicare fraud and toughen  
oversight on Medicare contractors, Peacock said. He said HCFA has 
asked Congress to pass legislation that would enable Medicare to 
impose stiffer penalties and make it easier to take work away from 
contractors who fail to protect Medicare funds, but Congress has 
not done so. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said the health care agency was able to identify only  
three of 17 contractors with ``integrity problems.'' The others 
were discovered through whistleblowers and federal investigators 
familiar with the contractor practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that HCFA may have placed too much trust in its  
contractors,'' the report said, including acceptance of their 
self-certification that their systems were working. 
</P>
<P>
	George F. Grob, deputy inspector general at HHS, said in his  
prepared testimony that the contractors were ``misusing government 
funds and actively trying to conceal their actions, altering 
documents and falsifying statements that specific work was 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, contractors prepared bogus documents to falsely  
demonstrate superior performance for which Medicare rewarded them 
with bonuses and additional contracts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grob said his office's investigations resulted in nine civil  
settlements and two criminal convictions, while 21 former or 
current contractors remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a review of 12 contractors found deficiencies at all of  
them in documenting the amount of money that providers owed 
Medicare -- due to overpayments and claims that should have been 
paid by other insurers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Grob reported, electronic security was so weak at  
11 of the 12 contractors that ``we were able to penetrate the 
security systems and obtain access to sensitive Medicare data.''

<HEADLINE> International Paper's Earnings Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- International Paper reported  
better-than-expected earnings in the second quarter as the company 
benefited from higher prices for its products and signs of recovery 
in Asian economies. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's biggest paper and forest products company said  
Tuesday that excluding acquisition charges and other one-time 
items, it earned $99 million, or 24 cents a share, compared with 
earnings of $32 million, or 8 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $6 billion, compared with $5.8 billion a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
	The results topped estimates of 23 cents a share by analysts  
surveyed by First Call Corp. But the company's stock fell by 50 
cents to $53 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	During the quarter, International Paper took about $157 million  
in after-tax charges to cover costs associated with its $5.8 
billion purchase in May of Union Camp, another paper and forest 
products company. 
</P>
<P>
	Including those charges, International Paper had a net loss of  
$71 million, or 17 cents a share, in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	International Paper chief executive John Dillion said that the  
Union Camp acquisition is already contributing to the company's 
earnings. International Paper has also raised its anticipated 
savings from the merger to $425 million from $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that the company's efforts to reduce costs in  
recent years helped to boost its profits, as did the improvement in 
prices of all of its products and the beginning of a recovery in 
Asia and other world economies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking forward, market conditions are more favorable than  
we've seen in some time,'' Dillon said.

<HEADLINE> Curt Fraser To Be Thrashers' Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Curt Fraser, who led Orlando to the International  
Hockey League finals twice in the last four years, will be the 
first coach of the expansion Atlanta Thrashers, The Associated 
Press learned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the team, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Fraser had been chosen from a short list that also included 
former Buffalo coach Ted Nolan and ex-Edmonton coach Ron Low. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers called a news conference for Wednesday to announce  
their last major move before the inaugural season that begins in 
October. The team selected its players last month in expansion and 
entry drafts. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection of the 41-year-old Fraser was not a surprise.  
During his first two seasons in Orlando, the Solar Bears' general 
manager was Don Waddell, who now holds the same post with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers announced an agreement in February to use Orlando  
as their top minor-league team and will probably conduct part of 
their first training camp in central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell and Fraser produced an IHL expansion team that reached  
the Turner Cup finals in 1995-96. The Solar Bears were swept by 
Utah in the championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando returned to the finals this season after becoming the  
first team in IHL history to overcome a 3-0 deficit in a best-of-7 
series. After rallying to beat Detroit for the Eastern Conference 
title, the Solar Bears lost a seven-game series to Houston for the 
league championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser had a record of 192-111-25 in Orlando, the league's  
second-best mark during that four-year span. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the Solar Bears, Fraser spent four seasons with  
the IHL's Milwaukee Admirals -- two as an assistant, two as coach -- 
and one season as coach of the American Hockey League's Syracuse 
Crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser spent 12 seasons as an NHL player after being drafted in  
the second round by Vancouver in 1978. The left-winger scored 193 
goals and racked up 1,306 penalty minutes during a career that also 
included stints with Chicago and Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Man Dies in Yosemite Waterfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A hiker who stopped to  
soak his feet slipped on algae-covered rocks and was swept to his 
death over a 594-foot waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Siddiq Parekh, 31, of Diamond Bar was climbing Half Dome peak  
with three friends Saturday when they stopped near a foot bridge 
over the Merced River. The swift current carried him over Nevada 
Fall, and he fell onto the rocks below. 
</P>
<P>
	Parekh's friends called for help on a cellular phone. Rangers  
using a helicopter recovered his body a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Parekh was described as an experienced hiker who had made  
several trips to Yosemite. A large sign above the fall warns hikers 
of the dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sign essentially says you may die if you swim here, and it  
says it in several different languages,'' Yosemite spokesman 
Kendall Thompson said. ``But it doesn't seem to make any 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parekh is the fourth person to die at Nevada Fall in the last  
five years, park spokeswoman Christine Cowles said.

<HEADLINE> Food Stamp Eligibility To Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, seeking to encourage more  
people to move from welfare to work, will use an executive order to 
increase eligibility for food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said Tuesday night that Clinton will announce  
steps Wednesday allowing states to make it easier for working 
families to own a car and still receive food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, working families receiving federal help such as child  
care lose food stamp eligibility if the value of their car exceeds 
$4,650. Clinton's order will allow states to use more generous 
asset tests, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the president will simplify food stamp reporting  
rules that the administration says discourage recipients from going 
to work. For example, working families would be able now to report 
expected earnings every quarter instead of every month. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman will undertake a  
nationwide public education campaign to inform working families 
about food stamps, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two of five working families eligible for food stamps  
actually apply for assistance and receive it, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is scheduled to announce the measures during a speech  
Wednesday in Baltimore to the Democratic Leadership Council, the 
centrist political organization that he helped establish. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueled by the strongest economy in a generation and strict new  
work requirements and time limits, welfare rolls have dropped from 
more than 5 million families in 1994 to just 2.7 million by the end 
of last year. However, studies show that many of the families still 
have trouble paying for food and other household bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people are not getting assistance such as Medicaid, food  
stamps and child care subsidies which are available even after a 
family stops receiving case assistance, the White House said.

<HEADLINE> Techno-Etiquette Taught at Seminar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Emily Post would not be LOL (online  
shorthand for ``laughing out loud''). 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech tools such as video conferencing, voice messaging,  
cellular phones and electronic mail -- invented decades after the 
death of the doyenne of etiquette -- are making some business 
communications downright unseemly to the manners-minded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because we are losing control over a deluge of information, it  
is wreaking havoc in the corporate world,'' said Jaqueline 
Whitmore, founder of The Protocol School of Palm Beach and former 
etiquette instructor at The Breakers, a five-star resort in Palm 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	As Corporate America tries to regain its professional decorum,  
the etiquette industry is beginning to see an upswing in business. 
</P>
<P>
	A teacher of etiquette for 40 years, Dorothea Johnson of The  
Protocol School of Washington said she's recently seen a surge in 
interest from the business community, which she attributed to the 
emergence of new ways to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time there is a form of communication, you're going to get  
people who are going to abuse it, either by simply not knowing or 
not caring,'' she said. ``That's why we believe etiquette is so hot 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Convenience is supplanting courtesy, agreed Ms. Whitmore, who  
now includes a session on techno-etiquette in her business seminars 
-- along with the finer points of table manners, working a room and 
handshaking. 
</P>
<P>
	The fundamental rules of techno-etiquette, while new and  
developing along with the technology itself, are based on the same 
principles Post used when she first spelled out good manners: 
Common sense and courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
	Those considerations can be easily forgotten, Ms. Whitmore said,  
when a business meeting is taking place across miles instead of 
across the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	When conducting a video conference, ``act as if you're in the  
same room,'' Ms. Whitmore said. ``Keep body movements to a 
minimum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if the meeting is over a speaker phone, be certain everyone  
has been introduced. And by all means, ask permission before 
placing someone on the speaker, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Answering machines, voice mail and electronic mail messages are  
rife with opportunities for impropriety, Ms. Whitmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example: Outgoing messages should be short, businesslike and  
recorded in the person's own voice. They should not have religious 
or other non-business-related messages that could potentially 
offend or put off a client. And there's really no need to tell 
callers how to leave a message, Ms. Whitmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And avoid cliches like 'Have a nice day','' Ms. Whitmore said.  
``Nobody really cares.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the greatest need for refinement is in the realm of  
electronic mail. Phrases made popular in Internet chat rooms, such 
as LOL, ``laughing out loud,'' or TTYL, ``talk to you later,'' have 
no place in business correspondence, Ms. Whitmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	E-mail can make an important message seem informal. Or sarcasm  
and humor can be easily misunderstood. ``There's no tone of voice, 
no body language,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	And NEVER WRITE AN E-MAIL MESSAGE IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is the equivalent of shouting,'' Ms. Whitmore explained.  
</P>
<P>
	While the 14 students who paid $225 for her recent one-day class  
said learning about proper use of technology isn't as fun as 
practicing how to properly fork rice, they agreed there is a need 
to engender civility in modern society. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Thibaudeau, found the use of cellular phones by people on  
the street especially galling. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're talking too loud and banging into everyone,'' she said  
with disgust. 
</P>
<P>
	``These things wouldn't have happened before, but the world has  
changed,'' said her business partner, Lynda Berish of Montreal.

<HEADLINE> Cleland allows stark photographs of Vietnam war wounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CORRECTION:  This is a retransmission with corrections from AP of a story published July 6.  

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a stark display of his Vietnam War wounds,  
Sen. Max Cleland allowed a magazine photographer into his home to 
chronicle the three-hour routine he has endured each morning since 
losing both legs and an arm to a grenade explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was done to inspire other people, in very stark and very  
real terms,'' the Georgia Democrat said in an interview Monday. 
``There was nothing glossed over there, that's for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland's daily routine begins with meditation and prayer,  
followed by an exercise regimen that includes stretches, sit-ups, 
push-ups and 32 laps around his living-room, walking on his stumps 
across cushions spread over the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	In one photograph accompanying the article in the August issue  
of Esquire magazine, an unclothed Cleland is pictured using his 
good left arm to stretch his right stump across his body. Another 
picture shows him in shorts and tee-shirt walking on his stumps. 
</P>
<P>
	David Granger, Esquire's editor-in-chief, said there was no  
debate inside the magazine about using the unclothed picture of the 
senator. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to use the strongest picture we had that showed the  
reality of a man's life who happens to be a U.S. senator and also 
happens to have one arm and no legs,'' he said. ``This man is a 
miracle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland said he doesn't anticipate any political fallout in  
Georgia as a result of the article. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't done for politics,'' he said. ``It was done to  
inspire other people''

<HEADLINE> Martinez Mows Down Baseball's Best </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- With each swing and miss, the excitement built.  
</P>
<P>
	Would Pedro Martinez do it? Would he equal, maybe surpass, the  
great Carl Hubbell? 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, baseball's biggest sluggers walked back to the  
dugout, bats in their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Larkin. Mincemeat.  
</P>
<P>
	Larry Walker. Toast.  
</P>
<P>
	Sammy Sosa. Bye-bye, a called third strike freezing him like a  
statue. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout old Fenway Park, fans were buzzing. It was the first  
time the first three batters in an All-Star game had struck out. 
</P>
<P>
	In the National League dugout behind third base, all was quiet.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty obvious there's not a lot to say,'' Jeromy Burnitz  
recalled, even before the end of the American League's 4-1 victory. 
``Guys aren't coming back happy and gay when they strike out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Top of the second.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire, Mr. Home Run King, the man who conquered the Green  
Monster in Monday night's home run derby. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't do any better, missing a 1-2 pitch.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's got the best lively arm in the game of baseball,'' Red  
Sox teammate Nomar Garciaparra said. ``There's a very good chance 
he'll win 30 or more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now it came down to Matt Williams, no slouch himself with 23  
homers this season. Williams, who threatened Roger Maris' home run 
record before the 1994 strike, turned out to be the only blemish. 
And it wasn't that much of a smudge, a grounder to second that was 
misplayed for an error. 
</P>
<P>
	No problem.  
</P>
<P>
	All Martinez did was strike out Jeff Bagwell, and Ivan Rodriguez  
threw out Williams at second for an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1934 at New York's Polo Grounds, Hubbell put on a performance  
they're still talking about as the century draws to a close, 
fanning Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons and Joe 
Cronin, each and every one elected to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin (165), Walker (250), Sosa (305), McGwire (485) and  
Bagwell (249) have combined for 1,454 homers. Hubbell's victims in 
1934 finished their careers with 2,218 and before long, Martinez's 
prey may top that. 
</P>
<P>
	Was Martinez happy with the comparisons? Did he know he set a  
record? 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really happy and excited,'' said the seemingly overwhelmed  
Martinez, voted the game's Most Valuable Player. 
</P>
<P>
	Era of offense? Not with Martinez around.  
</P>
<P>
	``That was him. That's what you saw,'' Garciaparra said. ``I'm  
sure he had adrenaline going, but he loves to pitch in front of the 
crowd, just like we all like to play in front on him. Then he went 
out and did what he does best.''

<HEADLINE> Soccer Team Awaits Wheaties Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. (AP) -- The U.S. women's soccer team is  
still waiting to hear from Wheaties. 
</P>
<P>
	The cereal maker has yet to say if the championship team will be  
pictured on boxes on supermarket shelves, although the public 
support appears to be there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been inundated with calls,'' Natalie Peterson, a  
spokeswoman for General Mills Inc., said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Another spokesman, Tom Johnson, said the company is ``in awe''  
of the accomplishments of the soccer team. But Johnson said there 
are no formal discussions about using the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women's hockey team appeared on the box after winning  
the gold medal at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Star soccer player Mia Hamm is not counting on a Wheaties  
display. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people get it, and some people don't,'' she told Fox News  
Channel. ``That's OK. ... We like the sweeter cereals.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged Railway Killer Surrenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, the Mexican  
drifter suspected of killing eight people as he made his way around 
the country hopping freight trains, turned himself in Tuesday in a 
deal brokered by his sister, surrendering on a bridge between 
Mexico and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Ending a six-week manhunt, the 39-year-old Resendez-Ramirez  
walked with a brother across the bridge to El Paso, where Texas 
Ranger Drew Carter arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carter told me that he extended his hand, they shook hands,  
and he handcuffed him. He was very pleasant, not aggressive,'' said 
Bruce Casteel, commander of the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	The tattoed ex-convict -- who is charged with three murders and  
linked to five other slayings, all of them in Texas, Kentucky and 
Illinois -- was on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List and had been in 
Mexico for an undetermined amount of time, investigators said. 
Mexican police apparently had no role in the surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that it's a big relief to everybody involved,'' Carter  
said. ``The law enforcement officers that are working the case, the 
victims' families, as well, and I suspect the fugitive himself and 
his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The surrender agreement included assurances of family visits, a  
psychological evaluation and promises that Resendez-Ramirez would 
be safe in jail, Casteel said. The agreement does not shield 
Resendez-Ramirez from the death penalty, Casteel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why Resendez-Ramirez would surrender to face the death  
penalty, Casteel said: ``I've been in this business a very long 
time, and I'm struggling to answer that myself right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Victims' families also expressed relief that he was in custody.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping that everybody can start sleeping again, because  
there have been a lot of people who were not sleeping well,'' said 
the Rev. Ralph Ludwig, who took over as interim pastor at Weimar 
United Church after the Rev. Norman Sirnic and his wife, Karen, 
were killed in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The surrender ended an all-out hunt for Resendez-Ramirez, whose  
alleged crimes spread fear among those living near railroad tracks 
in the nation's midsection. All the victims were killed near 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	To law officers' embarrassment, Resendez-Ramirez slipped through  
U.S. hands and was released by border agents to Mexico on June 2 
even though he was wanted for questioning in a murder. 
Investigators believe he went on to kill four more people. 
</P>
<P>
	The case broke over the weekend, when Carter received a call  
from the suspect's sister, who lives in Albuquerque, N.M., said 
Mike Cox, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety. 
The sister said she had been in touch with Resendez-Ramirez through 
an intermediary, apparently their brother. The names of the brother 
and sister were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter and federal investigators met with the sister Sunday  
night and Monday to discuss a surrender on burglary charges related 
to one of the eight slayings, the killing of a doctor in a Houston 
suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	The sister ``has been very cooperative throughout this  
investigation,'' Cox said. ``Ranger Carter was able to develop a 
rapport with the sister and we think the rapport he developed with 
her was crucial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez was taken to the El Paso County jail and later  
flown to Houston, where he was to be arraigned. 
</P>
<P>
	At a court appearance in El Paso, a handcuffed and shackled  
Resendez-Ramirez wore dirty jeans, workboots and gold-rimmed 
glasses. He was unshaven and his hair was medium length. 
Investigators had said he is a master of disguise, sometimes 
wearing glasses, sometimes growing facial hair. 
</P>
<P>
	In court, he said nothing other than tell the magistrate he had  
no questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Resendez-Ramirez is charged with murder in Kentucky and  
Illinois, he apparently will be tried first in Texas, Casteel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of law enforcement officers, including FBI agents,  
Border Patrol agents and railroad police, had participated in the 
search. 
</P>
<P>
	Freight railroads had stepped up security, stopping and  
searching trains and watching for drifters riding boxcars. 
Hispanics had complained of getting hostile looks from people along 
the rail lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Resendez-Ramirez's alleged victims were bludgeoned to  
death, and fingerprints linked him to at least some of the crimes. 
Investigators have said they have no idea what motivated the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The trail of terror blamed on Resendez-Ramirez started with the  
Aug. 29, 1997, slaying of a 21-year-old college student in Kentucky 
who was attacked along with his girlfriend while walking along the 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez has come under suspicion in seven more  
slayings, all of them since December. The most recent killings were 
those of a 79-year-old man and his 51-year-old daughter who were 
found dead June 15 in Gorham, Ill.

<HEADLINE> NAACP, AT&AMP;T To Create Tech Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- To help bridge the ``digital divide'' -- the gap  
between white people and blacks and Hispanics in access to the 
Internet -- the NAACP and AT&AMP;T will partner to create technology 
centers in 20 cities that will provide computer training and 
Internet seminars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The technological segregation known as the digital divide must  
be narrowed,'' NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Toward that end, Mfume announced that through the program AT&AMP;T  
will provide hardware, software and on-site support for technology 
in the centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The centers will be open after the school doors close so  
parents and children can learn computer usage together,'' Mfume 
said. ``The old and the young learning together will help reduce 
that divide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T spokesman Burke Stinson said today that sites for the  
centers will include Baltimore, Dallas, Miami, New York, 
Philadelphia and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech Corp. and the National Urban League announced last  
week they will spend $350,000 to build five new Internet community 
centers in Aurora, Ill., Cleveland, Detroit, Indianapolis and 
Milwaukee. And 3Com Corp. said it will spend $1 million in donated 
equipment and training in 10 cities to help teach students to be 
computer network engineers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a Commerce Department report, ``Falling Through the  
Net,'' said the disparity on the Internet between whites and black 
and Hispanic Americans is growing. 
</P>
<P>
	The report found about 47 percent of all whites own computers,  
but fewer than half as many blacks do. About 25.5 percent of 
Hispanics own computers, but 55 percent of Asian-Americans do. 
Asian families also are most likely to have Internet access, with 
36 percent online. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also found a child in a low-income white family is  
three times as likely to have Internet access as a child in a 
comparable black family, and four times as likely as a Hispanic 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	Most troubling for government experts were indications these  
disparities can't be blamed solely on differences in income. Among 
families earning $15,000 to $35,000, for example, more than 33 
percent of whites owned computers, but only 19 percent of blacks 
did. That gap has widened nearly 62 percent since 1994 despite 
plunging computer prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume also announced a new national campaign that could involve  
lawsuits against entertainment industry giants to end the scarcity 
of black characters on television shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly formed NAACP Television &AMP; Film Industry Diversity  
Initiative will monitor how well the entertainment industry 
reflects America's multicultural base. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from calling for congressional and Federal Communications  
Commission hearings on licensing and ownership of networks, the 
campaign could initiate lawsuits and boycotts of advertisers, Mfume 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently color does not sell in the minds of some  
executives,'' Mfume said today on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' 
``We have consumer dollars and we really want to flex consumer 
power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using the dearth of minorities in upcoming fall shows as a  
touchstone, Mfume said the NAACP is studying whether or not to file 
suit against the four major networks for violating the 
Communications Act of 1934. 
</P>
<P>
	The act says the airwaves belong to the public, and Mfume argued  
there is a ``virtual whitewash'' in new programming since none of 
the 26 new shows slated for the upcoming fall season have 
minorities in featured roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This glaring omission is an outrage and a shameful display by  
network executives who are either clueless, careless or both,'' 
Mfume said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS President Leslie Moonves called the NAACP's concerns  
``relevant and extremely important.'' Moonves said in a statement 
that 11 of the network's 19 entertainment series broadcast this 
fall would have minority characters ``in a primary role.'' Network 
spokesman Chris Ender said one new show this fall, ``Now and 
Again,'' a drama, would feature a black actor, Dennis Haysbert.

<HEADLINE> Michigan Football Players Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Two Michigan football players have been  
arraigned on felony embezzlement charges for allegedly taking 
merchandise from a Kmart store. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Goodwin and Maurice Williams each were charged Monday  
in Ann Arbor with felony counts of embezzling and conspiring to 
embezzle. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin and Williams, both offensive linemen, were allowed to  
remain free on $5,000 personal recognizance bonds while the cases 
are pending, the Detroit Free Press reported in Tuesday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	They are to appear at a preliminary examination later this  
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The players are accused of being part of a six-person ring that  
allegedly took thousands of dollars worth of merchandise through a 
checkout lane at a Kmart store in Ypsilanti Township in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation continues on three additional suspects,  
including ex-Michigan football player Demitrius Smith, chief 
assistant Washtenaw County prosecutor Joe Burke told The Ann Arbor 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusations are contained in affidavits filed in 14th  
District Court by the Washtenaw County Sheriff's Department, which 
was seeking search warrants. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects would face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison  
and a $5,000 fine upon conviction.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Sign Steel Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia has agreed to limit shipments of steel  
to the United States to avoid imposition of punitive American 
tariffs, U.S. officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was signed after marathon bargaining talks in Paris.  
</P>
<P>
	If an agreement had not been reached by today, the United States  
was set to impose the penalty tariffs, which would have resulted in 
an even steeper drop in demand for Russian steel in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley was briefing reporters on  
details of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Tass news agency quoted Russian Trade Minister Mikhail  
Fradkov as saying the deal would preserve Russia's access to the 
U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement represents ``a sufficiently difficult compromise  
for both sides, but for Russia it preserves an opportunity to 
supply steel to the American market,'' Fradkov was quoted as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Fradkov told the Russian news agency that the deal was achieved  
only at the last minute following a number of concessions from the 
American side. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry and its supporters in Congress had been  
unhappy with the outline of a preliminary agreement the 
administration struck with Russia on steel back in February. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., had complained that  
the initial deal, which has now been modified with further 
negotiations, ``allows too much (Russian) steel to be imported at 
too low of a price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With political pressures rising, the administration has tried to  
show support for the U.S. steel industry. The industry has been 
hurt by a flood of cheap imports into the country following the 
global currency crisis, which sharply lowered demand for steel and 
other commodities because of the steep recessions in many Asian 
nations and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel industry has filed a number of dumping cases seeking  
to get the government to impose high tariffs to stem this tide of 
cheap foreign steel into the country. 
</P>
<P>
	High tariffs have been imposed in a case involving hot-rolled  
steel with Japan. But Russia entered into negotiations to avoid 
having the tariffs, which the industry favors because they are more 
effective at halting imports. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of Clinton administration officials argued that an  
agreement should be reached by which Russia could still ship steel 
to the United States as a way of helping that country out of its 
economic troubles. Steel is one of Russia's major industries, 
accounting for 7 percent of total economic output.

<HEADLINE> Big Mac Conquers Green Monster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Mark McGwire made the Green Monster look like any  
old picket fence. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't win Monday night's Home Run Derby. And he didn't even  
dent The Wall. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because he flicked baseballs over Landsdowne Street as if  
they were golf balls. One went soaring off a light tower, about 100 
feet above the field and 60 feet over the wall's top. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to question a lot of those measurements on some of  
those balls,'' Boston's Nomar Garciaparra said. ``I don't think 
it's 480 feet to the Mass Pike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big Mac didn't actually make it to the highway, but a few balls  
seemed to soar over the turnpike toward the Citgo sign in Kenmore 
Square. Even on an off-day, he set another home run record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was having fun,'' Big Mac said. ``I love doing these things.  
Earlier in my career, when I didn't accept myself as a home-run 
hitter, I didn't like doing these things. But now I enjoy them. I 
think sometimes it's better than the game because I haven't really 
had a great All-Star game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Ken Griffey Jr. repeated as Home Run Derby champion  
Monday night, it was all anticlimactic. Fenway Park was buzzing 
about McGwire's record 13 home runs in the first round, one more 
than Cal Ripken Jr. hit in 1991 at Toronto's SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit 18 home runs at Fenway while he played for the  
Oakland Athletics, powered the NL to a 27-10 victory. But when it 
came to the individual title, he got just three in the second round 
and was knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sitting and waiting tired me out,'' he said. ``I probably  
tried a little too hard. I was more relaxed in the first round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's homers averaged 438 feet in the first round, and his  
longest shot was his finale, a 488-foot drive deep over the screen 
and into the summer night. The eight longest shots were his, all 
450 feet or longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``(You're) watching Mark hit them 500 feet when you're getting  
them over like 420, 430, and his balls are doing the postal 
service, just flying by you and dropping mail off at your house,'' 
said Griffey, who averaged 419 for his 10 homers in the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Mac's attack totaled 5,692 feet -- more than a mile -- and a  
lot more than he hit one mile up at Denver's Coors Field last July. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I didn't do so good in the home run contest,'' said  
McGwire, who hit four at Coors and apologized to the fans. ``In 
these home run contests, it's up to the pitcher. Tim got me in a 
good grove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, like Ted Williams showing left-handed hitters can flash  
power at Fenway, hit a 460-foot shot to the back of the 
center-field triangle and an opposite-field drive over The Wall and 
into the screen. Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz hit six and also 
advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just sad Mac didn't make it because I know that's why  
everybody's here to watch.'' Burnitz said, sounding apologetic. 
``Best show on Earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, despite a sore knee, won the final 3-2, winning the  
Derby for the third time since it began in 1990. He didn't seem to 
take it that seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there is 'defending the title,' '' he said.  
``It's just going out there and having a lot fun.''

<HEADLINE>  Michael Schumacher Leaves Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTHAMPTON, England (AP) -- Michael Schumacher was released from  
hospital today, two days after breaking his right leg in two places 
in a high-speed crash in the British Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old German left Northampton General Hospital in an  
ambulance in mid-morning. Schumacher and his wife, Corinna, were 
expected to fly later today to their home in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time world champion plowed into a tire wall on the first  
lap of Sunday's British Grand Prix at Silverstone. His rear wheels 
are believed to have locked up as he attempted to round a sharp 
right-hand curve. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher was airlifted to the hospital, where surgeons  
inserted a foot-long pin in his right leg to fix the fractures of 
his tibia and fibula. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking from his hospital bed Monday, Schumacher said he was  
``lucky to be alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expected to be out of action for two to three months  
and wrote off any chances of winning the Formula One drivers' 
championship. However, he said he was confident of racing for 
Ferrari again before the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Joan Rumsey, Northampton General's nursing director, said  
Schumacher played cards and watched television with his wife Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``This morning he has been reviewed by the surgical team who are  
very pleased with his progress,'' she said. ``The movement in 
Michael's ankle and knee continues to improve. He is now requiring 
minimal pain relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeon Bill Ribbans, who carried out the operation on  
Schumacher's leg, said the driver was recovering well and was 
``very determined'' to get better. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Schumacher was ``in good spirits'' as he left the  
hospital.

<HEADLINE> Gov't To Study Biotech Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mindful of the growing controversy over  
genetically engineered crops, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman 
announced plans Tuesday to study their long-term impact on the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman stopped short of proposing that genetically altered  
food be labeled as such and said distrust of the crops, which is 
especially strong in Europe, is ``scientifically unfounded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ``with all that biotechnology has to offer, it is nothing if  
it's not accepted'' by consumers, he told a National Press Club 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to establishing regional research centers to study  
the impact of biotech products, Glickman said he would ask an 
independent panel of scientists to review the Agriculture 
Department's process for approving new seed varieties. USDA also 
will conduct an internal review to make sure its regulatory and 
product-promotion functions are kept separate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scientists who evaluate and approve biotech products for  
the market must be free of any hint of influence from trade support 
and other nonregulatory areas within USDA,'' Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA has so far approved 50 varieties of crops that have been  
engineered to be resistant to insects, herbicides or plant viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman's speech drew a mixed reaction from environmental  
groups, who fear genetically altered crops can be unhealthy and 
could harm the food chain if they escape from farms into the wild. 
</P>
<P>
	``He may as well be on Monsanto's payroll,'' said Larry Bohlen,  
director of health and environmental programs for Friends of the 
Earth, referring to one of the biggest biotech companies. ``He's 
telling the biotech industry's line and ignoring the real 
environmental alarm bells that we're hearing surrounding genetic 
engineered products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rebecca Goldburg, a scientist with the Environmental Defense  
Fund, praised Glickman for acknowledging the importance of consumer 
acceptance. ``He certainly admitted that these concerns are 
legitimate,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her group petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency on  
Tuesday to restrict the planting of corn that has been modified to 
kill a moth larva known as the European corn borer. Researchers at 
Cornell University recently discovered that pollen from the corn 
can kill the larvae of monarch butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing that finding, the European Commission said it would delay  
approval of pending requests to sell the corn variety. 
</P>
<P>
	While insisting there is no proof butterflies are actually being  
poisoned on the farm, Glickman said the research underscored ``the 
need to develop a comprehensive approach to evaluating long-term 
and secondary effects of biotech products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a study funded by the biotech industry found that  
farmers lost money on the modified corn last year because grain 
prices plummeted and borer infestations were low. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Bt-corn, which contains genes from bacteria known  
as Bacillus thuringiensis, is more expensive than conventional 
varieties. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers made an extra $72 million using the corn in 1997, but  
lost $26 million last year, according to the report by the National 
Center for Food and Agricultural Policy, a Washington-based 
research policy group. Infestation levels also appear to be low 
again this year, according to the researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``A farmer must incur the costs of the technology before knowing  
the levels of pest infestation during the growing year or the price 
that will be received for the crop at the end of the year,'' the 
study said. ``Thus, it is to be expected that wide variations in 
actual returns will occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton farmers fared better, saving $92 million last year on  
their Bt crops. Potato growers have largely declined to plant Bt 
crops because they prefer to use an insecticide that will kill more 
pests, the study said.

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Revive Parks Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Tuesday to revive a moribund  
program that has helped states purchase parkland, handing a 
symbolic victory to pro-environment lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	By 213-202, lawmakers voted to spend $30 million next year from  
the land and water conservation fund for grants to all 50 states. 
Under the program, states receiving the federal grants must provide 
an equal amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
	The language was sponsored by Reps. James McGovern, D-Mass.; Tom  
Campbell, R-Calif.; Joseph Hoeffel, D-Pa.; and Rush Holt, D-N.J. It 
was included in a $14.1 billion measure financing the Interior 
Department and cultural programs for the upcoming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The lands provision was supported 157-45 by Democrats and  
opposed 157-55 by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund has not distributed money to the states since 1994,  
said McGovern spokesman Michael Mershon. It collects $900 million 
annually from offshore oil and gas drilling leases and is designed 
to use 60 percent of the money for state grants and the rest for 
federal land acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the sponsors' victory, the bill provides less than  
one-third of the nearly $800 million President Clinton requested 
for federal and state land purchases under his so-called ``lands 
legacy'' proposal. And the amendment's fate is uncertain because 
the Senate version of the bill contains no such language. 
</P>
<P>
	The $30 million would come from cutting coal research and other  
programs in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same measure, the House rejected an effort by Rep. Tom  
Coburn, R-Okla., to cut $2 million from the Fish and Wildlife 
Service's $711 million resource management program. The 287-131 
vote marked a setback for ongoing conservative efforts to trim 
spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the Interior measure contains nearly $200 million less  
than this year's bill and nearly $1.2 billion less than Clinton has 
requested. The House planned to continue debating the bill on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also provide less than Clinton wants for land and  
water conservation, restoration of Florida's Everglades and energy 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the House approved an $8.4 billion measure financing  
construction at U.S. military bases in the United States and abroad 
for the coming year.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Stocks Fall on China Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Taiwan's main stock index tumbled 3.1 percent Tuesday on rising  
tensions between China and Taiwan after Taiwanese President Lee 
Teng-hui said Beijing should regard the island as a separate 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 259.40  
points to 8,204.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese officials have called Lee a ``liar and separatist''  
after he said in an interview with a German radio last week that 
Taiwan's relations with the mainland are ``state-to-state'' rather 
than a province within a country as China has claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	About a third of Taiwanese listed companies have investments in  
China, and their business could be hurt by tensions between the two 
sides, traders said.

<HEADLINE> McVeigh Moved to Federal Death Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- Oklahoma City bomber Tim McVeigh and 19  
other prisoners facing federal death sentences were moved Tuesday 
to a new death row outside this western Indiana city. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Penitentiary a few miles southwest of Terre Haute will  
house all men under federal death sentence, said Dan Dunne, a 
spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. The inmates were 
transferred from several different states and arrived by plane and 
bus throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just worked like clockwork,'' said Harley Lappin, warden of  
the Terre Haute facility. 
</P>
<P>
	The penitentiary contains the only federal death chamber.  
Equipped for lethal injections, it was completed in 1995 and 
contains a 50-bed death row unit. 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh was sentenced to death two years ago for the April 1995  
Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people. At the time he became 
the 14th person sentenced to die under the relatively new federal 
death penalty law. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been held under maximum security at a federal prison in  
Florence, Colo.

</P>
<P>
	MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) -- James A. Barnes Jr., a U-2 spy  
plane pilot whose photographs of Soviet missile sites in Cuba led 
to a superpower showdown, died June 6 after suffering a stroke. He 
was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes was a civilian pilot working for the CIA in October 1962  
when he took pictures of Soviet missile sites in Cuba. Another Air 
Force U-2 pilot, Maj. Richard Heyser, also took photos of missile 
sites at about the same time, and there is some debate over which 
pilot was the first to detect launching pads for missiles that 
could reach the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Photos by both pilots landed on President Kennedy's desk as  
evidence of a Soviet threat, and Kennedy warned in televised speech 
on Oct. 22, 1962 that the United States was on the brink of nuclear 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes served as an Air Force fighter pilot during the Korean  
War. He flew a mission over the Soviet Union on the same day in 
1960 that another U-2 pilot, Francis Gary Powers, was shot down and 
captured. 
</P>
<P>
	Powers was eventually tried in Moscow, forcing President  
Eisenhower to admit he had lied when he denied the U-2 program's 
existence.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Charles R. English, a Hollywood attorney  
whose clients included Jack Nicholson, Alec Baldwin, James Woods 
and rocker Tommy Lee, died Saturday due to complications from a 
brain tumor. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	English was a firm advocate of due process guarantees. As  
chairman of the American Bar Association's national standards 
committee, he was critical of new court efficiencies that he felt 
infringed on defendant's rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, he was named Outstanding Defense Attorney by the Los  
Angeles County Bar Association in 1998.

	POTOMAC, Md. (AP) -- Howard Flieger, who retired in 1976 as  
executive editor of U.S. News and World Report, died Sunday of 
cardio-respiratory failure. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Flieger began working at U.S. News in 1945 as a political  
writer. He later became managing editor of World Report, a separate 
publication. He was named international editor in 1948 after the 
two publications merged. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Denver, Flieger also worked at The Associated Press  
in Missouri and Washington. He was one of three reporters allowed 
to attend President Roosevelt's funeral in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by two sons.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Carlos D. Ramirez, the publisher of el diario/La  
Prensa who helped modernize and bring financial security to the 
city's largest and oldest daily Spanish-language newspaper, died 
Sunday of pancreatic cancer. He was 52. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his illness, Ramirez continued to come into the office  
several days a week, said his business partner, Peter Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez was hired by el diario's former owner Gannett Co. as a  
comptroller in 1981 and became publisher in 1984. The newspaper, 
founded in 1913, is believed to be the oldest Spanish-language 
daily in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, when Gannett first started shopping the newspaper  
around, Ramirez, Davidson and 15 others formed an investment group 
-- El Diario Associates -- and bought the newspaper for a reported 
$20 million to $25 million to keep it under Hispanic ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Under their ownership, Ramirez remained publisher and Davidson  
became president. The investment group, now called Latin 
Communications Group Inc., owns several Spanish-language newspapers 
and 18 radio stations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last few years, el diario has had one of the fastest  
growing circulations in the city, along with the New York Post.

who was a member of the Texas Music Hall of Fame, died Sunday. He 
was 80. 
</P>

numerous awards. He was a charter member of the Southern Gospel 
Music Association and was a dean of the SGMA School of Music for 14 
years.

	GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (AP) -- Dr. Geno Saccomanno, who devoted a  
50-year career to lung cancer research, died Saturday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Saccomanno also was credited for inventing medical instruments,  
including a brush to take cervical samples for Pap smears. 
</P>
<P>
	Saccomanno received his medical degree from St. Louis  
University. He joined the St. Mary's staff in 1948 and later that 
year established the only pathology service between Denver and Salt 
Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	During the next four decades, Saccomanno studied 17,700 uranium  
miners in the Four Corners area to help shed light on lung cancer. 
He and his research team tracked personal data, smoking habits, 
work history and medical records. 
</P>
<P>
	Saccomanno received the Energy Department's highest award for  
exceptional public service in 1993, among other lifetime 
achievement awards.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTHAMPTON, England (AP) -- Michael Schumacher was released from  
hospital today, two days after breaking his right leg in two places 
in a high-speed crash in the British Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old German left Northampton General Hospital in an  
ambulance in mid-morning. Schumacher and his wife, Corinna, were 
expected to fly later today to their home in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time world champion plowed into a tire wall on the first  
lap of Sunday's British Grand Prix at Silverstone. His rear wheels 
are believed to have locked up as he attempted to round a sharp 
right-hand curve. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher was airlifted to the hospital, where surgeons  
inserted a foot-long pin in his right leg to fix the fractures of 
his tibia and fibula. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking from his hospital bed Monday, Schumacher said he was  
``lucky to be alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expected to be out of action for two to three months  
and wrote off any chances of winning the Formula One drivers' 
championship. However, he said he was confident of racing for 
Ferrari again before the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Joan Rumsey, Northampton General's nursing director, said  
Schumacher played cards and watched television with his wife Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``This morning he has been reviewed by the surgical team who are  
very pleased with his progress,'' she said. ``The movement in 
Michael's ankle and knee continues to improve. He is now requiring 
minimal pain relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeon Bill Ribbans, who carried out the operation on  
Schumacher's leg, said the driver was recovering well and was 
``very determined'' to get better. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Schumacher was ``in good spirits'' as he left the  
hospital.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- President Jiang Zemin led an official welcoming  
ceremony Tuesday for the Chinese women's soccer team, which brought 
home a World Cup silver medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-4 loss to the United States on overtime penalty kicks in a  
politically charged match chagrined Chinese fans. But their sorrow 
has been tempered by pride that China's women made it to the finals 
and held the Americans scoreless in regular play. 
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- President Jiang Zemin led an official welcoming  
ceremony Tuesday for the Chinese women's soccer team, which brought 
home a World Cup silver medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-4 loss to the United States on overtime penalty kicks in a  
politically charged match chagrined Chinese fans. But their sorrow 
has been tempered by pride that China's women made it to the finals 
and held the Americans scoreless in regular play. 
</P>
<P>
	``You didn't disappoint the wishes of the masses,'' Jiang told  
the team during a reception at the Great Hall of the People in the 
center of Beijing. ``You showed on the playing field the 
self-reliance and self-confidence of Chinese women.''

<HEADLINE> Survey: More Feel Distant From Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than half of Americans say in a survey  
they feel distant and disconnected from government. Only those 65 
or older were inclined to feel a sense of connection. 
</P>
<P>
	And those who said they felt connected were far more likely to  
vote, contact elected officials and attend public hearings or 
meetings, said the survey, taken for the Council for Excellence in 
Government and released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll showed that six out of 10 said they felt very or fairly  
disconnected from government, while four out of 10 said they felt 
at least fairly connected. Among those age 65 or older, 56 percent 
said they felt a connection with government. 
</P>
<P>
	``The disconnect is more prevalent among younger Americans, and  
that has an important role to play in the future,'' said Patricia 
McGinnis, council president. She said the council would be looking 
for ways to increase interest among the young in schools and 
through the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Voter turnout in the 1998 congressional elections was 36  
percent, the lowest national turnout in more than 50 years. That 
has heightened worry about dropping interest in government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at how government is taught in schools,'' McGinnis said.  
It's very much historical, pretty flat, pretty one-dimensional. We 
have to be more creative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of 1,214 adults was taken by Democratic pollster  
Peter Hart and Republican pollster Robert Teeter from May 21 to 
June 1 and has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Teeter suggested the connected feeling of older Americans to  
their government comes from the kinds of experiences they had 
during formative years of the Depression and World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key is what age were you when you were politicized,'' he  
said. ``Older Americans have gone through things that were unifying 
experiences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed that just about three in 10 trust the federal  
government to do what is right just about all or most of the time, 
a drop of 9 percentage points from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds in the poll said government pursues its own agenda,  
while just a fourth say it pursues the people's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll also found that people's sense of alienation was not  
determined by income or education levels but was spread across all 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Those in the poll said that ``special interests'' and the media  
are most to blame for what's wrong with government now.

<HEADLINE> Court Berates Judge Over Abuse Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A judge who once ordered a woman's abusive  
boyfriend to take martial arts classes has been upbraided by an 
appeals court for sending a woman to jail after she made an obscene 
gesture to her accused abuser. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given what the court ruled in this case, it's fair to say  
somebody should question this judge's capacity to sit on domestic 
violence cases,'' Wendy Murphy, a Boston attorney who often 
represents abused women, said of Judge Robert Howarth. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the state Appeals Court overturned a contempt finding  
against Krista Contach, 31, nearly three years after she spent 10 
days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Howarth had dismissed Ms. Contach's claims that her boyfriend  
beat her so severely she ended up in the hospital and needed a 
court order to keep him away. 
</P>
<P>
	As Ms. Contach left the courtroom, she made an obscene gesture  
toward her boyfriend. The judge said she was in contempt of court. 
She apologized, but the judge sent her to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't even let her go home for a change of clothes. They  
just carted her away,'' said her attorney, Holly Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The Appeals Court ruled Monday that Ms. Contach's conduct didn't  
deserve Howarth's punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly it was nothing more than a short burst of temper -- an  
emotion, we add, we have excused judges (for) on various occasions 
when they have displayed it,'' Appeals Court Judge Kent Smith 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Howarth did not return calls to his chambers in Springfield  
District Court or his home in western Massachusetts on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Howarth ordered a man convicted of beating his  
girlfriend to get psychological counseling and take a martial arts 
course. James DelPilar had pleaded guilty to charges that he 
slammed the woman's head into a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Howarth said the martial arts course would teach DelPilar  
self-discipline to control his anger. Women's groups compared the 
sentence to sending a burglar to locksmith school. 
</P>
<P>
	DelPilar, 27, was brought back into court for ignoring the  
order. Howarth found him guilty of violating probation, but gave 
him another 30 days to enroll in the martial arts program. 
</P>
<P>
	DelPilar was later convicted of assault and violating a  
restraining order in an attack on the same woman. A different judge 
sentenced him to three to five years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Wis. Records Opened in Tobacco Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Three law firms that represented Wisconsin  
in its lawsuit against the tobacco industry earned $3,032 an hour 
for each of the 24,733 hours they worked, newly released documents 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general's office released the information  
yesterday in an attempt to end an open records lawsuit filed by 
three newspapers seeking to learn details on work the firms 
performed in winning the state a $5.9 billion settlement with 
cigarette makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco lawsuit was settled in November as part of a  
multistate agreement that would give Wisconsin $5.9 billion over 25 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys had resisted releasing their records, citing  
``ethical issues,'' but agreed to release them to Attorney General 
James Doyle, who then gave them to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The hundreds of pages detail how the law firms spent their time  
working on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Between Oct. 23, 1998, and Jan. 25, for example, two of the  
firms -- Whyte Hirschboeck Dudek of Milwaukee and Brennan, Steil, 
Basting &AMP; MacDougall of Janesville -- spent more than 1,820 hours 
reviewing 39,000 previously secret tobacco documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Scott, an attorney at Whyte, declined to comment, except  
to say ``I considered the final chapter when we settled the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The documents also provide details about $2 million that the law  
firms spent on the case. Robert L. Habush of the Milwaukee firm 
Habush, Habush, Davis &AMP; Rottier, frequently traveled in style, 
including limousine trips and a $7,818 chartered flight to 
Washington, D.C., that would have cost $906 if he had flown coach, 
the records said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law firms' initial contract to represent the state was on a  
contingency basis, in which they would be paid 20 percent of 
whatever the state won in court. After the out-of-court settlement, 
the tobacco companies agreed to pay them $75 million over five 
years. Based on 24,733 hours of work, that equals about $3,032 an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wisconsin State Journal of Madison, The Capital Times of  
Madison and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel sued the state in May 
for the records. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Dreps, an attorney for the newspapers, said the documents  
provided Monday lacked some details, including information on 
whether lawyers or paralegals performed certain work. He was not 
sure whether the newspapers would continue with the lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Periodicals To Get Postal Refunds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Publishers of nonprofit periodicals are  
eligible for refunds for mailings over the last seven months in 
which they were overcharged, the Postal Service's board of 
governors has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation was created when some periodicals paid a higher  
postage rate at the nonprofit rate than they would have paid at the 
regular rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service filed a proposal in April that would allow  
nonprofits to request a refund. But the agency said the effective 
date for refunds would have been April, instead of January -- the 
date the rates first took effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Federation of Nonprofits and the Advertising Mail  
Marketing Association had objected to the April refund date. The 
Postal Service's board of governors ruled on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Smith Leaves Republican Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chastising the Republican establishment for  
leaving behind its principles, presidential candidate Sen. Bob 
Smith of New Hampshire has decided to leave the party and become an 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, in a much-expected declaration Monday night, said he was  
deserting the GOP but that he may pursue the nomination of another 
party in his White House bid. He was expected to make a formal 
announcement on the Senate floor today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came into the Republican Party on principle, and I'm leaving  
on principle,'' Smith said on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' program. He 
decried leaders in his party ``who believe that electing people 
with an 'R' next to their name is more important than principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he still intends to run for president and confirmed  
that he has been speaking with other political groups, such as 
members of the U.S. Taxpayers Party, about a nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly interested,'' Smith said of the Taxpayers Party.  
But, he added, ``it would be very presumptuous to say that the 
nomination is mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Smith became the first dropout of the campaign for the  
Republican nomination, Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, weighed the fate 
of his presidential campaign after signaling over the weekend he 
was considering quitting the race. Several Republicans said an 
announcement of Kasich's plans could come as early as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the days leading up to Smith's announcement, a string of GOP  
leaders have blasted his decision. Jim Nicholson, chairman of the 
Republican National Committee, told Smith in a letter the defection 
was a ``serious mistake for you personally, with only a marginal 
political impact -- and a counterproductive one at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, New Hampshire Republican Chairman Steven Duprey  
continued the criticism, saying Smith had bailed out of the party 
because his message could not distinguish him among the field of 
GOP candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``America has never liked a sore loser,'' Duprey said on CNN's  
``Crossfire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith brushed off the attacks by the party leaders.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the establishment. They're interested in poll numbers.  
They're interested in how much money you have. They're interested 
in your name recognition,'' he said. ``They've walked away from the 
principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP presidential contender Steve Forbes, touring Iowa on Monday,  
called Smith's decision a ``wake-up call'' for the party 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that Bob Smith is abandoning the Republican Party,  
it's that the Republican establishment is in the process of 
abandoning grassroots conservatives,'' Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another GOP contender, Dan Quayle, called Smith's decision a  
loss for the GOP but added: ``We cannot cut and run and still claim 
to provide the leadership conservatives across America expect from 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A senator since 1990 and a House member for six years before  
that, Smith said he did not know how this would affect his standing 
on Senate committees. But he said he would accept the judgment of 
his colleagues.

	DETROIT (AP) -- Former Detroit Tigers and Cincinnati Reds manager  
Sparky Anderson was hospitalized today for testing, including 
checks of heart function. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, 65, lives in Thousand Oaks, Calif., but was visiting

</P>
<P>
	Anderson managed the Reds from 1970-78, winning championships in  
1975-76. He then managed the Tigers for 17 years, resigning after 
the 1995 season with a team-record 1,331 victories and a World

<HEADLINE> Columbia House Merges With CDNow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sony and Time Warner are staking out some key  
real estate in cyberspace by merging their jointly owned music 
club, Columbia House, with the major online music retailer CDNow. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Tuesday gives CDNow access to Columbia  
House's four decades of direct marketing experience and its 
millions of music customers. It also gives Sony and Time Warner, 
both of which own major music studios, an established online sales 
platform to sell CDs and, eventually, digitally downloaded music. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company has yet to receive a name or a chief executive,  
but company officials pressed the point that it will have its own 
stock. The companies hope having its own stock will enable the 
venture to ride the Internet wave on financial markets, enabling it 
to use the shares to pay for future acquisitions and to draw top 
management talent with stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony and Time Warner will each hold 37 percent of the new  
enterprise, and CDNow shareholders will own the remaining 26 
percent of the venture, which analyst Rob Martin at Friedman, 
Billings, Ramsey &AMP; Co. estimated will have a market value of more 
than $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia House will continue to operate as a membership-based  
music club, and CDNow will remain an online music retailer with a 
wider selection. Columbia House currently offers about 15,000 music 
titles, and CDNow offers more than half a million. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal provides important advantages to each player. The  
online retailer will get financial backing and cheap access to 
music put out by Sony and Time Warner, and the two media 
conglomerates gain a solid foothold in the emerging area of online 
music sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more importantly, the online retailer will be able to tap  
Columbia House's 45 years of direct marketing expertise and 
database of 16 million active music customers. CDNow currently has 
an active base of 2 million customers, but hopes to grow that 
number significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will also receive promotion and marketing  
support from Time Warner across its range of media holdings, which 
include cable TV networks, a large stable of magazines and the WB 
broadcast television network. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference announcing the deal, Gerald M. Levin,  
chairman and CEO of Time Warner, said: ``The business that we 
believe will benefit the most from the Internet revolution will be 
music .... We're on the cusp of an enormous expansion in the music 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CDNow still has a strong position as an online specialty  
retailer, but it has been leapfrogged in online music sales by 
Amazon.com, which only started selling music last year. CDNow was a 
relatively early arrival in the Internet area, setting up shop in 
1994, and it acquired a rival company N2K this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes just one day after another major media  
conglomerate, The Walt Disney Co., announced its own push into 
cyberspace with the merger of its online businesses with those of 
Infoseek to form a new company operating a portal site, Go.com. 
</P>
<P>
	While there are many differences with the music deal announced  
Tuesday, in both cases executives from the traditional media 
companies said they would place a strong emphasis on profitability, 
unlike Internet companies such as Amazon.com which have focused on 
growth at the expense of immediate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In a clear sign that Time Warner expects its online effort to  
generate profits, the company last month named its chief financial 
officer, Richard Bressler, to head up a new division focusing on 
Internet ventures, Time Warner Digital Media. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Tuesday, Bressler said he expects the new online  
music company formed with Sony and CDNow to have net profits within 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have experience making profit in this area -- P-R-O-F-I-T,  
in case anyone forgot how to spell it,'' Bressler said, pulling a 
handful of cash out of his pocket to illustrate his point. ``I 
don't think anyone else out there has a model for making money in 
this area.''	   CDNow's stock fell after the deal was announced, a move analysts 
attributed to investor uncertainty over how to value the assets of 
Columbia House. CDNow shares slumped $1.93 3/4 or 8.7 percent, to 
$20.31 1/4 on the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts were generally upbeat about the deal's contributions to  
the earnings of Time Warner and Sony. Nonetheless, Time Warner's 
shares slipped 31 1/4 cents to $75.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, 
where Sony's U.S. shares were up 56 1/4 cents at $118.06 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	In the future, having access to CDNow will provide Sony and Time  
Warner with an online vehicle for selling music via digital 
downloading, which is just in its infancy. The music industry had 
been wrangling over a format that will make pirating difficult and 
ensure that music companies and musicians get paid royalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other music companies, Seagram Co.'s Universal Music Group  
and Bertelsmann's BMG Entertainment, have also announced a joint 
initiative to build up Web sites and launch an online music store.

<HEADLINE> Report: Minority Women Lack Mentors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They often see themselves as excluded from  
circles of power and plum assignments, battling a ``concrete'' -- 
not glass -- ceiling to advancement. 
</P>
<P>
	Black, Asian-American and Hispanic women managers also say their  
companies don't do enough to help them advance or to combat racism 
in the workplace, according to a three-year study, released today, 
that is the most comprehensive of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a theme underlying the barriers that women of color  
face: a lack of access to influential others,'' said Sheila 
Wellington, president of Catalyst, a New York-based research 
organization that released the report. ``It's hard to bridge that 
gap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report, ``Women of Color in Corporate Management,'' is the  
third and final study by Catalyst into minority women's successes 
and difficulties in advancing in Corporate America. Catalyst works 
to advance women in business. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is based on surveys of 1,735 minority women, in-depth  
interviews with 300 women and a one-year study of 15 companies' 
diversity programs. 
</P>
<P>
	A first report from the study disclosed in 1997 that minority  
women make up 10 percent of the U.S. work force of 127 million, yet 
hold only 5 percent of the total 7.5 million management jobs. They 
also earn 57 cents for every dollar earned by white male managers. 
</P>
<P>
	While whites make up 86 percent of female managers, blacks make  
up just 7 percent, Hispanics 5 percent and Asian-Americans 2.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, most minority women managers are dissatisfied with  
their chances for advancement, and nearly a quarter plan to leave 
their companies, according to a second Catalyst report, issued last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The final report, issued today, explored some of the reasons why  
minority women managers believe they aren't making more progress in 
corporate top ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly half of the women surveyed by Catalyst cited the lack of  
an influential mentor, in comparison to 29 percent of white women. 
Forty percent of minority women said they lack informal 
opportunities to network with influential colleagues, while nearly 
a third said they lack high-visibility assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a third of the women surveyed said they had a mentor --  
partly because spontaneous mentoring usually occurs between similar 
people, and minority women managers have few role models to turn 
to. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, minority women's immediate bosses often can't or don't  
help them advance. Fewer than half of those surveyed said their 
manager ``provides opportunities for visibility,'' according to the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen percent said their managers are held accountable for  
advancement of women who work for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women of color tend not to have as many people at the table  
talking about them positively,'' said Susan Johnson, director of 
diversity at Pitney Bowes, a sponsor of the study. ``What's 
important is there's someone in the organization who knows who 
these women are and can speak for their abilities and potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many minority women also find fault with corporate diversity  
initiatives -- the programs and policies that aim to smooth ethnic 
and racial differences in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of those surveyed said such programs aren't  
effective in combating subtle racism, and 22 percent said their 
managers don't receive adequate training in managing a diverse 
workforce. 
</P>

	To retain and advance minority women, Catalyst recommended  
rewarding managers who promote such women; demonstrating high-level 
commitment to their advancement; and researching the needs and 
desires of such groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization cited Motorola and IBM as having successfully  
used such strategies to increase the number of minority women in 
their executive ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven of Motorola's 54 women vice presidents are minorities, up  
from 1 out of 9 in 1991. At IBM, the number of minority women 
executives rose from 1.3 percent in 1995 to 2.3 percent, or 42 out 
of 1,800, in 1998, according to Catalyst.

<HEADLINE> Electronic Airline Tickets Gain Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- After years of trying to convince  
travelers to abandon paper tickets, the airline industry has 
reached a milestone -- with about half of all travelers using 
electronic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	With little fanfare, passengers like Stan Quintana have been  
bidding farewell to their cardboard traveling companion. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintana, 29, booked an electronic ticket with US Airways for a  
recent trip to Washington because it eliminated a major worry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to be concerned about losing a ticket on the way  
to a plane,'' Quintana said as he waited at Reagan National Airport 
for his flight home to Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based bargain carrier ValuJet in 1993 was one of the  
first to embrace the simple tickletless technology, and Southwest 
and United soon followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, all major U.S. airlines offer e-tickets and their  
popularity has nearly doubled since the beginning of 1998, industry 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines, based in Chicago, said recently that 51 percent  
of the more than 7 million tickets used in May were electronic -- 
the first time ticketless passengers outnumbered those with paper 
tickets. United offers e-tickets on 95 percent of its routes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our society is one where people are looking for more and more  
convenience,'' spokesman Kurt Ebenoch said. 
</P>
<P>
	And US Airways, based in Arlington, said that the number of  
electronic tickets sold surpassed the 50 percent mark for the first 
time in late June. It offers electronic ticketing on all of its 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Other airlines report similar use of e-tickets, but no agency  
keeps precise numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Airlines Reporting Corp. in Arlington, which tracks tickets  
sold by travel agents for the major U.S. airlines, said that 40 
percent of those tickets are paperless. Spokesman Allan Muten said 
he expects that to increase to 50 percent by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers of e-tickets are higher for tickets sold directly by  
the airlines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holders of electronic tickets need to bring only their luggage,  
credit card and a photo ID to the airport. Airlines usually mail or 
fax an itinerary, and international customers are usually asked to 
carry the paper receipt. 
</P>
<P>
	Business travelers with many flights over numerous days  
especially like e-tickets because they are easy to change over the 
phone and eliminate the fumbling and frantic searching for the 
correct paper ticket. It can cost $75 to replace a lost paper 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines like e-tickets because they can save up to a couple  
of dollars per ticket by eliminating the labor costs involved with 
printing, mailing, handling and storing paper tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes 11 employees to handle a paper ticket -- which ends its  
journey in a warehouse -- from start to finish at Southwest 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paper tickets are laborious and take up a lot of space and  
time,'' said Beth Harbin, a spokeswoman for the Dallas-based 
carrier, which reports that 70 percent of its tickets are 
electronic. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines also claim that e-tickets result in faster lines  
for passengers, although those holding an e-ticket must still wait 
in line to get a boarding pass and check luggage. 
</P>
<P>
	And some say the ``e'' doesn't always mean ``easier.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ticketless passengers have more problems transferring to a  
different airline when a flight is canceled or delayed because the 
companies' computers do not always communicate with one another. 
The traveler has to first convert the e-ticket to a paper ticket 
before going to the other airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is being eliminated as airlines develop standardized  
software. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines, based in Dallas, announced last month that it  
had formed a partnership with Canadian Airlines to sell electronic 
tickets for each other. 
</P>
<P>
	American and United had planned to be able to read one-another's  
e-tickets by this summer. Now it won't happen until at least next 
year at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Muten said he anticipates rapid growth of e-tickets, especially  
from foreign carriers, as more airlines are able to log on to one 
another's electronic ticket reservation systems. 
</P>
<P>
	So, are paper tickets going the way of lavish meals and free  
movies? Many airline officials declined to say, perhaps for fear of 
frightening those not yet ready to join the e-revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more, we will head in that direction,'' Ebenoch said.

<HEADLINE> Pros, Cons of Electronic Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: I'm planning to travel a lot for business in the next few  
months and I'm wondering if I should use electronic tickets for the 
flights. What are the pros and cons? 

</P>
<P>
	A: People like electronic tickets because there's nothing to  
misplace or lose, but they aren't ideal for everyone -- at least not 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one less piece of paper to carry around,'' says Jim Glab,  
acting managing editor of Frequent Flyer magazine and a regular 
e-ticket user. ``It makes it easier, especially if you do online 
booking. You don't have to wait for the ticket to come in the mail 
and hope it gets there before you leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``Online booking and electronic ticketing really go  
hand-in-hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While ticketless travel is only just now becoming widespread,  
with some airlines reporting that they sell as many e-tickets as 
paper tickets, Glab explains that the concept isn't that novel. 
People don't need a paper ticket to check into a hotel or rent a 
car, he notes. 
</P>
<P>
	But electronic ticketing does have some drawbacks.  
</P>
<P>
	It's still not available on all international routes, and the  
airlines haven't yet coordinated their electronic ticketing 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	If you were planning to fly from New York to Chicago on United  
Airlines, then connect to a Northwest Airlines flight to continue 
on to Fargo, N.D., you can get one paper ticket written up for both 
flights and it would be priced as if you were taking the same 
airline the whole way through. Since the airlines don't share 
e-ticket technology, you'd have to buy two completely separate 
electronic tickets, and that would cost a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other times when a paper ticket is an advantage -- if  
your flight is canceled or delayed and you switch to another 
airline, you'll need to first convert your electronic ticket to 
paper before heading over to the other airline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course all this is going to change, this is just the way  
things are right now,'' Glab says. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line?  
</P>
<P>
	``The people who shouldn't use electronic tickets are people who  
have complicated itineraries, people who are traveling oversees and 
people who need that extra little bit of confidence with a piece of 
paper,'' Glab says. 
</P>
<P>
	But even they should prepare for a paperless future.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be coming in the next couple of years,'' he  
says.

<HEADLINE> Selig Won't Reinstate Pete Rose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- While Pete Rose is on the ballot for baseball's  
All-Century team, he was banned from Fenway Park for Tuesday 
night's All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, who was in Boston on Tuesday for a corporate appearance,  
wasn't invited for a pregame ceremony on the field that included 
most of the living players who are on the 100-man ballot for the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	And baseball even banned his face.  
</P>
<P>
	Pictures of 98 of the 100 were hung on banners draped around the  
grandstand of the ballpark. The only ones missing were Rose and 
Shoeless Joe Jackson, both banned from baseball for life. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Bud Selig said that, as long he's  
commissioner, Rose can pretty much forget about reinstatement to 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's anything new or if there's anything new  
that I would do to change what Bart Giamatti did,'' Selig said, 
referring to the former commissioner who kicked Rose out of 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the lifetime ban he signed with Giamatti in August  
1989, Rose is ineligible for the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose declined comment when Selig's statements were relayed  
through his business agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same old thing, business as usual,'' said agent  
Warren Greene, who was with Rose in Boston. ``Right now, I don't 
think Pete wants to start trading any barbs or make any comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose applied for reinstatement in September 1997, but Selig  
hasn't announced a decision. From his statements Tuesday, it's 
clear the only two options Selig is considering are rejection or 
never acting on the petition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without question, Pete Rose in one of the top players in the  
century,'' Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
	That said, Schmidt agreed with those who claim Rose hasn't  
reconfigured his life in the past decade. While no formal finding 
was made, Giamatti said he was convinced Rose bet on the Cincinnati 
Reds while he was managing the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly believe the ball's in Pete's hands,'' Schmidt said.  
``Pete needs to take some serious steps in his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 100 players on the ballot, 85 are in the Hall of Fame.  
The exceptions include eight active players: Barry Bonds, Roger 
Clemens, Ken Griffey Jr., Tony Gwynn, Rickey Henderson, Greg 
Maddux, Mark McGwire and Cal Ripken. Also not in the Hall are 
recent retirees Dennis Eckersley, Paul Molitor, Eddie Murray and 
Ozzie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other three are Carlton Fisk, who fell 43 votes short  
of the hall this year; Shoeless Joe Jackson, who was bypassed by 
the baseball writers and the veterans committee before the 
prohibition against banned players took effect in 1991; and Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was among eight Chicago White Sox players banned for  
throwing the 1919 World Series, and former Red Sox great Ted 
Williams has led a campaign to reinstate him. Selig said he expects 
to make a decision on Jackson's case later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Rose and Jackson were featured in a lengthy video  
presentation during the new conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither Pete Rose nor Joe Jackson's official status has  
anything to do with the selection of the All-Century team,'' Selig 
said. ``They're great players, they're entitled to be on the 
ballot. ... I want to be very precise in the way I say it: It 
doesn't in any way affect their status with major league baseball. 
However, they are two great players that have made an impact on the 
field, and they're entitled to be on the ballot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-nine of the 54 living players on the ballot attended the  
news conference, including 22 Hall of Famers, among them Hank 
Aaron, Willie Mays and Stan Musial. 
</P>
<P>
	When Kevin Costner introduced them for the ceremony on the  
field, they were joined by Steve Carlton, Carl Yastrzemski and 
Roger Clemens, who was booed by most of the sellout crowd. Clemens, 
a former Boston star, now pitches for the hated New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans can vote for two players at each infield position, two  
catchers, nine outfielders and six pitchers, and a committee can 
select up to five additional players to make up for any imbalance 
slighting the early part of the century, bringing the total to 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Much like All-Star balloting, fans can vote at ballparks and on  
the Internet. The promotion is sponsored by MasterCard 
International, which will put ballots in Sports Illustrated, TV 
Guide and Kmart stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Balloting runs through Sept. 10 and the team will be announced  
before Game 1 of the World Series. A panel selected by baseball 
will pick and All-Century starting lineup from the team.

<HEADLINE> Tergesen Does Time As `Oz' Inmate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the history of television, there are many  
pioneers. To name a few: Edward R. Murrow; Milton Berle; J. Fred 
Muggs. Each brought something new to the tube. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Lee Tergesen, in his role as Beecher on HBO's prison drama  
``Oz,'' can point with pride to his own crop of firsts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the first man ever to be branded with a swastika on  
TV,'' he begins. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a recent lunch, he then lists even more stomach-turning  
milestones of Beecher's stay at the Oswald State Correctional 
Facility (known by insiders as Oz). 
</P>
<P>
	``Five, 10 years from now,'' Tergesen breezily sums up, ``you'll  
be sitting at lunch with someone who'll be going, 'I was the first 
guy ever to be forced to dress up like a woman and sing, ``I Got It 
Bad and That Ain't Good.''' And YOU'LL say, 'Ah! No, no, no, my 
friend!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Until such a day, suffice it to say that Tobias Beecher reigns  
as a singular character among the many fiercely singular characters 
on ``Oz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had a rough go of it,'' Tergesen says with a laugh, and  
that's not about to change as the superb ``Oz'' begins its third 
riveting season Wednesday at 10 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	But along with the wide variety of, er, indignities to which  
he's been a party, Beecher stands out from his fellow jailbirds for 
another chilling reason: He might be any of us in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Oz, he was an attorney and family man safely sheltered in  
the middle class -- that is, until he happened to kill a little girl 
while driving drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	The other inmates are society's designated losers, fated for Oz  
as surely as if they'd followed a 12-step program for misfits. 
Beecher, by contrast, washed up in Cell Block 5 fresh from 
society's mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	The stricken, clerkish look he brought with him is long gone. By  
now, Beecher is untamed and mercurial, insolent and sullen. And yet 
he remains the ``ordinary'' viewer's captive surrogate. However 
depraved he may be (and more depraved all the time), Beecher 
remains too close for our comfort. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``normal'' guy cast into hell and forced to deal with the heat  
-- Tergesen says he pitched that for his character when he signed to 
do ``Oz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By then, he had starred on the USA comedy ``Weird Science,''  
done a lot of stage work and been a guest star on ``Homicide: Life 
on the Street,'' which was created by ``Oz'' mastermind Tom 
Fontana, a longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great thing about Tom is, he's willing to listen,'' says  
Tergesen, 33, ``and I think that he knew I was going to be able to 
trust him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never went to him and said, `I'm not going to do this, I  
can't do this.' If you start to limit what your character would do, 
you're limiting yourself as an actor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On ``Oz,'' Tergesen joined a large ensemble including Ernie  
Hudson, Terry Kinney, Rita Moreno, B.D. Wong and Edie Falco, who 
also co-stars in HBO's hit ``The Sopranos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But through it all, Beecher's chief foe has remained Vern  
Schillinger (J.K. Simmons), the cell block's neo-Nazi potentate 
who, in a shocking scene in the series' premiere, ``claimed'' 
Beecher by burning a swastika on his buttock. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really harkens back to the Skipper and Gilligan, doesn't  
it?'' cracks Tergesen. And for this ``Oz'' gruesome twosome, it's 
been downhill from there. 
</P>
<P>
	``My character came in terrified and defenseless, thinking the  
only way to survive was to just take it, because nothing he knew 
from the outside would work,'' Tergesen recalls. ``But eventually 
he decides, `I'd rather die than go on like this,' and he starts 
rolling the dice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beecher's hard-learned lesson: If he picked the lock of  
civilized behavior, he was free to be the person it confined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought that he was an innocent,'' says Tergesen.  
``The fact that he had the alcohol problem ... and he was a lawyer! 
You know what I mean? 
</P>
<P>
	``Being a lawyer, the guy is manipulative. He's a smart guy. He  
just has to learn to use his strengths to manipulate a different 
system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	We don't see Beecher for much of this week's episode. After all,  
he's been laid up since last season when Schillinger and his 
cohorts broke Beecher's arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
	But 45 minutes into the hour, he gains release from the prison  
hospital, returns to his cell and primes himself to inflict sweet 
comeuppance. His is a scheme so diabolical, so untraceable, that 
somewhere Alfred Hitchcock is nodding with approval. 
</P>
<P>
	So score this week's round for Beecher. But the anti-violent  
message of ``Oz'' reminds us that the match will never end. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can do whatever you want, but you better be ready to pay  
for it,'' says Tergesen. In the long run, no one, certainly not 
Beecher, ever comes out first. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stock prices closed down today as  
companies unwound cross held shares. The dollar was unchanged 
against the yen in late afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 93.09 points,  
or 0.51 percent, to end at 18,181.09. On Monday, the average closed 
up 336.45 points, or 1.88 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.14 yen in late afternoon trading,  
unchanged from late Monday in Tokyo and below its late New York 
level of 122.23 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices fell as companies sold shares  
held in other companies to cement business relations, a practice 
known as cross shareholding. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also took profits following the day earlier surge,  
traders said. The biggest declines were in high technology sectors, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, buying in internationally competitive blue chips  
continues to underpin the market amid hopes Japan's economy will 
recover, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Economic Planning Agency said today that the economy is  
improving somewhat with private consumer spending recovering and 
government support measures taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 0.42 points, or 0.03 percent to 1,483.69 points. 
The TOPIX closed up 19.71 points, or 1.35 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar stabilized against the yen  
after Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Tokyo doesn't intend to 
take radical action in currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar had risen in recent weeks as the Bank of Japan  
repeatedly intervened to weaken the yen in an attempt to help the 
nation's economy recover from its worst recession since World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and  
thus less competitive, reducing dollar denominated earnings of 
export oriented Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the Japanese government is probably comfortable  
with the current exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.64 yen, down  
from 124.10 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.6000 percent from Monday's finish of 
1.6400 percent, driving its price up to 101.74 yen from 101.39 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Credit Suisse Faces Losing License </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Financial Supervisory Agency has decided to  
recommend revoking the banking license of a unit of Credit Suisse 
Group AG because it allegedly tried to block an investigation of 
its handling of derivatives products, news reports said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Credit Suisse Group in Tokyo refused to  
comment on the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The FSA, which supervises financial markets, will seek the  
revocation of the license of Credit Suisse Financial Products, 
invoking article 27 of Japan's banking law, according to the Nihon 
Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial daily, and other papers. 
</P>
<P>
	The FSA formally notified Japanese units of Credit Suisse of the  
findings of its investigation on Tuesday, Hideichiro Hamanaka, 
deputy head of the FSA, said at a regular press conference. But 
Hamanaka and other FSA officials refused to comment on the report's 
content. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Credit Suisse Faces Losing License </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Financial Supervisory Agency has decided to  
recommend revoking the banking license of a unit of Credit Suisse 
Group AG because it allegedly tried to block an investigation of 
its handling of derivatives products, news reports said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Credit Suisse Group in Tokyo refused to  
comment on the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The FSA, which supervises financial markets, will seek the  
revocation of the license of Credit Suisse Financial Products, 
invoking article 27 of Japan's banking law, according to the Nihon 
Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial daily, and other papers. 
</P>
<P>
	The FSA formally notified Japanese units of Credit Suisse of the  
findings of its investigation on Tuesday, Hideichiro Hamanaka, 
deputy head of the FSA, said at a regular press conference. But 
Hamanaka and other FSA officials refused to comment on the report's 
content. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial watchdog also turned over its report to the  
Financial Reconstruction Commission, which oversees the FSA and has 
the power to revoke the licenses of financial institutions.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Concert Ticket Prices Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A rock 'n' roll concert is no longer a cheap  
date. 
</P>
<P>
	The average concert ticket costs $38.56, up $5 in one year and  
$13 since 1996, according to a survey by the industry trade 
publication Pollstar. 
</P>
<P>
	Dancing their way to the bank are the Rolling Stones, who  
charged an average of $109.62 per seat at the 34 shows it performed 
in the United States this year. Opera star Luciano Pavarotti 
charged a $130.77 average at four shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``The artists have really dropped the pretext that they are not  
doing it for the money,'' said Gary Bongiovanni, Pollstar editor. 
</P>
<P>
	For the hottest shows, fans don't seem to mind. Two concerts at  
New York's Madison Square Garden by Latin sensation Ricky Martin -- 
with tickets priced between $38 and $78 -- sold out in 20 minutes on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual cost to fans is usually several dollars higher than  
the ticket price, since many venues and ticket agencies add 
surcharges that weren't figured in Pollstar's average. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathy Berkman, an epidemiologist from New York City, paid $125  
apiece for two tickets to Bob Dylan and Paul Simon's upcoming show 
at Madison Square Garden. She and her husband have ticket stubs 
from a Dylan concert with the Band in 1974 for $9.50. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do wish it were more affordable,'' Berkman said on Tuesday.  
``If I were a college student now, I wouldn't be seeing Dylan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Concert tickets were undervalued for many years, judging by the  
stiff premiums that shady brokers were able to get for premium 
seats. Promoters saw how much people were willing to pay brokers, 
so they decided to charge more themselves, Bongiovanni said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ego and greed quickly became involved. When some musicians  
tested the waters with high prices, their competitors figured they 
deserved as much or more and raised their prices accordingly, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixties-era rock fans now have more money and are willing to  
spend it on their heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty years ago, if you were a rock 'n' roll star you had  
certain countercultural connections. You couldn't maintain that and 
charge a high level ticket price,'' Bongiovanni said. ``That's gone 
by the boards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three old favorites -- Neil Young, Elton John and Rod Stewart --  
were in Pollstar's top 10 list of most expensive tickets this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The cheapest average tickets among the 50 most lucrative tours  
this year were sold by the heavy metal double bill of Poison and 
Ratt, at $18.09. The Offspring charged an average of $18.45. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran concertgoer Berkman said that along with the high  
prices, concert venues do little to ensure that fans are 
comfortable, secure and enjoy the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like fans have an infinite tolerance to put up with  
this kind of abuse,'' she said. ``I wish there would be a 
boycott.''

<HEADLINE> Indictments Coming in ValuJet Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A federal grand jury investigating the 1996 crash  
of ValuJet Flight 592 has decided to indict the airline's 
maintenance contractor and some of its employees, an unprecedented 
step in an aviation accident, sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Indictments will name several individuals involved in the  
packing of the illegal cargo blamed for the crash, Justice 
Department sources told The Associated Press. The U.S. Attorney's 
Office announced an afternoon news conference ``regarding a matter 
of significant importance to the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is believed to be the first time in U.S. aviation history  
that criminal charges are filed against maintenance workers after 
an accidental airplane crash, said Mike Boyd, president of the 
Evergreen, Colo.-based Mike Boyd Group, which researches aviation 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Crash investigators found that workers for ValuJet's maintenance  
contractor, SabreTech Inc., improperly packed oxygen canisters that 
were loaded into the jetliner's cargo hold. Flames from a cargo 
fire tore through the floor of the passenger cabin, causing the 
DC-9 to plunge into the Everglades on May 11, 1996, killing all 105 
passengers and five crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board investigation spread  
the blame among SabreTech, ValuJet and the Federal Aviation 
Administration for lax oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the victims have pushed for criminal charges  
against SabreTech and ValuJet executives, complaining that too much 
time had passed without action. Federal and state investigators 
have been looking into the cause of the crash, which led to tougher 
requirements for transporting hazardous cargo aboard commercial 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of those expected to be indicted were the mechanics who  
removed the oxygen generators from two planes SabreTech was 
overhauling for ValuJet. They were expected to be charged with 
falsifying documents for signing work cards that said they had 
installed plastic safety caps on the generators, although no caps 
had been installed. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at SabreTech said Monday they were aware charges were  
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this happens it will not only be unfair and inappropriate  
but a sad day for civil aviation,'' said Kenneth Quinn, an attorney 
representing SabreTech. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxygen generators, about the size of a Thermos bottle, normally  
are installed in jetliners in compartments above passengers' heads. 
The generators contain chemicals that, when mixed in emergencies, 
produce about 15 minutes' worth of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	The chemical mix that takes place once an oxygen generator is  
activated also produces heat that can reach 500 degrees. Safety 
caps are used to keep the generators from activating when they are 
being transported as cargo. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA has proposed a record fine of $2.25 million against  
SabreTech for improperly handling the canisters. The company is 
challenging the fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA grounded Atlanta-based ValuJet after the crash. The  
airline later merged with the Orlando-based discount carrier 
AirTran and now flies under the name AirTran. 
</P>
<P>
	SabreTech's maintenance operation, which was owned by St.  
Louis-based Sabreliner, has since been sold. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Canseco May Be Facing Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Jose Canseco feels betrayed, again.  
</P>
<P>
	A week after saying he had overcome so many injuries that he  
didn't think there was anything else he could hurt on his body, the 
Tampa Bay Devil Rays slugger is headed back to the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors expect him to make a full recovery from back surgery,  
but he conceded retirement might be an option he has to consider if 
he doesn't come back and swing the bat the way he's accustomed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it has been a lot of surgeries and a lot of pain ...  
I'm not taking it for granted,'' he said Monday of the prospect of 
returning and continuing to produce like he did the first half of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting a career-high 46 homers for the Toronto Blue Jays  
last year, Canseco was on pace to post even better numbers in 1999 
when stiffness in his lower back was replaced Sunday by 
excruciating pain that prompted surgery to repair a herniated disc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you have to have a little bit of luck, and I don't  
have it,'' the Devil Rays designated hitter said from his hospital 
bed in Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just incredible,'' Canseco added. ``I compare it to a  
high-performance car. One little spark plug can be loose, and the 
whole car won't run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, who leads the AL with 31 homers and is hitting .276  
with 69 RBIs, was selected as the league's starting DH for 
tonight's All-Star game in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	He apologized to fans who voted for him and who were also hoping  
to see him in Monday night's home run derby competition at Fenway 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``This to me is a nightmare with the year I'm having, the  
consistency I've had ... The timing couldn't be worse,'' he added. 
``I was given all the ability in the world. Not to be able to use 
it is one of the worst things that can happen to a human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco and the Devil Rays are not sure what caused the intense  
pain that left the 35-year-old no alternative than to undergo 
surgery similar to the operation he had for a ruptured disc on his 
left side in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Although doctors said he could have opted for non-surgical care,  
Canseco said he was in such discomfort that he was almost certain 
that he had the same type of injury that had forced him to undergo 
surgery the last time. 
</P>
<P>
	The only difference was, this time, the bad disc was on his  
right side. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just happens. There aren't too many indications,'' said  
Canseco, who left in the eighth inning of Friday night's game 
against Florida in Miami because of stiffness in his back. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco sat out Saturday night's game, then had an MRI Sunday  
that revealed a severely compressed nerve was causing weakness in 
the toes of his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco said surgery eliminated the pain, but it will be several  
weeks before the scar tissue from the incision in his back heals 
enough for him to start rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said he will be sidelined up to six weeks. Canseco  
recalled it took about two months to return from back surgery three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, who signed a one-year contract with the Devil Rays last  
winter with a base salary of $2 million, already has earned 
$250,000 in bonuses for making 300 plate appearances ($200,000) and 
the All-Star team ($50,000). He's not likely to make the 500 plate 
appearances that would guarantee him a $3 million contract for next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if his mention of possible retirement was out of  
frustration or if it was a serious consideration, Canseco 
emphasized that he wants to continue to play -- preferably in Tampa 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely frustration. But you have to consider it if  
you can't come back and play the way you want to. ... I don't want 
to hurt a lineup,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My future is unsure right now. And it's not because of a lack  
of ability, but a lack of health. There are not a lot of guys in my 
shoes who can say they have the ability to hit 50 or 60 home runs, 
but won't get a chance to do it because they can't stay healthy. I 
don't know what I could do if I stayed healthy all year round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays would like to give him a chance to see.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everything he did for us the first half of the season would  
lead to believe that if everything goes well with the surgery and 
he handles the rehab the way it should be handled that he'll be 
with this club next year,'' general manager Chuck LaMar said.

<HEADLINE> Vet Found Guilty in Cruelty Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLD BRIDGE, N.J. (AP) -- A veterinarian accused of choking,  
throwing and punching pets under his care has been convicted of 
cruelty to animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal Judge Emery Toth convicted Howard Baker on Monday and  
ordered him to pay $3,500, attend anger management classes and 
perform community service. 
</P>
<P>
	The case centered on a video secretly made by an animal rights  
activist who had been a Baker assistant. The tape showed the doctor 
striking a Dalmatian twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker was also accused, among other things, of grasping a cat  
around the neck and flailing it to its death. 
</P>
<P>
	He denied the cruelty allegations, saying he gave only light  
slaps or taps to pets and grabbed cats by the scruff of the neck to 
calm them. He said the Dalmatian had tried to bite him. 
</P>
<P>
	The former assistant ``was one witness in the face of four  
others who were there and said it didn't happen,'' defense attorney 
Michael Rosenbaum said. ``That's round one. We have a bunch more 
rounds to go.''

<HEADLINE> Uruguay 5, Chile 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASUNCION, Paraguay, (AP) -- Chile blew two penalty kicks, one in  
regulation and another in the tiebreaker, and Uruguay qualified for 
the final of the Copa America soccer tournament with a 5-3 victory 
in the penalty-kick shootout after a 1-1 tie Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing with the assurance of a veteran, Uruguay's 20-year-old  
goalie, Fabian Cabrini, dived to his left to knock away the kick by 
Mauricio Aros in the shootout. Chile didn't miss again, but Uruguay 
didn't miss at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was virtually a repeat of Uruguay's 1-1 defeat of  
Paraguay in the quarterfinals, when Carini also made a big save in 
the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Uruguay, which brought a junior team to the Copa America, faces  
the winner of the Brazil-Mexico matchup in the final. Again 
Uruguary will be the underdog, but its youngsters already have 
shown they can play with the best. 
</P>
<P>
	Uruguay took a 1-0 lead after a corner kick in the 22nd minute.  
Walter Coelho fired the ball to the far post and Lembo caught the 
defense flatfooted to head it in. 
</P>
<P>
	Paraguayan referee Ubaldo Aquino awarded a penalty that went for  
naught when Chile's Salas bounced a shot off the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
	Chile tied it 1-1 in the 60th minute on Zamorano's soaring  
header.

<HEADLINE> Longtime Naval Academy Trainer Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Leon ``Red'' Romo, a legendary athletic  
trainer who spent 41 years at the Naval Academy and cared for such 
midshipmen athletes as Roger Staubach and David Robinson, has died 
at age 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Romo died Sunday at Anne Arundel Medical Center after suffering  
a stroke on May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy's athletic trainer from 1956 until his retirement in 1997,  
Romo was popular with both athletes and top brass at the academy, 
where he was known for his keen wit and sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Los Angeles, Romo was a running back on the Louisiana  
State University football team in the 1940s, where he became 
interested in athletic training. After receiving his physical 
education degree from LSU in 1945, he became an assistant trainer 
at Columbia University and then, briefly, head trainer at Colgate 
University. He returned to Columbia in 1949, serving as head 
trainer for six years. He also coached New York City's Power 
Memorial High School football team in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	Romo joined the Naval Academy staff in 1956.  
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by two children, Rusty Romo and Brynne Lincoln of  
Annapolis; two grandchildren and two sisters, Barbara Levitt of 
West Orange, N.J., and Dolores Romo of Montclair, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Romo will be buried Thursday at Hillcrest Cemetery.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. TV Station Rescinds Ad Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- How much is a favorable news story worth to  
business executives? Approximately $15,000, one Tennessee 
television station figured. 
</P>
<P>
	A Fox affiliate in Chattanooga, Tenn., offered to produce and  
air three ``positive'' stories about local companies on its news 
programs in exchange for a $15,000 payment. 
</P>
<P>
	The affiliate, WDSI Fox-61, begin broadcasting news shows this  
year for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	An executive who oversees the station said Monday a rogue  
salesperson at WDSI made a mistake and the offers were quickly 
rescinded before any were accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's out of ignorance that this happened, because they don't  
understand the ethics of journalism,'' said David Janecek, vice 
president for news at Pegasus Broadcast Television, a 
Pennsylvania-based company that owns Fox-61. 
</P>
<P>
	A Fox spokesman in New York said the network had no prior  
knowledge of the offer and had nothing to do with the conduct of 
its affiliate stations. 
</P>
<P>
	A one-page sales circular distributed by the station said that  
Fox-61 News was producing a series of news segments highlighting 
prominent businesses in the Chattanooga area. ``We want your 
company highlighted!'' said the sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fox-61 News is the most credible programming for the image of  
your company,'' the solicitation continues. ``When an organization 
is involved with positive news coverage, that organization is 
looked upon extremely favorable (sic) in the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $15,000 fee entitled companies to news segments that would  
be repeated during the morning, midday and evening news programs, 
along with 18 promotional spots drawing attention to the stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Waterhouse, a public relations executive who represents  
businesses in the Chattanooga area, received the solicitation and 
was ``shocked it was so blatant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think there needs to be an extremely clear division  
between advertising and news,'' Waterhouse said. ``The public needs 
to understand that you can't buy favorable news stories about your 
clients or anybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erlanger Health System, which owns clinics and a hospital in  
Chattanooga, also received the offer. ``Pretty much everyone agreed 
that it was not only a high price, it was somebody putting a price 
on news,'' spokeswoman Carolyn Peak said. 
</P>
<P>
	The station's general manager, Jim Wright, referred all calls to  
Janecek. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pegasus executive said the salesperson who devised and  
distributed the offer acted against policy and without permission. 
He wouldn't name the person involved or discuss what action the 
company might take. 
</P>
<P>
	Waterhouse suggested, however, that more than one person might  
have been involved: He said the offer was dropped off at his office 
by two people, including the Fox-61 sales manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how this would affect the station's credibility as a news  
organization, Janecek said, ``It's not going to help.''

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Ends Over $20 a Brrel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures prices finished above $20 a barrel Tuesday on  
the New York Mercantile Exchange for the first time since 1997 as 
investors bet inventories will continue to tighten. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, silver and copper futures retreated sharply.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude rose to its highest levels since Nov. 19, 1997 as a  
refinery outage on the West Coast fueled new concern about 
tightening inventories of crude, gasoline and distillates. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron shut its 65,000 barrel a day gas-making unit at its  
Richmond, Calif., refinery over the weekend due to a mechanical 
problem and was forced to heavily buy gasoline on the spot market 
to make up for an expected shortfall, market participants said. 
</P>
<P>
	The news pushed crude past $20 a barrel, where it had stubbornly  
hovered for weeks, as investors squared positions in advance of 
weekly inventory data, which was expected to show another decline 
in crude stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude inventories have been on the retreat, according to the  
American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Energy Department, as 
world oil producers show unusual cooperation in keeping excess 
supplies off the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Such action in the past month has helped erase a year-over-year  
surplus and spurred talk that supplies of gasoline and heating oil 
may become critically tight later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Petroleum Institute reported after the close of  
Tuesday's trading, that the nation's crude oil inventories fell 
from 327.22 million barrels to 324.63 million in the week ended 
July 9, while gasoline supplies slipped to 212.79 million barrels, 
from 214.69 a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for August delivery rose 24 cents to $20.15 a barrel;  
August heating oil rose .57 cent to 51.72 cents a gallon; August 
unleaded gasoline rose .18 cent to 59.77 cents a gallon; August 
natural gas rose .32 cent to $2.176 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
as warehouse inventories rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants were taken unawares by a steep rise in  
stocks moving into warehouses owned by the London Metal Exchange. 
Copper has been on the rise in recent weeks as suppliers reduce 
production in the face of a supply glut. 
</P>
<P>
	But the increasing prices apparently attracted a wave of  
selling. The London Metal Exchange reported stocks rose 8,775 
metric tons to 766,100 metric tons. The report threw cold water on 
a heated market, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still going to have a supply surplus this year,'' said  
metals analyst David Meger at Alaron Trading. ``The situation will 
get better down the road, but it doesn't fix the immediate 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	September high-grade copper fell 1.7 cents to 76.20 cents a  
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver futures also tumbled on the New York Merc as the cost of  
borrowing the metal fell, a sign that heavy recent demand from both 
physical users and investors may be waning. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver also had risen on the copper production cuts because  
silver often is produced as a byproduct of copper mining. 
</P>
<P>
	September silver fell 10 cents to $5.16 an ounce.

<HEADLINE> Michigan Suing Robin Leach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan has joined 13 other states in a  
suit against entertainer Robin Leach and two Florida companies, 
claiming they misled consumers about tropical vacation packages. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan Attorney General Jennifer Granholm said Tuesday that  
Ramada Plaza Resorts and National Travel Services of Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla., mailed ``official-looking'' documents telling 
consumers they had won a Florida vacation and a cruise to the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Accommodations were described as ``world class,'' Granholm said.  
Leach, best known for the TV series ``Lifestyles of the Rich and 
Famous,'' endorsed the travel package. 
</P>
<P>
	Granholm said consumers actually won a chance to pay $1,000 for  
a 7-day trip to Florida. The cruise to the Bahamas consisted of a 
ride on a car ferry, she said, and ``Las Vegas-style'' gambling was 
a game of bingo. 
</P>
<P>
	Granholm said the companies also failed to tell participants  
that they would have to sit through a lengthy presentation on 
timeshares. ``Having to sit through a sales presentation and pay 
inflated prices for a `free' vacation is nothing more than a 
scam,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Epstein, an attorney representing Leach and the two  
companies, did not return a message Tuesday. A spokesperson for 
Leach has said that the entertainer cut his ties with the Florida 
companies last year.

<HEADLINE> House Condemns Child Sex Abuse Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Monday unanimously condemned a  
1998 article in an American Psychological Association journal that 
concluded that some victims of child sexual abuse suffered little 
long-term consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 355-0 to denounce the study in the Psychological  
Bulletin, one of the APA's 37 journals, that Rep. Matt Salmon, 
R-Ariz., sponsor of the resolution, called the ``emancipation 
proclamation of pedophiles.'' Thirteen voted ``present.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The APA, which represents 159,000 clinicians, researchers and  
educators, earlier this month put out a statement responding to the 
furor caused by the article, saying it strongly endorses the 
position that ``the sexual abuse of children is a criminal act that 
is reprehensible in any context.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It said that for the first time in its 107-year history of  
publishing it has sought independent expert evaluation of the 
scientific quality of the article. It added that ``we recognize 
that we must take into account not only the scientific merit of 
articles but also their implication for public policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The July 1998 article analyzed the findings of 59 earlier  
studies involving college students who had been sexually abused 
before the age of 18, concluding that not all victims viewed their 
experiences negatively and that lasting negative effects were less 
serious in many cases than commonly believed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who excuse this evil conduct, particularly those in  
positions of influence, are also pretty low on the food chain and 
deserve the harshest possible condemnation,'' Salmon said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also praised the APA for its strong stand against child  
sexual abuse and noted that the resolution had been revised to 
reflect the APA position. 
</P>
<P>
	The article became an issue in Congress in recent weeks after  
radio therapist Laura Schlessinger highlighted it on her show and 
Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative groups such as the Family Research Council and the  
Christian Coalition have also spoken out against it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is any truth to the saying that it takes a village,  
then every person in the village ought to value children,'' said 
Family Research Council spokesperson Janet Parshall. ``If we don't 
decry this from one end of the Congress to the other something is 
seriously wrong with this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is House Con. Res. 107.

<HEADLINE> British Man Wins Top Dishonor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Bored one night, David Chuter typed up the  
opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels in ``a moment 
of total insanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All that bad work paid off when the self-described ``obscure  
bureaucrat'' from London learned Tuesday that he had captured this 
year's top award for horrible writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thought I had was `Oh good!''' said Chuter, 47, who  
has a doctorate in English literature. ``The second thought I had 
was `Oh no!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Chuter, the first non-American to win the top dishonor, said  
winning the 18th annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest has a down 
side: ``I will now be deemed totally unreliable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contest, sponsored by San Jose State University's English  
department, challenges entrants to write the worst opening sentence 
to an imaginary novel. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuter's entry reads: ``Through the gathering gloom of a  
late-October afternoon, along the greasy, cracked paving-stones 
slick from the sputum of the sky, Stanley Ruddlethorp wearily 
trudged up the hill from the cemetery where his wife, sister, 
brother, and three children were all buried, and forced open the 
door of his decaying house, blissfully unaware of the catastrophe 
that was soon to devastate his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chuter, a civil servant, said his inspiration came from the  
hardscrabble stories from England's North Country, a fading 
industrial region, and John Steinbeck's ``The Grapes of Wrath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The interesting thing about parody is how far you can take it  
before you fall off the edge,'' Chuter said in a telephone 
interview from London. ``You begin with a certain theme like gloom 
and doom and death and things and see how long you can continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contest is named after the prolific 19th century English  
novelist Edward George Earl Bulwer-Lytton, whose novel ``Paul 
Clifford'' began with the immortal words, ``It was a dark and 
stormy night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's contest attracted thousands of entries from across  
the nation and 11 other countries including Australia, South Africa 
and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	Other winners were announced in categories including science  
fiction, romance and fantasy. In keeping with the stature and 
dignity of the competition, winners receive the traditional award: 
zilch. 
</P>
<P>
	David Hirsch of Seattle won in the Purple Prose category with  
this opening line: ``Rain -- violent torrents of it, rain like fetid 
water from a God-sized pot of pasta strained through a sky-wide 
colander, rain as Noah knew it, flaying the shuddering trees, 
whipping the whitecapped waters, violating the sodden firmament, 
purging purity and filth alike from the land, rain without mercy, 
without surcease, incontinent rain, turning to intermittent showers 
overnight with partial clearing Tuesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Wendy Lawton of Hilmar, Calif., captured the children's  
literature prize with: ``The greedy schoolbus crept through the 
streets devouring clumps of children until its belly groaned with 
surfeit, then lumbered back to the schoolhouse where it obligingly 
regurgitated its meal onto the grounds.''

<HEADLINE> PR Chief Leaves Bush Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- David Beckwith has resigned as  
communications manager for Texas Gov. George W. Bush's presidential 
campaign over Bush said was ``stylistic differences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A brief statement Tuesday from Bush's campaign headquarters said  
Beckwith was returning to Washington, D.C., but gave no other 
reason for his departure. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bush, upon his arrival Tuesday night in Washington,  
said Beckwith had ``resigned ... over stylistic differences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good friend of mine,'' Bush said of Beckwith. ``It just  
didn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other aides commented on the nature of the split.  
</P>
<P>
	``You do things one way in Texas, and another way in the  
beltway,'' said Eric Woolson, spokesman for Bush's Iowa campaign. 
``There were differences in style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beckwith was part of a three-member image team on Bush's  
campaign staff exploring the GOP presidential nomination. No 
replacement was immediately named. Mindy Tucker is the campaign's 
press secretary; Karen Hughes carries the title of communications 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm convinced George W. Bush will be our president and a great  
one,'' Beckwith said in a news release. ``I'm proud to have been 
aboard for his campaign launch. ...I look forward to helping in any 
way I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Bush's staff 10 weeks ago, Beckwith had been an  
aide to former Vice President Dan Quayle and also had worked for 
the campaign of Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas.

<HEADLINE> Indianapolis News Closing Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis News will cease publication  
with its Oct. 1 edition, joining the growing number of newspapers 
ignored by readers who have little time or inclination to read an 
afternoon daily. 
</P>
<P>
	The 130-year-old newspaper, the oldest in Indianapolis and one  
that billed itself as ``the great Hoosier daily,'' had seen its 
circulation dwindle to 33,175 for the six-month period ending March 
27, compared to 111,000 a decade ago, president and publisher Dale 
A. Duncan said Tuesday in announcing the closing. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan and executive editor Frank Caperton cited declining  
numbers of stay-at-home moms and blue-collar workers who worked 
night shifts, as well as morning papers' ability to deliver their 
editions earlier and the growing influence of evening television 
news as contributing to the decline. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, the News' sister paper, the morning Indianapolis  
Star, has a daily circulation of 235,790 readers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is just nobody at home in American families before 5, 6,  
sometimes 6:30 in the evening, and therefore there's nobody there 
to read,'' Caperton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shutdown of the News reflects a continuing trend in daily  
newspaper publishing. In 1998, according to the latest Editor &AMP; 
Publisher Year Book, 30 evening dailies converted to morning 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Although 46 of Indiana's 69 daily newspapers are published in  
the afternoon, only five of those afternoon dailies have a 
circulation of more than 20,000, said Dave Stamps of the Hoosier 
State Press Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``People come home from work now and they're not as likely to  
dive into a newspaper as they are other activities,'' Stamps said. 
``The idea of Ozzie Nelson coming home, putting his feet up and 
whipping out the newspaper (is dead); our lifestyles have just 
changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The News closing will leave 47 cities with two or more  
newspapers, according to figures compiled by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The closing seemed inevitable to reporters and editors, said  
Marc Allan, president of Local 70 of the Communications Workers of 
America/Newspaper Guild. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worked here for 11 and a half years, and it's been  
rumored every day that I've been here. So I don't think they're 
shocked. They're sad,'' Allan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The News' late-afternoon final, dubbed the Blue Streak, ceased  
publication shortly after the Jan. 21 death of longtime publisher 
Eugene S. Pulliam. Saturday editions of the News and the Star were 
combined in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The News and Star merged their newsroom staffs in 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	The News won a Pulitzer Prize for a 1930-31 campaign to reduce  
government spending and educate readers about how government 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
	The closing of the News is expected to result in a one-time,  
pretax charge of about $1.25 million for its parent company, 
Central Newspapers Inc. By closing the News, Central expects to 
save between $3 million and $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock rose 75 cents Tuesday, or by 1.8 percent, to  
close at $42.50 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Newspapers is a media and information company. Through  
its flagship newspapers, The Arizona Republic and The Indianapolis 
Star, it publishes the only major dailies in Greater Phoenix and 
central Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Newspapers also owns and operates several smaller  
newspapers as well as other related media and information 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle served on the board of Central  
Newspapers Inc. until January, when he decided to run for 
president. Quayle is the grandson of Pulliam. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing the paper will eliminate about 20 newsroom jobs, but  
most will be absorbed through existing openings and voluntary 
severance. No layoffs are expected, Duncan and union leader Allan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 12 transportation positions will be eliminated and there  
will be reduced shifts in other areas, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Sign First-Round Draft Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Jeff Foster, a first-round draft pick  
acquired in a trade from the Golden State Warriors, signed with the 
Indiana Pacers on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the agreement were dictated largely by the collective  
bargaining agreement and weren't disclosed by the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster, a 6-foot-11, 232-pound forward-center from Southwest  
Texas, was the 21st player picked in last month's draft. He was 
traded to Indiana for Vonteego Cummings, the No. 26 overall pick by 
the Pacers, and a future first-round choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to have this done, especially because it allows me  
to participate in the upcoming rookie-free agent camp,'' said 
Foster, who averaged 14.2 points per game as a senior and was third 
in the nation in rebounding at 11.3 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Camp is scheduled July 23-25 and the Pacers then head to Boston  
for a summer league hosted by the Boston Celtics July 26-Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster will likely have a chance for playing time early. The  
Pacers dealt six-year veteran Antonio Davis to Toronto last month. 
However, because of salary cap restrictions, the trade can't 
officially be announced until Aug. 1, when next season's cap is 
calculated. In exchange for Davis, the Pacers will obtain Jonathan 
Bender, a 6-11 prep center from Picayune, Miss.. He was the fifth 
overall pick in the draft.

<HEADLINE> Mutual Funds Costly for Beginners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mutual funds are the investment vehicle of  
choice for millions of Americans, but they're becoming more 
expensive for beginning investors to buy into. 
</P>
<P>
	Minimum initial investments, the money an investor must come up  
with to open an account with a fund, are going up. 
</P>
<P>
	American Century Investments, which has allowed investors to  
open accounts with only $50 as long as they have that much money 
automatically deposited each month, is ending that practice as of 
Oct. 1. All new investors will have to pay American Century's 
standard $2,500 minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund company has also raised the $500 minimum on its  
American Century Giftrust fund to $2,500 to bring it in line with 
its other funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Increasingly you're seeing higher minimums and the  
disappearance of very, very low minimums,'' said Burton Greenwald, 
a mutual fund consultant with his own firm, B.J. Greenwald 
Associates, in Philadelphia. ``What's driving this is the fact that 
the industry is much more sensitive to expense ratios.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that a proliferation of small accounts drives up  
a fund manager's expenses without providing much in the way of 
earnings. It costs the same amount to service an account whether it 
has $100 in it or $100,000 -- for example, it costs the same amount 
of money to print and mail reports to investors no matter how much 
they've put into a fund. 
</P>
<P>
	More savvy investors look for funds with lower expenses because  
ultimately it is the mutual fund investor who pays those expenses, 
in the form of a lower return. 
</P>
<P>
	As minimums increase, fund companies may actually be  
discouraging some people from getting started. But mutual fund 
investing has become so widespread that chances are those people 
with a lot of money to invest are already in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have penetrated the majority of households worthy of being  
penetrated,'' said mutual fund consultant Jeffrey Bobroff, of East 
Greenwich, R.I., noting that fund companies would find themselves 
with diminishing returns if they continued taking on a lot of new, 
small accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to take large blocks of assets rather than small  
ones,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some funds are lowering their minimums as a marketing tool,  
making it easier for new money to come in. 
</P>
<P>
	Driehaus Capital Management, which operates the Driehaus Mutual  
Funds, lowered the minimum on four small international funds to 
$10,000 from $100,000. The company said earlier this month it wants 
to make the fund more available to individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, this spring, Freemont Funds waived its minimum  
entirely on its Freemont U.S. Small Cap Fund so it can draw new 
money and increase its assets. 
</P>
<P>
	And TIAA-CREF Mutual Funds has an extremely low minimum of just  
$250 per fund, or in a plan similar to American Century's automatic 
investment policy, $25. The company is new to mutual funds, having 
established a long and successful record with annuities, and it's 
looking for business. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Greenwald, TIAA-CREF has been able to keep minimums  
down by keeping its expense ratio at a very low 0.49 percent, 
compared to the industry norm of 1.10 percent to 1.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``They make low cost and efficiency a critical part of their  
message to investors,'' Greenwald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of TIAA-CREF's strategy is that it is run as a nonprofit  
organization. It began as a retirement and financial services 
system for employees of colleges, universities, independent schools 
and other nonprofit education and research institutions. It doesn't 
have to generate a profit to satisfy stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Morningstar Inc., which tracks mutual fund data,  
there are currently 2,093 funds with minimum investments up to 
$1,000. Another 5,166 have minimums between $1,000 and $2,500, and 
1,360 have minimums between $2,500 and $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Between $5,000 and $10,000 there are only 310 funds. Above  
$10,000, there are 1,852, but most, with minimums above $100,000, 
are aimed at institutional investors such as pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
	A trend toward higher minimums does mean it will take some  
investors longer to get started. But ideally, if expenses are down, 
that should translate into higher returns.

<HEADLINE> Bush Campaign Says Claim Legitimate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- In 1978 campaign literature, George W.  
Bush said he served in the Air Force, a claim his presidential 
campaign says is legitimate based on time he spent training and on 
alert while a member of the Texas Air National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force says once a guardsman always a guardsman, even if  
called to active duty for training or another temporary assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential front-runner already had faced  
questions about whether he received preferential treatment when he 
joined the Guard during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	A pullout ad from The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal on May 4, 1978,  
shows a huge picture of Bush with a ``Bush for Congress'' logo on 
the front. On the back, a synopsis of his career says he served 
``in the U.S. Air Force and the Texas Air National Guard where he 
piloted the F-102 aircraft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush lost that congressional race in West Texas.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the statement that the Texas governor served in the  
Air Force, spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Tuesday that it was all 
``accurate.'' She said that while Bush was attending flight school 
from November 1968 to November 1969, he was considered to be on 
active duty for the U.S. Air Force. Also, at several times when he 
was serving in the Guard, he was placed on alert and considered to 
be on active duty as well, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked 607 days of active duty service during the training  
and alerts, according to the campaign. ``As an officer, he was 
serving on active duty in the Air Force,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	It may be a question of semantics.  
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force says that Air National Guard members are  
considered ``guardsmen on active duty'' while receiving pilot 
training. They are not, however, counted as members of the overall 
active-duty Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone in the Air National Guard is always considered a  
guardsmen and not a member of the active-duty Air Force, according 
to an Air Force spokeswoman in the Pentagon. A National Guard 
member may be called to active duty for pilot training or another 
temporary assignment, and receive active-duty pay at the time, but 
they remain Guard members. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have Reservists and Guard going through training all the  
time and they're considered active duty,'' Jim Teet, a public 
affairs spokesman at Laughlin Air Force Base at Del Rio, Texas, one 
of the bases where the Air Force teaches pilots to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	As running mate to Bush's father, George Bush, Dan Quayle had to  
defend himself against charges that he joined the Indiana National 
Guard to avoid service in Vietnam. Quayle is now seeking the GOP 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bush campaign should be afforded the opportunity to  
explain in detail Governor Bush's military record and 
achievements,'' said Jonathan Baron, Quayle's spokesman. ``Mr. 
Quayle has always described his service as National Guard time. 
I've heard him say he served in the National Guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., another Republican presidential  
candidate, was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. ``McCain has 
said frequently that honorable public service of all kinds is a 
credit to our country,'' his spokesman, Howard Opinsky, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions have been raised about whether Bush received  
preferential treatment in gaining entry to his National Guard unit. 
Reviews of Bush's military history showed he scored lower than 
other Guard applicants, but was accepted because he was one of a 
handful of applicants willing and qualified to spend more than a 
year in active training, as well as lots of time after training, 
flying single-seat F-102 fighter jets. 
</P>
<P>
	In another development, the Bush campaign said he never knew  
that a Dallas house he sold in 1996 had a restrictive covenant that 
said the premises ``shall be used for private dwelling purposes 
only and by white persons only, not excluding bona fide servants of 
any race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor did not know. The subject never came up,'' Ms.  
Hughes said. ``The broker who was at the closing confirmed that it 
never came up.''	   Broker Steve Collins helped Bush sell the house and has helped 
sell about 20 others like it on the block. He said the subdivision 
of 52 homes was platted in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that time there were restrictive covenants that prohibited  
minorities from living in the main dwelling,'' he said. ``These 
kind of restrictive covenants were not exclusive to this block. 
There are old deeds all over Dallas and I would say all over Texas 
and other states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said the language was not included in the deed that Bush  
received when he bought the house in 1988, but in the platting 
documents. Most homeowners never see those documents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To delete the wording, a homeowner would have to collect  
signatures from at least 75 percent of the subdivision's residents 
and go through a lengthy, cumbersome and potentially expensive 
process, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why would someone volunteer for that when they don't need  
to?'' Collins said. ``You don't gain anything by doing it. They 
don't mean anything.''

<HEADLINE> Medicare Worrying Drug Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Drug companies are lobbying hard against  
Medicare coverage for prescriptions, warning that research on new 
drugs for the elderly will depend on strong profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Profits attract investment, investment pays for research and  
research leads to the new cures and treatments that will help and 
heal patients,'' said Alan Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical 
Research and Manufacturers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concern is if you have government price controls, you  
would ratchet down revenues to the companies and that in turn could 
have adverse impact on investment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug makers' association has run newspaper ads in recent  
weeks aimed at raising public concern as lawmakers consider a White 
House proposal to offer new prescription coverage to all 39 million 
elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers who support adding a new drug benefit to Medicare call  
the warnings scare tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you have here is an extremely greedy and profitable  
industry that is ripping off the American people big time and uses 
their profits to put extraordinary pressure on Congress through 
campaign contributions to both parties not to move forward to 
protect American consumers,'' said Rep. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug companies' political action committees made more than $4  
million on campaign contributions leading up to the 1998 
congressional elections, according to the Center for Responsive 
Politics. In addition, several individual companies made large 
``soft-money'' contributions, which are unrestricted and are 
supposed to be used for party-building activities. Among them were 
Pfizer Inc., $747,050; Bristol-Myers Squibb, $559,975; and 
Novartis, $495,604. 
</P>
<P>
	The pharmaceutical industry reinvests about 20 percent of its  
revenue in research and development, and that's expected to total 
about $24 billion this year, higher than the National Institutes of 
Health budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, senior citizens and others who must buy drugs on  
their own are paying about twice as much as people enrolled in 
large health plans that negotiate bulk discounts, according to a 
study conducted by Democratic staff of the House Government Reform 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials estimate that if Medicare were  
to use its own bulk purchasing power to negotiate discounts through 
the same private benefit managers that many health plans use, 
retirees could save 10 percent to 15 percent on prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is simply ... allowing Medicare to get the same discounts  
for their beneficiaries that every other insurance provider can 
currently get for their beneficiaries,'' said White House economic 
adviser Gene Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts who watch pharmaceutical companies, however, are  
warning investors to pay close attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Medicare prescription drug benefit issue could have an  
adverse impact'' on the drug industry, said a June 24 report by 
Christina Heuer of Salomon Smith Barney in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmaceutical companies are working on 191 new medicines to  
tackle diseases associated with aging such as arthritis, 
osteoporosis and Alzheimer's, according to a survey by the 
drugmakers' association. 
</P>
<P>
	Such new treatments can be too expensive for many elderly and  
disabled Americans who have no prescription benefits under 
Medicare, drug makers concede. But they say their prices must take 
into account the time and money it takes to develop and test a new 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the new bioengineered drug Enbrel, introduced last  
year to treat rheumatoid arthritis, took the small Seattle-based 
company Immunex Corp. more than a decade and $300 million to 
develop. 
</P>
<P>
	Enbrel costs around $1,000 a month. That price is prohibitive  
for many who could benefit from the treatment -- as company 
officials know from phone calls and letters received from doctors 
and Medicare beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Medicare not to cover that doesn't seem to make a lot of  
sense,'' said Peggy Phillips, senior vice president at Immunex. 
``We are very interested in some kind of Medicare reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Immunex officials also point out that after 18 years in  
business, the company has only this year turned its first quarterly 
profit: $245,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmaceutical industry leaders say they could support  
alternatives to President Clinton's plan that would rely more on 
the private sector to bring drug coverage to retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	One such plan, supported by most members of an advisory  
commission that reported to Congress this year and praised by 
Republican leaders, would have Medicare contribute a limited amount 
toward the cost of private health insurance -- including drug 
coverage -- for retirees instead of paying their individual medical 
bills.

<HEADLINE> Kasich Withdrawing From GOP Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ohio Rep. John Kasich has decided to withdraw  
from the race for the Republican presidential nomination and 
intends to endorse the front-runner, Texas Gov. George Bush, 
Republican officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they  
expected Bush to be present for Kasich's formal announcement, set 
for early afternoon Wednesday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old Kasich prepared his departure to underscore his  
support for his party, at the same time another erstwhile 
Republican presidential hopeful, New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, was 
on the Senate floor laying out his reasons for leaving the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has left open the possibility of seeking the U.S.  
Taxpayers Party nomination for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich's campaign officials declined to comment on his  
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich and Smith made their decisions less than two weeks after  
Bush solidified his claim as front-runner in the GOP nomination 
race with record fund-raising of more than $36 million for the 
first six months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich -- as well as other hopefuls -- have been struggling to  
raise enough money to remain competitive in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican officials said they did not expect Kasich to reverse  
an earlier decision to retire from Congress at the end of his 
current term. The Ohio Republican was first elected to the House in 
1982. As chairman of the Budget Committee over the last five years, 
has wielded great influence over the spending cuts crafted by the 
Republicans, as well as their plan to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, he never became an officially announced candidate  
for the nomination, setting up an exploratory committee to finance 
his travels. But there was never any doubt that he was running 
hard, and he had made numerous trips to Iowa and New Hampshire, the 
states that will hold the first caucuses and primary of the 
campaign season in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls showed Kasich in single digits, and unable to break  
even into the tier of contenders closest to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	If anything, Smith had an even tougher time getting any  
political traction for his candidacy. Despite his standing as a 
senator from the nation's first-in-the-primary state, he did not 
have the support of any of the other three members of the New 
Hampshire congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks on the Senate floor, he said the Republican  
``establishment'' values getting elected more than their own 
platform, comprimising on issues like gun control and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's office in Texas did not immediately return a phone call  
about his plans for the day on Wednesday. The governor had 
previously been scheduled to be in the Washington area, though.

<HEADLINE> Capitol Architect Ups Safety Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The architect of the Capitol, cited for health  
and safety violations in the congressional workplace, formed a new 
division Tuesday to confront the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Life Safety Program Division will focus on workplace safety,  
fire protection and environmental concerns, architect spokesman 
Herb Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest five citations were announced Monday by the  
congressional Office of Compliance. The report concluded the 
architect's office endangered lives at the Library of Congress when 
untrained employees -- working on poorly maintained equipment -- 
accidentally started a fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire occurred April 30 at the library's Madison Building,  
which opened in 1980 and houses rare manuscripts, maps, books, 
musical instruments and a rough draft of the Declaration of 
Independence. The documents escaped damage, but an electrician was 
burned as the flash fire started. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to fire safety problems in other congressional  
buildings, including the U.S. Capitol, the architect's office has 
been criticized for improper storage of chemicals, the highest 
lost-time accident rate in the federal government, failure to 
monitor power plant water for the bacteria that causes Legionnaires 
Disease and futile attempts to start a recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin said the director of the division will be Phillip  
Tapper, a safety engineer from the Goddard Space Flight Center in 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennie Hardesty, a safety and occupational health professional  
from the Air Force, will be deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin said the architect's office has reduced its workforce  
from 2,400 to 2,000 in the last five years, and ``We're now 
regrouping and building up with new competencies. Life safety is a 
high priority.''

<HEADLINE> Immigration Changes Detention Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new interpretation of U.S. law could mean  
freedom for hundreds of nonviolent immigrants with criminal records 
being held awaiting deportation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Several court decisions concluded that the Immigration and  
Naturalization Service has more discretion under a 1996 immigration 
law than had been thought. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS action, announced Monday, affects certain criminal  
aliens who completed their criminal sentences prior to Oct. 9, 
1998, when mandatory detention provisions took effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The action essentially restores the discretion INS once enjoyed  
to free noncitizens with criminal records who are not believed to 
pose a danger to the community or a flight risk in advance of their 
final deportation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Provisions of the 1996 law that took effect in October 1998  
mandated that INS detain virtually all noncitizens whose criminal 
convictions -- occurring before or after passage of the law -- made 
them deportable. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the law also broadened the definition of crimes that  
would trigger deportation and included retroactivity provisions 
covering convictions prior to 1996, some noncitizens who had 
steered clear of crime after an earlier brush with the law suddenly 
found themselves behind bars under mandatory detention. 
</P>
<P>
	With the changes announced Monday, INS will initiate a  
case-by-case review. 
</P>
<P>
	INS Commissioner Doris Meissner stressed that no one deemed to  
pose a threat to public safety will be released under the new 
policy. Release decisions are subject to review by immigration 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 1996 act gave INS important new tools that have helped us  
reach record levels in the removal of criminal aliens,'' Meissner 
said in a news release. ``In one provision of the new law, at least 
13 federal courts have ruled that INS has greater flexibility in 
implementing the law's mandatory detention requirements than we had 
thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	INS officials, who had worried the mandatory detention  
provisions would overburden their already strained detention 
system, estimate their new interpretation could reduce the 
detention population of 17,400 by about 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	An author of the 1996 law, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who chairs  
the House Judiciary immigration subcommittee, had no comment 
pending review of the new INS policy, said spokesman Allen Kay. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, who had written Attorney General Janet Reno  
seeking a change to the mandatory detention policies, welcomed the 
INS action. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they are criminals and they are terrorists, yes, deport  
them,'' the Texas Democrat said. ``But if they are people who have 
been here 20, 30 years and are not a threat to our nation and are 
working, have a family, then we need to be conscious of that. They 
have a right to (be released on) bond.''

<HEADLINE> Media General Profit Down 24 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Media General Inc. reported a 24 percent  
decrease in profits for the second quarter, a drop it blamed 
largely on lower revenues in its newsprint production division. 
</P>
<P>
	The Richmond-based media conglomerate reported today that  
earnings for the quarter ended June 27 were $16.5 million, or 61 
cents per share, down from $21.5 million, or 80 cents per share, in 
the same period of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the drop, the results were well above analyst  
expectations of 55 cents per share, according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter also dropped. The company reported  
$199.6 million in revenues, down from $211.5 million for the second 
quarter of 1998. More than half of the decline was in newsprint, 
where revenues fell to $24.6 million from $31.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Newsprint segment results fell sharply, reflecting the  
significant decline in newsprint prices which approached five-year 
lows during the quarter,'' said J. Stewart Bryan III, the company's 
chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the first six months of the year was $27.8  
million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared with $34.3 million, 
or $1.27 per share, for the first six months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the first six months of 1999 decreased 4 percent to  
$391.4 million from $407.6 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Media General has interests in newspapers, broadcast television,  
recycled newsprint and information services.

<HEADLINE> Green Monster the Focus at Fenway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Billy Wagner, Sean Casey and a bunch of their new  
National League teammates could barely contain themselves. Not only 
was this their first All-Star appearance, but it was coming at 
Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw my first major league game there, back when I was in the  
Cape Cod League,'' Wagner said Monday. ``I remember walking up the 
runway and the Green Monster popping out. You never forget it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston reliever hoped to add to those memories tonight,  
preferably by preventing any AL hitter from clearing the famous 
left-field wall. Then there was 10-time All-Star Ken Griffey Jr., 
who planned to claim a piece of the park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chip some paint off the wall, put it in a bag and take it  
home,'' Griffey said. ``There's something I will take from this 
ballpark before I leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey made his mark Monday night, overcoming a monstrous  
performance by Mark McGwire to win the home run derby for the 
second straight year. It was his best effort yet at Fenway, where 
he's connected for only eight of his 379 career homers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good ballpark to hit in,'' Junior said. ``It's a  
classic. There are certain ballparks that have a lot of tradition 
behind them, and this is one of them. And before they tear it down, 
they've having an All-Star game here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just in time for 15-time All-Star Tony Gwynn.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the one old park I haven't played in,'' the San Diego  
outfielder said. ``I saw what Wade Boggs used to do here. I'm 
looking forward to doing it myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, tied with Boggs at 2,982 career hits, won't be able to  
help the National League try to extend its 40-28-1 edge. Hobbled by 
injuries, he'll sit out as Boston ace Pedro Martinez starts for the 
AL against Philadelphia's Curt Schilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gwynn wanted to take batting practice and maybe field a  
few balls off the wall. How excited was he about seeing Fenway? He 
had a book detailing the history of the ballpark in his hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, Casey was eager to take some swings in a park he'd  
only seen on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to try to hit a couple over in BP, just to say I hit  
one over the wall,'' the Cincinnati first baseman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz had other goals. Normally a right  
fielder, he was to start in left for the NL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope I don't get a bad bounce off the wall and get  
embarrassed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reds reliever Scott Williamson brought a camcorder to the home  
run derby and filmed all around Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have an opportunity to step on a field that Ted Williams  
played on, it's great,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who will throw out the ceremonial first ball, sounded  
less enthused about his old haunts. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I'm not sentimental about it. I want to see a new ballpark  
where the seats are bigger,'' the 80-year-old Splendid Splinter 
said. ``I've heard a lot of fans say, `Oh, geez, I wouldn't even 
think about going anyplace else.' It wasn't that great. The park is 
just an old park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a lot of history wrapped up in that wall.  
</P>
<P>
	At times, it was made of wood, brick, concrete and sheet metal.  
Now, the side facing the hitters is all tin and stretches about 240 
feet toward center field. 
</P>
<P>
	It became known as the Green Monster in 1947 when ads for  
Lifebuoy, Gem Blades and other products were covered up with green 
paint. There's also a thin ladder running to the top -- grounds crew 
members use it to retrieve balls that wind up in the 23-foot screen 
on top. 
</P>
<P>
	One other fact about the wall: The initials of former owner  
Thomas Austin Yawkey and his wife, Jean Remington Yawkey, appear on 
it in Morse code. Easy to overlook, a series of dots and dashes for 
``T-A-Y'' and ``J-R-Y'' show up in the vertical white lines to the 
left of pitchers' numbers on the out-of-town scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Bradley of the Red Sox hit the first shot over the wall on  
April 26, 1912 -- ``Few of the fans who have been out to Fenway Park 
believed it was possible,'' the Boston Herald reported the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Sammy Sosa hit his first major league homer over the Monster off  
Roger Clemens in 1989. McGwire hit 18 home runs at Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocky Colavito connected for the AL in the 1961 All-Star game at  
Fenway, stopped by rain after nine innings for a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams preferred to pull the ball to right. He put on a  
one-man show in the 1946 All-Star game at Fenway with two home 
runs, including a drive off Rip Sewell's ``eephus'' pitch, in going 
4-for-4 with five RBIs in a 12-0 rout. 
</P>
<P>
	Marked at 310 feet down the line in left, many believe the wall  
isn't even that far. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wall's 290 feet,'' Williams insisted. ``When I first got  
there in left field, they had a rise out there to let you know 
you're getting near the fence. But that was taken out. 
</P>
<P>
	``But still I knew the wall was only 290 feet. And I had a good  
conception of how close I was,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Nixes First HMO Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats trying to expand a GOP patients'  
rights bill lost the opening vote today as the Senate rejected 
their effort to allow women more options in choosing doctors and 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 52-48, mostly along party lines.  
</P>
<P>
	The amendment, the first in a series of votes this week, would  
have allowed women to designate obstetrician-gynecologists as their 
primary care doctors. It also would have made sure that a woman 
could stay overnight in a hospital after a mastectomy if her doctor 
recommended it. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came after another a day of rhetoric from both  
Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about political power in Washington trying to shut off  
something that is manifestly in the best interest of the average 
citizen of this country -- and not just the average citizen -- every 
single person covered by an HMO,'' President Clinton said at the 
White House before leaving for a Florida trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers would urge Clinton to veto the GOP bill if it reaches  
his desk, Clinton's top health aide, Chris Jennings, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP bill is a much more modest version of the Democratic  
``patients' bill of rights,'' covering fewer people and leaving out 
the right to sue if a patient is harmed by a denial of care. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is watered down,'' Clinton said. ``It is nowhere near what  
the American people deserve and need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate kicked off debate Monday amid pep rallies and  
high-pitched rhetoric. But the debate's early hours also showcased 
fundamental differences between Republicans and Democrats over the 
role of government. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really a difference in approach ... as profound as  
anything that divides Republicans and Democrats,'' Senate Minority 
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Monday as debate began. 
</P>
<P>
	His GOP colleagues did not disagree.  
</P>
<P>
	Democrats want a broad ``patients' bill of rights'' that covers  
as many Americans as possible, and that was the first issue to hit 
the Senate floor. Democrats also want to allow patients to sue HMOs 
and collect damages when HMOs withhold treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans want to minimize new federal regulations, covering  
only those people whose health plans don't fall under state laws. 
On at least a dozen issues, their bill takes a more limited 
approach than the Democrats do. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bizarre twist, each party preferred to debate the other  
side's legislation, hoping to spotlight its weaknesses. That led to 
Republican leaders introducing the Democratic bill, and the 
Democrats bringing forth the GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Republicans are all but certain to pass their  
legislation. But Democrats hope to win over a handful of 
Republicans on individual issues as they vote on a string of 
amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	Votes were expected today on issues including emergency room  
care, how many people are covered by the bill and a GOP proposal to 
allow the self-employed to take a tax deduction on the cost of 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	A final vote on the entire bill is set for Thursday. Republicans  
are expected to use the final amendment to substitute the 
legislation they prefer for whatever remains on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	Before a single vote was cast, the rhetoric was already flying  
high. 
</P>
<P>
	``We support a patients' bill of rights. Republicans support a  
patients' bill of wrongs, a bill of goods, a profit protection 
program rather than a patient protection program,'' Sen. Edward 
Kennedy, D-Mass., told to pep rally of some 200 cheering lobbyists 
and other supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-dozen human props wearing white doctors' coats lined up  
behind the podium. Among the speakers was Ray Cerniglia, who 
quietly talked about his son Matthew, who died at age 14 after his 
HMO refused to pay for a cancer treatment deemed experimental. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never realized our family would be fighting two battles --  
one against cancer, the other against my HMO,'' said Cerniglia, who 
lives in a Washington suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans staged a news conference of their own, packed with  
their own supporters. On hand was a father who runs his own 
business and can barely afford health insurance as it is. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you what will happen if the Kennedy bill happens --  
these young people will go uninsured,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, 
R-Idaho, gesturing toward the little girl in the pink checkered 
dress and eager young boy with round glasses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Benefits Coalition, a coalition of business and  
insurance groups that opposes new laws, set up a war room of sorts 
at nearby lobbyists' offices, complete with a phone bank and set of 
television sets to monitor debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats had a war room of their own, which they dubbed the  
Intensive Communications Unit, or ICU, where senators could do 
radio and TV interviews with hometown stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside Washington, lobbyists on both sides were airing  
advertisements aimed at GOP senators, most of them up for 
re-election next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance industry announced a $9 million campaign to change  
the image of managed care. And the AFL-CIO launched $500,000 worth 
of ads to air this week in eight states.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Cops in Fatal Shooting Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- The Riverside police chief has fired  
four white officers who shot and killed a 19-year-old black woman 
as she sat in her car, seemingly dazed with a gun in her lap, 
police union and city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Jerry Carroll gave the officers a piece of paper Monday  
outlining why they were being fired, said Detective Jeffrey Joseph, 
president of the Riverside Police Officers' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll had informed the officers of his intentions a month ago.  
He declined comment on the firings Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers fired were Paul Bugar, 24; Wayne Stewart, 26;  
Daniel Hotard, 23; and Michael Alagna, 27. 
</P>
<P>
	City Manager John Holmes said the officers were fired for  
violating department policies, although he would not disclose what 
those policies were, the Press Enterprise of Riverside reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Riverside County district attorney previously had criticized  
the officers' tactics but decided there was no criminal intent in 
the Dec. 28 shooting of Tyisha Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found Ms. Miller apparently unconscious in a locked car  
parked at a gas station. The four officers fired 23 bullets at her, 
hitting her 12 times, when she suddenly reached for a gun after an 
officer broke into her car to remove the weapon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting and subsequent decision by the district attorney  
prompted repeated demonstrations in the city 60 miles east of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller family attorney Andrew Roth said he supports the chief's  
decision but added that he wished it had come sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't predict what the police union or police officers'  
attorneys are going to do, but I fear they are going to fight 
this,'' Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
	The firings come four days after federal prosecutors announced  
they will conduct an investigation into whether the department has 
engaged in repeated civil rights violations 
</P>
<P>
	The state ended its own criminal investigation of the shooting  
by concurring with the district attorney's decision, but continues 
to review whether any state civil rights were violated. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago on Monday, the city police superintendent recommended  
the firing of four officers for their part in the fatal shooting of 
an unarmed black woman. 
</P>
<P>
	LaTanya Haggerty, 26, was a passenger in a car involved in a  
police chase on June 4 when she was shot and killed. Investigators 
said an officer mistook her cellular phone for a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers will be suspended 30 days without pay while the  
police board takes up the recommendation of Superintendent Terry 
Hillard. He said the officers ignored an order to call off the 
chase, fired without justification and failed to notify a 
supervisor promptly that shots had been fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights leaders and members of the clergy have staged  
several protests since the fatal shootings of Ms. Haggerty and an 
unarmed black man, a 22-year-old Northwestern University football 
player.

<HEADLINE> Gov't To Study Biotech Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to address concerns about genetically  
altered crops, the Agriculture Department will seek an outside 
review of the process it uses to approve new varieties and set up 
regional research centers to track their long-term effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all that biotechnology has to offer, it is nothing if  
it's not accepted,'' said Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who 
announced the steps in a National Press Club speech Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He stopped short of proposing that genetically altered food be  
labeled as such and said distrust of the crops, which is especially 
strong in Europe, is ``scientifically unfounded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman said he would ask an independent panel of scientists to  
review the Agriculture Department's procedures for approving new 
seed varieties. USDA also will conduct an internal review to make 
sure its regulatory and product-promotion functions are kept 
separate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scientists who evaluate and approve biotech products for  
the market must be free of any hint of influence from trade support 
and other nonregulatory areas within USDA,'' Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA has so far approved 50 varieties of crops that have been  
engineered to be resistant to insects, herbicides or plant viruses. 
Advocates say biotechnology has vast potential for developing crops 
that are more nutritious, need less water and have a variety of new 
uses, such as bananas that would inoculate children in developing 
countries against diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups fear genetically altered crops can be  
unhealthy and could harm the food chain if they escape from farms 
into the wild. They have asked the Food and Drug Administration to 
require the labeling of genetically modified food. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman ``may as well be on Monsanto's payroll,'' said Larry  
Bohlen, director of health and environmental programs for Friends 
of the Earth, referring to one of the biggest biotech companies. 
``He's telling the biotech industry's line and ignoring the real 
environmental alarm bells that we're hearing surrounding genetic 
engineered products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rebecca Goldburg, a scientist with the Environmental Defense  
Fund, praised Glickman for acknowledging the importance of consumer 
acceptance. ``He certainly admitted that these concerns are 
legitimate,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her group petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency on  
Tuesday to restrict the planting of corn that has been modified to 
kill a moth larva known as the European corn borer. Researchers at 
Cornell University recently discovered that pollen from the corn 
can kill the larvae of monarch butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing that finding, the European Commission said it would delay  
approval of pending requests to sell the corn variety. 
</P>
<P>
	While insisting there is no proof butterflies are actually being  
poisoned on the farm, Glickman said the research underscored ``the 
need to develop a comprehensive approach to evaluating long-term 
and secondary effects of biotech products.''

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Sign Convicted Drug Dealer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Robert Baker, a former Auburn receiver who  
spent 10 months in jail for drug trafficking, resumed his football 
career Tuesday when he joined the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	The undrafted rookie free agent took part in the start of the  
Dolphins' three-day mini-camp. He signed a one-year contract Monday 
for $175,000, the NFL minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our whole country and our lives are dealing with second  
chances,'' Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``A lot of people get 
second chances, whether it's a husband or wife or president or what 
have you. We decided to give him a second chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, 23, was released on parole March 22 after serving a  
fraction of his 15-year sentence. He was arrested in April 1998 for 
selling cocaine three times to undercover police. 
</P>
<P>
	``He realizes he made a mistake, but that's part of his past,''  
said Baker's agent, Rick Davis. ``He's paid for it and will pay for 
it the rest of his life. He just wants an opportunity and a second 
chance. The Dolphins have given him that, and he's appreciative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins' offense includes two other players trying to  
rebound from legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Receiver Tony Martin, a starter last year for the NFC champion  
Atlanta Falcons, faces a federal trial Aug. 2 on charges of 
laundering drug money. Rookie running back Cecil Collins spent a 
month in jail after pleading guilty to charges of fondling two 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	The 200-pound Baker, a native of Gainesville, Fla., caught 62  
passes for 896 yards and seven touchdowns in 1995-96 at Auburn. He 
also returned punts and kickoffs, which helps his chances of making 
the Miami roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker was academically ineligible in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a little rusty, but he'll get in the swing of things  
quickly,'' Davis said. ``Now it's up to Robert to show everybody 
what he can do.''

<HEADLINE> Brokerages Report Strong Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The stock market was good to Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.  
and Paine Webber Group in the second quarter, and both brokerage 
firms posted profits that beat analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch on Tuesday reported net earnings of $664 million,  
or $1.57 a share, compared with $540 million, or $1.31 a share in 
the second quarter last year. Industry analysts had forecast the 
New York brokerage firm would earn $1.46 a share, according to 
First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The positive news came less than 24 hours after Merrill's  
president and chief operating officer abruptly resigned. Herbert M. 
Allison Jr., 55, once the heir-apparent for the top job at Merrill 
was told over the weekend he was no longer in the running to 
succeed David Komansky, 60, chairman and chief executive officer, 
according to news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch is trying to redefine its business by allowing  
customers to trade stocks on the Internet. The strategy, which 
caused internal conflicts in the executive suites, has been 
embraced by customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill's new Unlimited Advantage investment accounts, which now  
allow online trading, grew an eye-popping 65 percent in the past 
five weeks to a total of $16.6 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's army of stock brokers, however, did a brisk  
business between April and June. Strong underwriting for stock and 
bond offerings coupled with fees for advising companies on mergers 
and acquisitions also helped the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch reported net revenues of $5.44 billion, up 9  
percent from $5.27 billion in the second quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We showed strength across the board,'' said Stanley O'Neal,  
chief financial officer of Merrill. He added that if the stock 
market continues on its upward path ``there's no reason in my mind 
why we shouldn't be able to perform at similar levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors pushed the company's shares up $1.37 1/2 to close at  
$79.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the year, Merrill earned $1.28 billion, or  
$3.02 per share, up 21 percent from $1.04 billion, or $2.57 per 
share, in the first half of last year. Net revenues were $10.71 
billion vs. $9.62 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Paine Webber reported profits of $157.6 million, or $1.02 a  
share, surpassing Wall Street's estimate of 94 cents a share, 
according to First Call. Those results were 27 percent better than 
the year-ago quarter when Paine Webber earned $123.6 million, or 82 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Net revenues totaled $1.35 billion vs. $1.16 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the year, profits totaled $324 million, or  
$2.02 a share, up from $250 million, or $1.59 a share, in the first 
half of 1998. Net revenues were $2.66 billion, compared with $2.28 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Paine Webber's shares fell 37 1/2 cents to close at $45.12 1/2 on the  
Big Board.
