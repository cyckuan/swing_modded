<P>
BANGKOK, February 11 (Xinhua)-- The 10th session of United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) will be held
from February 12 to 19, 2000 in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD was established by the U.N. General Assembly as one of
its permanent organs in December 1964. It plays a manifold role in
the ever-changing arena of trade and development. With developing
countries, particularly the least developed among them, in mind,
its role has been redefined in recent years to adapt to the
realities of globalization and liberalization.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD is one of the principal instruments of the General
Assembly for deliberation and negotiation in respect of
international trade and related issues of international economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As the focal point in the U.N. for the integrated treatment of
development and interrelated issues in the areas of trade, finance,
technology, investment and sustainable development, UNCTAD seeks
to maximize the trade and development opportunities of developing
countries. Its goal is to help them face the challenges arising
from globalization and to better integrate into the world economy.
UNCTAD's work is carried out through research and policy analysis,
consensus building at the intergovernmental level and technical
cooperation at the secretariat level.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD has about 190 members. China became a member of UNCTAD
in 1972. UNCTAD's headquarters is based in Geneva, employing some
420 people. Rubens Ricupero (from Brazil) is the current secretary
general of UNCTAD.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 35 years, international negotiations held under
UNCTAD's auspices have resulted in many international agreements
which have contributed to economic development in developing
counties. These include the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP)
, Agreement on a Global System of Trade Preferences (GSTP) among
developing countries and the Common Fund for Commodities which has
as its objective the stabilization of condition in the
international trade of commodities on which developing countries
heavily depend on.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD's organization includes Conference, Secretariat, Trade
and Development Board (TDB) as well as three Commissions.
</P>
<P>
The Conference is the organization's highest policy-making body
and normally meets every four years at ministerial level in order
to formulate major policy guidelines and to decide on UNCTAD's
forthcoming program of work.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD's secretariat undertakes policy analysis; monitoring,
implementation and follow-up of decisions of intergovernmental
bodies; technical cooperation in support of UNCTAD's policy
objectives; and information exchanges and consultations of various
types.
</P>
<P>
TDB is the executive body of UNCTAD, It comprises elected
representatives from 144 UNCTAD members and is responsible for
ensuring the overall consistency of UNCTAD's activities, as well
as those of its subsidiary bodies. The Board meets for a regular
annual session lasting about 10 days, at which it examines global
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
The three Commissions are respectively on Trade in Goods and
Services and Commodities; on Investment, Technology and Related
Financial Issues; and on Enterprise, Business Facilitation and
Development.

BANGKOK, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The 10th session of the United

costs to the weaker economies. Participants at the session
discussed the development strategies and policies of a globalized
world economy in the 1990s, the international trade after the
Uruguay Round, the facilitation for the integration of developing

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder (3)-- The 10th Session of UNCTAD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 11 (Xinhua)-- The United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) will hold its 10th quadrennial
session from February 12 to 19 in Bangkok, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The 10th session of UNCTAD will address the broad theme of "
Applying the lessons of the past to make globalization an
effective instrument for the development of all countries and of
all people." The session will engage in a stocktaking on
multilateral strategies for development and seek to forge a new
consensus among developed and developing countries about the
necessary tools for development, as well as the appropriate
internal and external environments.
</P>
<P>
The 10th session will examine how to harness globalization for
sustainable development of all countries. It will also provide a
great opportunity for an exchange of views and experiences with
regard to the economic crisis in Asia during the past two and a
half years. In addition, social development issues, particularly
women's rights, eradication of poverty and distribution of income,
will be given high priority.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the 10th session of UNCTAD will have the
potential to draw the focus back to the Asian region, to underline
the progress this region has made in recovering from the financial
crisis and to restore confidence in its economic potential.
</P>
<P>
After the spectacular failure of the World Trade Organization
to straighten out bitterly-divisive trade and related issues at
its meeting in Seattle in December, the Bangkok conference is
increasingly being seen as an appropriate venue not only to try to
put the crucial global trade talks back on track, but also to
provide a sense of direction on how to ensure successful
integration of all counties into the world economy on an equitable
basis.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the session, UNCTAD hopes to put out a Bangkok
Plan of Action, and hopefully a Bangkok Consensus, which will aim
to create a practical set of understandings on trade, finance,
investment, technological innovation and development strategies.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the Bangkok Consensus would become a global
commitment on the basis of partnership and mutual understanding
between developed and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that 3,000 delegates from all 190 UNCTAD members
will be attending the 10th session. Significantly, the majority of
the member states will be sending ministerial-level delegations.
Many heads of state and government are also expected to
participate in the conference's various high-level round tables,
interactive debates and general debate sessions.
</P>
<P>
Over and above the 3,000 delegates expected, there will be
spouses and other family members of the delegates,
parliamentarians and civil society representatives as will as
academics, the media and NGOs, all of whom should boost the number
of participants to some 6,000.

<HEADLINE> Movie-Goers Invade Berlin for Film Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The German capital will
benefit a lot economically from the 50th Berlin international film
festival, know as the Berlinale, currently under way as hundreds
of thousands movie-goers are expected to stream into the city for
the extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
Up to half a million people are expected to travel to Berlin
for the 12-day film festival as nearly 50,000 people per day are
coming to the city, said Juergen Wolf of Berlin Tourism Marketing.
</P>
<P>
"Berlin's image really gains from the Berlinale."
</P>
<P>
However, Wolf said: "Berlin isn't filled up yet. We have a lot
of rooms here."
</P>
<P>
The Berlinale was founded in 1951 in a politically motivated
act to add glamour to the divided Berlin city. Now the Berlinale
has become one of the world's most important film events.
</P>
<P>
Apart from its outstanding artistic characteristic of featuring
short films as well as lengthy ones, the Berlinale has also become
an "A-festival," which means movies screened must be premieres.
</P>
<P>
This applies to all films except for Hollywood productions,
which are screened first in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The current film festival was opened Wednesday night.

<HEADLINE> HK to Enforce New Air Pollution Control Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Regional government Friday proposed an amended air
pollution control rule in order to reduce the limit for benzene in
petrol to no more than one percent.
</P>
<P>
"The further reduction in the maximum benzene level in unleaded
petrol would give added protection to citizens of Hong Kong and is
a sensible precaution to take," said a government spokesman. The
present limit of no more than 5 percent for benzene in petrol has
been in force since April 1997.
</P>
<P>
Benzene is a carcinogen for human beings and petrol is a major
source of benzene. To enhance public health protection, the
international trend is to reduce benzene content in petrol.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with section 43 of the Air Pollution Control
Ordinance, the Secretary for the Environment and Food has made the
Air Pollution Control (Motor Vehicle Fuel) (Amendment) Regulation
2000, which is about to reduce the benzene content in unleaded
petrol from no more than five percent to no more than one percent.
</P>
<P>
"The move to tighten the benzene limit in petrol is part of an
ongoing program to improve the standards of motor fuels. Our motor
fuel standards are on a par with those in the European Union and
the United States," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The amended regulation will be tabled to the Legislative
Council on February 16. If no negative opinions would be put forth
by the Legislative Council, the amended regulation will come into
effect on April 1, 2000.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy to Visit Sudan Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Envoy to Sudan Hary
Johneston has expressed desire to visit Khartoum in March, said
Sudanese Presidential Advisor for Peace Affairs Nafe'a Ali Nafe'a
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark upon his arrival from Kenya where he met with
the U.S. envoy.
</P>
<P>
Informed political sources here said the Nairobi-based U.S.
charge d'affaires in Khartoum would pay a visit to Khartoum after a
year-and-half hiatus of his routine trips to the Sudanese capital
since August 1998, when U.S. warplanes struck a pharmaceutical
factory near Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has been banned from entering the country.
</P>
<P>
Washington recalled its diplomats in the Sudan a week before the
air raids on the alleged chemical factory and barred its nationals
from going to Sudan for a period due to end this month.
</P>
<P>
Khartoum has also planned to send a new ambassador to Washington
after it called back the ambassador in the wake of the U.S.
bombings under the pretext of curbing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The intended move has gained Washington's appreciation and was
seen as a start for improving the strained bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. attitude coincides with Egypt's recent moves meant
to revive the dialog between Sudan and the U.S. in a bid to push
forward an Egyptian initiative for peace in the war-torn north
African country.

<HEADLINE> Dozens of Illegal Demonstrators Detained in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police arrested dozens
of human rights activists before they could march in central
Istanbul to protest what they called government's failure to stop
human rights abuses, reported the Anatolia News Agency on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 demonstrators gathered in the central Tunel District
of the country's largest city to begin a rally, organized by the
Istanbul branch of the Human Rights Association.
</P>
<P>
But police stopped their march on the ground that the organizers
of the demonstration had not obtained the necessary permission from
the authorities concerned. Police cordoned them off at the small
square where they gathered and later forced them on board police
buses to be taken to custody.
</P>
<P>
Western countries and human rights groups have been criticizing
the Turkish authorities for allegedly failing to stop torture,
especially during police and paramilitary gendarmerie
interrogations.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit stated that it was not the
government's policy if torture ever happened in Turkey. He pledged
to do away with such things and other kind of abuses last December
after the European Union at its Helsinki summit granted Ankara
candidate status for membership of the 15-member European club.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
deployed troops in the Rwenzori mountains and in the lower lands
of the southwest district of Bundibugyo to fight the rebel Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF).
</P>
<P>
The banditry in the border region will be eliminated soon, said
 President Yoweri Museveni, who is now on a visit to the western
district of Bundibugyo, on Saturday while addressing the people of
Panala sub-county.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the President's Office,
Museveni appealed to displaced people in the area to go back to
their hometown since the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF)
will guarantee their security.
</P>
<P>
ADF rebels entered western Uganda last year to launch publicity
attacks on security and soft targets. So far dozens of innocent
people have been killed, with tens of thousands living in
displaced camps.
</P>
<P>
ADF rebels, who are based in the eastern part of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, have been fighting the Museveni
administration since 1996. They are composed of various rebel
groups and soldiers of former regimes.

<HEADLINE> 17 Civilians Killed by Islamic Militants in Algeria  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Three separate attacks launched
by Islamic insurgents in Algeria killed seventeen people last week,
local newspaper reports said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, seven were killed on Thursday near Berrouaghia, 70
kilometers south of capital Algiers, when a group of militiamen
sprayed bullets at a queue of vehicles, according to the Le Martin
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Another seven people, including three security guards, died on
Wednesday in an ambush in Tissemsilt, 350 kilometers west of
Algiers, La Tribune newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, three people were killed at a small beach
resort in Tipaza, 70 kilometers west of the capital, said the
Liberte daily.
</P>
<P>
The fatalities occurred as government forces for the last three
weeks have been enforcing a crackdown on radical militants who
refused to lay down their arms in exchange for amnesty.
</P>
<P>
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika had promised to pardon
Islamic militants who surrendered their arms by January 13, for a
national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The north African country has been torn by a civil war since
early 1992 after the military-backed government canceled a second
round of legislative elections that the Islamic Salvation Front was
poised to win. So far 100,000 people have died in the conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Italian Former Champion Calls Bigger Event in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 12 (Xinhua) -- In order to win back the interest
of the Italian public in skiing investment must be made in both
the new generation of Italian skiers and in organizing important
events in Italy, retired Italian champion Deborah Compagnoni said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Attending the World Cup races being held in Italy's Santa
Caterina Valfurvahere, her home town, near Sondrio, Compagnoni
observed "It is important to get people talking more about skiing
and in order to do this investment must be made in international
events, creating new events, reducing the splintered nature of the
circuit, revise the calendar and invest in the young."
</P>
<P>
In reply to observations that Italians appear to have lost
interest in skiing after she and Alberto Tomba retired from
competitive skiing, Compagnoni said "I think that when we were
racing there was a great increase in attention towards skiing. But
started before us and it was gradual. It is normal that it then
fell off, but it will pick up again."
</P>
<P>
After pointing out that Isolde Kostner was now winning races,
Compagnoni observed that in the hearts of fans "No one can replace
anyone else, just like Tomba did not replace Gustav Thoeni. What I
means to say is that everyone carves out their own niche,
definitive and different place."
</P>
<P>
Looking at the new generation of Italian women skiers.
Compagnoni cited Lucia Recchia and said "She looks really good,
determined and well disciplined. But there are others also,
especially in the giant slalom."
</P>
<P>
Turning her attention to her own retirement, at the end of last
season, Compagnoni said "It was a choice which sooner or later had
to be made. I didn't have any more stimulus and I was having
physical problems. I left when I had already done all I could do
and when I was no longer satisfied with my results. No regrets,
also because a race involves long, hard training and I was a bit
tired."
</P>
<P>
Compagnoni now works in the sportswear business, and she had no
plans to return to professional skiing in an official
administrative position, also because she had never been
approached for such a post.

<HEADLINE> Fatherland Yet to Decide Whether to Support Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Fatherland movement
said Saturday that it would consider supporting Acting President
Vladimir Putin in the upcoming presidential elections only if he
produced a program acceptable to them.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov, attending a meeting of the Fatherland movement, said they
first wanted to see Putin's manifesto, which the acting president
says is still being drafted.
</P>
<P>
"To take a stand on backing him (Putin), we need clear answers
on issues of concern to the country and guarantees that he will
pursue policies in keeping with Fatherland's aims and goals,"
Luzhkov said.
</P>
<P>
Putin is by the most popular politician in Russia, far ahead of
his nearest rival, Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
So far, only Zyuganov and one other candidate have been
officially registered for the polls scheduled for March 26. Putin
is expected to be declared a candidate next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov confirmed in his address that he would stay out of the
race. Primakov announced last week that he would not run.
</P>
<P>
Both had been seen as viable contenders in the presidential
race, but the bloc they lead, Fatherland-All Russia, performed
poorly in last December's parliamentary elections in the wake of
fierce media coverage unfavorable to them.
</P>
<P>
"If (Putin) campaigns with a program in conformity, close to or
perhaps in unison with the ideas upheld by Fatherland, then our
relationship with him will, of course, be positive," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Another contender for the Kremlin, liberal Grigory Yavlinsky of
the Yabloko party, submitted all necessary documents and the
required half million signatures of supporters on Saturday to the
Central Election Commission.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges Turkey to Change Position on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos Saturday called on neighboring Turkey to change its
stance toward the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference in the northern Greek city of
Thessaloniki Saturday, Tsohatzopoulos said that the latest
developments gave the capability to the governments of Greece and
Cyprus to claim the change of the Turkish policy on Cyprus, which
has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled south and the
Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed coup seeking union with Athens, the Thessaloniki-based
Macedonian Press Agency (MPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Cyprus' entry into the European Union (EU)
became definite at the EU Helsinki summit regardless of the
solution of the problem on the island.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Turkey had an obligation to adjust to
the European status quo and the terms of Copenhagen in combination
with the improvement of its relations with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The two communities on Cyprus have held two rounds of the U.N.-
sponsored proximity talks in New York and Geneva respectively in
order to resolve the division problem, and their third round of
such talks will take place in New York in May.
</P>
<P>
Greece and the Cyprus Republic-led by Glafcos Clerides maintain
that a federal solution to the Cyprus issue is the only basis for
discussion in line with U.N. resolutions, but Turkey and the
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash demand that northern Cyprus,
illegally declared in 1983 and recognized only by Turkey, be
recognized internationally as a prelude to reunification in the
form of a two-state confederation.

<HEADLINE> Italy Calls For EU Action on Danube Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian vice Foreign Minister
Umberto Ranieri said in Florence on Saturday that the European
Union "must decide immediately to intervene and deal with the
Danube emergency", caused by tons of cyanide poison which spilled
into a tributary river and now threatens the Danube river and the
whole Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
The EU, he added, should already have moved to help restore the
navigability of the Danube, interrupted during Allied bombing of
Serbia during the conflict over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Enormous damage was made to links of communication," he said,
"which are vital to the economy and mobility in the region. Italy
supports an anti-pollution plan and one for the restoration of
river navigation and encourages the European Union to accept the
requests made by nations bordering on that river."
</P>
<P>
In related developments, the World-Wide Fund for nature (WWF)
said in Rome Saturday that thousands of migratory birds, like
pelicans, herons ands swans, which in this seasons are building
nests for breeding, risk being killed if the wave of cyanide
reaches the delta of the Danube River and creates an ecological
disaster.
</P>
<P>
The Danube Delta, WWF said, was one of the four most important
natural breeding grounds for migratory aquatic birds in Europe,
along with the Po Delta, the Camargue in France and Spain's Coto
Donana, which suffered an environmental incident two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The arrival of the cyanide tide," WWF added, "is a time-bomb
for the Danube Delta and tragically brings to light the lack of
controls on mining operations and the stockhousing of toxic
substances used in mining."
</P>
<P>
Reports from Belgrade said the cyanide wave is 50 kilometers
long and moving at a speed of 5 to 6 kilometers per hours, leaving
nothing alive in its wake and crating a chain-reaction of
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Yugoslav officials said, the tide is beginning to
diluted and after registering cyanide levels 20 times the
acceptable level Friday, today the levels were only twice the
acceptable amount, some 20 kilometers from the Hungarian border.
</P>
<P>
The picture remain very bleak in Hungary where a generation of
river fish has been killed and surviving fish risk extinction
because the plants they live off have killed. Birds which live of
the fish also risk poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Some experts are going so far as to say that the cyanide spill
from a gold smelting plant in Romania is second only to the 1986
nuclear Chernobyl disaster in the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The incident began on January 31 when melting snow flooded a
reservoir used to hold the toxic substance which in turn
overflowed sending at least 100,00 tons of contaminated water down
stream through Hungary and then Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Pressure to Halt Israeli Attack on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Saturday called for international pressures on Israel
to halt its attacks on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call to his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine,
Kharrazi condemned the Israeli strikes in the past few days and
accused Israel of violating the cease-fire agreement signed between
Israel and Lebanon in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, the incumbent
chairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, has
expressed grave concern over the Israeli attacks and sent letters
to heads of Islamic countries over the issue.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, Kharrazi
also voiced the concern of Islamic states over Israeli attacks and
underlined the need of international aids to the Lebanese
government to reconstruct the damaged regions.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine also condemned the Israeli air raids on residential
units and civilian infrastructures in Lebanon and stressed that
efforts should be made to guarantee respect for the 1996 accord.
</P>
<P>
Under the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Lebanon, the
belligerent sides have no right to attack each other's civilian
targets.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes launched air strikes on Lebanese civilian and
guerrilla targets, in retaliation for guerrilla offenses which
killed seven Israeli soldiers in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Israel accused the pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrilla of violating
the agreement first by attacking Israeli forces from villages.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to end Israeli
occupation of south Lebanon since 22 years ago. Believed to be
backed also by Syria, it scored a series of attacks after Syrian-
Israeli peace talks were suspended on January 17.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Grants Amnesty to Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah
Seyed Ali Khamenei Saturday pardoned a number of prisoners on the
occasion of the 21st anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
According to the amnesty, male prisoners above 60 years of age,
female prisoners above 50, and those suffering from epidemic or
incurable diseases are set free.
</P>
<P>
The leader also pardoned the prisoners who had committed crimes
when they were under 18, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei commuted the terms of the prisoners sentenced to one
year to three months, and of those between one and five years to
one third of their original terms.
</P>
<P>
Prisoners who have served five years of their life terms are to
be mitigated to 15-year imprisonment, except for those found guilty
of being involved in murder, whose release will depend on a pardon
from parents of the victims.
</P>
<P>
The women prisoners who lost husbands while in prison and whose
children have no wage-earners were also pardoned under the amnesty,
which was proposed by the Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi
Shahroudi.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not clear how many prisoners were pardoned or
their prison terms commuted under the amnesty decree.
</P>
<P>
Iran's "10-day Dawn" celebration culminated on Friday to mark
the Islamic revolution in 1979 which toppled the late pro-U.S.
Shah's regime.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Continues Attack on Israeli Troops in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Hezbollah guerrillas launched
missiles at Israeli troops in south Lebanon Saturday, one day after
a seventh Israeli soldier was killed and another seriously wounded
there.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate reports of casualties from the 1:45 p.m.
(1145 GMT) attack, said security officials on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas fired several U.S.-made TOW missiles at the Radar
outpost in Bayyada which overlooks the southern port city of Tyre,
about two kilometers from the Israeli border, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut claimed responsibility
for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The attack came amid worsening situation in south Lebanon as
Hezbollah stepped up its offensive against Israeli troops and their
allied South lebanon Army (SLA). Israel retaliated by air-raiding
suspected Hezbollah targets and civilian infrastructures in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed purpose of protecting its north from cross-
border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
since spearheading a resistance movement to oust the Israeli troops
and the SLA from the country.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed
Esmat Abdel-Meguid phoned U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Daniel Kurtzer
to express the "anger and condemnation prevailing in the Arab and
Muslim world toward this dangerous aggression."
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the 22-member league said Abdel-Meguid
urged the United States to help end Israel's aggression "in order
for just and comprehensive peace to prevail in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes knocked out three power stations in Lebanon on
early Tuesday in retaliation for escalated Hezbollah attacks.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Pakistan Start Meetings on Trade, Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi-Pakistani Joint
Committee for Trade and Economic Cooperation started its seventh
session Saturday here in a bid to boost bilateral trade and
economic ties, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Minister of Housing and Reconstruction Maan Abdallah
Sarsam and the visiting Pakistani Minister of Commerce, Industry
and Production Abdur Razzaq Daud co-chaired the opening session,
said INA.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed means of expanding trade and economic
cooperation between the two countries, and decided to set up three
sub-committees dealing with trade and financial affairs, economic
affairs and scientific and technical affairs.
</P>
<P>
Daud confirmed his country's readiness to supply Iraq with goods
under the U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food program and the Pakistani
companies' readiness to participate in rehabilitating Iraq's oil
projects and electricity stations.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, now in its seventh phase, Iraq is
allowed to sell limited amount of oil every six months to buy
humanitarian supplies for its people who are hardest hit by the
decade-old sanctions imposed on the country following its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani minister, who arrived here Friday evening leading
a delegation representing the private and public sectors, condemned
the continuation of the "unjust embargo" imposed on the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
He called for an immediate lifting of the decade-old sanctions
and allowing Iraq to return to the international community.
</P>
<P>
Daud said his delegation will sign two accords with the Iraqi
Trade Chambers and Union of Industries. But he did not elaborate.

<P>
CAIRO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The car maker Tofas, a subsidiary of Turkey's
conglomerate Koc Holding, planned to increase its exports volume
this year to 328 million U.S. dollars, up by 160 percent from last

<P>
"The decision has shaken confidence among nationalists and

suspended the province's power sharing government because of lack
of progress by the IRA on disarmament.

<HEADLINE> IRA Must "Convince" Protestants on Arms: Trimble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Ulster
Unionist leader David Trimble said on Saturday that the Irish
Republican Army must say "whether, how and when" they are going to
disarm before he can again form a government with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
Trimble made the comments in Belfast after meeting his party's
860-member ruling council following the suspension of Northern
Ireland's political institutions on Friday, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson announced that
legislation to suspend the assembly and its executive would come
into force by midnight on Friday because there had not been
sufficient movement on the arms issue.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams had claimed an 11th hour move
by the IRA could have averted the suspension of the political
institutions, but Trimble rejected new commitments from the IRA to
the decommissioning body as "too vague".
</P>
<P>
Trimble demanded "clarity" from republicans on their intentions
to decommission. However, he did not say that IRA weapons
decommissioning must actually start before his party would be
prepared to re-enter the assembly.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting, Trimble received the overwhelming backing of
his party on the way he has decided to proceed.
</P>
<P>
At an earlier meeting in November, the Ulster Unionist Council
allowed Trimble to form a power-sharing executive with Sinn Fein
on condition that the decommissioning of IRA guns had started by
January 31.
</P>
<P>
Trimble gained their support by staking his position as First
Minister of the assembly, writing a post-dated resignation letter,
which has been held by the party president.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the assembly prevented the letter from coming
into force.
</P>
<P>
Trimble was under pressure from hardliners in his party to
regain some ground in any new review of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
They were hoping to try to stop proposed changes to the Royal
Ulster Constabulary with a motion linking it with decommissioning
as a precondition to re-entering the Assembly and its executive.
</P>
<P>
But the UUC has only passed a resolution saying that it
endorses a statement made by the party executive earlier this week
condemning change to the RUC name and symbolism.
</P>
<P>
Trimble also said that a working party would be set up to
consider the other issues as well as IRA decommissioning that the
party would be focusing on going into a new review of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He added that he and his party ministers would not re-enter the
assembly without again consulting the UUC.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the Assembly on Friday was followed by a
second report from Canadian general John de Chatelaine, in charge
of the body overseeing decommissioning, which said the IRA was now
considering how to put guns and explosives beyond use.
</P>
<P>
General de Chastelain said: "The (IRA) representative indicated
to us today the context in which the IRA will initiate a
comprehensive process to put arms beyond use, in a manner as to
ensure maximum public confidence."
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said the report contained the potential for him to
reverse his decision to suspend the institutions.
</P>
<P>
He accepted that the IRA had shifted its position significantly
from that which it held two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
But he added: "The IRA's position is still quite unclear in
certain key respects, notably if they will actually decommission
and when. Those are two very important questions which remain
unanswered."
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein was angered by what they said was the Northern
Ireland Secretary's refusal to take the new IRA statements into
account before suspending the assembly.
</P>
<P>
But despite the widening gap between the unionist and
republican positions on arms, Trimble is to meet Sinn Fein
President Gerry Adams next week to try to find a way forward.
</P>
<P>
It is likely that the meetings will take place during a pause
in the peace process allowing the parties to reflect on events

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plane Lands with Hydraulic Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reports quoted airport spokeswoman Suzanne Luber as saying
that the MD-80 landed safely and the 149 people aboard were taken
off without any problems.
</P>
<P>
Luber said she didn't know the nature of the problem but that
the plane's pilot had radioed that the jet had hydraulic failure
and requested an emergency landing. Flight 299 was en route to
Phoenix from St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
No survivors have been found following the January 31 crash of
the Alaska Airlines MD-83 with 88 people from Puerto Vallarta,
Mexico. The plane, which plunged into the Pacific Ocean about 65
kilometers northwest of Los Angeles, was en route to San Francisco,
and then Seattle.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration this week ordered all
planes in the MD-80 series inspected. Whether the TWA plane had
been inspected wasn't immediately known.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. government-mandated inspections found at
least three jetliners Friday with the same tail wing problem that
has become the focus of the investigation into the crash of the
Alaska Airlines plane.
</P>
<P>
A total of six aircraft, including the plane crashed, had
unusual metal shavings in their tail wing assemblies, the U.S.
National Transportation Safety Board said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Agriculture Secretary Opposes Taiwan Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Agriculture Secretary
Dan Glickman said that the U.S. government is strongly opposed to
the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act.
</P>
<P>
This legislation is not enacted by the U.S. government and it
does not represent the position of the Clinton administration,
Glickman said here Friday at a joint press briefing after a
meeting with Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. Li Zhaoxing.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton has already made it clear that he will veto
the legislation when necessary, Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
On China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), the
agriculture secretary said that since the agriculture agreement
between the U.S. and China came into effect at the end of last
year, China has proved itself that the country is committed to its
promises and is sincere in carrying out the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Glickman said the U.S. agriculture sector firmly supports China
's entry into WTO and is sparing no effort in pressing the
Congress to grant China the permanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR)
status unconditionally as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Chinese ambassador Li Zhaoxing warned that the Taiwan Security
Enhancement act, if approved by the Congress and became law, will
have "disastrous" impact on the stability in the Taiwan Straits
and the peaceful reunification of China as well as on China-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
It is an extremely dangerous political act which severely
infringes on the sovereignty of China and brutally interferes in
China's internal affairs, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The act violates principles of the three joint communiques
governing China-U.S. relations and the U.S. government's
commitment to the Taiwan issue, Li added.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached between China and the U.S. on China's
accession to WTO is a "win-win" pact, Li Zhaoxing said, adding
that granting permanent NTR status to China at the earliest date
is not only important in promoting trade relations between the two
countries but also in the interest of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador said China strongly opposes any link
between the permanent NTR status and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Later Friday, Li Zhaoxing also met with U.S. Senate President
Pro Tempore Strom Thurmond and expressed his concern over the
serious impact of the Taiwan Security Enhancement act on China-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
Thurmond, 98, told the Chinese ambassador that he supports the
"one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
It is in the interest of world peace and the two peoples for
the United States and China to get along peacefully and friendly
and enhance cooperation, Thurmond said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Urges People to Vote for Draft Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Saturday said he feels that the majority of Zimbabweans
will vote for the draft constitution because it gives them a
chance to become fully independent.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe told reporters soon after casting his vote in the
historic referendum at Kutama Day Primary School that the major
highlight of the draft constitution was the land issue.
</P>
<P>
He said it was improper for the people to continue holding on
to land benefiting from the colonial legacy.
</P>
<P>
He said there were many sections in the draft constitution that
 expressed the authority of Zimbabwe and people and the country as
a sovereign state, adding that it was not proper for opposition
political parties to contest against the draft constitution
because it contained the views of the people.

<HEADLINE> Developing Nations Want to Share Globalization Benefit: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said here on Saturday that the theme of the 10th
Session of the United Nations Conference on trade and development
(UNCTAD X) is most appropriate as the developing countries want to
share the benefit of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first plenary session of UNCTAD X , Mahathir
said the current conference is timely in the light of recent
developments impacting the global economy, particularly of
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization and directions for the 21st Century" is the main
theme of UNCTAD X.
</P>
<P>
"Many of us have on our own undertaken liberalization measures
by opening our markets to trade and investment, evolving
institutional and regulatory systems, orientating our economies to
external challenges and eventually welcoming globalization in the
hope of benefiting from the opportunities afforded by this process,
" Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
The path of development has never been easy even at the best of
times, he said .
</P>
<P>
"Despite of our efforts, we see rising inequality between
developed and developing countries, with continued high levels of
poverty and unequal and inequitable benefits from globalization,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We see increasing uncertainty of the global economic
environment and greater marginalization as a result of the
globalization process and growing inadequacy of global
institutions to deal with development problems," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the global financial system , Mahathir said the instability
in the global financial system has also adversely affected the
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir warned that the developing countries would remain
vulnerable to another crisis unless reforms are made to the
existing international financial system.
</P>
<P>
He said he was confident that the deliberations during UNCTAD X
will produce concrete results that will set a new direction for
development.

<HEADLINE> French Judicial Authorities to Hold Hearing on Sunk Tanker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The French judicial authorities
will hold a hearing next Monday with Italian ship classification
company Rina over the sinking of an oil tanker off France's west
coast last December.
</P>
<P>
Erika, the oil tanker, split into two parts and sank during a
tempest off Brittany, west coast of France on December 12 last
year, resulting in one of the biggest ecological disasters in
French history. Rina issued a certification to Erika before the
disaster took place.
</P>
<P>
Parisian judge of investigation Dominique de Talance will
question the leaders of Rina in collaboration with the Italian
authorities, reported Agence France Presse Saturday, quoting the
Italian judicial sources in Genova, Italy.
</P>
<P>
An official report by French investigators said that Rina is
partly responsible for the disaster, because it failed to make a
proper technical check of the ship, which the investigators said
had a "structural problem".

<HEADLINE> Make the Poor Benefit From Globalization: U.N.Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-
General Kofi Annan Saturday asked the 10th Session of the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X) to discuss
a series of questions on how to make the poor benefit from
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Delivering an opening speech at the inaugural ceremony of
UNCTAD X, the U.N chief said the conference should consider how to
make the poor benefit from trade work and how to make all
developing countries, especially poor people within them, benefit
from the growth of private investment and can borrow at affordable
rates.
</P>
<P>
He asked the conference to think about how the new technologies
can be made more widely available and better used and how to offer
external assistance in helping small-scale entrepreneurs in
developing countries to find their way around in the international
markets.
</P>
<P>
Annan also urged the delegates to think about how to develop
new partnerships, reaching beyond old-fashioned inter-governmental
cooperation, to advance the cause of development, how to ensure
the voice of developing countries not only be heard but also
listened to in future discussions on international trade rules and
how to enable the least developed countries to take their place on
the "upward escalator of world growth."
</P>
<P>
Annan said the ministerial meeting of the World Trade
Organization in Seattle last December failed because governments --
particularly those of the world's leading economic powers -- could
not agree on their priorities.
</P>
<P>
He said the developing countries, helped by UNCTAD, played "a
more active and united role" at the meeting than in previous
conferences, saying the industrialized countries remained locked
in arguments among themselves.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 people, including delegates from 188 UNCTAD
members, officials from key U.N. agencies such as the
international Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the World
Trade Organization (WTO), and representatives of non-governmental
organizations, national parliaments and civil society attended the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which ends on February 19, will address the
broad theme of "applying the lessons of the past to make
globalization an effective instrument for the development of all
countries and all peoples."

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The 10th session of the Untied
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X) opened here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 people, including delegates from 188 UNCTAD
members, officials from key U.N. agencies such as the
International Monetary fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization
(WTO), as well as representatives of non-governmental
organizations, national parliaments and civil society attended the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai and other eight heads of state or government of ASEAN (
Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries were also
present.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the Bangkok UNCTAD conference should consider the
following seven questions:
</P>
<P>
-- How can the poor benefit from trade work;
</P>
<P>
-- How can all developing countries, especially poor people
within them, benefit from the growth of private investment and can
borrow at affordable rates;
</P>
<P>
-- How can new technologies be made more widely available and
better used;
</P>
<P>
-- How to offer external assistance in helping small-scale
entrepreneurs in developing countries to find their way around in
the international markets;
</P>
<P>
-- How to develop new partnerships, reaching beyond old-

development;
</P>
<P>
-- How to ensure the voice of developing countries not only to
be heard but listened to in future discussions on international
trade rules;
</P>
<P>
-- And how to enable the least developed counties to take their
place on the upward escalator of world growth.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan said that Thailand is trying to put
the lessons of the financial crisis that have been learnt to good
use.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand hopes that the current UNCTAD meeting, the
first major United Nations conference of the new millennium, will
serve as the first opportunity to assess what is lacking in the
present international trade and financial system that has yet to
provide common prosperity and economic security for all.
</P>
<P>
In the following week, participants are expected to discuss a
wide range of issues like globalization, trade liberalization,
trade in services, electronic commerce and ways to narrow the gap
between rich and poor countries.
</P>
<P>
As the first global economic gathering in the new millennium
and the first major economic conference after the failed WTO
meeting in Seattle last December, the Bangkok UNCTAD session has
been expected to serve as a "healing process" for the Seattle
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Urges UNCTAD to Help Build New Compact for Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai Saturday urged the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development to provide the moral and ethical leadership for the
building of a new Global Compact for Development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 10th Session of the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X) here,
Chuan said the compact should be based on justice, equity and
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We have a unique opportunity at UNCTAD X to achieve this, for
this United Nations Conference is unlike any of its predecessors,"
he said, citing the fact all the heads of international and
regional institutions, the U.N. system and the Breton Woods
institutions and also representatives of civil society from non-
governmental organizations, the business community, academia and
the media from all parts of the world are attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the timing of UNCTAD X has its symbolic importance,
since it provides the international community an opportunity to
exchange views on how to forge a common vision of development for
the new millennium in the face of the challenges of globalization.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization has brought with it both opportunities and
challenges. Undeniably, its negative effects -- together with our
own weakness -- had led to a severe and far-reaching economic
crisis in our region," the Thai prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
As Thailand is emerging from the crisis, he said, the country
is trying to put the lessons that have been learnt to good use.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that UNCTAD X will help us all understand those
lessons even better for the benefits of all countries," he said,
adding that the gathering is the first major U.N. conference of
the new millennium and the first opportunity to assess what is
lacking in the present international trade and financial system
that has yet to provide common prosperity and economic security
for all.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 people, including delegates from 188 UNCTAD

<HEADLINE> U.N. Should Reconsider Stance on Myanmar: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and the
international community should reconsider their position on
Myanmar and offer the country assistance and cooperation, Myanmar
Foreign Minister Win Aung said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the first summit between leaders of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the United
Nations, held here earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Win Aung said the Myanmar government is trying to create
democratization in the country by promoting economic and social
development and that the U.N. system should not close the door to
the Myanmar government.
</P>
<P>
"Should the U.N. system and the international community come
after democratization is achieved in Myanmar or (should they) come
to help at this time?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
He urged the United Nations to "keep an open mind" instead of
acting upon pre-conceived ideas about the situation in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN-U.N. summit was held hours prior to the official
opening of the 10th session of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD X), which will last till February 19.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, UNCTAD Secretary-General
Rubens Ricupero as well as nine heads of state or government from
the 10 ASEAN members attended the summit.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian Finance Minister Quits Gold Mine Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian Finance Minister
Kwame Peprah resigned his position as Board Chairman of the
country's largest gold mine Ashanti Goldfields Company (AGC) under
managing pressures, the Ghana News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to the AGC Board, Peprah said, "due to
the pressures of implementing the challenging targets set out in
the country's year 2000 Budget, I find myself unable to
effectively continue as Chairman and Director of the Company. I am
 therefore tendering my resignation as Chairman and member of the
Board."
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian Government owns 20 percent share in the company,
which for many years was the largest foreign exchange earner for
the country.
</P>
<P>
AGC has been in deep trouble since last October when the
company's hedge book showed imminent bankruptcy and Lonmin also
attempted to merge with AGC on unfavorable terms.
</P>
<P>
Four shareholders took the company to court for gross
mismanagement and obtained a ruling asking for an Emergency
General Meeting (EGM) of shareholders to elect a new board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
Mines and Energy Minister John Abu told a press conference in
Accra on Thursday that government believes that Ashanti has a
bright future as an independent African gold mining company and
will take all necessary measures to ensure the rights of
shareholders, the safety and satisfactory returns on investments
made in Ghana.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany Call for Protecting European Film Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- France and Germany Saturday
called for the protection of European film production to alleviate
the domination by Hollywood films in European cinemas.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Culture Catherine Trautmann said at the 50th
Berlin Film Festival that France will launch a project on European
film production and distribution when Paris takes over the
rotating European Union (EU) presidency in the later half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany will set up a joint academy of
cinematography in the near future, announced the French and German
governments on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A fund will also be set up to support the presentation of five
French films in German cinemas and five German films in French
cinemas each year, according to Trautmann and her German
counterpart, Michael Naumann.
</P>
<P>
Trautmann said that in comparison with the United States,
Europe does not have sufficient means to produce and distribute
its films.
</P>
<P>
Both ministers regretted that Europeans are not showing enough
interests in their own film productions and have a feeling of "
cultural fatality" faced with domination of the Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
Although Europe has three major international film festivals --
Cannes, Venice and Berlin, American films are the blockbusters of
all seasons.
</P>
<P>
In a gesture to recognize French films, French comedian Jeanne
Moreau was presented Friday night by the organizers of the Berlin
Film Festival a golden bear, a symbol prize of the festival.
</P>
<P>
The 50th Berlin Film Festival, which opened Wednesday night,
will run for 12 days.

WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>

the Irish Republican Army.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Russian Proton Rocket Sends Indonesian Satellite Into Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A Russian Proton-K booster
rocket on Saturday sent an Indonesian communications satellite
into orbit from the Baikonur cosmodrome of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The 4.5-ton Garuda-1 satellite, manufactured by the U.S.
Lockheed Martin corporation and commissioned by Indonesia's Asia
Cellular Satellite company, will serve a mobile communications
system for the Asia Pacific region, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The launch was the first by a Proton rocket since Kazakhstan
lifted a ban in early February on the use of Proton rockets from
Baikonur.
</P>
<P>
Two Proton rocket boosters crashed last year, the last one on
October 27, 1999, prompting the Kazakh government to ban such
rockets.
</P>
<P>
Russia has since pinpointed the causes of the crashes and
successfully persuaded Kazakhstan to lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
Saturday marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of the
Baikonur cosmodrome, and the latest launch was the 1,146th from
there. Over the years, the former Soviet Union and Russia have
sent 1,181 spacecraft into space and conducted over 100
intercontinental ballistic missile tests.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- In a move to expand its
influence in China, Federal Express Corp. has nominated Shanghai
Da Tian International Transportation Co. Ltd. as its exclusive
agent in this commercial hub.
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Federal Express, the world's largest cargo
and mail delivery company, has announced it has terminated co-
operation with its three former agents in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
 Chen Jialiang, a senior official in charge of the company's
China and Pacific affairs, said that the narrowing down to one
agent will help Federal Express to better manage its operations in
the city and is in the best interests of its long-term investment
plan.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, the company's sustainable investment
scheme has been smoothly carried out, Chen told Xinhua in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
In mid-October, Federal Express launched its first website
using simplified Chinese characters, at site , on
which businesses and customers can track the status of their
orders.
</P>
<P>
On November 1, a joint venture between Federal Express and Da
Tian company officially went into operation in Beijing, and at the
same time Federal Express set up a quick delivery zone at the
Shenzhen Huangtian Airport in southern China.
</P>
<P>
The following day, Federal Express opened a route to the
airport, offering five flights a week and linking south China to
the company's service network covering 209 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
During the year, Federal Express also increased its flights
between Beijing and Shanghai from four to five a week.
</P>
<P>
Since Federal Express started operation in China in 1984, the
company has expanded its service to 144 cities here.
</P>
<P>
Da Tian, with branches in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Dalian,
Hong Kong and 11 other areas in China, is one of the first-class
international cargo transportation agent companies.

<HEADLINE> Monkeys Prefer Freedom to Cozy Living </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Eight rhesus monkeys who
escaped from their cages at Jianguo Park in Harbin have been
enjoying life on the run for most of the winter, and are evidently
reluctant to trade their freedom for indoor heating.
</P>
<P>
They fled last October when their keepers tried to move them
from their home on the chilly rocks of northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province into warmer, walled-in housing.
</P>
<P>
They quickly settled down in the woods in the eastern part of
the park, where they live a carefree life. Local citizens,
especially children, like to feed them and often gather to watch
them romp.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by the ongoing drop in already sub-zero temperatures,
the monkey keepers feared the animals would die of exposure, and
considered shooting the creatures with anesthetic darts and then
capturing them.
</P>
<P>
But they let well enough alone, as the monkeys apparently have
adjusted in the way that monkeys do: Their fur is growing longer,
they're gaining strength, and life in the open has given them new
vitality. One of the monkeys is four months' pregnant, and is
expected to give birth in March or April.
</P>
<P>
The rhesus, one of the species of the macaque, mainly live in
southwest China's Yunnan Province which has a mild climate. Rarely
do they adapt to the freezing temperatures of the northeastern
provinces, said Gao Zhongxin, zoologist in the Northeast China
Forestry University.

Beijing," an official from the municipal government said.
</P>
<P>
He added that many of Beijing's most important development
actions, like the construction of the Zhongguancun high-tech
region, are initially mentioned by the municipal congress deputies.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Begins Referendum On Draft Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabweans go to the polls
Saturday and Sunday in a historic referendum on the draft
constitution, the country's first plebiscite since independence in
1980.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations in Harare opened on Saturday morning for the
referendum on the draft constitution with steady streaming in of
voters.
</P>
<P>
The polling puts a cap on a process which began in April last
year with the appointment of a 400 strong Constitution Reform
Commission to seek people's views and draft a new constitution
</P>
<P>
All is set for voting, with 3,600 polling stations set up
countrywide.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Supervisory Commission has recruited 7,200
officers to monitor the process.
</P>
<P>
The major highlights of the draft are the distribution of power
among various arms of government, land redistribution, the
creation of an independent electoral commission, a Senate and
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed draft, executive power will be vested in the
elected president who will, however, share some of the powers with
the prime minister and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Campaigning for the draft constitution has intensified in the
past few weeks, with the Constitutional Commission embarking on a
media blitz, urging people to vote "yes".
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the draft have been urging people to vote against
it, saying it did not represent their views and vested too much
power in the president.
</P>
<P>
But the Constitutional Commission said the document is better
than the current compromise Lancaster House constitution as it
distributes power between the president, prime minister and the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe has urged people to vote "yes", saying
the document offers the black majority an opportunity to exercise
their sovereignty and speed up land reforms.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Says Namibia Ready to Negotiate With UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa said that
Namibia appeared to be willing to negotiate with the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) about the
conflict between the two parties in Namibia's northeastern
territories of Kavango and Caprivi.
</P>
<P>
Deputy minister of South Africa Defense Department Nozizwe
Madlala- Routledge revealed this on Saturday after returning from
Windhoek, capital of Namibia, on Friday after discussions with
Namibian authorities on the conflict along the Namibia-Angola
border.
</P>
<P>
She said: "I got the impression that the Namibian government
would be prepared to negotiate with UNITA, but they would have
difficulty negotiating with UNITA leader Savimbi."
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government last December allowed the Angolan
government troops to be deployed on its northeastern soil to
launch attacks against UNITA in southern Angola. In the latest
violence, 29 Namibian civilians have been reportedly massacred by
UNITA fighters.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma reacted by pledging his
continuous support for the Angolan government in its war against
UNITA, saying "Every Namibian must be ready to be called on to go
to Kavango and Caprivi to defend our citizens there."
</P>
<P>
Routledge said the situation in the area was "very tense",
leading to closure of some schools and tourist lodges.
</P>
<P>
But she also expressed optimism that peace could return to the
area, especially in view of Namibia's apparent willingness to
negotiate with UNITA.
</P>
<P>
"That is a positive step. It seems they are not totally ruling
out the approach of negotiation. We need to work together to
strengthen that approach."
</P>
<P>
Neither Namibia nor the countries in the region wanted a
protracted war.
</P>
<P>
"The violence that seems to be escalating makes it a matter of
priority that the Namibians find a solution together with the
member states of Southern African Development Community,"
Routledge said.

<HEADLINE> Somali Inter-Clan Fighting Kills 24 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Heavy inter-clan fighting in
the Somali border town of Dhobley has left 24 dead and at least 45
others wounded, witnesses said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting erupted between the Ogaden subclans of Mohamed
Subear and Awlyahan early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports reaching here, nearly 150 well-armed
fighters from the Awlyahan subclan attacked Dhobley town just
after mid-night targeting the key positions of the town.
</P>
<P>
The fighting which has been characterized as the most
catastrophic armed confrontation which ever took place inside
Dhobley town subsided in the afternoon as the Awlyahan fighters
were chased out.
</P>
<P>
The dominant Mohamed Subear fighters who now control the town
went after the retreating Awlyahan men about ten kilometers
northeast of the town towards the border with Kenya.
</P>
<P>
This fighting is said to have related to an earlier armed
confrontation which left 17 people dead and more than 25 others
wounded.
</P>
<P>
A businessman who asked not to be named said that the fighting
ten days ago broke out after each of the two sides killed two men
from the other side.
</P>
<P>
The Awlyahan fighters together with their civilians have been
driven out of the town in the subsequent fighting between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Elders from both sides and others in the area have tried to
broker for an official cessation of hostility, but had failed as
fighting broke out closing down all possible doors for
reconciliation at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
The latest reports from Dhobely indicate that the town is calm
on Saturday, but the situation around the whole area still remains
tense and volatile.
</P>
<P>
The defeated Awlyahan fighters are reportedly regrouping for
another trial of attack against the town as elders in the
neighboring district of Afmadow try for premature peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China-Russia Trade Grows Steadily (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Trade and economic cooperation
between China and Russia grew steadily last year, with China's
imports from Russia far exceeding its exports to the northern
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the General Administration of Customs show
that China imported 4.2 billion US dollars worth of goods from
Russia last year, up 14.5 percent from a year ago, and its exports
to Russia declined 18.5 percent to 1.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the overall trade volume between the two
countries reached 5.7 billion US dollars, up four percent. Russia
became China's 9th largest trading partner last year while China
was among the top ten trading partners of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the United States, and the European Union remained China
's three top trading partners in 1999. The other seven largest
trading partners were Hong Kong, the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, Australia,
Russia, and Canada.
</P>
<P>
A sluggish market demand in Russia was blamed as the main cause
of the decline of China's exports to Russia, according to trade
analysts.
</P>
<P>
But the strong market demand for raw materials in China
prompted a sharp rise of such imports as timber, rolled steel and
fertilizer from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the economic recovery since last July in Russia
has raised China's exports in the time since. China's export to
Russia is expected to show recovery this year, they predict.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China-Russia Trade Grows Steadily (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trade and economic cooperation is the most often discussed
topics between leaders of the two countries and their trade
officials. Russia's trade minister visited China early last year
while China's Premier Zhu Rongji signed 16 trade and economic
cooperation pacts in Moscow during his February visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
In June, a Chinese trade delegation visited the easternmost
part of Russia to promote trade relations between the neighboring
regions of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Before President Boris Yeltsin's final visit to Beijing last
December, China held a small company exhibition in Moscow last
October, and in the same month the two countries started
construction of their largest cooperative energy project, the
Lianyungang Nuclear Power Station in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
"China and Russia are highly complementary in their economies,
but the current level of trade and economic cooperation is far
from satisfactory in terms of the two countries' economic might,
development potential and expectations," said an official with the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
The official, who declined to be identified, said that China
and Russia should clear this hurdle and work to further promote
the growth of bilateral trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We can invest in each other's country, begin production in a
cooperative manner, and transfer technology in such areas as
energy, metallurgy, nuclear technology, electronics, forestry,
ship building, light industry, textile, foodstuffs and space
navigation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Fund Helps Hospitalized Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A special funding program
that pays children's hospital bills is now serving 2.2 million
local children in Shanghai, the largest city in China.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Children's Hospitalization Fund, which was set up
three years ago, has so far paid 140 million yuan for over 170,000
underage patients who were hospitalized for severe illness.
</P>
<P>
Only children who are Shanghai natives are eligible for the
money, and a 20 yuan registration fee is required. The fund pays
up to 80,000 yuan per child per year.
</P>
<P>
Often in China, money for medical bills of seriously ill
children is raised among relatives, friends or schoolmates.
</P>
<P>
So far, 95 percent of local children here have joined in the
program, but fund officials say they want to cover all the
underage kids in the city.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that some 1,000 children in Shanghai
contract fatal diseases like leukemia and cancer every year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Revenue Collections Exceed Target in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Saturday that it posted a better-than-expected revenue collection
of 36.2 billion pesos (900 million U.S. dollars) in January, a
good start for meeting its target for this year.
</P>
<P>
In a report published here, Commissioner Dakila Fonacier of the
Bureau of Internal Revenue said last month's revenue was 2.7
percent higher than its original goal of 35.2 billion pesos (870
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Fonacier expressed his hope that the upward trend in revenue
collection would continue, and the bureau would achieve its tax
goals in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
An early indicator of an improving economy, he noted, is the
upswing in imports, resulting in higher customs collection in the
month of January.
</P>
<P>
Fonacier said the bureau is tasked to collect 397.8 billion
pesos (about 10 billion dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the corresponding period of last year, last month
's collection marked a 20.31-percent increase, he said.

ISLAMABAD, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf said on Saturday that a revival of the
economy, improvement of national institutions and promotion of
unity among the provinces are the main priorities of the present
government.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of farmers, leaders and the elite of Dera

keeping in view his agenda of devolution of power, district-level
governments will be formed in the country this year and they will
be financially self supporting.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said reforms will also be brought in the judiciary so
that the poor could get speedy justice near their homes.
</P>
<P>
He said 15 Billion rupees (288.5 million U.S. dollars) had been
allocated recently for the poverty alleviation programs in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said a new strategy is being formulated to develop
agriculture, the backbone of the economy. The Export Promotion
Bureau is being reorganized to enhance export of farm produce and
other items, he added.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said that with the improvement in the marketing
system, Pakistan can earn 4 billion U.S. dollars from fish export
alone.

understanding of the dragon in Chinese culture, is aimed at
developing leadership skills and innovative potential and
facilitating exchange networks among Chinese youth all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the foundation, Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Tung Chee
Hwa said, "It is meaningful for the young people to get together
for interflow and exchanges which will help them have a better
understanding of the country and foster team spirit."

<P>
The Dragon Foundation plans to support and organize various
youth activities, including holding youth symposia, exchange
visits, research and cultural and musical events.
</P>

project, a Chinese youth-supporting project jointly organized by
the Hong Kong Committee of the "Dragon at the Great Wall" and the
All-China Youth Federation.
</P>
<P>
The "Dragon at the Great Wall" Organizing Committee on Saturday
also held an unveiling ceremony for the Dragon Portrait officiated
by Hong Kong Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung.
</P>
<P>
The unveiled Dragon Portrait, measuring 19" by 26", is composed
of 20 winning art pieces chosen from 28,000 entries drawn by youth
and then digitally merged.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the inauguration ceremony of the Dragon
Foundation, the "Dragon at the Great Wall" project also includes
the "Youth Conference on Meeting the Challenges of the New
Millennium" and the "Dragon Dance at the Great Wall" to be held in

<HEADLINE> 10,000 People to Demonstrate in Strasbourg to Back Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- About 10,000 people will
demonstrate on Saturday in the French city of Strasbourg on the
first anniversary of the arrest of Turkish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan, French police said.
</P>
<P>
The organizers of the demonstration call for the "
democratization" and the return to peace in Turkey, which is a
candidate for the European Union membership.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, who are mostly French but include many from
Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands, will force
traffic to a standstill in the main streets of Strasbourg, said
the police.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who is president of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers
Party (PKK), was arrested on February 16, 1999 in Kenya by the
Turkish security service.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was condemned to death on June 29 last year but his
execution was suspended this January by the Turkish government,
waiting for a decision by the Strasbourg-based European Court of
Human Rights on a complaint from Ocalan's lawyers against Ankara.

<HEADLINE> NBA All-Star Weekend Begins in Oakland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OAKLAND, California, February 11 (Xinhua) -- As expected, Karl'
s Malone table at today's media session was unoccupied. So were a
few others.
</P>
<P>
The reigning NBA Most Valuable Player and superstar forward of
the Utah Jazz repeatedly said this week that he was not coming to
the All-Star Game, despite being selected as a reserve on the
Western Conference squad.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Malone initially threatened to be a no-show if he
was left off the starting lineup, which is determined by fan
balloting. Minnesota's Kevin Garnett and San Antonio's Tim Duncan
were voted as starters by the fans.
</P>
<P>
This week, Malone cited a sore back for his reason not to
attend. He has received treatment on his back every off day this
season but has not missed any games due to the injury.
</P>
<P>
The league's stance is that players who are healthy enough to
play in regular-season games must play in the All-Star Game. The
NBA has threatened to
fine and suspend Malone without pay if he skips the midseason
showcase.
</P>
<P>
"You can look at a guy like him, he's definitely a great
player and he's been in this thing for many years," said Indiana
Pacers forward Dale Davis, who is playing in his first All-Star
Game. "He might be a little bit tired. Me personally, I haven't
experienced it yet and this is the ultimate experience for me, so
I wouldn't miss it."
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Malone chastised the league's younger
players for their lackadaisical approach to the game and me-first
attitude. Without naming names, he referred to them as "
knuckleheads."
</P>
<P>
"I'm not getting into any of that `knucklehead' stuff," long-
time Jazz teammate and fellow All-Star John Stockton said.
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's game in which he scored 30 points, Malone
said he was going home to his ranch in Arkansas. A Jazz spokesman
said he knew Malone would not be here today and does not expect
him to be at Saturday's mandatory practice. However, he believes
Malone will be at Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
Malone will be fined up to 10,000 U.S. dollars by the league
for missing today's media session and would also be fined should
he skip Saturday's practice.
</P>
<P>
Malone seems to be adopting a pattern of behavior similar to
Michael Jordan, a perennial All-Star who repeatedly skipped the
mandatory media session, sometimes to play a round of golf.
However, Jordan never threatened to skip the game.
</P>
<P>
Malone was not the only player to miss the media session --
just the only one without a legitimate excuse. Steady rain in the
Bay area prevented flights from landing at airports in San
Francisco and Oakland, causing five players to arrive late.
</P>
<P>
Duncan, David Robinson and Terry Porter of the Spurs were
stuck in San Antonio. Duncan and Robinson are on the Western
Conference All-Stars and Porter is in the Long Distance Shootout.
Rockets guard Steve Francis was delayed in Houston and Clippers
rookie Lamar Odom was stranded in Los Angeles. Both are playing in
the Rookie Challenge and Francis also is competing in 2ball and
the Slam Dunk Contest.
</P>
<P>
Kings second-year guard Jason Williams, who is playing in the
Rookie Challenge, drove from Sacramento and encountered traffic
problems. He arrived with about 10 minutes left in the media
session.
</P>
<P>
Williams' teammate Chris Webber, a forward on the Western
Conference All-Stars, supposedly was not as fortunate. A league
spokesman said it was unclear whether Webber had been caught in
traffic or simply had missed the session.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking into it," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Western Conference coach Phil Jackson of the Los Angeles
Lakers is the fourth coach to work the sidelines for both
conferences in an All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
While with the Chicago Bulls of the Eastern Conference,
Jackson lost the 1992 game in Orlando, Florida and won the 1996
contest in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
The other coaches to guide both conferences are Alex Hannum,
who coached the West in 1958 and the East in 1956 and 1968; Lenny
Wilkens, who coached the West in 1979 and 1980 and the East in
1989 and 1994; and Pat Riley, who coached the West in 1982-83 and
from 1985-90 and the East in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Conference coach Jeff Van Gundy of the New York Knicks
is just 38 years old and a scant two months older than Stockton, a
reserve guard for the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Stockton before," Van Gundy said. "I had never
met him and I long admired him. I know how bad I feel most
mornings getting up. How he can still go out there and play so
energetically. I don't think people have an appreciation for what
he's been able to accomplish. I know I feel bad and I don't get
run over by 280-pound guys every night. He's really an amazing guy.
"
</P>
<P>
With his 10th selection, Stockton became the second-oldest All-
Star in NBA history. At 37 years, 10 months, he is slightly older
than former Boston Celtics greats John Havlicek and Bill Russell,
who also were chosen as 37-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
"I don't stop and think of my age often," said Stockton, the
NBA's all-time leader in assists and steals. "It probably does
work for me in a whole lot of ways if I stop and think about it."
</P>
<P>
The oldest All-Star was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who was 41 years,
9 months when he was tabbed in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Davis is one month shy of his 31st birthday, which makes him
the sixth-oldest first-time All-Star in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
"You calling me old or what?" joked Davis. "I've been trying
to get on the team, been playing my tail off and hadn't quite
gotten there. Usually you don't get anywhere in life if you don't
keep at it."
</P>
<P>
The only power forward selected for the Eastern Conference,
Davis is averaging 11.2 points and is seventh in the NBA with 10.1
rebounds per game. His emergence this season was a direct result
of increased playing time following the trade of forward-center
Antonio Davis to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
"We would love to still have Antonio," Dale Davis said "By him
leaving, I had to take upon a bigger responsibility. I knew I'd be
asked to do more. The opportunity was definitely there and I
cashed in on it."
</P>
<P>
Twelve players have made their first All-Star Games as 30
something, including current players Charles Oakley (1994), Detlef
Schrempf (1993) and Rik Smits (1998), Davis' teammate on the
Pacers.
</P>
<P>
The oldest first-time All-Star was Nat "Sweetwater" Clifton of
the New York Knicks, who was selected for the 1957 game at 34
years young.

<HEADLINE> Israel Has to Ensure Northern Security: Levy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli government has to
take measures to ensure the security of its northern residents who
are facing possible Hezbollah attacks, Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy has said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel will hit the Hezbollah harder if it launches
rocket attacks against northern Israel which would harm the
northern residents, Levy said in a letter he sent Friday to
Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, Israel Radio
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Levy explained in detail about why Israel struck
several civilain targets, such as power stations in Lebanon and the
reasons behind Israel's constant air strikes against the Hezbollah
targets in south Lebanon, the Radio added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also urged Annan to use his good office to
ask Syria to rein in the Hezbollah to stop military operations
inside the security zone in order to prevent the situation in south
Lebanon from further worsening.
</P>
<P>
The situation in south Lebanon has worsened over the last few
days as Hezbollah and the Israel Defence Force (IDF) inside the
security zone exchanged attacks on each other.
</P>
<P>
Seven IDF soldiers have been killed since the beginning of this
year inside the security zone, which Israel set up in 1985 with the
self-proclaimed purpose of protecting its northern residents.

<P>
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since
spearheading a guerrilla war to try and oust the Israeli occupation
troops and their proxy South Lebanon Army out of the country.

Israeli warplanes struck on Saturday some suspected Hezbollah
targets in the eastern sector of the security zone after the IDF
outposts have been reportedly attacked by Hezbollah, the Radio

</P>
<P>
But there were no reports of casualties in the latest fighting.
</P>
<P>
Life has returned to normal in northern Israel since Friday as
the state of emergency was lifted by the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Local residents came out from security zones or bomb shelters
after three nights, but many of them are still concerned about
Hezbollah rocket attacks.

<P>
COLOMBO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's trade deficit in
1999 expanded to 1.294 billion U.S. dollars, an 18.55-percent
increase over the previous year, the Central Bank said Saturday.
</P>
<P>

The value of exports totaled some 4.6 billion dollars in 1999,
down 4.1 percent from 4.798 billion dollars in 1998.

He decried arm-chair leadership saying the country would not
register any success in the agriculture sector if deliberate
efforts were not taken.
</P>
<P>
According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
latest food supply situation report, due to erratic rains, reduced

Of the 88.6 million hectares of arable land in the country,
only about half is currently being exploited, leaving millions of
Tanzanians in a constant state of hunger.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Chirac to Address Burundi Peace Talks Via Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton and French President Jacques Chirac will deliver video
address to the new round of Burundi peace talks aimed at ending
the country's six-year civil war, Tanzania's Guardian newspaper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders invited to attend the peace talks by former
South African president Nelson Mandela will talk with 18 Burundi
faction leaders via satellite link, the head of the mediation team
Judge Mark Bomani told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Chirac are expected to persuade the warring parties
to bring their hostilities to an end when the peace talks begin in
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha in a week's time, Bomani said.
</P>
<P>
Other leaders invited to the talks are South African President
Thabo Mbeki, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasanjo and all heads of state of the Great
Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Secretary General Koffi Annan and the
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity Salim Ahmed
Salim have also been invited to attend the talks, said Bomani.
</P>
<P>
According to Bomani, the participation of an armed rebel group,
the Force for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD), which has never
taken part in the peace negotiations, will depend on the outcome
of their talks with Mandela, the newly appointed mediator to
Burundi peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 people have been killed since the outbreak of war
in 1993 between the Hutu rebels and the army, dominated by the
minority Tutsi ethnic group in the tiny central African nation.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks which began in Arusha in June 1998 made little
progress until the death of the original mediator, Tanzania's
first president Julius Nyerere last October.

LAGOS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria federal government has
removed all duties and taxes, including the value added tax, on
agricultural products of the country, Punchu newspaper reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Information Minister Dapo Sarumi in Abuja as
saying on Friday that the measure was taken to demonstrate
government's determination in the total deregulation of the
agricultural sector of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Sarumi said the federal government would no longer be involved
in the importation of agricultural products, including the import
and distribution of fertilizer in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The government expects that the private sector will take
opportunity of this concession to import agricultural products,"
he said, adding the removal would help flood the market with
needed agricultural inputs.
</P>
<P>
The decision to deregulate the agricultural sector was
expected to reduce the prices of food and agricultural products of

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Controls 11 Congo Airstrips: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan government troops
have controlled 11 airstrips in the eastern parts of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to try to cut the rebels'
supply lines.
</P>
<P>
The control of the airstrips is in line with the broader
strategic objective of denying the enemy supplies necessary to
launch big offensives, the Saturday's Monitor daily quoted
Ugandan People's Defense Forces (UPDF) Spokesman Shaban Bantariza
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The officer said that the rebels of the Allied Democratic
Forces (ADF) fighting the Ugandan government had used the
airstrips to get logistic supplies from Sudan and DRC
governments.
</P>
<P>
He also said that UPDF's presence in eastern DRC is to stop,
for once and all, more rebel activities in western Uganda. The
rebels have been causing havoc in the region since late last year,
killing dozens of innocent people and displacing many others.
</P>
<P>
UPDF deployed in western Uganda would continue to pursue the
ADF rebels whose hideouts are suspected to be in the vast
Rwenzori mountains, he added.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the civil war broke out in the DRC in early August
of 1998, Uganda sent troops into the big central African country
to allegedly stop rebel activities and possible genocide. Kinshasa
has been accusing Kampala of invading DRC, a charge categorically
denied by Ugandan authorities.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Denies Involvement in DRC Tribal Strife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan government forces
have denied any involvement in the tribal strife in the eastern
parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which has
reportedly killed thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
"We have not directly or indirectly been involved in the
fighting between the Hema and Lendu tribes. We just maintain our
positions there," Barigye Bahoku, press assistant to State
Minister of Defense Steven Kavuma, told Xinhua Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"But our forces may have tried to separate the two fighting
tribes because one of our goals there is to stop genocide," he
said.
</P>
<P>
A human rights group in the DRC has accused Ugandan soldiers
of siding with the Hema ethnic group, which since last June has
been involved in an escalating conflict over land rights with its
Lendu neighbors.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the report of Kabila forces' recapture of
three towns in eastern DRC, Bahoku said that it was a clear and
brutal violation of the Lusaka agreement and Ugandan People's
Defense Forces would surely fight back if attacked.
</P>
<P>
He said Uganda would continue to honor the peace accord and
try to bring everlasting peace to the DRC.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The first Euro-African condom
 manufacturing venture in Africa will be under construction in the
Kenyan capital Nairobi in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
The letter of intent to form the join-venture, to be known as
Condomi Health Kenya, was signed Friday by Olago Enterprises
Kenya and Condomi AG Germany with each company sharing 50 percent
of shares, local media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The total investment will amount to 2.5 million U.S. dollars
and initial capacity will stand at 100 million condoms a year.
</P>
<P>
The project will be financed by the German Development Bank
within the framework of the Public and Private Partnership.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Managing director of Olago
Enterprises Kenya Ochieng Mbeo said that the market demand for
condoms in Kenya has increased by over 250 percent in the past
three years due to changed attitudes towards HIV/AIDS prevention.
</P>
<P>
Local and international experts predict that the demand of
condoms in the east African country will amount to 650 million
pieces by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The current demand is put at 120 million condoms a year.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the joint-venture has been hailed by local
media as a bold step in containing AIDS in Kenya, where the
killer epidemic claims 500 lives a day.

<HEADLINE> Hackers Use California Varsity Computer in Attacking CNN Website </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The University of
California at Santa Barbara confirmed Friday that one of their
computers was used to rock CNN's Website, one of the major sites
that suffered "denial of service" attacks earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The desktop computer in a research lab was electronically
broken into by a computer hacker sometime before Tuesday night
when the traces of the attack were first noticed by a campus
network programmer. "There is no indication that the attack came
from anyone in the university," the university said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
A half-dozen of the largest e-commerce and portal sites were
blacked out this week by unknown hackers, drawing international
attention. The hackers used a method called "distributed denial of
service" attacks, which involve sending extremely large amount of
traffic at a Web site and making it inaccessible to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
To mount such a huge attack, hundreds or even thousands of
other computers were likely to be co-opted as unwilling
participants, and the university's computers appear to have been
among the machines used in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Some experts have speculated since this week's attacks that
systems at many universities or hospitals, which have high-speed
connections to the Internet but relatively low security, could
have been used as "unwilling agents."
</P>
<P>
The University of California at San Barbara is a leader in
computer science in the United States. Speaking of the hackers,
the university said in a statement that "they have attacked us in
a way that hurts what we do as a university, and hurts all other
universities."

<HEADLINE> Increasing Number of Ethnic Minorities Live in Urban Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- China has witnessed major
changes in the distribution of the ethnic minorities in recent
years, with more and more of them choosing towns and cities to
live and work.
</P>
<P>
At present, most of them are living in ethnic minority
autonomous areas, including five provincial-level regions, 30
prefectures and 120 counties, as well as 1,200 towns.
</P>
<P>
In cities in other places of the country, the State Ethnic
Affairs Commission estimated that the people of ethnic minority
groups accounted for 20 percent of the total ethnic minority
population by the year of 1997, compared with 8.35 percent in 1982.
</P>
<P>
With China's rapid economic development, more and more ethnic
minorities have turned to towns and cities for more job
opportunities and better living conditions. An increasing number
of them move to big cities in the economically developed eastern
part of the country.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Drops to Single Digit in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The inflation rate in the
first five months of the current fiscal year (1999/2000)
registered a sharp drop to a single digit in Nepal, according to
the country's central bank, Nepal Rastra Bank said in a communique
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The communique on the country's macroeconomic situation said
the inflation rate on a point-to-point basis was recorded at 1.8
percent during the review period compared with 19.2 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
The national price index dropped to a record low due to the
decelerating trend in the prices of food and beverages group,
which increased nominally by 0.1 percent in the review period as
compared with a significant increase of 27.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The declining trend in the prices of oil and ghee, vegetables
and fruits, pulses, sugar and related products and spices is
attributed to the nominal growth in the price index of food and
beverages.
</P>
<P>
However, the prices of non-food products and services moved up
by 5.4 percent, against 4.6 percent a year ago, according to the
communique.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government raised the prices of petroleum products
by 35 percent and electricity by 30 percent in the early stage of
the current fiscal year which began in July 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister for Public
Health Sam Ongeri has said that the decision by AIDS victims to
go public over their HIV status was voluntary.
</P>
<P>
Ongeri was quoted by the East African Standard newspaper on

employment policies of other government departments and private
companies.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS/HIV victims should be integrated in all social
activities and be assisted by the community instead of being
discriminated against, the minister said Friday.

The remarks followed a demand by the Teachers Service
Commission, the employer of the public school staff, for a list
of teachers suffering from AIDS.

<P>
Early this month the commission instructed all district and
municipal education officers to compile and submit a list of all

Kenya National Union of Teachers threatened a nationwide strike,
saying that the order was against the protection of privacy .

</P>
<P>
Ahn was vice information and communications minister and Choi

BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- China's leading national
newspaper, the People's Daily, today called on the whole Chinese
society to care and support the country's education.
</P>
<P>
In a first-page commentary, the paper said that it is a issue
of major significance to help and guide the country's youngsters
and students to grow in a correct orientation and develop in an
all-round way.
</P>
<P>
At present, it noted, about one-fifth of China's total
population, or 240 million people, are receiving education from
various forms.
</P>
<P>
"They constitute a strong reserve force for the country's
socialist modernization drive and they need special care, support

</P>
<P>
As a lofty cause of social welfare, education is also a huge
project of great complexity. Schools as well as the whole society
should do their part in improving and enhancing education, it said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Openness Good For Economic Growth: Economist at Bangkok Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Openness and non-
discrimination should remain watchwords in the area of
international trade, an economist said here Saturday at a high-
level round table meeting attended by world eminent economists.
</P>
<P>
L. Alan Winters, an eminent economist from the University of
Sussex, the United Kingdom, said that "openness and non-
discrimination should remain our watchwords."
</P>
<P>
Alan believed that openness and non-discrimination reduce the
opportunities for discretionary policy.
</P>
<P>
he said openness offers a way of conserving skilled labor for
the many other challenges of development, such as education and
efficient administration.
</P>
<P>
he argued that countries should embrace vigorous trade
liberalization packages albeit with suitable transitional periods.
</P>
<P>
On Trade policy, he said, "trade policy should address barriers,
such as poor customs formalities, infrastructure and tariffs."
</P>
<P>
Alan insisted that liberalization should be multilateral and
not regional in nature.
</P>
<P>
He called the United nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) to devise and produce effective measures of
trade regimes for the next decade.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Trade Deficit Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's trade deficit
widened significantly during the first five months of the current
fiscal year (1999/2000) despite a rise in exports and imports,
according to a communique on macro-economic situation issued
Friday by the country's central bank -- Nepal Rastra Bank.
</P>
<P>
Although exports registered an impressive growth, trade deficit
increased by 38.5 percent to 22,668.2 million rupees (323.7
million U.S.dollars) due to high volume of imports as against
exports, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Exports and imports registered a growth of 37.8 percent and 38.
2 percent to 19,040.9 million rupees (272 million dollars) and 49,
709.1 million rupees (710 million dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
The surge in total imports is attributed to the growth of
imports of foodgrain, medicine, cement, textile, thread and glass
from India and gold, raw wool, cotton, spare parts, construction
material and steel sheet from third countries.
</P>
<P>
On the export front, ready-made garment, carpet and jewelry
have registered a growing trend. Export is one of the major
foreign currency earners for Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the trade deficit outpacing the increase in net
service as well as transfer income has resulted in the current
account deficit of 1,376.2 million rupees (19.7 million dollars),
though an increase in the official capital inflow and
miscellaneous capital items have helped balance of payment to a
sizable surplus of 3,218.7 million rupees (46 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Economic Slowdown Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of Pakistan (
SBP) has announced that economic slowdown which began last year
continues during the current financial year.
</P>
<P>
A report of the second quarter of the fiscal year 1999-2000
released by the SBP on Friday depicts persistent structural
problems, increase in trade deficit, slowdown in monetary
expansion, credit to the private sector, and higher outflows of
capital.
</P>
<P>
The report said there are no signs of improvement in private
investments, and public investment is also constrained by
budgetary considerations. It said that trade deficit will exceed
the target for the year due to larger than expected imports.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that there is some hope expected from
the economic revival plan announced by the government and tax
revenues are also expected to increase.
</P>
<P>
The SBP said that after taking over power in the country, the
present regime reaffirmed its priorities by announcing an economic
revival package in December 1999. The package clearly sets the
directions in which the economy would move, but some specific
actions to implement the package are underway, while others would
be detailed in the next year's budget.

<HEADLINE> hke021211-- Indonesian Army Unit Pledges to be Loyal to Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Amid mounting pressure on Gen.
Wiranto to resign, Chief of the Indonesian Army's Strategic
Reserve Command (Kostrad) Let. Gen. Djaja Suparman asserted on
Friday that the Kostrad remains loyal to the President Abdurrahman
Wahid administration.
</P>
<P>
It is the obligation and duty of the Kostrad to be in obedience
to and escort the legitimated government which has been
established through a constitutional way and based on laws.
</P>
<P>
"The Kostrad has the duty to be loyal to the legitimated
government. The Kostrad brass also will not involve in politics (
practices)," Suparman said.
</P>
<P>
Suparman's statement has deleted doubts that the army's unit is
not loyal to the president.
</P>
<P>
Suparman's statement is also part of the military attempts to
ensure the government that the Indonesian Military (TNI) is behind
the Wahid's administration after the TNI chief Adm. Widodo
asserted earlier that there are no reasons for the TNI not to
support the legitimated government under President Abdurrahman
Wahid.
</P>
<P>
"There are no reasons for TNI not to support the government
which has been elected through a democratic process," Widodo said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, powerful Army Chief of Staff Gen. Tyasno Sudarto
said that it is better for Wiranto to resign from his cabinet post
and follow President Wahid's request.
</P>
<P>
"As I have said that the president has a prerogative right
based on constitution and laws to pick and sack his men, namely
his ministers," Sudarto said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Suparman also lambasted rumors saying that the
Kostrad would launch a military coup against President Wahid.
</P>
<P>
Over past six months since a U.N.-sponsored direct ballot in
East Timor in August last year, under which the territory voted in
favor of independence and separated from the unitary state of
Indonesia, the TNI has been highlighted by many parties both
domestic and overseas for its involvement in human right abuse in
the breakaway province of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, The National Commission on Human Right (Komnas HAM)
issued a report, confirming the TNI's involvement in human right
violations in the territory, leaving death of thousands of East
Timorese.
</P>
<P>
The commission also accused former TNI Chief Gen. Wiranto, who
is also coordinating minister for Politics and Security Affairs,
as the most responsible one for what it said a crime against
humanity in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The report was hailed by many parties which urged Wiranto to
leave his cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid also persistently suggested Wiranto to do so
for his interest and the good of the TNI.
</P>
<P>
But Wiranto has insisted that he will not step down unless the
court finds him guilty.

BERLIN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Austrian President Thomas
Klestil arrived in Munich Friday to start a formal visit to
Germany's Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
Bavaria's Minister-President Edmund Stoiber met Klestil upon
his arrival, focusing their talks on the European Union's plan to
impose sanctions on Austria.
</P>
<P>
Stoiber stressed that Bavaria would strengthen cooperation with
Austria and said the EU's sanctions will be an "overreaction,"
because one should judge a government by not only what it says,
but also what it does.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Stoiber, also chairman of the Germany's
Christian Social Union, said that he believes Austria's policy
would conform to the common European basic rule under the
leadership of Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel.
</P>
<P>
Bavaria has close relations with Austria. Since the new
Austrian center-right government was formed, EU member countries
including Germany have kept a distance from it, but Bavaria's
government has different stances with Germany's federal government
by expressing hope to strengthen bilateral ties with Austria.

CANBERRA -- Widespread take-up of e-commerce could add 2.7

a new report said on Friday.

Research by the National Office for the Information Economy (
NOIE) into the economic impacts of electronic commerce found that
while it would not boost all industries, the benefits would exceed
the costs.

<P>
"The SPDC laid down the national policy or national belief or

Spirit," he said.
</P>
<P>
The national policy is: non-disintegration of the union, non-

<HEADLINE> hke021207 --Japanese Economist on Regional Group's Rule in Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Regional cooperation groups
like the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) can offer help
to individual developing countries in meeting the challenge of
globalization, Japanese economist Ippei Yamazawa said at a
roundtable meeting held here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries need technical assistance for
liberalization and facilitation, strengthening individual
financial systems, and moral support or joint commitment for
pursuing structural reform from regional groups, Yamazawa from
Japan's Hitotsubashi University said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that these measures are already being implemented
through APEC.
</P>
<P>
Yamazawa said globalization is inevitably accompanied by global
constraints and amplified disturbances in factor supply and
movements, to which developing economies are particularly
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in 1997 was viewed by the Japanese
economist as "a failed response to globalization," caused by
volatile capital flows, deficient economic structures and weak
financial regimes.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the recurrence of the crisis, Yamazawa offered a
three-tier prescription for the developing countries, especially
in the Asia-Pacific region, namely the national, regional and
global levels.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the regional level, deliberate control of volatile
capital movements at the global level is also needed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, at the national level, structural deficiencies
need to be corrected, financial systems strengthened and
governance of business firms be improved.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese economist made the remark at a High-level
Roundtable on Trade and Development, held here Saturday prior to
the official opening of the 10th Session of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X).

<HEADLINE> China Takes Move to Protect Coastline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A national investigation into
illegal removal of sand along China's coastline has been
successful, the English-language newspaper China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The move to protect the coastline has curbed the illegal
activity and educated the public about the damage it does to the
country's environment.
</P>
<P>
"Many people who live along the seashore voluntarily quit
illegally digging-up sand on the seashore once they learn that it
was against the law to do so," said an official of the Law
Enforcement Division of the China Sea Supervision Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, sea sand became especially profitable in
China due to the growing infrastructure construction. Also, a
shortage of sand from rivers made people illegally remove sand
from the seashore.
</P>
<P>
However, laws have been in place to stop this from occurring,
although it still goes on.
</P>
<P>
"Ignorance of legal and environmental responsibilities is one
major reason for our country's excessive illegal digging up of
sand," the official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The investigation covered the country's three million square
kilometers of offshore areas. It was started around the mid-
January and is expected to end soon.

VIENNA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Austrian former Chancellor
Viktor Klima has said that he will withdraw from the National
Council and will not take the position of the leader of the Social
Democratic Party's Parliamentary Group, the Austrian magazine
Format Weekly said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Klima, also chairman of the democratic party, told the weekly
that if he continues to be the party chairman, his goal is to seek
younger persons for the government.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic Party had led the Austrian government in
the past 30 years. Klima became the chancellor and the party
chairman in 1996 to replace Franz Vranitzky.
In the general elections last October, the party lost many voters,
but remained the biggest party. Klima failed to form a new
Austrian government twice since the Freedom Party and the People's
Party refused to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
According to sources of the party, Vienna Mayor Michael Haeupl,
Caspar Einem, former minister of communications, scientific
research and arts, former Interior Minister Karl Schloegl and
President of the National Council Heinz Fischer are the possible
candidates to replace Klima as the chairman of the democratic
party.

<HEADLINE> Kyrgyzstan Ready to Beat Back Invasion of Terrorists: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ALTA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kyrgyz armed forces are
ready to block invasion of any illegal armed gangs and determined
to crack down on terrorism, Kyrgyz National Security Council
Chairman Bolot Dzhanuzakov said in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dzhanuzakov, quoted by the Interfax news service, said that a
group of some 700 illegal armed bandits are currently gathering
near the Kyrgyz border with its neighboring Central Asian nation
of Tajikistan, posing a serious threat to Kyrgyzstan's national
security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan has taken a series of measures to strengthen control
over its border areas, including setting up new posts,
establishing a new army group in its southern area and increasing
technological equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the tiny land-locked former Soviet republic also
begun cooperation with members of the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) and other countries in fighting terrorism, he added.
</P>
<P>
Dzhanuzakov stressed that any attempt to foment ethnic
separation and religious confrontation are not allowed in
Kyrgyzstan and "all Islamic extremists will be eliminated."
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyz will try its best to prevent the recurrence of the
hostage-taking incident in August last year and "illegal armed
gangs will never gain a passage corridor on the Kyrgyz territory,"
he warned.
</P>
<P>
Last August, a large number of militants from Tajikistan
crossed into the southern part of Kyrgyzstan and took several
officials and Japanese mining experts hostage. They also seized
several Kyrgyz villages and were believed to try to infiltrate
into Kyrgyzstan's western neighbor Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyz official sources said Tajik Islamic militants will
probably launch similar operations in southern Kyrgyzstan this
spring.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Increase Import of Integrated Circuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The rapid development of the
information industry in China will necessitate more integrated
circuit (IC) and micro-electronic products from the international
market, according to a source with Beijing customs.
</P>
<P>
Last year the customs recorded imports of 270 million IC
products, up 86 percent from 1998. The rise can be attributed to
the boom in sales of computers and other digital products, said
customs officials.
</P>
<P>
China needs about 100 billion IC products this year, most of
which will have to be imported, the source predicted.
</P>
<P>
The two main providers of IC products are Finland and Japan,
which sold 310 million and 62 million US dollars of products to
China respectively. The IC digital chip products accounted for
about 66 percent of the imports, said the customs.

BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The State Press and
Publication Administration is to encourage the development of

today.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Many Chinese Wish for Cash, Good Health in New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Many Chinese are hoping that
in the lunar new year of the dragon they could make more money and
keep good health, the English-language newspaper China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the Beijing-based China Mainland
Marketing Research Co. indicated that nearly 31 percent of the
respondents are crossing their fingers for more income and a
better life in the new year.
</P>
<P>
The 14-city, 6,400-sample survey also found that 15 percent
hoped to do better in their careers or at school, with the same
number wishing for safety and health.
</P>
<P>
"The wishes actually reflect the great changes that have taken
place in the public's life," Zhou Jiang, the company's general
manager, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The pursuit of wealth was regarded as "capitalist mentality"
during the havoc of the "cultural revolution" (1966-76). Efforts
for better careers were also despised at the time as the entire
nation plunged fervently into politics.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, an affluent life is a goal the general public is
going after now," Zhou said. "And the pursuit of such a life
encourages them to take an active role in the nation's development.
"
</P>
<P>
Other entries on the list of the new year wishes include the
prosperity of the nation, the purchase of houses, computers and
cars, and new employment.
</P>
<P>
Noticeably, nearly two percent of the respondents in Beijing
and more than one percent in the northwestern city of Lanzhou said
the control of pollution in their cities was their biggest wish in
the new year.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government will
support oil market stabilization because too high oil prices cause
damage to both consumers and producers, said Energy Vice-minister
for Policy and Energy Development Jorge Chavez Presa on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The present increase in oil price is caused by speculation. "
The present levels or the rises that have occurred have been
caused by sporadic, seasonal reasons, by too cold temperatures,
and some times, it has been the declarations what have caused
rises in oil prices", said Chavez Presa.
</P>
<P>
The price of the Mexican mix for export registered a new record
Thursday by going up to 24.93 dollars per barrel, while the West
Texas Intermediate closed at 29.43 dollars per barrel and the
North Sea Brent Crude was sold at 27.48 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Chavez Presa said after presenting an energy-saving program
that "any aspects or any sudden movement of the oil prices is not
good either for the consumers or for the producers."
</P>
<P>
Chavez said that Mexico is also a good consumer of oil and that
the rise in oil price is immediately reflected in the costs of the
production sector.

<P>
XI'AN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Physicians at Xijing Hospital in
Xi'an, the capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, have
successfully killed cancer cells by employing a "freezing
technique".
</P>
<P>
A liver cancer patient suffered from a relapse after a surgical
operation. Doctors at the hospital said a second operation would
severely impair the patient's liver. Doctors at the hospital
decided as a last resort to undertake the unusual operation.
</P>
<P>
Doctors inserted a superconductive knife, two millimeters in
diameter, into the tumor emitting high-pressure argon and helium
through the knife point. In 60 seconds, the tumor became an ice
ball. The temperature dropped to -140 degrees Celsius below zero.
All cancer cells were killed.
</P>
<P>
The operation took only 30 minutes. The patient felt no pain
and there was no bleeding. He was discharged from the hospital
three days later.
</P>
<P>
"The therapy is a breakthrough in cancer treatment," said Dou
Kefeng, a surgeon in charge of the operation.

<HEADLINE> Arab Parliamentary Union Slams Israeli Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Ahmed Fathi Sorour, chairman of
the Arab Parliamentary Union (APU), on Saturday issued a statement
saying Israeli attacks in Lebanon "has dealt the peace process a
fatal blow."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli "aggression could torpedo the whole process and end
it for good," said Sorour, who is Egypt's parliament speaker.
</P>
<P>
"The aggression has torn all masks off the real face of Israel,
stripped it of all credibility and explicitly exposed its hostility
to peace and its dues," said sorour, quoted by the Middle East News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes launched air raids against Lebanese
infrastructure and suspected Hezbollah positions, in retaliation
for guerrilla attacks that killed seven Israeli soldiers in the
past weeks.
</P>
<P>
Sorour urged all arab leaders and governments to surmount their
cliches of condemnation and denouncements, declare practical
solidarity with Lebanon in its struggle against Israeli attacks and
offer all forms of support to help the Lebanese people.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel will certainly be disillusioned when it
finds out that such an aggression will not stop nor intimidate the
Lebanese "courageous" resistance which is blessed by all the
Lebanese people.
</P>
<P>
He called on world parliaments to urge their governments take
deterrent steps that would force the Israeli leadership to stop
their attacks against Lebanon and to completely and unconditionally
pull out from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a border strip in south Lebanon as so-called
security zone in 1985, with the declared aim of protecting its
north from guerrilla attacks.

and undifferentiated state is the aim of two research projects now
setting out at the university of Pavia near Milan.
</P>
<P>
According to two of the biologists involved in the project,
Carlo Alberto Redi and Maurizio Zuccotti, once they have found the
secret, they should be able to reprogram the cell with the
appropriate commands so that it develops into a cell of a
different type.
</P>
<P>
In the example they gave to a conference on the medicine of
reproduction going on here, they said they hoped to be able to
replace blood cells hit by a tumor with new blood cells obtained
by re-programming cells of another type.
</P>
<P>
"Another possibility would be to obtain simple tissues like
skin," said Zuccotti. "Even though it may be far off in time, it
is no longer simple sci-fi to imagine re-programming cells to
produce organs for transplants."
</P>
<P>
Zuccotti, who teaches at Parma University, but also works on
the time machine for cells at Pavia University's biology of
development lab, returned to Italy after spending two years at
Hawaii University working with Ryuzo Yanagimachi, the biologist
who cloned a rat in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The dream of an embryologist," said Redi and Zuccotti, "is to
take somatic cells, de-differentiate them and then re-
differentiate so they have different functions."
</P>
<P>
The cells that organisms are born from and with, split into new
forms, thus differentiating their functions. In the end, they
build up all the many cell forms and functions in the soma, the
organism's body.
</P>
<P>
If Redi and Zuccotti's research is successful, they would be
able to control this process backwards and forwards in time.
</P>
<P>
"The true aim is to accumulate scientific data so that therapy
can be transformed," said the two researchers, who also reported
that the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Japan
are investing colossal sums in cell re-programming.
</P>
<P>
"In the next 10-15 years, so much progress can be expected that
what now seem to be distant possibilities will become reality,"
they forecast.
</P>
<P>
For their own research, the funding has come from private
sources. The Cariplo Foundation for science has supplied 135,000 U.
S. dollars, and the Telethon fund 95,000 U.S. dollars, to be spent
over two years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pilots Refusing Vaccine Barred from Training Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the 122nd Fighter Wing, which is scheduled to be
sent to the Middle East in April, have to start the series of six
shots. The vaccination program had been voluntary until now.
</P>
<P>
The Indiana Air National Guard said those who refuse to take
the vaccine by Sunday's deadline will be disobeying a written
order and could face additional penalties, including discharge.
</P>
<P>
Some of the pilots who were barred from flying for the Guard in
January for refusing the vaccine, said that there hasn't been
enough research to prove that the vaccine is safe.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Department has ordered all of its 2.4 million
active and reserve personnel be inoculated against anthrax, a
deadly germ that can be used in biological warfare.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 200 to 300 people have refused the vaccine.
Several men and women have been prosecuted, and many reservists
have quit because of the shots.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Peasants Block Road </HEADLINE>

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of
Colombian peasants blocked Saturday the road from Medellin to the
Atlantic coast, protesting against the demilitarization of five
municipalities in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
Regional police said that the peasant closed the road at the
Taraza municipality, stopping the traffic of cargo trucks and
passenger buses.
</P>
<P>
This is the second case of a closing of roads that communicate
the interior of Colombia with the Caribbean coast. The isolation
has caused a scarcity of the main agricultural products in the
markets of the cities of the region.
</P>
<P>
The southern zone of the Bolivar department has been the site
of several confrontations between the rebel National Liberation
Army (ELN) and the rightist paramilitary group of United Self-
Defenses of Colombia (AUC) vying for the control of the territory.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrana called Saturday morning to an extraordinary
meeting of the National Security Council to discuss the
deteriorated public order in the country.
</P>
<P>
Three main themes are being discussed in the National Security
Council, made up of the Foreign, Defense and Interior ministers,
as well as high ranking military and police officers.
</P>
<P>
The first theme relates to the blockade of four main roads in
the nation, especially the Medellin-Bogota road, obstructed by the
National Liberation Army (ELN), the second guerrilla force in the
country that has affected public order and the transportation of
passengers.
</P>
<P>
The second theme refers to the ELN attacks against energy
towers in several departments, causing the rationing of electric
power.
</P>
<P>
The third is about the mutiny in the La Picota prison in the
Colombian capital, caused by the entering and seizing of weapons
in the penitentiary center.
</P>
<P>
A series of measures aimed at controlling and maintaining
public order in the country will be announced by Interior Minister
Nestor Humberto Martinez and the end of the meeting, said official
sources.

<HEADLINE> Bolivia Willing to Be a Mercosur Full Member </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proposal for the definitive inclusion of Bolivia and Chile
in Mercosur, a market of which both countries are only associate
partners, was made Friday by the Bolivian government, according to
Saavedra.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur has four formal members including Argentine, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
However, the authority said that a possible admission in
Mercosur must be the result of a consultation with the productive
sectors of the country, but also with the condition that Bolivia
will be permitted to maintain its association with the CAN, formed
by Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Venezuela, because 50 percent of
the Bolivian exports go to that market.
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia proposal
implies, in Saavedra's opinion, to make "an exception" in the
Mercosur regulations to permit Bolivia be part of the two South
American regional markets.
</P>
<P>
"We have understood in this sense the statements of Minister
Lampreia," said Saavedra, adding that otherwise, if one or the
other bloc has to be chosen, "we would continue being guests in
Mercosur, with the tariff deregulations already made, but
belonging to the Andean Community."
</P>
<P>
He said that the exception proposed can be considered analyzing
that Bolivia has a less developed economy and an special
geographical situation that links in a natural manner with the
Andean countries and the Mercosur members.
</P>
<P>
The Bolivian minister insisted that the government "will not
take any decision in this theme without consulting the national
entrepreneurs," who are afraid that a full membership with
Mercosur could cause an invasion of Brazilian or Argentine goods
to the small Bolivian market.
</P>
<P>
Saavedra said that the analysis of the benefits and costs of
belonging to Mercosur must be pondered jointly with the
entrepreneurs, the exporters, and the productive sectors of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Says Significant Economic Growth This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A significant mark-up on Italy's
growth prospects this year and progress against poverty were
claimed by Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We are still below forecasts at the European level, but we may
be able to reduce the gap," he said at the university in the port
city of Ancona.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema is making a series of speeches at rallies, meetings and
other events in east-central Italy, from the region of Marche up
to Veneto.
</P>
<P>
"This challenge means there can also be a significant effect on
unemployment," he said, adding that "the country is faced by an
opportunity which would have been unthinkable a few years ago, in
a situation in which public finances are under control."
</P>
<P>
He said that government measures in the last two years have
brought over 497,000 lire (about 260 U.S. dollars) above the
poverty line.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most important results achieved by the
centre-left government," he said, also signaling the major change
in the philosophy underlying the left's policies, by shifting the
focus of attention from workers' rights to the "rights of persons"
in general.
</P>
<P>
"We must slowly shift the attention towards families, children,
the handicapped and the disadvantaged," he said, adding that "
envisaging a kind of general plan for social needs in which this
is just the start."
