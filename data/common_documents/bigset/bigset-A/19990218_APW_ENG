<HEADLINE> Turner Apologizes for Pope Jokes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Ted Turner apologized for telling a Polish joke  
in reference to Pope John Paul II and for suggesting the ban on 
adultery should be dropped from the Ten Commandments. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said in a statement Wednesday night to the Catholic  
League, an anti-defamation organization, that he ``regrets any 
offense his comments may have caused ... and extends his heartfelt 
apologies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former CNN chief, who is now vice chairman of Time Warner  
Inc., made his remarks Tuesday night while addressing the National 
Family Planning and Reproductive Association in Washington. The 
group supports abortion rights and contraception, which the pope 
opposes. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked by a member of the audience what he would say if he  
ever met the pope, Turner said, ``Ever seen a Polish mine 
detector?'' He then showed the audience his foot, said Marilyn 
Keefe, spokeswoman for the association. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to say that Pope John Paul II should ``get with it --  
welcome to the 20th century,'' and said the commandment against 
adultery should be done away with, according to Wednesday's edition 
of the Washington Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner also suggested a ``one-child'' policy for all couples  
worldwide to help control the world's population. Turner, who along 
with wife Jane Fonda promised $1 billion to the United Nations last 
year for population control programs, has five children. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly accept his apology and this brings closure to the  
incident,'' said William Donahue, president of the Catholic League. 
``What is disturbing to me is that reportedly, his comments were 
received with wild applause from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he had said the same thing about Indians or blacks, I don't  
think that would have sat too well with the people there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Turner said Christianity was ``for losers,'' then  
apologized at a church a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner also has compared fellow media mogul Rupert Murdoch to  
Adolf Hitler and once suggested in a speech that unemployed blacks 
be used to haul mobile missiles ``like Egyptians building the 
pyramids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He later told civil rights leaders he was kidding.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads to Explosives Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A utility repairman whose work lockers were  
stuffed with explosives pleaded guilty to possession and could get 
up to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for Paul Madronich's plea Wednesday, prosecutors  
dropped charges of possessing destructive devices and the materials 
to create them with the intent to harm. 
</P>
<P>
	Madronich, 44, was arrested Dec. 31 after bomb-making books,  
explosive devices and chemicals -- including 250 pounds of ammonium 
nitrate -- were found in his locker at a Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. 
substation in San Francisco and at the home he shared with his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney, Jerry Ladar, said Madronich had no intention of  
harming anyone but merely had an unusual hobby -- making small 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ammonium nitrate, commonly used as a fertilizer, was the  
principal ingredient in the bomb that destroyed the Oklahoma City 
federal building in 1995, killing 168 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Madronich will be sentenced after doctors determine whether he  
could be a repeat offender.

<HEADLINE> Kurtz Glorious in 'Mineola Twins' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's an embarrassment of riches: two Swoosies in  
one play. Well, one Swoosie actually, but you will think you are 
seeing double. 
</P>
<P>
	Swoosie Kurtz gloriously plays two roles in ``The Mineola  
Twins,'' Paula Vogel's wild satire on 40 years of growing up female 
in America. 
</P>
<P>
	The play, in a terrific production on view at the Roundabout  
Theater Company's smaller stage, is a mini-history of the woman's 
movement -- with side trips that comment, among other things, on 
women's hairstyles and the deep divisions between the left and the 
right. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurtz portrays both Myra and Myrna, twins who are identical  
except for what the play refers to as their ``chestal areas.'' 
Myrna, the good twin, is stacked. Myra, the evil one, is not. By 
the end of the play, their bust sizes remain the same, although 
their personal moralities have undergone considerable changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Vogel begins the journey in the 1950s in Mineola, a New York  
suburb on Long Island. The place is a burger palace worthy of 
``Grease.'' Good girl Myrna and boyfriend Jim, perched on a series 
of diner stools, nearly go all the way. Yet our heroine abruptly 
switches gears, confessing to her beau, ``I have to earn the right 
to wear white when I walk down the aisle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the next scene, trashy Myra and nerdy Jim consummate their  
relationship in a seedy motel, an act that earns them Myrna's 
undying enmity. 
</P>
<P>
	In subsequent scenes and decades, Myrna's mental condition  
deteriorates. That doesn't stop her from becoming a conservative 
radio talk-show host and incipient abortion-clinic bomber. Hmmmm, 
is Vogel suggesting a connection here? 
</P>
<P>
	Myra, on the other hand, gets through the 1960s protesting,  
smoking dope and robbing banks, before turning into the homebody 
Myrna once was and settling into a comfy relationship with her 
girlfriend Sarah. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody does demented better than Kurtz. With her elastic  
features and a sharp, fire truck voice, the actress is a physical 
as well as a verbal comedian. Kurtz also is the best quick-change 
artist working in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	For this play, she has to be. Myra and Myrna alternate on stage  
with increasing frequency as the play progresses. It is an old 
vaudeville trick that produces major sight gags. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Joe Mantello does a masterful job making the years  
speed by. The settings by designer Robert Brill, with an assist 
from Scott Pask, are smart and funny, including that suburban diner 
and the tacky, neon-lighted motel room. The outlandish costumes by 
Jess Goldstein are equally wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
	Mantello has assembled a superb supporting cast including Mo  
Gaffney, doing double-gender duty. She not only plays Myrna's 
unfaithful boyfriend but Myra's lesbian lover as well. Mandy 
Siegfried does some gender-bending of her own, with the actress 
first portraying the son of one twin and later the son of the other 
twin. 
</P>
<P>
	Vogel wrote ``The Mineola Twins'' before her prize-winning ``How  
I Learned to Drive,'' and, in style and tone, it is completely 
different. Yet beneath its fierce humor, there is a sense of 
outrage, too. Vogel can be polemical without being preachy. 
</P>
<P>
	One final note of praise: to Bobby Miller, credited with the  
play's hair design. Miller's collection of wigs -- some of which 
adorn the front of the stage like footlights -- capture perfectly 
America's fascination with excess. From Annette Funicello to Monica 
Lewinsky, big hair still lives.

<HEADLINE> LA Expected To Host DNC Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Talks between Los Angeles and the  
Democratic National Committee to put the party's 2000 presidential 
convention in California are in the final stages. Barring a 
last-minute glitch, the decision will soon be formal, party 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino was told in a telephone call  
Wednesday from Joe Andrew, head of the party's site selection team, 
that the convention contract had been offered to Los Angeles, said 
Menino's spokeswoman, Jacque Goddard. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet party officials said the deal was not quite sealed.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Democratic National Committee has not made a final  
decision on the city to host the 2000 Democratic National 
Convention,'' DNC spokeswoman Melissa Bonney Ratcliff said 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we have intensified discussions with Los Angeles  
recently, nothing has been finalized,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the selection process, speaking on condition  
of anonymity, said Los Angeles officials had been given a draft 
contract for the convention. But party and city officials were 
still reviewing the document and settling final details, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks senior Democratic officials have said Los Angeles is  
all but certain to host the party's next convention. But they have 
maintained Boston and Denver as options in case the party in Los 
Angeles can't resolve differences on money and other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The DNC hopes to make a formal, public announcement in early  
March,'' Ratcliff said. Other party officials said the announcement 
could come sooner. Vice President Al Gore, who is seeking the 
party's nomination and would make California a cornerstone of his 
campaign strategy, is tentatively scheduled to visit the state in 
the next week or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Before receiving the phone call from Andrew, Menino had told a  
Boston press conference he was confident that the DNC was going 
with Los Angeles -- and the state's 54 electoral votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a secret anymore,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Steve Grossman, outgoing chairman of the DNC, said no final  
decision had been made. But he said Los Angeles is ``perhaps the 
clear front-runner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan said he was heartened by  
reports in the Boston media that Boston was out of contention. But 
both he and the city's chief negotiator said they have not been 
told of a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to be optimistic,'' said Lucy McCoy, director of  
the Los Angeles host committee. ``We're negotiating, and the DNC is 
negotiating with Denver and Boston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans decided last month to hold their 2000 convention in  
Philadelphia. Indianapolis, New Orleans, New York and San Antonio 
had also sought to host the GOP convention.

<HEADLINE> License Photo Co. Got Federal Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State officials and civil liberties groups are  
fearful that privacy violations could arise from a planned national 
databank of driver's license photos. Those fears were heightened 
Thursday when they learned that the Secret Service helped finance 
the undertaking by a private company. 
</P>
<P>
	The company developing the databank says there's nothing to  
worry about -- the photos would only be used to combat check fraud 
and other crimes involving the misuse of personal identification. 
And the Secret Service wouldn't have access to the photos or the 
system, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawmakers who arranged the Secret Service funds for Image  
Data LLC of Nashua, N.H., suggested that the databank could 
potentially be used to fight terrorism and immigration abuses. That 
has set off alarms among privacy advocates and state officials who 
worry that what was billed as a system to protect consumers from 
fraud could be used as a tool to track the activities of private 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a high-tech wolf in sheep's clothing,'' said Marc  
Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in 
Washington. ``There's a lot more going on here than check 
verification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three states that agreed to sell their driver's license  
photos to Image Data -- South Carolina, Florida and Colorado -- were 
already trying to get out of agreements after consumers voiced 
concerns about how the photos would be used. The disclosure 
Thursday by The Washington Post that the company received $1.46 
million from the Secret Service for the project gave new ammunition 
to state officials, who said they weren't informed of the federal 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were never told of their conspiracy with the federal  
government and their efforts to use this information to track the 
activities of South Carolina citizens,'' said Jim Klauber, a member 
of the state legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina's attorney general has called for an  
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the American Civil Liberties Union and other  
groups called for hearings and tighter drivers' privacy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Image Data denied that it misled states about its TrueID system,  
which -- when fully operational -- would send photo images from its 
databank to merchants so they can check the identification of 
customers paying with checks. The system is being tested at 10 
stores in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The Secret Service funding simply never came up, said Lorna  
Christie, Image Data spokeswoman. The company was barred from 
discussing the Secret Service's involvement, anyway, she added. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was used to fund the test phase of the project. The  
Secret Service, which oversees the government's efforts to combat 
credit card and check fraud, benefits from the system because it's 
``a tool for detecting fraud,'' Christie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than funneling money to the project, Secret Service  
officials said the agency's only role was to provide expertise on 
how financial crimes are committed. Congress requested that the 
agency provide funds to Image Data, which will report back to the 
Secret Service on how the system is working, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency did not advise the company on how to gather the  
photos, and it will not have access to the images, the officials 
said. They said they were not aware of similar funding arrangements 
with other companies or any plans to use the information to fight 
terrorism or immigration abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Contracts and state laws specify that the company can only use  
driver's license information for fraud prevention, Christie said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To suggest that Image Data intends to break its contracts or  
obligation under law is irresponsible and blatantly wrong,'' the 
company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Several lawmakers pushing for federal funds for the project  
cited other possible uses. 
</P>
<P>
	TrueID ``has widespread potential to reduce crime in the credit  
and checking fields, in airports to reduce the chances of 
terrorism, and in immigration and naturalization to verity proper 
identity,'' according to two 1997 letters to Sen. Ben Nighthorse 
Campbell, R-Colo., chairman of an appropriations committee panel 
that oversees the Secret Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers asked for $4.6 million. The company eventually  
received $1.46 million in the fiscal 1998 budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Secret Service can provide technical assistance and assess  
the effectiveness of this new technology,'' said a September 1997 
letter signed by eight lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie said the lawmaker used ``a very broad range of the  
types of uses'' for TrueID and said the company is focused on 
retail and banking applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., supported the project because it  
could help combat identity-based crimes that cost government, 
businesses and citizens over $25 billion annually, said his 
spokesman Maury Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hollings believes people should be able to opt out of the  
database, he added.

<HEADLINE>  Couch Planning Show for Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Browns are still Tim Couch's No. 1 pick.  
</P>
<P>
	Couch, who announced last month he was leaving Kentucky early  
for a chance to become the top pick in the NFL draft, said he did 
so because he wanted to play in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing, not even the Browns uncertainty with what they'll do  
with the first overall selection, has changed the All-American 
quarterback's mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really like Cleveland,'' he said Thursday. ``It's a  
working-class city and that's what I'm used to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch was in town to accept an award from the Cleveland  
Touchdown Club as its 1998 college player of the year. He was to 
receive the trophy at an evening banquet, but because of 
overwhelming interview requests, the Touchdown Club held an 
afternoon news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	It was merely coincidence, but Couch holding his award with a  
brown and orange banner complete with Browns helmet and the 
initials TC was kind of funny. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, this is not my last trip to Cleveland,'' Couch  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with more than 300 other potential NFL hopefuls, Couch is  
on his way to Indianapolis for this week's scouting combine. 
However, he won't be working out there. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Couch will hold his own personal workout in Lexington,  
Ky., on March 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think it's going to be a better environment for me to  
work out privately,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch has been plotting his strategy for the Browns like he used  
to prepare for facing Alabama's defense. Using four Wildcat wide 
receivers, including Craig Yeast, a potential high-round draft pick 
himself, Couch plans to throw everything he's got at Browns coach 
Chris Palmer, football operations director Dwight Clark and 
whomever else makes the trip down from Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go out and try and put on a good show for  
them,'' Couch said. ``I'll try and show them exactly what they want 
to see. We've been going over our game plan like we're preparing 
for a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The knock on Couch by the so-called draft experts is his arm  
strength. He rarely got a chance to throw deep down the field while 
at Kentucky, but he's sure he can air it out far enough to play in 
the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	During his workout, Couch, who compared his playing style to  
Green Bay's Brett Favre, said he'll show the Browns he can throw 
the deep ball over the middle. He's going to throw the 15-yard out. 
He'll roll out. He'll drop back. He'll do whatever it takes to make 
the Browns believe in him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been preparing for this for about 18 years,'' he said.  
``I'm just going to go out there and not press and be the player I 
know that I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch knows the Browns could decide to take Texas running back  
Ricky Williams with their No. 1 pick, or they could trade the 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always a chance that could happen,'' he said. ``A lot  
can happen between now and April 17. I'm going to have to wait this 
out, but hopefully I'll persuade them to take me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch said he's been monitoring the Browns rebirth, and has been  
impressed with what the expansion team has done so far. He was 
glued to the TV on the day of the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh yeah, I watched all that,'' he said. ``I think it's been  
great. ``They've already got a really good offensive line in 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns have been shopping for a veteran quarterback, and  
could be bringing in 42-year-old Warren Moon for a visit next week. 
Couch understands that spending a year as an understudy could be 
helpful. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they do bring in a veteran it can do nothing but help me,''  
he said. ``But just for competition, I'd like to be on the field 
and learn on the run. But if they want me to sit that would be 
fine.''

	``I am asking all of you to join me today to chart the right  
course for America and sail safely into the 21st century with a 
commitment to keep America strong and free for millions yet 
unborn,'' he said, referring to his anti-abortion beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the charts -- the Constitution, the Declaration of  
Independence and the Holy Bible. We need a captain and a crew who 
will read those charts, and steer us past the sea of icebergs that 
threaten our God-given rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Pilgrims' landing at Plymouth Rock was far north of  
the Hudson River area they were aiming for, and the Titanic's 
captain didn't accidentally stray from the normal course but 
intentionally veered south after receiving numerous warnings from 
other ships about ice in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech citing the words of personalities as diverse as  
Thomas Jefferson and Merle Haggard, Smith said he has the 
principles and passion to lead the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Political leadership is not about who gives the best speech,  
it's not about who has the most money, it's not about who the media 
thinks is the front-runner,'' he said. ``It's about character, it's 
about integrity, it's about a commitment to principle. And it is 
about bold, courageous, passionate, committed leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said one of his first priorities as president would be  
pushing Congress to define life as beginning at fertilization. 
During a 1995 Senate debate on late-term abortions, Smith waved a 
plastic fetus, showed pictures of a baby that had survived an 
abortion and described the late-term procedure in bloody detail. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the 1860s, Lincoln ended the moral outrage of slavery  
because he knew it was wrong. Abortion is the moral outrage of the 
20th century, and I will end it because it, too, is wrong,'' he 
said. ``I don't want to get in your face on abortion; I want to get 
in your heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he also would seek a thorough review of the armed  
services to correct problems that threaten to weaken them. The Air 
Force alone will face a shortage of 2,000 pilots by 2002, he said, 
and there is a shortage of parts for military equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Danger is on the horizon,'' he said. ``Our nation is  
completely vulnerable to a nuclear, biological or chemical missile 
attack from rogue nations such as North Korea, Iran and Libya.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the U.S.-Russian Joint Commission on POWs and  
MIAs, Smith has been a leader in the effort to determine the fate 
of missing prisoners of war and servicemen listed as missing in 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can take Bob Smith's word to the bank,'' said Capt. Eugene  
``Red'' McDaniel, a naval airman who was a prisoner of war for six 
years after being shot down over Vietnam in 1967. ``What do we need 
more at this junction in history than a man who can inspire our 
children and grandchildren to make America a better place?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is raising campaign funds by selling $20 ``shares'' so  
voters can ``invest in America.'' He's raised $100,000 in the last 
30 days and hopes to collect $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	After two failed House campaigns, Smith was elected in 1984 to  
the first of three congressional terms. He was elected to the 
Senate in 1990 and re-elected by a narrow margin in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent poll of New Hampshire Republicans by the independent  
American Research Group, Smith placed near the bottom among likely 
presidential contenders, despite its being his home state. Only 4 
percent said they would vote for him in the primary; 25 percent 
said they would support Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith said he pays no attention to polls: ``Can you imagine  
Patrick Henry in 1773 giving his `Give me liberty or give me death' 
speech and turning to an aide to say, `I'm not sure if the people 
want liberty or death, we should take a poll?'''

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Survivor Sues Bayer AG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- One of the hundreds of twins experimented on  
by the infamous Dr. Josef Mengele at Auschwitz is suing Bayer AG, 
saying the German pharmaceutical giant collaborated with the Nazi 
scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in federal court in Terre Haute,  
alleges Bayer paid Nazi officials for access to people in 
concentration camps and used the experiments as a form of research 
and development during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Holocaust survivors and Jewish organizations  
have sued banks that held on to the assets of Holocaust victims and 
companies that allegedly profited from Nazi actions through the use 
of slave labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Polish immigrant Eva Mozes Kor's lawsuit is thought to be the  
first to target a German company for Nazi medical experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	She contends Bayer tested the effectiveness of its drugs on  
prisoners injected with disease-causing germs. Her lawsuit says a 
Bayer physician, identified only as Dr. Koenig, accompanied Mengele 
on experiments, recorded the results and reported back to Bayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kor, who declined to comment Thursday, is seeking  
unspecified punitive damages and the recovery of profits Bayer 
allegedly earned as a result of Mengele's research. 
</P>
<P>
	For many years, the maker of Bayer aspirin has denied  
involvement in the experiments and refused to offer compensation, 
according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayer spokesman Thomas Reinert in Leverkusen, Germany, said  
Thursday: ``This is an issue we have to look at carefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kor and her sister, Miriam, survived their 10-month ordeal  
at Auschwitz and were liberated by Soviet troops in 1945, when they 
were nearly 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Miriam died in 1993 of kidney disease. Her kidneys had never  
grown to adult size because of her treatment at Auschwitz, 
according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayer was founded in 1836 and in the 1920s merged with I.G.  
Farben, a conglomerate that worked thousands of people to death in 
Nazi slave camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar allegations of collaboration in Nazi medical experiments  
were levied against Farben during the Nuremberg trials but were 
``rejected as false,'' the Bayer spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, Farben's assets were divided among Hoechst, BASF, Bayer  
and other companies, and Farben remains basically as a trust to 
settle claims and lawsuits from the Nazi era. Reinert said Bayer 
should not be held responsible for any acts that may have been 
committed by Farben. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Bayer was among a dozen German companies that said  
they would participate in a fund to compensate slave laborers 
drafted from concentration camps. Some experts estimate the fund at 
$1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los  
Angeles, said he expects Mrs. Kor's lawsuit to lead to similar 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``If companies are paying compensation for slave labor,'' he  
said, ``why shouldn't they pay for medical experiments?''

<HEADLINE> Employers, IG Metall Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Employers and metalworkers reached a  
last-minute agreement early Thursday, but the threat of a strike by 
Germany's largest union remains, as some employers say the wage 
agreed upon in the negotiating district won't be feasible for other 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers and union representatives reached the agreement in  
Baden-Wuerttemberg, which is home to DaimlerChrysler. Employers 
warned that the package may be too rich for other areas, where the 
economy is weaker. 
</P>
<P>
	They agreed to 14-month contracts that include 3.2 percent  
raises, a one-time payment of 1 percent of wages, plus an 
additional 350 marks ($159) each for January and February. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers' representatives said the package amounts to a 3.6  
percent raise, while the IG Metall union, using a different 
formula, said it was a 4.2 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The last-minute deal won praise from Chancellor Gerhard  
Schroeder's center-left coalition, which had leaned on both sides 
to avoid a potentially damaging strike. Finance Minister Oskar 
Lafontaine called it a ``reasonable agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Bernhard Jagoda, the head of the federal labor office in  
Nuremberg, described the agreement as ``a thousand times better 
than a strike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder had warned that a strike in the nation's core  
industries would hurt the slowing economy and likely worsen 
unemployment. Germany's growth forecast has dropped to 2 percent 
this year from 2.8 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But Werner Stumpfe of the Gesamtmetall employers' group said the  
agreement would add to the already high costs of doing business in 
Germany and lead to job losses. 
</P>
<P>
	He warned the other nine negotiating districts that still have  
to settle wage talks, especially in eastern Germany where 
joblessness is nearly 19 percent, not to expect the same results. 
</P>
<P>
	Union chairman Klaus Zwickel said any lesser wage agreement in  
the other districts was ``unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IG Metall, whose 2.7 million membership includes workers at  
DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen, says it expects all negotiating 
districts to get the same deal. In all, some 3.4 million 
metalworkers are affected by the wage talks, and the IG Metall deal 
also traditionally sets the pace for wage hikes in other 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Dieter Hundt, head of the German Employers' Association, called  
the agreement ``very damaging'' to the government's efforts to 
bring business, labor and government together into talks on 
reducing Germany's 11.5 percent unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Other unions will be seeking to obtain similar results in their  
negotiations. The HBV and DAG, for example, the unions for 
blue-collar bank and insurance company employees, are demanding 6.5 
pay increases as did IG Metall before the latest agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Herbert Mai, the head of OeTV, the public workers  
and transport union, called the settlement ``orientation'' for his 
union.

<HEADLINE> UPS Profits Up 87 Pcrcent for Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service's profit rose 37 percent in  
the fourth quarter and 87 percent for the year, citing a profitable 
global expansion and full recovery from a 1997 strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The company benefited from low fuel prices, cost-containment  
efforts, a broadening of products including Web-based document 
delivery and the first annual profit from its international 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The privately-held delivery company earned $482 million in the  
last three months of 1998, up from $351 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter was $6.66 billion, up 8.6 percent from  
$6.14 billion for the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, it earned $1.7 billion compared with $909 million  
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the year totaled $24.8 billion, up 10.4 percent  
over 1997 revenues of $22.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A 15-day Teamsters strike in August 1997 crippled the company  
and undercut business for months afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS began a global expansion 11 years ago that now has the  
company serving more than 200 countries and territories. The growth 
of online shopping also is boosting UPS, which said one survey 
found that 55 percent of items purchased from online retailers for 
Christmas 1998 were shipped via UPS. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's international volume climbed 10.5 percent for the  
year, with 12.2 percent growth in European business. Overseas 
revenues totaled $3.2 billion and profits were $56 million, 
compared with a loss of $67 million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a great year for us, but the best is yet to come,''  
said Jim Kelly, UPS chairman and chief executive officer. ``Our 
e-commerce strategies are bearing fruit and no company is bettered 
positioned to serve the world of digital commerce than UPS.''

	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit Red Wings star Sergei Fedorov is  
contributing his entire $2 million salary to a new charity that 
will help area children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hockey has provided me with a means to an exciting and

will give university scholarships to students from at-risk 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Fedorov missed most of last season in a contract dispute that

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Tighter Currency Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of a visit from French President  
Jacques Chirac, the Clinton administration threw cold water on his 
proposal to link the world's major currencies as a way to prevent 
future global currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said while the idea of creating  
more stability between the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen and the 
new European euro was appealing in theory, the practical problems 
of doing it were ``enormous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Chirac said he planned to use his Washington visit to  
promote the French currency stability plan in meetings Thursday 
with officials at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank 
and in discussions Friday with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world financial system needs to be improved because the  
world has changed,'' Chirac said in an interview in Paris with The 
Associated Press and Associated Press Television News. ``We should 
not accept too large'' fluctuations in currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	While France has received support for its ideas from Germany and  
Japan, the plan is unlikely to advance given the strong opposition 
of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Washington meetings, the idea will be on the  
agenda when Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan meet 
with their counterparts from the world's largest economies in Bonn, 
Germany, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the disagreement over currency alignment proposals,  
Rubin said the Group of Seven nations -- the United States, Japan, 
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- were committed to 
overhauling the global financial architecture to prevent future 
Asian-style currency crises from occurring. 
</P>
<P>
	While Brazil was rocked earlier this year when it was forced to  
devalue its currency, there are a number of signs that some Asian 
nations are beginning to stabilize after steep downturns. The 
crisis began in Asia in July 1997 and leveled the Russian economy 
last August, triggering major turbulence in U.S. and other world 
markets and prompting the Fed to cut interest rates to restore 
calm. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-7 finance officials are expected to endorse two smaller  
proposals on Saturday to promote greater disclosure of foreign 
currency reserves among countries and to create an informal forum 
where countries can discuss voluntary ways to improve their 
regulation of financial institutions, including banks, brokerage 
houses and hedge funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. economy has continued to expand at healthy rates  
despite the global turmoil that has sent America's trade deficit 
soaring, increasing protectionist pressures as American 
manufacturers and farmers suffer from the loss of overseas markets 
and a flood of cheaper imports into this country. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the ``international system cannot sustain  
indefinitely'' such huge trade imbalances and he called on Japan 
and Europe to do more to stimulate domestic growth and serve as 
markets for troubled economies. 
</P>
<P>
	While the French have not totally spelled out their views on how  
major currencies could be better aligned, one major idea being 
explored would be to create bands for the major currencies with 
commitments by countries to intervene by buying and selling 
currencies on the open market to maintain those exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rubin told reporters Wednesday that ``bands become wonderful  
speculative targets for those who are worried about speculation'' 
as traders test government's resolve to spend their reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists are split on the idea of establishing a more  
stable currency trading system. Many argue that a government's 
efforts to maintain a fixed currency level are destined to be 
overwhelmed by the size of the global currency market where $1.5 
trillion is traded daily. But some analysts insist it is critical 
that some system be established to tame current volatility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have learned a lot in the past two years about the dangers  
of unfettered markets,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, economist at the 
Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington think tank. ``We have got 
to find a way to slow massive capital flows down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the Bonn meeting is expected to also call for further  
discussions among G-7 countries and developing nations at a 
conference in Germany in mid-March and a follow-up meeting in 
Washington in April.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets -- including Tokyo and  
Singapore -- ended mostly lower in subdued trading Thursday on the 
back of Wall Street's overnight losses. South Korea's key index 
plunged, and the Hong Kong market was closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 11.88  
points, or 0.08 percent, to close at 14,146.79. On Wednesday, the 
average had lost 73.97 points, or 0.52 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. market tumbled and at this moment investors are  
taking profits,'' said Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa 
Securities Co. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 101.56 points, 
or 1.1 percent, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets had risen earlier in the week after Japan's central bank  
cut a key interest rate to help bolster the nation's flagging 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the overseas editions of the Financial Times quoted  
Eisuke Sakakibara, the vice minister for international affairs, as 
saying that the central bank's willingness to take radical steps to 
boost the economy is now ``much, much stronger than the market 
currently realizes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those comments helped push the U.S. dollar higher against the  
yen by raising concerns that Japan's record-low interest rates may 
drop even further. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading, the dollar bought 118.68 yen, up 0.06 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 119.02 
yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen's fall triggered sharp falls in South Korean shares,  
with the key Kospi index plunging 15.36 points, or 2.8 percent, to 
536.41. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean exports lose their price competitiveness against  
Japanese rivals when the yen slides. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, shares also fell on Wall Street's decline, after a  
two-day market break to mark the Chinese New year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Straits Times Index fell to 1,335.01 points, down 26.14  
points, or 1.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Hong Kong and Taiwan were closed for  
Chinese New Year holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai shares fell slightly despite late buying by  
foreign fund managers. The SET index dropped 1.55 points, or 0.5 
percent, to 336.47. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares rose as local investors speculatively  
bought selected low-priced blue chips, anticipating they would 
announce stronger 1998 earnings. The JSX Composite Index rose 5.439 
points, or 1.4 percent, to 403.414 points. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares finished moderately lower in  
quiet trading after a three-day break for Chinese New Year. The 
Composite index fell to 566.29, down 4.5 points, or 0.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks finished higher as investors bought  
shares that became cheaper after Wednesday's fall. The PSE index 
rose 8.88 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,927.45, 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares closed nearly flat, torn between  
arbitrage-related selling, some positive corporate earnings and a

<HEADLINE> EPA To Demand Cleaner Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to dramatically cut air pollution in  
the next decade, the Environmental Protection Agency is set to 
propose tough new requirements for cleaner cars and gasoline, 
including a dramatic reduction in pollution from popular sport 
utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft proposal could be sent to the White House for review  
as early as Friday, according to government sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed regulations, which would go into effect in 2004,  
have been the subject of intense lobbying by both the auto and oil 
industries and could shape the kind of cars Americans will drive 
over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, automakers would be required to make popular  
sport utility vehicles, which now account for nearly half of the 
market, as pollution free as passenger cars, according to sources 
familiar with the general outline of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, the largest SUVs would be given additional time  
to comply, however, according to one source, who like others who 
discussed the proposal, did so under conditions of not being 
further identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA also plans to require oil companies to dramatically  
reduce the amount of sulfur in gasoline sold nationwide. The 
low-sulfur gas will have to contain on average 30 parts per million 
sulfur. Outside of California, gasoline today has more than 10 
times that amount in most parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA officials declined to comment on the draft proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	Industry sources and environmentalists, some of whom had been  
briefed on the proposed rules, said that they largely mirror the 
tougher emission requirements already planned in California, 
beginning in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	That would include a reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions from  
cars from the current 0.4 grams per mile to 0.05 grams per mile in 
2004. The automakers already have committed to cutting these 
emissions to 0.2 grams per mile under a national low-emissions 
vehicle program beginning in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists said tailpipe releases of hydrocarbons and  
nitrogen oxide, both sources of urban smog, would be cut by as much 
as 90 percent from levels required today outside California. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision will dictate how clean cars will be in the first  
decades of the 21st century,'' said Michelle Robinson of the Union 
of Concerned Scientists. Most important, she added, is that for the 
first time it will mean sharp reductions in emissions from SUVs, 
which, along with pickups and minivans, account for nearly half of 
the vehicles sold today. 
</P>
<P>
	William Becker, executive director of the association  
representing state air pollution control officials, said the 
tougher emission controls on both cars and SUVs will be essential 
if states are to meet future air quality mandates. 
</P>
<P>
	The cleaner gasoline alone is equivalent to taking 54 million  
cars off the road, said Becker, adding that the tougher tailpipe 
standards will be like removing an additional 50 million cars by 
the year 2020. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules have been the focus of fierce lobbying by both the  
auto and oil industries. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, auto executives, meeting with EPA officials,  
argued that while they're ready to dramatically cut emissions on 
cars and many of the smaller and mid-size SUVs, they should be 
given more time, and face less stringent standards, for the larger 
SUVs such as the Ford Expedition and Chevy Suburban. 
</P>
<P>
	``We told them we can do most of what you want, but just can't  
get as low or as fast as you want'' on the larger sport utility 
vehicles, said one auto executive who has been involved in the 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	The large SUVs are among the best sellers in showrooms. Last  
year they accounted for 28 percent of the SUVs sold, compared to 24 
percent a year earlier, according to Ward's Automotive, which 
tracks auto industry sales. 
</P>
<P>
	According to sources, the EPA may still give some flexibility to  
automakers on meeting the tougher emission standards for the larger 
SUVs as long as manufacturers meet their overall fleet averages. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil executives said the cleaner low-sulfur gasoline would cost 5  
to 6 cents a gallon more to produce. The more stringent tailpipe 
emission requirements may add $160 to $200 to the cost of a car, 
according to EPA and California state agency estimates.

<HEADLINE> EPA To Demand Cleaner Snowmobiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government wants to clean up the smoky  
engines of snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles after finding they 
are contributing to air pollution in some areas of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency plans to propose emission  
standards that likely would force manufacturers to redesign or 
replace the two-stroke engine standard on snowmobiles and some 
ATVs. The changes could add several hundred dollars to the 
vehicles' retail prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent study, the EPA claimed the machines emit 25 percent  
as many hydrocarbons as all the nation's cars and trucks put 
together. More than 66 times as many cars and trucks are in use as 
snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're always more than willing to work with them to meet any  
requirements they set forth,'' said Heather Hauschild, a 
spokeswoman for Arctic Cat Inc., one of the largest manufacturers 
of snowmobiles. ``All we hope is that the guidelines will be 
sensible, steps that we can meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Standards also will be developed for forklifts, compressors,  
generators and similar gasoline-powered equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is definitely none too soon,'' said Russell Long, executive  
director of the Bluewater Network, a coalition of environmental 
groups. ``The EPA dragged their feet for many years before looking 
at these sources of pollution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Congress required the EPA to study motor vehicles of  
all kinds and decide whether to set or tighten emission standards. 
A lawsuit by the Sierra Club forced the agency to agree last summer 
to speed up its work. 
</P>
<P>
	Emission standards for outboard motors and personal watercraft  
such as Jet Skis go into effect in 2006. Standards also have been 
set for farm tractors and will be out soon for lawnmowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jet Skis use the same two-stroke engine as snowmobiles. Some new  
models, which cost $800 more than earlier ones, use a 
fuel-injection system that cuts emissions by 80 percent. 
Environmentalists say that is not enough of an improvement and want 
the two-stroke engine scrapped altogether in favor of 
cleaner-burning four-stroke models. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem with the two-stroke engine is it typically burns  
only two-thirds of its fuel, spewing the rest into the air as part 
of the exhaust. The injection system helps some, but studies show 
the modified two-stroke still is at least three times dirtier than 
a four-stroke motor. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-stroke engines are preferred for snowmobiles because they  
start better in cold weather and accelerate more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	In a notice filed Feb. 8, the EPA estimated snowmobiles and ATVs  
produce 1.1 million tons of hydrocarbons a year, or 15 percent of 
all that emitted from mobile sources, including cars, trucks, 
airplanes, locomotives and lawnmowers. By 2010, that share is 
expected to rise to 19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cars and trucks produce 4.5 million tons of hydrocarbons, a  
principal ingredient in the creation of summer smog. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowmobiles and ATVs also account for an estimated 9 percent of  
carbon monoxide emissions and 2 percent of particulate matter. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA officials said they expect manufacturers to contest some of  
their findings, but the industry already is at work on new engine 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	American Honda Motor Co., the biggest maker of ATVs, said in a  
statement Thursday that it is ``committed to developing practical 
and achievable emissions reductions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, environmental groups petitioned for a ban on  
snowmobiles in the national park system. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 120,000 snowmobiles enter Yellowstone National Park each  
year. The air around the park's west entrance, where they 
congregate, is sometimes thick with blue smoke. Near Old Faithful 
geyser, snowmobiles create more pollution in a weekend than a 
year's worth of automobile traffic, the environmental groups said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. sales of snowmobiles have doubled since 1992 to more than  
160,000 a year, and about 1.3 million are now in use. An additional 
1.7 million ATVs, dirt bikes, mopeds and go-carts, 20 percent of 
which use two-stroke engines, also are in use, the EPA says. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, 200 million cars and trucks are on the road.

<HEADLINE> Poll Finds Kids Toughter on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Children are tougher on President Clinton than  
their parents, a new poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of children aged 8 to 14 polled last weekend by  
the Nickelodeon television network said Clinton should have been 
removed from office following his impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 40 percent of parents surveyed by Nickelodeon believed  
that, compared to 52 percent of their youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be an attitude of `If I do something bad and get  
caught, I get punished.' It probably is just that simple,'' said 
Linda Ellerbee, host of the Nick News program on the youth-oriented 
cable network. 
</P>
<P>
	In another survey taken by Nickelodeon last September, only 26  
percent of children and 11 percent of their parents said they 
wanted to see Clinton impeached and removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the harsh attitude toward Clinton's behavior in the  
Lewinsky scandal, three-quarters of the children and their parents 
believe he was an average or better president. That's similar to 
poll results from September and January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps with an eye toward what Clinton has been through, 56  
percent of the children surveyed said they were not interested in 
being president when they grew up. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickelodeon polled 309 children and their parents. The margin  
for error was 5.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> New Bears Staff Gets To Know Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- The Chicago Bears' new coaching staff  
is slowly settling in. 
</P>
<P>
	There are the new offices to navigate -- Where's that coffee  
machine again? 
</P>
<P>
	There are all those confusing Chicago highways -- Edens or  
Eisenhower? And who's Dan Ryan? 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's the most important task, figuring out just what  
talent the Bears have and what they need to climb out of the 
doldrums they've wallowed in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we care about is looking ahead at this point, and that's  
what we're selling,'' new coach Dick Jauron said. ``For whatever 
reason, there hasn't been much success here recently. We need 
people to turn things around and get it going in the right 
direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But just who those people will be and how Jauron and his staff  
are going to do it is still up in the air. Jauron, the former 
Jacksonville defensive coordinator who was hired to replace Dave 
Wannstedt, and his staff head to the NFL scouting combine in 
Indianapolis on Friday to evaluate draft prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Bears' biggest needs is at quarterback. Though  
veteran Erik Kramer missed the second half of last season with a 
shoulder problem, he's attacked his rehabilitation with a 
vengeance, and the Bears are expecting at least a couple more good 
years from him. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's also 34, so Chicago has to start thinking about life  
after him. The Bears already have Moses Moreno, who showed promise 
as a rookie last year. There are plenty of good quarterbacks in 
this year's draft, too, and the Bears would have the luxury of 
letting a top pick learn and develop for a few years under Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's merit on having a young quarterback on your team while  
you have a veteran,'' quarterbacks coach John Shoop said. ``Who 
that guy is, whether he's on our team right now, I don't know. It 
might be a better question to ask in a month or two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears have two solid running backs in Edgar Bennett and  
Curtis Enis, their first-round pick last year, but that position is 
a little uncertain, too. The running game was less productive than 
expected, in part because of the Bennett-Enis rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	And Enis is still recovering from that torn knee ligaments that  
ended his season prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of them has different strengths,'' said Earle Mosley, the  
running backs coach. ``I think there's enough of the running game 
to go around. It's not the number of reps you get, it's what you do 
with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensively, the Bears are looking to bolster their pass rush  
after finishing 28th in sack percentage (28 total) last year. They 
signed end Clyde Simmons, whose 114 career sacks are 10th-best in 
the NFL, to a two-year, $4 million deal Wednesday, and they're 
still pursuing New York Giants end Chad Bratzke. 
</P>
<P>
	Bratzke, the top free-agent end, canceled all of his visits  
after his father's death, but the Bears hope to meet with him next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing the Bears do know is that their offense will look a  
little different. Chicago has always relied heavily on the run, and 
that's still going to be a big part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	But offensive coordinator Gary Crowton is known for his  
high-octane offenses -- his Louisiana Tech team led the nation with 
429.8 yards passing per game last year -- and he plans to bring that 
style to the NFL's black-and-blue division. 
</P>
<P>
	It's going to be different, but Crowton said he thinks fans will  
like it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every place I've been, the fans have really liked the offense  
because it's exciting,'' he said. ``It's a fan-friendly offense, 
I'll tell you that. We'll see how they like it here in Chicago.''

<HEADLINE> Newark Airport Has Worst Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The airports in Newark, N.J., and San  
Francisco ranked first and second last year in flight delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Newark International Airport had 31,924 delayed flights, or  
about 6.9 percent of its total traffic for 1998, according to 
Federal Aviation Administration data released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving up to second place was San Francisco International, which  
had 29,409 delays, or 6.8 percent of its total. The airport ranked 
third in 1997. Rounding out the top five last year were O'Hare 
International in Chicago, Hartsfield International in Atlanta and 
LaGuardia Airport in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Newark officials complained that they are paying the price for  
antiquated air traffic routing patterns that give preference to 
nearby LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and local officials are working on a plan to redesign  
the traffic patterns to better accommodate the traffic at Newark, 
where flights have doubled in the past 20 years. In 1998, the 
airport had 32.3 million passengers, surpassing the 31.6 million 
who flew in and out of Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working with the FAA so that when they do the air space  
redesign, we're the first in line,'' said Terry Benczik, a 
spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, 
which operates the Newark airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport officials are also lengthening a runway, building more  
gates, adding computerized instrument landing equipment and trying 
to persuade airlines to adjust their scheduling to reduce delays. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA labels a flight as late when it is delayed 15 minutes or  
more from its scheduled arrival or departure time. Newark ranked 
worst for the third consecutive year. It has held that distinction 
since 1991 except for a drop to seventh place in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Hare had a total of 28,751 flight delays, 3.2 percent of its  
total traffic. Hartsfield had 27,764 delays, according to the FAA 
data, also about 3.2 percent of its total traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	LaGuardia, while ranked fifth in the total number of delays, was  
similar to Newark and San Francisco in its percentage of delayed 
flights. It had 24,689 delays in 1998, about 6.8 percent of its 
total traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the top 10 were Logan International Airport in Boston,  
Lambert Airport in St. Louis, Kennedy in New York, Sky Harbor 
Airport in Phoenix and Philadelphia International. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan had 16,400 delays, or 3 percent; Lambert had 15,925  
delays, or 3.16 percent; Kennedy had 12,962 delays, or 3.6 percent; 
Sky Harbor had 11,757 delays, or 2.2 percent; and Philadelphia had 
11,552 delays, or 2.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Linux May Be Threat to Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Linux may sound more like a ``Peanuts'' cartoon  
character than a serious operating system for business computers. 
But fast-growing demand for the free software may signal an 
important new threat to Microsoft Corp., the dominant computer 
software maker. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest sign of acceptance, International Business  
Machines Corp. announced plans Thursday to start selling powerful 
business computers that come pre-loaded with Linux, a version of 
the Unix operating system that is used by companies for tasks such 
as running networks of smaller computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was viewed a major endorsement of the fledgling  
software, and comes after similar moves by Compaq Computer Corp., 
Dell Computer Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Silicon Graphics Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	During the past year, Linux has risen to the forefront among the  
relatively unknown products that can substitute for established 
Unix programs and, more importantly, for Microsoft's dominant 
Windows NT software program for corporate computers. Linux 
comprised about 17 percent of the software shipped for running 
business machines last year, up from 7 percent in 1997, says 
International Data Corp., a high-tech research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Linux has come out of almost nowhere and quickly become the  
darling of certain elements of the programming community,'' said 
Tim Bajarin, president of the Creative Strategies Inc. consulting 
firm, based in Campbell, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it remains to be seen if Linux breaks out of its status  
as a niche product and spurs mass demand among customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Users rave about Linux's positive attributes, such as its  
tendency not to crash and its flexibility. Developed in the early 
1990s by a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds, Linux can be 
downloaded for free off the Internet, or bought in commercial 
versions from distributors such as Red Hat Software for as little 
as $50. And unlike Microsoft's software blueprints, Linux's source 
code is shared over the Web, which makes it easy for programmers to 
blend in improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, a small cottage industry of developers around the  
globe has sprung up. But there still are relatively few software 
applications that run on the Linux system, particularly compared to 
Windows-compatible programs. One exception: Corel Corp., a major 
Toronto software maker, plans to sell a package of business 
software, including Word Perfect, made for Linux computers. 
</P>
<P>
	While systems administrators and programmers at companies  
increasingly are embracing Linux, many corporate managers are 
heavily committed to Microsoft through growing investments in 
Windows for desktop computers and Windows NT for business machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The momentum for Windows and Windows NT is extremely strong,''  
Bajarin said. ``Microsoft is not going to give up any territory 
without a major competitive fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, demand for Linux is exploding. The Burlington Coat  
Factory Warehouse Corp. is buying about 1,300 Linux computers this 
year for managing inventory and performing other tasks at its 250 
discount clothing stores, chief information officer Mike Prince 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The machines are replacing other Unix computers, Prince said,  
``but the alternative would have been Windows NT.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Scott, director of information technology at Corning Inc.,  
was more skeptical. He said Corning researchers currently were 
running Linux on just two of the company's 3,000 computers. 
</P>
<P>
	But at Bristol Hotels &AMP; Resorts, a Dallas-based chain of 120  
hotels, technicians use about half-a-dozen Linux computers to 
develop Internet software that will perform such tasks as letting 
hotel guests make reservations online. The company hopes to vastly 
increase its use of Linux as the Internet becomes more important to 
its business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very, very hopeful that the user community in the world  
will recognize this as an alternative and choose to embrace it,'' 
said Joshua Norrid, director of application development at Bristol, 
which uses about 4,000 computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Microsoft faces strong competition has become an  
important issue in its unfolding antitrust trial in Washington, 
which accuses Microsoft of unfairly squelching rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft stock, which has been under pressure because of the  
long-running trial, fell 2.8 percent Thursday as IBM announced its 
support of Linux, dropping $4.25 to $145.75 a share on the Nasdaq 
Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, through a spokesman, was quick to reiterate its  
contention that rivals to its business are alive and well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, it's a competitive threat,'' Microsoft spokesman  
Adam Sohn said of Linux. ``We are happy to compete head-to-head 
with Linux on the merits of the technology and the business 
model.''

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Peace Talks Inch Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- With time running out and NATO  
pressure heightening, mediators at the Kosovo peace conference 
presented rival Serbs and ethnic Albanians today with a ``final 
version'' of a political settlement for the embattled province. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Hill, the U.S. diplomat who is the chief mediator  
here, said comments from both sides were incorporated in the 
document. Both sides had been sent ``a kind invitation to consider 
it as a final version,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs and ethnic Albanians are up against a Saturday noon  
deadline to reach a deal. If they don't, NATO has threatened to 
launch airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is indeed a compromise,'' Hill said of the document.  
``There are people on both sides who are unhappy with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to get this by noontime on Saturday,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana warned that the alliance  
was prepared to act quickly if the clock runs out on the deadline 
imposed by the six-nation Contact Group -- the United States, 
Russia, France, Britain, Germany and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do hope very much that the parties are thinking about the  
consequences if they do not reach an agreement,'' he said today in 
the Macedonian capital, Skopje, with Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme 
NATO commander in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has ordered an additional 51 planes to Europe  
to beef up forces already on standby for action in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters today during a  
Seattle visit that the additional planes would begin arriving in 
Europe this weekend and would be ready for a possible attack by the 
middle of next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Richard Bridges, a Pentagon spokesman, said the fresh  
deployment demonstrates ``a clear commitment that time is running 
out'' on the Serbs to negotiate, although NATO military action 
might not happen right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an automatic 12:01, the bombs fall,'' Bridges  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian President Boris Yeltsin, however, warned the United  
States that Moscow ``will not allow Kosovo to be touched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin said today he had conveyed this message to President  
Clinton by telephone and by letter, but did not say how Moscow 
would respond if attacks were carried out. Washington replied that 
NATO had a right to use force. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign ministers Hubert Vedrine of France and Robin Cook of  
Britain, co-hosts of the peace conference, showed up at the talks 
Wednesday for the fourth time since negotiations began 12 days ago 
in the chateau in Rambouillet, outside Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is some movement,'' Cook said. ``But that movement needs  
to pick up a lot of speed if it is going to complete its work with 
a successful agreement on Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At stake in the talks is the future of Kosovo, the poor southern  
province of Serbia where 90 percent of the population is ethnic 
Albanian. An estimated 2,000 people have died and hundreds of 
thousands have been driven from their homes in a year of conflict 
between Serbs and independence-seeking Kosovo Albanians. Serbia is 
the main republic in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Key to any Kosovo peace agreement is the deployment of some  
30,000 NATO troops to the province to implement the deal. Belgrade 
has so far refused to allow such a force on Yugoslav territory. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, there were indications Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic might be bending. Serbian President Milan Milutinovic was 
coming back to the talks, and an independent Belgrade newspaper 
said Thursday that Milosevic might consider allowing foreign troops 
in Kosovo -- if there were no Americans involved. 
</P>
<P>
	French President Jacques Chirac opened the talks here Feb. 6,  
warning both sides to make peace for the sake of Europe, but talks 
have dragged and international mediators put most of the blame on 
the Serbian side. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the dispatch of NATO troops, the proposed  
agreement calls for disarming the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, 
something KLA spokesmen have said they will never accept. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook insisted, however, that the KLA must disarm.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have made that clear to the Kosovo Albanians,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	Most diplomats here don't seem to take Milosevic's ``no'' to  
troops as final. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior American official in Washington, speaking on condition  
of anonymity, said if the Serbs agree to the NATO force, an 
extension of the talks beyond the Saturday deadline might be 
considered to clear up unresolved issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav Deputy Premier Vuk Draskovic indicated Wednesday that  
if the Americans and Europeans were to lift remaining sanctions on 
Yugoslavia and restore the country's membership in international 
organizations, that could help make a deal in Rambouillet.

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Peace Talks Inch Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- With time running out and NATO  
pressure heightening, mediators at the Kosovo peace conference 
presented rival Serbs and ethnic Albanians today with a ``final 
version'' of a political settlement for the embattled province. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Hill, the U.S. diplomat who is the chief mediator  
here, said comments from both sides were incorporated in the 
document. Both sides had been sent ``a kind invitation to consider 
it as a final version,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs and ethnic Albanians are up against a Saturday noon  
deadline to reach a deal. If they don't, NATO has threatened to 
launch airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is indeed a compromise,'' Hill said of the document.  
``There are people on both sides who are unhappy with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to get this by noontime on Saturday,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana warned that the alliance  
was prepared to act quickly if the clock runs out on the deadline 
imposed by the six-nation Contact Group -- the United States, 
Russia, France, Britain, Germany and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do hope very much that the parties are thinking about the  
consequences if they do not reach an agreement,'' he said today in 
the Macedonian capital, Skopje, with Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme 
NATO commander in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has ordered an additional 51 planes to Europe  
to beef up forces already on standby for action in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters today during a  
Seattle visit that the additional planes would begin arriving in 
Europe this weekend and would be ready for a possible attack by the 
middle of next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Richard Bridges, a Pentagon spokesman, said the fresh  
deployment demonstrates ``a clear commitment that time is running 
out'' on the Serbs to negotiate, although NATO military action 
might not happen right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an automatic 12:01, the bombs fall,'' Bridges  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian President Boris Yeltsin, however, warned the United  
States that Moscow ``will not allow Kosovo to be touched.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rap star ODB was arrested for allegedly  
wearing a bulletproof vest -- a no-no because of his previous 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	The rapper, whose real name is Russell Jones, was driving  
erratically when he was pulled over Tuesday night, Officer Mike 
Partain said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't have a driver's license, so the officers had him  
step out of the vehicle and noticed he was wearing body armor,'' 
Partain said. ``A check found he had prior violent felony arrests 
and he was taken into custody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 30, was booked for investigation of possessing body  
armor. He could get up to three years in prison. He was released on 
$18,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	His prior run-ins with the law include allegations that he fired  
at police, threatened to kill his ex-girlfriend, shoplifted a pair 
of shoes and failed to pay child support. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sailor, Rescuer Tell of Ordeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Stranded inside her yacht's overturned,  
watertight cabin, Isabelle Autissier rode 30-foot swells and 
patiently waited more than a day as fellow Around Alone skipper 
Giovanni Soldini cut through 200 miles of winds and 40-degree water 
to rescue her. 
</P>
<P>
	After Autissier floated downwind in a life raft and climbed  
aboard the Soldini's yacht, the Frenchwoman warmed up and enjoyed 
some wine with her Italian rescuer, the two said Wednesday in a 
satellite telephone interview with the race's World Wide Web page 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't realize Giovanni would come so early,''  
Autissier said, explaining why she had fallen asleep when he 
arrived. Soldini said he sailed around Autissier's capsized boat 
screaming, ``Isabelle, Isabelle!'' 
</P>
<P>
	He finally found a hammer in his cabin and threw it against her  
boat's inverted hull. The thud woke Autissier, who popped out of an 
escape hatch in the stern. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier, now a passenger on Soldini's boat, was halfway  
between New Zealand and Cape Horn, the southern tip of South 
America, when a huge wave hit the boat, causing the computer system 
to malfunction and the boat to tip over. 
</P>
<P>
	Race rules say Soldini will get credit for the 24-hour diversion  
and rescue and he will not be penalized for having Autissier on 
board as long as she does not help him sail. On Thursday, 
Solidini's boat, Fila, had fallen more than 500 miles behind race 
leader Marc Thiercelin. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier said she was in the cabin of her boat, PRB, when it  
began to roll. She tried to climb above-deck and ease the sails to 
reduce the tilting force of the winds. But as the boat continued to 
roll, she ducked back into the cabin just in time to close the 
watertight hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time I was totally surprised,'' she told a reporter for  
the Quokka sports network. ``I tried to go into the cockpit but the 
boat was already more than 90 degrees (heeled over) and I couldn't 
get into the cockpit. It was too dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini received word of Autissier's troubles after he woke up  
Monday and checked his e-mail. ``There was no question,'' he said 
when asked about his decision to search for his friend. 
</P>
<P>
	For almost 24 hours he battled strong head winds to reach  
Autissier's position. He scaled his mast to peer above the swells 
that reached 30 feet and still could see nothing until he was 
almost alongside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I start to get really, really worried because visibility is  
not very good and you feel that the sea is very big and you feel 
very stupid,'' Soldini said. 
</P>
<P>
	He began a mile-square search grid. Soldini said he had gone a  
mile one way and come back, and when he went to turn again, ``I saw 
it -- the keel, then the boat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters say more high winds and waves could toss the  
skippers about still further as they sail toward Punta del Este, 
Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are big winds coming, but it won't last too long,''  
Soldini said. ``So I don't think it will be too dangerous.''

<HEADLINE> Detlef Schrempf To Seek Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Seattle Supersonics' veteran Detlef Schrempf told  
a German newspaper Thursday that he plans to apply for U.S. 
Citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very likely. The papers have been laying around for a  
long time,'' the German-born forward and former NBA All-Star, told 
the mass-circulation Bild. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old also said he has considered returning to Germany  
at the end of his NBA career and playing for his country's top 
club, Alba Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``But to live in another country than America, even it is  
Germany, for an extended time isn't that simple,'' said Schrempf, 
who attended high school and college in Washington and is married 
with children. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempf has enjoyed a 14-year career with Dallas, Indiana and  
Seattle and is one of the best known foreign players in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	If Schrempf changes citizenship, that would end German hopes  
that the best basketball player the country ever produced would 
rejoin their national team for an Olympics or major championship. 
</P>
<P>
	After Thursday's practice, Schrempf said he was in no rush to  
become a U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably will at some point, but there's nothing imminent,''  
he said. ``It might not happen for the next five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempf's wife, Mary, is a former hurdler on the West German  
national team. He played for the 1992 German Olympic team and was a 
member of the 1984 West German Olympic team.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Tighter Currency Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of a visit from French President  
Jacques Chirac, the Clinton administration threw cold water on his 
proposal to link the world's major currencies as a way to prevent 
future global currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said while the idea of creating  
more stability between the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen and the 
new European euro was appealing in theory, the practical problems 
of doing it were ``enormous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Chirac said he planned to use his Washington visit to  
promote the French currency stability plan in meetings Thursday 
with officials at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank 
and in discussions Friday with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world financial system needs to be improved because the  
world has changed,'' Chirac said in an interview in Paris with The 
Associated Press and Associated Press Television News. ``We should 
not accept too large'' fluctuations in currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	While France has received support for its ideas from Germany and  
Japan, the plan is unlikely to advance given the strong opposition 
of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Washington meetings, the idea will be on the  
agenda when Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan meet 
with their counterparts from the world's largest economies in Bonn, 
Germany, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the disagreement over currency alignment proposals,  
Rubin said the Group of Seven nations -- the United States, Japan, 
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- were committed to 
overhauling the global financial architecture to prevent future 
Asian-style currency crises from occurring. 
</P>
<P>
	While Brazil was rocked earlier this year when it was forced to  
devalue its currency, there are a number of signs that some Asian 
nations are beginning to stabilize after steep downturns. The 
crisis began in Asia in July 1997 and leveled the Russian economy 
last August, triggering major turbulence in U.S. and other world 
markets and prompting the Fed to cut interest rates to restore 
calm. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-7 finance officials are expected to endorse two smaller  
proposals on Saturday to promote greater disclosure of foreign 
currency reserves among countries and to create an informal forum 
where countries can discuss voluntary ways to improve their 
regulation of financial institutions, including banks, brokerage 
houses and hedge funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. economy has continued to expand at healthy rates  
despite the global turmoil that has sent America's trade deficit 
soaring, increasing protectionist pressures as American 
manufacturers and farmers suffer from the loss of overseas markets 
and a flood of cheaper imports into this country. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the ``international system cannot sustain  
indefinitely'' such huge trade imbalances and he called on Japan 
and Europe to do more to stimulate domestic growth and serve as 
markets for troubled economies. 
</P>
<P>
	While the French have not totally spelled out their views on how  
major currencies could be better aligned, one major idea being 
explored would be to create bands for the major currencies with 
commitments by countries to intervene by buying and selling 
currencies on the open market to maintain those exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rubin told reporters Wednesday that ``bands become wonderful  
speculative targets for those who are worried about speculation'' 
as traders test government's resolve to spend their reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists are split on the idea of establishing a more  
stable currency trading system. Many argue that a government's 
efforts to maintain a fixed currency level are destined to be 
overwhelmed by the size of the global currency market where $1.5 
trillion is traded daily. But some analysts insist it is critical 
that some system be established to tame current volatility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have learned a lot in the past two years about the dangers  
of unfettered markets,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, economist at the 
Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington think tank. ``We have got 
to find a way to slow massive capital flows down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the Bonn meeting is expected to also call for further  
discussions among G-7 countries and developing nations at a 
conference in Germany in mid-March and a follow-up meeting in 
Washington in April.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars Hope Brady's the Answer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A white, stretch limousine pulled up  
to Alltel Stadium early Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of it climbed Kyle Brady, the newest member of the  
Jacksonville Jaguars and now the highest-paid tight end in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars signed Brady to a five-year, $14.4 million offer  
sheet earlier in the week. When his old team, the New York Jets, 
said Wednesday they would not match the price for their transition 
player, it was time to secure the limo and break out the champagne 
in Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	And so, Brady went from one AFC contender to another -- trading  
in Bill Parcells and New York for more money and much better 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had this team not been in the running last year, I would have  
thought twice about coming here,'' said Brady, who caught 30 passes 
for 315 yards and five touchdowns last season in his best year as a 
pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to put myself in a situation where if the Jets  
matched the offer, I'm happy, but if the Jets don't match the 
offer, I'm in just as good a situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Including a $4 million signing bonus, Brady's contract averages  
$2.88 million per season, just more than what Shannon Sharpe of the 
Denver Broncos makes. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady got the big money thanks in part to Jacksonville coach Tom  
Coughlin, who has made the Jaguars one of the most aggressive teams 
each year in free agency, especially early in the signing period. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Brady, the Jaguars had signed defensive lineman Gary  
Walker to a five-year, $18 million deal and Carnell Lake to a 
four-year, $18 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaguars senior vice president Michael Huyghue said this is  
obviously the time for the Jaguars -- who went 11-5 and won the AFC 
Central last season -- to be aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear what our goals are,'' he said. ``We could have been  
more cautious and said let's bring back the team and try to win 11 
or 12 games. But we've never been comfortable with that 
mentality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brady's contract was structured to count $1.3 million against  
the 1999 salary cap. The Jaguars still have $3.2 million left under 
the cap and are expected to pursue linebackers and defensive 
linemen with the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady's signing came as something of a surprise, considering  
Jacksonville was expected to concentrate fully on a defense that 
finished 25th in the league last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, in Brady, they get a fifth-year, 6-foot-6, 268-pound  
player who Coughlin has liked since scouting him during his senior 
year of college at Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin thinks Brady's frame is perfect for the run-blocking  
schemes he uses and feels he'll give the Jaguars a throwing option 
down the middle of the field unlike any they've had. 
</P>
<P>
	``His confidence level is up, his production is up,'' Coughlin  
said. ``He's got to continue to develop in the passing game. But I 
think his best football is yet to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The signing means the Jaguars have likely seen the end of Pete  
Mitchell, one of the original Jaguars and always considered as true 
a ``Coughlin guy'' as there was. 
</P>
<P>
	Before coming to Jacksonville, Coughlin coached the tight end at  
Boston College. One of his first moves was to bring Mitchell to the 
Jaguars in a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	He caught 166 passes for 1,845 yards over four seasons,  
including 38 for 363 yards last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin said he would take the transition tag off Mitchell and  
allow him to test himself in the free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the kid and he's the kind of guy who it's very, very  
difficult to think about not having around,'' Coughlin said. ``But 
we have to move on with our system. That's what we do here. We 
evaluate and go on from there.''

<HEADLINE> Pistons Waive Macon, Moore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Pistons on Thursday  
waived guard Mark Macon and forward-center Mikki Moore, then signed 
free-agent guard Corey Beck. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the Beck's contract were not immediately disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2, 195-pound guard had played for Sioux Falls of the  
Continental Basketball Association, averaging 13.5 points, four 
assists and three rebounds in eight games. During the 1996-97 
season, Beck was named the CBA's top defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck had been in training camp with the Vancouver Grizzlies, but  
was waived Jan. 28. In 59 games for the Charlotte Hornets last 
season, he averaged 3.2 points, 1.7 assists and 1.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Macon and Moore had been free-agent invitees to the Pistons'

<HEADLINE> RJR Chair Outlines Top Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The top official at RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.  
says finding a way to make its international tobacco business 
bigger and more competitive is the company's top priority for the 
first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Steven Goldstone, the chairman and chief executive of the  
No. 2 U.S. tobacco company, declined in a private meeting with 
analysts on Wednesday to say whether a joint venture, selling the 
business or some other transaction was the most likely course. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Wright, a spokesman for the New York-based conglomerate  
that makes Winston and Camel cigarettes, said Goldstone also 
indicated no spinoff was imminent of RJR's 80.6 percent stake in 
Nabisco Holdings Corp., maker of Oreo cookies and Planters nuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstone's appearance before a securities analysts' group in  
Naples, Fla., came as financier Carl Icahn is again pressing RJR to 
proceed with spinning off the remaining Nabisco stake to RJR 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn disclosed in a filing this week with the Securities and  
Exchange Commission that he boosted his stake in RJR to 7.7 percent 
from 5.6 percent late last year, buying 3.6 million shares between 
Jan. 26 and Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	He is considering filing a slate of nominees for the board and  
has until March 12 to do so. Icahn failed three years ago in a 
similar proxy fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said Goldstone told the analysts he was not managing the  
company based on the possibility of a proxy fight for control from 
Icahn or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstone has previously indicated that RJR's international  
tobacco business isn't big enough to compete on its own and is 
looking for a transaction that would ``enhance the scale'' of the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts say a sale of the business is the most likely  
course, and analyst Martin Feldman of Salomon Smith Barney has 
estimated the business is worth about $5.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said Goldstone told the analysts he has been talking with  
a number of companies and interested parties about the 
international tobacco business and that the discussions have given 
him ``a sense of comfort'' that something can be done within six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstone also told the analysts that last fall's agreement,  
under which the major tobacco makers agreed to pay $206 billion 
over 25 years to settle 46 states' claims for the costs of treating 
sick smokers, gave him more flexibility to pursue ways to enhance 
the value of RJR. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he was exploring the options, but wasn't going to give  
any specifics,'' Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman suspects Goldstone may be considering selling all or  
part of the food business stake rather than spinning it off to RJR 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said Goldstone indicated he didn't think a spinoff of the  
food business stake was imminent. The company has said the legal 
environment isn't right for a spinoff. 
</P>
<P>
	A spinoff could draw suits by people who feel it would  
improperly diminish the remaining company's ability to pay health 
claims involving smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	David Adelman, analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said that  
despite the settlement with the states, tobacco companies still 
face a class-action suit in Florida on behalf of smokers, the 
possibility of a federal lawsuit for health costs tied to 
smoking-related diseases and union health fund claims for health 
costs reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
	But Feldman said a sale of the food business would be different  
because it would generate money for RJR and defeat claims that the 
deal had left the tobacco company in a weaker financial state. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, RJR shares  
fell 18 3/4 cents to $25.81 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Charlotte Event To Lose Sponsor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- The Indy Racing League's top promoter is  
preparing to lose the title sponsor of the event held at its track 
in suburban Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Speedway Motorsports Inc. is making plans to compensate for the  
expected loss of VisionAire Corp. as the top sponsor of the May 1 
race at Lowe's Motor Speedway, sources told The Associated Press on 
Thursday on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd hate to see them pull out, but I'm not worried about it  
from the standpoint of being able to race. We can make up for it,'' 
said SMI president H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler, whose company owns the 
tracks on which five of this year's 11 IRL races will be run. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler said SMI had not been officially notified that  
VisionAire is withdrawing its sponsorship but was ready to seek new 
backers if the contract is terminated. 
</P>
<P>
	VisionAire is entering the final year of a three-year contract  
to be the title sponsor of a 500-kilometer race at Lowe's, a deal 
worth about $500,000 annually. But sources told the AP that IRL and 
SMI officials have begun to refer to the 1999 event as the 
Charlotte 500 and not the VisionAire 500 because they don't expect 
the company to back this year's race. 
</P>
<P>
	When a two-day tire test for IRL cars ended at the speedway  
Thursday night, the track issued a news release on the session in 
which the upcoming race was repeatedly referred to as the Charlotte 
500. VisionAire was not mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an approach is premature, according to VisionAire, a  
Chesterfield, Mo.-based manufacturer of what it calls entry-level 
corporate jet airplanes. Company spokesman Steve Goodhue said there 
have been discussions recently about the status of the sponsorship 
but no decision has been made to withdraw it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still from our perspective the title sponsor of the  
VisionAire 500,'' Goodhue said Thursday night. ``It has been a 
tremendous venue for us the last couple years and we certainly have 
recognized some benefits from it. It is our intention to continue 
to be the title sponsor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Losing VisionAire could mean six of this year's 11 IRL events  
would be run without title sponsors. Four of those races are at SMI 
tracks, including events at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Texas Motor 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wheeler said individual race sponsorship is not his primary  
concern for the fledgling circuit, which last year acquired the Pep 
Boys auto parts chain as its title sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler said the addition of Pep Boys and other sponsors to the  
IRL, as well as improvements in cars, safety and the size of race 
fields, have boosted his image of a circuit that has struggled to 
attract fans. The inaugural VisionAire 500 drew a 
larger-than-expected crowd of more than 73,000 in 1997, but 
attendance slipped to about 50,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you've got a startup deal, you're going to have little  
things that will happen and big things that will happen. You've 
just got to look over all of it and put your head down and keep 
going and look at the long-term picture,'' he said. ``And I'm 
extremely optimistic this year -- much more so than I was last year 
-- about the whole Indy Racing League.''

<HEADLINE> Deal Set for Lewinsky TV Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under an arrangement with Kenneth Starr's  
office, Monica Lewinsky can answer a wide range of questions in her 
upcoming television interview, legal sources familiar with the 
agreement say. 
</P>
<P>
	The former White House intern cannot make statements to ABC  
interviewer Barbara Walters that go beyond what Ms. Lewinsky has 
already told the grand jury and Starr's office in numerous meetings 
about her relationship with President Clinton, said the sources, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some other restrictions dealing with specific areas of  
Starr's ongoing criminal investigation, the sources said Thursday 
after several days of discussion between Starr's office and Ms. 
Lewinsky's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewinsky interview will be aired during ``sweeps'' week  
which ends March 3, the critical ratings period on which network 
advertising rates are based. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly did not return phone calls  
seeking comment. ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy declined to comment, 
as did Lewinsky spokeswoman Judy Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal came as Starr's staff continues to experience some key  
departures, even as his criminal investigation continues. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr deputy Solomon Wisenberg departs next month to become a  
partner at a private law firm. Wisenberg conducted much of the 
grand jury questioning of witnesses in the Lewinsky investigation 
and questioned Clinton extensively in the president's videotaped 
grand jury testimony. Starr deputy Robert Bittman already has left 
the office. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr deputies Hickman Ewing and Jackie Bennett remain, along  
with a staff of prosecutors who are preparing for three trials in 
the next four months. The trials are against longtime presidential 
friend Webster Hubbell, the Clintons' ex-Whitewater partner Susan 
McDougal and a Virginia woman, Julie Hiatt Steele, who is involved 
in Starr's investigation of whether the president made an unwanted 
sexual advance against former White House volunteer Kathleen 
Willey.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Changes May Save Billions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Savings from Medicare changes that a  
government panel is considering would be only modest at first and 
depend on the assumption that private-sector competition can help 
reduce health-care costs for the elderly and disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	But eventually, Medicare could save up to $850 billion a year,  
according to preliminary estimates by the staff of the National 
Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's chairman, Sen. John Breaux, D-La., released the  
report late Wednesday, under increasing pressure from commission 
members who want to know how Medicare's finances would be affected 
by a plan Breaux is trying to rally the panel around. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has less than two weeks until its March 1  
deadline to recommend changes to Congress and President Clinton. 
Without changes, Medicare is expected to be financially overwhelmed 
in coming decades by millions of aging baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Breaux's plan, Medicare would help the elderly and  
disabled buy private health insurance so the government can begin 
shifting away from paying individual medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
	While tentative support exists for the idea, enough  
commissioners still have serious misgivings that it is not yet 
assured of being included in the panel's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent analysis of the plan by congressional and Clinton  
administration auditors is not yet complete. 
</P>
<P>
	But the study by commission staff found that it could slow  
expected growth in Medicare costs by about 1 percent a year -- a 
modest amount that would compound over time. By 2030, Medicare 
would save $475 billion to $850 billion annually -- a 20 to 30 
percent reduction in projected program costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Estimates of the long-run savings from Senator Breaux's  
proposal are dependent on the ability of a competitive system to 
reduce annual growth rates in Medicare spending,'' however, the 
staff report said. 
</P>
<P>
	While private health insurance prices traditionally have risen  
more slowly than Medicare costs, some commissioners have questioned 
how much of that difference could be due to the older, sicker 
population Medicare serves. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the preliminary analysis of Breaux's plan does not include  
one potentially expensive item that the commission still is 
seriously considering: adding prescription drug coverage, which 
Medicare does not now include. 
</P>
<P>
	The analysis included, however, a proposal to raise the Medicare  
eligibility age from 65 to 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary estimates found that while potentially reducing  
overall Medicare expenses, Breaux's plan would not help postpone a 
shortfall expected in 2008 in the special payroll taxes that are 
meant to cover a significant share of Medicare's costs -- mainly 
those associated with hospital stays. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, lawmakers have considered that a key measure of any  
Medicare reform proposal's success. But the report noted that 
Breaux's plan would eliminate some traditional distinctions in how 
different parts of Medicare are financed.

<HEADLINE> EPA Seeks Big Cut in SUV Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to dramatically cut air pollution in  
the next decade, the Environmental Protection Agency is set to 
propose tough new requirements for cleaner cars and gasoline, 
including a dramatic reduction in pollution from popular sport 
utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft proposal could be sent to the White House for review  
as early as Friday, according to government sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed regulations, which would go into effect in 2004,  
have been the subject of intense lobbying by both the auto and oil 
industries and could shape the kind of cars Americans will drive 
over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, automakers would be required to make popular  
sport utility vehicles, which along with other light trucks account 
for nearly half the market, as pollution-free as passenger cars, 
according to sources familiar with the general outline of the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, the largest SUVs would be given additional time  
to comply, however, according to one source, who like others who 
discussed the proposal, did so under conditions of not being 
further identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA also plans to require oil companies to dramatically  
reduce the amount of sulfur in gasoline sold nationwide. The 
low-sulfur gas will have to contain on average 30 parts per million 
sulfur. Outside of California, gasoline today has more than 10 
times that amount in most parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA officials declined to comment on the draft proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	Industry sources and environmentalists, some of whom had been  
briefed on the proposed rules, said that they largely mirror the 
tougher emission requirements already planned in California, 
beginning in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	That would include a reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions from  
cars from the current 0.4 grams per mile to 0.05 grams per mile in 
2004. The automakers already have committed to cutting these 
emissions to 0.2 grams per mile under a national low-emissions 
vehicle program beginning in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists said tailpipe releases of hydrocarbons and  
nitrogen oxide, both sources of urban smog, would be cut by as much 
as 90 percent from levels required today outside California. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision will dictate how clean cars will be in the first  
decades of the 21st century,'' said Michelle Robinson of the Union 
of Concerned Scientists. Most important, she added, is that for the 
first time it will mean sharp reductions in emissions from SUVs, 
which, along with pickups and minivans, account for nearly half of 
the vehicles sold today. 
</P>
<P>
	William Becker, executive director of the association  
representing state air pollution control officials, said the 
tougher emission controls on both cars and SUVs will be essential 
if states are to meet future air quality mandates. 
</P>
<P>
	The cleaner gasoline alone is equivalent to taking 54 million  
cars off the road, said Becker, adding that the tougher tailpipe 
standards will be like removing an additional 50 million cars by 
the year 2020. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules have been the focus of fierce lobbying by both the  
auto and oil industries. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, auto executives, meeting with EPA officials,  
argued that while they're ready to dramatically cut emissions on 
cars and many of the smaller and mid-size SUVs, they should be 
given more time, and face less stringent standards, for the larger 
SUVs such as the Ford Expedition and Chevy Suburban. 
</P>
<P>
	``We told them we can do most of what you want, but just can't  
get as low or as fast as you want'' on the larger sport utility 
vehicles, said one auto executive who has been involved in the 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	The large SUVs are among the best sellers in showrooms. Last  
year they accounted for 28 percent of the SUVs sold, compared to 24 
percent a year earlier, according to Ward's Automotive, which 
tracks auto industry sales. 
</P>
<P>
	According to sources, the EPA may still give some flexibility to  
automakers on meeting the tougher emission standards for the larger 
SUVs as long as manufacturers meet their overall fleet averages. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil executives said the cleaner low-sulfur gasoline would cost 5  
to 6 cents a gallon more to produce. The more stringent tailpipe 
emission requirements may add $160 to $200 to the cost of a car, 
according to EPA and California state agency estimates.

<HEADLINE> Winter Sports Want Say in Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMSAU, Austria (AP) -- Winter sports officials want a major role  
in choosing Winter Olympic host cities, the president of the 
International Skiing Federation said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to take over power, but we think it's the only  
way to restore the credibility of the International Olympic 
Committee,'' FIS president Gian-Franco Kasper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has been shaken by a corruption probe into cash, lavish  
gifts and other inducements for IOC members and their relatives 
before the 1995 vote that awarded the 2002 Winter Games to Salt 
Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC and the national Olympic committees have been quite  
hurt and damaged and they need to change their structures. They 
have lost their credibility,'' Kasper said on the eve of the Nordic 
Skiing World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven winter sports federations want to take the leadership  
role in restoring the IOC's credibility, Kasper said. He said 
sports criteria should count for 50 percent in choosing the future 
sites of Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The federations and the IOC's evaluation commission, which makes  
recommendations to the IOC on bidding cities, should also have a 
50-percent say in the final decision and should preselect two 
candidates from which the final host city would be chosen, Kasper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter for the IOC but we think it would help them  
restore their credibility if the selection was based on sporting 
criteria,'' Kasper said. ``Until now, the IOC has had no criteria, 
no system. The evaluation commission has been there for only five 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Basing the decision on sporting criteria would ``make it much  
less possible to have corruption,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current system, Olympic cities are selected by a vote  
of the entire IOC membership. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasper said FIS would make its proposal official at the  
emergency IOC session next month, where delegates will vote on 
possible changes in the selection of the 2006 Winter Games site. 
</P>
<P>
	Six European cities are bidding for the 2006 Games, due to be  
awarded at an IOC session in June.

<HEADLINE> Mariners' Buhner Works Out at First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Jay Buhner, coming off major surgery on his  
right elbow, was at first base Thursday for the Seattle Mariners' 
first workout of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Buhner's goal is to start the season in left field, but he was  
working at first under the tutelage of regular first baseman David 
Segui. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want Jay around David as much as possible during spring  
training,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``David will be the best 
teacher we have here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Segui and Buhner worked on the side because position players  
don't officially report until Tuesday. Mariners pitchers and 
catchers reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a challenge, but big league players thrive on  
challenges,'' said Buhner, a former All-Star and Gold Glove right 
fielder. ``I want to see how good I can be at that position 
(first). It certainly makes for a more interesting spring 
training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buhner has made such strides in his rehabilitation that Piniella  
might try him in left field. But Piniella wants to bring him along 
slowly this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Jay is healthy, what I would like to see us do is have him  
play at first base when we rest David,'' Piniella said. ``We want a 
flow of keeping everybody rested and everybody playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Segui said he has made one suggestion to Buhner: Wear a  
protective cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's right,'' Piniella said. ``The ball gets over there in a  
hurry.''

<HEADLINE> FAA Orders Older 727s Inspected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One thousand older Boeing 727s must receive  
inspections after fatigue cracks were found in the cabins of four 
such planes operating in the U.S. commercial airline fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration, which issued the  
airworthiness directive on Thursday, said the finding was an 
outgrowth of the aging aircraft program begun with the aviation 
industry in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The program is designed to ensure that aircraft remain as  
structurally sound throughout their service life as they were when 
they were originally certified. 
</P>
<P>
	The order applies to Boeing 727-100, -100C, -200, -200F, and  
727C aircraft, airplanes that have an engine on each side of the 
tail cone and one built into the tail itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The average age of the aircraft is 25 years, or about 38,000  
flight cycles. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators must perform repetitive visual inspections of portions  
of lower skin lap joint -- an area where overlapping sections of the 
plane are joined -- within 15 days or 50 flight cycles, whichever 
occurs first. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspections must be performed prior to accumulation of  
40,000 total flight cycles. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, repetitive low frequency eddy current inspections  
must be performed within 60 days or 300 flight cycles to detect 
potential small cracks in the fuselage. Eddy current inspections 
are electronic examinations used to detect cracks not visible to 
the eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide, 1,516 Boeing 727s are affected by the airworthiness  
directive, 1,000 of which are U.S.-registered. Foreign carriers do 
not have to comply with FAA orders, but international civil 
aviation authorities usually heed each other's safety warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic carriers using the affected planes are American  
Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, DHL Airways, 
Express One, Federal Express Corp., Kitty Hawk Inc., Northwest 
Airlines, Ryan International Inc., Trans World Airways, United 
Airlines, United Parcel Service and US Airways. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated cost for the visual inspections is $960 per  
aircraft, or $960,000 for the fleet. The estimated cost for the low 
frequency eddy current inspections is $1,920 per aircraft, or $1.9 
million for the fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of optional internal visual and high frequency eddy  
current inspections is estimated at $3,600 per aircraft, or $3.6 
million for the fleet.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Slip / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices slipped today following an  
overnight drop on Wall Street. The dollar gained against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 11.88 points,  
or 0.08 percent, to close at 14,146.79. On Wednesday, the average 
closed down 73.97 points, or 0.52 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.68 yen in late trading, up 0.06 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 119.02 
yen overnight. It traded between 118.40 and 118.95 yen throughout 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei average finished slightly lower  
on profit-taking triggered by Wednesday's drop on Wall Street, 
where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 101.56 points to close 
at 9,195.47. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. market tumbled and at this moment investors are  
taking profits after the Bank of Japan decided to ease monetary 
policy,'' said Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Japan's central bank lowered a key interest rate to  
help bolster the nation's flagging economy. That action, Nomaguchi 
said, helped push the market higher earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 348 million shares changed hands today on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 400 million shares 
the day before. Declines outnumbered advances 666 to 426, while 198 
issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section shed 1.81 points, or 0.16 percent, to finish at 
1,095.27. The TOPIX closed down 4.60 points, or 0.42 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar gained strength on supportive  
comments from the Japanese Ministry of Finance's Vice Minister for 
International Affairs Eisuke Sakakibara. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as ``Mr. Yen'' for his ability to verbally influence the  
currency market, Sakakibara said the Bank of Japan's willingness to 
take radical steps to boost the economy is now ``much, much 
stronger than the market currently realizes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks were carried in today's overseas edition of the  
Financial Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami said recently it would be  
acceptable for key short-term lending rates to fall to as low as 
zero percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower interest rates make the yen less attractive to investors  
but help companies by lowering borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 133.81 yen, up from  
132.87 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.880 percent from Wednesday's finish of 
1.930 percent, driving its price up to 99.36 yen from 98.97.

<HEADLINE> EPA To Demand Cleaner Snowmobiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Smoke-belching snowmobiles and all-terrain  
vehicles are in for an overhaul. The Environmental Protection 
Agency is ready to write the first emission standards for the 
machines after finding they are the source of significant air 
pollution in some cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The machines emit 25 percent as many hydrocarbons as all the  
nation's cars and trucks put together, according to an EPA study. 
More than 66 times as many cars and trucks are in use as 
snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Due by September 2000, the new rules are likely to force  
manufacturers to redesign or replace the two-stroke engine standard 
on snowmobiles and some ATVs. The changes could add several hundred 
dollars to the vehicles' retail prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is definitely none too soon,'' said Russell Long, executive  
director of the Bluewater Network, a coalition of environmental 
groups. ``The EPA dragged their feet for many years before looking 
at these sources of pollution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Standards also will be developed for forklifts, compressors,  
generators and similar gasoline-powered equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Congress required the EPA to study motor vehicles of  
all kinds and decide whether to set or tighten emission standards. 
A lawsuit by the Sierra Club forced the agency to agree last summer 
to speed up its work. 
</P>
<P>
	Emission standards for outboard motors and personal watercraft  
such as Jet Skis go into effect in 2006. Standards also have been 
set for farm tractors and will be out soon for lawnmowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jet Skis use the same two-stroke engine as snowmobiles. Some new  
models, which cost $800 more than earlier ones, use a 
fuel-injection system that cuts emissions by 80 percent. 
Environmentalists say that isn't enough of an improvement and want 
the two-stroke engine scrapped altogether in favor of 
cleaner-burning four-stroke models. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem with the two-stroke engine is it typically burns  
only two-thirds of its fuel, spewing the rest into the air as part 
of the exhaust. The injection system helps some, but studies show 
the modified two-stroke is still at least three times dirtier than 
a four-stroke motor. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-stroke engines are preferred for snowmobiles because they  
start better in cold weather and accelerate more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	In a notice filed Feb. 8, the EPA estimated snowmobiles and ATVs  
produce 1.1 million tons of hydrocarbons a year, or 15 percent of 
all that emitted from mobile sources, including cars, trucks, 
airplanes, locomotives and lawnmowers. By 2010, that share is 
expected to rise to 19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cars and trucks produce 4.5 million tons of hydrocarbons, a  
principal ingredient in the creation of summer smog. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowmobiles and ATVs also account for an estimated 9 percent of  
carbon monoxide emissions and 2 percent of particulate matter. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA officials said they expect manufacturers to contest some of  
their findings, but the industry already is at work on new engine 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're always more than willing to work with them to meet any  
requirements they set forth,'' said Heather Hauschild, a 
spokeswoman for Arctic Cat Inc., one of the largest manufacturers 
of snowmobiles. ``All we hope is that the guidelines will be 
sensible, steps that we can meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Honda Motor Co., the biggest maker of ATVs, said in a  
statement Thursday that it is ``committed to developing practical 
and achievable emissions reductions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, environmental groups petitioned for a ban on  
snowmobiles in the national park system. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 120,000 snowmobiles enter Yellowstone National Park each  
year. The air around the park's west entrance, where they 
congregate, is sometimes thick with blue smoke. Near Old Faithful 
geyser, snowmobiles create more pollution in a weekend than a 
year's worth of automobile traffic, the environmental groups said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. sales of snowmobiles have doubled since 1992 to more than  
160,000 a year, and about 1.3 million are now in use. An additional 
1.7 million ATVs, dirt bikes, mopeds and go-carts, 20 percent of 
which use two-stroke engines, also are in use, the EPA says. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, 200 million cars and trucks are on the roadways.

</P>
<P>
	DOVER, N.H. (AP) -- President Clinton went to New Hampshire today  
to lead a panel on health care. It was his first such foray since 
his acquittal by the Senate on impeachment charges. Clinton touted 
a plan to use the projected federal budget surplus to shore up 
Social Security and Medicare. He said, ``I would very much like ... 
to take these health care issues and sort of put them beyond 
partisan politics'' Tonight, Clinton is to address the New 
Hampshire Democratic Party's 40th anniversary dinner at the 
National Guard armory in Manchester.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Baylor College of Medicine scientist says a  
London newspaper misinterpreted her study about a possible link 
between an early polio vaccine and cancer, a university spokesman 
said. Dr. Janet Butel has not proved that a monkey virus that 
contaminated an early form of polio vaccine is responsible for 
cancers in humans, said Baylor spokesman B.J. Almond. A story in 
the London Sunday Telegraph said the monkey virus in pre-1963 polio 
vaccinations was ``cancer-causing.''

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flukey price hikes in January for gasoline at  
refineries, pork at meatpacking plants and oranges at fruit growers 
temporarily pushed up wholesale costs at the fastest rate in more 
than two years. Prices paid by wholesalers to producers jumped 0.5 
percent, the most since October 1996, the Labor Department said 
today. Economists saw it as a one-time hike and said little will 
get passed on to consumers.

<HEADLINE> Output of 4 Japan Auto Makers Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Fewer cars were produced at four of the nation's  
top five automakers in January, as the recession continued to 
dampen demand, the companies announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co., Honda Motor Co. and Mazda  
Motor Corp. all reported lower domestic production figures compared 
to the same month a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Motors Corp. cited the only production increase, as  
the company raised its output of passenger vehicles, particularly 
mini-cars. The company's January output increased 0.5 percent to 
86,562, rising for the first time in two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota's output tumbled 14 percent to 229,119 vehicles in  
January, Nissan's dropped 5.6 percent to 118,407, Honda's fell 9.5 
percent to 95,054 and Mazda's declined 13 percent to 63,055. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda's domestic sales in January, however, rose 10 percent to  
38,019, led by strong demand for its Life mini-vehicle. A Honda 
spokesman said that although production fell, sales rose as the 
company likely drew on December inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association  
announced that Japan's total auto production for 1998 fell 8 
percent to 10.05 million vehicles, the first contraction in three 
years.

<HEADLINE> EPA Is Sued Over Gene-Altered Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A coalition of environmentalists and organic  
farmers filed a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency 
today to force the agency to end its approval of a type of 
genetically altered crop. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court by Greenpeace  
International, the Center for Food Safety and the International 
Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements charges EPA with 
``wanton destruction'' of Bt, which it calls the ``world's most 
important biological pesticide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These crops are an environmental disaster waiting to happen,''  
said Kalee Kreider, a Greenpeace spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The complainants are concerned that using the pesticide in  
genetically altered plants poses environmental risks. They complain 
that EPA has failed to address their concerns since approving the 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA approved the use of Bt in potatoes in 1995 and has since  
agreed to its use in corn and cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit demands that EPA cancel registration of all  
genetically engineered Bt plants; cease approval of any new Bt 
plants and immediately perform an environmental impact assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bt is actually a soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, that  
produces toxins to kill insects. It has been used for years as a 
spray by farmers and gardeners who like the fact that it kills 
insects while remaining nontoxic to mammals. 
</P>
<P>
	But the use of Bt has changed in recent years with advances in  
genetic engineering. Scientists are now able to develop plants that 
contain a gene for Bt toxin, giving the crops built-in protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The move has been controversial, however, as many groups have  
raised concerns that insects will become resistant to Bt, which 
would seriously hurt organic farmers who are permitted to use Bt 
insecticides as their only emergency pest control option. 
</P>
<P>
	``EPA has shown a blatant disregard for federal law and its own  
regulations by approving Bt crops without fully assessing their 
environmental safety,'' said Joseph Mendelson, legal director of 
the Center for Food Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Rissler, a senior scientist with the Union of Concerned  
Scientist, charged, ``Resistant insects may have already evolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An EPA spokesman disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``EPA carefully makes sure that the biotech products we review  
fully comply with all legal requirements designed to ensure that 
they are environmentally sound and environmentally beneficial,'' 
said spokesman Dave Cohen. ``We believe the actions we've taken 
with regard to Bt will be sustained against this legal challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Jim Gerritsen, a plaintiff and potato grower from Maine,  
contends, ``Genetically engineered Bt crops will lead to insect 
resistance in just a few years. My ability to provide consumers 
with quality organic produce should not be compromised for the 
short-term benefit of the biotech industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organic farmers are also concerned that pollination will move  
genetically engineered products into their crops, whether they want 
them to or not, Mendelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the bottom line is the EPA should have done its  
homework on these plants before they registered them,'' Mendelson 
said. ``They didn't do that. They didn't look at the adverse 
environmental impacts that this stuff creates.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Panel To Study Metal Bats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- The NCAA on Wednesday named a panel  
of scientists and sports experts to study the risks associated with 
metal baseball bats. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA Baseball Research Panel will meet March 11-12 in  
Indianapolis and report back to the organization's Baseball Rules 
and Executive committees. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA in January adopted rules to make metal bats perform  
more like wooden ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes, which take effect Aug. 1, limit the size of the  
bat. The rules make the bats narrower and are intended to make sure 
the ball does not leave the bat at any greater speed than 93 mph. 
The bats being used now send the ball into the field at speeds of 
up to 113 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's findings will be used to help the NCAA decide  
whether to fine-tune those rule changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``All NCAA rules committees have a clear responsibility for  
minimizing risk and maintaining the integrity of their sports,'' 
NCAA executive director Cedric Dempsey said. ``Fortunately, college 
baseball has been a relatively safe sport. We want to keep it that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The board's chairman is California State University-Fullerton  
president Milton Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Other members are James Ashton-Miller, a research scientist in  
mechanical and biomedical engineering at the University of 
Michigan; Michael Carroll, a professor of engineering at Rice 
University; Kenneth Johnson, a professor of physics at Southern 
Illinois University; Dave Keilitz, executive director of the 
American Baseball Coaches Association; Richard Rasmussen, executive 
secretary of the University Athletic Association; and Bryan Wesley 
Smith, head team physician at the University of North Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane's Names Retired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Georges and Mitch, hurricanes that battered  
the Gulf of Mexico and Central America last year, are about to have 
their jerseys retired. 
</P>
<P>
	When a hurricane has a devastating impact on a country its name  
is dropped from use, explained Arthur J. Dania, director of the 
weather service of Netherlands Antilles and Aruba. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty sure two names, Georges and Mitch, from last year  
will be retired,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	That would bring the total of names retired over the years to  
49, beginning with Carol, which battered North Carolina, New York 
and parts of New England in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitch certainly qualifies as devastating, claiming thousands of  
lives in Central America when it stalled last October, pouring 
record rains on Honduras and Nicaragua. The resulting floods were 
so powerful that maps are having to be redrawn to reflect the new 
contours of the land. 
</P>
<P>
	Georges blasted across parts of the Caribbean in September,  
striking Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Cuba before crossing 
the Florida Straits to Key West. It then skirted the west coast of 
Florida before making landfall near Biloxi, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Replacement names will be chosen at the end of March at a  
meeting of the hurricane committee of the World Meteorological 
Organization's Regional Association IV, Dania said. 
</P>
<P>
	The regional Association, which he heads, represents 25  
countries ranging from Canada to Colombia and Venezuela and 
including the nations of the Caribbean and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane naming is but a small part of the association's work,  
Dania stressed, noting it helps national weather services share 
information and forecasts and issue warnings to protect people. 
</P>
<P>
	But storm names are usually the first contact with hurricanes  
for ordinary people, who hear the name on radio or television or 
read it in a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Atlantic Basin six sets of names are used in rotation.  
That means Mitch and Georges would be returning in 2004 if they 
were not retired and replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's tropical storms will reuse the list from 1993,  
beginning with Arlene and, if there are enough storms, running 
through Wilma. 
</P>
<P>
	Infamous retired hurricane names include Hazel, 1954; Camille,  
1969; Agnes, 1972; Frederic, 1979; Hugo, 1989; Bob, 1991; Andrew, 
1992 and, most recently, Hortense, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricanes, technically known as tropical cyclones, are given  
names to prevent confusion when more than one storm is under way. 
</P>
<P>
	This was first done by an Australian forecaster, who used the  
names of politicians early in this century. That provided the 
opportunity for such weather reports as ``Jones causing great 
distress'' or ``Smith wandering aimlessly in the ocean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Military forecasters took over the naming in World War II,  
usually using the names of their wives or girlfriends. For two 
years the military phonetic alphabet was used -- Able, Baker, 
Charlie etc. -- but in 1953 the U.S. Weather Bureau went back to 
women's names. 
</P>
<P>
	After women began complaining about the practice, the list of  
names was changed in 1979 to alternate male and female names. 
</P>
<P>
	While Dania said he has heard no proposals to change the current  
practice in this region, countries of the Western North Pacific and 
South China Sea are taking a new approach starting in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 countries in that region have approved a new list of  
tropical storm names, 10 from each country, to be coordinated by 
the Hong Kong Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
	The names cover a wide range including Nakri, a type of flower  
in Cambodia; Haishen, a Chinese sea god; Kai Tak, the former Hong 
Kong airport; Pabuk, a big freshwater fish in Laos; Parma, a dish 
of ham, liver and mushrooms popular in Macao; Ewinlar, a Chuuk 
storm god in Micronesia; Cimaron, a Philippine wild ox; Durian, a 
Thai fruit; and Conson, a mountain in northern Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Sport Federations Support Samaranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- The world's sports federations, led  
by the highest-ranking Olympic official implicated in the Salt Lake 
City bribery scandal, declared support Thursday for IOC president 
Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling council of the General Association of International  
Sports Federations called for the Olympic movement to ``maintain 
unity'' to overcome the biggest crisis in its history. 
</P>
<P>
	``During this difficult period .... GAISF's Council publicly  
announces its support and its trust within the International 
Olympic Committee and its president Juan Antonio Samaranch,'' a 
statement from the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement called on all parties to act in a ``calm and  
collected manner'' to help the Olympics ``get back on the tracks of 
progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GAISF is headed by Kim Un-yong, the powerful South Korean  
member of the IOC executive board and one of 24 IOC members linked 
to alleged misconduct in Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim was cited in separate investigations by the IOC and the Salt  
Lake independent ethics panel. He has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAISF statement was the second show of support for Samaranch  
by a major sports organization in two days. On Wednesday, the 
summer sports federations -- headed by track and field chief Primo 
Nebiolo -- said Samaranch is ``exceptionally qualified to navigate 
the IOC through these troubled waters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have numerous calls from outside the IOC, particularly  
from the media, for Samaranch to resign in connection with the 
widening corruption scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, some of the corporate sponsors who finance the  
Olympics have been critical of Samaranch while stopping short of 
demanding his resignation.

<HEADLINE> Nirtgage Rates Rise for Third week / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages rose slightly for the third consecutive week, 
Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The average rose to a five-week high of 6.82 percent from 6.77  
percent the week before and a six-week low of 6.74 percent at the 
end of January. It's remained below 7 percent since mid-June and 
reached a 31-year low of 6.49 percent in early October. That helped 
send sales of both new and existing homes to record highs last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The slightly rising interest rates (this year) may be the  
element that slows the housing boom,'' said economist Robert Van 
Order of Freddie Mac. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 6.46 percent this week, up from 6.40 percent and also a 
five-week high. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.67 percent, an eight-month high and up 
from 5.58 percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged 1 percent of the loan amount for all three types of 
mortgages.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prepares for Serbia Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dramatizing a threat to bomb the Serbs, the  
Clinton administration is adding 51 U.S. warplanes to an already 
powerful attack force in Europe to pressure the Yugoslav government 
to approve a self-rule plan for Kosovo and to accept NATO 
peacekeeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be in a position to carry out an air operation,  
should it be requested,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said on 
his arrival early this morning in Seattle on unrelated business. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen told reporters the additional planes -- 12 Air Force F-117  
stealth fighter-bombers, 10 EA-6B electronic warfare planes and 29 
refueling planes -- would begin arriving in Europe this weekend. He 
said they would be ready for a possible attack by the middle of 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen declined to say where in Europe the extra planes would be  
based. Aviano air base in Italy is one possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The purpose of sending more warplanes is to heighten the threat  
of force and thereby intimidate Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic into accepting a six-nation plan to end a yearlong 
conflict between Serb troops and secession-minded ethnic Albanians 
in Kosovo, a province in the dominant Yugoslav state of Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Milosevic has defied the United States and five allied  
governments who have given him until noon Saturday to agree to pull 
most Serb troops out of Kosovo and see them replaced by some 28,000 
NATO peacekeepers, including about 4,000 U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
	While his Serb negotiators at Rambouillet, France, are showing  
some interest in the self-rule plan for the Albanian-majority 
Serbian province, Milosevic is defying the United States and its 
partners on the peacekeeping operation that would clear the way for 
a local police force to take charge in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now the Kosovars appear to be willing to sit down and  
negotiate some kind of agreement,'' Cohen said. ``He (Milosevich) 
does not at this point. So we are going to put the forces in place 
to at least prepare for taking action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in Washington Cohen warned that the Serbs faced ``swift  
and severe'' consequences'' if they persisted in rejecting a NATO 
peacekeeping force in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Demanding that Milosevic change his mind by noon Saturday, James  
P. Foley, the State Department's deputy spokesman, said: ``If it 
would take some military action to force Mr. Milosevic to his 
senses, so be it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen's order directs that the planes depart U.S. bases within  
the next 48 hours. The dozen F-117s will depart from Holloman Air 
Force Base, N.M. Five of the 10 EA-6B planes are at Whidbey Naval 
Air Station, Wash., and five are at Cherry Point Marine Corps Air 
Station, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The additional planes bring to 260 the number of U.S. aircraft  
that would be available for any NATO strikes against Serbia, Cohen 
said. Additional U.S. aircraft, including bombers, have been 
ordered to a standby position in case they are needed, he added. 
Cohen said B-52s and possibly B-2 stealth bombers could be called 
into action for the attacks, which also could involve hundreds of 
planes from other NATO countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The tactic is similar to the military pressure applied against  
Iraq last year to try to wear down President Saddam Hussein into 
permitting unfettered U.N. inspections of suspect weapons sites. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana has had authority since  
Jan. 30 to order airstrikes against the Serbs and is not required 
to consult alliance members again, Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a practical matter,'' however, Solana probably would talk  
to the United States and possibly other allies before ordering any 
bombardment, the U.S. spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration took the tough line after Milosevic  
was approached in Belgrade and rejected a NATO peacekeeping force 
in Kosovo as part of a settlement to end conflict between Serb 
troops and ethnic Albanians seeking to pry the province away from 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, unable to sway Milosevic  
in a telephone call Tuesday, is weighing a decision whether to 
intervene in the negotiations again. 
</P>
<P>
	She and five foreign ministers set the deadline last weekend in  
Paris, but the Serbs have not budged on their opposition to NATO 
peacekeepers being sent to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley said the door remains open for Milosevic to yield to the  
demands of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and 
Russia. Together the six nations comprise the so-called Contact 
Group that oversees the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not see the issue as closed,'' he said. ``President  
Milosevic still has time to see the light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Foley said some progress in the negotiations has been made  
on other issues, and lawyers are working on texts of an accord to 
end the yearlong Kosovo conflict that has claimed 2,000 lives and 
routed some 300,000 people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Serb side is dealing with the prospect of a peace  
agreement,'' the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Milosevic's defiant ``no'' on NATO peacekeepers, the  
British and French foreign ministers also detected some progress. 
</P>
<P>
	And Vuk Draskovic, the Serbian deputy prime minister, said the  
Serbs would accept a ``just agreement'' provided it eased economic 
and political sanctions on Yugoslavia, such as a ban on its 
participation in international financial organizations.

<HEADLINE> California Shopkeeper Ordered To Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- A shopkeeper whose store has been  
picketed since he flaunted a poster of the late communist leader Ho 
Chi Minh has been ordered to move out by today or face further 
legal action. 
</P>
<P>
	Truong Van Tran's landlord served him with a notice that cites  
failure to provide proof of property insurance, worker's 
compensation insurance or liability insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran's store has been the site of protests since mid-January  
when he made an issue of his window display showing Ho and the 
Vietnamese flag. Most of the Little Saigon community's 200,000 
residents are former political prisoners or refugees who despise 
the communist government. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge last week upheld Tran's constitutional right to display  
the artifacts in the window of his store. Tran's landlord had told 
him to remove the picture and flag because they were sparking 
disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
	During the latest protest outside the store on Wednesday, a half  
dozen of the 150 protesters turned on a Vietnam veteran who had 
come to oppose the demonstration. The attackers pushed and shoved 
him to the ground, and at least one man stomped on him. He was not 
seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (protesters) gave their country away,'' said veteran  
Thomas Kochler, as a small trickle of blood dripped from his head. 
``We never let it go while we were there, but when it was their 
turn they ran.''

<HEADLINE> Rivera Beat Yankees in Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	New York Yankees players not only beat other teams, they beat up  
on their own, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariano Rivera made it 2-0 for Yankees players in salary  
arbitration when he was awarded $4.25 million Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arbitrator James Duff, who heard the case Wednesday in Tampa.,  
Fla., decided against the team's offer of $3 million. Combined with 
the $5 million Derek Jeter won Tuesday and Thursday's acquisition 
of Roger Clemens, the Yankees' payroll increased to $86,715,000 for 
21 signed players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised, only in the fact that our number made Mariano  
the highest paid three-plus closer in the history of the game by 
$750,000,'' Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said. ``If that's 
not fair, I don't know what is. What are you going to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owners are 6-2 in arbitration this year, losing only to Rivera  
and to Jeter, who was offered $3.2 million offer by the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a wild week,'' Cashman said. ``From a personal  
standpoint, Brian Cashman alone, it was a bad week for the 
arbitration situation. It's hard for me to swallow because I'm a 
competitive person. You get paid to make decisions and you live by 
them and held accountable for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera, who took over from John Wetteland as New York's closer  
in 1997, was 3-0 with a 1.91 ERA and 36 saves in 41 chances last 
season, when he made $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman said he would examine the roster to see if the payroll  
can be cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's something that makes sense, I'll have to consider  
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the final three cases were argued Thursday, with  
Baltimore catcher Charles Johnson and Cincinnati pitcher John Hudek 
going before three-man panels. The final case is scheduled for 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who won in arbitration last year, asked arbitrators  
Anthony Sinicropi, James Duff and Mort Mitchnick for a raise from 
$3.3 million to $5.1 million, with the Orioles offering $3.6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old catcher hit .218 for Florida and Los Angeles  
last season with 19 homers and 58 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudek was 5-6 with a 3.09 ERA in 58 relief appearances for the  
New York Mets and the Reds last year, striking out 68 in 64 
innings. He asked arbitrators Stephen Goldberg, Roger Abrams and 
I.B. Hellburn for a raise from $499,000 to $1.3 million. Cincinnati 
argued for $800,000.

<HEADLINE>  Lawyers Defend Suspect's Tattoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Defense attorneys tried today to show that  
racist and satanic tattoos on a man accused of dragging a black man 
to his death were intended to help the defendant survive in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination, Jasper police officer Rich Ford  
acknowledged that the symbols on John William King's skin could be 
interpreted in different ways, but insisted they were meant to 
express values and beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some may have expression of love and some may have expression  
of hate,'' Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also acknowledged motivation for the tattoos could be  
meant to intimidate other inmates who might prey on a 5-foot-7 
white man in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the eye of the beholder,'' defense attorney Brack  
Jones told him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, sir,'' Ford replied.  
</P>
<P>
	King is accused of murdering James Byrd Jr. last year by  
chaining him to the back of a pickup truck and dragging him for 
nearly three miles along a bumpy asphalt road, dismembering his 
body. If convicted, King could face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other men, Lawrence Brewer, 31, and Shawn Berry, 23, also  
are charged and are to be tried later. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are portraying King as so hateful he proudly adorned  
his body with dozens of bold and intricate racist tattoos. He 
obtained most of them while he was in prison for a burglary 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	One depicts the lynching of a black man while others show  
Nazi-type SS lightning bolts, a satanic star and the sign of a 
white supremacist group and the words ``Aryan Pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously you can't commit a crime this heinous unless you've  
got a lot of hate and anger in your heart,'' prosecutor Guy James 
Gray said Wednesday after introducing photo of King's tattoos into 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Devils and monster faces and skulls and things like that are  
pretty consistent with somebody having a lot of hate in their 
heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King's attorneys had objected to the tattoo photos, saying the  
art was constitutionally protected as freedom of expression. State 
District Judge Joe Bob Golden overruled the objection. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've got a hanging black man on your arm, you're more  
likely to commit a crime against a black person,'' Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, an ex-girlfriend of King testified she saw him  
ride away in a gray pickup truck with Brewer and Berry. Prosecutors 
contend Byrd was chained to the truck an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray has said he believes the Byrd slaying was intended as a  
stunt to draw attention to a new white supremacist group King was 
forming in Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he hoped to complete the state's case by Friday.

<HEADLINE> Boston Accused in Housing Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Minority children beaten. Broken car windows  
and slashed tires. Human excrement placed outside apartment doors. 
Racial epithets spray painted on walls. 
</P>
<P>
	All were part of a pattern of racial and ethnic harassment by  
some white public housing residents against black and Hispanic 
neighbors that Boston housing officials knew existed yet didn't 
remedy, Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the Boston Housing Authority has become the  
nation's first city housing agency to be accused of ``systematic 
discrimination'' by the federal Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (Boston) authority did not protect these families,'' Cuomo  
said. ``We can't allow families to be terrorized by racial and 
ethnic harassment that prevents them from living in any home in any 
neighborhood in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from a three-year investigation of alleged  
racial and ethnic harassment of nine minority families in the 
Bunker Hill and Old Colony public housing developments from 1992 to 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Mayor Thomas Menino said Wednesday that the charges  
unfair. He said federal housing officials failed to acknowledge 
recent changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Boston Housing Authority is run much differently than it's  
ever been in the past,'' said Menino. ``These are the days you 
wonder what somebody's agenda may be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both developments, located in predominantly white areas of  
Boston, had been targets of integration efforts by public housing 
officials since the late 1980s, Cuomo said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the nine families, with a total of 25 children, appeared  
at the news conference nor were they identified by HUD officials. 
But Cuomo said the harassment included beating minority children, 
placing human waste outside apartment doors, firing a BB gun into a 
child's bedroom, breaking car windows, slashing tires, setting 
fires outside one resident's apartment and verbal and written 
ethnic and racial slurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo said Boston officials failed to take action to protect the  
families and move them to safer developments. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Housing Authority Administrator Sandra B. Henriquez said  
in a faxed letter that the Boston authority has shown a 
``commitment to fair housing and civil rights'' since launching a 
Civil Rights Protection Plan in June 1996 to address racial 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo said his department is conducting a 30-day review of  
whether Boston housing officials have properly implemented the 1996 
plan. A HUD special counsel will recommend to Cuomo whether 
additional sanctions against the Boston authority, ranging from 
withholding or reducing federal funding to monitoring and providing 
technical assistance, are needed.

<HEADLINE> Labor Leaders Debate 2000 Campaigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Organized labor leaders are pledging  
more than $40 million to mobilize voters for the 2000 elections in 
an effort that will primarily help Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	A measure approved by the AFL-CIO executive council at its  
winter meeting here requests each affiliate union to donate $1 per 
member -- about $13.5 million a year for two years -- to mobilize 
union voters. Coupled with political money in regular budgets, the 
federation's spending for 2000 campaigns would total $40 million to 
$46 million, union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what we raise, we will be out-raised by the business  
community 10 to 1,'' said Gerald McEntee, president of the American 
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Hatch, executive director of the GOP House campaign  
committee, said the labor federation's action ``should be a wake-up 
call to every working American and every business owner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't participate in the 2000 election cycle, the  
liberal elite and unions will attempt to buy the next Congress to 
install their agenda of backroom politics,'' Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	McEntee told reporters after the private vote that none of the  
AFL-CIO money will go to candidates or political parties. The money 
will pay for telephone banks, flyers at workplaces, newsletters, 
mailings and television advertising to educate union and minority 
voters about key legislative issues in a drive that will start 
almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Such grassroots efforts almost always benefit Democrats over  
Republicans. ``Winning back the House is a big goal,'' McEntee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor spent nearly as much money in the 1996 presidential  
election cycle. But this time the effort is starting a year 
earlier, creating a continuous campaign cycle for labor's political 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action:  
</P>
<P>
	--Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley appears before the  
executive council today, hoping to persuade organized labor to hold 
off endorsing presidential candidates. He wants time to prove he 
can beat Vice President Al Gore, who is pushing for an early 
endorsement as the party's front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior AFL-CIO official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said the endorsement likely won't be settled before the fall. Two 
AFL-CIO affiliates already have endorsed Gore, but he is not 
popular with industrial unions. Bradley's standing is no better, 
but it could improve if Gore started to look vulnerable, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Even as they talked boldly about winning back the House for  
Democrats, some union leaders said they won't shy away from 
supporting moderate Republicans who support their issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're certainly aware of who our friends are,'' Teamsters  
President James P. Hoffa said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hillary Rodham Clinton was a popular topic of discussion in the  
bars and hallways of the resort hotel that hosted the meeting. A 
longtime adviser, Harold Ickes, was quietly gauging support for a 
possible Senate bid in New York. New Jersey Sen. Robert Torricelli, 
head of the Democratic Senate campaign committee, was said to be 
urging labor leaders to encourage her to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she has some pretty good credentials to be elected to  
the Senate,'' AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said.

<HEADLINE> Fiat To Acquire Majority of Renault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TURIN, Italy (AP) -- Fiat SpA subsidiary Comau SpA will acquire  
51 percent of Renault SA's fully owned Renault Automation, the two 
companies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiat will have an option to buy the remaining 49 percent between  
2002 and 2004, but other financial details won't be released until 
the two groups sign a final agreement, expected in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Comau, which is 65 percent-owned by Fiat, had 1998 revenues of  
$928.5 million, while automobile assembly company Renault 
Automation had sales of around $115 million. The Renault unit 
derived 85 percent of its sales from business with its parent 
company or with PSA Peugeot Citroen, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement is the third in recent months between the two car  
and truck makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The two pooled their bus-making operations into a 50/50 joint  
venture, renamed Iris.bus, which became operative Jan. 1 after an 
accord in May. It expects sales of $1.25 billion in 1999, and a 27 
percent share of the European bus market. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Fiat and Renault agreed to pool their foundry  
operations, with Fiat owning 66.5 percent of a company which will 
have 1999 sales around $1.87 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Such deals have helped fuel speculation, regularly denied by  
both companies, that they could seek a full-fledged merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the two could cooperate more on truck and other  
specific operations, but that there is too large an overlap in 
their car model ranges for a merger to be very feasible, 
particularly since both operate in labor markets where layoffs are 
difficult to undertake.

<HEADLINE> 'Comeback' Clinton Returns to N.H. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the White House said, there is something  
special about New Hampshire for President Clinton -- and not just 
the comeback he claimed in defeat seven years ago. It is where he 
put on national display the traits that led to his impeachment and 
the survival talents that got him through it. 
</P>
<P>
	So it was fitting coincidence that Clinton's first political  
outing since the Senate acquitted him was to New Hampshire on 
Thursday. First to Dover, where the 1992 candidate had conceded 
that he was on the ropes over his personal, not his public life, 
and then to Manchester to raise funds for the Democrats who helped 
him withstand that crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took a chance on him and I think he's repaid that trust  
with his performance in office,'' said Paul Begala, then a campaign 
strategist, now a White House adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reminders that Clinton's personal behavior had once  
again threatened his undoing -- the ``disgrace'' editorial on the 
front page of the conservative The Union Leader, the protesters 
with their ``shame'' placards in Dover. 
</P>
<P>
	But only on the sidelines.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a popular myth that he survived in New Hampshire, or  
indeed survived today, because of his political talent, which is 
manifest,'' Begala said. ``My view is that he's surviving, then and 
today, because of his ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about if he can deliver a speech, it's if he can  
deliver a program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But speeches, skilled television performances, sometimes  
contrition, sometimes confrontation, and artfully dodging denials, 
all were part of the campaign course that saved Clinton's 
presidential campaign in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	And the setting was New Hampshire, where the governor of  
Arkansas moved onto a national stage, and collided with scandalous 
sex accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	The denials that got him through that were worded as trickily as  
his defense in the Monica Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``The story is not accurate, the story is just not true,''  
Clinton said after Gennifer Flowers claimed a 12-year affair with 
him. Under oath, in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, Clinton 
admitted that they'd had illicit sexual relations in 1977. Once, 
though, not in a long affair. 
</P>
<P>
	She had been calling him periodically, with her tape recorder  
running, in late 1991 and early 1992. Clinton said he talked with 
her because she was in distress as the pursuit by the tabloids. He 
also said, incongruously, that he had told her ``to just tell the 
truth.'' She'd earlier taped his suggestion that if everybody 
denied an affair, no problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Six years later, deceptively denying sexual relations with Ms.  
Lewinsky, the president glared into the television cameras: ``I 
never told anybody to lie. Not one single time. Never.'' His 
impeachers tried, and failed, to prove otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's New Hampshire campaign also was shaken by draft  
avoidance of his youth, unfolded in installments that shook his 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd come to New Hampshire leading in national surveys of  
support for the Democratic presidential nomination, and ahead in 
state polls for the opening primary election. The late Paul 
Tsongas, former senator from next-door Massachusetts, was his 
closest rival, and as the Flowers and draft episodes unfolded, 
Clinton's lead faded. Tsongas moved ahead in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton asked for a second chance, saying he was suffering for  
his personal life, not for anything he'd done in office. ``I'm on 
the ropes because people questioned my life, after years of public 
service,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He got second place. Tsongas won the primary, 33 percent to  
Clinton's 25 percent. But by then, Clinton's managers, Begala among 
them, had figured out how to spin victory from the kind of defeat 
that had undermined national front-runners before. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of conceding defeat as a loser, Clinton would preempt  
the stage before the vote count was done. The closest he came to 
conceding was to say that he'd proved he could take a punch. 
</P>
<P>
	``New Hampshire tonight has made Bill Clinton the comeback  
kid,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying so made it so. He'd wait two more weeks to win a primary,  
but little more than a month later, Clinton effectively clinched 
nomination.

<HEADLINE> Giants Close In on Kerry Collins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New York Giants have had  
``productive'' talks with Kerry Collins and are close to a deal 
with the quarterback that reportedly would cost Danny Kanell his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	Leigh Steinberg, Collins' agent, on Thursday said he expects  
negotiations on a contract for the free agent to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been in discussions the last few days and they are  
ongoing,'' Steinberg said. ``Kerry visited over the weekend and had 
a good chance to spend some time with coach Jim Fassel, and he did 
get to meet briefly with the owners. He had a real productive and 
interesting visit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to an ESPN report that the signing is imminent and  
Kanell would be waived, Steinberg said, ``They know more than I 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Giants spokesman Pat Hanlon:  
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't signed anybody and haven't made any announcement to  
that effect. ESPN is reporting it. We don't have any comment on the 
report at this time. I'm not disputing what they're reporting, I'm 
just telling you we don't have any comment on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, 26, had a troubled career with the Carolina Panthers,  
who made him the fifth overall pick in the 1995 draft. He was 
released on Oct. 13 after telling Dom Capers -- then the Carolina 
coach, but since fired -- that he didn't have the heart for pro 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost immediately signed by New Orleans, he continued to  
struggle. Collins returned with the Saints to Carolina two weeks 
later and was booed loudly all game. He was arrested a few hours 
later for driving while impaired. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints waived him after the season.  
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said he thinks the Giants could be a good fit for  
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	``New York is intriguing from his standpoint, because he grew up  
in Pennsylvania and went to Penn State,'' Steinberg said. ``I've 
often thought and told Kerry the best football job is quarterback 
of the Giants if they are winning, with the tremendous depth of 
their fan base and the intensity, simply because of their 
location.''

<HEADLINE> Taxes Are Taking More Time Than Ever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It takes more than 22 hours for a taxpayer who  
itemizes deductions and has some investment income to finish this 
year's required Internal Revenue Service forms, the tax agency 
estimates. That's three hours longer than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. tax code now stands at more than 1.5 million words and  
climbing thanks to 1,260 changes enacted by Congress and signed by 
President Clinton in the last two years alone. 
</P>
<P>
	For this year's filing season, the IRS had to develop 11 new  
forms and revise 177 others. 
</P>
<P>
	All this has happened at a time when the same politicians voting  
for the changes are advocating tax simplification. Make the code 
simple enough that returns for most Americans would be the size of 
a postcard, say flat tax advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	But for millions of taxpayers trying to do their taxes by April  
15, the complexity is so daunting they are almost forced to seek 
professional help or a computer software program. A new ad campaign 
by H&AMP;R Block sums up the fear factor: ``We Know. Do You?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major culprit is the trend in the Clinton administration and  
Congress to enact tax credits for various social needs and to 
tinker with such intricate areas as taxes on capital gains from 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time there's a new benefit, it requires an additional  
line to the form and additional forms to compute those credits,'' 
said Sheldon Schwartz, national tax forms and publications director 
at IRS. ``It's never as easy as we would like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for politicians, the appeal of a tax break far outweighs  
such worries. 
</P>
<P>
	``People will push the complexity into the background,'' said  
Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., a senior member of the tax-writing House 
Ways and Means Committee. ``The credits are politically expedient 
and attractive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, some taxpayers for the first time can get a $400  
credit for children under age 17 and two education credits -- the 
Hope and Lifetime Learning credits -- that provide up to $1,500 and 
$1,000 respectively for certain postsecondary education expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds relatively simple. But taxpayers claiming the child  
credit must complete an 11-line worksheet, and depending on the 
answers, a second 10-line form to determine if they qualify under 
the income limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The education credits require completion of an 18-line form and  
come with their own book of instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	Another area of difficulty is IRS Schedule D, where investors  
must report their capital gains or losses from investments. Even 
small-scale investors must fill out the 54-line form and navigate 
its confusing maze of tax rates for different investments -- which 
changed dramatically in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Most forbidding of all is the alternative minimum tax. Intended  
to prevent the wealthy from escaping taxes through deductions and 
credits, it now threatens more and more middle-class taxpayers 
because its thresholds were never indexed for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	This means millions of taxpayers could be required to calculate  
both their regular taxes and their alternative minimum taxes -- and 
pay the higher of the two. That means completing a 12-line IRS 
worksheet to determine if a taxpayer is affected by the alternative 
tax and then a 50-line form to figure out the amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who mistakenly believe the alternative tax doesn't apply  
to them could get an unwelcome surprise from the IRS if they don't 
do both calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	For accountants, tax software firms and preparers such as H&AMP;R  
Block, this uncertainty means big business. The Block ``We Know'' 
ad campaign is aimed at giving people confidence that their taxes 
are being done right, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it really means is there are more opportunities to save  
money,'' said Linda McDougal of the Kansas City-based firm, which 
last year did one-seventh of all individual income tax returns. 
``To take advantage, you may need the help of a tax professional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leading tax software, TurboTax from San Diego-based Intuit  
Inc., sold 3.3 million copies last year. Buyers ``are looking to a 
trusted source for advice and to help them do their taxes,'' said 
Monica Muilenburg, director of product marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite talk in Congress of simplification, it doesn't appear  
likely anytime soon. Clinton's new budget proposes numerous credits 
for such things as care for the elderly and disabled, stay-at-home 
parents and disabled workers. Some have Republican support. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Rep. William Coyne, D-Pa., plans to introduce  
legislation that would replace the capital gains form with a single 
line and would count investment earnings as regular income. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Services estimates it will take a taxpayer  
an average of 22.7 hours to complete the 1040 form, Schedule A for 
itemized deductions and Schedule D for capital gains and losses. 
Last year, those forms took an average of 19.5 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's how the IRS figures this year's burden:  

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	Record keeping: 3 hours, 34 minutes.

for his first such political foray since his impeachment acquittal. 
He led a panel on health care and touted his plan to use the 
projected federal budget surplus to shore up Social Security and 
Medicare. ``I would very much like to see the spirit in the country 
and in Washington, D.C., that I felt here in New Hampshire so many

prepared for the announcement at Kingswood Regional High School, 
where he once taught civics. Smith, who takes it as a compliment to 
be compared to conservative Republican Sen. Jesse Helms of North 
Carolina, supports beefing up national defense, ending abortion and 
strengthening constitutional rights.

signed an order for 1,855 Marines to be part of 7,000 NATO 
peacekeeping troops in Kosovo in the hope of forcing acceptance of 
a peace plan between Serb troops and secession-minded ethnic

black man and killing him as part of an initiation rite for his 
racist gang, a former fellow inmate testified today. William 
Hoover, a convicted robber, recalled talks he and King had in 
prison. He said King told him, ``You have to spill blood to get in 
and give blood to get out, I guess.'' King, 24, is accused of 
murdering a black man, James Byrd Jr., last June by chaining him to 
the back of a pickup truck and dragging him for nearly three miles 
along a bumpy asphalt road, dismembering his body. If convicted, 
King could face the death penalty.

said. Dr. Janet Butel has not proved that a monkey virus that 
contaminated an early form of polio vaccine is responsible for 
cancers in humans, said Baylor spokesman B.J. Almond. A story in 
the London Sunday Telegraph said the monkey virus in pre-1963 polio

<HEADLINE>  'Comeback' Clinton Returns to N.H. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the White House said, there is something  
special about New Hampshire for President Clinton -- and not just 
the comeback he claimed in defeat seven years ago. It is where he 
put on national display the traits that led to his impeachment and 
the survival talents that got him through it. 
</P>
<P>
	So it was fitting coincidence that Clinton's first political  
outing since the Senate acquitted him was to New Hampshire on 
Thursday. First to Dover, where the 1992 candidate had conceded 
that he was on the ropes over his personal, not his public life, 
and then to Manchester to raise funds for the Democrats who helped 
him withstand that crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the experts expected you to send me home; instead you made  
me feel at home, and I still do,'' Clinton said Thursday as he 
reminisced with an ebullient crowd gathered at National Guard 
Armory for the fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reminders that Clinton's personal behavior had once  
again threatened his undoing -- the ``disgrace'' editorial on the 
front page of the conservative The Union Leader, the protesters 
with their ``shame'' placards in Dover. 
</P>
<P>
	But only on the sidelines.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a popular myth that he survived in New Hampshire, or  
indeed survived today, because of his political talent, which is 
manifest,'' said Paul Begala, a campaign strategist in 1992 and now 
a White House adviser. ``My view is that he's surviving, then and 
today, because of his ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about if he can deliver a speech, it's if he can  
deliver a program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But speeches, skilled television performances, sometimes  
contrition, sometimes confrontation, and artfully dodging denials, 
all were part of the campaign course that saved Clinton's 
presidential campaign in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	And the setting was New Hampshire, where the governor of  
Arkansas moved onto a national stage, and collided with scandalous 
sex accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	The denials that got him through that were worded as trickily as  
his defense in the Monica Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``The story is not accurate, the story is just not true,''  
Clinton said after Gennifer Flowers claimed a 12-year affair with 
him. Under oath, in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, Clinton 
admitted that they'd had illicit sexual relations in 1977. Once, 
though, not in a long affair. 
</P>
<P>
	She had been calling him periodically, with her tape recorder  
running, in late 1991 and early 1992. Clinton said he talked with 
her because she was in distress as the pursuit by the tabloids. He 
also said, incongruously, that he had told her ``to just tell the 
truth.'' She'd earlier taped his suggestion that if everybody 
denied an affair, no problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Six years later, deceptively denying sexual relations with Ms.  
Lewinsky, the president glared into the television cameras: ``I 
never told anybody to lie. Not one single time. Never.'' His 
impeachers tried, and failed, to prove otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's New Hampshire campaign also was shaken by draft  
avoidance of his youth, unfolded in installments that shook his 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd come to New Hampshire leading in national surveys of  
support for the Democratic presidential nomination, and ahead in 
state polls for the opening primary election. The late Paul 
Tsongas, former senator from next-door Massachusetts, was his 
closest rival, and as the Flowers and draft episodes unfolded, 
Clinton's lead faded. Tsongas moved ahead in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton asked for a second chance, saying he was suffering for  
his personal life, not for anything he'd done in office. ``I'm on 
the ropes because people questioned my life, after years of public 
service,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He got second place. Tsongas won the primary, 33 percent to  
Clinton's 25 percent. But by then, Clinton's managers, Begala among 
them, had figured out how to spin victory from the kind of defeat 
that had undermined national front-runners before. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of conceding defeat as a loser, Clinton would preempt  
the stage before the vote count was done. The closest he came to 
conceding was to say that he'd proved he could take a punch. 
</P>
<P>
	``New Hampshire tonight has made Bill Clinton the comeback  
kid,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying so made it so. He'd wait two more weeks to win a primary,  
but little more than a month later, Clinton effectively clinched 
nomination. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Slip in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen in early  
trading Friday following its strength overseas. Prices on the Tokyo 
Stock Exchange moved lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.74 yen in early trading, up 1.06 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo but slightly below its level of 119.81 yen 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average fell 54.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to  
14,092.62 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Thursday, the 
index slipped 11.88 points, or 0.08 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's strength followed its rise in  
New York, where it briefly broke through 120 yen for the first time 
since Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at 133.82 yen, up 0.02 yen from late  
Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices fell despite gains earlier on Wall  
Street mainly because of selling by institutional investors ahead 
of the March 31 fiscal year-end, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 103.16,  
closing at 9,298.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were also cautious ahead of the Group of Seven finance  
ministers meeting later in the week in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors have adopted a wait-and-see attitude ahead of the  
G-7 meeting'' to confirm the direction of the yen, said Akira 
Nakamura, manager at Chuo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 3.50 points, or 0.32 percent, to 1,091.77. 
The TOPIX had shed 1.81 points, or 0.16 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.860  
percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.875 percent, driving its price 
up to 99.52 yen from 99.40.

<HEADLINE> Philadelphia Magazine Fires Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The editor of Philadelphia magazine has been  
fired in the wake of a hoax story about a homosexual Mummers Parade 
marcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Editor Eliot Kaplan was roundly criticized for the story, which  
he said was meant to be satirical. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher David Lipson said Wednesday that the hoax, which came  
to light last week, ``had nothing to do'' with Kaplan's firing last 
week. ``However, we feel it is time for a change in direction,'' 
Lipson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The story told of a thick-chested construction worker who lives  
for New Year's Day and the parade that allows him to dress up in 
sequined camouflage and show his true colors. In fact, the whole 
thing was made up. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaplan, 42, came to the magazine seven years ago from  
Gentleman's Quarterly, where he had been the No. 2 editor. Under 
Kaplan, Philadelphia magazine won National Magazine awards in 1993 
and 1994. The publication also was nominated last year for a 
National Magazine award for general excellence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of the awards we've won, and the writers who've gone  
on to national publications,'' he said. ``I feel lucky that I'm 
part of this legacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had explained the mummer story as an attempt at satire,  
because the parade participants traditionally are macho 364 days a 
year. ``A gay mummer -- we thought it was preposterous. But maybe it 
was too real. When only 10 to 20 percent of the readers think it's 
fake ... it just didn't work. I have to apologize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mummers Parade -- comparable to the Mardi Gras festival, with  
elaborate costumes, instruments and flamboyant routines -- is the 
nation's oldest New Year's Day parade. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Fried, a senior writer at the magazine who was a  
childhood friend of Kaplan's, was named as Kaplan's temporary 
replacement and was said to be the likely permanent replacement. 
Asked about that, Kaplan replied, ``Steve was my friend for 40 
years.'' He said he meant to use the past tense.

<HEADLINE> Horse Tracks Begin Cooperating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	As the millennium approaches, cooperation among race tracks, a  
losing proposition for much of the 20th century, is becoming a 
better bet. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason is certainly the changing face of the sport, with  
dwindling on-track attendance and inroads by many other forms of 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Thoroughbred Racing Association, formed in 1998, is  
working to boost public awareness of the excitement of horse 
racing. There have been national advertising campaigns and the 
introduction this year of ``NTRA Champions On Fox,'' a series of 11 
live television stakes races, with a bonus system that could earn a 
horse a $5 million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	But more and more, racing is dependent on serious horse players,  
men and women who like their action not on, or just on, the roll of 
dice, the flip of a card or the pull of a handle, but on several 
tons of horse flesh straining and driving to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	These people can't always get to the track, or if they're at a  
track, they want to bet a horse running at another track. They 
reside in the world of simulcasting that has become the world of 
thoroughbred horse racing in the age of dot com. 
</P>
<P>
	Simulcasting allows tracks and their off-track betting  
operations in one state to wager on races on out-of-state tracks. 
It also allows patrons at one track to bet on live racing at that 
track and also on partial or full cards from other tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``About 70 percent of all dollars wagered on racing are bet in a  
simulcast environment,'' said Scott M. Finley, vice president of 
business development for Autotote Communication Services, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Bets at locations receiving simulcasts must be transmitted to  
the point where a particular race originates, and they must go 
through for simulcasting to work. Bettors don't want to hear their 
wagers were too late. 
</P>
<P>
	Transmitting bets can be expensive, especially with individual  
points each using long-distance lines. 
</P>
<P>
	So another cooperative effort in horse racing was born -- the  
North American Simulcast Racing Information Network (NASRIN), 
implemented and managed by Autotote and AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	NASRIN is roughly analogous to the Internet in that one  
connection is used to access numerous sites as opposed to requiring 
a direct line to each. The goal was to reduce dependence on long 
distance telephone calls used to transmit simulcast wagers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracks using the system ``can save in excess of 50 percent on  
transmission costs,'' Finley said. ``If 100 percent of the tracks 
used it, savings would be in excess of $20 million (a year).'' 
</P>
<P>
	As of Feb. 2, there were 115 sites on the network, including  
such major players as the New York Racing Association (Aqueduct, 
Belmont Park and Saratoga), Churchill Downs, Keeneland, Gulfstream 
Park, Hollywood Park, Oaklawn Park and Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	Finley said Autotote and AT&AMP;T have three-year contracts with  
tracks on the network and a sponsorship agreement with the NTRA. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the network is running well, but ``there's been some  
industry politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like horses, cooperation is never a sure thing in racing.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Expects D-Backs To Contend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Randy Johnson says he has no ill will  
toward the Seattle Mariners. Then again, he sure is looking forward 
to July, when the Arizona Diamondbacks play at Safeco Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully I'll get a chance to pitch in that new ballpark that  
me and the other 24 guys on that team in 1995 had a big part in 
building,'' Johnson said Thursday after his first day of spring 
training with the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona plays a three-game interleague series at Seattle from  
July 18-20, the second series at the new field. Johnson was 
reminded it might not be his turn to pitch then, but he 
half-jokingly suggested he might put a little pressure on manager 
Buck Showalter or owner Jerry Colangelo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll do some twisting of Buck's arm and maybe even Jerry's if  
I have to,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson didn't report to spring training until Thursday, the  
first day of official workouts, because he's just getting over the 
flu. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still kind of sluggish,'' he said, ``and Buck told me to  
take it easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he was in good spirits, signing autographs as he walked  
from one field to another during the workouts at Arizona's spring 
training complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he's much more at ease this spring than he was the  
previous two. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, he was coming off back surgery and was dealing with all  
the doubts about whether he would return to his old intimidating 
form. Last year, he was in a sour mood after the Mariners' decided 
against extending his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is probably going to be one of my better spring  
trainings,'' Johnson said. ``Last year, I had to deal with a lot of 
contract stuff and I'm really glad it's over and behind me. I wish 
the Seattle players and the organization the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he doesn't like to talk about his problems in  
Seattle, but he did so at length after Thursday's workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was difficult for everybody,'' he said. ``It was  
difficult for my family. The best thing for the organization and 
for me was to finally just trade me. The only thing I wish is that 
it would have been earlier in the year and things wouldn't have 
gotten the way they got, because I think things got ugly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was traded to Houston on July 31, went 10-1 for the  
Astros, then signed a four-year, $52.4 million contract with 
Arizona. He expects the second-year team to contend in the NL West 
because of the Diamondbacks' powerful starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our pitching staff is as good as anybody's in the  
National League, and probably a little deeper than most teams,'' he 
said. ``You've got six guys who can be a solid starting pitcher, 
and pitching wins games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo, who watched the workout in shirtsleeves in the  
80-degree sunshine, spent nearly $100 million to add Johnson, Todd 
Stottlemyre and Armando Reynoso to the rotation that already 
included holdovers Andy Benes and Omar Daal. The Diamondbacks also 
have another returning starter, left-hander Brian Anderson, who 
will be used as a reliever and spot starter if he isn't traded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel I'm `the' guy here,'' Johnson said. ``I didn't  
feel that I was `the' guy in Houston. I think it's safe to say that 
here there are five solid starting pitchers here, not including me. 
So the ace of the staff is whoever's pitching that day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo said he watched the workout with feelings of pride and  
accomplishment after the off-season moves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main reason I drove down here from Phoenix is to see what  
it looks like to have Randy Johnson in an Arizona Diamondbacks 
uniform,'' Colangelo said. ``It looks real good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who didn't have to hit in his 9 1/2 seasons in Seattle,  
said he will take his plate appearances seriously. He said that he 
incorporated exercises in his offseason workouts designed to help 
him swing the bat and run the bases. He's aware of the ridicule he 
received for his awkward attempts at hitting the ball after he was 
traded to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever I do on the day that I pitch I want to do to the best  
of my ability,'' Johnson said. ``I take a great deal of pride in my 
pitching, and if I'm going to be up there hitting, I want to take a 
great deal of pride in my hitting. I don't want to be some kind of 
joke up there. I realize my hitting could possibly keep me in the 
game, so I'll do whatever it takes.''

<HEADLINE>  Yanks Try To Improve on Perfection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Roger Clemens was enough to make the New York  
Yankees tinker with perfection. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if it meant giving up David Wells.  
</P>
<P>
	Even if it meant disrupting the record-setting team that won 125  
games last year and the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially if it meant getting the only five-time Cy Young award  
winner in the history of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always coveted Roger Clemens for the Yankees and New York,''  
owner George Steinbrenner said Thursday after obtaining Clemens 
from Toronto in exchange for Wells, reliever Graeme Lloyd and 
second baseman Homer Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a group of warriors here and we're getting a very  
big warrior,'' Steinbrenner said. ``He's a monster. He's just, 
`Give me the ball' -- a real competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Wells, he left the Yankees' first day of spring training  
in tears after speaking with Steinbrenner and manager Joe Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little emotional right now,'' Wells said. ``Give me a  
couple days. It's a little tough right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York and Toronto actually completed the deal late Wednesday  
night, but delayed the announcement to tell Wells in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took it like a real man. He took it better than I took  
it,'' Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boomer,'' as the 35-year-old left-hander is known throughout  
the Bronx and beyond, has been the toast of New York since pitching 
a perfect game against Minnesota at Yankee Stadium on May 17. He's 
coming off the best season of his career, 18-4 with a 3.49 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Perfection was also Mr. Personality, as far as Yankee fans  
were concerned. They loved his loud mouth and his loud music -- 
Metallica was a favorite. They loved his beer belly and the way he 
loved The Babe. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be a lot of bars going out of business in New  
York,'' Yankees pitcher David Cone said. ``He almost became a cult 
hero overnight. Last year with the perfect game, he made his mark 
in Yankees history. He can be proud of that. He won't be 
forgotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even Cone knew some fans would surely be upset.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there are mixed emotions among the fans,'' he said.  
``(But) as soon as Rocket throws his first 15-strikeout night at 
Yankee Stadium, people will be oohing and wowing, saying, `What a 
catch!' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens was as speechless as Wells, for different reasons.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to catch my breath after last night's and this  
morning's events,'' he said during a telephone conference call from 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are the champions,'' said the 36-year-old right-hander,  
who has never won a Series ring. ``I just want to slide in the side 
door and go to work with these guys and hopefully fit right in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll have to settle for No. 12 with the Yankees because No. 21  
already belongs to Paul O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
	And, so far, he's hitting it off just fine with ``Mr.  
Steinbrenner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I met my match in a guy who wants to win,'' Clemens said.  
``This guy, he settles for nothing less. I enjoy that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens is owed $16.1 million during the final two years of his  
contract and has the right to demand a trade following this 
season's World Series. However, he doesn't expect that to become an 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	While stressing that he appreciates a second chance to join New  
York, Clemens didn't second-guess choosing Toronto over the Yankees 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It worked out for me,'' he said. ``It didn't work out for the  
team. We didn't win. That's the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a 233-124 career record, Clemens went 20-6 last season  
while leading the American League in ERA (2.65), strikeouts (271) 
and tying for the lead in wins. He led in all three categories in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he won consecutive Cy Young Awards with the Blue Jays, he  
wanted out after the team's Belgium owner, Interbrew SA, decided 
not to compete with baseball's big spenders this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston and Texas were still bidding for Clemens this week, but  
the deal with the Yankees came together after Toronto dropped its 
insistence on obtaining 21-year-old shortstop Alfonso Soriano. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a horse, and he's now our horse,'' New York general  
manager Brian Cashman said. ``We're betting on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was announced as Wells and his Yankee teammates were  
just settling into their 7 1/2-week spring stay at Legends Field. 
Until Thursday, the Yankees had retained 24 of the 25 players who 
helped them win a second World Series title in three seasons, 
dropping only outfielder Tim Raines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees set an AL record for wins last year, going 114-48 in  
the regular season. New York then went 11-2 in the postseason, 
including a Series sweep of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous thing -- hopefully to get back again. Not  
that we wouldn't have that chance anyway. But it might improve our 
chances,'' Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, 124-84 in his career with a 3.96 ERA, returns to his  
first major league team. He was with the Blue Jays from 1987-92 
before he was released and moved on to Detroit, Cincinnati, 
Baltimore and the Yankees -- who signed him only after losing to 
Toronto in the bidding for Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's matured somewhat since he was with us the last  
time,'' Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash said. ``His experiences 
in other situations have made him a better pitcher. He's a smarter 
pitcher now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Yankees, the trade takes away two left-handers,  
traditionally the key to success in Yankee Stadium. But New York 
didn't lose prized prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't want to give up all our young talent. It's  
different than the old days,'' Steinbrenner said. ``Twenty years 
ago I might have said: `I don't care who we give up.' I'm smarter 
now -- a little bit smarter.''

expendable because of Chuck Knoblauch. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd, a 31-year-old left-hander from Australia, was 3-0 with a  
1.67 ERA in 50 relief appearances last year. He combined with Mike 
Stanton, Jeff Nelson, Darren Holmes and Ramiro Mendoza to form 
perhaps the best middle relief corps in baseball.

<HEADLINE>  Yanks Try To Improve on Perfection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Roger Clemens was enough to make the New York  
Yankees tinker with perfection. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if it meant giving up David Wells.  
</P>
<P>
	Even if it meant disrupting the record-setting team that won 125  
games last year and the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially if it meant getting the only five-time Cy Young award  
winner in the history of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always coveted Roger Clemens for the Yankees and New York,''  
owner George Steinbrenner said Thursday after obtaining Clemens 
from Toronto in exchange for Wells, reliever Graeme Lloyd and 
second baseman Homer Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a group of warriors here and we're getting a very  
big warrior,'' Steinbrenner said. ``He's a monster. He's just, 
`Give me the ball' -- a real competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Wells, he left the Yankees' first day of spring training  
in tears after speaking with Steinbrenner and manager Joe Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little emotional right now,'' Wells said. ``Give me a  
couple days. It's a little tough right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York and Toronto actually completed the deal late Wednesday  
night, but delayed the announcement to tell Wells in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took it like a real man. He took it better than I took  
it,'' Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boomer,'' as the 35-year-old left-hander is known throughout  
the Bronx and beyond, has been the toast of New York since pitching 
a perfect game against Minnesota at Yankee Stadium on May 17. He's 
coming off the best season of his career, 18-4 with a 3.49 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Perfection was also Mr. Personality, as far as Yankee fans  
were concerned. They loved his loud mouth and his loud music -- 
Metallica was a favorite. They loved his beer belly and the way he 
loved The Babe. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be a lot of bars going out of business in New  
York,'' Yankees pitcher David Cone said. ``He almost became a cult 
hero overnight. Last year with the perfect game, he made his mark 
in Yankees history. He can be proud of that. He won't be 
forgotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even Cone knew some fans would surely be upset.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there are mixed emotions among the fans,'' he said.  
``(But) as soon as Rocket throws his first 15-strikeout night at 
Yankee Stadium, people will be oohing and wowing, saying, `What a 
catch!' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens was as speechless as Wells, for different reasons.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to catch my breath after last night's and this  
morning's events,'' he said during a telephone conference call from 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are the champions,'' said the 36-year-old right-hander,  
who has never won a Series ring. ``I just want to slide in the side 
door and go to work with these guys and hopefully fit right in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll have to settle for No. 12 with the Yankees because No. 21  
already belongs to Paul O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
	And, so far, he's hitting it off just fine with ``Mr.  
Steinbrenner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I met my match in a guy who wants to win,'' Clemens said.  
``This guy, he settles for nothing less. I enjoy that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens is owed $16.1 million during the final two years of his  
contract and has the right to demand a trade following this 
season's World Series. However, he doesn't expect that to become an 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	While stressing that he appreciates a second chance to join New  
York, Clemens didn't second-guess choosing Toronto over the Yankees 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It worked out for me,'' he said. ``It didn't work out for the  
team. We didn't win. That's the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a 233-124 career record, Clemens went 20-6 last season  
while leading the American League in ERA (2.65), strikeouts (271) 
and tying for the lead in wins. He led in all three categories in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he won consecutive Cy Young Awards with the Blue Jays, he  
wanted out after the team's Belgium owner, Interbrew SA, decided 
not to compete with baseball's big spenders this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston and Texas were still bidding for Clemens this week, but  
the deal with the Yankees came together after Toronto dropped its 
insistence on obtaining 21-year-old shortstop Alfonso Soriano. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a horse, and he's now our horse,'' New York general  
manager Brian Cashman said. ``We're betting on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was announced as Wells and his Yankee teammates were  
just settling into their 7 1/2-week spring stay at Legends Field. 
Until Thursday, the Yankees had retained 24 of the 25 players who 
helped them win a second World Series title in three seasons, 
dropping only outfielder Tim Raines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees set an AL record for wins last year, going 114-48 in  
the regular season. New York then went 11-2 in the postseason, 
including a Series sweep of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous thing -- hopefully to get back again. Not  
that we wouldn't have that chance anyway. But it might improve our 
chances,'' Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, 124-84 in his career with a 3.96 ERA, returns to his  
first major league team. He was with the Blue Jays from 1987-92 
before he was released and moved on to Detroit, Cincinnati, 
Baltimore and the Yankees -- who signed him only after losing to 
Toronto in the bidding for Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's matured somewhat since he was with us the last  
time,'' Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash said. ``His experiences 
in other situations have made him a better pitcher. He's a smarter 
pitcher now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Yankees, the trade takes away two left-handers,  
traditionally the key to success in Yankee Stadium. But New York 
didn't lose prized prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't want to give up all our young talent. It's  
different than the old days,'' Steinbrenner said. ``Twenty years 
ago I might have said: `I don't care who we give up.' I'm smarter 
now -- a little bit smarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, a 26-year-old infielder who plays primarily at second  
base, was voted the top Yankees rookie in spring training last 
year. He hit .380 in 71 at-bats for New York but was considered 
expendable because of Chuck Knoblauch.

1.67 ERA in 50 relief appearances last year. He combined with Mike 
Stanton, Jeff Nelson, Darren Holmes and Ramiro Mendoza to form 
perhaps the best middle relief corps in baseball.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Against Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against other major currencies  
Thursday despite a decision by the European Central Bank to pass up 
a chance to lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders have been expecting the bank to lower rates again in a  
bid to stimulate economic activity and create badly needed jobs in 
Europe. A rate cut would lower the cost of borrowing, but it would 
also lower yields on the euro, making the currency less attractive 
to international investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.1200, down  
from $1.1235 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also rose against the yen, at one point breaking  
through the 120 yen level for the first time since Dec. 8. In late 
trading, the dollar was quoted at 119.81 Japanese yen, up from 
119.02 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has been rising against the yen this week following  
various moves by Japanese financial authorities to lower interest 
rates there, which had risen dangerously high. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to bring down yields on long-term Japanese bonds, a key  
benchmark for business loans, the Japanese government plans to 
issue fewer long-term bonds and resume bond purchases by an agency 
that manages pension funds. The central bank is also lowering 
short-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4281 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4222, and 1.4875 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4955. The British 
pound rose to $1.6353 from $1.6348. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7464 German 
marks, up from 1.7409; 5.8582 French francs, up from 5.8377; and 
1,730.10 Italian lire, up from 1,727.27.

<HEADLINE> Guy With Ho Chi Minh Poster Booted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- A shopkeeper whose store has been  
picketed since he flaunted a poster of the late communist leader Ho 
Chi Minh has been ordered to move out by Friday or face further 
legal action. 
</P>
<P>
	Truong Van Tran's landlord served him with a notice that cites  
failure to provide proof of property insurance, worker's 
compensation insurance or liability insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran's store has been the site of protests since mid-January  
when he made an issue of his window display showing Ho and the 
Vietnamese flag. Most of the Little Saigon community's 200,000 
residents are former political prisoners or refugees who despise 
the communist government. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge last week upheld Tran's constitutional right to display  
the artifacts in the window of his store. Tran's landlord had told 
him to remove the picture and flag because they were sparking 
disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
	During the latest protest outside the store on Wednesday, a half  
dozen of the 150 protesters turned on a Vietnam veteran who had 
come to oppose the demonstration. The attackers pushed and shoved 
him to the ground, and at least one man stomped on him. He was not 
seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (protesters) gave their country away,'' said veteran  
Thomas Kochler, as a small trickle of blood dripped from his head. 
``We never let it go while we were there, but when it was their 
turn they ran.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat, Corn Up; Soybeans Down / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat and corn futures advanced Thursday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean futures prices continued 
their retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures staged a technical recovery following early  
weakness. Market participants said the market remained under 
pressure from weak demand for U.S. grain, but prices rose amid 
commercial buying that could signal new export orders were being 
placed. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures advanced amid perceptions American farmers this  
spring would plant fewer acres to corn, helping tighten supplies. 
Prices also have been supported by generally steady export 
business, although rallies have bee stymied by fears Argentina soon 
will harvest a bumper competing crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans continued their trek lower as Brazil gets ready to  
harvest a near-record competing crop and as demand for U.S. soybean 
oil and meal remains sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.58 a bushel; March  
corn rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.15 a bushel; March oats were unchanged at 
$1.01 1/2 a bushel; March soybeans fell 4 1/4 cents to $4.82 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while feeder cattle and pork futures were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle fell .05 cent to 66.57 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .17 cent to 73.45 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell .22 cent to 45.05 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell .43 
cent to 53.72 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Study: Pesticides Too High for Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Parents face a surprising new warning: Beware of  
feeding your kids too many peaches, apples, pears and spinach. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the conclusion of a Consumer Reports study released  
Thursday that claims these healthy foods also contain pesticide 
residues that could be unsafe for young children -- and that the 
government is not doing enough about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Children subjected to the pesticides may be vulnerable to  
neurological damage, according to the findings, which offered no 
clinical proof of such harm. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in the March issue, also adds winter squash  
and green beans to the top of a list rating foods for their 
pesticide residue. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists were quick to discredit the study.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is nonsense,'' said Bruce Ames, professor of biochemistry  
at the University of California in Berkeley. Focusing on 
``minuscule'' levels of pesticide residues ``is a distraction from 
something far more important -- feeding kids fruits and vegetables 
that prevent cancer and other diseases,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Groth, an environmental biologist at Consumers Union,  
said the findings don't mean parents should stop giving their 
children produce. 
</P>
<P>
	But they ``might want to be careful about the amounts and types  
of fruits and vegetables they serve their children,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer Reports relied on data collected by the U.S. Department  
of Agriculture, focusing on 27,000 samples of 27 food categories 
tested from 1994 to 1997, both domestic and imported. The effects 
of various chemicals were assessed on how they would affect a 
44-pound child, usually an average 5-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all the foods fell within legal limits for pesticide  
residue. However, the government has stricter recommendations for 
what is officially defined as safe -- without appreciable health 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those standards, U.S.-grown peaches in the study contained  
up to 125 times the levels of the farm chemical methyl parathion 
than the government deems safe for a 44-pound child. The law allows 
twice that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Environmental Protection Agency is now implementing  
the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act, which requires it to 
reexamine all pesticides and tighten exposure limits to make them 
safer for younger children. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, parents should avoid giving their children large  
amounts of the foods with the highest toxicity scores, Groth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Produce such as apples, peaches and pears could be peeled, and  
these fruits as well as green, leafy vegetables can even be washed 
``with a very diluted dishwashing detergent,'' according to the 
Consumers Union, a Yonkers, N.Y.-based nonprofit testing and 
information-gathering organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Foods with the lowest toxicity include canned or frozen sweet  
corn, milk, orange juice, broccoli, imported bananas and apple 
juice. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also recommends buying organically grown produce,  
which Consumers Union says has little or no residue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Reports study does not examine the possible effects  
of pesticides on adults.

	Today is Friday, Feb. 19, the 50th day of 1999. There are 315  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 19, 1945, during World War II, some 30,000 Marines  
landed on Iwo Jima, where they began a month-long battle to seize 
control of the island from Japanese forces. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1473, the astronomer Copernicus was born in Torun, Poland.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1803, Congress voted to accept Ohio's borders and  
constitution. (However, Congress did not get around to formally 
ratifying Ohio statehood until 1953.) 
</P>
<P>
	In 1807, former Vice President Aaron Burr was arrested in  
Alabama. He was subsequently tried for treason and acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1846, the Texas state government was formally installed in  
Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1878, Thomas Edison received a patent for his phonograph.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1881, Kansas became the first state to prohibit all alcoholic  
beverages. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1942, President Roosevelt signed an executive order giving  
the military the authority to relocate and intern 
Japanese-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1942, about 150 Japanese warplanes attacked the Australian  
city of Darwin. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1959, an agreement was signed by Britain, Turkey and Greece  
granting Cyprus its independence. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, the U.S. Senate approved a treaty outlawing genocide,  
37 years after the pact had first been submitted for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Deng Xiaoping, the last of China's major Communist  
revolutionaries, died. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini rejected the apology of  
``Satanic Verses'' author Salman Rushdie, exhorting Muslims to 
``send him to hell'' for committing blasphemy. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: With Bosnian Serbs facing a NATO deadline to  
withdraw heavy weapons encircling Sarajevo or face air strikes, 
President Clinton delivered an address from the Oval Office 
reaffirming the ultimatum. American speedskater Bonnie Blair won 
the fourth Olympic gold medal of her career as she won the 
500-meter race in Lillehammer, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan set out for Iraq  
on a last-chance peace mission, saying he was ``reasonably 
optimistic'' about ending the standoff over weapons inspections 
without the use of force. At the Nagano Olympics, Austrian Hermann 
Maier won the men's giant slalom while Hilde Gerg of Germany won 
the women's slalom.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 43.18 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials had climbed out of an  
early slump into positive territory by midday, but the broader 
market was still languishing, as this week's sell-off in technology 
shares continued. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
43.18 at 9,238.65, after opening stronger, then dipping to a loss 
of 4.27 before recovering again. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Dow dropped 101.56, losing 95 points in the  
final hour, in a fierce sell-off led by technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators turned mixed after a shaky opening,  
with the Nasdaq composite down 1.28 at 2,247.63, and the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 composite up 6.14 at 1,230.17. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow 9-to-8 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 329.15 million 
shares, down from Wednesday's pace of 392.78 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The breadth tells me the whole story,'' said Larry Rice, chief  
investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co. ``The rallies are very 
narrow, and the sell-offs kill you. There's really been very little 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technology issues were again the lead dogs today, as they have  
been since late last week. On the New York Stock Exchange, Compaq 
was down 1 at 40in leading volume on the Big Board. Dell Computer, 
whose earnings release late Tuesday has been dragging the market 
down since last Friday, was up 15/16 at 82 1/2 in leading Nasdaq 
volume, but it was followed by Microsoft, down 4 3/8 at 145 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	But blue chips found their legs after a shaky opening. The Dow  
industrials were led higher by General Motors, up 2 5/8 at 85 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are really going after these consumer cyclicals like  
retail and autos,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment officer at 
BankBoston, but he added, ``I don't think it's a sustainable 
leadership simply because we're in the eighth year of a recovery 
and one would think the pent-up demand for things like autos has 
long been exhausted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported this morning that its Producer  
Price Index rose 0.5 percent in January, the most since October 
1996. But minus the volatile food and energy components, prices 
edged 0.1 percent lower, alleviating investors' fears that 
inflationary signals might prompt the Federal Reserve to raise 
short-term interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Papers Said To Protect Sydney Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Sydney newspapers made a secret deal  
not to report on the fawning and spending during the city's 
successful bid for the 2000 Olympics, former Olympics Minister 
Bruce Baird said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Baird, one of 15 members of the board that directed the 1993  
bid, also defended the lavish spending of the team, saying sponsors 
would have been unhappy if the committee had not done all it could 
to secure the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time we did the bid, we had an agreement from Ken  
Cowley of News Ltd., from Kerry Packer, and from John Alexander of 
The Sydney Morning Herald that they knew we would be going into a 
high level of duchessing and they were satisfied that that would be 
OK and they would not run the normal stories about it,'' Baird told 
federal parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Baird said an inquiry into the Sydney bid was politically  
motivated in the leadup to a New South Wales state election next 
month. The party that wins the elections will be in power during 
the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent investigator Tom Sheridan is due to report to the  
International Olympic Committee board March 11, but Baird said 
there was no reason for an urgent inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Six years later, here we go, we have this inquiry on,'' Baird  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe this is a political exercise. Why couldn't (Labor  
state Olympics Minister) Michael Knight wait for another couple of 
weeks until the election was over? The International Olympic 
Committee has known about these people on the take for many 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baird said the Sydney bid was expensive, but clean.  
</P>
<P>
	``Of course lobbying was important in the whole process and we  
do not apologize for the lobbying process,'' said Baird, who added 
that $12.7 million of the $17.8 million bid money came from the 
private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Manchester, England, which had also bid for the  
2000 Games, had charter flights and dinners with Princess Anne on 
offer at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``So if we are talking about duchessing, we were one of the  
minor players,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baird repeated his call for reform of the bid process, with a  
small technical committee spending no more than four days visiting 
each city. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15 members of the Sydney bid board reported no breaches of  
the IOC code in a report this week, aside from a report by Baird. 
</P>
<P>
	Baird told the IOC that an IOC member had sought inducements  
before the vote while a man claiming to act for African delegates 
also sought favors in exchange for votes. The member named by Baird 
has since resigned, former board member John Fahey said earlier 
this week.

<HEADLINE> Chirac, Clinton To Discuss Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- French President Jacques Chirac is exchanging  
ideas with President Clinton at the White House on financial and 
military matters. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders were meeting late this morning before joining  
officials from their governments at lunch. They planned a 
mid-afternoon news conference, Clinton's first since his acquittal 
on impeachment charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac's objective is to assure Clinton that even though there  
are disagreements between the two old allies on some issues, such 
as Iraq, they can reconcile differences in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the topics the two leaders will discuss are efforts to  
reform the international financial system, hit by crises over the 
past 20 months. Chirac wants to hold a monetary summit in Paris in 
the fall to adopt such reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	They also will talk about peace talks on Kosovo in France.  
Chirac has warned that if a settlement is not reached by this 
weekend, those responsible will have to bear the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Serbs are the cause of any snag, then France is prepared  
to support airstrikes against their military, French officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	France and the United States have made commitments to send up to  
9,000 troops between them to the Serbian province to police a peace 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and French officials have said Clinton and Chirac also will  
discuss NATO's 50th anniversary celebrations in Washington in 
April. France is concerned that if the meeting turns into a Cold 
War victory party, it could anger Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Chirac also differ on defining a new strategy for  
NATO operations outside the borders of member nations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Iraq, the two leaders agree President Saddam Hussein is  
responsible for the situation the country finds itself in but 
Chirac wants to lift the U.N. oil embargo, provided Baghdad agrees 
to weapons inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac spent Thursday meeting with the heads of the  
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Inter-American 
Development Bank, advancing his ideas on reforming the 
international financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech at the IMF, Chirac said awareness of the global  
economy's vulnerability to crises ``came late. It is painful. Let 
us accept the consequences and rapidly build the new financial 
architecture we so need. We know which reforms must be achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said governments and international financial institutions  
such as the IMF and the World Bank must be more open in disclosing 
economic information so investors would not head for the exits at 
the first sign of bad news from a country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must adopt a veritable 'highway code' for capital flows, a  
code that applies to all, including hedge funds and offshore 
establishments,'' Chirac said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac's trip comes ahead of a meeting Saturday in Germany of  
finance ministers from the world's wealthiest nations, who will 
discuss the same topics. 
</P>
<P>
	France wants to assure Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that the 11 European 
nations that launched a new currency last month called the euro do 
not support establishing formal target zones to ensure exchange 
rate stability among the euro, the dollar and the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead French officials envisage a system of ``enhanced  
cooperation'' to monitor dollar-euro exchange rates more closely. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said Wednesday he believed proposals to more closely link  
the dollar with the yen and the euro would probably at some point 
be at odds with U.S. domestic economic interests.

<HEADLINE> Chirac, Clinton To Discuss Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calling global economic turmoil painful,  
French President Jacques Chirac said Thursday rapid reform of the 
international financial system is essential if world growth is to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac said the international community must strengthen its  
ability to deal with crisis prevention to avoid the economic shocks 
that have swept through Asia, Russia and Brazil in the past 20 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said if world financial stability was the objective then  
constantly fluctuating currency exchange rates could not be 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Awareness of our vulnerability (to crises) came late, ''  
Chirac said in a speech at the International Monetary Fund. ``It is 
painful. Let us accept the consequences and rapidly build the new 
financial architecture we so need. We know which reforms must be 
achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the start of a two-day working visit during which he  
will see President Clinton, Chirac said governments and 
international financial institutions must become more open in 
disclosing economic information. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must adopt a veritable 'highway code' for capital flows, a  
code that applies to all, including hedge funds and offshore 
establishments,'' Chirac said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposed that the private sector become more involved in  
solving countries' financial crises rather than waiting for the IMF 
to ride in with billion-dollar rescue packages for countries in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac said France wants to host a summit in Paris of the major  
IMF members in the fall to officially adopt reforms the major 
wealthy nations may agree on at their G-7 summit in Cologne, 
Germany, in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The purpose of the Paris meeting, Chirac said, ``would be to  
officially adopt the reforms and give them international 
legitimacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to currency exchange rate policy, Chirac said shifts  
between the dollar, Europe's six-week-old euro and the Japanese yen 
will dominate the international scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``One cannot hope for world financial stability while at the  
same time accepting unstable exchange rates,'' Chirac said. ``We 
must aim for more stable relations between currencies. This is a 
daunting task.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France is anxious to convince Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin  
and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that the 11 European 
nations that have adopted the euro want closer monitoring of 
currency fluctuations but are not pressing to establish formal 
target zones to ensure exchange rate stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said Wednesday night there were enormous problems with  
setting up such zones, adding it was not the right way to go. 
Treasury officials also are skeptical about holding a monetary 
summit in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac is expected to address the same themes Friday when he  
meets with Clinton. The two leaders planned a joint mid-afternoon 
news conference, Clinton's first since he was acquitted of 
impeachment charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press before leaving Paris,  
Chirac said Clinton's acquittal was good for America and good for 
the world, which needs strong leadership from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``May I say I am very glad about it ... personally because I  
have great esteem for President Clinton,'' he said, adding that he 
did not think the scandal would damage Clinton's effectiveness as a 
world leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides global financial reform, Chirac and Clinton will review  
military issues, including Kosovo, Iraq and NATO's 50th anniversary 
summit in Washington in April. 
</P>
<P>
	France is ready to send 4,000 to 5,000 troops to the Serbian  
province to police an international agreement. Clinton has said 
he's prepared to commit up to 4,000 American troops.

<HEADLINE> Big Trade As Spring Training Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Spring training opened with a stunner today: Roger Clemens was  
traded by Toronto to the New York Yankees for David Wells, Graeme 
Lloyd and Homer Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade stunned the Yankees, coming off a record-setting  
125-win season and barely settled into Legends Field for their 
7 1/2-week spring stay in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little emotional right now,'' Wells said after meeting  
with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner at the team's training 
complex. ``Give me a couple days. It's a little tough right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens agreed to the deal, but the 36-year-old right-hander did  
not get an extension to his contract, which has two years to run 
and calls for him to be paid $16.1 million. He is to report this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roger Clemens is a non-stop Hall of Famer,'' Yankees manager  
Joe Torre said. ``The last two years, what he's done, it's 
incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, a quirky left-hander known as ``Boomer,'' was the toast  
of New York after pitching a perfect game against the Minnesota 
Twins on May 17. While he clashed with Steinbrenner and manager Joe 
Torre at times in 1997, he reached a peace with them last year and 
became one of the team's most effective pitchers with an 18-4 
record and a 3.49 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some shock in that room right now,'' Torre said of his  
clubhouse. ``It's something you have to get used to. That is what 
the game is all about. There are going to be changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going into today, New York had retained 24 of the 25 players who  
helped win its second Series title in three seasons, letting go 
only of outfielder Tim Raines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm shocked,'' Lloyd said. ``To break up the team -- it's a  
shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Mark Wohlers and Stan Belinda arrived at spring  
training eager to put aside the memories of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Supervised workouts began today -- 45 days before the Rockies and  
San Diego Padres start the season April 4 at Monterrey, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, that seems a long way off for Wohlers, who reported  
to Atlanta Braves camp in Kissimmee, Fla., on Wednesday in search 
of the strike zone and a way to revive his once promising career. 
</P>
<P>
	It was less than a year ago that Wohlers, who had 97 saves from  
1995-97, inexplicably lost the ability to throw strikes. He had a 
10.18 ERA in Atlanta, with 33 walks and seven wild pitches in 20 
1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	He tried to regain his form in the minor leagues, but that only  
made matters worse. At Triple-A Richmond, he was 0-3 with a 20.43 
ERA, walking 36 and throwing 17 wild pitches in 12 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	During the offseason, Wohlers traveled to Puerto Rico and  
California to work one-on-one with Guy Hansen, a special instructor 
for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I want to do is just get in the program and go along with  
everybody else,'' he said. ``No special treatment, no early 
workouts. People know what I've gone through in the past. I've been 
working hard; there's been some upside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here, that's positive,'' Wohlers said. ``I went through  
some (bad things) last year, and I'm still here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Sarasota, Fla., Belinda talked about a more personal goal:  
his fight against multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has put everything in perspective,'' said Belinda,  
diagnosed with the disease last August. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came here, it gave me a boost or a jolt that I did come  
back and that I am going to make a go of it,'' the Cincinnati 
right-hander said. ``If I give up a dinger to lose a game, it's not 
the end of the world like it was before. It's not what life is all 
about anymore. It's giving your all and being good to people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati was the first team to open camp Tuesday, and six more  
teams started Wednesday, including the NL champion San Diego 
Padres, who saw country star Garth Brooks report to camp at Peoria, 
Ariz. Brooks, a non-roster player, has no shot at making the major 
league team, but could be assigned to the minors if he shows 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last five months, there's been a lot of hard work,'' said  
Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone, who spent millions of Rupert 
Murdoch's dollars to retool the team. ``Right now, the light at the 
end of the tunnel is growing larger and larger. We'll soon be 
involved in actual baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibition games begin March 2, when the New York Mets play St.  
John's University at Port St. Lucie, Fla. Until then, teams will be 
working out and playing intrasquad games. 
</P>
<P>
	In other baseball news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Oakland signed free agent first baseman John Jaha to a minor  
league contract. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Dave Stieb, a 41-year-old right-hander, who came out of  
retirement last season to rejoin the Toronto Blue Jays, retired 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Pitcher Jeff Austin, the last first-round pick from the 1998

arbitration case and will get $3.55 million, a $500,000 raise. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Yankees closer Mariano Rivera asked arbitrator James Duff for  
a raise from $750,000 to $4.25 million, while the team argued the 
reliever should be paid $3 million.

<HEADLINE> Yanks Make Steal of a Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Sports Analysis    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The loudest complaints came from New Yorkers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I HATE the trade,'' shouted one caller to WFAN, the city's  
all-sports radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why do we need him?'' demanded another.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ashamed to be a Yankees fan,'' snapped a third.  
</P>
<P>
	OK, try to forget that Roger Clemens just won his record fifth  
Cy Young Award. Or that he's the first pitcher to lead the league 
in wins, ERA and strikeouts for two straight years since Lefty 
Grove in 1930-31. Or that he's the next Nolan Ryan, a physical 
marvel who seemed to get better with age. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the trade that sent Clemens from the Toronto Blue Jays  
to the World Series champions is not about The Rocket. Maybe it is 
outside New York, where most fans think it's unfair that the 
fat-cat Yankees were able to land him. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, it's about David Wells.  
</P>
<P>
	He was their very own, highly imperfect Mr. Perfection.  
</P>
<P>
	He was the guy who once wore a Babe Ruth cap to the mound. The  
tattooed brawler who threatened to knock out George Steinbrenner. 
The ace who embraced Yankees tradition by day. The big boy with the 
big gut who got toasted on the town by night. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the pinstriped fabric, for sure.  
</P>
<P>
	To his fans, Boomer was a role model, a roly-poly one at that.  
</P>
<P>
	And that's why in New York, at least, this trade will be debated  
with hearts not heads. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens is better, no doubt. A first-ballot Hall of Famer, still  
one of the greatest pitchers in history. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wells, coming off the greatest season of his life, was one  
of them, someone a fan from the Bronx sitting in the upper deck 
could identify with -- a regular guy, albeit a millionaire. And 
there aren't many like him. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's this stat that his supporters point to: Wells is  
8-1 is 10 career postseason starts; Clemens is 1-2 in nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Truth is, the Yankees didn't really need either one of them to  
make it back to the playoffs this season. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's an old axiom in baseball, and it's correct: Better  
to trade a player one year early rather than one year late. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, the Yankees were worried that Wells might never have  
another season like 1998. He was a constant irritant to manager Joe 
Torre. And, turning 36 in May, was not in tiptop condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who turns 37 in August, is one of the best-conditioned  
athletes in sports. A power pitcher, there's always a risk he could 
blow out his arm throwing a 97 mph heater -- that's what happened to 
Ryan, though not until he was 46. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens also brings with him a competitive nature that rivals  
the one that burns inside the Boss. And that attracted Steinbrenner 
even more than the stats as he tinkered with a team that won 125 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met my match in a guy who wants to win,'' Clemens said.  
``This guy, he settles for nothing less. I enjoy that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all he's done in his career, all Clemens wants now is a  
championship ring. He might be fired up even more if he watched the 
Super Bowl last month. John Elway was 37, too, when he won his 
first of two in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens says he's always admired the Yankees -- he often scoops a  
handful of dirt from the mound after pitching in the House that 
Ruth Built. Yet he wasn't afraid to touch off a beanbrawl with them 
last September by drilling Scott Brosius in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	It might take Yankees fans time to appreciate that, and they may  
never revel in his accomplishments as they did with Wells. Breaking 
up one of the greatest teams in baseball history is never fun -- 
remember, in fact, how long it took for New Yorkers to warm up to 
Tino Martinez after he replaced Don Mattingly. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Yankees made a steal of a deal with that one.  
</P>
<P>
	This time, they paid Clemens' price and made sure Cleveland, the  
Mets and the other contenders did not get him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yanks will still need a lefty reliever to replace Graeme  
Lloyd, though they were able to make the trade and protect prize 
prospect Alfonso Soriano.	   And if it's all not clear right now, it will be by Oct. 23. 
Chances are, that's the night he'll walk to the mound to start Game 
1 of the World Series. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Yankees Shocked by Wells Departure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- David Wells was in tears. Joe Torre said his  
clubhouse was in shock. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cone, as always, managed to inject some humor into the  
situation following Thursday's trade of Wells, Graeme Lloyd and 
Homer Bush to Toronto for Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be a lot of bars going out of business in New  
York,'' Cone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells relished his biker-and-six pack image, especially since  
his perfect game against Minnesota last May made him the talk of 
the town and the talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about Boomer, he almost became a cult hero  
overnight,'' Cone said. ``Last year with the perfect game, he made 
his mark in Yankees history. He can be proud of that. He won't be 
forgotten. I'm sure there are mixed emotions among the fans. As 
soon as Rocket throws his first 15-strikeout night at Yankee 
Stadium people will be oohing and wowing, saying, `What a catch!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees turned what normally is a quiet day -- the first day  
of workouts for pitchers and catchers -- into a stunning event by 
obtaining the five-time Cy Young Award winner. The deal was 
announced less than hour before the Yankees opened spring drills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being around here for the four years, you get used to things  
like this,'' pitcher Andy Pettitte said. ``Stuff like this 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For an organization known for the unexpected, the quickness of  
the transition caught Wells' former teammates off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just another indication of how the business of baseball  
is these days,'' pitcher Mike Stanton said. ``We won 125 games, but 
you're still always looking to make yourself better. What can you 
say? It's one of those things that happens in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While players were sad to see Wells depart -- though they never  
took to his fondness for heavy metal -- they were excited about the 
imminent arrival of Clemens, who is due to report Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really neat,'' Pettitte said. ``Bringing him to a team  
like this, it's not going to do anything but help us. There's no 
doubt about it. When he's on the other team, you have to hate him 
... when he's on your team, I've heard nothing but great things 
about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One player losing a close friend is Japanese pitcher Hideki  
Irabu, who was befriended by Wells during spring training last 
year. Irabu said he would take Wells out to dinner when the Yankees 
visit Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since coming to the U.S., he was the first player to say `Hi'  
to me when I came in the clubhouse,'' Irabu said through an 
interpreter. ``He really helped me -- it was huge. I'm going to be a 
little more lonely and sad he is not here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Dunedin, Blue Jays manager Tim Johnson was please to be  
getting three players who will become keys for Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know that you're going to miss a guy like Roger, 'cause  
he's a Hall of Famer,'' Johnson said. ``Knowing him for quite a few 
years, he means a lot to me not only as a pitcher but as a person, 
so that loss is tough. But we got three players that are going to 
come in and help us. We gained a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There weren't many players at Blue Jays' camp, which doesn't  
officially start until Monday. One who was there was left-hander 
Steve Sinclair, who might go to Triple-A Syracuse because of the 
acquisition of Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little disappointed,'' Sinclair said. ``I'll just have  
to go into spring training and show them what I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Kissimmee, Atlanta manager Bobby Cox was happy about the  
trade -- for selfish reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was glad he stayed in the American League,'' Cox said. ``I

<HEADLINE> Edward Jones Brokerage To Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Edward Jones &AMP; Co., the St. Louis-based  
brokerage firm, plans to more than double its number of offices in 
the United States to 10,000 over the next four years in an effort 
to keep its competitive edge in the consolidating financial 
services industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Jones also plans to expand internationally. The company  
plans to open 115 offices in Canada, and an additional 60 in the 
United Kingdom this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are gearing up to become a much larger firm,'' John W.  
Bachmann, president of Edward Jones, said in an interview. ``Our 
rate of growth is the same as it has been for 20 years, but the 
numbers themselves have become much more noticeable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company, however, has no plans of going public, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Edward Jones, formerly known as Edward D. Jones, has 4,570  
offices in the United States serving 3 million customers. But 
unlike its competitors such as Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and PaineWebber, 
which open large offices in major cities, Edward Jones has an army 
of one-broker offices in small towns throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	What's driving Bachmann's expansion strategy is the  
consolidation in the financial services industry that is blurring 
the traditional lines of competition among banks, brokerage, mutual 
funds and insurance firms. 
</P>
<P>
	And just as banks have encroached on Bachmann's turf, his firm  
is now offering customers credit cards, debit cards and check 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
	Bachmann's investment philosophy, however, hasn't changed. His  
brokers shy away from risky initial public offerings, options, 
commodity futures, and penny stocks. Instead, they pitch 
safety-first financial planning, offering stable, blue chip stocks, 
highly rated bonds and mutual funds with solid track records. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a particular niche in the market to serve the serious  
investor who is worried about their retirement,'' he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Jones will also offer customers online access to their  
accounts at the end of the month.

<HEADLINE> GOP Moderates Want Hostility To End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans must abandon ``the rhetoric of  
partisan hostility'' and adopt a more achievable, compassionate 
agenda or risk losing control of Congress in 2000, a new GOP 
moderate organization says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must restore dignity to our debate, civility to our  
conversations and compassion to our perspective,'' the Republican 
Main Street Partnership wrote in an open letter to congressional 
Republicans. ``We need a new language and a new voice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one-page note also calls for bipartisan cooperation and ``a  
new discipline for reaching consensus on difficult issues; without 
that, we believe that we will not be a majority party by the close 
of the year 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter underlines the tug of war under way within the GOP in  
the wake of President Clinton's unpopular impeachment trial and 
party losses in last November's elections. The GOP failed to 
improve its 55-45 Senate edge and lost five House seats, leaving it 
with a precarious 11-seat House margin and big questions about how 
to prepare for the 2000 presidential and congressional races. 
</P>
<P>
	One way to do that is for Republicans to relinquish the often  
sharp tone they have used in recent years, the letter says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Immediately, the rhetoric of partisan hostility must stop,''  
it says. ``Our language too often has been heard as mean, 
judgmental and partisan. That 'the other side does it' is no 
excuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership is a year-old group representing moderate  
Republicans in Congress and across the country. Among its listed 
members are 41 House members, three senators, former Secretary of 
State Henry Kissinger and ITT Corp. chairman Rand Araskog. 
</P>
<P>
	The group released its letter even as House GOP leaders try to  
craft a consensus agenda Republican lawmakers can pursue this year. 
There is general agreement to pursue a Social Security overhaul 
with Clinton and to seek tax cuts, education changes and more 
spending for defense, but the leaders are laboring to line up 
support for specific proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Some GOP aides privately expressed frustration that the moderate  
group was focusing attention on Republican divisions rather than on 
opposition Democrats. But conservative Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., 
a member of the House GOP leadership, said he welcomed the letter's 
call for GOP unity behind positive themes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's focus on showing why our ideas are good for people,''  
McIntosh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The moderates' letter was short on specifics, which is where  
many of the internal GOP disputes occur. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, on taxes it says, ``We must work to reduce the  
burden on hardworking middle-class American families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a sentiment supported by all Republicans, and many  
Democrats for that matter. But the GOP is divided over whether to 
support a 10 percent cut in income-tax rates, phased-in rate 
reductions, or narrower reductions such as ending the so-called 
marriage penalty under which some married couples owe more taxes 
than they would if single. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be hard work'' to resolve those differences,  
McIntosh said. ``But that's what we're paid to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., one of the group's  
founders, said the partnership was stressing not just centrist 
policies but enactment of legislation with Clinton. Many 
Republicans believe bipartisan legislation must become law for the 
GOP to demonstrate it can govern and is not obsessed with Clinton's 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really talking about an agenda that will move the  
country forward,'' Houghton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Houghton also said that moderates will not hesitate to take  
advantage of the GOP's razor-thin House margin to influence the 
party's direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody in the leadership says we need to pull together  
and act as a team, that goes both ways,'' he said. ``You have to 
let us talk about things that are important to us. You can't just 
bottle them up.''

<HEADLINE> SEC Puts New Y2K Database on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission has put  
a new database on its Web site giving investors access to the Year 
2000 readiness reports filed by brokerage firms, mutual funds and 
other financial companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The database now has more than 13,000 reports describing  
companies' computer readiness for the Year 2000 date change, how 
much it is costing them to prepare, and their contingency plans in 
case the systems fail, the SEC said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The market watchdog agency says it views the Year 2000 problem  
as a serious issue that, if not adequately addressed, could disrupt 
the functioning of many of the world's computer systems. To prevent 
disruptions, companies need to examine their computer systems, 
retool them, and test the systems and their interactions with other 
companies' systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC recently charged 37 relatively small brokerage firms and  
nine stock-transfer agents with failing to fully disclose their 
Year 2000 readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the SEC's chief accountant said a check of financial  
reports that publicly traded companies must submit to the agency 
shows that many of them are still not complying with Year 2000 
disclosure requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	He said more than half the companies in an unspecified sample  
failed to disclose how much it is costing them to get their 
computer systems ready for the millennial change, while close to 
half didn't describe their contingency plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as Y2K, the Year 2000 problem reflects programming in many  
older computers that recognizes just the last two digits of a year 
in reading a date. Machines that haven't been upgraded are likely 
to interpret Jan. 1, 2000 as Jan. 1, 1900. That could cause massive 
computer failures, lost data, or broken connections with clients.

<HEADLINE> Patriots Sign Lee Johnson As Punter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- The New England Patriots have signed  
veteran punter Lee Johnson to a three-year, $2 million dollar 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson replaces punter Tom Tupa, an 11-year veteran who the  
Patriots lost last week to the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 37, was fifth in the AFC last season with an average  
44.7 yards per punt with the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2 200-pounder posted a career-high in 1996 when he  
averaged 45.4 yards on 80 punts. Johnson ranks ninth in NFL history 
with 984 punts and 41,895 yards, while maintaining a career average 
42.6 yards.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall on Inflation Concerns / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Thursday as inflation concerns  
intensified with a report showing that wholesale prices posted the 
biggest jump in two years during January. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell one point,  
or $10.00 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, rose to 5.38 percent from 5.31 percent late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The selling came after the Labor Department reported that its  
Producer Price Index rose 0.5 percent in January, the most since 
October 1996, amid a spike in food and energy prices. Excluding 
food and energy, producer prices edged 0.1 percent lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds have been pressured by recent data showing surprising  
strength in the economy, which could aggravate inflationary 
pressures and make fixed income investments less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market Thursday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities fell between 1/8 point and 5/16 point, and intermediate 
maturities fell 15/32 point to 5/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 3.61 
points to 1,295.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.52 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point from late Wednesday to 4.42 
percent. Six-month yields rose to 4.61 percent, as the discount 
rose 0.02 percentage point to 4.45 percent. One-year yields rose to 
4.70 percent as the discount rose 0.04 percentage point to 4.49 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, was unchanged from late Wednesday's 4.69 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 3/32 to 125 3/16. The average yield to 
maturity was unchanged at 5.14 percent.

<HEADLINE> Congress Divided on Education Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal law that gives states and local  
school districts $12 billion a year to help poor students is 
expiring, and congressional Republicans and Democrats are divided 
over how to rework it. 
</P>
<P>
	The goals of the 35-year-old education law seem universal:  
better schools, smarter spending and more answers for parents whose 
children are not learning. But this year marks the first time a 
Republican majority has had a shot at rewriting it, and that could 
change the way some programs operate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fights you will see happening will really be about who  
controls the money and the policy,'' said Joe Karpinski, a 
spokesman for the Senate Education Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton announced last month major changes he wants in  
the law, which would include tying more of the federal money that 
schools get to whether they are meeting his goals. Those goals 
include such elements as improved teacher training. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, the first education laws likely to come up during  
this session of Congress reflect Republican efforts to counter 
Clinton's views. For example, a Republican-favored ``ed flex'' bill 
would let states who get federal money excuse themselves from 
regulations they consider burdensome. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, scheduled for a vote next week, could be among the  
Senate's first post-impeachment actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Republicans' first education bill, which could reach a  
vote by Easter, also pushes hard to give local schools and states 
more control. 
</P>
<P>
	It spells out three primary priorities: flexibility, tax credits  
for school construction and making sure 95 percent of federal money 
is spent on classroom instruction rather than administrative 
overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old law to help poor students, students who don't  
speak English and others with particular educational problems, 
expires every five years -- this year on Sept. 30. The law, which 
affects almost every school district in the nation, includes 
federal financing for teacher and school staff training, bilingual 
education, after-school programs, drug and violence prevention and 
computer installation. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after its renewal in 1994, the GOP majority emerged in  
Congress, with some of the most conservative members demanding that 
the Education Department be disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of members discovered it's easier to impeach a  
president than to do away with the Department of Education,'' said 
Jay Diskey, the spokesman for the House Education Committee. This 
year, the leadership's main goal is to get the law renewed: ``We 
don't want a political football next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For their part, school groups generally want few changes in the  
law. A coalition of teachers' unions, private and parochial school 
groups and public school officials agreed this month to put aside 
their differences and work together. They plan to fight more 
conservative ideas such as vouchers, which use public money to send 
poor children to private schools.

<HEADLINE> S&AMP;P Downgrades Japan Life Insurers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Standard and Poor's, a U.S. credit rating agency,  
lowered its ratings on four major Japanese life insurers Thursday, 
saying the companies had been hurt by market and economic 
turbulence in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	S&AMP;P said the financial strength and creditworthiness of loan  
portfolios at Asahi Mutual Life Insurance Co., Mitsui Life 
Insurance Co., Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. and Yasuda Mutual Life 
had weakened. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency added that the four companies' exposure to Japan's  
ailing banking sector and volatile real estate and equity markets 
was high. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit rating for Asahi Mutual Life and Mitsui Life dropped  
from BBB-minus to BB-plus. That's ``junk'' status, or too risky in 
S&AMP;P's view for non-speculative investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo Life's fell to BBB-minus from BBB, and Yasuda Mutual  
Life's fell to A-minus from A. 
</P>
<P>
	The ratings of two other major insurers -- Dai-Ichi Mutual Life  
Insurance Co. and Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co. -- remained at 
A-minus and A-plus respectively, but the outlook for all six 
companies was poor, S&AMP;P said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said Japan's insurance sector was threatened by  
increased competition from foreign companies, which are entering 
the Japanese market as the government implements a wide range of 
financial deregulation measures. 
</P>
<P>
	A ratings downgrade can raise the cost of borrowing for a  
company by making investors more concerned about the danger of 
failure.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Steps Up Effort on Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux is stepping up his efforts to  
assemble an ownership group that would ease the Pittsburgh Penguins 
out of bankruptcy, meeting with Gov. Tom Ridge and NHL officials to 
rally support for his bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's legal representatives held another in a series of  
ongoing meetings Thursday with NHL legal counsel in New York as the 
six-time league scoring champion rushes to gather a viable 
ownership group by late March. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux must raise at least $40 million and possibly more to  
clean up the Penguins' debt-laden balance sheet and supply 
short-term working capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins co-owner Roger Marino's lawyer, Harry Manion, last week  
dismissed Lemieux's bid as being unrealistic, but Lemieux advisor 
Chuck Greenberg said Thursday, ``I think we have a very good 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has appeared only infrequently in public since retiring  
after the 1996-97 season, but he has taken a far more visible and 
active role in assembling investors than might previously have been 
imagined. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mario is totally involved in this process; he's in meetings  
10-12 hours a day with us,'' said Greenberg, a Pittsburgh lawyer. 
``Since he went public with his intentions last week, there has 
been a tidal wave of enthusiasm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has not endorsed Lemieux's bid,  
but is encouraging it and has met at least once with Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz will begin next month to  
consider offers to reorganize the Penguins' debt, estimated at more 
than $125 million -- including $80 million owed unsecured creditors 
such as Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux is due $26.2 million in deferred compensation, but would  
exchange much of that debt for equity in any ownership group. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux apparently will submit a plan even if he has not yet  
raised the necessary equity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that in a month's time, if we haven't raised it all,  
we'll be close. We've made enormous progress,'' Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Lemieux nor Greenberg has disclosed any possible  
investors, but Lemieux apparently has received some firm 
commitments. One possible partner: golfing buddy Dan Marino, the 
Miami Dolphins quarterback and former Pitt star who considered 
buying into the Pirates three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to find some investors who would not only buy the  
team but keep them in Pittsburgh,'' Lemieux said. ``It's a great 
hockey town and the fans deserve something better than a team in 
bankruptcy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Marino, who angered Lemieux last year by trying to  
renegotiate his deferred compensation, has offered to work with 
Lemieux. But Lemieux said he will not partner with Marino, who has 
lost an estimated $37.5 million since buying into the Penguins two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility that Lemieux, who remains Pittsburgh's most  
popular sports figure nearly two years after his retirement, might 
acquire a partial ownership stake has raised hopes the Penguins can 
remain in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Because any individual or group can submit a reorganization  
plan, there had been speculation that an out-of-town group might 
try to scoop up the Penguins at a bargain-basement price and then 
relocate them.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lawyers Want Wright To Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Lawyers will not ask a federal judge to  
recuse herself from deciding whether to hold President Clinton in 
contempt for denying under oath that he had a relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on condition of anonymity, sources close to the  
president's lawyers said Wednesday that they will instead argue in 
court against a contempt charge for testimony the president gave 
about the former White House intern in the lawsuit filed by Paula 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	John Whitehead, an attorney for Mrs. Jones, also said that his  
side will not ask U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright -- who 
dismissed Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton 
last year -- to step aside. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett would not say whether he planned  
to ask the judge to step aside. Nor did Bennett say anything 
Tuesday about the contempt issue during a telephone conference 
between the judge and lawyers involved in Mrs. Jones lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	After that conference, Wright issued an order saying she was  
ready to address the contempt issue. Punishments for contempt range 
from a reprimand to a fine or jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright noted in her order that she had contact with a House  
impeachment manager, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., and said she 
would step aside if lawyers asked her to. She said she did not 
believe there was any reason for her to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright also disclosed Tuesday that her law clerk provided an  
affidavit for possible use in the impeachment case. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge first raised the contempt issue in a footnote to a  
Sept. 1 ruling in which she said she was releasing Clinton's 
testimony in a Jan. 17 deposition in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	In raising the contempt issue, Wright said she ``has concerns  
about the nature'' of the president's deposition but made ``no 
findings at this time regarding whether the president may be in 
contempt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the deposition, Clinton said: ``I have never had sexual  
relations with Monica Lewinsky.'' He acknowledged Aug. 17 before a 
federal grand jury -- and again in a nationally televised address -- 
that he had an inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE>  Aegon Is Buying Transamerica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Dutch insurer Aegon NV is buying  
the U.S. life insurance company Transamerica Corp. for $9.7 billion 
in cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Aegon said the deal announced today would make it the third  
largest U.S. life insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporate and insurance operations of San Francisco-based  
Transamerica will merge with Aegon's businesses in the United 
States when the deal is completed this summer, the Dutch company 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Aegon's U.S. arm includes the operations of the Providian Corp.  
which it bought in 1996 in a deal valued at $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Shepard, chairman and chief executive of Aegon USA, said  
at a New York news conference that there will be some layoffs, but 
did not give a specific number. He said the companies are aiming 
for $150 million in annual cost savings from the merger over the 
next three years, with about $40 million of that coming from 
combining staffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transamerica deal will make Aegon the third-largest life  
insurer in the United States in terms of assets and premium 
written, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aegon will assume about $1.1 billion of Transamerica's holding  
company debt as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Aegon Chairman Kees Storm said in a statement that he is  
confident the integration of the U.S. group will go smoothly. 
``Aegon has a proven track record of successfully integrating 
companies and people,'' Storm said.

<HEADLINE>  Aegon Is Buying Transamerica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Dutch insurer Aegon NV is buying  
the U.S. life insurance company Transamerica Corp. for $9.7 billion 
in cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Aegon said the deal announced today would make it the third  
largest U.S. life insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporate and insurance operations of San Francisco-based  
Transamerica will merge with Aegon's businesses in the United 
States when the deal is completed this summer, the Dutch company 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Aegon's U.S. arm includes the operations of the Providian Corp.  
which it bought in 1996 in a deal valued at $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Shepard, chairman and chief executive of Aegon USA, said  
at a New York news conference that there will be some layoffs, but 
did not give a specific number. He said the companies are aiming 
for $150 million in annual cost savings from the merger over the 
next three years, with about $40 million of that coming from 
combining staffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transamerica deal will make Aegon the third-largest life  
insurer in the United States in terms of assets and premium 
written, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aegon will assume about $1.1 billion of Transamerica's holding  
company debt as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Aegon Chairman Kees Storm said in a statement that he is  
confident the integration of the U.S. group will go smoothly. 
``Aegon has a proven track record of successfully integrating 
companies and people,'' Storm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Transamerica Chairman Frank Herringer called the deal a  
``well-considered strategic move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henk Brouwer, an analyst with the National Investeringsbank in  
Amsterdam, agreed. ``It's a very good deal,'' he said. ``Aegon will 
get access into countries such as Canada where it wasn't active 
before and it will be able to achieve a higher autonomous growth.''

	Transamerica stock shot up $15.12 1/8, or by 26.2 percent, to  
$72.75 a share this afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange, where 
Aegon's U.S. shares jumped $4, or by 4.2 percent, to $98.75.

<HEADLINE>  Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Baseball's two best teams went in opposite directions as spring  
training workouts officially began Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees completed their winter-long courtship of  
Roger Clemens, acquiring the five-time Cy Young Award winner from 
Toronto for David Wells, Graeme Lloyd and Homer Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade stunned the Yankees, coming off a record-setting  
125-win season and barely settled into Legends Field for their 
7 1/2-week spring stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bombshell. The first day of spring, you walk in and  
you're floored by this type of news,'' David Cone said. ``The only 
way to get away with trading someone as popular as Boomer is for 
Roger Clemens. It's the only deal that could have been made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves were dealt a serious blow when doctors  
announced that first baseman Andres Galarraga has a cancerous tumor 
in his back and will miss the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the potential for his recovery is very good with  
successful treatment,'' Dr. Lee Kelley said. ``There's no 
widespread involvement, so the outlook is very good. I think 
there's a good possibility that he can look forward to playing in 
2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, 37, will undergo six months of treatment, which will  
include chemotherapy followed by radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Klesko is expected to replace Galarraga, who hit .305 with  
44 homers and 121 RBIs last season. Otis Nixon and Gerald Williams 
are expected to share time in left field in place of Klesko. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our offense will be potent, but obviously not as potent  
without Andres,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, coming off consecutive Cy Youngs, will report to the  
Yankees on Saturday. He went 20-6 last season, leading the AL in 
ERA (2.65) and strikeouts (271), and tying for the lead in wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roger Clemens is a non-stop Hall of Famer,'' Yankees manager  
Joe Torre said. ``The last two years, what he's done, it's 
incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who was also sought by Texas, Cleveland and Houston,  
has always been one of Steinbrenner's favorite players, and is the 
only five-time Cy Young winner in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met my match in a guy who wants to win,'' Clemens said after  
speaking with The Boss. ``This guy, he settles for nothing less. I 
enjoy that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto had wanted several young prospects from teams when it  
shopped Clemens in December, but the Yankees were able to hold onto 
some of the players the Blue Jays coveted most: outfielder Ricky 
Ledee and pitcher Ramiro Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had an offer yesterday from them to us that made my knees  
buckle,'' New York general manager Brian Cashman said. ``It's tough 
when you have a player the caliber of Roger Clemens staring you in 
the face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, a quirky left-hander known as ``Boomer,'' was the toast  
of New York after pitching a perfect game against the Minnesota 
Twins on May 17. He was one of the team's most effective pitchers 
with an 18-4 record and a 3.49 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little emotional right now,'' Wells said. ``Give me a  
couple days. It's a little tough right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd, a 31-year-old left-hander from Australia, was 3-0 with a  
1.67 ERA in 50 relief appearances last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, a 26-year-old who plays primarily at second base, hit .380  
in 71 at-bats for the Yankees but was considered expendable because 
New York has Chuck Knoblauch. 
</P>
<P>
	In other baseball news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Cleveland shortstop Omar Vizquel abandoned the idea of staying  
away from spring training to prod the Indians to improve his $21 
million, seven-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's safe to say that I'll be there on time,'' said Vizquel,  
who is expected to report Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mariano Rivera made it 2-0 for Yankees players in salary  
arbitration when he was awarded $4.25 million rather than the 
team's $3 million offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners are 6-2 in arbitration this year, losing only to Rivera  
and to Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, who will get $5 million this 
year instead of the team's $3.2 million offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the final three cases were argued Thursday, with  
Baltimore catcher Charles Johnson and Cincinnati pitcher John Hudek 
going before three-man panels. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mo Vaughn showed up at Angels camp in Tempe Ariz., with a  
message for his new teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to come by and say hello to the fellas, and let them  
know the work starts now,'' said Vaughn, a free agent first baseman 
who signed an $80 million, six-year contract with the Angels in 
November. ``I wanted to show them that I'm eager to get things done 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Randy Johnson said he's much more at ease in his first spring  
training with Arizona than he was the last two years with Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, he was coming off back surgery and was dealing with all  
the doubts about whether he would return to his old intimidating 
form. Last year, he was in a sour mood after the Mariners' decided 
against extending his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is probably going to be one of my better spring  
trainings,'' Johnson said after his first workout with the 
Diamondbacks. ``Last year, I had to deal with a lot of contract 
stuff and I'm really glad it's over and behind me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mark Wohlers couldn't find his control in his first workout at  
Braves camp in Kissimmee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves right-hander, who inexplicably lost the  
ability to throw strikes last season, hit two batters, nearly threw 
a ball over the batting cage and skipped a pitch six feet in front 
of home plate during his five minutes on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Peoria, Ariz., Garth Brooks was the first player at  
practice as the San Diego Padres began formal spring training 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody ever wanted to be better,'' the country music  
star/outfielder said as about 50 fans crowded outside the complex 
for his autograph. ``My want is so much greater than my talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Right-hander Ben McDonald, sidelined nearly two years because  
of shoulder problems, agreed to a minor league contract with Tampa 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays also learned outfielder Quinton McCracken has a  
sprained right knee that will sideline him four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Jay Buhner, coming off major surgery on his right elbow,  
worked out at first base for the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a challenge, but big league players thrive on  
challenges,'' said Buhner, a former All-Star and Gold Glove right 
fielder. ``I want to see how good I can be at that position 
(first). It certainly makes for a more interesting spring 
training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Montreal Expos chairman Jacques Menard said new investors led  
by New York art dealer Jeffrey Loria are prepared to buy into the 
team but said team president Claude Brochu was an obstacle to a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Brochu is recognized as the person in charge of the team by  
major league baseball. He has been offered about $10 million for 
his 7.6 percent of the team, which says it can't survive in 
Montreal without a new stadium.

<HEADLINE> Two Kiwi Planes Are Repossessed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A British company repossessed two of Kiwi  
International Air Lines' eight planes, saying the tiny discount 
carrier had failed to honor an agreement to buy the planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Friedman, a lawyer who represents Fly Finance 1 Ltd., said  
Thursday the two Boeing 727s were repossessed last weekend, leaving 
the airline with only four planes in the air and two others 
undergoing maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one of the two planes had been flying at the time; the  
other was in Canada undergoing an overhaul, Kiwi spokesman Rob 
Kulat said. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers who would have flown on the active plane are taking  
flights on Pan Am and Sun Pacific airlines instead, Kulat said. 
Customers with Kiwi tickets will continue to check their bags at 
Kiwi counters. 
</P>
<P>
	Kulat didn't know how many flights the repossessed plane  
handled. Kiwi makes about 225 flights a week from Newark, Boston, 
Atlanta, Miami, Palm Beach and Orlando, Fla., San Juan and 
Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline, which has struggled to survive since it started  
flying in 1992, is ending service to Boston on Tuesday. The city's 
Logan International Airport has said it would ban the airline by 
then for refusing to pay debts, but Kulat said the airline had 
already planned to pull out of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	It has also ended service to Chicago and Flint, Mich., saying  
the routes were no longer profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kulat said Kiwi is still doing well. It reported a 26  
percent increase in passengers in January from a year ago, to 
58,900. 
</P>
<P>
	Fly Finance, a London-based leasing company that only owns the  
two repossessed planes, had renegotiated a lease with Kiwi shortly 
after the airline emerged from bankruptcy in 1997. The lease, which 
charged about $150,000 a month to rent both planes, expired in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Fly Finance agreed to extend the lease until Jan. 31 in return  
for a $500,000 payment from Kiwi. The company repossessed the 
planes after Kiwi let the deadline pass without buying them at a 
previously agreed-to price of $6.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kulat said Kiwi is still interested in buying the planes.

<HEADLINE> Senate Parties Recruit Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hours after learning Sen. Richard Bryan of  
Nevada would not seek re-election in 2000 -- the second Democratic 
senator to announce his retirement in as many days -- officials in 
both parties quickly moved to court replacements. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mitch McConnell, the chief Republican recruiter, called  
John Ensign, a former congressman who narrowly lost a Senate race 
last fall. Democrats contacted Bob Miller, a two-term governor who 
has been elected statewide several times. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men said they would consider the race, according to  
officials in the two parties. Ensign issued a statement saying he 
was ``taking a very serious look at it'' and would ``do some 
praying about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate chase for candidates underscores the urgency in  
the battle for control of the Senate in 2000. Republicans now hold 
a 55-45 edge, but must defend 19 seats next year, compared with 14 
for the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first, obvious conclusion is that the Democrats are going  
to have to fight like hell and use all kinds of resources just to 
stay where they are,'' said McConnell, R-Ky., who heads the GOP's 
senatorial campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``So in spite of all the big talk last week about the demise of  
the GOP in light of impeachment, we've made significant progress 
toward our goal'' of holding Senate control, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats countered that they would hold Bryan's seat -- as well  
as that of retiring Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, who 
announced his plans on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly it would be better if we did not have any retirements,  
but if we had to have two retirements, the states that both of 
those great senators represent are states Democrats will win in 
2000,'' said Joe Hansen, executive director of the Democratic 
Senatorial Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York is the third Democrat --  
and last, the party hopes -- to announce his retirement. First lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton is considering a race to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell said he knows of no retirements planned by  
Republicans, although the plans of Sen. Connie Mack of Florida are 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19 seats Republicans must defend next year include many held  
by first-termers who were pulled into office on the strength of the 
GOP landslide in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	But in an era of multimillion-dollar campaigns, few incumbents  
lose. It is mostly the seats with nonincumbents on the ballot that 
have changed hands in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan surprised even colleagues in his own party with his  
decision, announced Thursday in Las Vegas. The 61-year-old 
second-term senator said it was ``time to come home'' and 
``experience different challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state's other senator, Democrat Harry Reid, called Miller to  
urge him to run, according to party officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity, and the White House was enlisted to urge 
the former governor to jump into the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The recruiting is also intense in New Jersey, where Republicans  
are eager for second-term Gov. Christine Whitman to enter the 
Senate race. Former Democratic Gov. Jim Florio -- whom Whitman 
defeated for governor -- is expected to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Several House Democrats are weighing a bid, including Rep. Bob  
Menendez, who has more than $1 million in his campaign account and 
whom party officials expect to make the race. Also expressing 
interest is Rep. Frank Pallone. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, McConnell spoke by phone on Thursday with New York  
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the latest in a series of 
conversations the two have had. ``I don't think he's made a final 
decision yet,'' said McConnell. Rep. Rick Lazio is also a potential 
GOP contender in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Nita Lowey, a Democrat, is expected to run in New York,  
unless Mrs. Clinton does. 
</P>
<P>
	In other states, Democrats actively are recruiting.  
</P>
<P>
	The names that have surfaced include Rep. Ron Klink in  
Pennsylvania, where Sen. Rick Santorum is seeking a second term; 
Reps. Ted Strickland, Dennis Kucinich and Sherrod Brown in Ohio, 
where Sen. Mike Dewine is on the ballot; Reps. Collin Peterson and 
David Minge in Minnesota, where Sen. Rod Grams is running; and Rep. 
Debbie Stabenow in Michigan, where Sen. Spencer Abraham is seeking 
a second term.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Mayor Could Coast to Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The big snowfall that blanketed Chicago seven  
weeks ago and crippled the mass transit system for days could have 
been serious trouble for Mayor Richard M. Daley. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, angry Chicago commuters threw Mayor Michael Bilandic  
out of his job over a snowstorm fiasco 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley not only rode out the storm but, going into Tuesday's  
election, appears headed for an easy victory despite problems 
ranging from City Hall corruption to concerns about police 
brutality. 
</P>
<P>
	The 56-year-old son of Chicago's legendary Boss, Mayor Richard  
J. Daley, holds a huge lead in the polls over challenger Bobby Rush 
in his bid to win a third full term as mayor of the nation's 
third-largest city. Both candidates are Democrats; there are no 
Republicans in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Daley can be beaten and I don't think that he  
ought to be,'' declares GOP activist Tom Roeser. ``I personally 
feel that he is the best mayor in the country. The schools are 
going in the right direction. We're reclaiming the neighborhoods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rush, 51, a two-term congressman who was a Black Panther leader  
in the radical 1960s but has long since joined the mainstream, has 
been looking in vain for an issue big enough to stop Daley. 
</P>
<P>
	He grumbles that Daley's drive to upgrade the ailing public  
schools -- praised by President Clinton as a model for the nation -- 
is largely hype and that Daley's handpicked schools chief is ``the 
P.T. Barnum of public education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daley forces scoff at that notion, pointing to higher scores on  
standardized tests since the mayor took charge of the schools four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley has had his share of storms.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the last two years, five aldermen have been convicted on  
federal payoff charges and a fifth awaits trial. A host of small 
fry at City Hall and elsewhere in Daley's empire have been 
convicted of payroll padding. The city treasurer -- not a Daley ally 
-- has been charged with extortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of an elite anti-drug police unit have been convicted in  
federal court of a drug conspiracy -- one turned out to be a member 
of the Vice Lords street gang. And two officers were fired for 
beating a teen-age suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Rush has been quick to capitalize, saying, ``A police culture  
which permits harassment, cover-ups and the false arrest of our 
young people has flourished.'' Daley backers say most of the 13,000 
officers do a good job. 
</P>
<P>
	Only once did scandal come close to touching the mayor, when one  
of his closest City Council allies -- Alderman Patrick Huels -- 
resigned after it was disclosed that he helped to get a city 
subsidy for a contractor who gave him a $1.2 million loan. The 
contractor was also a friend of Daley. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I've been too lax,'' the normally outgoing and  
combative-sounding Daley said in a rare moment of public 
soul-searching. He proceeded to push two ethics-tightening 
ordinances through the council. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley supporters say that with Chicago's economy in good shape,  
most voters are not inclined to worry about such matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the economy, stupid!'' guffaws Alderman Richard Mell.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a livability factor that's higher than it's ever been,  
which gives rise to an economy that's booming in Chicago,'' says 
Mell, an old-school holdover from the era when Daley's father ran 
the Chicago Machine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Machine is gone, the city has changed and the current Daley  
is anything but a carbon copy of his father. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Daley rolled up his election victories behind an army  
of doorbell-ringing precinct captains who did favors in exchange 
for votes. Like most modern mayors, the new Daley does most of his 
campaigning in TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The old Daley prided himself on building a mass transit system,  
expressways and a giant airport. The new Daley is best known for 
managing the schools and a city beautification drive that has lined 
some downtown streets with giant concrete flower pots. Voters 
clearly like it. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Daley has served 10 years in office to his father's  
21. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent Chicago Tribune poll, published Feb. 12, shows  
Daley with 65 percent to just 13 percent for Rush and 1 percent for 
another candidate, with 20 percent undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a majority to get elected mayor in Tuesday's  
nonpartisan election. In the unlikely event that neither candidate 
gets more than 50 percent, the contest will be decided in a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley is already talking about plans for his next term.  
</P>
<P>
	``The key from my perspective is the schools,'' he says. ``That,  
from my point of view, is the heart and soul of the city.''

	``It's a bombshell. The first day of spring, you walk in and  
you're floored by this type of news,'' David Cone said. ``The only 
way to get away with trading someone as popular as Boomer is for 
Roger Clemens. It's the only deal that could have been made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves were dealt a serious blow when doctors  
announced that first baseman Andres Galarraga has a cancerous tumor 
in his back and will miss the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the potential for his recovery is very good with  
successful treatment,'' Dr. Lee Kelley said. ``There's no 
widespread involvement, so the outlook is very good. I think 
there's a good possibility that he can look forward to playing in 
2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, 37, will undergo six months of treatment, which will  
include chemotherapy followed by radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Klesko is expected to replace Galarraga, who hit .305 with  
44 homers and 121 RBIs last season. Otis Nixon and Gerald Williams 
are expected to share time in left field in place of Klesko. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our offense will be potent, but obviously not as potent  
without Andres,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, coming off consecutive Cy Youngs, will report to the  
Yankees on Saturday. He went 20-6 last season, leading the AL in 
ERA (2.65) and strikeouts (271), and tying for the lead in wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roger Clemens is a non-stop Hall of Famer,'' Yankees manager  
Joe Torre said. ``The last two years, what he's done, it's 
incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who was also sought by Texas, Cleveland and Houston,  
has always been one of Steinbrenner's favorite players, and is the 
only five-time Cy Young winner in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met my match in a guy who wants to win,'' Clemens said after  
speaking with The Boss. ``This guy, he settles for nothing less. I 
enjoy that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto had wanted several young prospects from teams when it  
shopped Clemens in December, but the Yankees were able to hold onto 
some of the players the Blue Jays coveted most: outfielder Ricky 
Ledee and pitcher Ramiro Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had an offer yesterday from them to us that made my knees  
buckle,'' New York general manager Brian Cashman said. ``It's tough 
when you have a player the caliber of Roger Clemens staring you in 
the face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, a quirky left-hander known as ``Boomer,'' was the toast  
of New York after pitching a perfect game against the Minnesota 
Twins on May 17. He was one of the team's most effective pitchers 
with an 18-4 record and a 3.49 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little emotional right now,'' Wells said. ``Give me a  
couple days. It's a little tough right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd, a 31-year-old left-hander from Australia, was 3-0 with a  
1.67 ERA in 50 relief appearances last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, a 26-year-old who plays primarily at second base, hit .380  
in 71 at-bats for the Yankees but was considered expendable because 
New York has Chuck Knoblauch. 
</P>
<P>
	In other baseball news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Cleveland shortstop Omar Vizquel abandoned the idea of staying  
away from spring training to prod the Indians to improve his $21 
million, seven-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's safe to say that I'll be there on time,'' said Vizquel,  
who is expected to report Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mariano Rivera made it 2-0 for Yankees players in salary  
arbitration when he was awarded $4.25 million rather than the 
team's $3 million offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners are 6-2 in arbitration this year, losing only to Rivera  
and to Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, who will get $5 million this 
year instead of the team's $3.2 million offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the final three cases were argued Thursday, with  
Baltimore catcher Charles Johnson and Cincinnati pitcher John Hudek 
going before three-man panels. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mo Vaughn showed up at Angels camp in Tempe Ariz., with a  
message for his new teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to come by and say hello to the fellas, and let them  
know the work starts now,'' said Vaughn, a free agent first baseman 
who signed an $80 million, six-year contract with the Angels in 
November. ``I wanted to show them that I'm eager to get things done 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Randy Johnson said he's much more at ease in his first spring  
training with Arizona than he was the last two years with Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, he was coming off back surgery and was dealing with all  
the doubts about whether he would return to his old intimidating 
form. Last year, he was in a sour mood after the Mariners' decided 
against extending his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is probably going to be one of my better spring  
trainings,'' Johnson said after his first workout with the 
Diamondbacks. ``Last year, I had to deal with a lot of contract 
stuff and I'm really glad it's over and behind me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mark Wohlers couldn't find his control in his first workout at  
Braves camp in Kissimmee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves right-hander, who inexplicably lost the  
ability to throw strikes last season, hit two batters, nearly threw 
a ball over the batting cage and skipped a pitch six feet in front 
of home plate during his five minutes on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Peoria, Ariz., Garth Brooks was the first player at  
practice as the San Diego Padres began formal spring training 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody ever wanted to be better,'' the country music  
star/outfielder said as about 50 fans crowded outside the complex 
for his autograph. ``My want is so much greater than my talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Right-hander Ben McDonald, sidelined nearly two years because  
of shoulder problems, agreed to a minor league contract with Tampa 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays also learned outfielder Quinton McCracken has a  
sprained right knee that will sideline him four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Jay Buhner, coming off major surgery on his right elbow,  
worked out at first base for the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a challenge, but big league players thrive on  
challenges,'' said Buhner, a former All-Star and Gold Glove right 
fielder. ``I want to see how good I can be at that position 
(first). It certainly makes for a more interesting spring 
training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Montreal Expos chairman Jacques Menard said new investors led  
by New York art dealer Jeffrey Loria are prepared to buy into the 
team but said team president Claude Brochu was an obstacle to a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Brochu is recognized as the person in charge of the team by  
major league baseball. He has been offered about $10 million for 
his 7.6 percent of the team, which says it can't survive in 
Montreal without a new stadium.

<HEADLINE> Colon Screening Rates Still Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Too few Americans age 50 and older are regularly  
screened for colorectal cancer, the nation's second-leading cause 
of cancer deaths, according to a new government study. 
</P>
<P>
	The low screening rates come despite the availability of home  
tests for blood in stool samples and increasing insurance coverage 
of some types of colon exams, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not seeing much of an improvement in screening rates,''  
said Dr. Laura Seeff of the CDC. ``It's increased by 2 percent at 
the most over the last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cancer of the colon and rectum is expected to strike 129,400  
people in the United States this year and kill 56,600. More than 90 
percent of those stricken are 50 and over. 
</P>
<P>
	Many medical experts recommend that men and women age 50 and  
older get some type of colon exam every five years. It's also 
recommended that they get an annual test for blood in the stool. 
This can be done with a simple, at-home test. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1997 survey of 52,754 people 50 and up, only 30.4 percent  
reported having had a sigmoidoscopy -- a type of colon exam -- within 
the previous five years, and only 19.8 percent had been tested for 
blood in their stool in the preceding year, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 41 percent reported having one of the tests within the  
recommended time intervals. A sigmoidoscopy is where a tube 
threaded into the rectum checks just the lower half of the colon 
for polyps or cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests that can detect the disease early could cut deaths by as  
much as a third, Seeff said. Medicare coverage was expanded last 
year to include colorectal screenings, and most health insurance 
providers also cover them. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC said patients may not be aware of the recommendations or  
are afraid of the discomfort and embarrassment, and that doctors 
share some of the blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a subject people are comfortable speaking about, so  
patients aren't bringing it up to their physicians, and physicians 
aren't talking about it either,'' Seeff said.

<HEADLINE> EPA May Change Lead Paint Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an unusual twist, an industry group is  
lobbying against an Environmental Protection Agency proposal on the 
grounds that it would harm the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also would hurt the $50 million-a-year industry  
that disposes of lead-based paint. 
</P>
<P>
	The paint-removal businesses argue that an EPA proposal to treat  
material contaminated with lead as ordinary construction debris 
rather than hazardous waste threatens the nation's groundwater. EPA 
officials say their proposal would sharply cut the cost of removing 
lead paint from older homes and apartments, thus reducing the 
health threat to children, and would be environmentally safe. 
</P>
<P>
	To make their case, the companies are using a time-tested  
lobbying tactic that proliferated in the 1990s: forming a group 
with a memorable name and using grass-roots appeals to attract 
support from a public often unaware of the monetary interests 
behind the campaign. In this case, the lobbying group is the 
Alliance for Safe and Responsible Lead Abatement. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get the companies with the economic interests to fund the  
effort and the environmental groups to lend public support to the 
issue,'' said the industry's lobbyist, John Boffa. ``In the absence 
of the industry's ability to fund the campaign, you wouldn't have a 
formidable campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One environmental organization, the Maryland-based Anacostia  
Watershed Society, has joined the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very much in support of anything that would keep our  
groundwater safe,'' said Jim Connolly, the group's executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance is trying to recruit other environmental  
organizations as well, sending them a letter warning of the threat 
to groundwater. The letter doesn't mention the group is supported 
by an industry with a financial interest in defeating the rules. 
Boffa said such information is provided during follow-up phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance also hired a Washington lobbyist. They spent  
$40,000 for a hydrologist to rebut EPA's studies that dumping the 
debris in landfills wouldn't threaten groundwater. And they're 
trying to make the public aware of the issue through news articles 
and opinion page pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials say their main motive is to protect the  
public from a harmful government action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lead in drinking water is such a much greater potential  
concern in the future after we take this short-term solution and 
remove all this lead and put it somewhere where it is still 
unsafe,'' said alliance executive director Jim Wachtel. His 
company, NexTec, makes products used in lead paint removal. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current federal rules, specially trained workers in  
protective clothing are called to a site where lead-painted 
fixtures are to be removed. They seal the room they're working in 
and either use chemicals to treat the debris at the site or 
transfer the materials to sealed containers to be treated at 
landfills or incinerated. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's proposed rules would let contractors simply  
remove and dump lead-painted debris with other construction 
materials in landfills, reducing the need for lead abatement 
specialists. Contractors support the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA officials say the new rules would reduce the cost by up to  
90 percent -- with no harm to the environment. The hope is that by 
reducing the cost, more homeowners and landlords will replace 
window frames, doors, railings and other materials containing 
lead-based paint and keep them away from children. 
</P>
<P>
	This would be a tremendous shot in the arm for a lot of kids,''  
EPA division director John Melone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead has been banned from paint since 1978. But children in  
older buildings are still at risk of learning disabilities and 
behavioral problems if they eat the paint as it flakes off door 
jams and window sills. An estimated 900,000 children under age 6 
have high levels of lead in their blood.

<HEADLINE> Whitaker Says He Has 'No Rust' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pernell Whitaker scoffs at suggestions he is in  
the autumn of a brilliant boxing career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no rust on me,'' said the 35-year-old Whitaker, who did  
not fight in 1998 because of being in drug and alcohol 
rehabilitation. ``I don't want any excuses. There will be no 
excuses in this fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be Saturday night in Madison Square Garden, and  
it will pit Whitaker against IBF welterweight champion Felix 
Trinidad of Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be trying to beat me, it's just that nobody has,''  
said Whitaker (41-2-1, 17 knockouts), who is convinced he won 
losing decisions against Jose Luis Ramirez and Oscar De La Hoya and 
a draw against Julio Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody has beaten the 26-year-old Trinidad (33-0, 28 knockouts),  
controversially or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker contends he has not watched any videotapes of  
Trinidad's fight. But Trinidad's father, who trains his son, 
studied tapes of Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
	`I've watched them all, especially the last one,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker's last fight, his first after losing the WBC  
welterweight title to De La Hoya, was a 12-round decision over 
Andre Pestriaev. That win was supposed to earn Whitaker a shot at 
then WBA champion Ike Quartey, but he tested positive for cocaine 
and ended up in drug-alcohol rehabilitation in 1998, a year in 
which he also got a suspended sentence for reckless driving. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still a good boxer, but the drugs and alcohol have taken  
their toll,'' the senior Trinidad said, ``but Whitaker still has 
pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a little bit slower, but he's still strong,'' the  
champion said of Whitaker. ``He has experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker also is left-handed, but Trinidad said, ``I don't think  
that's any problem. I've fought left-handers before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad, at 5-foot-10, also has physical advantages over the  
5-6 Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
	So it seems to be a matter of how much age and lifestyle have  
cost Whitaker and has Trinidad's caliber of opposition developed to 
the point of his being a fighter whose ability matches his record. 
In seven fights in the last four years, Trinidad has fought less 
than 23 full rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be Trinidad's 12th defense of the title he won by  
knocking out Maurice Blocker in the second round June 19, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker will be trying to become a welterweight champion for  
the second time. He also has held world titles as a lightweight, 
junior welterweight and junior middleweight 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be televised by HBO, but it will be preceded by a  
rebroadcast of WBC welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya's 
split-decision win over Ike Quartey last Saturday in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	In another title match, which will not be televised, IBF junior  
welterweight champion Vince Phillips will fight Terronn Millett.

<HEADLINE> Vizquel Abandons Idea of Holdout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Shortstop Omar Vizquel has abandoned the idea  
of staying away from spring training to prod the Cleveland Indians 
to improve his $21 million, seven-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's safe to say that I'll be there on time,'' Vizquel said.  
</P>
<P>
	Indians camp opened today for pitchers and catchers, and  
practice begins Saturday. Position players are to report Monday, 
with the first full-squad practice on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel said he was surprised by the reaction to his suggestion  
of a camp holdout. The idea emerged after the Indians signed second 
baseman Roberto Alomar to a $32 million, four-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it would get blown out of proportion like  
this,'' Vizquel said. ``I've got a lot of people making comments 
about me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One has been Indians catcher Sandy Alomar, Roberto's brother.  
</P>
<P>
	``Omar has only himself and his agent to blame,'' Sandy Alomar  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel said he would respond to Sandy Alomar's comments when he  
arrives in camp at Winter Haven, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Steps Up Effort on Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux is stepping up his efforts to  
assemble an ownership group that would ease the Pittsburgh Penguins 
out of bankruptcy, meeting with Gov. Tom Ridge and NHL officials to 
rally support for his bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's legal representatives held another in a series of  
ongoing meetings Thursday with NHL legal counsel in New York as the 
six-time league scoring champion rushes to gather a viable 
ownership group by late March. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux must raise at least $40 million and possibly more to  
clean up the Penguins' debt-laden balance sheet and supply 
short-term working capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins co-owner Roger Marino's lawyer, Harry Manion, last week  
dismissed Lemieux's bid as being unrealistic, but Lemieux advisor 
Chuck Greenberg said Thursday, ``I think we have a very good 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has appeared only infrequently in public since retiring  
after the 1996-97 season, but he has taken a far more visible and 
active role in assembling investors than might previously have been 
imagined. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mario is totally involved in this process; he's in meetings  
10-12 hours a day with us,'' said Greenberg, a Pittsburgh lawyer. 
``Since he went public with his intentions last week, there has 
been a tidal wave of enthusiasm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has not endorsed Lemieux's bid,  
but is encouraging it and has met at least once with Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz will begin next month to  
consider offers to reorganize the Penguins' debt, estimated at more 
than $125 million -- including $80 million owed unsecured creditors 
such as Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux is due $26.2 million in deferred compensation, but would  
exchange much of that debt for equity in any ownership group. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux apparently will submit a plan even if he has not yet  
raised the necessary equity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that in a month's time, if we haven't raised it all,  
we'll be close. We've made enormous progress,'' Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Lemieux nor Greenberg has disclosed any possible  
investors, but Lemieux apparently has received some firm 
commitments. One possible partner: golfing buddy Dan Marino, the 
Miami Dolphins quarterback and former Pitt star who considered 
buying into the Pirates three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to find some investors who would not only buy the  
team but keep them in Pittsburgh,'' Lemieux said. ``It's a great 
hockey town and the fans deserve something better than a team in 
bankruptcy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Marino, who angered Lemieux last year by trying to  
renegotiate his deferred compensation, has offered to work with 
Lemieux. But Lemieux said he will not partner with Marino, who has 
lost an estimated $37.5 million since buying into the Penguins two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility that Lemieux, who remains Pittsburgh's most  
popular sports figure nearly two years after his retirement, might 
acquire a partial ownership stake has raised hopes the Penguins can 
remain in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Because any individual or group can submit a reorganization  
plan, there had been speculation that an out-of-town group might 
try to scoop up the Penguins at a bargain-basement price and then 
relocate them.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Fans Boo Clemens Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- For Red Sox fans, the only thing worse than losing  
Roger Clemens to Toronto three years ago was learning Thursday that 
he'll soon be wearing pinstripes. 
</P>
<P>
	News spread quickly that the five-time Cy Young Award winner was  
traded to the New York Yankees. On talk radio and in bars, it 
created a fuss among frustrated fans that rivaled the outcry on the 
day he left the Red Sox after 13 years on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Some blamed Clemens for selling out to the ultimate enemy.  
Others lambasted the Red Sox and general manager Dan Duquette for 
letting him go in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the complaint, one thing was perfectly clear: the  
36-year-old right-hander continues to hold a place in the tormented 
hearts of Red Sox fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a big slap in the face,'' said 17-year-old Ed  
Tullos of Dedham. ``He knows that they're the archenemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving for Toronto in 1996, Clemens had played his  
entire career with the Red Sox, going 192-111 with a 3.06 ERA. He 
won the AL Cy Young Award in 1986, 1987 and 1991, and set the 
strikeout record for a nine-inning game with 20 against Seattle in 
1986 and matched it nine years later against Detroit. Chicago Cubs 
rookie Kerry Wood hit the mark last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's trade dominated the talk on WEEI-AM sports radio,  
where callers vented their frustration non-stop. 
</P>
<P>
	One caller -- identifying himself only as Ryan from Cape Cod --  
hoped aloud Clemens would bring bad luck to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``That two-faced moron is going to turn everyone against each  
other,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens was traded to the Yankees for star pitcher David Wells,  
reliever Graeme Lloyd and infielder Homer Bush. Clemens agreed to 
the deal but did not get an extension to his contract, which has 
two years to run and calls for him to be paid $16.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Farid Nouri, a 25-year-old Yankees fan from Boston, said he's  
not sure why Red Sox fans are so upset in an era where team loyalty 
has been replaced by free agency, driven by the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a business,'' Nouri said. ``They should forget about  
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Sachely, owner of the Card Collectors Closet in  
Springfield, said if Red Sox fans are bitter, they should take it 
out on team management, not Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Duquette is to blame for losing the Rocket, slugger Mo  
Vaughn and Wade Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could you imagine if they had Clemens and Boggs and Vaughn in  
one year?'' he said. ``What they could have done!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Saklad, general manager of Twins Souvenirs, across from  
Fenway Park, said he thinks Red Sox fans will forgive Clemens.

<HEADLINE> Lautenberg Won't Seek 4th Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Sen. Frank Lautenberg has retired after  
facing the ``searing reality'' that he would have to spend at least 
half of what's left of his third term dialing for dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg, a 75-year-old Democrat, changed his mind about a  
re-election bid in 2000 after the end of President Clinton's 
impeachment trial, which he said kept him from raising about 
$750,000 for a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg is the second veteran Democrat not to seek  
re-election in 2000, joining New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
With 19 GOP seats and 14 Democratic seats up for reelection, the 
departures create opportunities for the Republicans, who have a 
55-45 advantage in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The compelling factor ... was the searing reality that I would  
have had to spend half of every day between now and the next 
election fund raising,'' Lautenberg told supporters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg has been known for a liberal voting record and  
support of Clinton's programs. In 1984, he successfully pushed a 
measure making 21 the legal drinking age in all 50 states; in 1990, 
he sponsored legislation that banned smoking on domestic airline 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton on Wednesday called Lautenberg ``a principled champion  
of the people of New Jersey and the children of America,'' praising 
his efforts to stop young people from smoking and balance the 
federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg had insisted for months that he wanted to win another  
term in hopes of becoming a committee chairman should Democrats win 
back the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, he said, he decided to spend his remaining time in  
office working on legislation. High on Lautenberg's agenda is a 
bill, endorsed by the president, to require background checks when 
firearms are purchased at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Christie Whitman, often mentioned as a possible GOP  
candidate for Senate in 2000, said Lautenberg's announcement would 
have no bearing on whether she runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Robert Menendez, the first Hispanic-American to win  
election to House leadership, is a potential Democratic contender. 
He is vice chairman of the Democratic caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg made no endorsement. ``There are lots of good people  
out there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg, a resident of Cliffside Park, earned millions as  
founder of Automatic Data Processing, a payroll services company, 
before entering politics in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	That year he won an open Senate seat by defeating Republican  
Rep. Millicent Fenwick, the model for Lacey Davenport in the 
``Doonesbury'' comic strip. That campaign, and his two subsequent 
re-election victories, gave him a reputation as a bruising and 
aggressive campaigner. 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg is the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget  
Committee. He also serves on the Appropriations, Environment and 
Public Works and Intelligence committees.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Need Some Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Grizzlies are taking the  
long way around this shortened NBA season. 
</P>
<P>
	After beating the Los Angeles Clippers in two overtimes Tuesday  
night, Vancouver flew home to play the Boston Celtics on Wednesday 
and went three overtimes before losing 131-129. 
</P>
<P>
	Ah, youth!  
</P>
<P>
	``This is what I want to do. I'd rather be playing than  
sitting,'' said Mike Bibby, the Grizzlies' rookie point guard who 
logged 54 minutes against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other time a team played five overtimes in two  
consecutive games was 47 years ago, before there was a 24-second 
shot clock. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1951 the New York Knicks and Rochester Royals played  
a single-overtime game, then played four overtimes two days later. 
For the record, the teams split. 
</P>
<P>
	But those games were two days apart. The young Grizzlies did it  
back-to-back early in a season in which teams have been thrown 
together and had trained for just two weeks following the end of 
the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The players said they were more disappointed than tired after  
playing what amounted to more than 2 1/2 games -- 121 minutes in 
playing time -- in 28 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	They blew their chance of winning three straight games for just  
the second time in team history and could have improved to 4-3, 
which would have marked the first time they were over .500 this 
late in the season since 1995-96, their first year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely a tough one for us, especially coming off  
last night,'' center Bryant Reeves said after the Celtics game. 
``We both played in California last night so they were in the same 
situation. We had chances to win and we just didn't capitalize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston coach Rick Pitino, whose team had lost the night before  
in Sacramento, said the game was ``really like a Rocky fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the highlights of Wednesday's game:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Grizzlies, who led 74-64 after three quarters, never  
trailed until 4:10 into the fourth quarter. After that, there were 
17 lead changes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Boston's Dana Barros forced the first overtime when he hit a  
3-pointer with 0.5 seconds left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Celtics led by eight points in the first OT, only to allow  
a 10-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Celtics blew a four-point lead in the final minute of the  
second OT. 
</P>
<P>
	-- And finally, the Grizzlies squandered a four-point lead in the  
final 50 seconds of the third overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics' Paul Pierce cut the lead to 129-127 with a short  
jumper, then Andrew DeClercq put Boston up for good with a 
three-point play with 15.8 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies never got another shot off thanks to Pierce's two  
steals on Vancouver's final two possessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was saying to myself, `I hope we don't go into another  
overtime.' It sort of wears on your legs. I was glad it was over, 
'' said Pierce, who scored seven of his 26 points in the third OT 
and finished with seven steals. ``It was grueling but it was a lot 
of fun to be out there, competing against some of the top players 
in the world. I feel like I'm in Fantasyland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver set a team record for most points in a game, although  
their previous best of 121 points was set in four quarters. The 
Grizzlies also set team records for most free-throws made (45), 
most attempted (50) and the longest game (3:49). 
</P>
<P>
	Shareef Abdur-Rahim, who played 56 minutes, scored a career-high  
39 points, while Bibby scored 23. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no rest for the weary, either.  
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies, off to Minnesota for a game Friday, won't have  
more than one day rest between games until they get a two-day break 
in late April. The Celtics are in the middle of a six-game road 
trip that takes them to Portland on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Clarksville Paper Always Delivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The day after a tornado devastated  
downtown Clarksville and demolished the newsroom of the city's only 
daily newspaper, residents awoke to a pleasant surprise amid the 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers on their doorsteps.  
</P>
<P>
	The twister that touched down before dawn on Jan. 22 demolished  
the newsroom of The Leaf-Chronicle. The staff never skipped a beat, 
publishing the next day's paper and every day since. 
</P>
<P>
	They have moved their offices three times -- from the publisher's  
house to a hotel lobby to an abandoned supermarket, where a neon 
``Fresh!'' sign shines next to The Leaf-Chronicle banner and the 
city editor sits in the ``nuts'' aisle. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper still gets letters thanking the staff for its effort.  
</P>
<P>
	``To see the newspaper show up and to know that they were still  
out there, that was wonderful,'' said Anthony Golden, a psychology 
professor at Austin Peay State University whose own office was 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado cut about a five-mile swath through Clarksville, a  
city of 89,000. Incredibly, only five people suffered minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Two landmark churches, the huge county courthouse, the city  
museum and dozens of homes and businesses were damaged or 
destroyed. The tornado ripped the ceiling and walls off The 
Leaf-Chronicle's second-story newsroom before rain soaked 
everything inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Photo editor Fred Dye was working at home when the storm hit at  
4:15 a.m. His grabbed a camera and raced downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	When he got there he found another photographer and a security  
guard. In the rainy darkness, they crawled into the newsroom to 
salvage equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	They took the computers to Dye's home, ran an extra phone line  
from his upstairs neighbor's apartment and had photos of the damage 
ready before 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Editorial page editor Alane Megna was at home on the phone with  
the paper's publisher trying to gauge the damage when a TV station 
reported the newspaper building had been destroyed. Her mother saw 
the report and called. 
</P>
<P>
	``I almost shouted at the poor woman because she was saying,  
`Well, if the building's gone, you're not going to have a newspaper 
tomorrow,''' Megna said. ``And I said, `We will have a newspaper, 
Mom! I don't know how we're going to publish it yet but there will 
be a Leaf-Chronicle tomorrow if I have to take my little printer 
and print it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Gene Washer put out word that the office would  
relocate to his house and the Kentucky New Era newspaper in 
Hopkinsville, Ky., had offered its presses. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first day of work for newly hired executive editor  
Richard Stevens. ``I met most of my staff at 1 p.m. in a parking 
lot in the rain,'' he said, shaking his head in amazement. 
</P>
<P>
	He took about two dozen staffers to Hopkinsville; the rest  
stayed in Clarksville to work. Twelve hours after Stevens met his 
staff, the New Era's presses rolled out 32,000 copies of a 24-page 
Leaf-Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Washer waited for his own copy to arrive in his mailbox.  
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you, when I took it out, big old tears came down my  
eyes.'' Washer said. ``I've been here 36 years and I just couldn't 
imagine this thing not going to press under my watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the rest of Clarksville, Leaf-Chronicle staffers still are  
dealing with the disaster. It will be at least six months until 
their office is rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
	The next few weeks may be the toughest, said Mike Jacobs, editor  
of the Grand Forks Herald in Grand Forks, N.D. His paper won the 
1998 Pulitzer Prize for public service after publishing through a 
fire and floods that destroyed its building and much of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the initial excitement kept his employees from thinking  
about the devastation, but they eventually had to tally up the 
emotional damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't minimize the loss of the workplace. People spend a  
lot more time awake at work than they do at home,'' Jacobs said. 
``People make their workplace an extension of themselves, and 
that's lost in the disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf-Chronicle copy desk chief Dena Christian waited more than  
two weeks before going back to see the damaged newsroom. She 
pointed out a mangled desk she believes was hers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found a coffee cup. That was all I was able to bring back,''  
she said sadly. ``Years of files. I had a lot of personal items ... 
they're gone, gone, gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But something has been gained, Leaf-Chronicle staffers say: a  
new pride in the community and the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very tight-knit group before the tornado. But in  
the face of all this adversity and disaster this newspaper has 
grown by leaps and bounds,'' production manager Duke Friedel said. 
``We're going to be much stronger and much better coming out of 
this.''

<HEADLINE> Cable Series Upsets Nichols, May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Nichols and Elaine May are fuming over a  
cable series, ``The Fifties: The Burning Desire,'' which they claim 
used one of their comedy sketches illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	A video clip of the duo's routine ``The Teen-agers'' was aired  
without permission, they allege in a lawsuit filed Wednesday 
against A&AMP;E Television Networks and the show's producer. 
</P>
<P>
	The sketch, a look at sexual attitudes and mores of the '50s,  
was first televised in 1958 on ``The Perry Como Show.'' In April 
1998, a clip of it was broadcast in a segment of the six-part 
series ``The Fifties'' on The History Channel, a unit of A&AMP;E. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are the Toronto-based producer, The Fifties Inc.;  
A&AMP;E; and The History Channel. Nichols and May seek $25,000 in 
damages and a ban on continued use of their material. 
</P>
<P>
	Series director Alex Gibney said he was unaware of the lawsuit,  
but ``for them to allege that we hadn't bothered to get permission 
for the clip would be incorrect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Morganstein, vice president of public affairs for the  
network, said, ``We have not been served with any papers and we 
have no comment.''

<HEADLINE> 'Life is Beautiful' Makes $21.9M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Getting a boost from seven Oscar nominations,  
Italy's ``Life is Beautiful'' has become the highest-grossing 
foreign-language film ever in North America, earning nearly $21.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of a father who uses humor to shield his son from the  
horrors of a Nazi concentration camp, ``Life is Beautiful'' stars 
Roberto Benigni, who also directed and co-wrote the screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax expanded the film to wide release in 644 theaters for  
the four-day Presidents Day weekend. The film grossed more than 
$2.8 million over the holiday weekend, its 17th week in release in 
North America. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record-holder was ``Il Postino,'' a 1996  
best-picture nominee also distributed by Miramax, that grossed 
$21.8 million. The dollars are not adjusted for inflation or rises 
in ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The success of `Life is Beautiful' is unprecedented and it's  
still going strong,'' Miramax co-Chairman Harvey Weinstein said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful'' received a major push from last week's  
Oscar nominations. The film was nominated for both best picture and 
best foreign-language film. In addition, Benigni was nominated for 
best actor and director and shared an original screenplay 
nomination with co-writer Vincenzo Cerami. Other nominations went 
for editing and dramatic score. 
</P>
<P>
	Benigni became the fourth person in the history of the Oscars to  
be nominated for actor, director and screenwriting for a single 
film, joining Orson Welles for ``Citizen Kane,'' Woody Allen for 
``Annie Hall'' and Warren Beatty for ``Reds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The success of ``Life is Beautiful'' follows a trend in  
foreign-language films, with audiences and the Academy responding 
most to heart-tugging tales that often involve children, rather 
than the edgier work of Francois Truffaut, Michelangelo Antonioni 
or Federico Fellini of the late 1950s through 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Another popular foreign-language film this year is Brazil's  
``Central Station,'' about an old woman who helps an orphan boy. 
``Central Station'' also received a best foreign language film nod 
and a best actress nomination for Fernanda Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	The Academy Awards will be presented March 21.

<HEADLINE> Wheat, Soybeans Mixed; Corn Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat and soybean futures prices were mixed early  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans faced continued pressure from expectations Brazil will  
harvest a near-record competing crop and ideas American farmers 
this spring will plant more acres to soybeans than corn or other 
crops. That could allow ample stockpiles to grow even more as 
export business remains weak. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by beneficial growing weather for  
the winter wheat crop and weak export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn moved sideways, reflecting stronger-than-expected export  
demand and expectations for a large crop from Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 1/4 cent to $2.54 1/2 a bushel; March  
corn rose 1/4 cent to $2.13 1/4 a bushel; March oats rose 1/2 cent to 
$1.02 a bushel; March soybeans fell 3/4 cent to $4.86 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle rose .03 cent to 66.65 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .07 cent to 73.55 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell .27 cent to 45 cents a pound; March pork bellies rose .45 cent 
to 54.60 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Officials Say IOC Member Was Drunk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- An IOC member expelled in the Olympic  
bribery scandal was consistently drunk as he checked out 
Stockholm's bid for the 2004 Games and got so offensive that he was 
thrown out of a dinner party, Swedish officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan was one of two IOC  
members whose behavior was questioned by Stockholm bid leaders in a 
letter to the International Olympic Committee. A copy of the letter 
was made available to The Associated Press Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC had asked bid cities to detail any cases of improper  
behavior or requests by committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, from bid officials Goeran Laangsved and Olof  
Stenhammar, said none of the members who visited Stockholm violated 
IOC guidelines, but singled out Gadir and Lamine Keita of Mali for 
``behavior ... not up to expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gadir and Keita were ousted from the IOC last month after being  
implicated in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Gadir was ``more or less constantly under the influence of  
alcohol during his visit to Stockholm,'' in July 1997, the letter 
said, adding that he offended several guests at a dinner at 
Stenhammar's residence and was asked to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	It also noted that Gadir ordered expensive alcohol from hotel  
room service. A Swedish newspaper reported last week that a single 
room-service delivery of alcohol to Gadir's room totaled $470. 
</P>
<P>
	Keita asked the bid committee to pay him in cash for a  
round-trip air ticket between Bamako, the Mali capital, and Paris, 
the letter said. The bid committee had bought such tickets and sent 
them by courier to Keita, but he claimed he had not received them, 
the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedish national prosecutor's office, meanwhile, has  
launched an investigation into the bid committee's activities. That 
followed a report that the panel provided $200,000 for an athletes' 
exchange program the Swedish Olympic Committee signed with six 
African countries days before the IOC voted on the site for the 
games. Athens won that vote in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers also said the bid committee paid for medical care for  
several IOC members or their spouses. The bid committee said in the 
letter that those were cases of emergency needs, which it was 
obliged to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The president of the International Skiing Federation said  
winter sports officials want a major role in choosing Winter 
Olympic host cities. Gian-Franco Kasper said at least half of the 
choice of Olympic sites should be based on sports. He said it was 
``the only way to restore the credibility'' of the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The chief of the Sydney Olympics said the IOC should bear a  
share of cutbacks if the 2000 Games fall short of their marketing 
target. Sandy Hollway ruled out renegotiating the Sydney Organizing 
Committee's deal that guarantees the Australian Olympic Committee 
$65 million, regardless of the financial outcome of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Former Australian Olympics Minister Bruce Baird said Sydney  
newspapers made a secret deal not to report on the lavish wooing of 
IOC members in the city's successful bid for the 2000 Olympics. 
Newspaper officials vehemently denied the allegations.

<HEADLINE> McDonald Signs With Devil Rays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Right-hander Ben McDonald, sidelined  
nearly two years because of shoulder problems, agreed Thursday to a 
minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald, the No. 1 overall pick in the 1989 amateur draft,  
would be guaranteed $450,000 if he makes the major league roster. 
McDonald, who has not pitched since July 16, 1997, is 78-70 with a 
3.91 ERA in nine seasons with the Baltimore Orioles and Milwaukee 
Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Devil Rays began spring training, they learned outfielder  
Quinton McCracken has a sprained right knee that will sideline him 
four to six weeks. The injury occurred during an offseason 
conditioning workout at his Arizona home. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald, 31, has undergone surgery twice to repair a torn  
rotator cuff and cited Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild's 
experience handling pitchers as one of the reasons he was 
interested in joining the Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	His contract, which includes an invitation to major league  
spring training, guarantees him a base salary of $200,000 and a 
$250,000 buyout of a $5.5 million team option for 200. 
</P>
<P>
	He would get a $200,000 bonus if he's on the opening day roster  
and could earn an additional $2 million in performance and roster 
bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald was Milwaukee's opening-day starter in 1997 and made 21  
starts before his season-ending injury. He set a career high for 
wins with 14 in 1994, finishing a three-year stretch in which he 
won 40 games for the Orioles.

<HEADLINE> Linux May Be Threat to Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Linux may sound more like a ``Peanuts'' cartoon  
character than a serious operating system for business computers. 
But fast-growing demand for the free software may signal an 
important new threat to Microsoft Corp., the dominant computer 
software maker. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest sign of acceptance, International Business  
Machines Corp. announced plans Thursday to start selling powerful 
business computers that come pre-loaded with Linux, a version of 
the Unix operating system that is used by companies for tasks such 
as running networks of smaller computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was viewed a major endorsement of the fledgling  
software, and comes after similar moves by Compaq Computer Corp., 
Dell Computer Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Silicon Graphics Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	During the past year, Linux has risen to the forefront among the  
relatively unknown products that can substitute for established 
Unix programs and, more importantly, for Microsoft's dominant 
Windows NT software program for corporate computers. Linux 
comprised about 17 percent of the software shipped for running 
business machines last year, up from 7 percent in 1997, says 
International Data Corp., a high-tech research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Linux has come out of almost nowhere and quickly become the  
darling of certain elements of the programming community,'' said 
Tim Bajarin, president of the Creative Strategies Inc. consulting 
firm, based in Campbell, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it remains to be seen if Linux breaks out of its status  
as a niche product and spurs mass demand among customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Users rave about Linux's positive attributes, such as its  
tendency not to crash and its flexibility. Developed in the early 
1990s by a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds, Linux can be 
downloaded for free off the Internet, or bought in commercial 
versions from distributors such as Red Hat Software for as little 
as $50. And unlike Microsoft's software blueprints, Linux's source 
code is shared over the Web, which makes it easy for programmers to 
blend in improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, a small cottage industry of developers around the  
globe has sprung up. But there still are relatively few software 
applications that run on the Linux system, particularly compared to 
Windows-compatible programs. One exception: Corel Corp., a major 
Toronto software maker, plans to sell a package of business 
software, including Word Perfect, made for Linux computers. 
</P>
<P>
	While systems administrators and programmers at companies  
increasingly are embracing Linux, many corporate managers are 
heavily committed to Microsoft through growing investments in 
Windows for desktop computers and Windows NT for business machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The momentum for Windows and Windows NT is extremely strong,''  
Bajarin said. ``Microsoft is not going to give up any territory 
without a major competitive fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, demand for Linux is exploding. The Burlington Coat  
Factory Warehouse Corp. is buying about 1,300 Linux computers this 
year for managing inventory and performing other tasks at its 250 
discount clothing stores, chief information officer Mike Prince 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The machines are replacing other Unix computers, Prince said,  
``but the alternative would have been Windows NT.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Scott, director of information technology at Corning Inc.,  
was more skeptical. He said Corning researchers currently were 
running Linux on just two of the company's 3,000 computers. 
</P>
<P>
	But at Bristol Hotels &AMP; Resorts, a Dallas-based chain of 120  
hotels, technicians use about half-a-dozen Linux computers to 
develop Internet software that will perform such tasks as letting 
hotel guests make reservations online. The company hopes to vastly 
increase its use of Linux as the Internet becomes more important to 
its business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very, very hopeful that the user community in the world  
will recognize this as an alternative and choose to embrace it,'' 
said Joshua Norrid, director of application development at Bristol, 
which uses about 4,000 computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Microsoft faces strong competition has become an  
important issue in its unfolding antitrust trial in Washington, 
which accuses Microsoft of unfairly squelching rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft stock, which has been under pressure because of the  
long-running trial, fell 2.8 percent Thursday as IBM announced its 
support of Linux, dropping $4.25 to $145.75 a share on the Nasdaq 
Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, through a spokesman, was quick to reiterate its  
contention that rivals to its business are alive and well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, it's a competitive threat,'' Microsoft spokesman  
Adam Sohn said of Linux. ``We are happy to compete head-to-head 
with Linux on the merits of the technology and the business 
model.''

<HEADLINE> 'Sweeps' Month Makes TV a Circus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Sweeps'' time, when networks unleash their  
best material in a desperate bid for ratings, is under way, and 
Thursday was another night to fire up the VCR: George Clooney's 
departure from ``ER'' aired against the finale of Stephen King's 
``Storm of the Century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Television executives are talking about changing sweeps, since  
there's a growing suspicion the periodic avalanche of miniseries 
and special events has something to do with declining viewership 
during other parts of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like sweeps programming actually hurts network  
television in general,'' said Leslie Moonves, president of CBS 
Television. 
</P>
<P>
	Four times a year -- in February, May, July and November --  
Nielsen Media Research sends out diaries to participating families 
to measure viewership in local markets. The data is used to set 
local advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	To please their affiliates and boost ratings, networks tend to  
concentrate their best programming during these periods. 
</P>
<P>
	That means a logjam of ``extra special events.'' On Feb. 7, for  
instance, an NBC miniseries, ``The '60s,'' a CBS movie, ``Night 
Ride Home,'' and a key episode of ``The X-Files'' on Fox were shown 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, if we didn't have sweeps, I think these three events,  
which were all worthwhile, could be on not opposite each other and 
it would be better for the business,'' Moonves grumbled in a CNBC 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeps is when you'll see the wildest and most shocking Fox  
reality specials. Even NBC got into the act Wednesday with 
``Confirmation: The Hard Evidence of Aliens Among Us?'' 
</P>
<P>
	If something momentous happens in the lives of your favorite  
fictional characters, chances are it's a sweeps month. The Camden 
twins arrived this month on ``7th Heaven,'' Jill undergoes a 
hysterectomy on ``Home Improvement,'' Jack comes out as homosexual 
in ``Dawson's Creek,'' and, yes, Doug Ross is leaving the ER and 
NBC's top-rated show. Guess which month Ellen used to declare her 
homosexuality? 
</P>
<P>
	ABC hopes to cap off the February sweeps with an event sure to  
grab everyone's attention: an interview of Monica Lewinsky by 
Barbara Walters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeps fever may explain ABC's decision last week to run  
promotional announcements for ``Storm of the Century'' in a written 
crawl on the screen during other prime-time shows. It confused 
viewers who thought they were seeing a special report and angered 
producers who considered it a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's jammed,'' said Dorothy Swanson, president of Viewers for  
Quality Television. ``You have to put one VCR to work here and 
another VCR to work there. It sort of makes up for the mediocrity 
that runs during the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just gotten resigned to knowing we have to wait until  
sweeps to see something interesting,'' she said. ``They don't want 
to waste it in October or December or March.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More often, viewers are left with reruns during non-sweeps  
months, even if it's not summer. A recent New York ad agency study 
found resentment of this pattern was causing viewers to flee to 
cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks and Nielsen are studying plans to change the system.  
One idea is to expand the time when data is collected into eight 
months instead of four, forcing the networks to spread out their 
best shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Another proposal is to eliminate the diary measurements in favor  
of computerized ``people meters,'' which now measure nightly 
ratings in major metropolitan markets. But this would be 
considerably more expensive for the networks and affiliates that 
pay for Nielsen's service, company spokesman Jack Loftus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, local stations that are doing well in the ratings now  
have no incentive to change a system that's working for them, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks, meanwhile, already are preparing for the May sweeps.  
On tap are final episodes for shows like ``Home Improvement,'' 
``Mad About You'' and ``The Nanny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think sweeps are an endangered species,'' said David  
Poltrack, chief CBS researcher, ``but I think it will take years to 
do.''

<HEADLINE> EPA Seeks Big Cut in SUV Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Utility Vehicles%%xhl)%2( 	
<P>
                       %) *By H. JOSEF HEBERT 	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tougher air pollution requirements, soon to be  
proposed for cars and for the first time sport utility vehicles, 
could dictate not only the quality of the air but the kind of cars 
people will drive for decades to come. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency, after weeks of discussions  
with auto makers, is expected to submit a draft of the proposed 
regulations within days for final review by the White House, 
government and private sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new anti-pollution package also would require oil companies  
to produce cleaner gasoline nationwide by cutting sulfur content by 
better than 90 percent. Sulfur inhibits the efficiency of vehicle 
pollution-control equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Tighter pollution rules for both motor vehicles and gasoline,  
which would begin to be phased in in 2004, would be key in 
determining how states meet federal air-quality goals and the types 
of vehicles motorists will drive over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA officials refused comment, pending the review of the  
proposal by the White House Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
	But industry and environmental sources briefed on the draft  
proposal called the tougher automobile standards essential to 
meeting federal air-quality goals, including new health standards 
for smog and microscopic soot. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA proposal specifies nationwide tailpipe emission  
standards similar to those already adopted for 2004 by California. 
Vehicle fleets would have to reduce emissions of smog-causing 
chemicals by almost 90 percent from those of today's vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would require for the first time that sport utility  
vehicles, pickups and minivans meet essentially the same emissions 
caps as cars, although they would be given two more years of 
phase-in time. 
</P>
<P>
	While Ford has touted its line of SUVs as being as clean as  
today's cars, many of the larger SUVs emit three to four times as 
much smog-causing pollution as cars, environmentalists say. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA officials have told auto and oil industry executives that  
future air quality requirements cannot be met in scores of cities 
across the country unless emissions from cars and light trucks are 
reduced dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an incredibly important decision,'' said William  
Becker, executive director of the association that represents state 
air pollution control officials. ``In many instances it will define 
whether or not areas meet their federal health-based standards for 
smog and other pollutants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cleaner gasoline alone is equivalent to taking off the road  
54 million cars, a fourth of those in use, Becker said. He said the 
tougher tailpipe standards will be like removing an additional 50 
million cars by the year 2020. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation accounts for about 45 percent of smog-causing  
nitrogen oxide pollution and a third of hydrocarbon emissions -- 
both precursors of urban smog -- with cars and light trucks 
representing a large portion of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision will dictate how clean cars will be in the first  
decades of the 21st century,'' said Michelle Robinson of the Union 
of Concerned Scientists. Most important, she said, is that for the 
first time the auto makers will have to make SUVs, pickup trucks 
and minivans, which account for close to half the market, as 
environment-friendly as cars. 
</P>
<P>
	According to sources, the draft proposal, which could be changed  
in negotiations with OMB, would slash nitrogen oxide emissions from 
today's 0.4 grams per mile to 0.05 grams for cars with a 2005-2007 
phase-in. Light trucks, including SUVs, would begin the phase-in at 
0.2 grams per mile in 2004 but be required to achieve the same 
reductions as cars by 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the oil companies will have to begin in 2004  
to sell cleaner-burning gasoline with sulfur content averaging 30 
parts per million in all parts of the country. Some small refiners 
may be given longer to phase in production. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil executives said the cleaner low-sulfur gasoline would cost 5  
cents to 6 cents a gallon more to produce. The more stringent 
tailpipe emission requirements may add $160 to $200 to the cost of 
a car, the EPA and the California state agency estimate.

<HEADLINE> Poll Finds Kids Tougher on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Children are tougher on President Clinton than  
their parents when it comes to the impeachment issue, according to 
a new poll done by the Nickelodeon network. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-two percent of children aged 8 to 14 polled last weekend  
by Nickelodeon said Clinton should have been removed from office 
following his impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 40 percent of parents surveyed by Nickelodeon believed  
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be an attitude of `If I do something bad and get  
caught, I get punished.' It probably is just that simple,'' said 
Linda Ellerbee, host of the Nick News program on the youth-oriented 
cable network. 
</P>
<P>
	In another survey taken by Nickelodeon last September, only 26  
percent of children and 11 percent of their parents said they 
wanted to see Clinton impeached and removed from office over the 
Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll also found that three-quarters of the children and  
their parents believe Clinton was an average or better president. 
That's similar to poll results from September and January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps with an eye toward what Clinton has been through, 56  
percent of the children surveyed said they were not interested in 
being president when they grew up. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickelodeon polled 309 children and their parents. The margin  
for error was 5.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Rams Trade Kennison to Saints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Eddie Kennison, who has faltered since his  
rookie season in 1996 was traded Thursday from the St. Louis Rams 
to the New Orleans Saints for a second-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennison, who was the 18th overall pick in the 1996 draft. As a  
rookie, he had 54 receptions for 924 yards and nine touchdowns and 
returned two punts for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennison, who won the NFL's fastest man competition in 1997,  
had 25 catches in 1997 and only 17 for 234 yards and one touchdown 
last season. His speed has been neutralized by jamming tactics at 
the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good move for us, myself included,'' coach Dick  
Vermeil said. ``We have not been able to bring Eddie to the level 
he was at as a rookie. I think he just needed a change where he can 
regain his confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trade gives Kennison, whose big moment last season was a  
punt return for a touchdown, the opportunity to play in his home 
state. He is from Lake Charles, La., and played at Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal as coaches is to get Eddie back to the form he  
displayed as a rookie,'' Saints coach Mike Ditka said in a news 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft choice gives the Rams three of the first 42 picks in  
the draft, April 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams also released defensive tackle Joe Phillips, a 13-year  
veteran. Phillips appeared in 13 games last season, four of them 
starts, but was critical of Vermeil's practice regimen late in the 
season. Vermeil said several weeks ago that Phillips would not be 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennison's trade makes the 1996 draft a disaster for the Rams.  
Their other first-rounder that year, running back Lawrence 
Phillips, was released last November after a series of legal 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Tony Banks, a second-round pick that year, has lost  
his starting job to free agent signee Trent Green and will be 
traded or released. The third-round pick, running back Jerald 
Moore, fumbled away the starting job he took after Phillips was let 
go and was one of the Rams' five unprotected players for the 
Cleveland Browns' expansion draft.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Meets With Labor Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Former Sen. Bill Bradley, saying he  
won't cede ground in the battle for the Democratic presidential 
nomination, sought Thursday to convince organized labor leaders 
that Al Gore doesn't have the race wrapped up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a chance,'' he declared.  
</P>
<P>
	The vice president, who holds a healthy lead in polls and enjoys  
President Clinton's support, wants to foster an atmosphere of 
inevitability about the nomination. One component of that strategy 
is to secure early endorsements from labor groups, the cornerstone 
of any winning Democratic coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	``If your position is inevitability, there's only one way to  
go,'' Bradley said at a news conference following his closed-door 
speech to AFL-CIO leaders. He implied that Gore is going down. 
</P>
<P>
	Two AFL-CIO affiliates -- the Communications Workers of America  
and the International Association of Firefighters -- have already 
thrown their support behind Gore. In a move welcomed by Bradley's 
team, the AFL-CIO executive council passed a resolution Thursday 
urging that no other affiliates follow suit before the panel meets 
in August to consider endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, union and Democratic operatives still expect Gore  
to eventually secure the endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	For Bradley, who arrived in Miami Beach on Wednesday night with  
former Chicago Bulls coach and New York Knicks teammate Phil 
Jackson, the trip was designed to prevent an early stampede of 
union endorsements. Bradley also hoped to show that he will 
challenge Gore every step of the way, even on what should be 
friendly turf. 
</P>
<P>
	``What people want is someone who has a chance to win,'' he told  
reporters. ``The other thing I offer is someone who has a set of 
convictions and is willing to stand behind those convictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley met privately with several union leaders, particularly  
officials upset with Clinton-Gore trade policies. Gore visits 
Friday, his sixth appearance at the annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Mingling with tourists sunning themselves outside the host  
hotel, Bradley said he was pleased with the talks. ``I told them 
about the campaign, told them what I'm doing and told them that I 
have a chance,'' he said during a brief interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Gore's advantages, Bradley's campaign believes that  
Gore's front-runner status is due mostly to his position as vice 
president and that his support is thin among rank-and-file 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Even labor leaders friendly to Gore talked more enthusiastically  
about Clinton than about the vice president. They are comfortable 
with Gore, if not passionate about him. They see him as the likely 
winner, if not their perfect standard-bearer. 
</P>
<P>
	``With (House Minority Leader) Dick Gephardt out of the race,  
people are looking to Gore. People loved Gephardt,'' said Roger 
Tauss, political director of the Transportation Workers Union. 
</P>
<P>
	And Gore has his critics, particularly among industrial unions  
that don't like his free-trade policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why the hell hasn't he stood up there for us?'' asked George  
Becker, president of the United Steel Workers. The union doesn't 
think the administration has moved aggressively enough to stop the 
flood of cheep steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker met privately with Bradley, whose free-trade policies  
also raise eyebrows among union chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Helping make Gore's case, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman  
addressed the executive council in private and told reporters 
afterward the administration will try harder. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is ... a recognition that in certain key industries like  
steel we have to do more,'' she said, also promising that worker 
protection language would be included in any future ``fast track'' 
trade legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior AFL-CIO officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said one reason for the methodical endorsement procedure is to hold 
Gore's feet to the fire. The endorsement is ``a serious bit of 
leverage'' with the administration and its trade officials, one of 
the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's chief of staff, Ron Klain, said the administration has  
created 17 million new jobs nationwide and, ``We're taking the 
trade issues very, very seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And as the Democratic front-runner, Gore is taken seriously.  
Even union bosses troubled by his trade record are treading softly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed'' with his trade policies, said Teamsters  
President James P. Hoffa. ``But, otherwise, he's got a good 
record.''

<HEADLINE> Whitaker Has 'Show Me' Attitude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pernell Whitaker's attitude toward Felix  
Trinidad Jr. is: ``Show me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know anything about him,'' the 35-year-old former  
champion in four weight classes said about Trinidad, who he will 
challenge Saturday night in Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't watched any tapes of his fights. Whatever he has he  
will show me Saturday night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever Trinidad has, Whitaker makes it clear it will not be  
enough to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be trying to beat me, it's just that nobody has,''  
said Whitaker (41-2-1, 17 knockouts), who is convinced he won 
losing decisions against Jose Luis Ramirez and Oscar De La Hoya and 
a draw against Julio Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody has beaten Trinidad (33-0, 28 knockouts), controversially  
or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's father, the champion's trainer, has gone to the  
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've watched them all, especially the last one,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker's last fight, his first after losing the WBC  
welterweight title to De La Hoya, was a 12-round decision over 
Andre Pestriaev. That win was supposed to earn him a shot at then 
WBA champion Ike Quartey, but he tested positive for cocaine and 
ended up in drug-alcohol rehabilitation in 1998, a year in which he 
also got a suspended sentence for reckless driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker won't discuss his out-of-ring problems, although the  
senior Trinidad did -- briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still a good boxer, but the drugs and alcohol have taken  
their toll,'' he said. ``But Whitaker still has pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a little bit slower, but he's still strong,'' the  
champion said of Whitaker. ``He has experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker also is left-handed, but Trinidad said, ``I don't think  
that's any problem. I've fought left-handers before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad, at 5-foot-10, also has physical advantages over the  
5-6 Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The questions about Whitaker are whether his experience can  
overcome the erosion of his talent by age, a long layoff and his 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	In Trinidad's case, it's whether youth, speed, power and pride  
overcome a lack of experience against world-class opposition, 
especially the last four years when he won seven fights in fewer 
than 23 full rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be Trinidad's 12th defense of the title he won by  
knocking out Maurice Blocker in the second round on June 19, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker will be trying to become a welterweight champion for  
the second time. He also has held world titles as a lightweight, 
junior welterweight and junior middleweight. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be televised by HBO, but it will be preceded by a  
rebroadcast of De La Hoya's split-decision win over Quartey on 
Saturday in Las Vegas. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dayton Basketball Player Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Dayton basketball player Nate Green has been  
convicted of one count of misdemeanor assault resulting from an 
Oct. 3 fight on campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Green pleaded no contest Wednesday before Montgomery County  
Common Pleas Judge Barbara Gorman. Gorman found Green guilty and 
set sentencing for March 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a plea agreement with prosecutors, the freshman forward  
would perform a minimum of 100 hours of community service and 
prosecutors would not object to probation. The charge carries a 
maximum penalty of six months in jail or the county workhouse and a 
$1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Green also agreed to testify in any criminal trial involving  
other defendants. A grand jury is still investigating the case, 
said David Franceschelli, assistant prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, of Landover, Md., underwent shoulder surgery in early  
January and played only six games. He declined to comment 
Wednesday. A message seeking comment was left today at the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
	Franceschelli told the judge that Green and at least two other  
men struck freshman James Hennekens while Hennekens was talking 
with a potential basketball recruit. Hennekens, of Red Hook, N.Y., 
no longer is a student at the university. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayton guard Andy Metzler shouted obscenities at Hennekens and  
instigated a fight, while forward Coby Turner attacked Hennekens, 
and Green then hit Hennekens several times in the head, 
Franceschelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hennekens left the party but was followed by Metzler, Green and  
other students, Franceschelli said. Green hit Hennekens again, and 
Hennekens received a concussion and an eye injury, the prosecutor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hennekens' family filed a lawsuit in January against the three  
players and basketball coach Oliver Purnell. 
</P>
<P>
	Metzler's attorney, Alfred Weisbrod, said he found nothing in  
police reports that could involve Metzler in the second assault on 
Hennekens. 
</P>
<P>
	David Williamson, Turner's attorney, declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> N.F.L. Free Agent Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Eddie Kennison and Kerry Collins, once thought of so highly they  
were taken in the first round of the NFL draft, might have found 
new homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennison definitely is headed to New Orleans, which Thursday  
sent a second-round selection in April's draft to St. Louis for the 
wide receiver-kick returner. Collins apparently is headed to the 
New York Giants as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been in discussions the last few days and they are  
ongoing,'' said Leigh Steinberg, Collins' agent. ``Kerry visited 
over the weekend and had a good chance to spend some time with 
coach Jim Fassel, and he did get to meet briefly with the owners. 
He had a real productive and interesting visit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, 26, is looking for something in the area of $3 million  
a year. He was waived by the Carolina Panthers, who made him the 
fifth overall pick in the 1995 draft, on Oct. 13 after telling Dom 
Capers, then the Carolina coach, but since fired, that Collins 
didn't have the heart for pro football. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints signed him, but waived Collins after the season.  
</P>
<P>
	Giants spokesman Pat Hanlon said:  
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't signed anybody and haven't made any announcement to  
that effect. ESPN is reporting it. We don't have any comment on the 
report at this time. I'm not disputing what they're reporting, I'm 
just telling you we don't have any comment on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the ESPN report that the signing is imminent and  
Danny Kanell -- the starter for most of 1997 and '98 -- would be 
waived, Steinberg said, ``They know more than I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennison was the 18th overall pick in 1996 and had 54 receptions  
for 924 yards and nine touchdowns. He also returned two punts for 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	But he combined for only 42 catches the next two seasons and has  
had trouble escaping the line of scrimmage with a defender on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is a good move for us, myself included,'' Rams  
coach Dick Vermeil said. ``We have not been able to bring Eddie to 
the level he was at as a rookie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The draft choice gives the Rams three of the first 42 picks.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rams also released defensive tackle Joe Phillips, a 13-year  
veteran who was critical of Vermeil's unrelenting practice regimen 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota re-signed free agent linebacker Ed McDaniel to a  
five-year deal. McDaniel made his seventh season with the team his 
best, leading the Vikings in tackles and making the Pro Bowl for 
the first time in his career. He has led Minnesota in tackles three 
of the last four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington shored up its secondary by signing safety Sam Shade  
to a four-year, $10.4 million contract with a $2.5 million signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Shade played the last four seasons with Cincinnati.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's an outstanding tackler and special teams player and is a  
combination of everything you look for in a safety,'' Redskins 
coach Norv Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	New England, which lost punter Tom Tupa to the New York Jets  
through free agency, signed veteran Lee Johnson to a three-year, $2 
million dollar contract. Johnson, 37, was fifth in the AFC last 
season with an average 44.7 yards per punt with the Cincinnati 
Bengals. He was cut after criticizing Bengals management in early 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Giants defensive back Carlton Gray signed with Kansas  
City.

<HEADLINE> Colon Screening Rates Still Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Despite easy take-home tests and increasing  
insurance coverage, only about 40 percent of Americans age 50 and 
older are getting regularly screened for colorectal cancer, the 
government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancer of the colon and rectum is the nation's second-leading  
cause of cancer deaths. It is expected to strike 129,400 people in 
the United States this year and kill 56,600. More than 90 percent 
of those stricken are 50 and over. 
</P>
<P>
	The government recommends that every five years, men and women  
50 and older get a colon exam in which a long, flexible tube is 
inserted in the rectum. It also recommends the same age group get 
an annual test for blood in the stool. This can be done with a 
simple, at-home test. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1997 survey of 52,754 people 50 and up, only 30.4 percent  
reported having had a colon exam within the previous five years and 
only 19.8 percent had been tested for blood in their stool in the 
preceding year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
said. Overall, 41 percent reported having one of the tests within 
the recommended time intervals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not seeing much of an improvement in screening rates,''  
said Dr. Laura Seeff of the CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and 
Control. ``It's increased by 2 percent at the most over the last 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Screening for colorectal cancer can cut deaths by as much as a  
third, she said. Medicare coverage was expanded last year to 
include colorectal screenings, and most health insurance providers 
also cover them. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC said that patients may not be aware of the  
recommendations or are afraid of the discomfort and embarrassment, 
and that doctors share some of the blame, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a subject people are comfortable speaking about,''  
Seef said, ``so patients aren't bringing it up to their physicians 
and physicians aren't talking about it either.''

<HEADLINE> Polio Vaccine-Cancer Link Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An American scientist says a London newspaper  
misinterpreted her study of a monkey virus in early polio vaccines 
when the paper said the virus had been proved ``cancer-causing'' 
and could be responsible for hundreds of cancer deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going one step farther than I am prepared to go,'' Dr.  
Janet S. Butel, a researcher at Baylor College of Medicine, said of 
the report in the London Sunday Telegraph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that the evidence is definitive that (the virus)  
causes those (human) tumors,'' Butel said. But she said the 
indirect evidence is getting strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Butel said studies have shown that the monkey virus is present  
in some human tumors and that it can cause cancer in animals. But 
more research is needed to nail down the role, if any, the virus 
may play in causing human cancers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Telegraph article said the monkey virus that contaminated  
pre-1963 polio vaccinations was ``cancer-causing'' and might be 
responsible for hundreds of cancer deaths a year among people 
inoculated with the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper based its report on Butel's study published last  
month in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Butel said the story also was ``misleading'' when it blamed  
contaminated polio vaccine for the spread of the monkey virus. The 
virus may have infected humans from a variety of sources, and it 
may now be spread by human-to-human contact, she said. It's not 
known how the virus is spread. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no evidence that the virus (found in some human  
tumors) came from the polio vaccine,'' she said. The monkey virus 
has been found in the tumors of people who were not even alive at 
the time the contaminated polio vaccine was used, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In her study, Butel reviewed evidence from her research and from  
others' research about the spread and disease potential of a monkey 
virus called simian virus 40, or SV40. This virus was found to have 
contaminated a polio vaccine introduced in 1955. The contamination 
was only in vaccines used before 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Butel said in the paper that ``the association of SV40 with  
human cancers is currently strong enough to warrant serious 
concern.'' But she said further studies are needed to prove whether 
the virus actually causes cancer in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Butel's conclusions are similar to those expressed by experts  
attending a National Institutes of Health conference on SV40 held 
in 1997. A study by the National Cancer Institute, published last 
month in the Journal of the American Medical Association, concluded 
there has been no increase in a type of cancer that has been found 
in animals exposed to SV40.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lawyers Want Wright To Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Lawyers will not ask a federal judge to  
recuse herself from deciding whether to hold President Clinton in 
contempt for denying under oath that he had a relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on condition of anonymity, sources close to the  
president's lawyers said Wednesday that they will instead argue in 
court against a contempt charge for testimony the president gave 
about the former White House intern in the lawsuit filed by Paula 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	John Whitehead, an attorney for Mrs. Jones, also said that his  
side will not ask U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright -- who 
dismissed Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton 
last year -- to step aside. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett would not say whether he planned  
to ask the judge to step aside. Nor did Bennett say anything 
Tuesday about the contempt issue during a telephone conference 
between the judge and lawyers involved in Mrs. Jones lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	After that conference, Wright issued an order saying she was  
ready to address the contempt issue. Punishments for contempt range 
from a reprimand to a fine or jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright noted in her order that she had contact with a House  
impeachment manager, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., and said she 
would step aside if lawyers asked her to. She said she did not 
believe there was any reason for her to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright also disclosed Tuesday that her law clerk provided an  
affidavit for possible use in the impeachment case. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge first raised the contempt issue in a footnote to a  
Sept. 1 ruling in which she said she was releasing Clinton's 
testimony in a Jan. 17 deposition in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	In raising the contempt issue, Wright said she ``has concerns  
about the nature'' of the president's deposition but made ``no 
findings at this time regarding whether the president may be in 
contempt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the deposition, Clinton said: ``I have never had sexual  
relations with Monica Lewinsky.'' He acknowledged Aug. 17 before a 
federal grand jury -- and again in a nationally televised address -- 
that he had an inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.

of consumer products maker Unilever NV and will be succeeded by 
vice chairman Antony Burgmans. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabaksblat, 61, will have served the Anglo-Dutch company whose  
brands include Lipton tea for almost 35 years, including five as 
its chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	He is stepping down because of the company's mandatory age limit  
which requires a chairman to step down at the annual shareholders 
meeting nearest his 62nd birthday, company officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabaksblat will also retire as vice chairman of Unilever PLC,  
the British branch of Unilever, and will also be replaced in that 
post by Burgmans. 
</P>
<P>
	Burgmans, 52, has been a director of Unilever since 1991 and  
joined the company in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Unilever is one of the world's largest consumer products

<HEADLINE> Gene Linked to Defects Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A gene thought to be responsible for a common  
heart and facial birth defect has been identified by researchers at 
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists report in the journal Science, which is being  
published Friday, that the gene for DiGeorge syndrome has been 
isolated, an important step toward finding new treatments for the 
serious disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Babies born with DiGeorge syndrome, also known as chromosome 22  
deletion syndrome, can suffer malformations in the heart, the face 
and the thymus, a gland that is a key part of the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of UT Southwestern researchers led by Dr. Deepak  
Srivastava found that DiGeorge syndrome could be caused when a 
child lacked one of two genes called UDF1. Genes normally come in 
pairs. The researchers found that of 182 DiGeorge syndrome patients 
examined, all lacked one copy of the UDF1 gene. 
</P>
<P>
	Srivastrava said in a statement that lacking one copy of the  
gene may cause a disruption of the proteins critical for the 
formation of heart and facial structures. 
</P>
<P>
	DiGeorge syndrome affects about one in every 4,000 children. It  
is the second most common genetic cause of congenital heart 
defects.

Flipper, the first black West Point graduate, who was 
court-martialed in 1881, USA Today reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper reported in today's editions that the pardon ceremony

ancient Rome's seven hills, urging the faithful to pray, repent and 
perform acts of charity. ``Lent is a time to walk the path toward 
conversion, to return with a repentant heart to the almighty 
Father,'' the 78-year-old pontiff said during the Mass in Santa 
Sabina Basilica. It was the third consecutive year that the pope 
did not lead the traditional procession. Many Catholics fast, give 
up eating meat and renounce pleasurable habits during Lent, which

weekend. Key to any peace agreement is the deployment of a 
30,000-strong NATO force in the province to ensure the deal is 
implemented. Belgrade's refusal so far to consider allowing such a 
force on Yugoslav territory has been a major roadblock in the 
talks.

<HEADLINE> Steinbrenner Did Love David Wells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Boss is not crazy, just fickle.  
</P>
<P>
	George Steinbrenner really did love David Wells. It's just that  
he loved Roger Clemens more. And the New York Yankees most of all. 
</P>
<P>
	There is not another owner in sports self-assured enough to do  
what Steinbrenner did. It was like sitting at a blackjack table 
holding 18 and saying ``hit me'' when the cards come around. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner already had the best team in baseball. Then he  
found a way to make them just a little bit better. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, most owners would pause and ask themselves: How  
much better, really, does a team that won 125 games and swept the 
World Series have to be? 
</P>
<P>
	The book says stay pat. Instead, George answered the way he  
always has: Hit me. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, not everybody was as comfortable with the decision as  
the decision-maker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give me a couple of days,'' Wells said. ``It's a little tough  
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Small wonder. In the span of a Thursday morning meeting when  
Steinbrenner told Wells in person that the deal had been made, the 
wacky left-hander went from being the toast of New York to just 
toast. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre couldn't have felt much better. Getting  
Clemens, a five-time Cy Young award-winner, can hardly be called a 
consolation prize. But replacing Wells in the clubhouse might turn 
out to be tougher than it is on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some shock in that room right now,'' Torre said with a  
nod toward the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	But he could have been talking about his office, too. For all  
the attention that's focused on Wells, Torre knows it won't be easy 
replacing the other two ex-Yankees on their way to Toronto: Graeme 
Lloyd, who developed into a solid left-handed reliever; and Homer 
Bush, a backup infielder whose speed and defense made him a 
valuable late-inning replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something you have to get used to,'' Torre added. ``That  
is what the game is all about. There are going to be changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But this is a change almost no one saw coming.  
</P>
<P>
	Wells, after all, seemed so much like George's kind of guy. He  
pitched a perfect game, won 18 in all and never, ever ducked 
responsibility. Only last October, before one of the biggest games 
of the postseason, the two sat side-by-side in the clubhouse an 
hour before the game, bonding while the music of Metallica pounded 
in the background. 
</P>
<P>
	They might have seemed like an unlikely pair at that moment, the  
owner in his blazer and white turtleneck, the, potbellied, goateed 
pitcher in a cutoff T-shirt. But what they had in common was more 
important -- a desire to bring New York back a world championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, Steinbrenner felt the same way about Clemens.  
So much so that when Clemens went on the free-agent market, the 
owner made a trip to Texas to convince him to move to New York. To 
prove his sincerity, Steinbrenner even lifted weights with the 
Rocket in his home gym. They didn't come to terms then, but clearly 
were impressed with each other's work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that they're partners, they had better make sure the rest of  
New York feels the same way when next fall rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be a lot of bars going out of business in New  
York,'' predicted David Cone, who often followed Wells in the 
pitching rotation and in clubhouse antics. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won't be forgotten. I'm sure there are mixed emotions among  
the fans. As soon as Rocket throws his first 15-strikeout night at 
Yankee Stadium people will be oohing and wowing, saying what a 
catch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be nice if things work out that way. Success too often  
is a sedative for championship teams. The Florida Marlins won one 
championship, then fired just about everybody who made it happen. 
The Chicago Bulls won six in the NBA during the past decade, then 
simply let everybody walk away. 
</P>
<P>
	George may be meddling, but give him credit for this much: At  
least he's trying. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Starting To Slow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Veteran film editor Donn Cambern wrapped up  
work on Disney's ``My Favorite Martian'' and looked ahead to his 
next job. 
</P>
<P>
	Only there wasn't a next job at the moment.  
</P>
<P>
	After years of tremendous growth, Hollywood is starting to slow  
down, with the big studios cranking out fewer movies, and TV and 
film productions fleeing to Canada and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The causes include soaring production costs, a glutted movie  
market, lower costs in producer-friendly foreign countries and 
fundamental changes -- and new choices -- in the business of 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists and Hollywood boosters insist it's too early to get  
too worried, but the change -- be it a correction, a blip or the 
start of something worse -- is reverberating throughout the 
industry, striking hardest at technicians, crafts people, equipment 
suppliers and other behind-the-scenes workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many times I have about two pictures in front of me. Right  
now, there's nothing in front of me,'' said Cambern, a free-lance 
editor and the new president of the board of the Motion Pictures 
Editors Guild, one of many labor groups sounding the alarm. 
``Everyone is starting to feel the slowdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, Hollywood gets a cold hard look at what more it  
could lose -- and who will take it -- as hundreds of film 
commissioners, from Iowa to Iceland, gather in Los Angeles for 
their annual convention. Through Sunday, they'll all be making 
their best cases to move TV and film production to their areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting comes amid these unsettling signs:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The number of films in wide release, usually the bigger-budget  
motion pictures that generate a larger number of well-paid union 
jobs, last year was at its lowest level in six years; 139 movies in 
wide release, down from 151 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The number of television and movie location production days in  
Los Angeles County, where most of the industry's filming takes 
place, dropped 4.2 percent last year to 45,653 days, compared with 
47,669 days in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An estimated 11,300 acting jobs were lost because of work  
going to Canada. That's on top of the 5,500 jobs lost in the 
1996-1997 season and about 2,600 the season before that, according 
to the Screen Actors Guild. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rentals of cameras, sound equipment and other production gear  
were down 30 percent last year after what a rental industry 
representative called ``a banner year'' in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, still the capital of the entertainment business,  
lawmakers are so concerned about the $27 billion industry that 
they've introduced or are about to introduce three bills to provide 
tax credits and to ease environmental rules for production 
companies that remain in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	But other states are hurting, too. For example, Washington  
state, which has a similar geography and climate as its neighbor to 
the north, has lost significant production to Canada, according to 
Kristina Erickson, project coordinator at the Washington State Film 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult to compete with their economy,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Luring producers with a good monetary exchange rate and federal  
and provincial tax credits, Canada is popular for filming movies of 
the week and miniseries. And while ``The X-Files'' may have gone to 
Los Angeles in a highly publicized move from Canada, many TV series 
are still filmed there. 
</P>
<P>
	And it isn't only Canada that is attracting producers.  
``Baywatch,'' the ultimate California television show with its sexy 
starlets and beach scenes, is leaving Southern California for 
Australia, costing about 100 jobs in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, economists and Hollywood boosters are not convinced the  
industry is anywhere close to being in trouble in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know there's been a slowdown. The magnitude of the slowdown  
-- we have to wait and see,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist for 
the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County. ``Over the 
long term the prospects for Hollywood are good. '98 was definitely 
a year of transition. You'll probably see the transition continue 
into 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patti Archuletta, director of the California Film Commission,  
cautioned the signs of a production slowdown could be merely ``a 
message, a signal we need to pay attention to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She suggested the entertainment industry is in a state of flux --  
``with winners and losers'' -- as a decline in television and movie 
production may be overcome by gains in other entertainment related 
industries, including video games, on-line services and cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe there won't be as many people working in the same types  
of jobs in the future, but I think we're smart enough that there 
will be jobs,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In motion pictures, much of the slowdown, observers say, could  
be simply due to a glut of product. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood went on a movie-making binge in the 1990s, with the  
number of wide-release films soaring from 120 in 1990 to 156 in 
1996, according to ACNielsen EDI Inc., which tracks the box office. 
That means that by 1996, moviegoers had an average of three new 
movies a week from which to choose. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of wide releases declined to 139 last year, but  
that's still far above the 1990 level and doesn't include the more 
limited release films from the thriving independent scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year it's still going to be tremendously competitive, and  
you're still going to see two or three new releases every single 
week of the year,'' said Tom Borys, president of ACNielsen EDI. 
``Are we going into some sort of downward spiral? I don't think 
so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, the public's hunger for films has steadily increased.  
Attendance has risen from just under 1.2 billion in North America 
in 1990 to nearly 1.5 billion last year, according to another box 
office-tracker, Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But eating into higher grosses are the even higher costs of  
making movies. The Walt Disney Co., for example, reported last 
month it had an 18 percent drop in earnings in the last quarter, 
with strong box-office results for ``The Waterboy'' and ``A Bug's 
Life'' offset, in part, by rising film production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	At Disney, which is also feeling the effects of the Asian  
financial crisis and costly new ventures, things have been so tight 
that Chairman Michael Eisner had to settle for a 1998 bonus of $5 
million, nearly half his $9.9 million bonus in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Many studios have reduced output. The number of feature film  
production starts in California declined from 637 in 1997 to 510 
last year, the state Film Commission reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In television, location production days for shows and  
commercials were both down last year in Los Angeles County, 
according to the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was as if you couldn't do anything wrong in 1997,'' said Ed  
Clare, president of the Production Equipment Rental Association, 
which reported a 30 percent drop in rentals despite increased 
business by its Canadian members. ``A lot of these companies built 
their businesses up, added equipment, added employees. When the 
slowdown came, many had to pull the plug.''

<HEADLINE> Tomjanovich Named Olympic Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Rudy Tomjanovich did such a good job coaching replacement  
players that USA Basketball decided to give him a shot with the 
first string. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich was picked Thursday to lead the United States team  
in the Americas Olympic qualifying tournament next summer at San 
Juan, Puerto Rico. The United States must finish first or second to 
qualify for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, NBA players responded to the league's lockout by  
boycotting the World Championships, leaving Tomjanovich, coach of 
the Houston Rockets, to run a team of fill-ins pulled together from 
the CBA and Europe. The United States finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Tomjanovich, will take nine NBA players and three  
college players into the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were part of the field last year,'' he said. ``That was a  
team in the true sense with so many heroes who did their part. 
There were so many negatives. They could easily have failed. They 
pulled together and made a positive out of it. Those kids stepped 
up. We got a couple of nice victories and had a shot to win. It was 
gratifying. This summer will be a different deal. We'll be the 
favorites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich's team will be picked by USA Basketball's selection  
committee. ``I'm confident we'll have not only a talented team but 
one with chemistry with players who can score inside or outside and 
with some penetrating slashers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very honored to have been selected. It's an opportunity  
that doesn't come very often. I'm blessed to have a second 
opportunity. My experience was one I'll always remember. We took 
what we had an did the best we could. It's something I will cherish 
for the rest of my life and to have another opportunity is not only 
an honor but a great responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The qualifying tournament runs from July 14-25 and will include  
four teams from South America, three from Central America, Canada, 
Puerto Rico and the United States.

<HEADLINE> License Photo Co. Got Federal Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A New Hampshire company trying to build a  
national database of driver's license photographs received $1.46 
million and technical assistance from the Secret Service last year, 
a company official confirmed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorna Christie, spokeswoman for Image Data LLC of Nashua, N.H.,  
said nearly all the money was for the company's database project 
and a small portion was used by the Secret Service to pay travel 
and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is trying to build a photo database that retailers  
could use to prevent check fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The Secret Service money came as a surprise to officials in  
South Carolina, which had agreed to sell millions of driver's 
license photos to the company. Attorney General Charles Condon, who 
opposed the sale because of privacy concerns, said states should 
have been told that the Secret Service had a hand in the project 
and was considering law-enforcement uses for the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for an investigation into why Image Data didn't tell  
state officials about the federal interest in the database. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now find out that this out-of-state operation was really  
busy getting nearly a million-and-a-half-dollar grant from the 
Secret Service to develop technology for anti-terrorist techniques 
and to discover immigration violations,'' Condon said today in a 
statement. ``Why were state officials not told?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Image Data denied that it misled states about how it intended to  
use the photographs and said that the contracts it signed with 
states specify that the photos can only be used for fraud 
prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The facts are that Image Data use of information is governed  
by both law and by contract,'' said the company's statement. ``We 
sign contracts with states to limit our use of the information only 
for fraud prevention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post, which first reported the funding today,  
said eight members of Congress helped arrange for the company to 
receive the Secret Service money. 
</P>
<P>
	It quoted a September 1997 letter from the Congress members that  
said Image Data's ``TrueID technology has widespread potential to 
reduce crime in the credit and checking fields, in airports to 
reduce the chances of terrorism, and in immigration and 
naturalization to verify proper identity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also said: ``The Secret Service can provide technical  
assistance and assess the effectiveness of this technology.'' Among 
the lawmakers signing the letter were Sen. Judd Gregg and Rep. 
Charles F. Bass, both R-N.H., and Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	A South Carolina judge last week rejected that state's attempt  
to halt on privacy grounds the sale of its driver's license photo 
images to the company. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina's Public Safety Department sold 3.5 million  
driver's license photos to Image Data for $5,000 to test the 
company's system for confirming a customer's identity when a credit 
card or personal check is used. The state then sued the company to 
get out of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	A Florida judge blocked a similar Image Data deal there and  
Colorado's governor wants to do the same.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T-TCI Merger Wins FCC Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T's planned merger with cable giant TCI,  
which could dramatically change how people get local phone and 
Internet services, has won federal regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission, concluding Wednesday that  
the merger was likely to benefit consumers, didn't impose any major 
conditions on the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Local phone competition has focused mostly on high-volume  
business customers, but the merger holds the promise of providing 
residential customers a new choice for local service. It also 
offers consumers one-stop shopping for local calling, Internet 
access and long-distance service -- all over their cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am optimistic because the combined resources of AT&AMP;T and TCI  
surely will generate a very substantial effort to expand the 
choices now available to residential phone subscribers,'' said FCC 
Chairman Bill Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC did not force AT&AMP;T and Tele-Communications Inc. to  
provide other companies with access to TCI's high-speed cable TV 
lines. Consumer groups, America Online and others had pressed the 
agency to require AT&AMP;T to give other companies access to those 
lines to offer competing Internet or phone services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the early stage of deployment of cable's high-speed  
Internet access services, it would be imprudent to act now,'' 
Kennard said. The commission concluded that the merger would not 
harm competition for Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, meanwhile, will continue to lobby regulators and lawmakers  
on Capitol Hill to provide rival companies with access to TCI's 
high-speed lines as well as those controlled by other cable 
companies, said AOL spokeswoman Kathy McKiernan. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the merger, AT&AMP;T will control TCI's stake in AtHome  
Corp., a leading provider of high-speed Internet access. Consumer 
groups have said AT&AMP;T could charge extra if customers got Internet 
service over the merged companies' lines and wanted another 
Internet service provider, such as AOL. But the commission did not 
set any conditions on that part of the deal, either. 
</P>
<P>
	A pleased AT&AMP;T expects to close the merger, valued at nearly $32  
billion when it was announced last year, by March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers Union's  
Washington office, insisted that ``most consumers won't see 
benefits because the merged company is likely to serve only 
high-end customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said, however, he has a commitment from AT&AMP;T to ``offer  
service uniformly in all neighborhoods in every city it serves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kimmelman also is worried that the merged company might raise  
cable TV rates to help finance local phone and other new ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is the nation's largest telecommunications company. TCI is  
the nation's second-largest cable TV company, with lines that reach 
one-third of U.S. homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of TCI's lines have been upgraded to permit cable TV  
customers to connect their computers to the Internet at speeds much 
faster than regular telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, AT&AMP;T intends to make TCI's lines capable of  
providing customers with local phone service, too. AT&AMP;T has a 
separate agreement with cable company Time Warner to provide local 
phone service over its high-speed cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable agreements would give AT&AMP;T a way to get into homes  
without having to rely on phone lines controlled by the regional 
Bell companies, which dominate the local phone market.

<HEADLINE> Man Admits Passing On AIDS Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man suspected of passing the AIDS virus to at  
least a dozen young women admitted Thursday that he knowingly 
exposed a 15-year-old girl to the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Nushawn Williams, who is HIV-positive, pleaded guilty to  
first-degree reckless endangerment for having unprotected sex with 
a New York City high school student, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson  
wouldn't say whether the girl, whose name wasn't released, had 
contracted the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is serving a one- to three-year prison sentence for  
selling crack cocaine in the Bronx. He could receive a maximum of 
two to seven years when he is sentenced on the endangerment charge 
April 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 21, admitted he had unprotected sex with the teen in  
May, 1997, eight months after he tested positive for HIV, Johnson 
said. Authorities wouldn't say whether the girl has tested positive 
for the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Williams' partners were teens he allegedly seduced with  
crack before he was jailed on the drug charge on Sept. 22, 1997, 
authorities said. No criminal charges have been filed in those 
cases.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Veterans Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Less than three weeks after appearing in the Super Bowl, Steve  
Atwater and Cornelius Bennett were released by their NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater, who played in three Super Bowls and eight Pro Bowls,  
was not stunned by being cut. At 32, he was replaced on passing 
downs this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like this is a big shock to me,'' said Atwater, one  
of the best tacklers at safety in the game. ``When they were taking 
me out of games, that said something right there. They had needs to 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing but great things to say about my time in  
Denver. It was 10 great seasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater was released one day after Denver signed cornerback Dale  
Carter to a six-year, $38 million contract with an $8 million 
bonus. Denver needed salary cap room and cut Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, a No. 1 pick of the Kansas City Chiefs in 1992, made  
four straight Pro Bowls (1994-97) and is expected to start in place 
of cornerback Darrien Gordon, in whom the Chiefs have showed 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you can see, we're very serious about a three-peat,''  
Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said of the acquisition of Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have one of the best tandems in the league,''  
Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski said of Carter and Ray Crockett. 
``You can't believe what that does for a defense when you have two 
corners like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, who played linebacker for the Buffalo Bills in all four  
of their Super Bowl defeats in the early 1990s, helped Atlanta get 
to the NFL title game in January. The Falcons lost to Denver 34-19. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time Pro Bowler led the Falcons in tackles, but he is  
33 and would earn $3.7 million for the final year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons also want to make room for last year's top draft  
pick, Keith Brooking, who played regularly in passing situations at 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta also released offensive lineman Dave Widell and saw  
safety Devin Bush sign a four-year contract with the St. Louis 
Rams. Bush was a first-round selection in 1995 and started 36 games 
in his NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
	Another veteran looking for work is wide receiver Chris  
Calloway, who was cut by the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my two years here, this was the toughest move I've had to  
make,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said. ``We've improved the quality 
and the depth at the receiving position. That, along with the 
salary cap, forced us to go in this direction. Chris is a true 
professional and I wish him nothing but the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calloway, 30, would have earned just over $1 million this  
season, including a $500,000 roster bonus due on March 1. A starter 
since 1993, Calloway had 62 receptions for 812 yards and six 
touchdowns this season, all team highs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have had a good career with the Giants,'' Calloway said. ``I  
appreciate my time here and the opportunity the organization gave 
me to play. I hope to continue to play somewhere this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Middle linebacker Corey Widmer will be back with the Giants  
after signing an $11.2 million, four-year deal. Widmer became a 
starter in 1996 and last season he finished with 85 tackles, a 
fumble recovery and five passes defended. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very important to me to stay here,'' said Widmer, a  
seventh round draft choice in 1992. ``It meant a lot that I can 
stay here and continue my relationship with this organization and 
its fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One quarterback he might face in the NFC East is Doug Pederson,  
who joined Philadelphia for $4.5 million over three years. Pederson 
was Brett Favre's backup in Green Bay and worked with Eagles coach 
Andy Reid, who was quarterbacks coach for the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson, 31, has never started an NFL game and has thrown just  
32 regular-season passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big step,'' said Pederson, who joins a team that used  
three quarterbacks last season -- Koy Detmer, Rodney Peete and Bobby 
Hoying. ``You can't turn away from that. But I'm ready. I'm willing 
to take that step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Clyde Simmons, whose 114 career sacks are 10th in  
NFL history, signed a two-year, $4 million deal with Chicago. 
Simmons, 35, started all 16 games for the Cincinnati Bengals in 
1998 and finished with five sacks, second-best on the team, and 30 
tackles. He made the Pro Bowl twice with Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Steamboat Sinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A man laid off from his job on the Belle  
of Louisville, the oldest-running passenger steamboat in the 
country, was convicted Thursday of trying to sink it. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan Callan, 32, could get as much as 20 years in prison for  
his attempted sabotage of a ship that has been a fixture along 
Louisville's waterfront for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	A student at the University of Louisville, Callan worked in the  
engine room of the steamboat on a seasonal basis and was angry he 
had not been rehired in 1994, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	They said he slipped on board one night in August 1997 and  
opened a valve that flooded the ship's hull, submerging the stern. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people crowded the shore when word spread that the  
Belle was sinking. The 85-year-old steamboat offered rides and 
every spring raced another steamboat, the Delta Queen, as part of 
the festivities leading up to the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship has since been repaired and is running again.  
</P>
<P>
	Callan was charged with endangering a ship even though no one  
saw him do it, and there was no fingerprint evidence against him. 
However, he did not take the stand to explain his whereabouts. He 
was to remain free until his sentencing in May.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Pardon Former Slave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THOMASVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- In his last two years at West Point, not  
one cadet spoke to Henry O. Flipper, a campaign of silence that 
failed to destroy his drive to become the school's first black 
graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	Flipper persevered against the shunning, and the former slave  
persevered until his death at the age of 84 against the apparently 
racially motivated charges that led to his dishonorable discharge. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 60 years after Flipper's death, President Clinton was to  
pardon the Army's first commissioned black officer at a ceremony in 
Washington tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Gen. Colin Powell, who kept a photo of Flipper on his  
wall while serving as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was 
expected to attend along with other black officers and Flipper's 
descendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Thomasville, the town near the Florida-Georgia line  
where Flipper was born and is buried, said Thursday that the 
posthumous honor was long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those heartwarming stories where, despite hard  
times, things come out right in the end,'' said Tom Hill, curator 
of the Thomasville Historical Society's museum. ``He was a 
phenomenal person. I'm thankful he's finally getting his just 
due.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign to restore Flipper's reputation began in the late  
1970s in Thomasville, where the new post office, a park and a room 
at the public library are named for Flipper. 
</P>
<P>
	Flipper was the sixth black to enter West Point, but the first  
to graduate. He roomed with another black cadet when he began in 
1873 at 17, but by his junior year he was the only black at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating 50th in a class of 76, Flipper was assigned to  
the 10th Cavalry, the ``Buffalo Soldiers,'' one of two all-black 
units in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Flipper served in a number of combat assignments on the frontier  
before transferring to Fort Davis, Texas. In 1881, his commanding 
officer accused him of failing to account for commissary money. 
</P>
<P>
	A court-martial acquitted Flipper of embezzlement but convicted  
him of conduct unbecoming an officer. Reviewing the record, the 
judge advocate general of the Army concluded that Flipper had been 
singled out because of his race. 
</P>
<P>
	The final decision rested with President Chester A. Arthur, who  
refused the recommendation for leniency and confirmed the 
conviction. The mandatory penalty was a dishonorable discharge, 
which came in 1882. 
</P>
<P>
	Flipper later served seven years as a special agent for the  
Justice Department, joined the staff of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee as an expert on political developments in 
Mexico and was special assistant to the secretary of the Interior 
Department, determining where railroad lines should be built in the 
Alaska Territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had he stayed in the Army, he would have just been a footnote  
in history,'' Hill said. ``As it was, he used his education and cut 
a swath through history that few people have ever done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all his accomplishments, Flipper died disappointed in  
1940 because he was never able to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray MacColl, a teacher who died in 1994, learned about Flipper  
while taking a black history course and embarked on a campaign to 
right what he regarded as a major injustice. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of Flipper's family, MacColl persuaded the Army to  
exonerate Flipper in 1976. But the Army could not reverse Arthur's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is granting this pardon to correct a past  
wrong,'' a White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Hadley, 62, a retired Air Force senior master sergeant who  
has been leading a campaign for a Flipper commemorative stamp, said 
the former slave can be a role model for today's youth. 
</P>
<P>
	``He worked hard. He struggled,'' Hadley said. ``This should let  
people know that if he made it, they can make it today.''

<HEADLINE> Expos' Brochu a Barrier to Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Montreal Expos chairman Jacques Menard said  
Thursday that new investors led by New York art dealer Jeffrey 
Loria are prepared to buy into the team but said team president 
Claude Brochu was an obstacle to a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Brochu is recognized as the person in charge of the team by  
major league baseball. He has been offered about $10 million for 
his 7.6 percent of the team, which says it can't survive in 
Montreal without a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a catch-22,'' said Menard, who has asked top  
officials in major league baseball to convince Brochu to accept the 
offer. ``We ask them to use their experience to accelerate 
negotiations with Claude. We're confident we will have their 
cooperation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos also asked that a March 6 deadline to have new  
ownership and stadium plans in place be pushed back by a few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the money, we have three stadium proposals and we have  
the marketing plan -- that's the good news,'' said Raymond Bachand, 
head of the union investment fund Fonds de Solidarite. ``The bad 
news is that we're paralyzed by the Claude Brochu situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brochu's office released a statement Thursday afternoon saying  
he had no comment. One director said Brochu was holding out for 
more money if stadium plans fall through and the team is sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Loria, who Menard said was ready to invest about $50 million for  
roughly 50 percent interest in the team, was an unsuccessful bidder 
for the Baltimore Orioles in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Menard said local investors would provide the rest of the money  
needed to refinance the team, which hopes to get a new stadium in 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still need government help,'' said director Jocelyn Proteau  
of the Desjardins credit union group. ``But I think the proposal is 
a lot more reasonable now and that's why we believe it's possible 
for the government to come in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brochu has been unable to help convince government officials to  
finance a ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't come to an agreement in the coming weeks, we might  
have to throw in the towel,'' Proteau said. ``That's why we're 
asking Claude Brochu to be a good citizen and settle this.''

<HEADLINE> Retired Hurricanes Memorable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	From Andrew to Camille to Bob, the list of retired hurricane  
names contains some of America's most memorable and deadly storms. 
</P>
<P>
	The first name to be retired was Carol, which struck North  
Carolina and then turned north to blast New York and parts of New 
England in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more storms that year also joined the banished list: Edna,  
which also hit North Carolina, and Hazel, which blasted the 
Antilles, Haiti and the Bahamas, came ashore in the Carolinas and 
brought flooding as far north as New York State. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew, which blasted the Bahamas, devastated the Miami area and  
then went on to strike Louisiana in 1992, was the costliest 
hurricane in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strongest may well have been Camille, the 1969 storm  
that overwhelmed much of the Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama 
Gulf Coast after striking Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	And residents of New England have many sour memories of Bob,  
whose name was retired in 1991 after a rampage that began in North 
Carolina and ended in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Other retired hurricane names, the year they struck and the  
areas damaged are: 
</P>
<P>
	--1955, Connie, North Carolina; Diane, North Carolina, Delaware,  
Maryland, Virginia and the Northeast; Ione, North Carolina; Janet,

England.

<HEADLINE> Oregon Boasts Own 'Shaq' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Shaquala Williams became ``Shaq'' to friends  
and classmates in grade school, about the same time Shaquille 
O'Neal was throwing down his first monster dunks in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	While her 7-foot-1 namesake revels in the Hollywood spotlight  
with the Los Angeles Lakers, the 5-foot-6 Williams is quietly 
making a name for herself up the West Coast with No. 18 Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	The freshman has gone from little-used backup to dependable role  
player to team leader in just a few months. Since taking over as 
the starting point guard nine games ago, the freshman has averaged 
14 points for the Ducks, who went 8-1 during that stretch and have 
their highest ranking since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``I nominated her for All-American because she's playing like an  
All-American,'' Oregon coach Jody Runge said this week as the Ducks 
prepared for their final home games -- tonight against Arizona State 
and Sunday against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Williams, Oregon isn't often mentioned in discussions about  
the nation's best. But the Ducks (20-4 overall, 11-2 Pac-10) are 
tied with No. 13 UCLA (19-6, 11-2) for first place in the Pac-10. 
If the teams each win their last five games, Oregon would win the 
automatic NCAA tournament bid by virtue of an edge in tiebreakers. 
That would almost assure the Ducks of staying home for the first 
two rounds of the tournament after losing in the first round on the 
road each of the past five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon has been an annual power in the Pac-10 under Runge, but  
it wasn't until Williams began asserting herself that the Ducks 
emerged as the conference's dominant team. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oregon's first 13 games, Williams averaged just 4.8 points  
while shooting just 30 percent from the field. Her breakout 
performance came at Southern California on Jan. 8, when she scored 
14 points in a 77-53 win over the Trojans. At UCLA two days later, 
she played 38 minutes and had 15 points in a 76-72 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did everything a point guard needs to do in that game --  
except win,'' she said. ``But I think it kind of set a standard for 
me as far as what I could be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams replaced sophomore Karen Piers at point guard, and in a  
home game against Washington on Jan. 15, Williams had 25 points on 
10-of-12 shooting and 11 rebounds in the Ducks' 70-56 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	She was nothing short of spectacular in a 106-79 blowout of  
UCLA, then ranked No. 7, at home Feb. 4. She made 11 of 15 shots, 
including 6-of-8 from 3-point range, for 31 points. She also had 
seven assists and played solid defense, a skill that prevented her 
from becoming a starter sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids on this team know that if they don't defend, they don't  
get to play a whole lot,'' Runge said. ``We always knew she had the 
offensive skills, which came early for her. Now she's really 
improved the defensive part of her game and working on her 
leadership skills. That's a huge accomplishment for a freshman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Williams' older brother Michael who named her Shaquala,  
for reasons that are still unknown to her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was sixth grade -- when Shaq came into the league,''  
Williams said of when she first heard her moniker. ``Most people 
couldn't pronounce my name anyway, so they just took the easy way 
out and pronounced it `Shaq.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams played for three different Portland-area high schools  
in four years, and she had a reputation as a selfish player. When 
her first school, St. Mary's, failed to make the state tournament 
her sophomore year, she transferred to Jesuit, an affluent suburban 
school that had a better team but where she feuded with her coach. 
She transferred to Reynolds High in her neighborhood and averaged 
26 points as a senior. But she drew little interest from the big 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came out of high school, everyone said, `Why are you  
going to Oregon? They're not that good,''' Williams said. ``I said, 
`This is a team that can get to the Final Four.' No one believed 
me. Now everything I said is coming true.''

	Prices Jump at Wholesale Level  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wholesale prices had their largest gain in  
more than two years last month, rising 0.5 percent. Big cost 
increases for gasoline, pork and citrus fruit led the way, the 
Labor Department said today. The Producer Price Index,had been down 
0.1 percent for all of last year. But economists saw the hike as a 
one-time event and said little of it will get passed on to 
consumers. Prices excluding the volatile food and energy components 
actually fell for the first time in seven months in January, edging 
0.1 percent lower. In another report, the Labor Department said new 
claims for unemployment insurance rose by 4,000 last week to 
288,000. The four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes 
weekly fluctuations in the volatile data series, fell from 298,750 
to 292,000, the lowest in 10 years. 

</P>

	Stocks End higher; Dow Up 103.16

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes moved higher today, supported by  
isolated strength in consumer and financial services issues, but 
the broad market lagged as a recovery in technology stocks proved 
uneven. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 103.16 at 
9,298.63. Broader stock indicators ended moderately higher, with 
the Nasdaq composite up 11.64 at 2,260.55. But the tone of the 
market again failed to impress traders and technicians, who have 
been complaining for some time that even on days when the Dow 
finishes higher, the trend isn't confirmed across the entire 
market.

	EPA Seeks Big Cut in SUV Pollution  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to dramatically cut air pollution in  
the next decade, the Environmental Protection Agency is set to 
propose tough new requirements for cleaner cars and gasoline. The 
draft proposal could be sent to the White House as early as 
tomorrow, according to government sources. The proposed regulations 
would go into effect in 2004. Sources familiar with the general 
outline say it would require automakers to make sport utility 
vehicles as pollution-free as passenger cars.

	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Dutch insurer Aegon NV is in line  
to become the third largest U.S. life insurer by purchasing 
Transamerica Corp. for $9.7 billion in cash and stock. The 
corporate and insurance operations of San Francisco-based 
Transamerica will merge with Aegon's businesses in the United 
States when the deal is completed this summer, the Dutch company

	ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service's profit rose 37 percent in  
the fourth quarter and 87 percent for the year, citing a profitable 
global expansion and full recovery from a 1997 strike. The company 
benefited from low fuel prices, cost-containment efforts, a 
broadening of products including Web-based document delivery and 
the first annual profit from its international operations. The 
privately held delivery company earned $482 million in the last 
three months of 1998, up from $351 million a year earlier.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite wide interest among outsiders, Comedy  
Central on Thursday appointed its top advertising executive, Larry 
Divney, as new president and CEO of the irreverent cable network. 
Divney replaces Doug Herzog, who left late last year to become the 
top programmer at Fox. Due largely to the popularity of the 
foul-mouthed cartoon cutouts of ``South Park,'' Comedy Central is 
among the most profitable cable networks, beating its ad sales 
projections last year by more than $30 million. It is owned jointly 
by Time Warner and Viacom.

for the year, which included the loss of patent protection for two 
key drugs. The giant drug maker posted 1998 profits of $3.00 
billion, or 85 cents per share, beating Wall Street expectations by 
a penny. In 1997, Glaxo earned $3.02 billion.

	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A British company repossessed two of Kiwi

Friedman, a lawyer who represents Fly Finance 1 Ltd., said today 
the two Boeing 727s were repossessed last weekend, leaving the 
airline with only four planes in the air and two others undergoing 
maintenance. Only one of the two planes had been flying at the

Federal Aviation Administration, which issued the airworthiness

<HEADLINE>  Grizzlies Need Some Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Grizzlies are taking the  
long way around this shortened NBA season. 
</P>
<P>
	After beating the Los Angeles Clippers in two overtimes Tuesday  
night, Vancouver flew home to play the Boston Celtics on Wednesday 
and went three overtimes before losing 131-129. 
</P>
<P>
	Ah, youth!  
</P>
<P>
	``This is what I want to do. I'd rather be playing than  
sitting,'' said Mike Bibby, the Grizzlies' rookie point guard who 
logged 54 minutes against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other time a team played five overtimes in two  
consecutive games was 47 years ago, before there was a 24-second 
shot clock. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1951 the New York Knicks and Rochester Royals played  
a single-overtime game, then played four overtimes two days later. 
For the record, the teams split. 
</P>
<P>
	But those games were two days apart. The young Grizzlies did it  
back-to-back early in a season in which teams have been thrown 
together and had trained for just two weeks following the end of 
the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The players said they were more disappointed than tired after  
playing what amounted to more than 2 1/2 games -- 121 minutes in 
playing time -- in 28 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	They blew their chance of winning three straight games for just  
the second time in team history and could have improved to 4-3, 
which would have marked the first time they were over .500 this 
late in the season since 1995-96, their first year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely a tough one for us, especially coming off  
last night,'' center Bryant Reeves said after the Celtics game. 
``We both played in California last night so they were in the same 
situation. We had chances to win and we just didn't capitalize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston coach Rick Pitino, whose team had lost the night before  
in Sacramento, said the game was ``really like a Rocky fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the highlights of Wednesday's game:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Grizzlies, who led 74-64 after three quarters, never  
trailed until 4:10 into the fourth quarter. After that, there were 
17 lead changes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Boston's Dana Barros forced the first overtime when he hit a  
3-pointer with 0.5 seconds left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Celtics led by eight points in the first OT, only to allow  
a 10-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Celtics blew a four-point lead in the final minute of the  
second OT. 
</P>
<P>
	-- And finally, the Grizzlies squandered a four-point lead in the  
final 50 seconds of the third overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics' Paul Pierce cut the lead to 129-127 with a short  
jumper, then Andrew DeClercq put Boston up for good with a 
three-point play with 15.8 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies never got another shot off thanks to Pierce's two  
steals on Vancouver's final two possessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was saying to myself, `I hope we don't go into another  
overtime.' It sort of wears on your legs. I was glad it was over, 
'' said Pierce, who scored seven of his 26 points in the third OT 
and finished with seven steals. ``It was grueling but it was a lot 
of fun to be out there, competing against some of the top players 
in the world. I feel like I'm in Fantasyland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver set a team record for most points in a game, although  
their previous best of 121 points was set in four quarters. The 
Grizzlies also set team records for most free-throws made (45), 
most attempted (50) and the longest game (3:49). 
</P>
<P>
	Shareef Abdur-Rahim, who played 56 minutes, scored a career-high  
39 points, while Bibby scored 23. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no rest for the weary, either.  
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies, off to Minnesota for a game Friday, won't have  
more than one day rest between games until they get a two-day break 
in late April. The Celtics are in the middle of a six-game road 
trip that takes them to Portland on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Taxes Are Taking More Time Than Ever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taxpayers who itemize deductions and have even  
modest investment income will spend almost an entire day figuring 
out their tax returns. The time-consuming chore is just one 
consequence of the increasing complexity of the tax code. 
</P>
<P>
	Filling out the 1040 form, Schedule A for the deductions and  
Schedule D for capital gains or losses will take more than 22 
hours, according to the Internal Revenue Service. Those same forms 
took 19.5 hours last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. tax code now stands at more than 1.5 million words and  
climbing, thanks to 1,260 changes enacted by Congress and signed by 
President Clinton in the last two years alone. The IRS had to 
develop 11 new forms and revise 177 others just for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	For millions of taxpayers trying to do their taxes by April 15,  
the complexity is so daunting they are almost forced to seek 
professional help or a computer software program. A new ad campaign 
by H&AMP;R Block sums up the fear factor: ``We Know. Do You?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major culprit is the trend in the Clinton administration and  
Congress to enact tax credits for various social needs and to 
tinker with such intricate areas as taxes on capital gains from 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time there's a new benefit, it requires an additional  
line to the form and additional forms to compute those credits,'' 
said Sheldon Schwartz, national tax forms and publications director 
at the IRS. ``It's never as easy as we would like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for politicians, the appeal of a tax break far outweighs  
such worries. 
</P>
<P>
	``People will push the complexity into the background,'' said  
Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., a senior member of the tax-writing House 
Ways and Means Committee. ``The credits are politically expedient 
and attractive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, some taxpayers for the first time can get a $400  
credit for children under age 17 and two education credits -- the 
Hope and Lifetime Learning credits -- that provide up to $1,500 and 
$1,000 respectively for certain post-secondary education expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds relatively simple. But taxpayers claiming the child  
credit must complete an 11-line worksheet, and depending on the 
answers, a second 10-line form to determine if they qualify under 
the income limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The education credits require completion of an 18-line form and  
come with their own book of instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	Another area of difficulty is IRS Schedule D, where investors  
must report their capital gains or losses from investments. Even 
small-scale investors must fill out the 54-line form and navigate 
its confusing maze of tax rates for different investments -- which 
changed dramatically in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Most forbidding of all is the alternative minimum tax. Intended  
to prevent the wealthy from escaping taxes through deductions and 
credits, it now threatens more and more middle-class taxpayers 
because its thresholds were never indexed for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	This means millions of taxpayers could be required to calculate  
both their regular taxes and their alternative minimum taxes -- and 
pay the higher of the two. That means completing a 12-line IRS 
worksheet to determine if a taxpayer is affected by the alternative 
tax and then a 50-line form to figure out the amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who mistakenly believe the alternative tax does not apply  
to them could get an unwelcome surprise from the IRS if they don't 
do both calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	For accountants, tax software firms and preparers such as H&AMP;R  
Block, this uncertainty means big business. The Block ``We Know'' 
ad campaign is aimed at giving people confidence that their taxes 
are being done right, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it really means is there are more opportunities to save  
money,'' said Linda McDougal of the Kansas City, Mo.-based firm, 
which last year did one-seventh of all individual income tax 
returns. ``To take advantage, you may need the help of a tax 
professional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leading tax software, TurboTax from San Diego-based Intuit  
Inc., sold 3.3 million copies last year. Buyers ``are looking to a 
trusted source for advice and to help them do their taxes,'' said 
Monica Muilenburg, director of product marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	All this has happened at a time when the same politicians voting  
for the changes are advocating tax simplification. Make the code 
simple enough that returns for most Americans would be the size of 
a postcard, say flat tax advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	That does not appear likely anytime soon. Clinton's new budget  
proposes numerous credits for such things as care for the elderly 
and disabled, stay-at-home parents and disabled workers. Some have 
Republican support.

	DUBUQUE, Iowa (AP) -- Sister Ruth Schiffler has given most of her  
83 years to God, children and the sick, and when she dies, the 
former educator's devotion to others will continue. She is donating 
her brain to researchers trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Sister Schiffler is one of about 86 nuns in the Sisters of  
Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary order in Dubuque and Chicago who 
have agreed to leave their brains to science. 
</P>
<P>
	They are participants in the nationwide Religious Orders Study,  
a $13 million federally funded research project in its sixth year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to know we're giving a lift to humanity. We're  
contributing to society and mankind in a way that we couldn't 
otherwise,'' Sister Schiffler says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Religious Orders Study, funded by the National Institute on  
Aging, is studying older Catholic nuns, priests and brothers who 
have agreed to undergo annual detailed clinical evaluations and 
leave their brains to research when they die. 
</P>
<P>
	The nuns in Sister Schiffler's order and about a dozen  
Dubuque-area priests and the same number of Trappist monks at New 
Melleray Abbey in nearby Peosta, are among 25 religious communities 
in nine states taking part in the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Iowa, participants live in California, Illinois,  
Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, New York, Tennessee and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David Bennett, who heads the study by the Alzheimer's  
Disease Center at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in 
Chicago, says the participants start without the disease and make 
excellent subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about as close as you can get to a controlled  
experiment because their lifestyles are fairly similar to each 
other,'' he said. ``Getting brains from healthy, older people in 
general is pretty difficult because they don't want to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not so among the nuns at Mount Carmel, a retirement home for  
Sister Schiffler's order that sits on 110 acres on bluffs 
overlooking the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has a sense that at the time of death, they're moving  
into eternal life,'' said Sister Mira Mosle, director of public 
relations for the order. ``Our people are very comfortable with it. 
I think there is a general sense that it's one way that people can 
continue to serve others... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, says 85-year-old Sister Mary Eaton: ``After I'm dead,  
the brain isn't going to do me a bit of good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Bennett, one in 10 people over the age of 65 have  
Alzheimer's disease. An estimated five million Americans have the 
disease, with illness rates rising with age: 15 percent of people 
between the ages of 75 and 84, about half of those over 85. 
</P>
<P>
	``People over the age of 65 are the most rapidly growing segment  
of the population of the United States and other industrialized 
nations,'' Bennett said. ``So the number of people with Alzheimer's 
could, in fact, triple by the middle of next century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 667 clergy nationwide are involved in the study.  
Researchers have already received 83 brains. Donating brains is 
only part of the project, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants begin with an evaluation that includes their  
medical history, work experiences, lifestyle, family history, 
neurological and physical performance tests and blood samples. 
</P>
<P>
	Cognitive performance tests are conducted to assess short- and  
long-term memory, language patterns, attention and perception. 
</P>
<P>
	The half-day of tests is repeated each year. Researchers are  
able to detect if any of the participants show signs of Alzheimer's 
and can bookmark, by year, the progress of the disease. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Interview Limits Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's criminal  
investigation is continuing, and he is demanding limits on what 
Monica Lewinsky can say in her first television interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources familiar with negotiations between Starr's office and  
Ms. Lewinsky's legal team said Ms. Lewinsky could be interviewed as 
soon as Saturday by ABC's Barbara Walters. The interview would be 
aired during the February ``sweeps'' period, which ends March 3. 
</P>
<P>
	March 5 is the publication date of ``Monica's Story,'' a  
collaboration between Ms. Lewinsky and Princess Diana biographer 
Andrew Morton. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors and lawyers for the former White House intern were  
still discussing restrictions on the ABC interview Wednesday. A 
number of areas still under investigation are off limits for Ms. 
Lewinsky to discuss, said one of the sources, who would not 
identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	The main restriction is that Ms. Lewinsky cannot go beyond what  
she has said in her numerous published interviews with prosecutors 
and in her grand jury testimony, said the sources. Already on the 
public record are some two dozen interview summaries and testimony 
from her two grand jury appearances and from a sworn deposition at 
Starr's offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky spokeswoman Judy Smith, Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly  
and ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy all declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky needs Starr's permission for the TV interview  
because she agreed to a prohibition against talking to the news 
media in the agreement she signed with the office of the 
independent counsel last July 28. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for promising not to prosecute Ms. Lewinsky, the  
document states that ``pending a final resolution of this matter, 
neither Ms. Lewinsky nor her agents will make any statements about 
this matter to ... representatives of the news media, without first 
obtaining the OIC's approval.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury Starr used to conduct his perjury and obstruction  
of justice probe of President Clinton is meeting twice this week. 
While Starr concluded some time ago that a sitting president is 
indictable, it does not appear that he is gearing up for a case 
against Clinton. One of his deputies has left the office and at 
least one other key prosecutor is preparing to leave, people 
familiar with the prosecutors' plans say. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's testimony conflicts on several points with both  
Clinton and presidential friend Vernon Jordan, who helped line up a 
job offer for her and found her a lawyer when she was subpoenaed as 
a witness against Clinton in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case 
against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky has testified that she tried to make clear to  
Jordan that she had an intimate relationship with the president 
after initially denying having sexual relations with him in 
response to a direct question from Jordan. She also says she 
understood Jordan was telling her to destroy drafts of notes she 
had written the president, but Jordan denies doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	In regard to Clinton, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony conflicts on when  
their intimate relationship started, how many times they engaged in 
such behavior and the details of their encounters. He says he never 
touched her in a sexual manner. She says he did.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Accepts Kansas St. Penalties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas State's football program  
escaped serious NCAA penalty today in the case of a top junior 
college recruit who took money from a booster to buy a used car. 
</P>
<P>
	The Committee on Infractions accepted penalties Kansas State  
already had imposed on itself, and praised the university for its 
quick action after violations were disclosed involving running back 
Frank Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas State had declared Murphy ineligible for four games and  
disassociated itself from the boosters involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA committee did extend by one year the probationary  
period that Kansas State was serving for unrelated violations 
committed in 1994 and 1995 in track and women's basketball. The 
two-year probation was extended until May 31, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once they had knowledge, they reacted quickly and  
decisively,'' said Bonnie Slatton, the acting chairwoman of the 
Infractions Committee. ``They did everything right as far as we 
could see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas State acted after it was notified of the apparent  
violations by a booster who was not involved, quickly reported to 
the NCAA and made a thorough investigation, Slatton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see the committee's announcement as an endorsement of our  
compliance monitoring program and the findings of `no fault' on the 
part of our institution a credit'' to the football staff, athletic 
director Max Urick said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one associated with the athletic department was involved. The  
university might never have known about the violation were it not 
for the booster who reported it, Slatton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy, a top junior college prospect from Garden City, Kan.,  
Community College, took $200 from a booster on one occasion and 
later accepted $3,200 in order to purchase a used BMW. 
</P>
<P>
	A booster solicited the money from other boosters before giving  
it to Murphy. The university said in its report to the NCAA that 
Murphy thought the money came from a friend and did not know it 
came from people with interest in the football program. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy later returned the car and donated $3,400 to charity.  
</P>
<P>
	At Garden City, Murphy rushed for 1,370 yards and 26 touchdowns  
while leading the team to the junior college championship game his 
sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
	He was expected to provide a high-powered combination with  
quarterback Michael Bishop for the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
	But after sitting out the four games, Murphy never became an  
integral part of the offense. He rushed for 257 yards on 55 carries 
and five touchdowns and caught three passes for 91 yards and a 
touchdown. Murphy also returned eight kickoffs for 210 yards.

<HEADLINE> Two Kiwi Planes Are Repossessed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Kiwi International Air Lines is putting some  
of its passengers on other airlines after a British company 
repossessed two of the discount carrier's eight planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fly Finance 1 Ltd. of London took the planes last weekend,  
saying the airline had failed to honor an agreement to buy the 
aircraft by the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
	The tiny upstart airline now has four planes in the air and two  
others undergoing maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one of the two planes had been flying at the time; the  
other was in Canada undergoing an overhaul, Kiwi spokesman Rob 
Kulat said. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers who would have flown on the active plane are taking  
flights on Pan Am and Sun Pacific airlines instead, Kulat said. 
Customers with Kiwi tickets will continue to check their bags at 
Kiwi counters. 
</P>
<P>
	Kulat didn't know how many flights the repossessed plane  
handled. Kiwi makes about 225 flights a week from Newark, Boston, 
Atlanta, Miami, Palm Beach and Orlando, Fla., San Juan and 
Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline, which has struggled to survive since it started  
flying in 1992, is ending service to Boston on Tuesday. The city's 
Logan International Airport has said it would ban the airline by 
then for refusing to pay debts, but Kulat said the airline had 
already planned to pull out of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	It has also ended service to Chicago and Flint, Mich., saying  
the routes were no longer profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kulat said Kiwi is still doing well. It reported a 26  
percent increase in passengers in January from a year ago, to 
58,900. 
</P>
<P>
	Fly Finance, a London-based leasing company that only owns the  
two repossessed planes, had renegotiated a lease with Kiwi shortly 
after the airline emerged from bankruptcy in 1997. The lease, which 
charged about $150,000 a month to rent both planes, expired in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Fly Finance agreed to extend the lease until Jan. 31 in return  
for a $500,000 payment from Kiwi. The company repossessed the 
planes after Kiwi let the deadline pass without buying them at a 
previously agreed-to price of $6.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kulat said Kiwi is still interested in buying the planes.

<HEADLINE> Clemens Lands in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Astros failed to get Roger Clemens once  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really a matter of the Yankees matching up very well  
with Toronto's needs,'' Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said 
Thursday after the Blue Jays traded the five-time Cy Young Award 
winner to New York for David Wells, Graeme Lloyd and Homer Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't argue the quality of players Toronto got back,''  
Hunsicker said. ``They filled three primary needs at the major 
league level: a starter to replace Roger, an everyday second 
baseman and a left-handed reliever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto general manager Gord Ash wanted two young prospects  
Houston owner Drayton McLane wasn't willing to deal: pitcher Scott 
Elarton and outfielder Richard Hidalgo. Right fielder Derek Bell 
also was among the trade possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We, quite frankly, didn't matchup up very well in filling  
their needs,'' Hunsicker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Astros owner Drayton McLane thought as late as Wednesday he  
still had a chance to obtain Clemens, a Houston native who wanted 
to be traded either to a contender or closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought all along that the deadline would be Thursday or  
Friday this week,'' McLane said. ``We worked aggressively through 
Gord Ash. We thought we were getting awfully close. We felt good 
Tuesday and Wednesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement ended a drama that started Nov. 27, when  
Clemens exercised a clause in a side agreement between himself and 
former Blue Jays president Paul Beeston, now chief operating 
officer of the commissioner's office. The agreement allowed him to 
demand a trade at any time. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens withdrew the trade demand Dec. 22, criticizing Hunsicker  
for blasting his request for a $27.4 million, one-year contract 
extension, which would have left the Astros owing him $43.5 million 
over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens did not get an extension to his Yankees contract, which  
has two years to run and calls for him to be paid $16.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, a 36-year-old right-hander, might be changing uniforms,  
but he's not changing addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family will be raised right here in Houston. This will  
always be home,'' he said. ``They love New York too, even though 
it's a more laid back situation here in Houston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It remains to be seen whether the deal will help the Yankees,  
seeking their third World Series title in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very difficult to improve a team that won 125  
games,'' Hunsicker said, ``but having said that, there aren't many 
pitchers who have won more than Roger Clemens.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers Hampered by Ailments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A variety of injuries and ailments left the  
Los Angeles Lakers with only eight players able to practice 
Thursday. One of them wasn't Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have any,'' spokesman John Black said when asked if  
there was an update on the Rodman situation. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if anyone connected with the organization has spoken  
with Rodman, Black replied, ``Not other than (team owner) Jerry 
Buss, no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black did say Buss and Rodman met Wednesday night, but wouldn't  
say where or how long the meeting lasted. 
</P>
<P>
	Contrary to media reports, Black said, vice president of  
basketball operations Jerry West had not had ``any direct contact'' 
with Rodman as of the end of the business day Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if the Lakers planned to deliver an ultimatum to the  
eccentric 37-year-old seven-time NBA rebounding champion, Black 
said, ``Not at this point, we're not going to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, the saga continues. The Lakers first expressed an interest  
in Rodman more than two weeks ago, and it was reported last weekend 
he had decided to play for them. However, no contract had been 
signed as of Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	West was unavailable for comment, but told ESPN he was ``furious  
with the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers can only sign Rodman for the veterans' minimum of $1  
million, prorated to $600,000 for the shortened season and 
diminishing further with each game he misses. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Del Harris told his players earlier this week he would  
prefer they would no longer answer questions concerning Rodman due 
to the potential distraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that our guys have really been good with the media  
about giving their opinions,'' Harris said after Thursday's 
practice at Los Angeles Southwest College. 
</P>
<P>
	The questions were still asked, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't bother me,'' veteran point guard Derek Harper said  
when asked if he was upset that the Rodman situation remained 
unresolved. ``I have a certain focus I'm going to keep. Right now, 
that focus is San Antonio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers (5-3) entertain the Spurs (4-4) on Friday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to lose any sleep over it one way or another,''  
Harper said. ``When Worm gets here, if he gets here, he's a 
priority with this team. He's not a Laker. He's not signed with 
anybody. He can do what he wants to do. It's his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the six players who missed practice was Robert Horry, who  
has had to sit out three games due to an irregular heartbeat, and 
will almost surely miss at least four more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robert is feeling better,'' Black said Thursday night. ``Test  
results done today did not indicate any cause. The doctors still 
believe this is being caused by the recent viral infection he 
had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black said the 28-year-old Horry, who was still having extra  
heartbeats, won't play against San Antonio, and won't accompany the 
Lakers on a three-day, three-game road trip that begins Sunday in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be re-evaluated Monday,'' Black said. ``They want him to  
go through a workout Monday wearing a monitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other players missing practice Thursday were Travis Knight, who  
has a sprained ankle but said he expected to play against San 
Antonio; Rick Fox, who has a sore right foot; and rookies Sam 
Jacobson, Tyronn Lue and Ruben Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobson fractured his left ring finger in pregame warmups  
before the Lakers beat Dallas 101-88 on Wednesday night and will be 
placed on the injured list, Black said. Lue has been experiencing 
back spasms, and Patterson has an upper respiratory infection. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we still had a productive practice with just eight  
people,'' Harris said. ``You still have to have a productive 
practice. The guys worked hard. It was not a wasted day.''

<HEADLINE> Guy With Ho Chi Minh Poster Booted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- A shopkeeper whose store has been  
picketed since he flaunted a poster of the late communist leader Ho 
Chi Minh has been ordered to move out by Friday or face further 
legal action. 
</P>
<P>
	Truong Van Tran's landlord served him with a notice that cites  
failure to provide proof of property insurance, worker's 
compensation insurance or liability insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran's store has been the site of protests since mid-January  
when he made an issue of his window display showing Ho and the 
Vietnamese flag. Most of the Little Saigon community's 200,000 
residents are former political prisoners or refugees who despise 
the communist government. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge last week upheld Tran's constitutional right to display  
the artifacts in the window of his store. Tran's landlord had told 
him to remove the picture and flag because they were sparking 
disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
	During the latest protest outside the store on Wednesday, a half  
dozen of the 150 protesters turned on a Vietnam veteran who had 
come to oppose the demonstration. The attackers pushed and shoved 
him to the ground, and at least one man stomped on him. He was not 
seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (protesters) gave their country away,'' said veteran  
Thomas Kochler, as a small trickle of blood dripped from his head. 
``We never let it go while we were there, but when it was their 
turn they ran.''

<P>
	Spring training opened with a stunner today: Roger Clemens was  
traded by Toronto to the New York Yankees for David Wells, Graeme 
Lloyd and Homer Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade stunned the Yankees, coming off a record-setting  
125-win season and barely settled into Legends Field for their 
7 1/2-week spring stay in Tampa, Fla.

not get an extension to his contract, which has two years to run 
and calls for him to be paid $16.1 million. He is to report this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roger Clemens is a non-stop Hall of Famer,'' Yankees manager  
Joe Torre said. ``The last two years, what he's done, it's 
incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, a quirky left-hander known as ``Boomer,'' was the toast  
of New York after pitching a perfect game against the Minnesota 
Twins on May 17. While he clashed with Steinbrenner and manager Joe 
Torre at times in 1997, he reached a peace with them last year and 
became one of the team's most effective pitchers with an 18-4 
record and a 3.49 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some shock in that room right now,'' Torre said of his  
clubhouse. ``It's something you have to get used to. That is what 
the game is all about. There are going to be changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going into today, New York had retained 24 of the 25 players who  
helped win its second Series title in three seasons, letting go 
only of outfielder Tim Raines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm shocked,'' Lloyd said. ``To break up the team -- it's a  
shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Mark Wohlers and Stan Belinda arrived at spring  
training eager to put aside the memories of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Supervised workouts began today -- 45 days before the Rockies and  
San Diego Padres start the season April 4 at Monterrey, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, that seems a long way off for Wohlers, who reported  
to Atlanta Braves camp in Kissimmee, Fla., on Wednesday in search 
of the strike zone and a way to revive his once promising career. 
</P>
<P>
	It was less than a year ago that Wohlers, who had 97 saves from  
1995-97, inexplicably lost the ability to throw strikes. He had a 
10.18 ERA in Atlanta, with 33 walks and seven wild pitches in 20 
1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	He tried to regain his form in the minor leagues, but that only  
made matters worse. At Triple-A Richmond, he was 0-3 with a 20.43 
ERA, walking 36 and throwing 17 wild pitches in 12 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	During the offseason, Wohlers traveled to Puerto Rico and  
California to work one-on-one with Guy Hansen, a special instructor 
for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I want to do is just get in the program and go along with  
everybody else,'' he said. ``No special treatment, no early 
workouts. People know what I've gone through in the past. I've been 
working hard; there's been some upside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here, that's positive,'' Wohlers said. ``I went through  
some (bad things) last year, and I'm still here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Sarasota, Fla., Belinda talked about a more personal goal:  
his fight against multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has put everything in perspective,'' said Belinda,  
diagnosed with the disease last August. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came here, it gave me a boost or a jolt that I did come  
back and that I am going to make a go of it,'' the Cincinnati 
right-hander said. ``If I give up a dinger to lose a game, it's not 
the end of the world like it was before. It's not what life is all 
about anymore. It's giving your all and being good to people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati was the first team to open camp Tuesday, and six more  
teams started Wednesday, including the NL champion San Diego 
Padres, who saw country star Garth Brooks report to camp at Peoria, 
Ariz. Brooks, a non-roster player, has no shot at making the major 
league team, but could be assigned to the minors if he shows 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last five months, there's been a lot of hard work,'' said  
Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone, who spent millions of Rupert 
Murdoch's dollars to retool the team. ``Right now, the light at the 
end of the tunnel is growing larger and larger. We'll soon be 
involved in actual baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibition games begin March 2, when the New York Mets play St.  
John's University at Port St. Lucie, Fla. Until then, teams will be 
working out and playing intrasquad games. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Pardon Former Slave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will grant a posthumous  
pardon Friday to Henry O. Flipper, the first black West Point 
graduate, whose reputation was tarnished by apparently racially 
motivated charges and a dishonorable discharge from the Army in 
1882. 
</P>
<P>
	The pardon, the result of a long campaign to clear Flipper's  
name, comes 59 years after Flipper's death at the age of 84 in 
Atlanta. His perseverance in the face of injustice already has 
earned Flipper an honored place in Army history. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Colin Powell, who kept a photo of Flipper on his wall while  
serving as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is expected to 
attend Friday's ceremony, along with 17 of Flipper's descendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Born a slave in Thomasville, Ga., Flipper entered West Point in  
1873 when he was 17. Ostracized by white cadets, he maintained his 
dignity and dedicated himself to hard work, graduating 50th in a 
class of 76. The first black commissioned officer in the regular 
U.S. Army, Flipper was assigned to Fort Sill, Okla., to the 10th 
Cavalry, the ``Buffalo Soldiers,'' one of only two all-black units 
in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	After a number of combat assignments on the frontier, Flipper  
was transferred to Fort Davis, Texas. In 1881, his commanding 
officer brought charges accusing Flipper of failing to account 
properly for commissary money entrusted to his care. 
</P>
<P>
	A general court-martial acquitted Flipper of embezzlement but  
convicted him of conduct unbecoming an officer. Reviewing the 
record, the judge advocate general of the Army concluded that 
Flipper had been singled out because of his race and that his 
conduct was excusable, given his isolated position as the only 
former slave and only black officer in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	The final decision rested with President Chester A. Arthur; he  
refused the recommendation for leniency and confirmed the 
conviction. The mandatory penalty was a dishonorable discharge. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Flipper went on to a distinguished career as a surveyor  
and mining engineer. He served seven years as a special agent for 
the Justice Department, joined the staff of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee as an expert on political developments in 
Mexico and was special assistant to the secretary of the Interior 
Department, determining where railroad lines should be built in the 
Alaska Territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had he stayed in the Army, he would have just been a footnote  
in history,'' said Tom Hill, curator of the Thomasville Historical 
Society's museum. ``He probably would have stayed a very 
low-ranking officer until the day he died. As it was, he used his 
education and cut a swath through history that few people have ever 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout his life, Flipper maintained his innocence. But he  
died disappointed that he had been unable to clear his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Long after Flipper's death, the Army Board for Correction of  
Military Records concluded in 1976 that he should not have been 
dismissed from the Army, and issued an honorable discharge in his 
name to his descendants. However, the board held that it was 
without power to set aside President Arthur's decision to confirm 
the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is granting this pardon to correct a past  
wrong,'' a White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flipper has received many posthumous awards. West Point presents  
the Henry Flipper Award annually to the cadet who demonstrates 
leadership, self-discipline and perseverance in light of unusual 
difficulties. A portion of West Point's library was dedicated in 
his honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Flipper's remains were reburied with full military honors in his  
birthplace, Thomasville. And his memory is honored in his hometown, 
where the U.S. Post Office was recently named for him.

<HEADLINE> Designers Offer Star-Worthy Gowns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	 *NEW YORK (AP) -- As Fashion Week heads towards Friday's home  
stretch, Halston designer Kevan Hall previewed winning gowns that 
his celebrity clientele just might slip into for next month's 
Oscars and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	The fall show Thursday, at Halston's garment district showroom,  
zeroed in on just the sort of star-studded eveningwear worthy of an 
Academy Award TV audience of about 1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gowns slit high on the leg or low on the bodice, backless or  
strapless, beaded or sheer, took their cue from architecture. Hall, 
whose customers include Minnie Driver, Halle Berry and Tracy 
Pollan, fashioned big-night-out gowns embroidered with silver metal 
bullion thread to suggest architectural beams, and with rectangular 
cutouts that resemble windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``(New Year's Eve) will be the last party of the century, so  
it's exciting to think about wearing these clothes for those 
special events,'' says Hall. ``We went all out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise prepping for the Oscars circuit, Marc Bouwer sent out a  
slew of slinky gowns Wednesday evening that might be destined for 
the red carpet. 
</P>
<P>
	Dedicating his show to the cosmos, Bouwer's second-skin,  
stretchy tube-like gowns in ``stormy blue,'' ``radiation red'' or 
``metal-dusted'' were indeed for heavenly bodies. With shapes so 
narrow, the styles will likely keep Hollywood's personal trainers 
heavily booked till the awards night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always about the body,'' says Bouwer, whose clients  
include Sigourney Weaver, Shania Twain, Toni Braxton and Charlize 
Theron. 
</P>
<P>
	Now back to the rest of the population: Thursday brought Dana  
Buchman, a $200 million wholesale company that caters to what the 
fashion industry calls real women. They're the sort who favor 
comfortable, figure-friendly classics with a taste of the trends, 
and the new collection delivers just that. 
</P>
<P>
	With a nod to fall's looks that promise to be popular, the  
lineup includes silver metallic sweater sets, mohair sweaters with 
silk taffeta ball skirts, fake-fur cuffs and collars, and 
unconstructed cashmere jackets -- all quietly stylish. 
</P>
<P>
	Another time, another place. Anna Sui, designer of vivacious  
street fashion, saluted folk music Wednesday with an exuberant line 
of patchworks, peasant blouses and ponchos straight from the hippie 
'60s. 
</P>
<P>
	A black-and-white documentary showed a fresh-faced Bob Dylan and  
Judy Collins, as Sui showed her reinvented trappings of the 
Woodstock generation, from funky smock dresses to bell sleeves and 
skirts dotted with little mirrors. The runway rocked with 
guitar-case-toting models, including young pop musician Rufus 
Wainwright. 
</P>
<P>
	While counterculture designer clothes may qualify as an  
oxymoron, and the styles were likely born decades before her 
models, Sui updated the line with a wink at the season's trends, 
including boiled wool, mohair and polar fleece. The line just might 
appeal to her hip customers, among whom are Cher, Liv Tyler and 
Anne Heche. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to epitomize what I consider avant garde and  
bohemian,'' says Sui, who did her homework by culling flea markets, 
listening to dusty old records and watching a black power 
documentary.

<HEADLINE> Linux May Be Threat to Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Burlington Coat Factory could have chosen new  
Windows-based computers for its 250 discount clothing stores this 
year. Instead, the chain plans to buy 1,300 machines running the 
Linux operating system, an upstart challenger to Microsoft's more 
established Windows NT software program. 
</P>
<P>
	The move underscores the fast-growing popularity of the Linux  
system, a respected version of the Unix operating software widely 
used in powerful business computers that run local networks of 
machines or Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux may sound more like a ``Peanuts'' cartoon character than a  
serious operating system for business computers. But surging demand 
for the inexpensive software may pose an important new threat to 
Microsoft Corp., the dominant computer software maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving Linux an important endorsement on Thursday, International  
Business Machines Corp. announced plans to start selling business 
computers that come pre-loaded with Linux. The rollout comes after 
similar moves by Compaq Computer Corp., Dell Computer Corp., 
Hewlett-Packard Co. and Silicon Graphics Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux comprised about 17 percent of the software shipped for  
running business machines last year, up from 7 percent in 1997, 
says International Data Corp., a high-tech research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Linux has come out of almost nowhere and quickly become the  
darling of certain elements of the programming community,'' said 
Tim Bajarin, president of the Creative Strategies Inc. consulting 
firm, based in Campbell, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it remains to be seen if Linux can break out of its  
status as a niche product and spurs mass demand among customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Users rave about Linux's positive attributes, such as its  
tendency not to crash and its flexibility. Developed in the early 
1990s by a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds, Linux can be 
downloaded for free off the Internet, or bought in commercial 
versions from distributors such as Red Hat Software for as little 
as $50. And unlike Microsoft's software blueprints, Linux's source 
code is shared over the Web, which makes it easy for programmers to 
blend in improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, a small cottage industry of developers around the  
globe has sprung up. But there still are relatively few software 
applications that run on the Linux system, particularly compared to 
Windows-compatible programs. 
</P>
<P>
	While systems administrators and programmers at companies  
increasingly are embracing Linux, many corporate managers are 
heavily committed to Microsoft through growing investments in 
Windows for desktop computers and Windows NT for business machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The momentum for Windows and Windows NT is extremely strong,''  
Bajarin said. ``Microsoft is not going to give up any territory 
without a major competitive fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, demand for Linux is growing.  
</P>
<P>
	At Bristol Hotels &AMP; Resorts, a Dallas-based chain of 120 hotels,  
developers use about half-a-dozen Linux computers to design 
Internet software that will perform such tasks as letting hotel 
guests make reservations online. The company hopes to vastly 
increase its use of Linux as the Internet becomes more important to 
its business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very, very hopeful that the user community in the world  
will recognize this as an alternative and choose to embrace it,'' 
said Joshua Norrid, director of application development at Bristol, 
which uses about 4,000 computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Microsoft faces strong competition has become an  
important issue in its unfolding antitrust trial in Washington, 
which accuses Microsoft of unfairly squelching rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, through a spokesman, was quick to reiterate its  
contention that rivals to its business are alive and well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, it's a competitive threat,'' Microsoft spokesman  
Adam Sohn said of Linux. ``We are happy to compete head-to-head 
with Linux on the merits of the technology and the business 
model.''

<HEADLINE> Newark Airport Has Worst Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The airports in Newark, N.J., and San  
Francisco ranked first and second last year in flight delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Newark International Airport had 31,924 delayed flights, or  
about 6.9 percent of its total traffic for 1998, according to 
Federal Aviation Administration data released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving up to second place was San Francisco International, which  
had 29,409 delays, or 6.8 percent of its total. The airport ranked 
third in 1997. Rounding out the top five last year were O'Hare 
International in Chicago, Hartsfield International in Atlanta and 
LaGuardia Airport in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Newark officials complained that they are paying the price for  
antiquated air traffic routing patterns that give preference to 
nearby LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and local officials are working on a plan to redesign  
the traffic patterns to better accommodate the traffic at Newark, 
where flights have doubled in the past 20 years. In 1998, the 
airport had 32.3 million passengers, surpassing the 31.6 million 
who flew in and out of Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working with the FAA so that when they do the air space  
redesign, we're the first in line,'' said Terry Benczik, a 
spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, 
which operates the Newark airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport officials are also lengthening a runway, building more  
gates, adding computerized instrument landing equipment and trying 
to persuade airlines to adjust their scheduling to reduce delays. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA labels a flight as late when it is delayed 15 minutes or  
more from its scheduled arrival or departure time. Newark ranked 
worst for the third consecutive year. It has held that distinction 
since 1991 except for a drop to seventh place in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Hare had a total of 28,751 flight delays, 3.2 percent of its  
total traffic. Hartsfield had 27,764 delays, according to the FAA 
data, also about 3.2 percent of its total traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	LaGuardia, while ranked fifth in the total number of delays, was  
similar to Newark and San Francisco in its percentage of delayed 
flights. It had 24,689 delays in 1998, about 6.8 percent of its 
total traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the top 10 were Logan International Airport in Boston,  
Lambert Airport in St. Louis, Kennedy in New York, Sky Harbor 
Airport in Phoenix and Philadelphia International. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan had 16,400 delays, or 3 percent; Lambert had 15,925  
delays, or 3.16 percent; Kennedy had 12,962 delays, or 3.6 percent; 
Sky Harbor had 11,757 delays, or 2.2 percent; and Philadelphia had 
11,552 delays, or 2.4 percent.

	Prices Jump at Wholesale Level  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Big cost increases for gasoline, pork and  
citrus fruit in January added up to the largest rise in prices 
charged by factories, refineries and food processing plants in more 
than two years. The Labor Department's Producer Price Index began 
the year by jumping 0.5 percent, the most since October 1996, after 
declining 0.1 percent for all of 1998 and 1.2 percent in 1997. 
Prices excluding the volatile food and energy components actually 
fell for the first time in seven months, edging 0.1 percent lower. 

</P>
<P>
	Jobless Claims Rise by 4,000  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New claims for unemployment insurance rose by  
4,000 last week to 288,000. The four-week moving average of claims, 
which smoothes weekly fluctuations in the volatile data series, 
fell from 298,750 to 292,000, the lowest in 10 years.

<P>
	Microsoft Exec: Apple Not Targeted  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Microsoft executive denied charges that the  
software giant tried to sabotage multimedia products made by Apple 
Computer after the company refused to go along with Microsoft's 
plan to ``carve up the market.'' Eric Engstrom, who ran Microsoft's 
audio and video software, said in written testimony released today 
that Microsoft never urged Apple to ``knife the baby'' and stop 
selling QuickTime. QuickTime, a popular software product, lets 
people hear audio and watch video across the Internet and competes 
directly with Microsoft's Netshow and Media player. The claims of 
sabotage were made by Avadis Tevanian, a senior Apple executive who 
testified earlier in the trial of the government's antitrust case 
against Microsoft.

	Aegon Is Buying Transamerica  
</P>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Dutch insurer Aegon NV is buying  
the U.S. life insurance company Transamerica Corp. for $9.7 billion 
in cash and stock. Aegon said the deal announced today would make 
it the third largest U.S. life insurer. The corporate and insurance 
operations of San Francisco-based Transamerica will merge with 
Aegon's businesses in the United States when the deal is completed 
this summer, the Dutch company announced. The Transamerica deal 
will make Aegon the third largest life insurer in the United States 
in terms of assets and premium written, the company said.

	Employers, IG Metall Reach Agreement  
</P>
<P>
	BOEBLINGEN, Germany (AP) -- Employers and metalworkers reached a  
last-minute agreement early today on a new contract, averting a 
strike by Germany's biggest union. IG Metall, whose 3.4 million 
membership includes workers at DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen, had 
threatened to call a strike vote if it did not have a new contract 
by midnight yesterday. A compromise was reached two hours after 
that deadline with help from an independent mediator, a veteran of 
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's party of Social Democrats, brought 
in this week.

	S&AMP;P Downgrades Japan Life Insurers  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Standard and Poor's, a U.S. credit rating agency,  
lowered its ratings on four major Japanese life insurers today, 
saying the companies had been hurt by market and economic 
turbulence in Japan. S&AMP;P said the financial strength and 
creditworthiness of loan portfolios at Asahi Mutual Life Insurance 
Co., Mitsui Life Insurance Co., Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. and 
Yasuda Mutual Life had weakened. The agency added that the four 
companies' exposure to Japan's ailing banking sector and volatile 
real estate and equity markets was high.

	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets -- including Tokyo and  
Singapore -- ended mostly lower in subdued trading today on the back

Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 11.88 points, or 0.08 
percent, to close at 14,146.79. Singapore's Straits Times Index

mixed, with the Nasdaq composite down 2.28 at 2,246.63. Yesterday, 
the Dow dropped 101.56, losing 95 points in the final hour, in a 
fierce sell-off led by technology shares. 

</P>

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tech stocks led early decliners on Wall Street  
today, as they have since late last week. On the New York Stock 
Exchange, Compaq was down 9/16 at 40 7/16. Dell Computer, whose 
earnings release late Tuesday has been dragging the market down 
since last Friday, was unchanged at 81 9/16 in leading Nasdaq 
volume, but it was followed by Cisco Systems, down 2 at 93 1/8, and

<HEADLINE> Lint, Rope Caused Cruise Ship Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Nearly seven months after a fire aboard the cruise  
ship Ecstasy, investigators have pinpointed the fuel that kept the 
blaze roaring for hours: highly flammable mooring rope and laundry 
lint. 
</P>
<P>
	``That explains why you have a very intense fire on the mooring  
deck and why it took so long to extinguish,'' said Merritt Birky, a 
fire expert with the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Plumes of smoke shot out the back of the 855-foot ship shortly  
after it left the Port of Miami for a four-day trip to Key West and 
Cozumel, Mexico, on July 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters took several hours to put out the blaze as the ship  
sat five miles offshore. Fifty-four of the nearly 3,500 people 
aboard were treated for injuries, mostly for smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
	The board presented its findings Wednesday during a hearing on  
the fire that caused $15 million in damage. The board will release 
a final report this year along with safety recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators determined the cause of the fire was a spark from  
a welder's torch being used to repair an ironing board machine in 
the ship's laundry room. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire ignited lint in the machine, causing flames to shoot up  
through air ducts lined with lint and letting out onto to the 
mooring deck, where 7,200 pounds of polypropylene rope was stored. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnival Cruise Lines President Bob Dickinson said he hopes the  
final report will spur the industry to improve safety.

<HEADLINE> Nevada's Sen. Bryan Won't Run Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Sen. Richard Bryan, one of Nevada's top  
politicians, stunned followers today by saying he would not seek a 
third term next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's junior senator said he wanted to enjoy life out of  
the limelight and would not be a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to come home,'' the 61-year-old Democrat said.  
</P>
<P>
	He's the second Democratic senator in two days to announce his  
departure. On Wednesday, it was 75-year-old Sen. Frank Lautenberg 
of New Jersey, who told voters he wouldn't be running for a fourth 
term next year, citing the ``searing reality'' of fund-raising. 
Another Democratic senator, 71-year-old Daniel Patrick Moynihan of 
New York, announced in November that he wouldn't be a candidate in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	With 19 GOP seats and 14 Democratic seats up for re-election  
next year, the departures create opportunities for the Republicans, 
who already have a 55-45 advantage in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan appeared at a hastily called news conference at the school  
where he first got a taste of political life as sophomore class 
president in 1952. He said he was closing out a political career 
that included stints as Nevada's governor and attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where it all began and where it will end,'' Bryan  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've reached the time in my life that I want to be able to  
experience different challenges and opportunities,'' he said. ``I 
close a career in public service with no regrets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A number of politicians attended the news conference, including  
Bryan's fellow Democratic senator, Harry Reid, who said Bryan 
called him early this morning with his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for the state of Nevada this is a loss beyond my  
ability to describe,'' Reid said. ``This is like a funeral to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several in the crowd at a Las Vegas school cried as Bryan made  
his way through on his way to read his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan gave no hint of his plans during a speech to the Nevada  
Legislature on Tuesday, instead talking about major issues faced by 
Congress and President Clinton's impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan was appointed as Nevada's first public defender in 1966  
and elected to the state Assembly two years later. He was elected 
to the state Senate in 1972, elected state attorney general in 1978 
and governor in 1982. He won the first of two Senate terms in 1988.

<HEADLINE> 3 Greek Cabinet Ministers Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Greece's foreign minister and two other  
Cabinet members resigned today amid the political fallout following 
the failure to protect Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign minister, Theodoros Pangalos, and Interior Minister  
Alekos Papadopoulos and Public Order Minister Philipos Petsalnikos 
stepped down following a request by Premier Costas Simitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's capture by regional rival Turkey was an enormous  
humiliation for the country -- even overshadowing the occupation of 
more than a dozen Greek diplomatic missions around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek embassies around the world were besieged by Ocalan's  
supporters on Monday and several diplomats and others were taken 
hostage. By today, only the Greek Embassy in London remained 
occupied by Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unlikely that the political crisis will be strong enough to  
topple the government, which has 163 seats in the 300-member 
parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	But Simitis, facing his most serious political debacle since  
taking power in 1996, took quick action to avoid any festering 
problems that could derail Greece from its main objective: entry in 
the European Union's single currency group by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Pangalos was in charge of the attempt to hide Ocalan at the  
Greek ambassador's residence in Nairobi, Kenya, and find him 
political asylum. Ocalan was captured by Turkish commandos on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Papadopoulos was in charge of Greece's intelligence services,  
which were deeply involved in drawing up the Ocalan operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Petsalnikos, whose ministry is in charge of security forces,  
failed to prevent a small group of Kurdish sympathizers from 
smuggling Ocalan into Greece last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The action handed Greece an issue that it had long tried to  
avoid: direct involvement in helping Ocalan or his Kurdistan 
Workers Party, or PKK, which has waged a 15-year fight for autonomy 
in southeastern Turkey. The conflict has claimed more than 37,000 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Greek officials have expressed support for Kurdish  
self-determination but cautiously avoided direct aid to the PKK. 
They feared turning an international issue into yet another spat 
between the two rivals and possibly triggering a war. The NATO 
neighbors have gone to the brink of war three times in the past 25 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Greeks identify with Ocalan as a modern-day embodiment of  
the Greeks who fought Ottoman rule in the 19th century. Greece's 
governing Socialist party, which was born as an underground 
movement against the 1967-74 military junta, also has deep empathy 
for anyone claiming to fight oppression. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greek officials were outraged by having been forced to deal  
with Ocalan, whose main supporters in Greece include several 
ultra-nationalist politicians and a retired naval officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This government and party supported the struggle of the Kurds  
and protected Ocalan, but a warped picture has been created,'' said 
Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas. 
</P>
<P>
	Reppas said Simitis would seek a judicial inquiry into those who  
``with their illegal initiatives and actions'' brought Ocalan into 
Greece on Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prime minister asked that responsibility be sought from  
all of those people who ... brought Abdullah Ocalan to Greece,'' 
said Reppas. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey forced Ocalan to leave Syria on Oct. 19. Reports indicate  
he came to Greece. But officials, fearing a conflict with Turkey, 
told him to leave, said PKK spokesman Laser Rosad. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan spent the next two months on the run seeking political  
asylum in Russia, Italy and then back to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	A retired Greek Naval commander and longtime friend of Ocalan,  
Andonis Naxakis, said he then convinced Ocalan to fly from St. 
Petersburg to Greece where he hoped to pressure Greece into 
granting him asylum. But Ocalan was again told to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 2, Ocalan's plane was allowed to land in Greece to  
refuel. Then the government decided to send him to Kenya until a 
safe haven could be negotiated with a third country. 
</P>
<P>
	Pangalos had claimed Greek officials lost track of Ocalan after  
he left the ambassador's residence on Monday for a flight to the 
Netherlands, where they claimed Ocalan intended to seek political 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ocalan supporters and others accuse Greece of bungling the  
affair and allowing Turkish commandos to snatch the rebel leader, 
who faces trial and possible execution in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Athens stock exchange plunged 6 percent before the  
resignations were announced, but appeared to rebound after the 
Cabinet reshuffle. 
</P>
<P>
	Replacements for the Cabinet ministers were not immediately  
announced. But it was possible the foreign ministry post could go 
to George Papandreou, the American-born son of Greece's late 
Socialist patriarch Andreas Papandreou.

<HEADLINE>  Roger Clemens Traded to Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Five-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens  
was traded to the New York Yankees today for David Wells, Graeme 
Lloyd and Homer Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens agreed to the deal, but did not get an extension to his  
contract, which has two years to run and calls for him to be paid 
$16.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little emotional right now,'' Wells said after meeting  
with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner at the team's training 
complex. ``Give me a couple days. It's a little tough right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trade shakes up the World Series champions, coming off a  
record-setting 125-win season, on the day they start training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, a quirky left-hander known as ``Boomer,'' was the toast  
of New York after pitching a perfect game against the Minnesota 
Twins last season, While he clashed with Steinbrenner and manager 
Joe Torre at times in 1997, he reached a peace with them last year 
and became one of the team's most effective pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some shock in that room right now,'' Torre said of his  
clubhouse. ``It's something you have to get used to. That is what 
the game is all about. There are going to be changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going into today, New York had retained 24 of the 25 players who  
helped win its second Series title in three seasons, letting go of 
only outfielder Tim Raines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm shocked,'' Lloyd said. ``To break up the team -- it's a  
shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, coming off consecutive Cy Young awards, will report to  
the Yankees this weekend. He has always been one of Steinbrenner's 
favorite players, and is the only five-time Cy Young winner in 
baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roger Clemens is a non-stop Hall of Famer,'' Torre said. ``The  
last two years, what he's done, it's incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Rocket'' exercised a clause in a side agreement between  
himself and the Blue Jays, demanded a trade Nov. 27, wanting to be 
dealt either to a contender or closer to his home in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who has never played on a World Series champion,  
withdrew the demand Dec. 22, criticizing Houston Astros general 
manager Gerry Hunsicker for blasting his request for a $27.4 
million, one-year contract extension, which would have left the 
Astros owing him $43.5 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas, Cleveland and Houston also expressed interest in the  
36-year-old right-hander, who went 20-6 last season, leading the 
American League in ERA (2.65) and strikeouts (271), and tying for 
the lead in wins. His career record is 233-124 in 15 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto had sought several young prospects from teams when it  
shopped Clemens during December's winter meetings in Nashville, 
Tenn., but the Yankees were able to hold onto some of the players 
the Blue Jays coveted most: outfielder Ricky Ledee and pitcher 
Ramiro Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Blue Jays finally lowered their demands, and  
the Yankees couldn't say no. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had an offer yesterday from them to us that made my knees  
buckle,'' New York general manager Brian Cashman said. ``It's tough 
when you have a player the caliber of Roger Clemens staring you in 
the face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the final decision was difficult. New York set an AL  
record for wins last year, going 114-48 in the regular season. The 
Yankees then went 11-2 in the postseason, including a Series sweep 
of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an easy choice to tinker with the success we had in  
1998,'' Cashman said, adding, ``We're a proactive organization and 
constantly looking to improve things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, a 35-year-old left-hander known as much for his fondness  
for heavy metal as his pitching, returns to his first major league 
team. He was with the Blue Jays from 1987-92 before moving on to 
Detroit, Cincinnati, Baltimore and the Yankees. He has a 124-84 
career record and a 3.96 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd, a 31-year-old left-hander from Australia, was 3-0 with a  
1.67 ERA in 50 relief appearances last year, combining with Mike 
Stanton, Jeff Nelson and Ramiro Mendoza to form perhaps the best 
middle relief corps in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, a 26-year-old infielder who plays primarily at second  
base, was voted the top Yankees rookie in spring training last 
year. He hit .380 in 71 at-bats for the Yankees but was considered 
expendable because New York has Chuck Knoblauch.

<HEADLINE> Ripken Adjusts To Life After Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- For the first time in 16 years, Cal Ripken is  
preparing for a season in which he can expect an occasional day 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken's decision last September to end his record string of  
consecutive games at 2,632 will have a direct bearing on his 
playing time in 1999. He's still the Baltimore Orioles' everyday 
third baseman, but this season Ripken almost certainly won't play 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a concept that will take some getting used to.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is all uncharted territory,'' Ripken said. ``Who knows?  
Maybe I'll play in 162 games, maybe 150. It all depends on how the 
season goes. I'm still going to come to the ballpark thinking, `I'm 
available, so use me.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Ray Miller will take Ripken up on the offer. But for the  
first time since 1982, Ripken will be omitted from the starting 
lineup some nights. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he hits .320, he won't get any days off, but I think a few  
days of rest here and there will make Cal about 10 to 15 percent 
better,'' Miller said. ``Without the pressure of the streak to 
worry about, common sense takes over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, 38, ended the streak Sept. 20 by walking into Miller's  
office before the team's final home game and uttering two words: 
``It's time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hadn't missed a game since May 30, 1982, his rookie season --  
an inspirational record of stamina and reliability, particularly 
after the 1994 players' strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The Streak survived eight managers, several injuries and ongoing  
criticism from those who accused Ripken of putting himself ahead of 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel relieved it's over for only one reason,'' Miller said.  
``Every time we lost four in a row, there would be articles saying 
Cal should take a day off. It was so unfair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the main reason why Ripken ended the streak. Five months  
later, he has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing was right. It affected what the focus should be --  
not on me, but on the team,'' Ripken said in an interview. ``I've 
thought about it over the past few months and there wasn't a 
feeling of relief, euphoria or sadness. That proves to me that I 
don't consider the streak that important and that I just want to 
play baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the explanation Ripken gave hundreds of fans who walked  
up to him this winter with one question: Why? 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, the reaction has been all positive,'' he said. ``A  
few people said, `It killed me. Why didn't you keep it going?' But 
the end of the streak is not being treated as a sad thing. They're 
not mourning it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just because Ripken played in 161 games last year instead of  
162, doesn't mean he plans to ask for a day off once the season 
begins April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I feel any less pressure to perform and play every day? No.  
My workouts have been the same, everything has been the same,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Ripken spent much of the offseason working out kinks  
in his aching lower back. Despite a slow start, he hit .308 over 
the final 59 games and finished at .271 with 14 homers and 61 RBIs. 
He also hit a two-run double in his major league record 15th 
straight All-Star start. 
</P>
<P>
	This winter, Ripken broke his nose playing basketball -- the same  
injury he sustained during a team picture at the 1996 All-Star game 
in Philadelphia. He also spent time in Honolulu and Arizona helping 
out with baseball camps and tending to his ailing father, Cal Sr., 
diagnosed with lung cancer in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been difficult. I always look for a silver lining, but  
this one was tough to find,'' Ripken said. ``I guess we all kind of 
banded together as a family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the baseball camps, Ripken and his brother Bill, a former  
Oriole, passed along tips they got from their father, who once 
coached and managed the Orioles. Although Cal Jr. may have a future 
as a baseball coach, for now he's focused on playing well -- and 
often -- in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like when I first came into the big leagues,'' Ripken  
said. ``You have to prove yourself, to show you're worthy of being 
picked by your manager to play every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, almost every day.

<HEADLINE> Prices Jump at Wholesale Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flukey price increases in January for gasoline  
at refineries, pork at meatpacking plants and oranges at 
fruit-growers temporarily pushed up wholesale costs at the fastest 
rate in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices paid by wholesalers to producers jumped 0.5 percent, the  
most since October 1996, the Labor Department said Thursday. But 
economists saw it as a one-time event and said little of it will 
get passed on to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a quirk in January,'' said economist Robert Dederick of  
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``It's a one-month wonder. ... 
Fundamentally, there really isn't any inflation out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As if to prove the point, stock and bond markets barely blinked.  
A truly scary price report would have roiled Wall Street with fear 
that the inflation-wary Federal Reserve was about to raise interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing here for the Fed to get excited about,'' said  
economist Ken Mayland of KeyCorp in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Producer prices also increased substantially in December, by 0.4  
percent, but that was entirely due to a 26.3 percent surge in 
tobacco prices following the multimillion-dollar liability 
settlements between tobacco companies and state attorneys general. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of last year, producer prices edged 0.1 percent lower on  
top of a 1.2 percent drop in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, prices excluding the volatile food and energy  
components actually fell for the first time in seven months, 
sliding 0.1 percent lower. And analysts believe inflation in prices 
paid by consumers will accelerate only modestly this year, about 
2.5 percent, compared with a 12-year low of 1.6 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the department said first-time applications for  
unemployment checks barely budged last week, staying at a level 
signaling healthy demand for labor. 
</P>
<P>
	State unemployment offices received a seasonally adjusted  
288,000 claims for benefits, up from 284,000 the week before. A 
four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes weekly 
fluctuations in the volatile series, fell from 298,750 to 292,000, 
the lowest in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rash of corporate layoffs announced at yearend have had no  
impact, at least to date,'' said economist Mark Zandi of Regional 
Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``Any layoffs that are 
occurring are being offset by aggressive hiring elsewhere. There's 
a reasonable prospect the unemployment rate will continue to 
fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In January, prices charged by food producers rose 1.6 percent,  
the most in nearly six years, after slipping 0.1 percent during 
1998. Energy prices jumped 1.8 percent, the most in two years, but 
they fell 12.1 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the price of pork shot up 18.3 percent, the largest  
one-month increase in nearly 25 years, after falling 26.9 percent 
over the course of the previous year in response to diminished 
demand in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University  
attributed the rise to winter storms -- which resulted in farmers 
sending fewer animals to slaughter -- and to an inevitable rebound 
from 1998's sharp drop. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was getting to the point that it was going to cost more to  
fuel the truck that brings the pig in than you would get for the 
pig,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh fruits and melons cost 19.6 percent more than the month  
before, the largest increase in 13 months, reflecting a 56.3 
percent rise in citrus fruit prices and 26.7 percent in 
strawberries following a freeze in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices climbed 6.5 percent, the most in 17 months,  
after plunging 34.1 percent last year. Fuel oil increased 6.4 
percent. But so far this month, petroleum prices have fallen and, 
Ratajczak said, gasoline prices should follow. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside food and energy, car prices fell 1.2 percent last month,  
the most in a year and a half, and computer costs declined 4.5 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Public Lukewarm to Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite strong support among loyal Republicans  
for a tax cut, pivotal ticket-splitting voters are ``closer to 
Democrats'' when it comes to proposals for allocating the federal 
budget surplus, according to a confidential survey taken for the 
Senate GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``On paying down the debt they are closer to us than to the  
Democrats,'' says the survey, which was taken last November and 
distributed to GOP senators just as President Clinton's impeachment 
trial was getting under way. ``To expand beyond the base of 
Republican tax cutters, we need to stress debt reduction and Social 
Security,'' it concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was taken by Voter Consumer Research, a Bethesda,  
Md., polling company, to help Senate Republicans chart a 
legislative course for this year that would ``put Democrats on the 
defensive.'' Another purpose was to generate appeal among 
ticket-splitters who are likely to play a pivotal role in the 2000 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP survey was taken in the wake of elections that were  
disappointing for Republicans -- a loss of seats in the House and no 
net change in the Senate. The survey, along with an accompanying 
memo by Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, chairman of the GOP 
Senate campaign committee, was distributed about a month ago, as 
lawmakers struggled with Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the Republican leadership seems to be taking heed from  
the survey data. While voter concern about defense issues does not 
rank high, there is strong support for improving the pay of 
personnel. Thus, legislation to grant a pay increase for the armed 
forces is expected to be on the Senate floor as soon as lawmakers 
return from their current recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the cautionary note about tax cuts, the survey says it  
is ``one of the very few issues that is still truly our issue'' and 
must be a key part of any agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi traveled to Michigan  
late last week to stress support for a tax cut, and Rep. John 
Kasich of Ohio, a presidential hopeful, favors a 10 percent 
across-the-board reduction in income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Clinton favors targeted tax cuts that would be less  
costly, and emphasizes the need to shore up Social Security. ``Will 
our first priority be spending the budget surplus that we have 
worked so hard to create on a terrifically appealing tax cut in the 
moment, or will our first priority be investing whatever the 
necessary amount of the surplus is for at least the next 15 years 
to strengthen Social Security and Medicare,'' he said Wednesday in 
comments beamed nationwide to students. 
</P>
<P>
	In his memo, McConnell wrote that Social Security, tax cuts and  
education should be the three issues to focus on for the coming 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	On taxes, he wrote, ``Here is our dilemma in a nutshell: a  
plurality of Republican voters rated tax cuts as the highest 
priority for dividing up the surplus, but among ticket-splitters, 
tax cuts were the least popular choice.'' Preserving Social 
Security ranked the highest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell said Republicans must push for tax cuts for several  
reasons, saying it is the only issue that holds the Republican 
electoral base together. ``Sad to say, it is just about the only 
issue that people uniformly cite as a reason to vote Republican,'' 
McConnell wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said, ``We should be under no illusion that  
there is steadfast support for tax cuts outside of our base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When all voters in the survey were asked about allocating the  
surplus, 27 percent said spend more on education, health care and 
the environment, 26 percent said shore up Social Security, 23 
percent said enact cut taxes, and 20 percent said pay down the 
national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also offered a few postscripts on the last election  
that were discouraging for Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the issues on which Americans look to Republicans for  
leadership -- taxes, defense and the budget -- are in the bottom half 
of the list of priority issues. In addition, moral issues, which 
Republicans had counted on to help them at the polls, ``played a 
relatively minor role'' when voters made their decisions at the 
ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
	House elections rated only a footnote in the Senate survey.  
</P>
<P>
	But it said the costly television advertising campaign that  
touched on impeachment had backfired. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did not motivate the Republican base voter, who was already  
motivated,'' the survey said. ``It did anger Democrats and 
motivated them more.''

<HEADLINE> Fiat To Acquire Majority of Renault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TURIN, Italy (AP) -- Fiat SpA subsidiary Comau SpA will acquire  
51 percent of Renault SA's fully owned Renault Automation, the two 
companies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiat will have an option to buy the remaining 49 percent between  
2002 and 2004, but other financial details won't be released until 
the two groups sign a final agreement, expected in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Comau, which is 65 percent-owned by Fiat, had 1998 revenues of  
$928.5 million, while automobile assembly company Renault 
Automation had sales of around $115 million. The Renault unit 
derived 85 percent of its sales from business with its parent 
company or with PSA Peugeot Citroen, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement is the third in recent months between the two car  
and truck makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The two pooled their bus-making operations into a 50/50 joint  
venture, renamed Iris.bus, which became operative Jan. 1 after an 
accord in May. It expects sales of $1.25 billion in 1999, and a 27 
percent share of the European bus market. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Fiat and Renault agreed to pool their foundry  
operations, with Fiat owning 66.5 percent of a company which will 
have 1999 sales around $1.87 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Such deals have helped fuel speculation, regularly denied by  
both companies, that they could seek a full-fledged merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the two could cooperate more on truck and other  
specific operations, but that there is too large an overlap in 
their car model ranges for a merger to be very feasible, 
particularly since both operate in labor markets where layoffs are 
difficult to undertake.

<HEADLINE> Charlotte Event To Lose Sponsor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- The Indy Racing League's top promoter is  
preparing to lose the title sponsor of the event held at its track 
in suburban Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Speedway Motorsports Inc. is making plans to compensate for the  
expected loss of VisionAire Corp. as the top sponsor of the May 1 
race at Lowe's Motor Speedway, sources told The Associated Press on 
Thursday on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd hate to see them pull out, but I'm not worried about it  
from the standpoint of being able to race. We can make up for it,'' 
said SMI president H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler, whose company owns the 
tracks on which five of this year's 11 IRL races will be run. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler said SMI had not been officially notified that  
VisionAire is withdrawing its sponsorship but was ready to seek new 
backers if the contract is terminated. 
</P>
<P>
	VisionAire is entering the final year of a three-year contract  
to be the title sponsor of a 500-kilometer race at Lowe's, a deal 
worth about $500,000 annually. But sources told the AP that IRL and 
SMI officials have begun to refer to the 1999 event as the 
Charlotte 500 and not the VisionAire 500 because they don't expect 
the company to back this year's race. 
</P>
<P>
	When a two-day tire test for IRL cars ended at the speedway  
Thursday night, the track issued a news release on the session in 
which the upcoming race was repeatedly referred to as the Charlotte 
500. VisionAire was not mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an approach is premature, according to VisionAire, a  
Chesterfield, Mo.-based manufacturer of what it calls entry-level 
corporate jet airplanes. Company spokesman Steve Goodhue said there 
have been discussions recently about the status of the sponsorship 
but no decision has been made to withdraw it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still from our perspective the title sponsor of the  
VisionAire 500,'' Goodhue said Thursday night. ``It has been a 
tremendous venue for us the last couple years and we certainly have 
recognized some benefits from it. It is our intention to continue 
to be the title sponsor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Losing VisionAire could mean six of this year's 11 IRL events  
would be run without title sponsors. Four of those races are at SMI 
tracks, including events at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Texas Motor 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wheeler said individual race sponsorship is not his primary  
concern for the fledgling circuit, which last year acquired the Pep 
Boys auto parts chain as its title sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler said the addition of Pep Boys and other sponsors to the  
IRL, as well as improvements in cars, safety and the size of race 
fields, have boosted his image of a circuit that has struggled to 
attract fans. The inaugural VisionAire 500 drew a 
larger-than-expected crowd of more than 73,000 in 1997, but 
attendance slipped to about 50,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you've got a startup deal, you're going to have little  
things that will happen and big things that will happen. You've 
just got to look over all of it and put your head down and keep 
going and look at the long-term picture,'' he said. ``And I'm 
extremely optimistic this year -- much more so than I was last year 
-- about the whole Indy Racing League.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Shifting Focus of Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is shifting the focus of its  
antitrust trial to a deal it allegedly tried to strike with rival 
Netscape to illegally divide the Internet software market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department claims the offer took place during a June  
21, 1995, meeting. Earlier in the trial, government attorneys 
called upon a witness who portrayed the gathering as an attempt by 
Microsoft to smother its competition. Now, Microsoft gets the 
chance to call its own witness to rebut the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Rosen, the company's general manager for new technology,  
said Microsoft never offered Netscape Communications Corp. a chance 
to split the emerging Web browser market during that June 1995 
meeting which he attended and helped set up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those charges are absurd and untrue,'' Rosen said in written  
testimony released Wednesday. Like all witnesses in the case, his 
direct testimony was submitted to the court in writing to help 
shorten the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen is expected to take the witness stand after attorneys  
finish questioning John Rose, a senior executive for Compaq 
Computers Corp., who is testifying for Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose testified Wednesday that Compaq will continue buying the  
Windows operating system because its the only viable option for its 
consumers. More than 90 percent of Compaq computers come equipped 
with Windows, mainly because there are 70,000 application programs 
that can run on the system, Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose also was questioned about a price hike for Windows that  
Microsoft made last March. He acknowledged the increase to a 
government attorney but insisted that it wasn't a ``significant'' 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Later today, Microsoft was scheduled to release new written  
testimony from its next witness after Rosen. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Engstrom, who was in charge of the company's audio- and  
video-software, was expected to refute previous testimony that 
Microsoft once urged Apple Computer Inc. to ``knife the baby'' and 
stop selling its popular QuickTime multimedia software, which 
competed directly with Microsoft's own products, called Netshow and 
Media Player. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged proposal outraged Apple's chief executive officer,  
Steve Jobs, who complained about it in a February 1998 e-mail to 
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are really going out of their way to say they intend to  
kill QuickTime, and are being quite threatening and rude about 
it,'' Jobs wrote. ``You don't hear Apple trashing Windows, do you? 
If you did, you might feel the same way we now feel hearing the 
Netshow group trashing QuickTime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Apple executive, Avadis Tevanian, also charged earlier  
in the trial that Microsoft designed parts of its Windows operating 
system to bypass Apple's software and created misleading error 
messages for QuickTime customers. 
</P>
<P>
	But he offered no evidence, and he admitted it's ``not unusual''  
that new software is sometimes incompatible with existing programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft denied it acted with malice. It later blamed the  
problem on Apple's own programming mistakes, and said independent 
laboratories confirmed that Apple caused the errors.

<HEADLINE> Murphy Case Over for K-State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas State felt vindicated Thursday  
after the NCAA praised the university's handling of violations 
involving running back Frank Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA Committee on Infractions accepted penalties that were  
self-imposed. The only additional sanction was an extension by one 
year of a two-year probation that Kansas State was already serving 
for unrelated violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Committee on Infractions commended Kansas State for acting  
quickly once it learned of the violations and noted that no one 
directly associated with the athletic department knew what had 
happened until it was reported by a booster. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did everything right as far as we could see,'' said  
Bonnie Slatton, chairwoman of physical education and sports studies 
at Iowa and acting chairwoman of the Infractions Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy, the top prospect out of junior college last year,  
accepted $200 in cash before enrolling at Kansas State and another 
$3,200 after enrolling to buy a used BMW. 
</P>
<P>
	A booster solicited the $3,200 from nine other boosters in  
amounts ranging from $200 to $700. The violations would have gone 
undetected, Slatton said, unless a booster not involved had not 
contacted university officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The praise from the Infractions Committee was unusual, said Mike  
Glazier, an attorney with an Overland Park firm that represented 
Kansas State. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my experience, it is rare for the committee to so strongly  
commend a university for its handling of an infractions matter and 
to impose no penalty,'' Glazier said. ``From a professional 
standpoint, the committee's report provides clear guidance to those 
who counsel member institutions on how to respond to infractions 
matters ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy had accepted the money thinking it was coming from a  
friend and not knowing that it had been collected from Kansas State 
boosters, the university said in its report to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas State declared Murphy ineligible for four games at the  
start of last season. To regain eligibility, Murphy returned the 
car and made a $3,400 donation to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Athletic Department disassociated itself from the 10  
boosters involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy signed with Kansas State after rushing for 1,370 yards  
and 26 touchdowns, leading Garden City, Kan. Community College to 
the junior college championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	He was expected to provide a high-powered combination with  
quarterback Michael Bishop for the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
	But after sitting out the four games, Murphy never became an  
integral part of the offense. He rushed for 257 yards on 55 carries 
and five touchdowns and caught three passes for 91 yards and a 
touchdown. Murphy also returned eight kickoffs for 210 yards.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Arrives for Clinton Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- French President Jacques Chirac is using a  
two-day visit to the United States to demonstrate there is more 
that unites the two old allies than divides them. 
</P>
<P>
	But differences do exist, on Iraq and currency alignment.  
</P>
<P>
	Chirac arrived today for talks with President Clinton that will  
focus on security issues in Europe and reform of the global 
financial system. He also will see the heads of the International 
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development 
Bank. Chirac is staying at Blair House, across Pennsylvania Avenue 
from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the two leaders would  
discuss Kosovo, NATO's 50th anniversary summit in Washington in 
April, Iraq, Russia and global financial issues. 
</P>
<P>
	After lunch Friday, they are scheduled to hold a joint news  
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac has said France and the United States are on the same  
wavelength on Kosovo. France is hosting talks aimed at bringing 
peace to the war-torn Serbian province and has set Saturday as a 
deadline for the two sides to reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in Paris with The Associated Press before his  
departure, Chirac bristled at the idea the United States and France 
are competitors, even though they differ on some foreign policy 
issues, particularly the recent U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``France is not worried about a powerful United States,'' Chirac  
said. ``In the world today it is a real necessity. France wants to 
be part of a strong Europe and we do as much as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like the idea of presenting Europe and the United  
States as competitors,'' Chirac added. ``We have the same values. 
We are two great democracies. We are partners and we must be great 
partners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Iraq, Chirac emphasized common points with Washington rather  
than differences. ``I wouldn't say that French and American policy 
are so different,'' he said. ``We both agree about the 
responsibility of Saddam Hussein.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he also referred to a French plan he intends to raise with  
Clinton, under which Iraq would agree to allow weapons inspections 
in return for lifting the U.N. embargo on its oil, which Chirac 
argues hurts the Iraqi people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing is that France asks: What shall we do after the  
bombs?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, whose objective is to topple Saddam, is  
skeptical about the French plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac also wants to make progress on reducing world financial  
volatility. ``The world financial system needs to be changed 
because the world has changed. ... I think we should have better 
organization,'' Chirac said. 
</P>
<P>
	France has proposed assigning trading levels, or bands, for  
currencies to reduce volatility among the dollar, Europe's new 
euro, and the Japanese yen, an idea Germany and Japan support. 
Countries would be committed to intervene by buying and selling 
currencies on the open market to maintain those exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Clinton supports those calling for a new global  
``financial architecture'' to prevent future Asian-style currency 
crises, the United States remains opposed to setting target ranges 
for currency values. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Wednesday he believed such  
proposals would probably at some point be at odds with U.S. 
domestic economic interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac also wants to improve market regulation and to involve  
the private sector in the solution of financial crises.

<HEADLINE> GOP Moderates Want Hostility To End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new Republican moderate group says the party  
must soften its language and push a centrist agenda featuring 
``compassion as well as prudence'' or it could lose control of 
Congress in the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Immediately, the rhetoric of partisan hostility must stop,''  
the Republican Main Street Partnership wrote in an open letter to 
congressional Republicans. ``Our language too often has been heard 
as mean, judgmental and partisan. That 'the other side does it' is 
no excuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter concedes, ``Challenges will rise from partisan and  
ideological quarters. That is when we must stay the course with 
unity, courage -- and discipline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter underscores the tug of war under way within the GOP  
in the wake of President Clinton's unpopular impeachment trial and 
party losses in last November's elections. The GOP failed to 
improve its 55-45 Senate edge and lost five House seats, leaving it 
with a precarious 11-seat House margin and big questions about how 
to prepare for the 2000 presidential and congressional races. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership's preference is to push a bipartisan agenda that  
can be enacted into law with Clinton, including action on Social 
Security, schools and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``On health care, Medicaid and Medicare, we must legislate with  
compassion as well as prudence,'' they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership is a year-old group representing moderate  
Republicans in Congress and across the country. Among its listed 
members are 41 House members, three senators, former Secretary of 
State Henry Kissinger and ITT Corp. chairman Rand Araskog. 
</P>
<P>
	The group released its letter even as House GOP leaders tried to  
craft a consensus agenda Republican lawmakers can pursue this year. 
There is general agreement to pursue a Social Security overhaul 
with Clinton and to seek tax cuts, education changes and more 
spending for defense, but the leaders are laboring to line up 
support for specific proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Some GOP aides privately expressed frustration that the moderate  
group was focusing attention on Republican divisions rather than on 
opposition Democrats. But conservative Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., 
a member of the House GOP leadership, said he welcomed the letter's 
call for GOP unity behind positive themes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's focus on showing why our ideas are good for people,''  
McIntosh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The moderates' letter was short on specifics, which is where  
many of the internal GOP disputes occur. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, on taxes it says, ``We must work to reduce the  
burden on hardworking middle-class American families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is a sentiment supported by all Republicans, and many  
Democrats for that matter. But the GOP is divided over whether to 
support a 10 percent cut in income-tax rates, phased-in rate 
reductions, or narrower reductions such as ending the so-called 
marriage penalty under which some married couples owe more taxes 
than they would if single. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be hard work'' to resolve those differences,  
McIntosh said. ``But that's what we're paid to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., one of the group's  
founders, said the partnership was stressing not just centrist 
policies but also enactment of legislation with Clinton. Many 
Republicans believe bipartisan legislation must become law for the 
GOP to demonstrate it can govern and is not obsessed with Clinton's 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really talking about an agenda that will move the  
country forward,'' Houghton said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Warns U.S. on Kosovo Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Boris Yeltsin warned President Clinton not to  
launch airstrikes against Yugoslavia, even if it fails to meet a 
deadline on reaching peace with Kosovo rebels, the Russian leader 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not allow Kosovo to be touched,'' Yeltsin said he told  
Clinton in a recent phone conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I conveyed my opinion by letter and by telephone to Clinton,  
that this (bombing attack) won't do. That's it,'' Yeltsin told 
reporters today before talks with European officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential press service said Yeltsin made the remarks  
during recent talks with Clinton, but did not specify when the 
discussion took place. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton had not had any  
recent discussions with Yeltsin concerning Kosovo and airstrikes. 
Lockhart said the United States has worked closely with the 
Russians on Kosovo, ``but we reserve the right to act in NATO's 
self-interest if that's necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And we will if we don't get the conclusion we need to get at  
the peace talks,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the buildup of air forces in the area, Lockhart  
said, ``The secretary of defense is taking prudent steps to be 
ready if military force is needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin was answering a reporter's question about his reaction  
to the United States' decision Wednesday to send an additional 51 
planes to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States was moving the planes in preparation for  
possible NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia if it does not sign a peace 
agreement with Kosovo rebels and accept NATO peacekeeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks between Yugoslavia and the Kosovo rebels are being  
held in Rambouillet, France, mediated by a six-nation contact group 
that includes the United States, Russia, France, Britain, Germany 
and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The contact group has set a deadline of noon Saturday for  
reaching a peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin did not say how Russia would respond if NATO launched  
airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian leader has issued similar warnings in the past,  
telling the Americans not to bomb Iraq during the periodic 
standoffs over United Nations weapons inspections in the Arab 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Americans have gone ahead with bombing raids on  
several occasions. In December, Russia recalled its ambassadors to 
the United States and Britain when the two nations bombed Iraq, but 
the ambassadors soon returned to their posts.

<HEADLINE> Air Traffic Control Changes Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The people overseeing the nation's air traffic  
control system need to be changed to promote better efficiency for 
airlines and their passengers, the head of Southwest Airlines said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The system, currently run by the Federal Aviation  
Administration, should instead be supervised by a board of 
directors appointed by the president and headed by the leader of 
the FAA, Herbert Kelleher said during a speech to the Wings Club of 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-member board also should hire a chief operating  
officer to oversee air traffic control, and establish means for 
measuring the organizational, financial and operational performance 
of the system, said the chairman of Southwest, a discount airline 
known for its financial innovations. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the board should have the legal authority to obtain  
loans for the longterm modernization of the air traffic control 
system, said Kelleher. 
</P>
<P>
	The speech built off of one given in Washington three weeks ago  
by Donald Carty, chairman of American Airlines. In general terms, 
he called on the nation's major airlines to drop their political 
differences and unite on a plan for air traffic modernization. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Carty and Kelleher complained about the lost profits and  
passenger inconvenience generated by the current system, which 
Carty noted has been labeled ``a vacuum tube relic in a microchip 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both also said the CEOs were determined to work with the FAA on  
resolving the problem. The agency, headed by Administrator Jane 
Garvey, is in the midst of a multibillion dollar upgrade, but it 
has been hit by delays and technological barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our plan calls for comprehensive reform of the way the federal  
government carries out its stewardship of aviation,'' Kelleher 
said. ``Structural reform of the FAA to enable it to handle the 
capacity enhancement and technological modernization we need, and 
budget reform to ensure that the enormous taxes collected from 
airlines and our customers are spent for their intended purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the air traffic proposals, Kelleher said the  
airlines want all money in the federal Airport and Airway Trust 
Fund to be spent on airport and air traffic control improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is generated by ticket and fuel taxes but the Clinton  
administration has been holding onto some of it to offset other 
deficits in the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The account had a surplus of $4.3 billion as of Sept. 30. It is  
projected to have a surplus of $6.8 billion as of Sept. 30, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Defense Secretary Visits Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Leaders in the high-flying information  
technology business have lost sight of the role America's military 
has played in their success, Defense Secretary William Cohen says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some in the 'digital world' dismiss the importance of the  
national security world,'' Cohen told about 200 Microsoft employees 
in a speech on the software giant's suburban Seattle campus 
Thursday. Company Chairman Bill Gates, seated behind Cohen, cracked 
a paper-thin smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some soldiers in the high-tech revolution do not fully  
understand or appreciate the soldiers in camouflage,'' Cohen said, 
``that tanks and guns are somehow rusty relics of the past, nearly 
obsolete in the new information-based world that is going to carry 
us into the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said Microsoft -- whose biggest customer is the Defense  
Department -- has a healthy appreciation of the importance of 
American military power. But he complained about one unidentified 
industry official whose dismissive remark he had read in The New 
York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	He quoted the official as saying, ``Money is extracted from  
Silicon Valley and then wasted by Washington.'' Cohen said this 
attitude revealed a troubling lack of understanding of how the U.S. 
military's presence and influence abroad help the American economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indeed, peace and stability are the very cornerstones of  
prosperity,'' Cohen said. ``When our diplomats and military forces 
work together to help create stability and security in a nation or 
a region, that same stability and security attracts investment. 
Investment, in turn, generates prosperity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Introducing Cohen, Gates enthusiastically welcomed him as  
representing ``our biggest customer in the world.'' The Pentagon, 
whose network of more than 2.1 million computers is central to its 
military missions, buys $300 million a year in Microsoft products. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates said Microsoft is intent on working with the Defense  
Department to improve the security of its information from the 
threat of cyberterrorism. ``It's fair to say this is an unsolved 
problem,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening remarks Cohen noted how unusual it is for a  
defense secretary to visit a company like Microsoft. He said the 
usual itinerary for a visit to the Seattle area would center on a 
tour of Boeing Co., which ranks as the nation's No. 2 defense 
contractor. In fact Cohen did visit Boeing, then flew to 
Microsoft's campus by Army helicopter, an entrance that he said 
jokingly may have surprised and unsettled some workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably thought this is 'Red Dawn,'' referring to the  
1980s movie about a foreign army's invasion of the United States, 
``or an invasion of the aliens,'' Cohen said to laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the second in a series of appearances by Cohen before  
Americans outside the traditional circle of audiences for a 
Pentagon chief. Last month, he spoke to the Illinois General 
Assembly in Springfield, and he is considering speeches this year 
to the Kansas City Board of Trade, at New Orleans' City Hall and to 
the Arkansas Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen told his Microsoft audience that the nation needs to show  
its support for those in uniform and invest more in its high-tech 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must invest in the next generation of weapons and  
technology if we are to maintain our ability to shape and respond 
to world events in the 21st century,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Visits Microsoft Corp. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- By calling for the first sustained increase in  
military spending in 15 years, the Clinton administration is 
arguing that the end of the Cold War has brought not a warm peace 
but new dangers. It worries, however, that fewer Americans see a 
link between military might and their own security. 
</P>
<P>
	With that concern in mind, Defense Secretary William Cohen was  
marshaling his arguments for ensuring American military 
pre-eminence in the 21st century in a speech today to employees of 
Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will point out that the prosperity that companies like  
Microsoft now enjoy could not occur without having the strong 
military that we have,'' Cohen told reporters upon his arrival in 
Seattle this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second in a series of appearances by Cohen before  
Americans outside the traditional circle of audiences for a 
Pentagon chief. Last month, he spoke to the Illinois General 
Assembly in Springfield, and he is considering speeches to the 
Kansas City Board of Trade and at New Orleans City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen's message is this:  
</P>
<P>
	For all the domestic prosperity produced by the Information Age  
-- symbolized by the astounding success of Microsoft -- America's 
economic power is still dependent on its military strength. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep up that strength, the Clinton administration is  
proposing to spend an extra $112 billion on the military over the 
next six years. It would be the first sustained increase since the 
big military buildup of the early 1980s, and some critics have 
questioned whether the added investment is worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
	During his visit to the Illinois statehouse last month, Cohen  
noted that the Chicago Tribune had asked in an editorial whether it 
made sense to keep buying expensive weapons that were developed 
with Cold War missions in mind, such as the Air Force's B-2 stealth 
bomber, which costs $2 billion apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are seeing the beginning of a new world, one we hoped would  
be one of order,'' Cohen said then, ``and we look across the 
landscape and see it is one of more disorder than order. So we have 
a whole landscape of new threats and diverse threats we have to 
face.'' Message: The cost of defense is going up. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense secretary is making the case that conflicts in  
faraway lands such as Bosnia, Korea and Iraq have a direct effect 
on the U.S. economy. The billions it costs to keep 100,000 American 
troops in South Korea and Japan, for example, makes Asia more 
stable -- and thus better markets for U.S. goods. The military's 
success in holding Iraq in check ensures a continued flow of oil 
from the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen chose Microsoft as his forum because of its global  
prominence, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sees this as a chance to reach out to a whole new  
community,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides addressing Microsoft workers, Cohen was meeting  
privately with company chairman Bill Gates and other top 
executives. While in the Seattle area he also was visiting Boeing 
Co. to see the production line for the Air Force's new F-22 stealth 
fighter and get briefings on other Boeing defense projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen is concerned that many people in the information  
technology industries dismiss the importance of the national 
security establishment, view the Pentagon bureaucracy as a dinosaur 
unable to adapt to changing times, and believe computer labs -- not 
weapons labs -- are the engine of innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Krepinevich, head of the Center for Strategic and  
Budgetary Assessments in Washington, says these doubters have a 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Defense Department needs to get out there and see what the  
commercial sector is doing,'' Krepinevich said in an interview. 
``It's not the Cold War anymore.'' The days are gone, he said, when 
the Pentagon could tend to its own gardens of technological growth 
and ignore innovation in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Pentagon is taking a closer look. Under a program  
started by Cohen's predecessor, William Perry, the Defense 
Department arranges for mid-level military officers to spend a year 
in the commercial world to learn the ways of the private sector and 
then apply that knowledge to the military. Microsoft, the world's 
largest software maker, is among the companies that have 
participated in that program. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also was making the case that the military, like Microsoft  
and other computer industry successes, must keep investing in new 
research and development in order to retain its dominant position. 
</P>
<P>
	``That has the potential to backfire on him,'' Krepinevich said.  
``I'm not sure a lot of Americans even realize we spend a quarter 
of a billion dollars a year on defense.''

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Broke Promise to Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Salt Lake City ``robbed'' U.S. winter sports  
athletes of $3 million in unkept promises made in its bid for the 
Winter Olympics, a former ski official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Peterson, who stepped down as executive director of the  
U.S. Skiing Association in 1994, said none of the money pledged 10 
years ago for training time, subsidized housing, work-study 
programs and tuition aid for American athletes had been paid. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for Utah authorities to come through with the money  
now to help get American athletes ready for 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said the support had been promised by Norm Bangerter,  
then Utah's governor; Palmer DePaulis, then mayor of Salt Lake; and 
Tom Welch, chairman of the city's Olympic bid, during the race to 
be the USOC's candidate for the Winter Games in 1998 and 2002 
</P>
<P>
	With Salt Lake's victorious run for the 2002 Winter Olympics now  
at the center of a multimillion-dollar bribery scandal, Peterson 
said, it was time for the city to finally make good on its 
commitment to American skiers, skaters and other athletes training 
for those games. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I see it, the athletes were robbed,'' he said. ``When you  
rob someone, you pay restitution. Utah needs to come clean with the 
athletes. They may have spent the money somewhere, but they didn't 
spend that money on U.S. athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DePaulis, now an assistant to Utah Attorney General, said in a  
telephone interview he had no recollection of the assistance 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, who resigned as Salt Lake Organizing Committee chairman  
in 1997 amid charges of spouse abuse, did not return phone messages 
left at his home. Bangerter is on a Mormon church mission in Africa 
and was not available. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson, who ran the ski federation at the time and was also a  
member of the U.S. Olympic Committee's site selection task force, 
said the USOC's executive committee would be asked this weekend to 
pressure Salt Lake for the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Knapp, an executive committee member who headed the  
site-selection panel in 1989, said she would pass Peterson's 
request to USOC leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Knapp said she was unaware of any pledges bid cities had made  
for training programs, or if promises Salt Lake might have made had 
been fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there was give and take,'' she said. ``What was given  
and taken, I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC and the Salt Lake Organizing Committee said that a  
check of Salt Lake's bid documents for both 1998 and 2002 found no 
specific mention of the program referred to by Peterson. The only 
thing close was a promise that 15 percent of a projected $50 
million surplus would go to ``athlete development and training,'' 
USOC spokesman Mike Moran said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson, however, provided documents from a USOC board meeting  
in Des Moines, Iowa, on June 4, 1989, at which the four bidders 
offered ``sweeteners'' for their packages. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake's concluded:  
</P>
<P>
	``Athletes to receive out-of-state tuition waivers, scholarships  
(elite level), and work/study training programs. National team has 
top priority at venues free of charge. Subsidized housing provided 
at venue sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said the restitution figure was based on athlete  
support pledged by Salt Lake and three other cities -- Reno, Nev.; 
Anchorage, Alaska; and Denver -- that sought the American candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came to roughly $300,000 a year,'' Peterson said. ``They  
haven't paid a penny for 10 years. That's $3 million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The payments, should they be made, would go directly to athlete  
training programs, with the USOC making sure it wound up in the 
right hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would be pure money, no administrative costs or  
overhead,'' he said. ``We don't want it going to people who already 
have money or athletes who would not be valid competitors in 
2002.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson, who lives in Park City, Utah, said he had ``regularly  
brought up'' the payments to the Utah Sports Advisory Committee 
``but it was always met with a shrug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least five investigations are under way into the Salt Lake  
scandal, the worst in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	An ethics panel last week reported that Salt Lake bidders paid  
more that $1.2 million in cash, travel, medical care and gifts to 
24 IOC members to try to win their votes for 2002. Nine of those 
already have resigned or been expelled from the IOC and at least 13 
remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	A USOC ethics panel headed by former Senate Majority Leader  
George Mitchell is looking at the American committee's choice of 
Salt Lake and set to issue its findings March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department, meanwhile, is investigating possible  
mail or wire fraud; false statements or perjury; tax fraud; and 
violations of customs laws that require declaration of sums of 
$10,000 or more in cash leaving the country during the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday that reports  
of four prosecutors and 15 FBI agents investigating the Salt Lake 
Olympics case were ``not too far off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a pretty substantial presence out there in terms of  
lawyers and investigators,'' Holder said, declining to provide any 
details about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	He said say Justice investigators were trying to get information  
from the other investigations under way.

<HEADLINE> AMA, Chamber Discuss HMO Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders from business and doctor groups deeply  
divided over proposals to regulate HMOs found little to agree on 
after spending part of this week together at a Florida resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the meeting was declared a success by participants  
from both camps if only because it reinforced their belief to keep 
searching for common ground before Congress imposes a solution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all would believe that, despite some areas of disagreement,  
we could better come up with solutions than the politicians,'' said 
Bruce Josten of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Convened by the Chamber and the American Medical Association to  
talk about long-term solutions to systemic problems, the Palm 
Beach, Fla., meeting inevitably careered into proposals in Congress 
to address patient concerns over managed care, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had the opportunity to clarify some areas where we  
have extraordinarily different perspectives,'' said Dr. Nancy 
Dickey, the AMA's president. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA brought its top lobbyists. And the Chamber brought the  
heads of Washington's insurance associations, including the trade 
group for HMOs, along with several of its own lobbyists. 
Altogether, about 25 participants spent two days in talks that 
ended Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to figure out what are the areas of commonality  
and agreement and what are the areas of disagreement,'' said 
Josten. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the discussion, he said, involved how to get health  
insurance to some 43 million uninsured Americans. Participants 
considered various changes to the tax code -- an idea that is also 
being widely discussed on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups hope that, at some point, they can agree on a set of  
recommendations. For now, they have agreed to meet again. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got the people that pay, the people that put the plans  
together and the people that provide the care,'' Josten said. 
``That's an awfully powerful coalition of health care people in 
this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only major players missing from the meeting were consumer  
advocates, though the AMA said it was speaking on behalf of 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The business and medical communities have been at odds the past  
couple of years over what any federal mandates should cover. Areas 
of disagreement include: 
</P>
<P>
	--Business opposes new mandates, but doctors are demanding more  
control over a health system that is now ruled largely by insurance 
companies with the power to deny access and treatment they believe 
is not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	--Doctors want HMOs to face liability to suits from patients if  
they deny care. Business complains it will end up paying for large 
verdicts through increased premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	--Physicians also want Congress to require insurance companies to  
pay for all ``medically necessary'' care. Business and HMOs say 
that amounts to an expensive blank check.

<HEADLINE> Phar-Mor Founder Sentence Is Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The man behind a $1 billion insider  
embezzlement that plundered the Phar-Mor Inc. drugstore chain will 
have to spend less time in prison, a judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Monus' sentence was reduced Wednesday by eight years,  
and a $1 million fine was cut in half. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge George White acted under orders from  
the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said his 1995 sentence 
of 19 years and seven months gave too much weight to some factors, 
including the amount of the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Monus, 51, has already served 39 months.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Monus and his top lieutenants embezzled  
millions of dollars from Youngstown-based Phar-Mor to finance high 
living and prop up the World Basketball League, Monus' failed 
minor-league sports venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Phar-Mor estimated its losses at $500 million. Prosecutors put  
the total loss, including about $1 billion lost by investors, at up 
to $2 billion.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Gerald Dickler, a lawyer who represented artists  
and broadcasters, including some who were blacklisted in the 
McCarthy era, died Saturday at 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickler began his legal career in the 1930s, providing unpaid  
legal help to organize the first radio workers' union, a forerunner 
to the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, he joined others to buy an Albany radio station

television personality John Henry Faulk, who was fired in 1955 amid 
allegations of Communist sympathies. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, Dickler was chairman of the  
Pollock-Krasner Foundation, which he helped establish in 1985 under 
the will of Lee Krasner, widow of painter Jackson Pollock, to offer

almost $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, he retired as a founding partner from Hall, Dickler,  
Kent, Friedman &AMP; Wood.

</P>
<P>
	Born in Ukraine, Jelesnik fled with his mother and aunt to the  
United States to escape the Russian Revolution. He began his career 
as a musician in 1935 in New York City, where he was discovered by 
vaudeville performer Sophie Tucker. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	Mattingly cared for Eisenhower from the time he entered the  
White House in January 1953 until his death in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The cardiologist served 24 years in the Army, rising to

Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II, he commanded field hospitals in the South  
Pacific.

University of California, San Diego, and a scientist who broke new 
ground in discovering how fireflies light up, died Wednesday of 
respiratory failure. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	McElroy took the helm of the UCSD campus in 1972 and served  
until 1980 when he returned to research, writing and teaching 
biology. Under his leadership, the campus research budget went from 
$40 million to more than $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He was perhaps best known for isolating and crystallizing the  
compounds that allow a firefly to light up. His research in 
bacterial bioluminescence resulted in nearly 200 original 
scientific articles. 
</P>
<P>
	Years of research led him to conclude that the light gave them  
an advantage in mating. McElroy and his late wife, biochemist 
Marlene DeLuca, were pioneers in the field of bioluminescence. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Two Olympic Committee Execs Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Salt Lake Organizing Committee  
attorney who was on the team that plied International Olympic 
Committee members with cash and freebies will remain on the job, 
SLOC president Mitt Romney decided Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Flint, senior vice president of marketing and legal  
affairs, has been on paid leave since Jan. 8, when chief executive 
officer Frank Joklik and senior vice president David Johnson 
resigned. Former president Tom Welch was stripped of his lucrative 
pension and consulting contract during the same house cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
	Licensing director Rod Hamson will remain on paid leave pending  
further evaluation in the next 30 days, said spokesman Caroline 
Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Flint and Hamson declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	An independent ethics panel last week blamed Johnson and Welch,  
the two top executives during Salt Lake's run for the 2002 Winter 
Games, for spending more than $1 million in cash, free vacations, 
living stipends, shopping sprees and free medical care on IOC 
members and their families prior to the 1995 IOC vote for Salt 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Flint and Hamson were not responsible for the excesses, but  
Flint signed some checks and Hamson prepared vouchers for checks 
that allowed sons and daughters of IOC members to attend American 
universities or simply to live in the United States, the ethics 
panel reported. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC's compensation committee unanimously recommended Flint's  
return to the SLOC. But the final decision was left to Romney, who 
has been hailed as the executive who can help Salt Lake recover 
both its Olympic footing and its image. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney agreed with the recommendation, Shaw said.  
</P>
<P>
	When he accepted the job last week, Romney said he will raise  
the ethical bar and require all employees and trustees to sign a 
code of ethics. And he asked trustees who ``cast a shadow on the 
games, even where no wrong may have been done,'' to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Utah House of Representatives voted 70-0 to hold SLOC's  
board to its promise of conducting business in public with open 
meetings and records. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would require as a condition for using  
taxpayer-built sports venues that the Olympic organization open 
many of its contemporary internal records to anyone who asks for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second in a series of Olympic reform mandates to  
clear the House or Senate, where lawmakers are demanding more 
accountability and oversight of the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Mormon church acknowledged its family history department  
researched the genealogy of Richard Pound, the IOC vice president 
from Canada who is leading the IOC investigation into the scandal, 
and presented him with a family history. 
</P>
<P>
	Such gifts of goodwill are common when prominent people visit  
the Salt Lake headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, the church said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	No value could be affixed to the gift because volunteers and  
staffers worked on it during slack times, the church said. Family 
histories purchased commercially can run into the tens of thousands 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The church noted that Pound supplied much of his own  
genealogical data on computer disk and that the gift was made two 
years after the IOC voted to give Salt Lake the games.

<HEADLINE> Chiefs Sign Cornerback Gray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Kansas City Chiefs agreed to terms  
Thursday with cornerback Carlton Gray on a five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, a six-year veteran who was released last week by the  
Giants, will help fill the void left by Dale Carter, who signed 
with Denver earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray could be a starter this fall if the Chiefs don't sign  
Darrien Gordon or Ashley Ambrose, both free-agent cornerbacks. Both 
visited with the Chiefs on Wednesday but neither has signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray started three seasons with the Seahawks and one with the  
Colts before going to the Giants.

<HEADLINE> Gebhard's Thoughts With Galarraga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Andres Galarraga's career was in a tailspin  
before the Colorado Rockies gave him a chance at revival in the 
Rocky Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the original Rockies in 1993, Galarraga blossomed into  
Colorado's most prolific power hitter before signing with the 
Atlanta Braves after the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he no longer plays in Denver, news Thursday that  
Galarraga had been diagnosed with cancer in lower back quickly 
caught the attention of his former team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad for him. I feel bad for his family. It's a sad  
day,'' said Rockies general manager Bob Gebhard, who met Galarraga 
when the first baseman was a 16-year-old in the Montreal Expos 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the last guy in the world you would expect to come up  
with that because he was a big strong healthy individual. To have 
that knock him backwards...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, 37, holds several Colorado career and season records,  
including his 150 RBIs in 1996, and was a favorite with Rockies 
fans, who lamented Colorado's decision to let him sign with the 
Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody thought his career was over in St. Louis after the  
1992 season,'' Gebhard said. ``He came back out charging. He's been 
an outstanding player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors are optimistic Galarraga can beat cancer and resume his  
career in 2000. Gebhard would love to see ``The Big Cat'' prowl 
again even if it's in the opposing dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball-wise, he's up there in age, but he's still a young  
man,'' Gebhard said. ``... Let's keep our fingers crossed and say a 
prayer for him.''

<HEADLINE> Rev. Lyons Won't Testify at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- After the Rev. Henry Lyons declined to  
testify in his racketeering trial, his co-defendant and alleged 
mistress told jurors she didn't advise Lyons of her own criminal 
conviction when she began working for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernice Edwards and Lyons, president of the National Baptist  
Convention USA, are accused of swindling more than $4 million from 
corporations seeking to do business with the influential black 
church organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Lyons and Ms. Edwards duped companies into  
believing the convention had 8.5 million members and a membership 
list that would allow the companies to target marketing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Without telling jurors she was convicted in 1993 of  
embezzlement, Ms. Edwards said Thursday that she was put on 
probation for three years shortly before meeting Lyons at a church 
function. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't something that I was proud of,'' she said. ``I had  
made a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards said she did not tell Lyons about the conviction  
when she began working to help his election as president, but did 
inform him of it before being hired as the convention's public 
relations director. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards, who has been described as Lyons' girlfriend, denied  
there was any romantic involvement when he offered her the public 
relations job in 1994. Prosecutors say the two used the money to 
buy an expensive waterfront home, luxury cars and diamond jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Lyons said his decision not to testify was made  
partly because he faces a federal trial in April on charges of 
fraud, extortion and money laundering.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Slow Light to a Crawl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Scientists have managed to slow down light so much  
that if it were a car on a highway, it could get a ticket for not 
getting over to the right-hand lane. 
</P>
<P>
	The speed of light is normally about 186,000 miles per second,  
or fast enough to go around the world seven times in the wink of 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists succeeded in slowing it down to 38 mph.  
</P>
<P>
	They did this by shooting a laser through extremely cold sodium  
atoms, which worked like ``optical molasses'' to slow the light 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	While slow-speed light now is just a laboratory plaything for  
top physicists, Lene Vesergaard Hau, the Danish scientist who led 
the project, said practical applications could be a few years away. 
She envisions improved communications technology, switches, even 
night-vision devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The atoms were contained in what is called a Bose-Einstein  
condensate, a condition created when matter is cooled almost to 
absolute zero, the lowest temperature theoretically possible. 
That's 459.67 degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have really created an optical medium with crazy, bizarre  
properties,'' Hau said. ``Everybody knows that light is something 
that goes incredibly fast. If you could possibly slow it down to a 
real human dimension. That was really fantastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The research, conducted at the Rowland Institute for Science in  
Cambridge and Harvard University, was described in Thursday's issue 
of the journal Nature.

<HEADLINE>  Mariners' Buhner Works Out at First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Jay Buhner, coming off major surgery on his  
right elbow, was at first base Thursday for the Seattle Mariners' 
first workout of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Buhner's goal is to start the season in left field, but he was  
working at first under the tutelage of regular first baseman David 
Segui. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want Jay around David as much as possible during spring  
training,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``David will be the best 
teacher we have here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Segui and Buhner worked on the side because position players  
don't officially report until Tuesday. Mariners pitchers and 
catchers reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a challenge, but big league players thrive on  
challenges,'' said Buhner, a former All-Star and Gold Glove right 
fielder. ``I want to see how good I can be at that position 
(first). It certainly makes for a more interesting spring 
training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buhner has made such strides in his rehabilitation that Piniella  
might try him in left field. But Piniella wants to bring him along 
slowly this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Jay is healthy, what I would like to see us do is have him  
play at first base when we rest David,'' Piniella said. ``We want a 
flow of keeping everybody rested and everybody playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Segui said he has made one suggestion to Buhner: Wear a  
protective cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's right,'' Piniella said. ``The ball gets over there in a  
hurry.''

<HEADLINE> PETA Protests Federal Hog Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six animal-rights protesters were charged with  
misdemeanor trespassing and fined Thursday after they chained 
themselves inside the Agriculture Department to protest government 
subsidies for hog farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sat  
on the floor just under the office of Agriculture Secretary Dan 
Glickman and chanted ``jail not bail for pig farmers'' for more 
than an hour before they were removed. 
</P>
<P>
	They were fined $25 each for the incident and released,  
according to officials with Federal Protective Services, which has 
jurisdiction over federal buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman is in South Africa this week.  
</P>
<P>
	The government last month announced a $50 million aid package  
for pork farmers, who are receiving record low prices. In December, 
farmers got as low as $8 to $10 per 100 pounds compared to $45 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork producers recently asked for about $500 million more,  
saying they were still in danger of losing their livelihoods 
because of low prices.

<HEADLINE> Fedorov Gives Salary to Charity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit Red Wings star Sergei Fedorov is  
contributing his entire $2 million salary for 1998-99 to a new 
charity that will help area children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hockey has provided me with a means to an exciting and  
fulfilling life,'' he said Thursday, announcing the creation of the 
Sergei Fedorov Foundation. ``I am fortunate to be here, and I 
appreciate everything that I have because I know what it is like to 
struggle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fedorov said the charity would give money to a variety of  
causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, he said, it will form a partnership with  
Orchards Children's Services. Together, the two groups will create 
a specialized day camp for autistic and developmentally disabled 
children, Fedorov said. He said they also will give scholarships 
for students from at-risk backgrounds to attend Michigan 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Sergei to identify with kids who are from a difficult  
environment and lend his time and support to help them succeed is a 
wonderful, meaningful contribution,'' said Orchards chief executive 
Gerald Levin. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation also will give $91 to local charities for each  
goal the team scores for the rest of the season, Fedorov said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Slip / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen in morning trading  
Friday, pushed up by comments by Japanese officials supporting the 
U.S. currency. Stock prices slipped in light trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.31 yen in late morning, up 1.63 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and also higher than its level of 119.81 yen 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average fell 23.73 points, or 0.17 percent, to  
14,123.06 points at the end of the morning session. On Thursday, 
the index slipped 11.88 points, or 0.08 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar benefited from comments from Japanese officials in  
favor of the U.S. currency's recent surge against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the G-7 group of  
industrialized nations does not think recent dollar-yen exchange 
rates were out of line from Japan's economic fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa was scheduled to leave later Friday to attend the G-7  
meeting in Bonn, Germany, this weekend. The Group of Seven includes 
the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate regular news conference, Taichi Sakaiya, the chief  
of the Economic Planning Agency, said he considers around 120 yen 
to be an appropriate level for the dollar in light of economic 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's strength followed its rise in New York, where it  
briefly broke through 120 yen for the first time since Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency has been rising against the yen this week  
following various moves by Japan's financial authorities to lower 
long-term interest rates here, which had surged dangerously high. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said U.S. funds led a dollar-buying spree Friday after  
the Japanese Finance Ministry's Trust Fund Bureau purchased $831 
million in government bonds outright, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase had been expected. It was part of the Finance  
Ministry's package of measures announced Tuesday to ease pressure 
on the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 1.47 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,093.80. 
The TOPIX had shed 1.81 points, or 0.16 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond  
fell to 1.845 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.875 percent, 
driving its price up to 99.64 yen from 99.40.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Release Cornelius Bennett </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The NFC champion Atlanta Falcons took the first  
step toward revamping their aging defense by releasing five-time 
Pro Bowler Cornelius Bennett, the team's leading tackler on the way 
to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The stunning move, announced Wednesday in a three-paragraph  
statement, opens an outside linebacker position for Keith Brooking, 
last year's No. 1 draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	By releasing Bennett, who will be 34 by the start of next  
season, the Falcons eliminated a salary that would have counted 
$3.7 million against the cap in 1999. He was entering the final 
season of a four-year, $13.6 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons are about $7 million under the projected salary cap  
for next season, providing plenty of financial room to address 
other needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Brooking adds youth to a defensive unit that had  
five starters over the age of 30. After a slow start, the rookie 
was playing regularly in passing situations by the end of the 
season, and he had eight tackles against Minnesota in the NFC 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a No. 1 draft choice we think can play and we've got  
to get him on the field,'' coach Dan Reeves told the Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution. ``Cornelius proved he can still play well, 
and this also gives him a chance to see what his market value is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Harold Richardson stressed that the decision to  
cut Bennett had nothing to do with any off-field problems, a touchy 
subject for the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety Eugene Robinson was accused of soliciting an undercover  
police officer for sex the night before the Super Bowl, and 
receiver Tony Martin was indicted on federal money laundering and 
conspiracy charges last week. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Bennett spent 35 days in a New York jail for sexual  
misconduct, but he returned to have his best season with the 
Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't anything extraordinary,'' Richardson said.  
``There's no hidden agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett's agent, Eugene Parker of Fort Wayne, Ind., did not  
return a telephone message left at his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Supposedly one of the NFL's most upstanding players, Bennett's  
reputation took a severe blow after a May 1997 sexual encounter in 
a Buffalo hotel room. The female victim was treated for trauma and 
skin cuts, and Bennett, who is married, pleaded guilty to sexual 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The linebacker entered counseling and became a born-again  
Christian. According to his teammates and coaches, he returned to 
the Falcons with a new outlook on life and became one of the 
leading figures in the improbable run to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett led the team with 121 tackles, ending Jessie Tuggle's  
nine-year streak in that category, and also broke up eight passes 
and recovered two fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett was a Pro Bowler during five of his nine seasons with  
the Buffalo Bills, establishing himself as one of the game's most 
dominating defensive players. He played in four straight Super 
Bowls with the Bills, who lost each time. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett became a five-time loser when Denver defeated the  
Falcons 34-19 in the title game 2 1/2 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to walk away from this game with a long face,''  
he said afterwards in the locker room at Pro Player Stadium. ``I'm 
a very special, very blessed athlete to have a chance to play in 
five Super Bowls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other moves Wednesday involving the Falcons, free-agent  
safety Devin Bush signed a four-year contract with the St. Louis 
Rams and offensive lineman Dave Widell was released along with 
Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, 25, was a first-round selection by the Falcons out of  
Florida State in 1995. He started 36 games for Atlanta but was 
relegated to a backup role this past season after the team signed 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Widell, 33, played only one game during his lone season with the  
Falcons. The 11-year veteran, who also has played with 
Jacksonville, Denver and Detroit, was inactive for the final 14 
games of the regular season and all three playoff games.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 103.16 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks rose Thursday as investors,  
perhaps using proceeds from their recent sales of technology 
shares, began nibbling at a broad selection of consumer and 
manufacturing stocks. Broad-market indexes rose more modestly, as a 
recovery in technology stocks proved uneven. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 103.16 to 9,298.63,  
recovering everything it lost on Wednesday plus 1.6 point. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow opened stronger, dipped briefly into negative territory  
but then resumed climbing in late morning and never looked back. 
With one trading session left, the Dow is up nearly 24 points for 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators ended moderately higher, with the  
Nasdaq composite up 11.64 at 2,260.55, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500 composite up 13.25 at 1,237.28. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tone of the market again failed to impress traders and  
technicians, who have been complaining for some time that even on 
days when the Dow finishes higher, the trend isn't confirmed across 
the entire market. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a respectable 1.1-percent gain in the Dow, for example,  
advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a relatively narrow 
7-to-4 margin on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume on the New 
York Stock Exchange was a moderate 895.77 million shares, which 
traders cited as a lack of conviction even though it beat 
Wednesday's volume slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The breadth tells me the whole story,'' said Larry Rice, chief  
investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co. ``The rallies are very 
narrow, and the sell-offs kill you. There's really been very little 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dow industrials that moved higher included General Motors, up 3  
at 85 9/16; Merck, up 1 11/16 at 77 7/8; and IBM, up 3 3/4 at 174 1/4, as 
investors looked anywhere they could for reasonably priced 
replacements for the computer-related shares they have been selling 
all week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are really going after these consumer cyclicals like  
retail and autos,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment officer at 
BankBoston, ``but I don't think it's a sustainable leadership 
simply because we're in the eighth year of a recovery and one would 
think the pent-up demand for things like autos has long been 
exhausted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services issues were mixed after an announcement that  
Dutch insurer Aegon NV is buying the U.S. life insurance company 
TransAmerica Corp. for $9.7 billion in cash and stock. 
TransAmerican shares surged 15 1/4 to 72 7/8, and Aegon's American 
depositary shares rose 5 1/8 to 99 7/8. Insurance and brokerage stocks 
were moistly higher. 
</P>
<P>
	But banking issues fell as interest rates rose in the bond  
market, with the 30-year Treasury yield up to 5.38 percent from 
5.31 percent Wednesday. Dow member Citigroup eased 1/8 to 52 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology issues were also mixed. Compaq fell 7/16 to 40 9/16  
in leading volume on the Big Board. Dell Computer, whose earnings 
release late Tuesday has been dragging the market down, was up 1

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 43.18 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials had climbed out of an  
early slump into positive territory by midday, but the broader 
market was still languishing, as this week's sell-off in technology 
shares continued. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
43.18 at 9,238.65, after opening stronger, then dipping to a loss 
of 4.27 before recovering again. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Dow dropped 101.56, losing 95 points in the  
final hour, in a fierce sell-off led by technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators turned mixed after a shaky opening,  
with the Nasdaq composite down 1.28 at 2,247.63, and the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 composite up 6.14 at 1,230.17. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow 9-to-8 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 329.15 million 
shares, down from Wednesday's pace of 392.78 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The breadth tells me the whole story,'' said Larry Rice, chief  
investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co. ``The rallies are very 
narrow, and the sell-offs kill you. There's really been very little 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technology issues were again the lead dogs today, as they have  
been since late last week. On the New York Stock Exchange, Compaq 
was down 1 at 40in leading volume on the Big Board. Dell Computer, 
whose earnings release late Tuesday has been dragging the market 
down since last Friday, was up 15/16 at 82 1/2 in leading Nasdaq 
volume, but it was followed by Microsoft, down 4 3/8 at 145 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	But blue chips found their legs after a shaky opening. The Dow  
industrials were led higher by General Motors, up 2 5/8 at 85 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are really going after these consumer cyclicals like  
retail and autos,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment officer at 
BankBoston, but he added, ``I don't think it's a sustainable 
leadership simply because we're in the eighth year of a recovery 
and one would think the pent-up demand for things like autos has 
long been exhausted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported this morning that its Producer  
Price Index rose 0.5 percent in January, the most since October 
1996. But minus the volatile food and energy components, prices 
edged 0.1 percent lower, alleviating investors' fears that 
inflationary signals might prompt the Federal Reserve to raise 
short-term interest rates.

<HEADLINE> New Fee Showing Up on Phone Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yet another new fee is beginning to appear on  
monthly telephone bills. The charge, typically about 50 cents a 
month for each phone line, is intended to help pave the way for the 
day when customers can change local carriers as easily as 
long-distance providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some local phone companies began billing for the new fee in  
February; others plan to do so over the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge pays for the local phone companies' costs of  
complying with a provision in a 1996 law. Businesses also will pay 
a fee, depending on the services they get. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge covers the companies' cost for technical changes they  
must make so consumers can keep their phone numbers after they have 
switched to a new local phone provider. Those changes could cost 
the industry $3 billion over five years, under one phone company 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	The concept of portable phone numbers is not new. For years,  
long-distance customers have been able to change their 
long-distance carriers without getting a new phone number. 
</P>
<P>
	The rationale: Consumers would be less inclined to switch to a  
new carrier -- local or long-distance -- if they had to get a new 
phone number each time. That would thwart the goal of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But most residential customers do not have a choice of local  
telephone providers. Local phone competition that has evolved since 
the 1996 law mainly focuses on lucrative, high-volume business 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with this charge is it's making all consumers pay  
a price for something that most of them do not have and the vast 
majority probably will not get: That is -- a choice of local phone 
companies,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers 
Union Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC last year gave phone companies permission to charge the  
new fees to recover their costs of providing ``number 
portability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, the FCC said the charge could start no earlier  
than Feb. 1, 1999, and last no longer than five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, consumers were hit with new monthly fees on their  
phone bills. Those charges came from a 1997 government overhaul of 
phone fees and from itemized charges for government-ordered 
subsidies once included in rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Like those fees, the newest charges are broken out in phone  
bills, under different names. They come in addition to the 
multitude of existing charges for federal, state or local taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech, the main local phone provider in five Midwestern  
states, is charging customers 41 cents a line per month, said 
spokesman Marvin Wamble. The fee is appearing on bills as the 
``number portability surcharge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SBC Communications' Southwestern Bell, the main provider of  
local phone service in Texas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and 
Arkansas, is charging 48 cents a line per month. SBC's local phone 
businesses serving California and Nevada are charging 50 cents a 
month per line, said SBC spokesman Selim Bingol. SBC is identifying 
the fee as the ``local number portability service charge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	US West plans to charge customers in its 14-state local phone  
territory 53 cents a line per month, beginning in the March billing 
cycle, said spokesman David Beigie. US West's charge reflect the 
company's added expense of making technical changes to its network, 
which spans many rural and remote areas in the West and Northwest, 
he said. The fee will appear on bills as ``federal charge -- service 
provider number portability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission, however, is reviewing the  
fee to determine whether it is justified. So there's a possibility 
the fee could be changed. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE, which provides local service in 28 states, will charge  
customers 43 cents a line. The fee will appear in bills after March 
10, and is called the ``service provider number portability fee,'' 
GTE spokesman Bob Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth has not set its monthly fee yet, but spokesman Bill  
McCloskey said the company expects it to ``come in well under 50 
cents per line.'' The company is considering charging the fee 
beginning in May, McCloskey said. BellSouth is the main local phone 
provider in nine southern states. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, which provides local phone service from Maine to  
Virginia, also has not determined its charges, said spokeswoman 
Susan Butta. Neither has SBC-owned Southern New England 
Telecommunications, which provides local service in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	When portable phone numbers were introduced to the long-distance  
industry, long-distance companies' recovered their costs through 
fees typically passed along to their customers. Those fees do not 
exist anymore.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Arrives for Clinton Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- French President Jacques Chirac is using a  
two-day visit to the United States to demonstrate there is more 
that unites the two old allies than divides them. 
</P>
<P>
	But differences do exist, on Iraq and currency alignment.  
</P>
<P>
	Chirac arrived today for talks with President Clinton that will  
focus on security issues in Europe and reform of the global 
financial system. He also will see the heads of the International 
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development 
Bank. Chirac is staying at Blair House, across Pennsylvania Avenue 
from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the two leaders would  
discuss Kosovo, NATO's 50th anniversary summit in Washington in 
April, Iraq, Russia and global financial issues. 
</P>
<P>
	After lunch Friday, they are scheduled to hold a joint news  
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac has said France and the United States are on the same  
wavelength on Kosovo. France is hosting talks aimed at bringing 
peace to the war-torn Serbian province and has set Saturday as a 
deadline for the two sides to reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in Paris with The Associated Press before his  
departure, Chirac bristled at the idea the United States and France 
are competitors, even though they differ on some foreign policy 
issues, particularly the recent U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``France is not worried about a powerful United States,'' Chirac  
said. ``In the world today it is a real necessity. France wants to 
be part of a strong Europe and we do as much as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like the idea of presenting Europe and the United  
States as competitors,'' Chirac added. ``We have the same values. 
We are two great democracies. We are partners and we must be great 
partners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Iraq, Chirac emphasized common points with Washington rather  
than differences. ``I wouldn't say that French and American policy 
are so different,'' he said. ``We both agree about the 
responsibility of Saddam Hussein.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he also referred to a French plan he intends to raise with  
Clinton, under which Iraq would agree to allow weapons inspections 
in return for lifting the U.N. embargo on its oil, which Chirac 
argues hurts the Iraqi people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing is that France asks: What shall we do after the  
bombs?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, whose objective is to topple Saddam, is  
skeptical about the French plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac also wants to make progress on reducing world financial  
volatility. ``The world financial system needs to be changed 
because the world has changed. ... I think we should have better 
organization,'' Chirac said. 
</P>
<P>
	France has proposed assigning trading levels, or bands, for  
currencies to reduce volatility among the dollar, Europe's new 
euro, and the Japanese yen, an idea Germany and Japan support. 
Countries would be committed to intervene by buying and selling 
currencies on the open market to maintain those exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Clinton supports those calling for a new global  
``financial architecture'' to prevent future Asian-style currency 
crises, the United States remains opposed to setting target ranges 
for currency values. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Wednesday he believed such  
proposals would probably at some point be at odds with U.S. 
domestic economic interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac also wants to improve market regulation and to involve  
the private sector in the solution of financial crises.

<HEADLINE>  Pa. Man Bought Simpson's Heisman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The man who bought O.J. Simpson's Heisman  
Trophy came forward publicly today, saying he planned to have some 
fun with it and already has impressed his girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody's been calling,'' said Tom ``Juice'' Kriessman, 47, a  
Philadelphia steel company owner. ``Seems everybody wants to touch 
it, everybody wants to be photographed with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He made the high bid Tuesday -- $255,500 including the premium  
paid to the auction house -- at the court-ordered auction of various 
Simpson memorabilia. The trophy was awarded to Simpson in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	As he showed up to collect the trophy at the Butterfield &AMP;  
Butterfield auction house, Kriessman told reporters he had heard 
the Heisman might fetch $100,000. He told his girlfriend he'd pay 
that amount and she was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to impress my girlfriend. So, it's done that, and  
also it's an investment,'' said Kriessman, who would not identify 
his company. ``We're going to have some fun with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale Tuesday raised $430,000. Proceeds will help pay off the  
$33.5 million Simpson owes for the wrongful death judgment in the 
1994 killings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend 
Ronald Goldman. A civil jury found him liable for the deaths after 
he was acquitted of criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, several items sold at the auction were destroyed  
as a protest of that acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Boos and cheers erupted when two No. 32 football jerseys and a  
Professional Football Hall of Fame induction certificate were set 
ablaze and two trophies were smashed outside the Criminal Courts 
Building. The protest was organized by Christian radio talk show 
host Bob Enyart of Denver, who had bought the items. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are destroying O.J. Simpson's property in front of the L.A.  
courthouse because the criminal justice system is destroying 
justice before our very eyes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said the money could have been spent on better causes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I should say thank you for paying off $16,000 of my  
debt,'' Simpson said Wednesday in a telephone interview with The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``I wonder about the mentality involved in this. The guy's  
burning up $16,000 he could use to fight AIDS or help kids with 
cancer or even donate to battered (women's) homes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some spectators also disagreed with the destruction of the  
items. Yolanda Harris likened it to defacing the flag and said the 
items should have gone to his children. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a legacy. It had nothing to do with what he did,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the items auctioned by phone, in person and over the  
Internet were Tiffany-style lamps, artwork and a fox fur coat that 
belonged to Simpson's first wife, Marguerite. It went for $550. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson, who is appealing the judgment, said the sum raised by  
the auction proves the civil court award was illegal, since his 
suable worth was only $430,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave a judgment that is 77 times more than that,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Money raised by the court-ordered auction goes to the estate of  
Ms. Simpson and Goldman's family. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton in N.H. Talking Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         %) *By SONYA ROSS 	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	DOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Officially, he talked about health care and  
raised money for Democrats. Unofficially, Bill Clinton returned 
today to the state where he proclaimed himself ``the Comeback Kid'' 
for a comeback of a different sort. 
</P>
<P>
	The president flew to New Hampshire today for his first foray  
among the people since his impeachment acquittal last week. He 
convened a panel discussion of health care and touted his plan to 
use the projected federal budget surplus to shore up Social 
Security and Medicare, his comments peppered with memories of the 
way things were in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would very much like to see the spirit in the country and in  
Washington, D.C., that I felt here in New Hampshire so many years 
ago ... to take these health care issues and sort of put them 
beyond partisan politics,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of the surplus, Clinton said, ``was an  
inconceivable discussion in 1991 and 1992 in New Hampshire.'' He 
recalled an elderly couple he met at a Nashua, N.H., seniors center 
then, who said they regularly would skip meals so they could save 
their money for prescription medicines. He said people like them 
would be helped if Congress goes along with his plan for the budget 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will cost money in the short run, (but) it will save big  
money in the long run,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was greeted by a scathing front-page editorial in The Union  
Leader newspaper under the banner headline: ``Mr. President, you're 
a disgrace!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even when it was purely political, it was something special  
just to have the president of our country in our midst,'' wrote 
publisher Nackey Loeb. ``Not anymore. Not today. Not with this man. 
His party has put politics above principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president was enthusiastically received by the 200 people in  
the room where he spoke. Across the street, about 50 protesters 
huddled under umbrellas, some holding signs that said ``shame'' and 
one that said ``moron.'' Clinton's motorcade passed a woman 
clutching a poster covered in plastic that read, ``Clinton/Gore - 
'92, '96, '99 - With You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Clinton met with small groups of friends and  
supporters from his first campaign. Tonight, he was addressing the 
New Hampshire Democratic Party's 40th anniversary dinner at the 
National Guard armory in Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House says Clinton is not out to savor the victory in  
his impeachment trial. He did not mention it during the health care 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	But even White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president  
is unlikely to ignore the political significance of his visit. 
``There is something special about New Hampshire for the 
president,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	That significance is not lost on Clinton's New Hampshire  
supporters either. 
</P>
<P>
	``In lots of ways it's like a class reunion,'' said state  
Democratic Party Chairman Jeff Woodburn. ``People have a strong 
feeling that this is where it all began.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's visit marked the seventh anniversary of the 1992  
presidential primary in which Clinton came in second to the late 
Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas but acted as if he'd won. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of being dogged by questions about an affair with  
Gennifer Flowers, his Vietnam draft status, his involvement in a 
savings and loan deal that blossomed into the Whitewater 
investigation, Clinton drew 26 percent of the vote to Tsongas' 34 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``New Hampshire tonight has made Bill Clinton the Comeback  
Kid,'' Clinton said then. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the state swaggering like a bona fide contender, his  
first electoral victory, in Georgia, still a few weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he is grayer, his political battles have taken on a  
white-hot intensity and exacted a much heavier toll. Many of the 
people of New Hampshire who embraced him then are just as eager to 
embrace him now. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's returning to his roots. He remembers the people who put  
him in office,'' said George Bruno, a Manchester lawyer whom 
Clinton nominated as ambassador to Belize. ``He's here to renew 
friendships and bonds, to be part of that fresh start after the 
events of the last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's New Hampshire tour is a precursor to a similar series of  
policy and politics appearances next week in the West, where he 
will cash in on his continuing strong job approval ratings to sell 
his Social Security and Medicare programs and raise money for 
Democrats. He already has similar trips planned in March for 
Arkansas and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	One additional underlying goal for the president is to stump for  
Vice President Al Gore as his successor in the 2000 election. 
Today, Clinton reminded the audience that Gore has held forums on 
long-term health care needs around the country, and even repeated a 
joke that Gore tells often, about St. Peter allowing an HMO 
operator to enter heaven -- and limiting his stay to only three 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	``He tells it better than I do,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> US: Compaq Gave Microsoft Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a dramatic courtroom confrontation, the  
government alleged Thursday that Compaq Computer Corp. passed 
secret information to Microsoft Corp. about an upstart Microsoft 
competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	David Boies, a Justice Department lawyer, made the accusation in  
seeking to discredit testimony by a senior Compaq executive and 
Microsoft witness in the antitrust trail of the computer software 
giant. 
</P>
<P>
	The witness, John T. Rose, a senior vice president of Compaq,  
testified he was unaware that his company had passed along to 
Microsoft any confidential information about Be Inc., which also 
makes a computer operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Passing secrets obtained under a so-called nondisclosure  
agreement to another company's rival is extremely serious, the 
industry's equivalent to being caught cheating on a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft has such power in the industry that Compaq feels it  
is in Compaq's interest to share the details of confidential 
negotiations,'' Boies said. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Compaq, William Coston, called the accusation a  
``cheap trial stunt'' and complained to U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson that his courtroom was being ``sullied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ended the episode after the witness denied any  
knowledge of a disclosure. But he seemed content with assurances 
from Boies when he asked, ``You have a good-faith basis for that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Compaq lawyer, Tom Siekman, said outside the courtroom  
that the company ``takes its obligations very, very seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not appropriate to make an allegation of this kind in  
open court,'' said Siekman, who added that Compaq was 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Louis Gassee, the chairman and chief executive officer for  
Be, based in Menlo Park, Calif., said in a telephone interview with 
The Associated Press that Compaq had called him ``a little 
embarrassed'' about three months ago confessing what it described 
as an inadvertent disclosure to Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft is such a threat to the livelihood of PC (makers),  
there is a climate of fear,'' Gassee said Thursday. ``They will do 
things almost instinctively to propitiate Microsoft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's accusation was the latest in the government's theme  
that Microsoft wields its enormous influence inappropriately. The 
Justice Department charges that Microsoft violated antitrust laws 
by using its monopoly power to dissuade Compaq and others from 
doing business with Netscape and other Microsoft rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft denies that it possesses monopoly power.  
</P>
<P>
	Boies on Thursday also introduced a November 1996 e-mail from  
Compaq speculating why Microsoft was offering to share with Compaq 
money it earned from Internet subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is Microsoft making this offer? ... Microsoft does seem to  
very strongly want to get/keep Netscape Navigator off Presario 
desktops,'' Compaq executive Bob Friedman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose denied Thursday that Microsoft had exerted any pressure to  
discourage Compaq from dealing with Netscape. ``I was never aware 
of Microsoft wanting us to exclude the Netscape icon from the 
desktop,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq canceled plans in 1996 to distribute Netscape's browser  
but currently includes the software with its computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft threatened in 1996 to stop  
selling Windows to Compaq, which was distributing Netscape's 
browser but also had removed easy access to Microsoft's. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq has said it mistakenly made that change under a 1995  
agreement with America Online Inc. stipulating that AOL's Internet 
icons would be the only ones easily accessible to consumers. And it 
has said that Microsoft was correct to object. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge cast doubt on the explanation Thursday, saying the  
Microsoft-Compaq agreement was dated August 1995 but was not signed 
nor executed until June 1996. The disparity ``makes no sense at all 
if this was a genuine agreement,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq is widely believed to enjoy among the lowest prices that  
Microsoft charges any computer maker, but the actual costs are 
among the industry's most closely guarded secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Compaq e-mail introduced by Boies refers to two new  
contracts Compaq and Microsoft signed last spring. The e-mail said 
Compaq wanted dual contracts ``given Microsoft's concern that our 
agreement be 'defendable' to other (computer makers) and the 
Department of Justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Compaq and Microsoft have a special relationship,'' Boies  
said. ``You have to take that into account when evaluating what the 
people from Compaq say and do.''

<HEADLINE>  Pa. Man Bought Simpson's Heisman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The man who bought O.J. Simpson's Heisman  
Trophy came forward publicly today, saying he planned to have some 
fun with it and already has impressed his girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody's been calling,'' said Tom ``Juice'' Kriessman, 47, a  
Philadelphia steel company owner. ``Seems everybody wants to touch 
it, everybody wants to be photographed with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He made the high bid Tuesday -- $255,500 including the premium  
paid to the auction house -- at the court-ordered auction of various 
Simpson memorabilia. The trophy was awarded to Simpson in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	As he showed up to collect the trophy at the Butterfield &AMP;  
Butterfield auction house, Kriessman told reporters he had heard 
the Heisman might fetch $100,000. He told his girlfriend he'd pay 
that amount and she was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to impress my girlfriend. So, it's done that, and  
also it's an investment,'' said Kriessman, who would not identify 
his company. ``We're going to have some fun with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale Tuesday raised $430,000. Proceeds will help pay off the  
$33.5 million Simpson owes for the wrongful death judgment in the 
1994 killings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend 
Ronald Goldman. A civil jury found him liable for the deaths after 
he was acquitted of criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, several items sold at the auction were destroyed  
as a protest of that acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Boos and cheers erupted when two No. 32 football jerseys and a  
Professional Football Hall of Fame induction certificate were set 
ablaze and two trophies were smashed outside the Criminal Courts 
Building. The protest was organized by Christian radio talk show 
host Bob Enyart of Denver, who had bought the items. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are destroying O.J. Simpson's property in front of the L.A.  
courthouse because the criminal justice system is destroying 
justice before our very eyes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said the money could have been spent on better causes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I should say thank you for paying off $16,000 of my  
debt,'' Simpson said Wednesday in a telephone interview with The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``I wonder about the mentality involved in this. The guy's  
burning up $16,000 he could use to fight AIDS or help kids with 
cancer or even donate to battered (women's) homes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some spectators also disagreed with the destruction of the  
items. Yolanda Harris likened it to defacing the flag and said the 
items should have gone to his children. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a legacy. It had nothing to do with what he did,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the items auctioned by phone, in person and over the  
Internet were Tiffany-style lamps, artwork and a fox fur coat that 
belonged to Simpson's first wife, Marguerite. It went for $550. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson, who is appealing the judgment, said the sum raised by  
the auction proves the civil court award was illegal, since his 
suable worth was only $430,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave a judgment that is 77 times more than that,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Money raised by the court-ordered auction goes to the estate of  
Ms. Simpson and Goldman's family. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Test Could Help Pork Producers / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new test designed by Agriculture Department  
researchers could help detect a disease-causing bacteria that cost 
pork producers some $17 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests now can take five to seven days and are not always  
reliable. But a scientist with the Agricultural Research Service in 
Ames, Iowa, has designed a test that does the job in just three 
days. Extra time gives farmers a chance to cut losses by combining 
treatments such as antibiotic therapy, vaccination and getting rid 
of the sick pigs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two bacteria are the culprits behind atrophic rhinitis, which  
leads to weight loss and delays in delivering pork to market. Pigs 
with this disease also are susceptible to pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease, which is highly contagious and spreads quickly  
among pigs in confinement houses, is linked to two toxin-producing 
bacteria. The bacteria reduce long bone growth, causing shortened 
and twisted snouts on severely infected pigs. 
</P>
<P>
	But detecting the disease can create costly delays for farmers  
because snout deformities are not always obvious. Karen B. 
Register, a molecular microbiologist with the Agricultural Research 
Service, has designed a test using probes made from the genetic 
material of the bacteria that can produce results in three days. 
</P>
<P>
	The test targets the genes in a nasal or tonsil swab taken from  
a live pig. Bacteria in the samples are grown and placed on a 
paper-like sheet of nylon. A pink or purple color indicates the 
presence of one of the two toxin-producing bacteria. 
</P>

	FLINTSTONE, Md. (AP) -- Maryland's agricultural diversity  
nurtures an unusually large number of farms run by women. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 12 percent of the state's farms are headed by females,  
compared with less than 9 percent nationwide, according to the 
recently released 1997 census of U.S. agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference probably reflects the nature of agriculture in  
Maryland, where numerous small farms produce a wide array of crops, 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have more part-time farms and more fruit and vegetable  
farms that appeal to women. The person at the local farmers' market 
selling produce is likely to be a woman,'' said Ray Garibay, head 
of the Maryland Agricultural Statistics Service, a division of the 
U.S. Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Marla McIntosh, associate dean of academic programs at the  
University of Maryland in College Park, said 60 percent of the 
undergraduates in the school's College of Agriculture and Natural 
Resources are women. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with the Midwest, where big corn and soybean farms are  
the rule, ``Maryland has more nontraditional agriculture and more 
alternative agriculture, like greenhouse and nursery operations,'' 
Ms. McIntosh said. ``In Maryland, we have smaller farms with a 
wider variety of crops that appeal more to women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They include Mary Stickley, 72, who raises trout and beef cattle  
in Allegany County near Flintstone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good way of making a living,'' she said. ``It keeps me  
young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kristen Nickerson, 25, raises hogs with her sister, Jennifer  
Debnam, 30, near Kennedyville. They send about 6,000 hogs to market 
a year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an animal lover, and I like working outside. It's a good  
living,'' said Nickerson, who also receives income from accounting 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Some women got into farming after their husbands died. Mildred  
Darcey, 72, runs a 155-acre tobacco and grain farm near Upper 
Marlboro with the help of her sons. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I wanted to keep the farm, I knew I had to keep farming  
it,'' she said. ``I keep the books; I pay the bills and make the 
decisions.''

<HEADLINE> Turner Apologizes for Pope Jokes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Ted Turner apologized for insulting the pope with  
a Polish joke and calling for deleting the ban on adultery from the 
Ten Commandments. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement sent to the Catholic League on Wednesday night,  
the CNN founder said he ``regrets any offense his comments may have 
caused ... and extends his heartfelt apologies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner made an ethnic joke regarding Pope John Paul II, who is  
Polish, while addressing the National Family Planning and 
Reproductive Center in Washington on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what he would say if he ever met the pope, Turner  
responded, ``Ever seen a Polish mine detector?'' Turner then showed 
the audience his foot, said Marilyn Keefe, spokeswoman for the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to say that Pope John Paul II should ``get with it''  
and suggested that adultery should be removed from the Ten 
Commandments. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner, who has five children, also suggested a ``one-child''  
policy for all couples worldwide to help control the world's 
population, which he said is more than double what it should be. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Keefe said Turner did not have any prepared remarks, and  
spoke ``off the cuff.'' She said she didn't see him tell the joke 
but heard from others who had. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly accept his apology and this brings closure to the  
incident,'' said William Donahue, president of the New York-based 
Catholic League, an anti-defamation organization for Roman 
Catholics. ``What is disturbing to me is that reportedly, his 
comments were received with wild applause from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he had said the same thing about Indians or blacks, I don't  
think that would have sat too well with the people there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the first time that Turner, now vice chairman of Time  
Warner Inc., has gotten into trouble with religious groups. In 
1990, he said Christianity was ``for losers,'' but apologized at a 
church a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
	He and wife Jane Fonda donated $1 billion to the United Nations  
last year for population control programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a serious issue and we should be having a serious  
debate about it,'' Donahue said. ``But if you disagree with the 
pope, say you disagree with him, but keep your comments above 
board.''

<HEADLINE> Officials Say IOC Member Was Drunk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- An IOC member expelled in the Olympic  
bribery scandal was consistently drunk as he checked out 
Stockholm's bid for the 2004 Games and got so offensive that he was 
thrown out of a dinner party, Swedish officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan was one of two IOC  
members whose behavior was questioned by Stockholm bid leaders in a 
letter to the International Olympic Committee. A copy of the letter 
was made available to The Associated Press Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC had asked bid cities to detail any cases of improper  
behavior or requests by committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, from bid officials Goeran Laangsved and Olof  
Stenhammar, said none of the members who visited Stockholm violated 
IOC guidelines, but singled out Gadir and Lamine Keita of Mali for 
``behavior ... not up to expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gadir and Keita were ousted from the IOC last month after being  
implicated in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Gadir was ``more or less constantly under the influence of  
alcohol during his visit to Stockholm,'' in July 1997, the letter 
said, adding that he offended several guests at a dinner at 
Stenhammar's residence and was asked to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	It also noted that Gadir ordered expensive alcohol from hotel  
room service. A Swedish newspaper reported last week that a single 
room-service delivery of alcohol to Gadir's room totaled $470. 
</P>
<P>
	Keita asked the bid committee to pay him in cash for a  
round-trip air ticket between Bamako, the Mali capital, and Paris, 
the letter said. The bid committee had bought such tickets and sent 
them by courier to Keita, but he claimed he had not received them, 
the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedish national prosecutor's office, meanwhile, has  
launched an investigation into the bid committee's activities. That 
followed a report that the panel provided $200,000 for an athletes' 
exchange program the Swedish Olympic Committee signed with six 
African countries days before the IOC voted on the site for the 
games. Athens won that vote in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers also said the bid committee paid for medical care for  
several IOC members or their spouses. The bid committee said in the 
letter that those were cases of emergency needs, which it was 
obliged to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The president of the International Skiing Federation said  
winter sports officials want a major role in choosing Winter 
Olympic host cities. Gian-Franco Kasper said at least half of the 
choice of Olympic sites should be based on sports. He said it was 
``the only way to restore the credibility'' of the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The chief of the Sydney Olympics said the IOC should bear a  
share of cutbacks if the 2000 Games fall short of their marketing 
target. Sandy Hollway ruled out renegotiating the Sydney Organizing 
Committee's deal that guarantees the Australian Olympic Committee 
$65 million, regardless of the financial outcome of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Former Australian Olympics Minister Bruce Baird said Sydney  
newspapers made a secret deal not to report on the lavish wooing of 
IOC members in the city's successful bid for the 2000 Olympics. 
Newspaper officials vehemently denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The IOC agreed to postpone a visit to investigate Sydney's  
Olympic bid until after an independent audit reports its findings 
March 11. IOC vice president Jacques Rogge and director general 
Francois Carrard now will look into any unanswered questions during 
a previously scheduled April trip to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A former ski official said Salt Lake City ``robbed'' U.S.  
winter sports athletes of $3 million in unkept promises made in its 
bid for the Winter Olympics. Howard Peterson, who stepped down as 
executive director of the U.S. Skiing Association in 1994, called 
for Utah authorities to pay the money now to help get American 
athletes ready for 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The world's sports federations, led by the highest-ranking  
Olympic official implicated in the Salt Lake scandal, declared its 
support for IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. The ruling 
council of the General Association of International Sports 
Federations called for the Olympic movement to ``maintain unity.'' 
The group is led by South Korea's Kim Un-yong, who has been cited 
by IOC and Salt Lake investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Justice Department said reports of four prosecutors and 15  
FBI agents investigating the Salt Lake Olympics case were ``not too 
far off.'' ``We have a pretty substantial presence out there in 
terms of lawyers and investigators,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric 
Holder said, declining to provide any details about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Salt Lake Organizing Committee attorney who was on the  
team that plied International Olympic Committee members with cash 
and freebies will remain on the job, SLOC president Mitt Romney 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Flint, senior vice president of marketing and legal  
affairs, has been on paid leave since Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Licensing director Rod Hamson will remain on paid leave pending  
further evaluation in the next 30 days, said spokesman Caroline 
Shaw.

<HEADLINE> Warren Moon Eyes Steelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Warren Moon has played more games in Three  
Rivers Stadium than some of the Pittsburgh Steelers. No wonder he 
wouldn't mind playing there wearing black and gold, not a road 
jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Moon's interest in rejoining his former coach, new  
Pittsburgh offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride, the Steelers 
apparently don't have either the starting job or the money the 
42-year-old quarterback wants. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon, released recently by the Seattle Seahawks, visited the San  
Diego Chargers earlier this week and suggested Pittsburgh was one 
of the teams he is considering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Browns and Tampa Bay Buccaneers also are believed  
to have interest in Moon, who needs 903 yards passing to join Dan 
Marino and John Elway as the only 50,000-yard passers in NFL 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Moon would like to work again under Gilbride, the  
offensive coordinator when the two were with the Houston Oilers, 
Moon prefers to be a starter, not a backup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a guy that's very competitive,'' Moon said in San Diego.  
``I'm not a guy that wants to come in with a backup role. I want to 
go to a situation where I know I can play or think I have a good 
chance of playing, and I think I have a good chance of playing 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But no matter where Moon lands, he probably won't be a starter  
unless he signs on with the expansion Browns. He likely would back 
up Trent Dilfer in Tampa or Ryan Leaf in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	If Cleveland drafts Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch as expected,  
Moon could start for a season while helping develop Couch, who 
would then become the starter in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Cowher already has said that Kordell Stewart remains  
his starter, despite Stewart's major drop off in production as the 
Steelers slipped to a 7-9 record last season. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Steelers have considered bringing in a new backup  
quarterback to replace 36-year-old Mike Tomczak, who angered some 
team officials with his criticism of Stewart late last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomczak, who has played in Pittsburgh for seven years, tried to  
smooth over the matter when he met with Cowher after the Steelers 
lost their final five games. 
</P>
<P>
	But there still are no assurances that Tomczak will return, and  
the Steelers may talk to Jeff Hostetler, released this week by 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers were interested in signing Hostetler before the  
1997 season -- Stewart's first as an NFL starting quarterback -- but 
the two sides could not come to an agreement on salary or 
Hostetler's role. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers' biggest problem in bringing in a new backup  
quarterback might be salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomczak is scheduled to make $600,000 in 1999, a relatively low  
sum for an NFL quarterback. Moon probably would want more even as a 
backup, but the Steelers have less than $2 million remaining under 
the salary cap and still must sign a starting left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon began last season as Seattle's starting quarterback, but  
was later benched for Jon Kitna. Moon was released by the Seahawks 
after Mike Holmgren was hired as coach and general manager.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Expects D-Backs To Contend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Randy Johnson joked with teammates, signed  
autographs and promised to work on his hitting in his first day of 
spring training for the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	And although he said he wants to let bygones be bygones as far  
as Seattle is concerned, he can't wait to get a chance to pitch 
later this year in the Mariners' new Safeco Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully I'll get a chance to pitch in that new ballpark that  
me and the other 24 guys on that team in 1995 had a big part in 
building,'' Johnson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona plays a three-game interleague series at Seattle from  
July 18-20, the second series at the new field. Johnson was 
reminded it might not be his turn to pitch then, but he 
half-jokingly suggested he might put a little pressure on manager 
Buck Showalter or owner Jerry Colangelo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll do some twisting of Buck's arm and maybe even Jerry's if  
I have to,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson didn't report to spring training until Thursday, the  
first day of official workouts, because he's just getting over the 
flu. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still kind of sluggish,'' he said, ``and Buck told me to  
take it easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he was in good spirits, signing autographs as he walked  
from one field to another during the workouts at Arizona's spring 
training complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andy, I just heard you've been traded,'' Johnson said when he  
saw Benes surrounded by reporters after the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Benes, who played with Johnson in Seattle, said he knows a  
different Big Unit than the one reporters see. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Randy Johnson I know is the one who sent a stuffed animal  
and flowers to my daughter when she had surgery,'' Benes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he's much more at ease this spring than he was the  
previous two. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, he was coming off back surgery and was dealing with all  
the doubts about whether he would return to his old intimidating 
form. Last year, he was in a sour mood after the Mariners' decided 
against extending his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is probably going to be one of my better spring  
trainings,'' Johnson said. ``Last year, I had to deal with a lot of 
contract stuff and I'm really glad it's over and behind me. I wish 
the Seattle players and the organization the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners finally traded Johnson to Houston on July 31. He  
went 10-1 for the Astros, then signed a four-year, $52.4 million 
contract with Arizona. He expects the second-year team to contend 
in the NL West because of the Diamondbacks' powerful starting 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our pitching staff is as good as anybody's in the  
National League, and probably a little deeper than most teams,'' he 
said. ``You've got six guys who can be a solid starting pitcher, 
and pitching wins games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo, who watched the workout in shirtsleeves in the  
80-degree sunshine, spent nearly $100 million to add Johnson, Todd 
Stottlemyre and Armando Reynoso to the rotation that already 
included holdovers Benes and Omar Daal. The Diamondbacks also have 
another returning starter, left-hander Brian Anderson, who will be 
used as a reliever and spot starter if he isn't traded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel I'm `the' guy here,'' Johnson said. ``I didn't  
feel that I was `the' guy in Houston. I think it's safe to say that 
here there are five solid starting pitchers here, not including me. 
So the ace of the staff is whoever's pitching that day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo said he watched the workout with feelings of pride and  
accomplishment after the offseason moves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main reason I drove down here from Phoenix is to see what  
it looks like to have Randy Johnson in an Arizona Diamondbacks 
uniform,'' Colangelo said. ``It looks real good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who didn't have to hit in his 9 1/2 seasons in Seattle,  
said he will take his plate appearances seriously. He said that he 
incorporated exercises in his offseason workouts designed to help 
him swing the bat and run the bases. He's aware of the ridicule he 
received for his awkward attempts at hitting the ball after he was 
traded to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever I do on the day that I pitch I want to do to the best  
of my ability,'' Johnson said. ``I take a great deal of pride in my 
pitching, and if I'm going to be up there hitting, I want to take a 
great deal of pride in my hitting. I don't want to be some kind of 
joke up there. I realize my hitting could possibly keep me in the 
game, so I'll do whatever it takes.''

<HEADLINE> General Dynamics Bids for Shipyard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Defense contractor General Dynamics Corp.  
on Thursday made an unsolicited cash bid for Newport News 
Shipbuilding Inc. worth $1.36 billion, though shipyard officials 
questioned whether the deal would survive an antitrust review. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer also could throw a kink into the planned $470 million  
merger announced last month between the Virginia shipyard and New 
Orleans-based Avondale Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid of $38.50 a share represents a 35 percent premium above  
Newport News' closing stock price Thursday of $28.43 3/4 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	William P. Fricks, chairman and chief executive officer of  
Newport News Shipbuilding, said the proposal ``requires a careful 
assessment of the antitrust risk and reliable assurance that it is 
unlikely to be a problem. Under present circumstances, we view this 
as requiring a finding by the Department of Defense that there is a 
reasonable likelihood of approval.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale officials said they remained strongly committed to  
their deal with the Virginia shipyard and suggested that a General 
Dynamics-Newport News deal would destroy the merger announced last 
month that would create a company capable of producing any type of 
U.S. warship. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the General Dynamics letter did not specifically ask  
Newport News to terminate its agreement with Avondale, the letter 
states that Newport News' proposed acquisition of Avondale would 
create antitrust problems in a combination of General Dynamics and 
Newport News,'' Avondale said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding officials also noted that the terms of  
the merger with Avondale do not allow consideration of another 
offer unless the shipyard's board determines the new offer is 
superior to the Avondale deal. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics, headquartered in Falls Church, Va., is one of  
the nation's leading defense contractors with 33,000 employees in 
the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics owns Electric Boat, for years Newport News  
Shipbuilding's chief rival in building submarines, as well as Bath 
Iron Works and National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. Last year, the 
company that also makes the M1 Abrams battle tank earned $364 
million, or $2.86 per share, on sales of $4.97 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding, with 18,000 employees, earned $66  
million, or $1.85 per share, on revenue of $1.86 billion last year. 
The company builds all the Navy's aircraft carriers and many of its 
submarines. It also repairs and performs maintenance on various 
types of Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale, with 6,000 employees, earned $36.9 million, or $2.82  
per share, in 1998. Annual revenue was $748.9 million. Avondale 
designs, builds and overhauls Navy surface ships as well as 
commercial vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the offer came after financial markets closed Thursday.  
Shares of Avondale rose 43 3/4 cents to $32.68 3/4 in trading on the 
Nasdaq market, while shares of General Dynamics closed at $60.06 1/4, 
up $1.93 3/4, in trading on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding was a division of Tenneco Inc. until  
December 1996, when it became an independent company.

<HEADLINE>  Pa. Man Bought Simpson's Heisman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The man who paid $255,500 for O.J. Simpson's  
Heisman Trophy was identified Thursday as a Philadelphia sheet 
metal dealer who said he wanted to impress his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom ``Juice'' Kriessman, 47, showed up at an auction house to  
collect the trophy, which was awarded to Simpson in 1968 when he 
was a star at the University of Southern California. Kriessman 
bought the prize anonymously at a court-ordered auction of Simpson 
memorabilia Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the first reasons was I wanted to impress my  
girlfriend,'' Kriessman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It represents the story of a man who rose to be a superstar  
and lost it all overnight. I bought it for everything it 
represents: The trial of the century, O.J.'s whole career, what 
happened -- you know, the tragedy that was his life. I just think in 
the future it's going to be worth a lot of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kriessman was given the same nickname as Simpson when he played  
rough touch football in his 20s in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	His girlfriend, whom Kriessman didn't identify, apparently  
wasn't the only one impressed by the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's been calling,'' he said. ``Seems everybody wants  
to touch it, everybody wants to be photographed with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kriessman is the co-owner of Triad Steel Inc, a 10-year-old  
company that buys and sells sheet metal. Partner Edward O'Brien 
said Triad has annual sales of about $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction raised $430,000 to help pay off the $33.5 million a  
jury ordered Simpson to pay when it held him liable for the 
slayings of his ex-wife and her friend Ron Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
	Kriessman also bought a couple of jerseys and a glass trophy,  
but the Heisman was the top-ticket item. 
</P>
<P>
	Kriessman, a Philadelphia Eagles fan, said he has never met  
Simpson. Asked if he would like to hear from the former Buffalo 
Bills star and perhaps pose with him and the Heisman, he said: 
``I'd have to think about it.''

<HEADLINE> Employers, IG Metall Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOEBLINGEN, Germany (AP) -- Employers and metalworkers reached a  
last-minute agreement early today on a new contract, averting a 
strike by Germany's biggest union. 
</P>
<P>
	IG Metall, whose 3.4 million membership includes workers at  
DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen, had threatened to call a strike 
vote if it did not have a new contract by midnight Wednesday. A 
compromise was reached two hours after that deadline with help from 
an independent mediator, a veteran of Chancellor Gerhard 
Schroeder's party of Social Democrats, brought in this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The wage negotiations are expected to set the tone for a second  
round of talks next week aimed at creating jobs and easing 
Germany's unemployment rate, which hit 11.5 percent last month. The 
talks, bringing together industry, union and government 
representatives, are Schroeder's key strategy for his paramount 
goal of putting Germans back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the pilot agreement, workers in the union district for  
Baden-Wuerttemberg state will receive a net 3.6 percent pay 
increase for a 14-month contract that is retroactive to Jan 1. IG 
Metall's nine other union districts are expected to receive the 
same deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder had for weeks urged the two sides to settle, arguing  
that Germany's already flagging economy could not handle a strike 
by IG Metall's enormous membership, hitting the core of German 
industry. The nation's growth forecast has worsened to just 2 
percent this year, from 2.8 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	His calls became most vigorous during the recent two weeks when  
IG Metall staged warning strikes, during which workers walked off 
jobs earlier or laid down tools for several hours during their 
shifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Disputes over wages had already rumbled through the chancellor's  
jobs talks. During the first round of talks, in December, Germany's 
largest employers group, the German Industry Association, had tried 
to make wage issues part of the discussion, a proposal the union 
and government dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	While German industrial workers are among the world's most  
highly paid, IG Metall and other unions argue that workers deserve 
a higher proportion of industry's high profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Several rounds of previous talks had been deadlocked, with the  
union seeking a 6.5 percent increase and employers offering only 
2.3 percent, plus a 0.5 percent lump payment from companies that 
could afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers had argued that a more generous increase would destroy  
jobs amid 11.5 percent unemployment and slow Germany's already 
flagging economy. But the union had said making raises even partly 
dependent on the financial health of individual companies was an 
attack on its unity and bargaining power. 
</P>
<P>
	Hans-Joachen Vogel, a veteran member of the governing Social  
Democratic Party, was brought in to help reach an agreement in 
talks seen as crucial to Germany's labor market. IG Metall is seen 
as setting the standard for wage contracts in other industries.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Insurer Buying Transamerica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dutch insurer Aegon NV is buying Transamerica  
Corp. and its landmark pyramid-shaped headquarters for $9.7 billion 
in the biggest foreign takeover of a U.S. life insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	Transamerica is the latest company to be swept up in the  
financial services industry's global merger wave. The deal, 
announced Thursday, will make Aegon the nation's third-largest life 
insurer behind Prudential Insurance Co. of America and Metropolitan 
Life Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``This aligns us with a major international player and together  
we're going to have the financial clout ... and the expertise to be 
one of the premier financial services companies as we enter the 
21st century,'' said Frank Herringer, Transamerica's chairman and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Transamerica stock soared 26.5 percent on news of the deal and  
Aegon's U.S. shares jumped 5.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While financial services firms have been merging furiously with  
foreign rivals to broaden their global reach and product offerings, 
life insurers have been slower to cross borders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life insurance is more of a national business,'' said Larry  
Altman, vice president of the insurance practice at consulting firm 
Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Aegon's purchase will rank as the second-richest life insurance  
merger -- behind American International Group Inc.'s $16.5 billion 
takeover of SunAmerica Inc. -- and industry watchers predict it will 
inspire more global deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It probably will open the door to more foreign firms coming  
in. You open the door a little bit and the rush starts,'' said 
Nancy Carini, a vice president at insurance research firm Conning &AMP; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transamerica purchase will bolster Aegon's already-strong  
U.S. insurance operations, expand the company into Canada and add a 
broader array of financial services, including commercial lending. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal also includes the famed Transamerica building, which is  
a San Francisco landmark. The building will house Aegon's U.S. 
headquarters after the deal is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Shepard, chairman and chief executive of Aegon USA, said  
some layoffs are expected among the companies' 32,000 employees, 
but did not give a specific number. The companies are aiming for 
$150 million in annual cost savings over the next three years, with 
about $40 million of that coming from combining staffs. 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of Aegon's business will be generated in the  
United States after the Transamerica deal, which comes after it 
bought U.S. insurer Providian Corp. in 1996 for $3.5 billion. 
Shepard said Aegon will continue to seek acquisitions in life 
insurance and pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Aegon will retain the better-known Transamerica name in the  
United States, and executives said cost savings from the merger 
will help the company offer more insurance products and more 
competitive rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Altman, the Booz, Allen consultant, predicted that current  
Transamerica policyholders will likely benefit from the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a policyholder, your main concern is the long-term  
stability of the company and being part of a larger enterprise in 
most cases is going to help that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aegon will pay 70 percent of the purchase price in stock and 30  
percent in cash. In addition, it will assume about $1.1 billion of 
Transamerica's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Transamerica stock shot up $15.25 to $72.87 1/2 a share on the New  
York Stock Exchange, where Aegon's U.S. shares jumped $5.12 1/2 to 
$99.87 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	After the deal is completed, Transamerica chairman Herringer  
will lead Aegon's U.S. commercial finance, leasing and real estate 
businesses. Shepard will remain head of Aegon's North American 
insurance businesses. The company also has operations in several 
Europe and Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Moderate May Fill Gingrich's Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSWELL, Ga. (AP) -- The House seat once held by the fiercely  
partisan and conservative Newt Gingrich could fall into the hands 
of a Republican some say is practically a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Former state lawmaker Johnny Isakson, 54, is the clear  
front-runner in Tuesday's special election to replace Gingrich, who 
resigned from Congress after his party's poor showing in the 
November elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The race in the staunchly GOP district in the Atlanta suburbs  
features eight candidates but no experienced Democrats -- perhaps 
because party leaders see Isakson as a pleasant change from the 
combative former House speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isakson is a type of Republican Democrats can work with,''  
said Emory University political science professor Merle Black. 
``He's not a Gingrich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, former Gov. Zell Miller, a Democrat, once needed  
someone to quell a conflict between the state's first GOP schools 
superintendent and the Democratic-appointed school board. Miller 
selected Isakson, whom he had defeated in the 1990 gubernatorial 
election, to serve as board chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in some ways a conservative Southern Democrat,'' said  
University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock. 
``If you like Sam Nunn, you could probably find something you like 
about Johnny Isakson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isakson's only opponent with name recognition is Kennesaw State  
University political science professor Christina Jeffrey. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich hired Ms. Jeffrey as House historian in 1995, then  
fired her after it was learned that she once said a Holocaust 
course should have included the Nazi point of view. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jeffrey insisted that her comments were mischaracterized.  
The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, which attacked her at 
the time, has since become an ally in her drive to reclaim her 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jeffrey has courted the conservative vote, saying Isakson's  
views are more liberal than those of most people in the district. 
At a forum this week, she accused him of supporting tax increases 
when he was in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is campaigning as a Reagan conservative, but he really has  
a record of a tax-spending liberal,'' said Tom Campbell, her 
campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Isakson dismissed the accusations, saying he voted against  
increases in sales and gas taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1996 Senate primary, Isakson touted his abortion-rights  
stand and lost in a runoff. This time, he is playing down the 
issue, stressing instead his opposition to a specific kind of 
late-term abortion and support of parental notification for minors 
wanting to end a pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the fact that voters sent me over and over again to  
the Legislature or the Senate, that's a ratification that I have a 
solid Republican background,'' Isakson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he supported Gingrich in the last election, David  
Green, 50, of Marietta said the district needs someone like 
Isakson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need someone who is more persuasive, not more demanding.  
Newt was demanding,'' Green said. ``I think instead of using a 
hammer and a blowtorch, Isakson would use a match.''

<HEADLINE> Showalter Relaxes Facial Hair Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona manager Buck Showalter is dropping  
his ban on facial hair for Diamondbacks' players. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision coincides with Randy Johnson's acquisition but  
Showalter said he's been thinking about ending the ban since 
mid-season last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed to be important to the players, but it's no big deal  
to me,'' Showalter said of the rule change. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was not about to allow Johnson to sport his goatee  
while others couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who thinks I'd have one rule for one player and another  
for everybody else doesn't know me very well,'' Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clean-shaven Andy Benes said the rule change won't affect him  
because he answers to a higher authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``If my wife says I can't have one, then it doesn't matter what  
the rules are. I won't have one,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Cincinnati Reds ended their 32-year-old  
ban on facial hair to accommodate Greg Vaughn, acquired from San 
Diego on Feb. 2.

<HEADLINE> Report Released on Police Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- A coroner's report failed to determine  
whether a 19-year-old woman was conscious when she was killed in a 
barrage of police gunfire as she sat in her car. 
</P>
<P>
	The report released Wednesday confirmed preliminary autopsy  
results that showed Tyisha Miller, 19, died from gunshot wounds to 
her head. The report said 12 bullets entered her body from the 
back, with four hitting her in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting has angered blacks and others in this city 60 miles  
east of Los Angeles, with some claiming it was racially motivated. 
Three of the officers are white and one is Hispanic; Ms. Miller was 
black. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not address whether Ms. Miller was unconscious,  
if she could have moved her head or if she suffered from epileptic 
seizures. Coroner's spokesman Mark Wasserman said those questions 
could not be answered. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, signed by Dr. Darrell J. Garbur, may help  
prosecutors decide whether charges should be filed against the 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The police, called to the scene by Ms. Miller's relatives early  
Dec. 28, said they found her sitting in her car at a gas station 
parking lot with a gun in her lap. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the officers said Ms. Miller fired at them with the  
handgun, but later said she grabbed at the gun after an officer 
broke a window. Family members and some witnesses contend Ms. 
Miller was unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives were unsatisfied with the report and demanded the  
release of the contents of a 911 call that brought police to the 
scene.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards $58.5M in Air Bag Case </HEADLINE>

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A jury on Thursday ordered DaimlerChrysler  
to pay $58.5 million in a class-action lawsuit filed by a woman 
whose hand was burned when her car's air bag inflated in an 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded $730 to each of 75,000 plaintiffs from  
Pennsylvania to buy safer air bags for Chrysler vehicles made 
between 1988 and 1990. The state court jury also awarded $3.8 
million in punitive damages to the plaintiffs.

and Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Holding DaimlerChrysler liable in this case is like holding  
the manufacturer of a bulletproof vest responsible because their 
product saved someone's life but resulted in a few bruised ribs,'' 
said Karl Lukens, an attorney for the automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The damages cover late 1988, 1989 and 1990 Chrysler vehicles  
that have driver air bags with vents, which allow the air bag to 
rapidly deflate after it inflates. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 14 of the 75,000 people who owned such vehicles had  
experiences similar to plaintiff Louise Crawley, whose 1992 
accident in a 1989 Chrysler LeBaron initiated the lawsuit, Lukens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Daniel Hensell, who treated Mrs. Crawley, testified that she  
suffered a second-degree burn on her left wrist. The burn kept her 
from working at her job at a nail salon for a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin D'Urso, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said vents to  
release the hot gas that had inflated the air bag was the source of 
the burns. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukens said none of DaimlerChrysler's tests or tests by the air  
bag maker revealed any problems with burns due to the location of 
the air bag vents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten years ago, we would have received a thank-you note from a  
customer for the air bag having saved her life,'' he said. ``Today, 
we get slapped with a multimillion-dollar verdict. That is the 
nature of our out-of-control legal system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Urso said the lawsuit was aimed at ensuring drivers can get  
safe air bags and not about trying to profit from a minor injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Crawley could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The judgment was just the latest against the company involving  
air bags. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury in New York in December ordered DaimlerChrysler  
to pay $750,000 to a family of a 5-year-old boy killed by an air 
bag during a family vacation to Puerto Rico in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the company's merger in November with Daimler-Benz AG,  
Chrysler and the parents of a 5-year-old Nashville, Tenn., girl 
killed when a minivan air bag deployed during an accident reached 
an out-of-court settlement.

<HEADLINE> New Battle Over Who Can Wage War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the United States sent a peacekeeping  
force to Bosnia, the House and Senate grudgingly agreed in a 
resolution pointedly calling it President Clinton's commitment, not 
theirs. That line may be drawn again should Clinton send troops to 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	It is part of the unending strain between the White House and  
Congress over war-making, or war-risking, powers. This one isn't 
partisan, it is institutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo mission is on hold at the moment, contingent on a  
peace deal that would be backed by a NATO force Serbs are 
resisting. There is a Saturday noon deadline for them to accept or 
face NATO air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the debate about the U.S. role didn't wait. Nor did Clinton,  
who said in a radio address on Saturday that he is prepared to send 
nearly 4,000 American troops to join about 24,000 from other NATO 
nations to enforce peace between Serbs and ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, a final decision on troops, which I will make in close  
consultation with Congress, will depend upon the parties reaching a 
strong peace agreement,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	But any consultations will be on a commitment that already has  
been made. Clinton said he believes that with an agreement, there 
should be an American role. And while promising to work with 
Congress on it, the administration isn't seeking authority to send 
forces. Like his White House predecessors, Clinton maintains that 
power is inherent in his office. 
</P>
<P>
	George Bush narrowly won congressional approval for the Persian  
Gulf War against Iraq just before it began, and said he welcomed 
the expression of support although he didn't need it to act. 
</P>
<P>
	``This administration, like previous administrations, takes the  
view that the president has broad authority as commander in chief, 
and under his authority to conduct foreign relations, to authorize 
the use of force in the national interest,'' Undersecretary of 
State Thomas Pickering told the House International Relations 
Committee a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited as precedents the operations ordered by Republican  
presidents without action by Congress. ``Previous constitutional 
violations do not justify subsequent ones,'' replied Republican 
Rep. Tom Campbell of California. 
</P>
<P>
	While that has been argued since the end of World War II, the  
decisions have been made by presidents, sometimes with use of force 
resolutions approved by Congress, more often, without. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress tried to change the balance 25 years ago with the War  
Powers Act, seeking to require congressional approval to keep U.S. 
forces in danger spots abroad. That hasn't worked; presidents can 
simply certify that the operations they order don't trigger its 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton advised congressional leaders, but did not seek consent,  
in ordering U.S. air strikes against Iraq on Dec. 17, the day the 
House was to have started debating his impeachment, which was voted 
two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor was there prior approval of an earlier peacekeeping mission  
to the Balkans, in late 1995. That was to enforce the U.S.-brokered 
peace settlement of ethnic wars in Bosnia, and at one point 
involved 22,500 Americans. There are still about 6,700 U.S. troops 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten days after Clinton approved the operation, Congress adopted  
a resolution agreeing to it, ``notwithstanding reservations'' about 
his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution, which wasn't binding, said ``the president may  
only fulfill his commitment'' for about a year, the duration he'd 
set but could not keep. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really learned a lesson in Bosnia that setting an  
artificial deadline doesn't work,'' Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright said. There would be no deadline on a peacekeeping mission 
to Kosovo, she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans who argue that Clinton's foreign policy credibility  
was shaken by the impeachment charges despite his Senate acquittal 
say the long-missed Bosnia deadline adds to their mistrust. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that wasn't quite as honest as it needed to be,'' said  
Sen. Don Nickles, the Republican whip. ``And so that is affecting 
right now his request for troops into Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it isn't a request. The next step is contingent on a peace  
deal for Kosovo, not permission from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to working with Congress in making this final  
decision,'' Clinton said. But he would make it, and he's already 
said what it would be. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bypass Drug Study Disappoints Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Genentech scientists say preliminary data  
on a drug heralded as a promising alternative to heart surgery is 
disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco-based biotechnology firm had developed a  
growth hormone it hoped would enable people with angina, or chest 
pain, to grow their own bypasses, tiny blood vessels in the heart 
that normally are substituted through grafting or angioplasty. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers hoped that genetically engineered vascular  
endothelial growth factor, or VEGF (pronounced vedge-EFF), would 
allow patients with angina who could not be treated by angioplasty 
or bypass surgery to exercise beyond their initial capability with 
less or no chest pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech had been conducting a clinical trial that was  
scheduled to be presented in two weeks at the American College of 
Cardiology conference in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Thursday, however, Dr. Susan D. Hellmann,  
Genentech's senior vice president, development and chief medical 
officer, said ``we are disappointed in the preliminary view of the 
data. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will need to more fully analyze the data with our  
investigators to attempt to understand these results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinical trial results usually are not made public outside of a  
medical conference or journal. 
</P>
<P>
	No decision has been made about whether to continue the study  
involving more than 170 people across the country, company 
spokesman Paul Laland said. The drug is in the second stage of 
development delineated by the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt it was important to get the information out quickly,''  
Laland said, insisting that the timing of the announcement was not 
unusual. He declined to elaborate on Hellman's statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Timothy D. Henry, the University of Minnesota researcher  
directing the trial, said he was perplexed by the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the first glance is disappointing, it will affect the stock  
market,'' Henry said. ``So perhaps they wanted to soften that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ``you shouldn't say anything until you've looked at all the  
data and presented'' it at the conference, he said. ``There's sort 
of been this runaway excitement in this whole area and does it (the 
preliminary results) make the building collapse? I don't think 
so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry said he had not reviewed all the data and that he would  
not necessarily call it disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1 million Americans a year undergo either bypass or  
angioplasty. A bypass involves grafting tiny pieces of blood vessel 
onto the heart to shuttle blood around blocked sections of artery. 
Angioplasty uses a tiny balloon, threaded into the heart, to 
squeeze open narrowed passages temporarily.

<HEADLINE> S.F. Abandons School Racial Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- After 15 years of using race as a basis for  
admission -- and more than four years of fighting over it in court -- 
San Francisco school officials say they can maintain diversity 
without the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The city made the abrupt about-face on Wednesday to settle a  
lawsuit by Chinese-American students who were denied admission to 
their preferred public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement would repeal the most visible feature of a  
court-supervised desegregation plan: a 45 percent limit on any 
racial or ethnic group at each school, and a 40 percent cap at 
``magnet'' schools like the city's academic flagship, Lowell High. 
</P>
<P>
	The district said it expects to give increased weight to  
economic hardship, already considered in about one-fourth of the 
competitive admissions to Lowell. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a strong correlation between race and poverty,'' said  
Associate Superintendent Anthony Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	The district had warned repeatedly in the past that a  
prohibition on the explicit use of race in assigning students would 
resegregate the schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP sued the district in 1978, saying black students were  
concentrated in the poorest schools. Five years later, U.S. 
District Judge William Orrick approved a settlement that included 
racial ceilings at each school and measures to remedy the effects 
of segregation on black and Hispanic students. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement has increased racial diversity, and there was  
little incentive for the district or the National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored People to seek an end to court 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure instead came from Chinese Americans, the largest  
ethnic group in the district. Their suit was filed in 1994 on 
behalf of one student who was denied admission to Lowell, despite 
high test scores, and two who were turned away by neighborhood 
elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this gives control of the district back to the  
population of San Francisco,'' said Daniel Girard, lawyer for the 
Chinese-American students. ``No one will be told what one of our 
plaintiffs was told, that they could not attend a school because 
there are too many Chinese.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement includes a ban on the use of race or ethnicity as  
the primary reason to assign any student to a school or program. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban would begin this fall with students entering  
kindergarten, middle and high schools, as well as students new to 
the district -- about 20,000 of the district's 62,000 students. It 
would cover all students a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	A new enrollment system that the district would design for  
2000-01 may include diversity -- racial, ethnic and economic -- among 
its goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Orrick called on all sides to agree on a new long-term  
admissions plan by Oct. 1. He gave preliminary approval to the 
settlement and scheduled a hearing on final approval for April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement comes at a time of increasing judicial hostility  
to race-based admissions. In November, a federal appeals court 
struck down race as an admissions factor at the prestigious Boston 
Latin School, a ruling the school board decided not to appeal.

<HEADLINE> General Dynamics Bids for Shipyard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A $1.36 billion cash takeover offer by  
General Dynamics for Newport News Shipbuilding has raised antitrust 
questions in the rapidly consolidating defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer also poses a threat to the planned $470 million merger  
announced last month between the Virginia shipyard and New 
Orleans-based Avondale Industries. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news release Thursday, Newport News Shipbuilding said  
General Dynamics offered $38.50 per share, a 35 percent premium 
above the shipyard's closing stock price Thursday of $28.43 3/4 on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	But William P. Fricks, the shipyard's chairman and chief  
executive officer, said the proposal ``requires a careful 
assessment of the antitrust risk and reliable assurance that it is 
unlikely to be a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Under present circumstances, we view this as requiring a  
finding by the Department of Defense that there is a reasonable 
likelihood of approval,'' Fricks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale officials said they remained strongly committed to  
their deal with Newport News Shipbuilding and suggested that a 
General Dynamics-Newport News deal would destroy the merger 
announced last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the General Dynamics letter did not specifically ask  
Newport News to terminate its agreement with Avondale, the letter 
states that Newport News' proposed acquisition of Avondale would 
create antitrust problems in a combination of General Dynamics and 
Newport News,'' Avondale said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll, deputy director of the  
Washington-based Center for Defense Information, a Pentagon 
watchdog group, said the General Dynamics offer reflects ongoing 
defense industry consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting to the point where there will be no competition  
left,'' Carroll said. ``... It seems to me that when you swallow up 
Newport News, you really take all the opportunity for true 
competition away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Nicholas D. Chabraja, chairman and CEO of Falls Church,  
Va.-based General Dynamics, defended the takeover proposal as good 
for shareholders and employees of both companies and the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the transaction will receive the required  
regulatory approvals because the combination of our companies would 
not adversely affect competition in the industry,'' Chabraja said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avondale-Newport News deal already was poised to reduce the  
Navy's pool of primary contractors for ships to three: the new 
company; General Dynamics, which owns Electric Boat, Bath Iron 
Works and National Steel and Shipbuilding Co.; and Litton 
Industries, parent of Ingalls Shipbuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	That merger, which officials had expected to complete in June,  
would create a company with estimated 1999 revenues of $2.6 
billion. The combined company would be capable of building any 
warship in the Navy's fleet, from behemoth nuclear-powered aircraft 
carriers to fast-moving amphibious landers. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics is one of the nation's leading defense  
contractors with 33,000 employees in the United States, Canada and 
the United Kingdom. Last year, it earned $364 million, or $2.86 per 
share, on sales of $4.97 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding, with 18,000 employees, earned $66  
million, or $1.85 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.86 billion 
last year. The company builds all the Navy's aircraft carriers and 
many of its submarines, and it repairs and performs maintenance on 
various types of Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale, with 6,000 employees, earned $36.9 million, or $2.82  
per diluted share, in 1998 with $748.9 million in revenues. 
Avondale designs, builds and overhauls Navy surface ships as well 
as commercial vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding was a division of Tenneco Inc. until  
December 1996, when it became an independent company.

<HEADLINE> Woman Admits LSD Jell-O Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) -- A woman who won a new trial on charges  
she murdered a 61-year-old man with LSD-laced Jell-O pleaded guilty 
to a lesser charge on Thursday and was allowed to go free. 
</P>
<P>
	Christina Martin, 49, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was  
sentenced to the eight years that she had already served for the 
earlier conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was arrested in 1991 for the death of Richard Alfredo, a  
boyfriend with a history of heart trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	She was freed in December 1998 after the state Supreme Judicial  
Court ruled her lawyer did not adequately challenge whether Alfredo 
died from LSD. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy revealed no traces of the drug, but Martin's daughter  
said at trial that she had slipped the drug into the dessert. 
Prosecutors claimed the daughter was covering for the mom. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she plotted with her mother to kill Alfredo in  
retaliation for years of sexual abuse she suffered at his hands, 
but that Martin backed out of the conspiracy.

<HEADLINE> Glaxo Wellcome Profit Down 1 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Glaxo Wellcome's profit slipped by 1 percent last  
year, the company said today. Analysts had expected a steeper loss 
for the year, which included the loss of patent protection for two 
key drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The giant drug maker posted 1998 profits of $3.00 billion, or 85  
cents per share, beating Wall Street expectations by a penny. In 
1997, Glaxo earned $3.02 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had sales of $13 billion last year, unchanged from  
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In early afternoon trading, shares of Glaxo rose $1.50 to $66 on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong sales of respiratory and nervous-system drugs helped  
offset the declines in sales of the drugs Zantac, an ulcer drug, 
and Zovirax, a herpes medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Patents for Zantac and Zovirax expired in 1997, leading to an  
$1.3 billion loss in sales to generic competitors last year, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Zantac plunged by 42 percent, while sales of Zovirax  
fell by 27 percent. The impact was especially acute in the U.S. 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the depressed results for Zantac and Zovirax, Glaxo  
Wellcome saw sales grow by an average of 17 percent in all other 
areas, King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Results were especially strong for respiratory and  
nervous-system drugs, for which sales rose by 27 percent and 32 
percent respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that they're posting these rather flat results in  
light of what is driving the growth is seen as very positive,'' 
said Michael King, an analyst for SG Securities. ``It's quite an 
achievement for them to come out looking this good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is testimony to the depth and vitality of our portfolio of  
medicines ... that we have been able to absorb the largest single 
patent expire our industry has ever seen,'' Glaxo Wellcome chairman 
Sir Richard Sykes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Partly offsetting the lost revenues were stronger sales of  
medicines for treating asthma, hay fever and the effects of 
quitting smoking. These and other respiratory drugs comprised 27 
percent of total company sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of antiviral drugs fell to 17 percent of total revenues,  
due to competition for Zovirax, while drugs for nervous system 
disorders made up 16 percent of total revenues, helped along by 
better sales of medications for depression, epilepsy and migraines, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Based largely on these results, the company expects to achieve  
double-digit earnings growth in 1999 -- a goal that King, the SG 
analyst, described as realistic. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaxo Wellcome plans to introduce five major new drugs this  
year, two for the treatment of the virus that causes AIDS and one 
each for hepatitis B, asthma and influenza, chief executive Robert 
Ingram said.

<HEADLINE> Batterymen Report to Dodgertown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Now that the business of putting the Los  
Angeles Dodgers together is more or less finished, it's finally 
time to see how the offseason investments will pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitchers and catchers reported to the team's spring training  
facility at Dodgertown on Thursday, signaling the beginning of a 
new season that has fans and officials teeming with high 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to focus on getting it done on the field,'' general  
manager Kevin Malone said. ``The assembly of the team has pretty 
much been done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the major components of the new-look Dodgers will start  
working out Friday, including free-agent right-hander Kevin Brown, 
who signed a seven-year, $105 million contract in December. 
</P>
<P>
	While his spot in the rotation is obviously secure, there are  
five other pitchers with legitimate shots at earning starting jobs: 
right-handers Chan Ho Park, Ismael Valdes, Dave Mlicki, Darren 
Dreifort, and left-hander Carlos Perez. 
</P>
<P>
	All of them will start competing for starting jobs Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's going to be a little added pressure, but I  
think everybody's up to the challenge,'' Dreifort said. ``And I 
think the changes they've made are going to help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday was a fairly mellow day. First-year manager Davey  
Johnson and members of his coaching staff hit the golf course after 
early-morning meetings, and the team's clubhouse was relatively 
quiet much of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	That will change Friday, especially with a handful of jobs still  
up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe competition is good, as long as people know what  
they're competing for,'' Malone said. ``I believe competition 
motivates championship-caliber players. Competition is healthy and 
beneficial, and we do have a surplus of players in a few areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone said he expected everyone who was supposed to be in camp  
at this point would be ready to work out on Friday, and that the 
players who had shown up already were healthy and in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the fun part,'' he said. ``I really enjoy spring  
training. It's a time just to get focused on the game itself, a 
time for the players to bond as a team, to get unified. The 
expectations don't really begin until April 5, opening day.''

<HEADLINE>  Designers Offer Star-Worthy Styles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As Fashion Week headed towards Friday's home  
stretch, Tommy Hilfiger rocked at Roseland, a dance club space 
where he staged his coed show of styles for the young and hip. 
</P>
<P>
	For fall, the $600 million wholesale fashion empire will offer  
for men and women rock 'n' roll-inspired black leather pants, 
motorcycle jackets and the sporty athletic looks that are ruling 
runways with drawstring pants, cargo pants and hooded jackets. 
</P>
<P>
	As the rock group Sugar Ray played to an audience that included  
Andie MacDowell, Lenny Kravitz and recording artist Maxwell, the 
trends of the season were tallied. A women's tan mink-hooded 
jacket, paired with a cashmere T-shirt and drawstring cargo pants, 
fairly summed up the mix of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I create for young people all over the world and people who  
think young as well,'' Hilfiger said after the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere on the Fashion Week catwalk, Halston designer Kevan  
Hall previewed winning gowns that his celebrity clientele just 
might slip into for next month's Oscars and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	The fall show Thursday, at Halston's garment district showroom,  
zeroed in on just the sort of star-studded eveningwear worthy of an 
Academy Award TV audience of about 1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gowns slit high on the leg or low on the bodice, backless or  
strapless, beaded or sheer, took their cue from architecture. Hall, 
whose customers include Minnie Driver, Halle Berry and Tracy 
Pollan, fashioned big-night-out gowns embroidered with silver metal 
bullion thread to suggest architectural beams, and with rectangular 
cutouts that resemble windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``(New Year's Eve) will be the last party of the century, so  
it's exciting to think about wearing these clothes for those 
special events,'' says Hall. ``We went all out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise prepping for the Oscars circuit, Marc Bouwer sent out a  
slew of slinky gowns Wednesday evening that might be destined for 
the red carpet. 
</P>
<P>
	Dedicating his show to the cosmos, Bouwer's second-skin,  
stretchy tube-like gowns in ``stormy blue,'' ``radiation red'' or 
``metal-dusted'' were indeed for heavenly bodies. With shapes so 
narrow, the styles will likely keep Hollywood's personal trainers 
heavily booked till the awards night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always about the body,'' says Bouwer, whose clients  
include Sigourney Weaver, Shania Twain, Toni Braxton and Charlize 
Theron. 
</P>
<P>
	Now back to the rest of the population: Thursday brought Dana  
Buchman, a $200 million wholesale company that caters to what the 
fashion industry calls real women. They're the sort who favor 
comfortable, figure-friendly classics with a taste of the trends, 
and the new collection delivers just that. 
</P>
<P>
	With a nod to fall's looks that promise to be popular, the  
lineup includes silver metallic sweater sets, mohair sweaters with 
silk taffeta ball skirts, fake-fur cuffs and collars, and 
unconstructed cashmere jackets -- all quietly stylish. 
</P>
<P>
	Another time, another place. Anna Sui, designer of vivacious  
street fashion, saluted folk music Wednesday with an exuberant line 
of patchworks, peasant blouses and ponchos straight from the hippie 
'60s. 
</P>
<P>
	A black-and-white documentary showed a fresh-faced Bob Dylan and  
Judy Collins, as Sui showed her reinvented trappings of the 
Woodstock generation, from funky smock dresses to bell sleeves and 
skirts dotted with little mirrors. The runway rocked with 
guitar-case-toting models, including young pop musician Rufus 
Wainwright. 
</P>
<P>
	While counterculture designer clothes may qualify as an  
oxymoron, and the styles were likely born decades before her 
models, Sui updated the line with a wink at the season's trends, 
including boiled wool, mohair and polar fleece. The line just might 
appeal to her hip customers, among whom are Cher, Liv Tyler and 
Anne Heche. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to epitomize what I consider avant garde and  
bohemian,'' says Sui, who did her homework by culling flea markets, 
listening to dusty old records and watching a black power 
documentary.

<HEADLINE> Nike Boosts Ad Budget 46 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Nike plans to boost its fiscal 2000 ad  
budget by nearly 46 percent, hoping that a new wave of ads could 
rejuvenate its sales, which have suffered along with the entire 
athletic shoe and apparel industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike slashed its 1999 ad budget to $240 million, compared to  
$314 million in fiscal 1998, as part of a companywide cost-cutting 
move that included layoffs, closing offices and reducing athlete 
endorsement spending. 
</P>
<P>
	In 2000, the company will spend $350 million on advertising,  
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street praised the move, which pared Nike's annual expenses  
from $2.8 billion in fiscal 1998 to $2.4 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nike officials now say the advertising cuts may have been a  
mistake, reducing the company's visibility when a high profile was 
more important than ever. The company has struggled in the past 
year amid the Asian financial crisis, the National Basketball 
Association strike, and fashion trends that turned young customers 
away from sports sneakers and toward hiking boots and other casual 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	In its most recent fiscal quarter, Nike earned $68.9 million, or  
24 cents per diluted share, compared to $141.1 million or 48 cents 
per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Sagging domestic sales 
caused overall revenue to drop 15 percent, to $1.91 billion, 
compared to $2.26 billion in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending increase is good news for Nike's two ad agencies,  
Portland-based Wieden &AMP; Kennedy and Goodby Silverstein &AMP; Partners. 
Wieden &AMP; Kennedy laid off 37 employees last summer, a move it 
blamed on lower spending by Nike, its largest client.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T-TCI Merger Wins FCC Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T's planned merger with cable giant TCI,  
which could dramatically change how people get local phone and 
Internet services, has won federal regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission, concluding Wednesday that  
the merger was likely to benefit consumers, didn't impose any major 
conditions on the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Local phone competition has focused mostly on high-volume  
business customers, but the merger holds the promise of providing 
residential customers a new choice for local service. It also 
offers consumers one-stop shopping for local calling, Internet 
access and long-distance service -- all over their cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am optimistic because the combined resources of AT&AMP;T and TCI  
surely will generate a very substantial effort to expand the 
choices now available to residential phone subscribers,'' said FCC 
Chairman Bill Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC did not force AT&AMP;T and Tele-Communications Inc. to  
provide other companies with access to TCI's high-speed cable TV 
lines. Consumer groups, America Online and others had pressed the 
agency to require AT&AMP;T to give other companies access to those 
lines to offer competing Internet or phone services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the early stage of deployment of cable's high-speed  
Internet access services, it would be imprudent to act now,'' 
Kennard said. The commission concluded that the merger would not 
harm competition for Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, meanwhile, will continue to lobby regulators and lawmakers  
on Capitol Hill to provide rival companies with access to TCI's 
high-speed lines as well as those controlled by other cable 
companies, said AOL spokeswoman Kathy McKiernan. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the merger, AT&AMP;T will control TCI's stake in AtHome  
Corp., a leading provider of high-speed Internet access. Consumer 
groups have said AT&AMP;T could charge extra if customers got Internet 
service over the merged companies' lines and wanted another 
Internet service provider, such as AOL. But the commission did not 
set any conditions on that part of the deal, either. 
</P>
<P>
	A pleased AT&AMP;T expects to close the merger, valued at nearly $32  
billion when it was announced last year, by March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers Union's  
Washington office, insisted that ``most consumers won't see 
benefits because the merged company is likely to serve only 
high-end customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said, however, he has a commitment from AT&AMP;T to ``offer  
service uniformly in all neighborhoods in every city it serves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kimmelman also is worried that the merged company might raise  
cable TV rates to help finance local phone and other new ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is the nation's largest telecommunications company. TCI is  
the nation's second-largest cable TV company, with lines that reach 
one-third of U.S. homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of TCI's lines have been upgraded to permit cable TV  
customers to connect their computers to the Internet at speeds much 
faster than regular telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, AT&AMP;T intends to make TCI's lines capable of  
providing customers with local phone service, too. AT&AMP;T has a 
separate agreement with cable company Time Warner to provide local 
phone service over its high-speed cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable agreements would give AT&AMP;T a way to get into homes  
without having to rely on phone lines controlled by the regional 
Bell companies, which dominate the local phone market.

<HEADLINE>  Inmate Testifies in Dragging Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Dragging death defendant John William King  
discussed abducting a black man and killing him as part of an 
initiation rite for his racist gang, a former fellow inmate 
testified today. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get in you have to get a blood tie,'' William Hoover, a  
convicted robber, said of the talks he and King had in prison. 
``You send somebody on a mission to stab somebody or do something. 
</P>
<P>
	``To help new recruits get initiated, take somebody out and kill  
them. You have to spill blood to get in and give blood to get out, 
I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, is accused of murdering a black man, James Byrd Jr.,  
last June by chaining him to the back of a pickup truck and 
dragging him for nearly three miles along a bumpy asphalt road, 
dismembering his body. If convicted, King could face the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Guy James Gray has said he believes the Byrd slaying  
was intended as a stunt to draw attention to a new white 
supremacist group King was forming in Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other white men, Lawrence Brewer, 31, and Shawn Berry, 23,  
also are charged and are to be tried later. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoover, from Springfield, Mo., like King is heavily tattooed and  
belonged to a white supremacist prison gang, the Aryan Brotherhood. 
Hoover is now a college student in Springfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are portraying King as so hateful he proudly adorned  
his body with dozens of bold and intricate racist tattoos. He 
obtained most of them while he was in prison. One shows a baby 
Jesus with horns coming from his head, and another shows a black 
man hanging from a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously you can't commit a crime this heinous unless you've  
got a lot of hate and anger in your heart,'' Gray said Wednesday 
after introducing photo of King's tattoos into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	But defense attorneys tried today to show the tattoos were  
intended as protection devices to help King survive in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoover testified they were intended to show solidarity with  
other white inmates and help ward off attacks from black inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination, an earlier witness, Jasper police  
officer Rich Ford, said the symbols could be interpreted in 
different ways, but insisted they were meant to express values and 
beliefs. But he also acknowledged that the tattoos could be meant 
to intimidate other inmates who might prey on a 5-foot-7 white man 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the eye of the beholder,'' defense attorney Brack  
Jones told him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, sir,'' Ford replied.

<HEADLINE>  Roger Clemens Traded to Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Roger Clemens always thought he'd look good  
in pinstripes. He just couldn't bring himself to wear them when he 
got his first chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Two seasons after rejecting George Steinbrenner's plea to sign  
with the New York Yankees as a free agent, Rocket is getting 
another opportunity to play for the Boss. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, trying to improve on perfection, traded for the  
five-time Cy Young Award winner and said goodbye Thursday to David 
Wells and two other players from the team that won 125 games and 
the World Series last year. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Yankees weren't eager to tinker with success, Clemens  
is considered well worth the risk after leading the AL in wins, ERA 
and strikeouts the past two seasons with the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `I finally got you,''' the 36-year-old right-hander  
said, relating a telephone conversation he had with Steinbrenner 
after the deal was finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel real fortunate that they had a championship team and  
still had an interest in me,'' Clemens said. ``I feel pretty 
fortunate to get a second chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Wells, he left the Yankees' first day of spring training  
in tears after speaking with Steinbrenner and manager Joe Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little emotional right now,'' Wells said. ``Give me a  
couple days. It's a little tough right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York and Toronto actually completed the deal late Wednesday  
night, but delayed the announcement to tell Wells in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took it like a real man. He took it better than I took  
it,'' Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boomer,'' as the 35-year-old left-hander is known throughout  
the Bronx and beyond, has been the toast of New York since pitching 
a perfect game against Minnesota at Yankee Stadium on May 17. He's 
coming off the best season of his career, 18-4 with a 3.49 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Perfection was also Mr. Personality, as far as Yankee fans  
were concerned. They loved his loud mouth and his loud music -- 
Metallica was a favorite. They loved his beer belly and the way he 
loves The Babe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way you ever get rid of a World Series hero is to get  
Roger Clemens, who's the best pitcher in baseball,'' Yankees 
pitcher David Cone said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about Boomer, he almost became a cult hero  
overnight. Last year with the perfect game, he made his mark in 
Yankees history. He can be proud of that. He won't be forgotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens' resume is impressive -- more Cy Youngs than any player  
in baseball history, second on the career ERA title list with six, 
fourth on the career strikeout list with 3,153 -- but doesn't 
include the ultimate team accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to give fellows a chance who deserve a chance for a  
World Series ring,'' Steinbrenner said. ``Hopefully we can get back 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens is owed $16.1 million during the final two years of his  
contract and has the right to demand a trade following this 
season's World Series. However, he doesn't expect that to become an 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	While stressing that he appreciates a second chance to join New  
York, Clemens didn't second-guess choosing Toronto over the Yankees 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It worked out for me,'' he said. ``It didn't work out for the  
team. We didn't win. That's the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a 233-124 career record, Clemens went 20-6 last season  
while leading the AL in ERA (2.65), strikeouts (271) and tying for 
the lead in wins. He led in all three categories in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he won consecutive Cy Young Awards with the Blue Jays, he  
wanted out after the team's Belgium owner, Interbrew SA, decided 
not to compete with baseball's big spenders this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston and Texas were still bidding for Clemens this week, but  
the deal with the Yankees came together after Toronto dropped its 
insistence on obtaining 21-year-old shortstop Alfonso Soriano. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a horse, and he's now our horse,'' New York general  
manager Brian Cashman said. ``We're betting on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees set an AL record for wins last year, going 114-48 in  
the regular season. New York then went 11-2 in the postseason, 
including a Series sweep of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous thing -- hopefully to get back again. Not  
that we wouldn't have that chance anyway. But it might improve our 
chances,'' Steinbrenner said.

	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The New York Yankees started spring training  
with a bang today -- putting Roger Clemens in pinstripes and sending 
Mr. Perfection, David Wells, to Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time Cy Young Award winner was traded to the World  
Series champions for Wells, reliever Graeme Lloyd and infielder 
Homer Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens agreed to the deal, but the 36-year-old right-hander did  
not get an extension to his contract, which has two years to run 
and calls for him to be paid $16.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to catch my breath after last night's and this  
morning's events,'' Clemens said from Houston during a telephone 
conference call. ``They are the champions. I just want to slide in 
the side door and go to work with these guys and hopefully fit 
right in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trade stunned the Yankees, coming off a record-setting  
125-win season and barely settled into Legends Field for their 
7 1/2-week spring stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little emotional right now,'' Wells said after meeting  
with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner at the team's training 
complex. ``Give me a couple days. It's a little tough right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, a quirky left-hander known as ``Boomer,'' was the toast  
of New York after pitching a perfect game against the Minnesota 
Twins on May 17. While he clashed with Steinbrenner and manager Joe 
Torre at times in 1997, he reached a peace with them last year and 
became one of the team's most effective pitchers with an 18-4 
record and a 3.49 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some shock in that room right now,'' Torre said of his  
clubhouse. ``It's something you have to get used to. That is what 
the game is all about. There are going to be changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going into today, New York had retained 24 of the 25 players who  
helped win its second Series title in three seasons, letting go 
only of outfielder Tim Raines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm shocked,'' Lloyd said. ``To break up the team -- it's a  
shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, coming off consecutive Cy Youngs, will report to the  
Yankees on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roger Clemens is a non-stop Hall of Famer,'' Torre said. ``The  
last two years, what he's done, it's incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens has always been one of Steinbrenner's favorite players,  
and is the only five-time Cy Young winner in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met my match in a guy who wants to win,'' Clemens said after  
speaking with The Boss. ``This guy, he settles for nothing less. I 
enjoy that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Rocket'' exercised a clause in a side agreement between  
himself and the Blue Jays, demanded a trade Nov. 27, wanting to be 
dealt either to a contender or closer to his home in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who has never played on a World Series champion,  
withdrew the demand Dec. 22, criticizing Houston Astros general 
manager Gerry Hunsicker for blasting his request for a $27.4 
million, one-year contract extension, which would have left the 
Astros owing him $43.5 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas, Cleveland and Houston also expressed interest in Clemens,  
who went 20-6 last season, leading the American League in ERA 
(2.65) and strikeouts (271), and tying for the lead in wins. His 
career record is 233-124 in 15 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto had sought several young prospects from teams when it  
shopped Clemens during December's winter meetings in Nashville, 
Tenn., but the Yankees were able to hold onto some of the players 
the Blue Jays coveted most: outfielder Ricky Ledee and pitcher 
Ramiro Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Blue Jays finally lowered their demands, and  
the Yankees couldn't say no. While Clemens has the right to demand 
a trade following the World Series, he is expected to work out an 
extension with Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had an offer yesterday from them to us that made my knees  
buckle,'' New York general manager Brian Cashman said. ``It's tough 
when you have a player the caliber of Roger Clemens staring you in 
the face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the final decision was difficult. New York set an AL  
record for wins last year, going 114-48 in the regular season. The 
Yankees then went 11-2 in the postseason, including a Series sweep 
of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an easy choice to tinker with the success we had in  
1998,'' Cashman said, adding, ``We're a proactive organization and 
constantly looking to improve things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, a 35-year-old left-hander known as much for his fondness  
for heavy metal as his pitching, returns to his first major league 
team. He was with the Blue Jays from 1987-92 before he was released 
and moved on to Detroit, Cincinnati, Baltimore and the Yankees -- 
who signed him only after losing to Toronto in the bidding for 
Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells has a 124-84 career record and a 3.96 ERA.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's matured somewhat since he was with us the last  
time,'' Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash said in Dunedin. ``His 
experiences in other situations have made him a better pitcher. 
He's a smarter pitcher now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston and Texas also talked with Toronto this week.  
</P>
<P>
	``This one did the most for us in terms of what we wanted to  
accomplish,'' Ash said. ``We put three players on our club for one. 
even though the one is premium guy. The other other deals were more 
future-orientated deals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd, a 31-year-old left-hander from Australia, was 3-0 with a  
1.67 ERA in 50 relief appearances last year, combining with Mike 
Stanton, Jeff Nelson and Ramiro Mendoza to form perhaps the best 
middle relief corps in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, a 26-year-old who plays primarily at second base, was  
voted the top Yankees rookie in spring training last year. He hit 
.380 in 71 at-bats for the Yankees but was considered expendable 
because New York has Chuck Knoblauch.

<HEADLINE> Honda's Third-Quarter Profits Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Third-quarter profits at Honda Motor Co. grew  
thanks to the weaker yen and cost-cutting measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda, one of Japan's top automakers, said Thursday its net  
profit rose 15.9 percent in the third quarter ended Dec. 31 
compared with a year ago, to 75.59 billion yen ($635 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Sales, however, slipped 3.9 percent to 1.495 trillion yen ($12.6  
billion). Although sales of automobiles in North America continued 
to rise, sales of autos, as well as motorcycles, in 
recession-stricken Japan and Asia fell, dragging down overall 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Satoshi Aoki, managing director at Honda, said his company will  
likely meet its profit forecasts for the full fiscal year ending 
March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added that overall sales are likely to fall short of the  
company's forecast by about 100 billion yen ($840 million) because 
of the yen's recent surge against the dollar and continued sluggish 
sales in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Honda said it was forecasting a net profit of 280  
billion yen ($2.35 billion) and sales of 6.4 trillion yen ($53.8 
billion) for the full fiscal year, which ends in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda said it expects the dollar to average 115 yen in the  
fourth quarter, compared with 125 yen a year ago. For the full 
fiscal year, the automaker expects the dollar to average 127 yen 
compared with 121 yen a year ago.

<HEADLINE>  Roger Clemens Traded to Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Roger Clemens always thought he'd look good  
in pinstripes. He just couldn't bring himself to wear them when he 
got his first chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Two seasons after rejecting George Steinbrenner's plea to sign  
with the New York Yankees as a free agent, Rocket is getting 
another opportunity to play for the Boss. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, trying to improve on perfection, traded for the  
five-time Cy Young Award winner and said goodbye Thursday to David 
Wells and two other players from the team that won 125 games and 
the World Series last year. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Yankees weren't eager to tinker with success, Clemens  
is considered well worth the risk after leading the AL in wins, ERA 
and strikeouts the past two seasons with the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `I finally got you,''' the 36-year-old right-hander  
said, relating a telephone conversation he had with Steinbrenner 
after the deal was finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel real fortunate that they had a championship team and  
still had an interest in me,'' Clemens said. ``I feel pretty 
fortunate to get a second chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Wells, he left the Yankees' first day of spring training  
in tears after speaking with Steinbrenner and manager Joe Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little emotional right now,'' Wells said. ``Give me a  
couple days. It's a little tough right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York and Toronto actually completed the deal late Wednesday  
night, but delayed the announcement to tell Wells in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took it like a real man. He took it better than I took  
it,'' Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boomer,'' as the 35-year-old left-hander is known throughout  
the Bronx and beyond, has been the toast of New York since pitching 
a perfect game against Minnesota at Yankee Stadium on May 17. He's 
coming off the best season of his career, 18-4 with a 3.49 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Perfection was also Mr. Personality, as far as Yankee fans  
were concerned. They loved his loud mouth and his loud music -- 
Metallica was a favorite. They loved his beer belly and the way he 
loves The Babe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way you ever get rid of a World Series hero is to get  
Roger Clemens, who's the best pitcher in baseball,'' Yankees 
pitcher David Cone said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about Boomer, he almost became a cult hero  
overnight. Last year with the perfect game, he made his mark in 
Yankees history. He can be proud of that. He won't be forgotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens' resume is impressive -- more Cy Youngs than any player  
in baseball history, second on the career ERA title list with six, 
fourth on the career strikeout list with 3,153 -- but doesn't 
include the ultimate team accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to give fellows a chance who deserve a chance for a  
World Series ring,'' Steinbrenner said. ``Hopefully we can get back 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens is owed $16.1 million during the final two years of his  
contract and has the right to demand a trade following this 
season's World Series. However, he doesn't expect that to become an 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	While stressing that he appreciates a second chance to join New  
York, Clemens didn't second-guess choosing Toronto over the Yankees 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It worked out for me,'' he said. ``It didn't work out for the  
team. We didn't win. That's the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a 233-124 career record, Clemens went 20-6 last season  
while leading the AL in ERA (2.65), strikeouts (271) and tying for 
the lead in wins. He led in all three categories in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he won consecutive Cy Young Awards with the Blue Jays, he  
wanted out after the team's Belgium owner, Interbrew SA, decided 
not to compete with baseball's big spenders this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston and Texas were still bidding for Clemens this week, but  
the deal with the Yankees came together after Toronto dropped its 
insistence on obtaining 21-year-old shortstop Alfonso Soriano. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a horse, and he's now our horse,'' New York general  
manager Brian Cashman said. ``We're betting on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees set an AL record for wins last year, going 114-48 in  
the regular season. New York then went 11-2 in the postseason, 
including a Series sweep of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous thing -- hopefully to get back again. Not  
that we wouldn't have that chance anyway. But it might improve our 
chances,'' Steinbrenner said.

<HEADLINE>  Inmate Testifies in Dragging Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Dragging death defendant John William King  
discussed abducting a black man and killing him as part of an 
initiation rite for his racist gang, a former fellow inmate 
testified today. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get in you have to get a blood tie,'' William Hoover, a  
convicted robber, said of the talks he and King had in prison. 
``You send somebody on a mission to stab somebody or do something. 
</P>
<P>
	``To help new recruits get initiated, take somebody out and kill  
them. You have to spill blood to get in and give blood to get out, 
I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, is accused of murdering a black man, James Byrd Jr.,  
last June by chaining him to the back of a pickup truck and 
dragging him for nearly three miles along a bumpy asphalt road, 
dismembering his body. If convicted, King could face the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Guy James Gray has said he believes the Byrd slaying  
was intended as a stunt to draw attention to a new white 
supremacist group King was forming in Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other white men, Lawrence Brewer, 31, and Shawn Berry, 23,  
also are charged and are to be tried later. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoover, from Springfield, Mo., like King is heavily tattooed and  
belonged to a white supremacist prison gang, the Aryan Brotherhood. 
Hoover is now a college student in Springfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are portraying King as so hateful he proudly adorned  
his body with dozens of bold and intricate racist tattoos. He 
obtained most of them while he was in prison. One shows a baby 
Jesus with horns coming from his head, and another shows a black 
man hanging from a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously you can't commit a crime this heinous unless you've  
got a lot of hate and anger in your heart,'' Gray said Wednesday 
after introducing photo of King's tattoos into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	But defense attorneys tried today to show the tattoos were  
intended as protection devices to help King survive in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoover testified they were intended to show solidarity with  
other white inmates and help ward off attacks from black inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination, an earlier witness, Jasper police  
officer Rich Ford, said the symbols could be interpreted in 
different ways, but insisted they were meant to express values and 
beliefs. But he also acknowledged that the tattoos could be meant 
to intimidate other inmates who might prey on a 5-foot-7 white man 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the eye of the beholder,'' defense attorney Brack  
Jones told him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, sir,'' Ford replied.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Cinemas Seek Salvation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- A night at the movies in Myanmar isn't  
exactly escapism. 
</P>
<P>
	Rats and roaches compete for bits of food under the wooden  
seats, scuttling over the sandaled feet of moviegoers too intent on 
making out blurry images on the screen to pay them much mind. 
</P>
<P>
	The smell of urine from the lavatories wafts into the theater,  
but none of overhead fans that could clear the hot, sticky air work 
-- or if they do, they're shut off to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers crunching potato chips and sunflower seeds, who would be  
merely annoying in a better cinema, make it impossible to 
understand the dialogue playing over the antique sound system. 
</P>
<P>
	The films? A typical one, a 7-year-old romance titled ``Love in  
a New Style,'' with local stars Kyaw Thu and Soe Myat Thuzar, had a 
happy ending that almost never arrived when the much-screened copy 
jammed three times in the 40-year-old projector. 
</P>
<P>
	Cinemas in Myanmar, also known as Burma, were taken over by the  
military government in 1968 and run under then-fashionable 
socialist policies by municipal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowadays, the theaters that aren't in ruins are gross dumps. But  
a handful have been transferred into private hands and have 
renovated, giving crowds a good show in clean, comfortable 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what, there's nothing like watching a good movie at  
a theater on a big screen,'' said film buff Khin Marlar, 25, 
emerging from a rundown theater on the capital's outskirts. ``But 
it will be good if more cinema halls are transferred to 
entrepreneurs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's happening as the present military government, which has  
abandoned socialism and gradually opened the economy over the past 
decade, tries to get out of the movie business. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities recently announced that 57 cinemas, mostly on the  
outskirts of Yangon or in the provinces, would be opened to bidding 
by private entrepreneurs, with opening bids sought between $6,000 
and $28,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Three decades ago, Myanmar's 400 movie theaters were popular  
public places to seek diversion. The better ones in Yangon were 
cooled by air-conditioning -- a rarity in much of Southeast Asia at 
the time -- and well-maintained with fashionable sofa settees. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, besides the ravages of nationalization, surviving cinemas  
suffer from problems known to theaters everywhere -- competition 
from television, and the popularity of videos. 
</P>
<P>
	Myanmar filmmakers used to produce around 80 movies a year. Now,  
they turn out about a dozen. One problem is the shortage of foreign 
currency needed to purchase expensive imported film stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The shortage of foreign exchange also makes it impossible for  
the government to import foreign movies from the United States, 
Hong Kong and even India. Most cinemas still in business are 
running at a loss, almost empty. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, cinemas leased to private firms are thriving.  
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the popularity of videos, movies remain the best mode  
of entertainment,'' declared Zaw Min, the head of Mingalar Co., 
currently operating three cinemas in Yangon and two in Mandalay. 
</P>
<P>
	Before entering the business, Zaw Min visited cinemas in  
neighboring countries to get a grasp of the modern entertainment 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The condition of the state-owned cinema halls was miserable,''  
said Zaw Min, sipping Chinese tea. ``Hair-stuffed seats were 
irreparably damaged, projectors were too old, paint was peeling off 
and the ceilings were riddled with termite holes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took up to six months to renovate the old cinemas. He  
imported new projectors from Hong Kong and Singapore, installed 
Dolby sound and modern lighting, and set up a generator to help the 
show go on during frequent municipal power cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's got queues of customers stretching into the streets,  
though the ticket prices -- equivalent to about 25 cents to 50 cents 
-- are much higher than the 7 cents to 15 cents at the old cinemas. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of low-budget local fare, they can see ``Titanic'' or  
James Bond films or the latest Jackie Chan offering. 
</P>
<P>
	``Local movies with popular actors and actresses are still a big  
market,'' Zaw Min said. ``People of different age groups watch 
Myanmar films, while audiences of Western films are mostly from the 
educated classes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Zaw Min is not showing much interest in the new  
privatization, which focuses mostly on Yangon's outskirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the capital, Zaw Min says, his prices are too high and  
cinemas just can't compete with video parlors, where customers pay 
as little as 1.5 cents for a spot on a bench to watch a video, 
often in someone's home. 
</P>
<P>
	Aung Min, a manual laborer who could expect to bring home 55  
cents on a good day, says there's no contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd never go to a cinema,'' Aung Min said. ``There's a video  
parlor right near my home, and it's a lot better value.''

<HEADLINE> Teen in Court for Impregnating Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. (AP) -- A teen-ager who impregnated his  
sister when she was 12 was sentenced to six months in jail and six 
months on an electronic tether Thursday. He could also be deported 
to his native India. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl's immigrant family had to go to court last year to win  
the right to take her to Kansas for a late-term abortion. Late-term 
abortions are illegal in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 18-year-old brother, who was 17 when the girl got pregnant,  
pleaded guilty in December to criminal sexual conduct. He could 
have gotten two years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service said it will deport  
him when he finishes his jail term. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Roland Olzark and prosecutor Steven Kaplan said the  
parents bear significant responsibility for putting their son and 
daughter in the same small bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see a young man with an excellent future, absent this  
offense,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager was also given three years of probation.  
</P>
<P>
	Immigration law requires the deportation of non-citizens who  
commit what the government considers ``aggravated felonies,'' said 
INS District Director Carol Jenifer in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is not eligible to remain in this country,'' Ms. Jenifer  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents, factory workers who came to the United States 18  
months ago, said they will also leave the country if their son is 
deported.

<HEADLINE>  Steinbrenner Did Love David Wells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Boss is not crazy, just fickle.  
</P>
<P>
	George Steinbrenner really did love David Wells. It's just that  
he loved Roger Clemens more. And the New York Yankees most of all. 
</P>
<P>
	There is not another owner in sports self-assured enough to do  
what Steinbrenner did. It was like sitting at a blackjack table 
holding 18 and saying ``hit me'' when the cards come around. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner already had the best team in baseball. Then he  
found a way to make them just a little bit better. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, most owners would pause and ask themselves: How  
much better, really, does a team that won 125 games and swept the 
World Series have to be? 
</P>
<P>
	The book says stay pat. Instead, George answered the way he  
always has: Hit me. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, not everybody was as comfortable with the decision as  
the decision-maker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give me a couple of days,'' Wells said. ``It's a little tough  
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Small wonder. In the span of a Thursday morning meeting when  
Steinbrenner told Wells in person that the deal had been made, the 
wacky left-hander went from being the toast of New York to just 
toast. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre couldn't have felt much better. Getting  
Clemens, a five-time Cy Young award-winner, can hardly be called a 
consolation prize. But replacing Wells in the clubhouse might turn 
out to be tougher than it is on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some shock in that room right now,'' Torre said with a  
nod toward the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	But he could have been talking about his office, too. For all  
the attention that's focused on Wells, Torre knows it won't be easy 
replacing the other two ex-Yankees on their way to Toronto: Graeme 
Lloyd, who developed into a solid left-handed reliever; and Homer 
Bush, a backup infielder whose speed and defense made him a 
valuable late-inning replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something you have to get used to,'' Torre added. ``That  
is what the game is all about. There are going to be changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But this is a change almost no one saw coming.  
</P>
<P>
	Wells, after all, seemed so much like George's kind of guy. He  
pitched a perfect game, won 18 in all and never, ever ducked 
responsibility. Only last October, before one of the biggest games 
of the postseason, the two sat side-by-side in the clubhouse an 
hour before the game, bonding while the music of Metallica pounded 
in the background. 
</P>
<P>
	They might have seemed like an unlikely pair at that moment, the  
owner in his blazer and white turtleneck, the, potbellied, goateed 
pitcher in a cutoff T-shirt. But what they had in common was more 
important -- a desire to bring New York back a world championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, Steinbrenner felt the same way about Clemens.  
So much so that when Clemens went on the free-agent market, the 
owner made a trip to Texas to convince him to move to New York. To 
prove his sincerity, Steinbrenner even lifted weights with the 
Rocket in his home gym. They didn't come to terms then, but clearly 
were impressed with each other's work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that they're partners, they had better make sure the rest of  
New York feels the same way when next fall rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be a lot of bars going out of business in New  
York,'' predicted David Cone, who often followed Wells in the 
pitching rotation and in clubhouse antics. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won't be forgotten. I'm sure there are mixed emotions among  
the fans. As soon as Rocket throws his first 15-strikeout night at 
Yankee Stadium people will be oohing and wowing, saying what a 
catch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be nice if things work out that way. Success too often  
is a sedative for championship teams. The Florida Marlins won one 
championship, then fired just about everybody who made it happen. 
The Chicago Bulls won six in the NBA during the past decade, then 
simply let everybody walk away. 
</P>
<P>
	George may be meddling, but give him credit for this much: At  
least he's trying.

<HEADLINE>  Steinbrenner Did Love David Wells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Boss is not crazy, just fickle.  
</P>
<P>
	George Steinbrenner really did love David Wells. It's just that  
he loved Roger Clemens more. And the New York Yankees most of all. 
</P>
<P>
	There is not another owner in sports self-assured enough to do  
what Steinbrenner did. It was like sitting at a blackjack table 
holding 18 and saying ``hit me'' when the cards come around. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner already had the best team in baseball. Then he  
found a way to make them just a little bit better. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, most owners would pause and ask themselves: How  
much better, really, does a team that won 125 games and swept the 
World Series have to be? 
</P>
<P>
	The book says stay pat. Instead, George answered the way he  
always has: Hit me. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, not everybody was as comfortable with the decision as  
the decision-maker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give me a couple of days,'' Wells said. ``It's a little tough  
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Small wonder. In the span of a Thursday morning meeting when  
Steinbrenner told Wells in person that the deal had been made, the 
wacky left-hander went from being the toast of New York to just 
toast. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre couldn't have felt much better. Getting  
Clemens, a five-time Cy Young award-winner, can hardly be called a 
consolation prize. But replacing Wells in the clubhouse might turn 
out to be tougher than it is on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some shock in that room right now,'' Torre said with a  
nod toward the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	But he could have been talking about his office, too. For all  
the attention that's focused on Wells, Torre knows it won't be easy 
replacing the other two ex-Yankees on their way to Toronto: Graeme 
Lloyd, who developed into a solid left-handed reliever; and Homer 
Bush, a backup infielder whose speed and defense made him a 
valuable late-inning replacement.

<HEADLINE> Feds Investigate New Jersey Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The Justice Department is investigating New  
Jersey's state police force to determine whether troopers regularly 
violate the civil rights of minority motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are trying to find out if there is ``a pattern or  
practice of misconduct,'' Christine DiBartolo, a spokeswoman for 
the department's Civil Rights Division, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	DiBartolo wouldn't say what the investigation was about, but a  
law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity told 
The Associated Press the probe focused on whether troopers violated 
minorities' rights on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	DiBartolo said the investigation predates a shooting on the New  
Jersey Turnpike last spring that prompted allegations among black 
leaders that troopers routinely stop motorists based on race. 
</P>
<P>
	Three minority men were wounded April 23, 1998, after two white  
troopers pulled over their van for speeding. The troopers said they 
fired because the van backed toward them. 
</P>
<P>
	State police deny making stops based on race, but there has been  
a growing furor over allegations that they do. 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney General Peter Verniero appointed a review team  
last week to examine racial profiling after documents were made 
public showing that 75 percent of motorists arrested on the 
turnpike over a two-month period in 1997 were minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights groups this week demanded the ouster of state  
police Superintendent Col. Carl Williams, who said he had no 
intention of resigning and was offended by the demand. Gov. 
Christine Whitman stood by him and said there is no ``policy of 
racial profiling in this state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allegations that state police target minorities also have come  
from the department's own ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	A trooper's federal lawsuit filed this month accuses state  
police of ordering him to use racial profiling in deciding which 
drivers to pull over, to boost drug arrest statistics.

<HEADLINE> Teen Accused of Impregnating Sister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. (AP) -- An immigrant teen-ager who pleaded  
guilty to having sex with his 12-year-old sister has been sentenced 
to six months in jail and faces deportation to his native India. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members went to court last year to win the right to take  
the girl to Kansas for a late-term abortion, which is illegal in 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 18-year-old brother, who was 17 when the girl got pregnant,  
pleaded guilty in December to criminal sexual conduct. He could 
have gotten two years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service said it will deport  
him when he finishes his jail term. The parents, factory workers 
who came to the United States 18 months ago, said they will leave 
the country if he is deported. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Roland Olzark and prosecutor Steven Kaplan said the  
parents bear significant responsibility for putting their son and 
daughter in the same small bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see a young man with an excellent future, absent this  
offense,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl and parents had opposed prosecution and asked that he  
not be jailed. All three were in court Thursday but did not speak. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager, who must report to jail within a week of his  
graduation from high school in June, was also given three years of 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration law requires the deportation of non-citizens who  
commit what the government considers ``aggravated felonies,'' said 
INS District Director Carol Jenifer in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is not eligible to remain in this country,'' Ms. Jenifer  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Arthur Garton said kicking his client out of  
the country would punish his entire family. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there ever was one, this is a case that strongly merits  
mitigation, rather than deportation,'' Garton said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Meet With NAACP Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is a featured guest at the  
NAACP's 90th annual meeting, which unlike in recent years will hear 
good news about the organization's finances. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP, the nation's largest and oldest civil rights group,  
was playing host to Clinton at a special reception tonight before 
the main meeting Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Through his creation of the race advisory board, Clinton has  
attempted to increase the discussion of racial and ethnic issues in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to release a report this spring on the White  
House's racial reconciliation campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the recent past, NAACP Chairman Julian Bond said  
the future bears promising financial prospects for the association. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond said corporate giving to the association is up 40 percent  
and foundation gifts 50 percent over the past year. Revenue from 
memberships is up $2.7 million in the last year, Bond said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have many other good things to talk about Saturday,''  
Bond said. 
</P>
<P>
	Funding has been critical since the National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People teetered on insolvency during the 
mid-1990s. Debt totaling $3 million and internal leadership battles 
at the time also hampered the association. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond said the NAACP has organized 34 new college and high school  
chapters, including offshoots at Harvard University and Stanford 
University and has sought to put race relations as a critical issue 
on the nation's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond and NAACP President Kweisi Mfume, who is responsible for  
day-to-day operations, will address delegates and members from the 
group's 2,220 local units Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond will discuss the state of race relations. Other topics to  
be examined at the meeting are protecting affirmative action, 
considering the problem of police brutality and helping ex-felons 
have their rights to vote restored. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were founded in 1909 to fight a rising tide of white  
supremacy,'' Bond said. ``Sadly, while legal apartheid has been 
vanquished, our democracy is still stained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the NAACP and the American Cancer Society will  
sponsor a national breast and cervical cancer training workshop in 
Washington designed to help bring attention to the illnesses, which 
strike black women at disproportionately high rates.

	New Workplace Safety Rules Unveiled  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Occupational Safety and Health  
Administration is unveiling proposed standards Friday to reduce 
employee injuries caused by repetitive motion, awkward postures or 
ill-fitting equipment in the work place. The long-awaited 
``ergonomics'' standards are intended to help thwart stress trauma 
cases such as carpal tunnel syndrome and back strains that are 
caused by repeated motions. Employers could be forced to alter work 
stations, redesign facilities or change tools and equipment used by 
workers, according to a Labor Department official speaking on 
condition of anonymity.

	Clinton Stumps for Gore 2000 Bid  
</P>
<P>
	DOVER, N.H. (AP) -- President Clinton tonight urged a gathering  
at a Democratic fund-raiser in New Hampshire to support Al Gore's 
presidential bid in 2000. It was the first political trip of 
Clinton's post-impeachment era. ``Nobody had more to do with the 
decisions we've made and success we've enjoyed than Vice President 
Al Gore,'' Clinton said. During the day, Clinton pushed his plan 
for targeted tax cuts and saving Social Security. He hosted a panel 
discussion with Gov. Jeanne Shaheen.

his candidacy today for the Republican nomination, speaking at the 
high school where he once gave civics exams, Smith backs beefing up 
defense, ending abortion and strengthening constitutional rights. 
He was elected in 1984 to the first of three congressional terms. 
Smith was elected to the Senate in 1990 and re-elected by a narrow 
margin in 1996.

	Study Says Pesticides Harm Kids  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some fruits and vegetables have pesticide  
residues that could be unsafe for young children, and the 
government is not doing enough about it, claims a Consumer Reports 
study released Thursday. Children subjected to the pesticides may 
be vulnerable to neurological damage and abnormal hormonal 
activity, according to the study, which offered no clinical proof 
of such harm. The study, published in the March issue, said 
peaches, winter squash, apples, green beans, pears and spinach have 
the highest levels of pesticides. Some scientists were quick to 
discredit the study.

	Air Bag Jury Awards $58.5M

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A jury today ordered DaimlerChrysler to pay  
$58.5 million in a class-action lawsuit filed by a woman whose hand 
was burned when her car's air bag inflated in an accident. The jury 
awarded $730 to each of 75,000 plaintiffs from Pennsylvania to buy 
safer air bags for Chrysler vehicles made between 1988 and 1990. 
The state court jury also awarded $3.8 million in punitive damages 
to the plaintiffs. The automaker plans to appeal the decision.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia  
today was warned by the United States to choose peace with Kosovo's 
ethnic Albanians or face a NATO military strike. Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright vowed: ``He will be hit hard, and he will be 
deprived of the things that he values.'' Albright is to return to 
peace talks in France tomorrow. Serbs and ethnic Albanians have 
until noon Saturday to reach agreement on a self-rule plan for 
Kosovo.

	Clinics Threatened With Anthrax  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At least four abortion clinics and a Planned  
Parenthood center closed today after receiving packages with 
warnings they contained anthrax. The FBI planned to analyze the 
materials sent to a Planned Parenthood center in Manchester, N.H., 
and abortion clinics in Washington, D.C., Milwaukee, Cincinnati and 
Rapid City, S.D. As with other recent anthrax threats, there was no 
indication the deadly bacterium was actually used. Planned 
Parenthood centers in Sioux Falls, S.D., and Burlington, Vt., also

<HEADLINE> IRS: Electronic Returns Are Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service says the number  
of tax returns filed electronically and the amount of the average 
refund are both up compared with last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Through Feb. 12, IRS had received 13.3 million electronic  
returns, an 11 percent increase over the same period last year. The 
number of self-prepared tax returns filed electronically soared 
from 218,000 during the period last year to 624,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Total returns filed so far have topped 23.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	``More than half of the early filers have e-filed by computer or  
by phone,'' IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said Thursday. 
``These taxpayers appreciate the comfort of having more accurate 
returns and faster refunds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The average refund so far is $1,823, up 14 percent from last  
year. And 9.4 million returns asked for direct deposit of the 
money, an 18.7 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS officials say the new child and education tax credits --  
which reduce taxes on a dollar-for-dollar basis -- are the main 
reason for the higher refunds.

<HEADLINE> What Will Scandal Veterans Do Now? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jim Kennedy's pager only beeped once last  
weekend. After more than a year of all-Monica, all-the-time, it was 
like a mini-vacation for the spokesman for the White House 
counsel's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The players in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and the reporters  
who covered them, suddenly find themselves free to resume a more 
normal life after the impeachment trial ended with acquittal last 
week. They're settling into a slower pace or making up missed 
vacations. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, who on some days received as many as 60 pager messages,  
said he was catching up on long-postponed personal business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to get my teeth cleaned,'' Kennedy said. ``And I need a  
haircut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's private attorney, David Kendall, said he  
plans to devote himself to ``going to movies, reading novels, and 
skiing.'' He spent his first post-impeachment weekend in New York 
with his wife and son dining out and seeing the Broadway hit 
``Rent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy White House counsel Lanny Breuer will be leaving the  
administration at the end of March to return to his job as partner 
at the law firm of Covington and Burling. ``I am going to spend 
some time building up my practice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Capitol Hill is deserted this week. Congressional leaders fled  
Washington for a weeklong recess in their home states, a chance to 
relax a little and mingle with voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of the Republican  
House members who prosecuted Clinton's case in the Senate, said he 
was gratified by the response at his first post-impeachment 
appearance back home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first reaction was that 700 people stood up and clapped  
for 20 minutes,'' Graham said during a televised town hall meeting 
Tuesday night. ``I'll remember it for the rest of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most in the Washington press corps are ready for a change, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Bob Franken of CNN spent much of the last year covering the  
scandal from Arkansas to Capitol Hill. One day he went before the 
cameras 25 times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I am just looking forward to going somewhere in the sun,  
scuba diving and getting away from it all,'' Franken said 
wistfully. He was still on the job Wednesday and can't take 
vacation for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran reporter John Palmer of NBC News says his hectic  
schedule covering the president won't change much, but focusing on 
issues other than scandal and impeachment will be refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never had I thought Social Security and education could be so  
exciting,'' Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plato Cacheris, one of Ms. Lewinsky's attorneys, was unavailable  
for comment. He was on vacation all week.

	Virostko tamed waves an estimated 20 feet high, hardly  
Mavericks' 50-foot potential, but enough for the well-liked local 
to take home the trophy and $15,000 first prize check. Virostko 
plunged into his first wave after seeing a fellow surfer catch a 
big one before him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second one was even as big if not bigger, and so I went on  
that one. I barely sketched into it and made it. Got two more waves 
after that. I did an air drop and got tubed a little bit. That's 
just how it worked out,'' Virostko said. ``I'm stoked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virostko pulled a high-scoring ``air drop,'' in which a surfer  
free-falls, losing contact with his board on descent, then lands 
and rides the wave successfully. 
</P>
<P>
	Contest sponsors were so impressed with the move they added a  
$5,000 bonus to the original $10,000 first prize for Virostko. 
</P>
<P>
	The competitors were battling the same waters that claimed the  
life of top Hawaiian pro Mark Foo in 1994. A wooden cross memorial 
still marks the cliffside spot overlooking the waters where Foo 
died trying to conquer Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
	The contest started late Wednesday as fog shrouded the rocky  
coastline about 22 miles south of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Surfers rode some 30-foot breakers but at least three  
competitors were swept into a rocky area known as the Boneyard and 
had to be rescued. No one was seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Before heading out for his heat, Australian contestant Ross  
Clarke-Jones described his simple game plan: ``I'm going to hold my 
breath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few spots in the world boast bigger waves, and virtually none  
are as steep and unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
	The waves break far offshore and their explosive whitewater can  
knock surfers to the bottom, holding them under long enough to 
drown or drag them across jagged, rocky outcroppings. The water 
temperature for the contest was a chilly 52 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Contest director Jeff Clark discovered Mavericks about 20 years  
ago but let few in on the secret before 1990. Ever since, it has 
attracted oceangoing daredevils from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty surfers competed Wednesday, some coming from Hawaii and  
Australia. Most were residents of Northern California, the 
mainland's primary big-wave mecca. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 300 people lined the beach or scaled cliffs to view the  
action. Some were awe-struck by the monstrous surf. 
</P>
<P>
	Others questioned the surfers' sanity.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're psychotic,'' said Kelly McKinley. ``They have  
a couple of screws loose. It's kind of like Evel Knievel when he 
jumps and does his tricks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, for one surfer, it wasn't enough.  
</P>
<P>
	Said fourth-place finisher Peter Mel: ``I definitely wanted it  
to be a little bigger.''

<HEADLINE> EPA Is Sued Over Gene-Altered Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A growing trend of genetically altering crops  
with an ingrown biological pesticide is too risky for the 
environment, a coalition of environmentalists and organic farmers 
charged in a lawsuit Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	They want to force the government to end its approval of what  
are known as Bt crops. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court by Greenpeace  
International, the Center for Food Safety and the International 
Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements charges the 
Environmental Protection Agency with ``wanton destruction'' of Bt, 
which it calls the ``world's most important biological pesticide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just another short term fix that industry is willing  
to use up,'' said Jane Rissler, a senior scientist with the Union 
of Concerned Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Kalee Kreider, a Greenpeace spokeswoman, ``These crops are  
an environmental disaster waiting to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The complainants are concerned that using the pesticide in  
genetically altered plants poses environmental risks that will 
change the ecological balance as well as hurt organic farmers who 
don't want to use genetically-altered products. They complain that 
EPA has failed to address their concerns since approving the 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA approved the use of Bt in potatoes in 1995 and has since  
agreed to its use in corn and cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit demands that EPA cancel registration of all  
genetically engineered Bt plants; cease approval of any new Bt 
plants and immediately perform an environmental impact assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can no longer sit idly by,'' said Joseph Mendelson, legal  
director for the Center for Food Safety. ``EPA has shown a blatant 
disregard for federal law and its own regulations by approving Bt 
crops without fully assessing their environmental safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bt is actually a soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, that  
produces toxins to kill insects. It has been used for years as a 
spray by farmers and gardeners who like the fact that it kills 
insects while remaining nontoxic to mammals. 
</P>
<P>
	But the use of Bt has changed in recent years with advances in  
genetic engineering. Scientists are now able to develop plants that 
contain a gene for Bt toxin, giving the crops built-in protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The move has been controversial, however, as many groups have  
raised concerns that insects will become resistant to Bt, which 
would seriously hurt organic farmers who are permitted to use Bt 
insecticides as their only emergency pest control option. 
</P>
<P>
	An EPA spokesman defended the agency's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``EPA carefully makes sure that the biotech products we review  
fully comply with all legal requirements designed to ensure that 
they are environmentally sound and environmentally beneficial,'' 
said spokesman Dave Cohen. ``We believe the actions we've taken 
with regard to Bt will be sustained against this legal challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some organic farmers say an even bigger threat is pollination  
from the genetically-altered plant seeping from conventional farms 
to organic farms. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Walker, president of Terra Firma Inc. -- an organic food  
company in Hudson, Wis., said he was forced to recall over $100,000 
worth of organic tortilla chips that had been contaminated with 
genetically-engineered corn. He blames pollination from another 
farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless Bt corn is withdrawn, it will soon contaminate every  
corn field in the country,'' Walker said.

<HEADLINE> Freeman Makes His Case for $6M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Antonio Freeman figures it's payback time --  
time for the Green Bay Packers to make him the first $6 million 
receiver.. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've played hurt. I've played with a broken arm, a broken jaw,  
I've stuck my neck out to play football,'' Freeman said Thursday. 
``I think it's time for management to do what it's supposed to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman, the team's franchise player, said the Packers' initial  
offer last week was for $4.4 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not even in the ballpark,'' Freeman said. ``And they  
know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers won't comment on the negotiations, but general  
manager Ron Wolf said signing Freeman to a long-term deal is the 
team's top offseason priority. 
</P>
<P>
	As the franchise player, Freeman would be guaranteed about $3.5  
million in 1999. But he and his agent, Joel Segal, insist he won't 
play for anything less than $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market value right now is $6 million. They could have had  
me for half that, for $3 million, had they signed me last summer. 
But they waited and now I'm benefiting,'' Freeman said. ``It's not 
my fault that salaries have skyrocketed. They're the ones who 
waited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Freeman said his value could go even higher if free agent  
wide receivers Rob Moore, Carl Pickens or J.J. Stokes sign for $6 
million or more a year before he signs his extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman says he'll follow in halfback Dorsey Levens' footsteps  
and hold out all summer if he has to. And he said he was perplexed 
that the Packers offered him below market rate two days before 
signing defensive lineman Santana Dotson to a deal averaging more 
than $5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He deserves it, I'm not saying he doesn't,'' Freeman said.  
``But here they are offering less to a premier player. It doesn't 
make sense. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman said he needs to be in training camp on time to acquaint  
himself with new coach Ray Rhodes and his staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Brett Favre said last month that it's essential for  
the Packers to meet Freeman's price so he can attend offseason 
workouts, and Freeman agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to be in camp. I need to be there, but I can't go until  
I'm satisfied,'' he said. ``Antonio Freeman needs to be in camp. 
There's no way you can substitute timing, especially in this 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman, who starred in the Packers' two Super Bowls, led the  
NFL in receiving yardage and earned his first Pro Bowl berth in 
1998 while playing for a one-year tender of $1.153 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to stay in Green Bay. Green Bay is where I want to  
be,'' Freeman said. ``I've made sacrifices and now it's time for 
them to make one for me.''

<HEADLINE> Pa. Faith Healers Get Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The faith-healing parents of a hemophiliac  
child who died in his mother's arms from a cut toe were sentenced 
Thursday to 17 years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean and Susan Heilman, who believe in prayer rather than  
medicine to heal illnesses, pleaded no contest in October to 
charges of involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment in the 
death of their son, Dean Michael. 
</P>
<P>
	Although a prosecutor urged jail time for the ``baby killers,''  
the judge said she saw no malicious intent on the part of the 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The major difference here is that Dean Michael was loved,''  
Judge Carolyn Engel Temin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ordered the Heilmans to find a licensed pediatrician  
for their other two children, ages 1 and 5, and to get them medical 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Heilman, 34, left the courtroom holding his Bible in one  
hand and his 36-year-old wife's hand in the other. Neither would 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy cut his toe in July 1997, and his parents -- both raised  
as members of the Faith Tabernacle Congregation Church -- prayed for 
his recovery rather than seek medical help.

<HEADLINE> Judge Gives Pilots' Union More Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge has extended his order requiring  
American Airlines' pilot union to encourage its members to show up 
for work. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall said yesterday he would extend  
from March 8 to May 12 his temporary restraining order to the 
Allied Pilots Association. 
</P>
<P>
	For 10 days this month, thousands of pilots, frustrated with  
contract talks, called in sick. The results were delays for more 
than 600,000 passengers and cancellations of about 6,600 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge yesterday also delayed for more than six weeks his  
decision on how to punish the union for originally ignoring his 
order to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to cool down and take the loaded guns away from each  
other's heads,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	The APA asked Kendall to allow it extra time to examine  
American's claim of $58.7 million in damages suffered when 
thousands of flights were grounded from 4 p.m. last Wednesday until 
late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, American estimates that the job action cost it more  
than $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall had ordered the pilots back into their cockpits last  
Wednesday. On Saturday, he held the union and two top board members 
in contempt and said he would fine them. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall continued the damages hearing until April 12.  
</P>
<P>
	The sickout began Feb. 6 after American pilots lost patience  
with Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp., parent company of the 
airline. According to the APA, the company had ignored their 
contract by purchasing Reno Air Corp. and not immediately 
increasing pay for all pilots affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations continued on the issue Wednesday, but the sticking  
point remained that the union wants pilots to be paid retroactively 
to Dec. 23, the date of the airline purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has said it proposed to immediately increase pay up  
to 56 percent for pilots of Reno Air, which was purchased by AMR in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots' pay is half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot is paid.

<HEADLINE>  Ocalan To Be Tried at Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan will  
be tried at the island prison in the Sea of Marmara where he is 
being held, Turkey's Justice Ministry announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision reflected Turkey's desire to maintain strict  
security throughout the trial, after days of attacks at embassies 
and consulates throughout Europe and elsewhere by Kurds protesting 
Ocalan's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Kurds were killed by Israeli security guards while  
attempting to storm the Israeli consulate in Berlin on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ocalan, has filed a  
complaint at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, 
France, protesting his arrest by Turks in the Kenyan capital, 
Nairobi, a court statement said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint charges the arrest and detention violated four  
articles of the European Convention on Human Rights that guarantee 
a right to personal liberty and security, the right to life, a ban 
on torture of prisoners and the right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether the court would hear the complaint.  
</P>
<P>
	Many of the demonstrations across Europe ended Wednesday. But  
about 40 protesters held a clerk hostage in the Greek Embassy in 
London and announced they were beginning a hunger strike, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters promised today that they would leave the embassy  
provided they are not arrested and are allowed to make a statement 
to the media. Occupations also continued at the offices of 
political parties in Sweden and Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany, Kurds attacked Turkish restaurants, stores and  
travel agencies early today, injuring six people, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Istanbul, Ocalan supporters protested overnight. Four buses  
and two cars were set on fire, and the windows of several other 
vehicles were smashed. Police detained an unspecified number of 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 700 Kurdish activists -- most members of a pro-Kurdish  
political party -- have been rounded up in Istanbul and several 
southeastern Turkish cities since Ocalan's arrest, according to the 
independent Human Rights Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, stormed  
Greek diplomatic missions on Tuesday after hearing word of Ocalan's 
capture a day earlier by Turks in Kenya, where he had been hiding 
in the Greek ambassador's residence in Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurdish protesters also targeted Israel after reports suggested  
that the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, had a hand in the 
operation. Israel denied the report and temporarily closed down its 
diplomatic missions in Europe as a security measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department on Wednesday warned that American interests  
could be targeted by Kurdish violence, and urged U.S. citizens 
traveling or living abroad to review their personal security. 
</P>
<P>
	The PKK's strength in Europe comes from tens of thousands of  
Kurds who have fled Turkey, most seeking political asylum in 
European countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey blames the 49-year-old Ocalan for 37,000 deaths that  
occurred during the fight between his rebels and Turkish military 
since the uprising began in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey has often been accused of human rights abuses during its  
war against the PKK and many European countries have expressed 
concern over Ocalan's trial, despite Turkey's assurances he will be 
treated fairly. Turkey has barred three of Ocalan's foreign lawyers 
from entering the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In an apparent effort to show that Ocalan would not be  
mistreated, the government released a video tape of the rebel 
leader during his flight to Turkey. On the dramatic footage, a 
Turkish officer asks a handcuffed and blindfolded Ocalan to relax 
and says, ``you are our guest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the government released more footage showing Ocalan  
standing in front of two Turkish flags after being taken to the 
prison-island of Imrali in the Sea of Marmara. 
</P>
<P>
	``My eyes are bothered,'' Ocalan answers a commander at one  
point while wincing under camera lights. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's capture has brought the conflict back into the  
limelight. The 12 million Kurds in Turkey are denied the right to 
use the Kurdish language in education and broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports said authorities have already begun interrogating him at  
the island prison. Inmates on Imrali Island, about 35 miles south 
of Istanbul, were transferred to other prisons and the guards were 
replaced by special commando teams as an extra security measure. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear when a trial there would begin, but Prime  
Minister Bulent Ecevit has said it would be soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan was already being tried in absentia on charges of  
terrorism and evading compulsory military service. He could face 
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The capture of Ocalan has not stopped Turkish troops from  
tracking down the rebels. They launched an incursion into northern 
Iraq on Monday to hit rebel bases there. Ecevit called the 
operations routine.

standing in front of two Turkish flags after being taken to the 
prison-island of Imrali in the Sea of Marmara. 
</P>
<P>
	``My eyes are bothered,'' Ocalan answers a commander at one  
point while wincing under camera lights. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's capture has brought the conflict back into the  
limelight. The 12 million Kurds in Turkey are denied the right to 
use the Kurdish language in education and broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports said authorities have already begun interrogating him at  
the island prison. Inmates on Imrali Island, about 35 miles south 
of Istanbul, were transferred to other prisons and the guards were 
replaced by special commando teams as an extra security measure. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear when a trial there would begin, but Prime  
Minister Bulent Ecevit has said it would be soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan was already being tried in absentia on charges of  
terrorism and evading compulsory military service. He could face 
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The capture of Ocalan has not stopped Turkish troops from  
tracking down the rebels. They launched an incursion into northern 
Iraq on Monday to hit rebel bases there. Ecevit called the 
operations routine.

<HEADLINE> MacLaine Honored at Film Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Shirley MacLaine's movies won her a lifetime  
achievement award at the Berlin Film Festival, where she bantered 
with reporters about the perils of romancing movie co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLaine, 64, was honored Thursday with a Golden Bear Award for  
her 55 films dating to Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 thriller ``The 
Trouble with Harry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference before the ceremony, she admitted to having  
fallen in love with numerous co-stars until she got wise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very seductive being on the set, especially when you're  
young and have raging hormones,'' she said. ``I would give 
something like that four months, but they are so romantic, intense 
and passionate you can't imagine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plus they're some of the best-looking men around. So for all  
the young actresses, I would say go for it,'' she said, drawing a 
laugh.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Steel Exports Jump 17 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Led by a sharp rise in shipments to the United  
States, Japan's overall steel exports jumped 17.6 percent last year 
to 27.65 million metric tons, according to an industry report 
published Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight year of growth in steel export  
volume. The amount of steel sold abroad jumped 14.2 percent in 
1997, said Yoshihisa Hino, spokesman for the Japan Iron and Steel 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of value, however, steel exports fell 8.6 percent on a  
dollar basis to $15.76 billion and 0.3 percent on a yen basis to 
2.073 trillion yen, the federation said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports to the U.S. market more than doubled in terms of volume,  
increasing 160 percent to 7.02 million metric tons from 1997 
levels. Wide strip hot-rolled coil exports to the United States 
rose 288 percent to 2.25 million metric tons, the federation said. 
</P>
<P>
	Total ordinary steel exports to the United States surged 188  
percent to 5.39 million tons, while specialty steel exports rose 
48.4 percent to 814,587 metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
	The federation's annual report came as Japanese exports of steel  
to the United States have become a major trade issue between the 
two nations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, major U.S. steelmakers and the United Steelworkers  
Union filed import complaints, accusing Japan and seven other 
nations of selling cut-to-length steel in the U.S. market at less 
than production costs and home market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the U.S. government said it had evidence that Japan  
and Brazil had illegally dumped hot-rolled steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese steelmakers have said Japan's sharp rise in exports  
last year came largely at the request of the U.S. steelmakers 
themselves and steel users to meet a domestic supply shortage.

<HEADLINE> Kurds May Be Israel's Newest Enemy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel woke up Thursday morning and found it  
may have acquired a new enemy -- the Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two days earlier, few in Israel paid much attention to the  
violent Kurdish protests at dozens of embassies and consulates 
across Europe. But then Kurdish and German media suggested that 
Israel's Mossad spy agency helped Turkey track Kurdish rebel leader 
Abdullah Ocalan. 
</P>
<P>
	Events quickly spun out of control, despite Israel's vehement  
denial of involvement in Ocalan's capture this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Kurds who forced their way into Israel's consulate in  
Berlin were gunned down Wednesday by Israeli security guards. On 
Thursday, an Israeli newspaper quoted a Kurdish leader as saying 
Israel had become a chief target for revenge attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmed Yaman, a spokesman for a Rome-based Kurdish umbrella  
group, told the Yediot Ahronot daily that such strikes would be 
carried out against Israelis in Turkey and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Mizgin Sen, a spokeswoman in Brussels, Belgium, for  
Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, told The Associated Press 
that the group has never targeted Israelis and would not do so now. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kurds are angry and disappointed (over the Berlin  
shooting) but we are not going to wage our war in Europe or 
anywhere else,'' Sen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Security has been beefed up at Israeli diplomatic missions in  
Europe and at Ben-Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel has also reached out to Kurdish leaders, explaining that  
it is not an enemy and wants to avoid an escalation, Israeli 
intelligence expert Yossi Melman told Israel radio. 
</P>
<P>
	A diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed that  
Israel has contacted Kurdish groups through third parties but would 
not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fear it is already too late and Israel -- a target of  
Palestinian terrorist attacks in the past -- has unwittingly gotten 
itself entangled in a superfluous confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	Alon Liel, a diplomat at the Israeli embassy in Turkey during  
the 1980s, said the shooting could have serious repercussions and 
suggested that the security guards may have been too hasty in 
opening fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing we need is a Kurdish front,'' Liel wrote in the  
Maariv daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel has in the past supported Kurdish rebels in Iraq, but has  
not backed the PKK, which has been fighting for independence in 
southeastern Turkey since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Israel has formed a strong military alliance  
with Turkey and the two have reportedly exchanged intelligence on 
militant groups. The close cooperation helped fuel rumors that the 
Mossad had a hand in tracking down Ocalan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We call on Israel to stop its collaboration with Turkey  
because it is used against the Kurds,'' Sen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli commentators noted that the PKK has consorted with  
Israel's enemies -- it had operated training camps in Lebanon and 
Ocalan was given refuge in Syria for years.

<HEADLINE>  Simpson Memorabilia Set on Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Boos and cheers erupted when O.J. Simpson  
memorabilia went up in smoke, torched at the behest of a man who 
bought $16,000 worth of the football star's belongings at a 
court-ordered auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Two No. 32 football jerseys and a Professional Football Hall of  
Fame induction certificate were set ablaze and two trophies were 
smashed outside the Criminal Courts Building on Wednesday in a 
protest organized by Christian radio talk show host Bob Enyart of 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Enyart said he did it to protest Simpson's acquittal on murder  
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are destroying O.J. Simpson's property in front of the L.A.  
courthouse because the criminal justice system is destroying 
justice before our very eyes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Auction proceeds will help pay off the $33.5 million Simpson  
owes in the 1994 killings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and 
her friend Ronald Goldman. A civil jury found him liable for the 
deaths after he was acquitted of criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale Tuesday raised $430,000, including a high bid of  
$255,500 for Simpson's 1968 Heisman Trophy, bought by an East Coast 
collector. The bids included a premium for the auction house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I should say thank you for paying off $16,000 of my  
debt,'' Simpson said Wednesday in a telephone interview with The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said Enyart could have spent the money on better causes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wonder about the mentality involved in this. The guy's  
burning up $16,000 he could use to fight AIDS or help kids with 
cancer or even donate to battered (women's) homes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson called the protest a waste. Some spectators also  
disagreed with the destruction of the items, which included jerseys 
from the University of Southern California and the National 
Football League's Buffalo Bills, and two 1973 ``Lifesaver'' 
trophies apparently given for charity contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Yolanda Harris likened the destruction to defacing the flag and  
said the items should have gone to his children. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a legacy. It had nothing to do with what he did,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the items auctioned by phone, in person and over the  
Internet were Tiffany-style lamps, artwork and a fox fur coat that 
belonged to Simpson's first wife, Marguerite. It went for $550. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson, who is appealing the judgment, said the sum raised by  
the auction proves the civil court award was illegal, since his 
suable worth was only $430,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave a judgment that is 77 times more than that,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> INS To Deploy 1,600 New Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is deploying 1,000 new Border  
Patrol agents, mostly in Texas and Arizona, to fight illegal 
immigration, the nation's top immigration official says. 
</P>
<P>
	Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and  
Naturalization Service, also said the INS still is looking for ways 
to deal with a shortage of detention space but does not plan to 
release illegal aliens convicted of such crimes as burglary, 
assault and drug offenses to make room for offenders with more 
serious criminal records. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, and Rep. Elton Gallegly,  
R-Calif., sent a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno demanding 
that Meissner be replaced if she does not act quickly to improve 
detention and deportation of illegal aliens. They also said they 
hoped with the letter would stop any discussion of releasing 
criminal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Smith said he believed the INS reversed itself.  
</P>
<P>
	``Common sense has prevailed at the INS,'' he said. ``It is  
inconceivable why they even considered an idea that would so 
endanger the public. ... I am hopeful that now the agency will 
focus on fixing its mismanagement of handling criminal aliens to 
make the best use of its budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meissner said the 1,000 new positions will help reinforce law  
enforcement in those areas and break smuggling rings that moved to 
the El Centro, Calif., area after a crackdown in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS will send 485 agents to Texas, 395 to Arizona, 83 to  
California, 15 to New Mexico and 22 to three places on the border 
with Canada, Meissner told reporters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS budget stands at a record $3.9 billion for this fiscal  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after Smith and Gallegy told reporters about their letter,  
the White House released a statement expressing President Clinton's 
full support and confidence in Meissner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no intention of resigning,'' she told reporters  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said the Clinton administration plans to ask Congress  
for an additional $80 million this year to pay for more than 3,000 
new detention beds it expects to need for Central Americans fleeing 
the devastation of Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also is working on plans to regain some of its  
discretionary power to free up detention space by releasing 
criminal aliens who represent no threat to the community, she said. 
That authority was canceled by an immigration overhaul bill 
Congress passed in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Deere Plans Extended Shutdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOLINE, Ill. (AP) -- A bigger-than-expected decline in demand for  
farm equipment has led Deere &AMP; Co. to extend summer plant shutdowns 
by up to five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're responding to the marketplace,'' Deere spokesman Ken  
Golden said Thursday. ``Retail demand for farm equipment in North 
America we now predict to be declining by 25 percent this year. 
Just three months ago we were talking about 20 percent. So, it 
continues to weaken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,400 employees at the Harvester Works in East Moline will  
be out of work for three weeks in May and again for two weeks at 
the end of July. That July shutdown leads into the plant's annual 
shutdown, which runs July 26 to Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seeding Group in Moline, with 280 factory workers, will shut  
down from May 3 to the end of the month. The company had also 
previously announced that its plant north of Des Moines, Iowa, 
which makes cotton-harvesting equipment, would shut down four 
separate weeks of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Deere reported a 75 percent drop in  
first-quarter profits from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Golden said the decision to extend the regular vacation  
shutdowns has less to do with profits and more to do with the level 
of inventory owned by Deere and in dealer showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are attempting to match our production with customer  
demand,'' he said. Demand for combines and large tractors has 
fallen sharply from a year ago as farmers try to cope with 
commodity prices driven down by a glutted global marketplace at a 
time of financial turmoil in Asia, Russia and Latin America.

<HEADLINE> European Central Bank Keeps Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Central Bank kept its key  
interest rate unchanged at 3 percent during a regular meeting 
Thursday attended by Germany Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine, a 
fierce advocate of lowering rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine has steadily argued since taking office last fall  
that Europe's central bankers should lower rates to help boost 
growth and ease stubborn unemployment. In the 11 nations that 
adopted the single euro currency, unemployment stands at 10.8 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments have mostly been met with strong statements by  
central bankers defending the bank's independence from political 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time Thursday, Lafontaine made his appeal during  
the board's regular biweekly meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine, who was permitted to speak, but not vote, left the  
meeting with the governing council still in session. He emphasized 
that he was leaving before any decisions were made. 
</P>
<P>
	The ECB had been widely expected to leave rates unchanged, given  
the weaker euro. The common currency is now worth $1.124 after 
being launched Jan. 1 at $1.1776. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday in Brussels, Lafontaine said there were  
convincing economic reasons for cutting rates, referring to a 
recent analysis made by European retail banks that said a rate cut 
wouldn't push up inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates in the euro bloc were set at a uniform 3 percent  
before the single euro currency was launched Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's economic policy adviser, Klaus  
Gretschmann, said Wednesday that he expected the ECB to cut its 
rate by up to 0.5 percentage points this year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said he doesn't expect the ECB to lower rates until  
annual wage negotiations are over.

<HEADLINE> Auburn's Porter To Play Next Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Chris Porter, the leading scorer and  
rebounder for No. 3 Auburn, said he will return to school for his 
senior season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the last thing on my mind,'' Porter told The Huntsville  
Times. ``I'm not talking to any agents, anybody from the NBA. I 
like watching the NBA play, but I'm not going anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, a 6-foot-7 transfer from Chipola (Fla.) Junior College,  
has been a huge key in the Tigers' success this season. It had been 
widely rumored that he would leave Auburn for the NBA draft after 
the season, but the junior forward dismissed that option following 
Wednesday's 81-63 win over Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here to have fun,'' he said. ``College life is the best  
thing in the world. Why would I leave? I will be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter had 19 points and 11 rebounds in the win over Vanderbilt,  
which gave Auburn a share of its first Southeastern Conference 
title since 1960. Porter, who said it was his goal as a child 
growing up in Abbeville to someday play for Auburn, then helped cut 
down the nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must say I did dream about (winning a championship), but I  
never did know it would come true,'' Porter said. ``It felt great 
just to be a part of it.''

<HEADLINE>  Inmate Testifies in Dragging Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Dragging-death defendant John William King  
once talked about ``taking a black out'' -- committing murder -- as a 
way to get into a white supremacist gang, a former fellow inmate 
testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``To help new recruits get initiated, take somebody out and kill  
them. You have to spill blood to get in and give blood to get out, 
I guess,'' convicted robber William Hoover testified, recounting 
what he says King told him while they were both in prison a few 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, is the first of three white men to go on trial in the  
slaying of James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old black man who was abducted 
last June, chained to a pickup truck and dragged three miles until 
his body was torn to pieces. King could get the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear from Hoover's testimony about the prison  
conversation who would do the killing or what gang they were 
talking about. But prosecutors have said that King killed Byrd to 
gain credibility for a racist group he was organizing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoover, 28, said the idea described by King was to abduct a  
black man, ``kidnap him maybe, put him in the trunk of a car, take 
him out in the woods ... kill him'' to ``prove your loyalty to your 
organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say King's idea nearly matches what happened to  
Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
	King was in prison for a burglary at the time.  
</P>
<P>
	In other testimony, defense attorneys suggested that King's many  
racist tattoos were a means of helping him survive in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning, the heavily tattooed Hoover said such  
markings are intended to show solidarity with other white inmates 
and ward off attacks from blacks. ``It does help to have close 
buddies like that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoover joined the Aryan Brotherhood, a white prison gang. King  
joined the Confederate Knights of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have cited King's tattoos as evidence of a seething  
hatred of blacks. The tattoos depict such things as the lynching of 
a black man, Nazi-style SS lightning bolts and the words ``Aryan 
Pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, and Shawn Allen Berry, 24, are to  
be tried later. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, testimony focused on the collection of evidence  
from the 3-mile-long dragging route, the truck used and the remote 
area where authorities said Byrd scuffled with his alleged 
abductors. 
</P>
<P>
	King's attorneys have questioned the handling of the evidence,  
suggesting it may be contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI forensics examiner matched a black fiber on a floor mat  
from the truck with a fiber found on one of Byrd's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Another analyst testified that casts of tire impressions made on  
the logging road where authorities say the dragging began matched 
the rear tires of the truck alleged to have been used. The same 
tracks, with overwhelming certainty, she said, were found outside 
the cemetery where the Byrd's headless torso was left. 
</P>
<P>
	And Tommy Faulk, a 15-year friend of King, testified authorities  
found a large chain buried behind his trailer home the day after 
King and Brewer had visited the afternoon of June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross examination, Faulk said he didn't see King or Brewer  
with a chain or whether they had buried it on his property. 
</P>
<P>
	But an FBI agent, Norman Townsend, testified that on June 8, the  
day after Byrd's death, Berry led him and other authorities to an 
area 30 yards behind Faulk's trailer, when Berry kicked up a piece 
of plywood covering a depression in the ground. Inside was a 
24 1/2-foot logging chain.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Defend Suspect's Tattoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Defense attorneys tried today to show that  
racist and satanic tattoos on a man accused of dragging a black man 
to his death were intended to help the defendant survive in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination, Jasper police officer Rich Ford  
acknowledged that the symbols on John William King's skin could be 
interpreted in different ways, but insisted they were meant to 
express values and beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some may have expression of love and some may have expression  
of hate,'' Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also acknowledged motivation for the tattoos could be  
meant to intimidate other inmates who might prey on a 5-foot-7 
white man in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the eye of the beholder,'' defense attorney Brack  
Jones told him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, sir,'' Ford replied.  
</P>
<P>
	King is accused of murdering James Byrd Jr. last year by  
chaining him to the back of a pickup truck and dragging him for 
nearly three miles along a bumpy asphalt road, dismembering his 
body. If convicted, King could face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other men, Lawrence Brewer, 31, and Shawn Berry, 23, also  
are charged and are to be tried later. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are portraying King as so hateful he proudly adorned  
his body with dozens of bold and intricate racist tattoos. He 
obtained most of them while he was in prison for a burglary 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	One depicts the lynching of a black man while others show  
Nazi-type SS lightning bolts, a satanic star and the sign of a 
white supremacist group and the words ``Aryan Pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously you can't commit a crime this heinous unless you've  
got a lot of hate and anger in your heart,'' prosecutor Guy James 
Gray said Wednesday after introducing photo of King's tattoos into 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Devils and monster faces and skulls and things like that are  
pretty consistent with somebody having a lot of hate in their 
heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King's attorneys had objected to the tattoo photos, saying the  
art was constitutionally protected as freedom of expression. State 
District Judge Joe Bob Golden overruled the objection. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've got a hanging black man on your arm, you're more  
likely to commit a crime against a black person,'' Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, an ex-girlfriend of King testified she saw him  
ride away in a gray pickup truck with Brewer and Berry. Prosecutors 
contend Byrd was chained to the truck an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray has said he believes the Byrd slaying was intended as a  
stunt to draw attention to a new white supremacist group King was 
forming in Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he hoped to complete the state's case by Friday.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Explores Impact of IOC Rift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney Olympics chief executive Sandy  
Hollway says the IOC should bear a share of cutbacks if the 2000 
Games fall short of their marketing target. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway ruled out a renegotiation of the Sydney Organizing  
Committee's controversial deal with the Australian Olympic 
Committee, which has guaranteed the AOC $65 million, regardless of 
the financial outcome of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC marketing director Michael Payne has criticized the deal and  
called for it to be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hollway, faced with a $130 million shortfall in the  
sponsorship budget, said he would look for discussions with the IOC 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the IOC, I think we can enter a discussion with them about  
some of the levels of service and entitlements in that whole host 
city contract,'' Hollway said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were always to be the athletes' games and we must make  
them the athletes' games. I think it's even more important in light 
of the controversy in the international Olympic movement that we 
reaffirm this is about sport and athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway said he would be reluctant to order cuts to the quality  
of venues or areas such as the Olympic village. He said the needs 
of broadcasters and media must be met because ``that's the way the 
games get out to the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG has already suggested some areas of change for IOC  
services, only to be rebuffed. When SOCOG president Michael Knight 
said IOC members might like to forego their chauffeur-driven 
limousines and get on buses, Payne responded by saying the IOC 
would ship their own Mercedes Benz cars to Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you'll hear that from Mr. Payne again,'' Knight  
said today. ``When you say get out of the cars and get on the bus, 
for an IOC apparatchik to come back with a suggestion that wouldn't 
they be better off in a Mercedes misses the point. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Samaranch is very much prepared to catch the ferry or the  
bus. When he was here last year and I raised with him the 
possibility of IOC members catching the bus, he indicated he would 
be urging them very strongly to do so. He thought it was a sensible 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway said the IOC's bribes scandals were making it harder to  
raise sponsorship money, but he still thinks it's possible to reach 
the marketing goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutbacks should be ``put to one side entirely while we get on  
with ... boosting revenue raising and having a look in April.'' He 
said the IOC's report, expected in March, on corruption within its 
ranks would have a bearing on the sponsorship drive. 
</P>
<P>
	He said three new sponsors were expected to be ratified by the  
SOCOG board later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway said the AOC, which stitched up the profit-share deal in  
exchange for its veto powers over SOCOG decisions, is entitled to 
its money. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the AOC's concerned, they've got a contract and I  
don't see why they would or should shift away from that,'' Hollway 
said. ``In a sense, I would like to see Australian athletes have 
that legacy out of our Olympics in perpetuity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight and AOC president John Coates have also rejected a change  
in the deal.

<HEADLINE>  Inmate Testifies in Dragging Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Dragging-death defendant John William King  
once talked about ``taking a black out'' -- committing murder -- as a 
way to get into a white supremacist gang, a former fellow inmate 
testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``To help new recruits get initiated, take somebody out and kill  
them. You have to spill blood to get in and give blood to get out, 
I guess,'' convicted robber William Hoover testified, recounting 
what he says King told him while they were both in prison a few 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, is the first of three white men to go on trial in the  
slaying of James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old black man who was abducted 
last June, chained to a pickup truck and dragged three miles until 
his body was torn to pieces. King could get the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear from Hoover's testimony about the prison  
conversation who would do the killing or what gang they were 
talking about. But prosecutors have said that King killed Byrd to

<HEADLINE> Deal Set for Lewinsky TV Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky's lawyers and prosecutors in  
Kenneth Starr's office have agreed to restrictions that will allow 
the former White House intern to be interviewed by ABC's Barbara 
Walters, two legal sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the arrangement, reached after several days of  
discussions, Starr is permitting Ms. Lewinsky to talk about a wide 
range of topics pertaining to the investigation of President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The main limitation is that she cannot make statements that go  
beyond what she has already told the grand jury and Starr's office 
in numerous interviews, the sources added, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABC interview would be aired during the February ratings  
``sweeps'' period, which ends March 3. 
</P>
<P>
	March 5 is the publication date of ``Monica's Story,'' a  
collaboration between Ms. Lewinsky and Princess Diana biographer 
Andrew Morton. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly did not immediately return phone  
calls seeking comment. ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy declined to 
comment, as did Lewinsky spokeswoman Judy Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal came as another of Starr's four deputies announced he  
is leaving the investigation to join a Washington law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon Wisenberg departs next month to become a partner in the  
Washington office of Ross, Dixon &AMP; Bell, a 75-lawyer firm. He 
conducted much of the grand jury questioning of witnesses in the 
Lewinsky investigation and questioned Clinton extensively in the 
president's videotaped grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr deputy Robert Bittman has already left the office.  
</P>
<P>
	People familiar with Starr's plans say both Bittman and  
Wisenberg will be replaced. Starr deputies Hickman Ewing and Jackie 
Bennett remain, along with a staff of prosecutors who are preparing 
for three trials in the next four months -- against longtime 
presidential friend Webster Hubbell, the Clintons' ex-Whitewater 
partner Susan McDougal and a Virginia woman, Julie Hiatt Steele, 
who is involved in Starr's investigation of whether the president 
made an unwanted sexual advance against former White House 
volunteer Kathleen Willey.

<HEADLINE>  QB Couch Has Heard Critics Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Tim Couch's has heard the critics.  
</P>
<P>
	They say his arm is too weak to throw the 15-yard out pattern or  
the deep ball. He's too slow, they insist. And wait a minute, who 
did the guy ever beat in college anyway? 
</P>
<P>
	Couch has heard it all.  
</P>
<P>
	``Year in and year out this happens to all the top guys,'' the  
Kentucky quarterback said. ``Everybody finds something wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard to find many flaws in Couch's game. After all, he set  
26 school passing records, 12 Southeastern Conference and four NCAA 
marks. He completed 400 of 553 passes for 4,275 yards and 36 
touchdowns as a senior with the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are those who think he's not worthy of being the  
No. 1 selection in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	But on March 11, Couch plans to answer the questions about his  
arm by showing it off for the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely going to try to persuade them I'm the guy to  
take, but it's really going to depend on my workout,'' he said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch was in town to be honored as the Cleveland Touchdown  
Club's 1998 college player of the year. It was merely coincidence, 
but Couch holding his award during an afternoon news conference 
with a brown and orange banner complete with Browns helmet and the 
initials TC was kind of funny. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, this is not my last trip to Cleveland,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Couch is on his way to Indianapolis for this week's NFL scouting  
combine. However, he won't be displaying his talents for teams to 
evaluate and will only undergo a physical. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he'll wait until next month to prove to the Browns he  
should be their quarterback of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been plotting his strategy for the Browns' brass like he  
used to prepare for facing Alabama's defense. Using four Wildcats 
wide receivers, including Craig Yeast, a potential high-round draft 
pick himself, Couch plans to throw everything he's got at Browns 
coach Chris Palmer, football operations director Dwight Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go out and try and put on a good show for  
them,'' Couch said. ``I'll try and show them exactly what they want 
to see. We've been going over our game plan like we're preparing 
for a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The knock on Couch is his arm strength. He rarely got a chance  
to throw deep while at Kentucky, but he's sure he can air it out 
far enough to play in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if you can throw the ball accurately 55 yards on a  
deep post and you throw it on time, I think that's as far as you'll 
have to throw it,'' he said. ``Except on Hail Mary's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch knows the Browns could decide to take Texas running back  
Ricky Williams with the top pick, or they could trade the 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always a chance that could happen,'' he said. ``A lot  
can happen between now and April 17. I'm going to have to wait this 
out, but hopefully I'll persuade them to take me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch said he's been monitoring the Browns rebirth, and has been  
impressed with what the expansion team has done so far. He was 
glued to the TV on the day of the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh yeah, I watched all that,'' he said. ``I think it's been  
great. ``They've already got a really good offensive line in 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns have been shopping for a veteran quarterback, and  
could be bringing in 42-year-old Warren Moon for a visit next week. 
Couch understands that spending a year as an understudy could be 
helpful. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they do bring in a veteran, it can do nothing but help  
me,'' he said. ``But just for competition, I'd like to be on the 
field and learn on the run. But if they want me to sit, that would 
be fine.''

<HEADLINE> Child, Man Die After Fall Into Pond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE ARROWHEAD, Calif. (AP) -- A 7-year-old boy who plunged  
through the frozen surface of a pond and a man who tried to rescue 
him died after being submerged for nearly three hours Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 7-year-old broke through the ice, fell into it and the  
27-year-old attempted to rescue him,'' said San Bernardino County 
sheriff's Capt. Dennis Casey. ``Unfortunately, the rescue efforts 
failed and both of them went down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was pronounced dead at the pond about 6 p.m. Attempts to  
revive the man at a Lake Arrowhead hospital failed and he died two 
hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone called 911 about 3:30 p.m. to report that the two had  
fallen into the pond, said Chip Patterson, a sheriff's spokesman. 
Crews in inflatable boats dragged grappling hooks along the bottom 
of the pond and divers swam through the icy water searching for the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake Arrowhead, in the San Bernardino Mountains, is about 70  
miles east of Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Law May Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Independent Counsel Act has problems and  
needs some changes, says Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, who 
is supervising the Justice Department's review of the 
Watergate-inspired law. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a statute that has some problems and needs some work, I  
think at a minimum,'' Holder told a news conference Thursday. With 
the law's expiration this summer, ``we have an opportunity ... at a 
minimum, to tinker with it,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder would not identify either the problems he sees or the  
changes he wants. But his boss, Attorney General Janet Reno, has 
suggested several times that an amendment is needed to force 
independent counsels to live within budgets, like all other 
government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice study group that Holder heads is reviewing the  
experience with the law and will make recommendations to Reno in a 
week to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, I don't think I can safely say that anything  
has been ruled out'' as a possible administration position, Holder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've considered ... everything from having the act repassed  
in its present form to simply letting it lapse, and we've 
considered everything in between,'' Holder said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration likely will agree on a formal  
recommendation either before Holder testifies about the act to a 
House subcommittee next week or before Reno appears in mid-March at 
a Senate committee hearing on it, Holder added. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of that panel, recently  
predicted the law's demise. That largely is because of Republican 
anger over Reno's refusal to have an independent counsel take over 
the Justice Department investigation of campaign financing during 
the 1996 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has named seven independent counsels to investigate top  
administration officials over 10 different matters -- more than any 
of her predecessors. Some Justice officials have been dismayed by 
what they consider overreaching by some of these counsels. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats in Congress, angered over the conduct of counsel  
Kenneth Starr's investigation of Clinton, have urged limiting or 
even killing the act. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bar Association, long a supporter of the law,  
recently voted to recommend its demise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has informed Starr that it intends to  
open an investigation of his dealings with former White House 
intern Monica Lewinsky, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other issues, the investigation will examine allegations  
that Starr's deputies broke department rules by offering her 
immunity on condition she not discuss it with her attorney and that 
Starr and his aides may have had contacts with lawyers for Paula 
Jones, who was suing Clinton for sexual harassment, that were not 
disclosed when he obtained Reno's approval to investigate the 
Lewinsky case, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has defended his office's conduct and argued that any such  
inquiry should be conducted by an outsider rather than the 
department's internal watchdog agency, the Office of Professional 
Responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder refused to confirm any investigation of Starr.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't want to comment on whether or not we are doing an  
investigation, where we stand in making that decision, but we would 
leave all of our options open as to who might do such an 
investigation if one were to be done,'' Holder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other department officials, requesting anonymity, said Reno has  
ordered Justice Inspector General Michael Browmich to investigate 
how word of the intended inquiry on Starr leaked to the news media.

<HEADLINE>  QB Couch Has Heard Critics Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Tim Couch's has heard the critics.  
</P>
<P>
	They say his arm is too weak to throw the 15-yard out pattern or  
the deep ball. He's too slow, they insist. And wait a minute, who 
did the guy ever beat in college anyway? 
</P>
<P>
	Couch has heard it all.  
</P>
<P>
	``Year in and year out this happens to all the top guys,'' the  
Kentucky quarterback said. ``Everybody finds something wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard to find many flaws in Couch's game. After all, he set  
26 school passing records, 12 Southeastern Conference and four NCAA 
marks. He completed 400 of 553 passes for 4,275 yards and 36 
touchdowns as a senior with the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are those who think he's not worthy of being the  
No. 1 selection in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	But on March 11, Couch plans to answer the questions about his  
arm by showing it off for the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely going to try to persuade them I'm the guy to  
take, but it's really going to depend on my workout,'' he said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch was in town to be honored as the Cleveland Touchdown  
Club's 1998 college player of the year. It was merely coincidence, 
but Couch holding his award during an afternoon news conference 
with a brown and orange banner complete with Browns helmet and the 
initials TC was kind of funny. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, this is not my last trip to Cleveland,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Couch is on his way to Indianapolis for this week's NFL scouting  
combine. However, he won't be displaying his talents for teams to 
evaluate and will only undergo a physical. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he'll wait until next month to prove to the Browns he  
should be their quarterback of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been plotting his strategy for the Browns' brass like he  
used to prepare for facing Alabama's defense. Using four Wildcats 
wide receivers, including Craig Yeast, a potential high-round draft 
pick himself, Couch plans to throw everything he's got at Browns 
coach Chris Palmer, football operations director Dwight Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go out and try and put on a good show for  
them,'' Couch said. ``I'll try and show them exactly what they want 
to see. We've been going over our game plan like we're preparing 
for a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The knock on Couch is his arm strength. He rarely got a chance  
to throw deep while at Kentucky, but he's sure he can air it out 
far enough to play in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if you can throw the ball accurately 55 yards on a  
deep post and you throw it on time, I think that's as far as you'll 
have to throw it,'' he said. ``Except on Hail Mary's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch knows the Browns could decide to take Texas running back  
Ricky Williams with the top pick, or they could trade the 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always a chance that could happen,'' he said. ``A lot  
can happen between now and April 17. I'm going to have to wait this 
out, but hopefully I'll persuade them to take me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch said he's been monitoring the Browns rebirth, and has been  
impressed with what the expansion team has done so far. He was 
glued to the TV on the day of the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh yeah, I watched all that,'' he said. ``I think it's been  
great. ``They've already got a really good offensive line in 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns have been shopping for a veteran quarterback, and  
could be bringing in 42-year-old Warren Moon for a visit next week. 
Couch understands that spending a year as an understudy could be 
helpful. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they do bring in a veteran, it can do nothing but help  
me,'' he said. ``But just for competition, I'd like to be on the 
field and learn on the run. But if they want me to sit, that would 
be fine.''

<HEADLINE> Maryland Custody Case Reconsidered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Maryland's highest court has overturned a  
ruling that gave a woman who admitted killing her infant daughter 
custody of her son. 
</P>
<P>
	The Court of Appeals on Wednesday ordered the case back to  
Circuit Court Judge Michael Mason to determine whether the boy is 
in danger of abuse if returned to his mother, 25-year-old Latrena 
Pixley. 
</P>
<P>
	``A parent, after all, has no right, fundamental or otherwise,  
to abuse or neglect his or her children,'' Judge Alan Wilner wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Mason could still return the boy to his mother if he determines  
there is no likelihood she will abuse the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Mason's original decision that the boy would be better off with  
his mother sparked public outrage. 
</P>
<P>
	It contributed to the General Assembly's decision last year to  
pass a law specifying that courts must put the best interest of a 
child ahead of parental rights in making custody decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pixley pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for smothering  
her 6-month-old daughter, Nakya Dannyell Scott, and dumping her 
body in the trash in 1992. A defense psychiatrist testified that 
she was suffering from postpartum depression at the time, and she 
was sentenced to probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Ms. Pixley have argued that she has turned her  
life around and has a strong bond with her 3-year-old son 
Cornilous, who been cared for by a foster mother since he was a 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pixley's lawyer, Ralph Hall, said she looked forward to  
proving her ability to raise the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is disappointed that the decision went this way,'' Hall  
said.

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At age 16, Elizabeth Katz is already thinking  
about what it means to be a religious Jew in a secular culture. 
There are the obvious tensions, such as whether to wear pants or 
the long skirts favored in Orthodox circles. The larger question, 
she says, is whether to remain sheltered in a community of Orthodox 
Jews or venture into the larger society, with its richness and 
temptations. 
</P>
<P>
	She has made her choices: Jewish schools and secular movies, and  
modest skirts in an immodest world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy to seclude yourself in being religious and go off to  
the right with no contact with the outside,'' she says. The 
challenge, she thinks, is to be modern and Orthodox. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz was among 1,500 people confronting that challenge at a  
recent two-day conference in New York, ``Orthodoxy Encounters a 
Changing World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How can modern Orthodox Jews interact socially, intellectually  
and professionally with society at large while safeguarding their 
religious life from secular values? How can they draw on elements 
of that culture that they believe in, such as a commitment to 
women's religious education, until recently not a priority in 
Orthodox circles? How can they apply Jewish ethical teachings to 
society's problems? 
</P>
<P>
	The smallest of the religion's three main branches in the United  
States, Orthodox Judaism espouses adherence to Jewish law it 
believes was divinely revealed. Israel's ultra-Orthodox Jews or 
haredim (``those who tremble'' before the Lord) dominate the news 
with their efforts to impose their stringent interpretation of that 
law on others. But Orthodoxy encompasses a broad range of views on 
how to understand Jewish law in a modern context. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference was a homecoming for religious Jews who have long  
been concerned with such controversial issues as the leadership 
role of Jewish women, religion and democracy in Israel, and 
attitudes toward the non-Orthodox, at a time of growing 
conservatism within the Orthodox movement. ``When I walked in I 
thought, 'Oh wow, I'm not alone,' '' said Ivy Schwartz, a former 
Jewish educator from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But to critics like Yeshiva University professor Rabbi Moshe  
Tendler, conference organizers were ``outside the pale of Judaism'' 
and ``ignorant of Jewish law,'' as he said to The New York Jewish 
Week. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a familiar but unfounded charge that modern means less  
observant, countered Rabbi Saul Berman, director of Edah (Hebrew 
for ``community''), the 2-year-old New York-based group that 
sponsored the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	``We who have chosen the more difficult path of the  
integrationist approach are no less Orthodox than our brethren,'' 
says Berman, professor of Jewish Studies at Yeshiva University's 
Stern College for Women. ``We may not for a moment yield to anyone 
our powerful commitment to halacha'' (Jewish law). 
</P>
<P>
	Many women and an increasing number of men say that an  
integrationist approach to the modern world has led them to support 
expanding women's roles within the confines of that law. Women's 
prayer groups, once considered a radical idea, are gaining 
acceptance in many Orthodox synagogues. More women are celebrating 
the birth of their daughters with baby-naming ceremonies and saying 
kaddish at the death of their parents; only male versions of those 
rituals existed before. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to leadership, Orthodox Jews are discussing in  
what situations women should be permitted to offer rulings on 
applications of Jewish law. Three women are serving as 
congregational interns, responsible for education and pastoral 
care, in two New York synagogues and one in Chicago. And a few 
Orthodox feminists are calling for women's ordination. 
</P>
<P>
	In such an atmosphere, Lisa Lehmann, 34, a fellow in medical  
ethics at Harvard Medical School, barely caused a stir at the 
conference when she swayed back and forth during morning communal 
prayer in the Grand Hyatt hotel ballroom, the only woman wearing a 
yarmulke, shawl, and tefillin, two boxes containing scrolls with 
Biblical messages bound to her with leather straps. Usually, such 
prayers are for men only. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she wanted to intensify her religious expression, and  
the conference seemed an accepting environment. She does not wear 
tefillin at her synagogue for fear of offending. 
</P>
<P>
	Reinforcing such values as tolerance, some adherents argue,  
requires a new generation of prayer books and institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Modern Orthodoxy needs a new rabbinical school committed to  
combining the best in Jewish scholarship with the best in Western 
cultural studies and progressive thinking, argued Rabbi Daniel 
Lehmann, headmaster of the New Jewish School of Greater Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	His alma mater, Yeshiva University, has long been recognized as  
an institution that synthesizes traditional Jewish values and 
modern culture. But Lehmann called it ``a generation behind 
intellectually,'' lacking departments in such fields as comparative 
religions and anthropology. Others at the conference defended 
Yeshiva. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to be honest,'' Lehmann said. ``We are the left of  
Orthodoxy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such talk reflected just the environment that conference  
organizers tried to foster: where subjects once considered 
off-limits could be discussed with civility and a diversity of 
opinion could be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody here will label you as outside the pale of Orthodoxy  
for daring to ask questions,'' says Judy Adler Sheer, executive 
director of Edah, ``for expressing your opinions and admitting that 
you're struggling with issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen-year-old Shifra Landowne welcomes the struggle. ``I'll  
be facing these issues for the rest of my life, '' she says. ``How 
to be a modern Orthodox woman.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prepares for Serbia Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dramatizing a threat to bomb the Serbs, the  
Clinton administration is adding 51 U.S. warplanes to an already 
powerful attack force in Europe to pressure the Yugoslav government 
to approve a self-rule plan for Kosovo and to accept NATO 
peacekeeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be in a position to carry out an air operation,  
should it be requested,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said on 
his arrival early this morning in Seattle on unrelated business. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen told reporters the additional planes -- 12 Air Force F-117  
stealth fighter-bombers, 10 EA-6B electronic warfare planes and 29 
refueling planes -- would begin arriving in Europe this weekend. He 
said they would be ready for a possible attack by the middle of 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen declined to say where in Europe the extra planes would be  
based. Aviano air base in Italy is one possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The purpose of sending more warplanes is to heighten the threat  
of force and thereby intimidate Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic into accepting a six-nation plan to end a yearlong 
conflict between Serb troops and secession-minded ethnic Albanians 
in Kosovo, a province in the dominant Yugoslav state of Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Milosevic has defied the United States and five allied  
governments who have given him until noon Saturday to agree to pull 
most Serb troops out of Kosovo and see them replaced by some 28,000 
NATO peacekeepers, including about 4,000 U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
	While his Serb negotiators at Rambouillet, France, are showing  
some interest in the self-rule plan for the Albanian-majority 
Serbian province, Milosevic is defying the United States and its 
partners on the peacekeeping operation that would clear the way for 
a local police force to take charge in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now the Kosovars appear to be willing to sit down and  
negotiate some kind of agreement,'' Cohen said. ``He (Milosevich) 
does not at this point. So we are going to put the forces in place 
to at least prepare for taking action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in Washington Cohen warned that the Serbs faced ``swift  
and severe'' consequences'' if they persisted in rejecting a NATO 
peacekeeping force in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Demanding that Milosevic change his mind by noon Saturday, James  
P. Foley, the State Department's deputy spokesman, said: ``If it 
would take some military action to force Mr. Milosevic to his 
senses, so be it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen's order directs that the planes depart U.S. bases within  
the next 48 hours. The dozen F-117s will depart from Holloman Air 
Force Base, N.M. Five of the 10 EA-6B planes are at Whidbey Naval 
Air Station, Wash., and five are at Cherry Point Marine Corps Air 
Station, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The additional planes bring to 260 the number of U.S. aircraft  
that would be available for any NATO strikes against Serbia, Cohen 
said. Additional U.S. aircraft, including bombers, have been 
ordered to a standby position in case they are needed, he added. 
Cohen said B-52s and possibly B-2 stealth bombers could be called 
into action for the attacks, which also could involve hundreds of 
planes from other NATO countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The tactic is similar to the military pressure applied against  
Iraq last year to try to wear down President Saddam Hussein into 
permitting unfettered U.N. inspections of suspect weapons sites. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana has had authority since  
Jan. 30 to order airstrikes against the Serbs and is not required 
to consult alliance members again, Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a practical matter,'' however, Solana probably would talk  
to the United States and possibly other allies before ordering any 
bombardment, the U.S. spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration took the tough line after Milosevic  
was approached in Belgrade and rejected a NATO peacekeeping force 
in Kosovo as part of a settlement to end conflict between Serb 
troops and ethnic Albanians seeking to pry the province away from 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, unable to sway Milosevic  
in a telephone call Tuesday, is weighing a decision whether to 
intervene in the negotiations again. 
</P>
<P>
	She and five foreign ministers set the deadline last weekend in  
Paris, but the Serbs have not budged on their opposition to NATO 
peacekeepers being sent to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley said the door remains open for Milosevic to yield to the  
demands of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and 
Russia. Together the six nations comprise the so-called Contact 
Group that oversees the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not see the issue as closed,'' he said. ``President  
Milosevic still has time to see the light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Foley said some progress in the negotiations has been made  
on other issues, and lawyers are working on texts of an accord to 
end the yearlong Kosovo conflict that has claimed 2,000 lives and 
routed some 300,000 people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Serb side is dealing with the prospect of a peace  
agreement,'' the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Milosevic's defiant ``no'' on NATO peacekeepers, the  
British and French foreign ministers also detected some progress. 
</P>
<P>
	And Vuk Draskovic, the Serbian deputy prime minister, said the  
Serbs would accept a ``just agreement'' provided it eased economic 
and political sanctions on Yugoslavia, such as a ban on its 
participation in international financial organizations.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Public Lukewarm to Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite strong support among loyal Republicans  
for a tax cut, pivotal ticket-splitting voters are ``closer to 
Democrats'' when it comes to proposals for allocating the federal 
budget surplus, according to a confidential survey taken for the 
Senate GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``On paying down the debt they are closer to us than to the  
Democrats,'' says the survey, which was taken last November and 
distributed to GOP senators just as President Clinton's impeachment 
trial was getting under way. ``To expand beyond the base of 
Republican tax cutters, we need to stress debt reduction and Social 
Security,'' it concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was taken by Voter Consumer Research, a Bethesda,  
Md., polling company, to help Senate Republicans chart a 
legislative course for this year that would ``put Democrats on the 
defensive.'' Another purpose was to generate appeal among 
ticket-splitters who are likely to play a pivotal role in the 2000 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP survey was taken in the wake of elections that were  
disappointing for Republicans -- a loss of seats in the House and no 
net change in the Senate. The survey, along with an accompanying 
memo by Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, chairman of the GOP 
Senate campaign committee, was distributed about a month ago, as 
lawmakers struggled with Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the Republican leadership seems to be taking heed from  
the survey data. While voter concern about defense issues does not 
rank high, there is strong support for improving the pay of 
personnel. Thus, legislation to grant a pay increase for the armed 
forces is expected to be on the Senate floor as soon as lawmakers 
return from their current recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the cautionary note about tax cuts, the survey says it  
is ``one of the very few issues that is still truly our issue'' and 
must be a key part of any agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi traveled to Michigan  
late last week to stress support for a tax cut, and Rep. John 
Kasich of Ohio, a presidential hopeful, favors a 10 percent 
across-the-board reduction in income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Clinton favors targeted tax cuts that would be less  
costly, and emphasizes the need to shore up Social Security. ``Will 
our first priority be spending the budget surplus that we have 
worked so hard to create on a terrifically appealing tax cut in the 
moment, or will our first priority be investing whatever the 
necessary amount of the surplus is for at least the next 15 years 
to strengthen Social Security and Medicare,'' he said Wednesday in 
comments beamed nationwide to students. 
</P>
<P>
	In his memo, McConnell wrote that Social Security, tax cuts and  
education should be the three issues to focus on for the coming 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	On taxes, he wrote, ``Here is our dilemma in a nutshell: a  
plurality of Republican voters rated tax cuts as the highest 
priority for dividing up the surplus, but among ticket-splitters, 
tax cuts were the least popular choice.'' Preserving Social 
Security ranked the highest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell said Republicans must push for tax cuts for several  
reasons, saying it is the only issue that holds the Republican 
electoral base together. ``Sad to say, it is just about the only 
issue that people uniformly cite as a reason to vote Republican,'' 
McConnell wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said, ``We should be under no illusion that  
there is steadfast support for tax cuts outside of our base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When all voters in the survey were asked about allocating the  
surplus, 27 percent said spend more on education, health care and 
the environment, 26 percent said shore up Social Security, 23 
percent said enact cut taxes, and 20 percent said pay down the 
national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also offered a few postscripts on the last election  
that were discouraging for Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the issues on which Americans look to Republicans for  
leadership -- taxes, defense and the budget -- are in the bottom half 
of the list of priority issues. In addition, moral issues, which 
Republicans had counted on to help them at the polls, ``played a 
relatively minor role'' when voters made their decisions at the 
ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
	House elections rated only a footnote in the Senate survey.  
</P>
<P>
	But it said the costly television advertising campaign that  
touched on impeachment had backfired. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did not motivate the Republican base voter, who was already  
motivated,'' the survey said. ``It did anger Democrats and 
motivated them more.''

<HEADLINE> Taxes Are Taking More Time Than Ever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It takes more than 22 hours for a taxpayer who  
itemizes deductions and has some investment income to finish this 
year's required Internal Revenue Service forms, the tax agency 
estimates. That's three hours longer than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. tax code now stands at more than 1.5 million words and  
climbing thanks to 1,260 changes enacted by Congress and signed by 
President Clinton in the last two years alone. 
</P>
<P>
	For this year's filing season, the IRS had to develop 11 new  
forms and revise 177 others. 
</P>
<P>
	All this has happened at a time when the same politicians voting  
for the changes are advocating tax simplification. Make the code 
simple enough that returns for most Americans would be the size of 
a postcard, say flat tax advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	But for millions of taxpayers trying to do their taxes by April  
15, the complexity is so daunting they are almost forced to seek 
professional help or a computer software program. A new ad campaign 
by H&AMP;R Block sums up the fear factor: ``We Know. Do You?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major culprit is the trend in the Clinton administration and  
Congress to enact tax credits for various social needs and to 
tinker with such intricate areas as taxes on capital gains from 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time there's a new benefit, it requires an additional  
line to the form and additional forms to compute those credits,'' 
said Sheldon Schwartz, national tax forms and publications director 
at IRS. ``It's never as easy as we would like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for politicians, the appeal of a tax break far outweighs  
such worries. 
</P>
<P>
	``People will push the complexity into the background,'' said  
Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., a senior member of the tax-writing House 
Ways and Means Committee. ``The credits are politically expedient 
and attractive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, some taxpayers for the first time can get a $400  
credit for children under age 17 and two education credits -- the 
Hope and Lifetime Learning credits -- that provide up to $1,500 and 
$1,000 respectively for certain postsecondary education expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds relatively simple. But taxpayers claiming the child  
credit must complete an 11-line worksheet, and depending on the 
answers, a second 10-line form to determine if they qualify under 
the income limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The education credits require completion of an 18-line form and  
come with their own book of instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	Another area of difficulty is IRS Schedule D, where investors  
must report their capital gains or losses from investments. Even 
small-scale investors must fill out the 54-line form and navigate 
its confusing maze of tax rates for different investments -- which 
changed dramatically in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Most forbidding of all is the alternative minimum tax. Intended  
to prevent the wealthy from escaping taxes through deductions and 
credits, it now threatens more and more middle-class taxpayers 
because its thresholds were never indexed for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	This means millions of taxpayers could be required to calculate  
both their regular taxes and their alternative minimum taxes -- and 
pay the higher of the two. That means completing a 12-line IRS 
worksheet to determine if a taxpayer is affected by the alternative 
tax and then a 50-line form to figure out the amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who mistakenly believe the alternative tax doesn't apply  
to them could get an unwelcome surprise from the IRS if they don't 
do both calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	For accountants, tax software firms and preparers such as H&AMP;R  
Block, this uncertainty means big business. The Block ``We Know'' 
ad campaign is aimed at giving people confidence that their taxes 
are being done right, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it really means is there are more opportunities to save  
money,'' said Linda McDougal of the Kansas City-based firm, which 
last year did one-seventh of all individual income tax returns. 
``To take advantage, you may need the help of a tax professional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leading tax software, TurboTax from San Diego-based Intuit  
Inc., sold 3.3 million copies last year. Buyers ``are looking to a 
trusted source for advice and to help them do their taxes,'' said 
Monica Muilenburg, director of product marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite talk in Congress of simplification, it doesn't appear  
likely anytime soon. Clinton's new budget proposes numerous credits 
for such things as care for the elderly and disabled, stay-at-home 
parents and disabled workers. Some have Republican support. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Rep. William Coyne, D-Pa., plans to introduce  
legislation that would replace the capital gains form with a single 
line and would count investment earnings as regular income. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Services estimates it will take a taxpayer  
an average of 22.7 hours to complete the 1040 form, Schedule A for 
itemized deductions and Schedule D for capital gains and losses. 
Last year, those forms took an average of 19.5 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's how the IRS figures this year's burden:  

</P>
<P>
 *Form 1040    	
</P>
<P>
	Record keeping: 3 hours, 34 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Bypass Drug Study Disappoints Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A drug heralded last year as a promising  
alternative to heart surgery has proven disappointing, scientists 
at the biotechnology firm that developed it said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech Inc. had developed a growth hormone it hoped would  
enable people with chest pain to grow their own bypasses, tiny 
blood vessels in the heart that normally are substituted through 
grafting or angioplasty. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes two weeks before findings of a clinical  
trial are scheduled to be presented at the American College of 
Cardiology conference in New Orleans. Clinical trial results 
usually are not made public outside of a medical conference or 
journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials had not decided whether to continue the study  
involving 178 people across the country, Genentech spokesman Paul 
Laland said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt it was important to get the information out quickly,''  
Laland said, insisting that the timing of the announcement was not 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Timothy D. Henry, the University of Minnesota researcher  
directing the trial for Genentech, said he was perplexed by the 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the first glance is disappointing, it will affect the stock  
market,'' Henry said. ``So perhaps they wanted to soften that.'' 
But, he added, ``you shouldn't say anything until you've looked at 
all the data and presented'' it at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers hoped that genetically engineered vascular  
endothelial growth factor, or VEGF (pronounced vedge-EFF), would 
allow patients with angina who could not be treated by angioplasty 
or bypass surgery to exercise beyond their initial capability with 
less or no chest pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's announcement was based on 60 days of testing.  
</P>
<P>
	Laland would not elaborate on why Dr. Susan Hellman, Genentech's  
senior vice president, said she was ``disappointed in the 
preliminary view of the data,'' other than to say that the company 
was reviewing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry said he had not reviewed all the data and that he would  
not necessarily call it disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone would like you to hit a home run, but the first time  
you step up to the plate that's not how it works,'' Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first stage of the trial presented at last year's  
conference, the treatment eased angina in 13 of the 15 people 
treated. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1 million Americans a year undergo either bypass or  
angioplasty. 
</P>
<P>
	A bypass involves grafting tiny pieces of blood vessel onto the  
heart to shuttle blood around blocked sections of artery. 
Angioplasty uses a tiny balloon, threaded into the heart, to 
squeeze open narrowed passages temporarily.

<HEADLINE> Miami-Dade OKs Indian Site Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Commissioners of Miami-Dade County have decided to  
go to court to take over a riverfront site where a developer wants 
to remove 500- to 700-year-old Indian ruins to make way for 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioners voted 10-1 on Thursday to ask a judge to allow  
them to seize the 2.2-acre site from developer Michael Baumann 
through eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather be on the side of preserving history than on the  
side of destroying history,'' Mayor Alex Penelas said. ``I think 
the history books will demonstrate that this is a government with a 
lot of courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City leaders would like the 38-foot-wide stone circle left as is  
instead of being moved or forced to share the site with waterfront 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
	Archaeologists say the ruins could be part of a ceremonial  
temple built by the Tequesta, a tribe of about 10,000 Indians who 
lived in the area before war and disease wiped them out in the 
1500s. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify for an eminent domain ruling, the county would have  
to prove the site serves a public interest. If the county 
successfully makes its case, a judge would authorize seizure. The 
price would be determined by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Penelas said the commission would meet again next week to  
examine how to fund a takeover. Baumann bought the land for $8 
million last year, but he considers it worth $50 million because he 
has the permits to build his planned twin apartment towers. 
</P>
<P>
	Baumann has said he will only consider a ``quick taking'' by the  
county that would give him compensation as if the complex were 
completed.

<HEADLINE> Mandatory Hepatitis Shots Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A federal health group wants 11 Western states  
with a high incidence of hepatitis A to require that children be 
vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
	Children are one of the highest risk groups for hepatitis A, the  
Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's advisory 
committee on immunization said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee recommended that states with at least 20 cases out  
of every 100,000 people -- twice the national average for hepatitis 
A cases between 1987 and 1997 -- implement routine vaccinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Those states currently are Arizona, Alaska, California, Idaho,  
Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vaccinating children against hepatitis A is one of the most  
effective -- and cost-effective -- strategies for building long-term 
immunity against hepatitis A and preventing further spread of the 
disease,'' said Thelma King Thiel, chairman and chief executive of 
the Hepatitis Foundation International in Cedar Grove, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Hepatitis A, a highly contagious virus that affects the liver,  
is spread by personal contact when hands aren't washed after 
bathroom use or by contaminated food or water. It infects as many 
as 200,000 Americans and costs the nation more than $450 million 
annually, the foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
	Primary symptoms include jaundice, fatigue, flu-like illness  
with high fever, chills, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 30 percent of those cases occur in children 15 or  
younger. 
</P>
<P>
	Children do not always exhibit symptoms of hepatitis A, but can  
transmit it to adults who tend to develop more severe symptoms.

<HEADLINE> FAA Mulls Standards for Carry-Ons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Federal regulators are thinking about  
setting uniform standards for carry-on bags. In the meantime, 
they're giving out brochures asking travelers to ``Think Small, 
Think Smart, Think Safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign, unveiled Thursday at a luggage industry show, is a  
joint effort by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Luggage 
&AMP; Leather Goods Manufacturers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal ... is to prepare passengers to be better air  
travelers,'' said Anne DeCicco, president of the luggage group. 
</P>
<P>
	The Association of Flight Attendants and the luggage  
manufacturers' group say 4,000 passengers and crew members are hurt 
each year by bags and objects falling from overhead bins. 
</P>
<P>
	They claim carry-on bag standards would improve safety and  
eliminate problems for passengers who switch airlines during a 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA requires airlines to develop carry-on policies but  
leaves the details to them. As a result, the number and size of 
bags a passenger can carry aboard vary from airline to airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Most major carriers limit carry-on bags to 9 inches tall, 14  
inches deep and 22 inches wide. But the carriers are divided on 
adopting a uniform standard. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA is considering imposing uniform standard but will likely  
wait to see whether the public awareness campaign is successful, 
said Kathryn Creedy, a spokeswoman for the agency.

<HEADLINE> General Dynamics Bids for Shipyard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Defense contractor General Dynamics Corp.  
on Thursday made an unsolicited $1.36 billion cash bid for Newport 
News Shipbuilding Inc., though shipyard officials questioned 
whether the deal would survive an antitrust review. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer also could throw a kink into the planned $470 million  
merger announced last month between the Virginia shipyard and New 
Orleans-based Avondale Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid of $38.50 a share represents a 35 percent premium above  
Newport News' closing stock price Thursday of $28.43 3/4 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	William P. Fricks, chairman and chief executive officer of  
Newport News Shipbuilding, said the proposal ``requires a careful 
assessment of the antitrust risk and reliable assurance that it is 
unlikely to be a problem. Under present circumstances, we view this 
as requiring a finding by the Department of Defense that there is a 
reasonable likelihood of approval.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale officials said they remained strongly committed to  
their deal with the Virginia shipyard and suggested that a General 
Dynamics-Newport News deal would destroy the merger announced last 
month that would create a company capable of producing any type of 
U.S. warship. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the General Dynamics letter did not specifically ask  
Newport News to terminate its agreement with Avondale, the letter 
states that Newport News' proposed acquisition of Avondale would 
create antitrust problems in a combination of General Dynamics and 
Newport News,'' Avondale said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding officials also noted that the terms of  
the merger with Avondale do not allow consideration of another 
offer unless the shipyard's board determines the new offer is 
superior to the Avondale deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll, deputy director of the  
Washington-based Center for Defense Information, a Pentagon 
watchdog group, said the General Dynamics offer reflects ongoing 
defense industry consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting to the point where there will be no competition  
left,'' Carroll said. ``... It seems to me that when you swallow up 
Newport News, you really take all the opportunity for true 
competition away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Nicholas D. Chabraja, chairman and CEO of General Dynamics,  
defended the takeover proposal as good for shareholders and 
employees of both companies and the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the transaction will receive the required  
regulatory approvals because the combination of our companies would 
not adversely affect competition in the industry,'' Chabraja said. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics, headquartered in Falls Church, Va., is one of  
the nation's leading defense contractors with 33,000 employees in 
the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics owns Electric Boat, for years Newport News  
Shipbuilding's chief rival in building submarines, as well as Bath 
Iron Works and National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. Last year, the 
company that also makes the M1 Abrams battle tank earned $364 
million, or $2.86 per share, on sales of $4.97 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding, with 18,000 employees, earned $66  
million, or $1.85 per share, on revenue of $1.86 billion last year. 
The company builds all the Navy's aircraft carriers and many of its 
submarines. It also repairs and performs maintenance on various 
types of Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale, with 6,000 employees, earned $36.9 million, or $2.82  
per share, in 1998. Annual revenue was $748.9 million. Avondale 
designs, builds and overhauls Navy surface ships as well as 
commercial vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the offer came after financial markets closed Thursday.  
Shares of Avondale rose 43 3/4 cents to $32.68 3/4 in trading on the 
Nasdaq market, while shares of General Dynamics closed at $60.06 1/4, 
up $1.93 3/4, in trading on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding was a division of Tenneco Inc. until  
December 1996, when it became an independent company.

<HEADLINE> Defense Secretary Visits Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- In a campaign to bolster popular support  
for the U.S. military, Defense Secretary William Cohen said 
Thursday that America's information technology industry owes its 
world dominance in part to the military's global power. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some in the `digital world' dismiss the importance of the  
national security world,'' Cohen told about 200 Microsoft employees 
in a speech on the software giant's campus in suburban Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Company chairman Bill Gates, seated behind Cohen, cracked a thin  
smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some soldiers in the high-tech revolution do not fully  
understand or appreciate the soldiers in camouflage,'' Cohen said. 
They think ``that tanks and guns are somehow rusty relics of the 
past, nearly obsolete in the new information-based world that is 
going to carry us into the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said Microsoft, whose biggest customer is the Defense  
Department, has a healthy appreciation of the importance of 
American military power. But he complained about an unidentified 
industry official whose dismissive remark he had read in The New 
York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	He quoted the official as saying, ``Money is extracted from  
Silicon Valley and then wasted by Washington.'' Cohen said this 
attitude revealed a troubling lack of understanding of how the U.S. 
military's presence and influence abroad helps the American 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indeed, peace and stability are the very cornerstones of  
prosperity,'' Cohen said. ``When our diplomats and military forces 
work together to help create stability and security in a nation or 
a region, that same stability and security attracts investment. 
Investment, in turn, generates prosperity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Introducing Cohen, Gates enthusiastically welcomed him as  
representing ``our biggest customer in the world.'' The Pentagon, 
whose network of more than 2.1 million computers is central to its 
military missions, buys $300 million a year in Microsoft products. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates said Microsoft is intent on working with the Defense  
Department to improve the security of its information from the 
threat of cyberterrorism. ``It's fair to say this is an unsolved 
problem,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening remarks Cohen noted how unusual it is for a  
defense secretary to visit a company like Microsoft. He noted that 
the usual itinerary for a visit to the Seattle area would center on 
a tour of Boeing Co., which ranks as the nation's No. 2 defense 
contractor. In fact Cohen did visit Boeing, then flew to 
Microsoft's campus by Army helicopter, an entrance that he said 
jokingly may have surprised and unsettled some workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably thought this is `Red Dawn,''' referring to the  
1980s movie about a foreign army's invasion of the United States, 
``or an invasion of the aliens,'' Cohen said to laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the second in a series of appearances by Cohen before  
Americans outside the traditional circle of audiences for a 
Pentagon chief. Last month, he spoke to the Illinois General 
Assembly in Springfield, and he is considering speeches this year 
to the Kansas City Board of Trade, at New Orleans' City Hall and to 
the Arkansas state legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	As he did in his Springfield appearance, Cohen told his  
Microsoft audience that the nation needs to show its support for 
those in uniform and to invest more in its high-tech future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must invest in the next generation of weapons and  
technology if we are to maintain our ability to shape and respond 
to world events in the 21st century,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In that vein, the Clinton administration is proposing to spend  
an extra $112 billion on the military over the next six years. It 
would be the first sustained increase since the big military 
buildup of the early 1980s, and some critics have questioned 
whether the added investment is worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as software that only a few years ago was  
state-of-the-art is now nearly antiquated, so will our military 
lose its dominant edge without significant investment,'' Cohen 
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton in N.H. To Push Tax Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, N.H. (AP) -- In the first political trip of his  
post-impeachment era, President Clinton pushed his plan for 
targeted tax cuts and saving Social Security and reminisced with 
New Hampshire Democrats about how they revived his candidacy in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton hosted a roundtable discussion Thursday with Gov. Jeanne  
Shaheen and people whose health care hardships illustrate what some 
of his budget proposals -- particularly a $1,000 tax credit for 
long-term care -- are designed to remedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The health care tax credits are paid for within Clinton's  
balanced budget proposal. The administration is promoting them as 
an alternative to the Republicans' plan to use the budget surplus 
to pay for a 10 percent tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will hear all kinds of debates in the next year about what  
to do with the surplus,'' Clinton said. ``But we have to ask 
ourselves, what should our first priority be?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in an address filled with reminiscences of his  
come-from-behind 1992 campaign, Clinton urged an ebullient 
gathering at a party fund-raiser in Manchester to support Al Gore's 
presidential bid in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody had more to do with the decisions we've made and  
success we've enjoyed than Vice President Al Gore,'' he said. 
People in the audience waived Gore 2000 placards. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said it was a coincidence that Clinton  
chose New Hampshire for his first foray beyond Washington to 
promote his budget since the Senate acquitted him of perjury and 
obstruction of justice charges. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton reminded his Granite State followers that when he  
was buffeted by questions of infidelity and draft-dodging and his 
campaign appeared to be on the ropes in 1992, he went to Dover and 
pledged to fight until ``the last dog dies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He placed second in the state's Democratic primary, but beat  
expectations, and went on to win the party's nomination. Clinton 
said with a smile Wednesday that people in Dover had quipped that 
``this dog's limping, but still going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you had listened to the political experts, the dog would  
have died,'' he said. ``But instead you held out a lifeline. You 
decided that the election should go on.... You embraced our 
cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He left the stage with a confident jab at the air and lingered  
along the rope line, shaking hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget plan calls for reserving 62 percent of the  
surplus to shore up Social Security before the baby boomers retire, 
applying 15 percent to Medicare, and using another 12 percent to 
help fund individual accounts to supplement Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP has agreed in principle to setting aside 62 percent for  
Social Security, but there is sharp disagreement over how that 
should be done and over the rest of Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that whatever we do on all the other issues, there will  
be a common understanding that our first priority needs to be to 
keep the economy strong, deal with the aging of America, and invest 
in the future of this country,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the $1,000 tax credit for families dealing with the  
burdens of a loved one who needs long-term care, the president's 
health care proposals include $44 million in credits to help small 
businesses provide health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	He also voiced support for a bill before Congress that would  
make it easier for more people with disabilities to buy into 
Medicaid and Medicare and provide a $1,000 tax credit to offset the 
costs of services they require. 
</P>
<P>
	Again, Clinton called for a ``patients' bill of rights'' to  
ensure that group medical plans allow people to use the nearest 
hospital in an emergency and have access to specialists. A similar 
measure failed in Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all get sick, we all need doctors, we all need health  
care,'' Clinton said. ``This should not be a partisan issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone greeted the president warmly Thursday. A front-page  
editorial in The Union Leader newspaper declared ``Mr. President, 
you're a disgrace!'' A protester dressed in prison stripes and a 
Clinton mask waved at the motorcade in the town of Merrimack. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton appeared to be enjoying himself throughout the day,  
listening intently to panelists and making the motorcade return to 
the restaurant he lunched at in Merrimack so he could shake hands 
with three dozen students and adults who waited in the rain to see 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	He also harkened back to 1992 to underscore his record in  
office, drawing a chuckle from the audience when he talked about 
the debate over the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was an inconceivable discussion in 1991 and 1992 in New  
Hampshire,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Linked to Horse Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	El Nino, the excuse for everything from droughts to hurricanes,  
is now being blamed for outbreaks of a deadly horse disease. 
</P>
<P>
	English scientists have found evidence tying El Nino -- the  
abnormal warming of the Pacific Ocean that causes weather extremes 
-- to African Horse Sickness in South Africa. The findings were 
reported in today's issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	After reviewing horse breeding records dating to 1803,  
researchers found that 13 of the 14 major outbreaks in South Africa 
occurred during extreme conditions known as the warm-phase El 
Nino/Southern Oscillation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14th outbreak, in 1996, wasn't during an El Nino year but  
unfolded during similar weather -- a drought followed by heavy 
rains. 
</P>
<P>
	``It creates ripe conditions for the disease to spread. What's  
important here is that it almost always occurs only when El Nino is 
present,'' said Matthew Baylis, a researcher at the Institute for 
Animal Health in Surrey, England. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylis and colleagues believe the outbreaks begin because the  
drought dries up water sources, driving disease-carrying zebras 
into contact with horses in their search for water. Small, biting 
insects called midges then spread the disease from zebras to 
horses. 
</P>
<P>
	When heavy rains end the drought, the population of midges  
soars, accelerating the spread of the disease. The disorder kills 
95 percent of infected horses.

<HEADLINE> Galarraga Stricken With Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Andres Galarraga was enjoying the prime of his  
career in his late 30s, managing to turn back the clock with a 
vigorous training regimen. His bulging arms and washboard stomach 
were unmistakable signs of an athlete in peak physical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	But no exercise program could ward off the stunning diagnosis  
that came Thursday: The Big Cat has cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, cleanup hitter and first baseman for the Atlanta  
Braves, has a tumor in his lower back and will miss the entire 
season. Doctors are optimistic he will be able to return in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's isolated to a small bone in his lower back and we expect  
his treatment to be successful,'' said Dr. Lee Kelley, a team 
orthopedist for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Galarraga, who hit .305 with 44 home runs and  
121 RBIs last season, will not require surgery. He will undergo six 
months of treatment, including chemotherapy followed by radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga was diagnosed with the disease at Atlanta's Piedmont  
Hospital. He will be released within a day or two and return to his 
home in West Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, a native of Venezuela, was not at the news conference  
but released a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``To all my fans in Atlanta, Venezuela and around the country, I  
was looking forward toward the `99 season,'' he said. 
``Unfortunately, I'm hit with this setback. But, I promise you, I 
will be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The news of Galarraga's illness stunned those who have followed  
his career. After solid but unspectacular seasons in his 20s, he 
blossomed into a full-fledged superstar in his 30s, in part because 
of a strenuous workout program every offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, the strangest things happen,'' said Colorado  
general manager Bob Gebhard, who has known Galarraga since he was a 
16-year-old in the Montreal Expos organization. ``He's the last guy 
in the world you would expect to come up with that because he was a 
big, strong, healthy individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first season with the Rockies, Galarraga led the NL with  
a .370 average in 1993. Over the past five years, he has averaged 
39 homers and 121 RBIs, becoming the first player in baseball 
history to hit 40 homers in back-to-back seasons with different 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	After posting 47 and 41 homers during his final two seasons in  
Colorado, he signed a $24.75 million, three-year contract with the 
Braves. Galarraga proved that his power wasn't a product of the 
thin air at Coors Field, going over 40 again last season. 
</P>
<P>
	He also put together four straight 100-RBI seasons, beginning at  
age 34. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are saddened by this news, but optimistic about the  
prognosis,'' general manager John Schuerholz said from Atlanta's 
spring training complex in Kissimmee, Fla. ``Everyone knows what 
Andres means to the Braves on and off the field, but our main 
concern is his health and well-being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga was a leader of the large Latin contingent in the  
Braves' clubhouse, a gentle man who usually had a smile on his 
face. He managed to remain cordial even during a dismal NL 
championship series, when he hit just .095 with four errors as the 
Braves were beaten in six games by San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga is the fourth prominent baseball player since 1996 to  
be stricken with cancer, following Brett Butler, Eric Davis and 
Darryl Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad that he's out for the season, but it's a relief to  
know the cancer hasn't spread,'' manager Bobby Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga -- known as the Big Cat because of his grace and  
agility -- injured his back near the end of the last season. He was 
treated for what appeared to be a strain, but persistent pain 
remained. Kelley had Galarraga come to Atlanta earlier this month 
for an MRI and then a biopsy, which revealed the lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga's type of cancer can be isolated or widespread, Kelley  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, by all the studies we have, it is fairly  
isolated,'' he said. ``I think the potential for his recovery is 
very good with successful treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Galarraga's diagnosis, the Braves had few holes in their  
lineup as they opened spring training Thursday to begin the quest 
for an eighth straight postseason appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	The main questions centered around 21-year-old Bruce Chen,  
scheduled to be the fifth starter, and the comeback attempt by 
former closer Mark Wohlers, who wound up in the minor leagues last 
year when he couldn't find the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
	After finishing with the best record in the NL (106-56) and  
hitting a franchise-record 215 homers, the Braves improved their 
offense by signing outfielders Brian Jordan and Otis Nixon and 
trading for second baseman Bret Boone. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Klesko, who started in left last year, will now shift to  
first base, a position he played in the minors. Nixon and Gerald 
Williams will platoon in Klesko's former position. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our offense will be potent, but obviously not as potent  
without Andres,'' Cox said. ``Otis will be playing a lot of left 
field and we feel good to have Klesko.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klesko, who struggled last season and hit only 18 homers, had  
been considered expendable with the acquisition of Nixon and 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel very secure with Ryan at first base,'' Schuerholz  
said. ``We may have to address our depth in the future, but we feel 
fine for now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga also has played with St. Louis during his 13-year  
career. Overall, he has a .290 average with 332 homers and 1,172 
RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Money Funds Rose in Latest Week / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds increased by $4.52 billion to $862.16 billion in the 
latest week, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose  
by $4.42 billion to $709.56 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets increased by $94.6 million to $152.60 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds increase by $7.40  
billion to $601.38 billion for the same period. Among institutional 
funds, taxable money market fund assets increased by $7.82 billion 
to $551.09 billion; assets of tax-exempt funds decreased by $414.9 
million to $50.30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.464 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.452 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell to  
4.36 percent in the week ended Tuesday from 4.37 percent in the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield fell to 4.39 percent from 4.42 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield fell to 4.45 percent from 4.47  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield fell to 
4.48 percent from 4.52 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
57 days, unchanged from the previous week, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts was 2.20 percent as of 
Wednesday, down from 2.21 percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the annual  
percentage yield available on interest-bearing checking accounts 
fell to 0.97 percent from 0.98 percent a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Rate Monitor said the annual percentage yield was unchanged  
at 4.13 percent on six-month certificates of deposit. However, 
yields on 1-year CDs rose to 4.30 percent from 4.29 as they rose on 
2 1/2-year CDs to 4.36 percent from 4.35 percent. Yields on 5-year CDs 
were unchanged at 4.49 percent.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T-TCI Merger Wins FCC Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T's planned merger with cable giant TCI,  
which could dramatically change how people get local phone and 
Internet services, has won federal regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission, concluding Wednesday that  
the merger was likely to benefit consumers, didn't impose any major 
conditions on the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Local phone competition has focused mostly on high-volume  
business customers, but the merger holds the promise of providing 
residential customers a new choice for local service. It also 
offers consumers one-stop shopping for local calling, Internet 
access and long-distance service -- all over their cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am optimistic because the combined resources of AT&AMP;T and TCI  
surely will generate a very substantial effort to expand the 
choices now available to residential phone subscribers,'' said FCC 
Chairman Bill Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC did not force AT&AMP;T and Tele-Communications Inc. to  
provide other companies with access to TCI's high-speed cable TV 
lines. Consumer groups, America Online and others had pressed the 
agency to require AT&AMP;T to give other companies access to those 
lines to offer competing Internet or phone services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the early stage of deployment of cable's high-speed  
Internet access services, it would be imprudent to act now,'' 
Kennard said. The commission concluded that the merger would not 
harm competition for Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, meanwhile, will continue to lobby regulators and lawmakers  
on Capitol Hill to provide rival companies with access to TCI's 
high-speed lines as well as those controlled by other cable 
companies, said AOL spokeswoman Kathy McKiernan. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the merger, AT&AMP;T will control TCI's stake in AtHome  
Corp., a leading provider of high-speed Internet access. Consumer 
groups have said AT&AMP;T could charge extra if customers got Internet 
service over the merged companies' lines and wanted another 
Internet service provider, such as AOL. But the commission did not 
set any conditions on that part of the deal, either. 
</P>
<P>
	A pleased AT&AMP;T expects to close the merger, valued at nearly $32  
billion when it was announced last year, by March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers Union's  
Washington office, insisted that ``most consumers won't see 
benefits because the merged company is likely to serve only 
high-end customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said, however, he has a commitment from AT&AMP;T to ``offer  
service uniformly in all neighborhoods in every city it serves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kimmelman also is worried that the merged company might raise  
cable TV rates to help finance local phone and other new ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is the nation's largest telecommunications company. TCI is  
the nation's second-largest cable TV company, with lines that reach 
one-third of U.S. homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of TCI's lines have been upgraded to permit cable TV  
customers to connect their computers to the Internet at speeds much 
faster than regular telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, AT&AMP;T intends to make TCI's lines capable of  
providing customers with local phone service, too. AT&AMP;T has a 
separate agreement with cable company Time Warner to provide local 
phone service over its high-speed cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable agreements would give AT&AMP;T a way to get into homes  
without having to rely on phone lines controlled by the regional 
Bell companies, which dominate the local phone market.

<HEADLINE> N.F.L. Free Agent Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Antonio Freeman, one of the NFL's premier receivers, expressed  
his disappointment in his current team's offer Thursday. His 
complaints came on the same afternoon when Eddie Kennison, one of 
the league's more disappointing pass-catchers, was traded by St. 
Louis to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman, Green Bay's franchise player, said the Packers' initial  
offer last week was for $4.4 million a year. That number didn't 
come out of his mouth easily. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not even in the ballpark,'' Freeman said. ``And they  
know that. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market value right now is $6 million. They could have had  
me for half that, for $3 million, had they signed me last summer. 
But they waited and now I'm benefiting. It's not my fault that 
salaries have skyrocketed. They're the ones who waited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his All-Pro season, Freeman made 84 receptions for a  
league-high 1,424 yards and 14 touchdowns last season, when he 
played several games with a broken jaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman said he would hold out all summer -- as running back  
Dorsey Leven did last year -- if the Packers don't meet his salary 
demands. He also didn't understand why the Packers offered him 
below the market rate two days before signing defensive lineman 
Santana Dotson to a deal averaging more than $5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He deserves it, I'm not saying he doesn't,'' Freeman said.  
``But here they are offering less to a premier player. It doesn't 
make sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennison isn't likely to see anywhere near the kind of money  
Freeman seeks. The 18th pick in the 1996 draft, Kennison prospered 
as a rookie with 54 receptions for 924 yards and nine touchdowns, 
while returning two punts for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's slumped since, with a total of 42 catches over the last  
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Rams settled for a second-round pick from the Saints for  
Kennison, a native of Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal as coaches is to get Eddie back to the form he  
displayed as a rookie,'' said Saints coach Mike Ditka, whose team 
has three of the first 42 selections in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams also released defensive tackle Joe Phillips, a 13-year  
veteran who was critical of coach Dick Vermeil's unrelenting 
practice regimen last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota re-signed free agent linebacker Ed McDaniel to a  
five-year deal. McDaniel made his seventh season with the team his 
best, leading the Vikings in tackles and making the Pro Bowl for 
the first time in his career. He has led Minnesota in tackles three 
of the last four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington shored up its secondary by signing safety Sam Shade  
to a four-year, $10.4 million contract with a $2.5 million signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Shade played the last four seasons with Cincinnati.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's an outstanding tackler and special teams player and is a  
combination of everything you look for in a safety,'' said Redskins 
coach Norv Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	New England, which lost punter Tom Tupa to the New York Jets  
through free agency, signed veteran Lee Johnson to a three-year, $2 
million dollar contract. Johnson, 37, was fifth in the AFC last 
season with an average 44.7 yards per punt with the Cincinnati 
Bengals. He was cut after criticizing Bengals management in early 
December.

<HEADLINE>  Grizzlies Need Some Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Grizzlies are taking the  
long way around this shortened NBA season. 
</P>
<P>
	After beating the Los Angeles Clippers in two overtimes Tuesday  
night, Vancouver flew home to play the Boston Celtics on Wednesday 
and went three overtimes before losing 131-129. 
</P>
<P>
	Ah, youth!  
</P>
<P>
	``This is what I want to do. I'd rather be playing than  
sitting,'' said Mike Bibby, the Grizzlies' rookie point guard who 
logged 54 minutes against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other time a team played five overtimes in two  
consecutive games was 47 years ago, before there was a 24-second 
shot clock. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1951 the New York Knicks and Rochester Royals played  
a single-overtime game, then played four overtimes two days later. 
For the record, the teams split. 
</P>
<P>
	But those games were two days apart. The young Grizzlies did it  
back-to-back early in a season in which teams have been thrown 
together and had trained for just two weeks following the end of 
the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The players said they were more disappointed than tired after  
playing what amounted to more than 2 1/2 games -- 121 minutes in 
playing time -- in 28 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	They blew their chance of winning three straight games for just  
the second time in team history and could have improved to 4-3, 
which would have marked the first time they were over .500 this 
late in the season since 1995-96, their first year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely a tough one for us, especially coming off  
last night,'' center Bryant Reeves said after the Celtics game. 
``We both played in California last night so they were in the same 
situation. We had chances to win and we just didn't capitalize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston coach Rick Pitino, whose team had lost the night before  
in Sacramento, said the game was ``really like a Rocky fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the highlights of Wednesday's game:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Grizzlies, who led 74-64 after three quarters, never  
trailed until 4:10 into the fourth quarter. After that, there were 
17 lead changes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Boston's Dana Barros forced the first overtime when he hit a  
3-pointer with 0.5 seconds left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Celtics led by eight points in the first OT, only to allow  
a 10-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Celtics blew a four-point lead in the final minute of the  
second OT. 
</P>
<P>
	-- And finally, the Grizzlies squandered a four-point lead in the  
final 50 seconds of the third overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics' Paul Pierce cut the lead to 129-127 with a short  
jumper, then Andrew DeClercq put Boston up for good with a 
three-point play with 15.8 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies never got another shot off thanks to Pierce's two  
steals on Vancouver's final two possessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was saying to myself, `I hope we don't go into another  
overtime.' It sort of wears on your legs. I was glad it was over, 
'' said Pierce, who scored seven of his 26 points in the third OT 
and finished with seven steals. ``It was grueling but it was a lot 
of fun to be out there, competing against some of the top players 
in the world. I feel like I'm in Fantasyland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver set a team record for most points in a game, although  
their previous best of 121 points was set in four quarters. The 
Grizzlies also set team records for most free-throws made (45), 
most attempted (50) and the longest game (3:49). 
</P>
<P>
	Shareef Abdur-Rahim, who played 56 minutes, scored a career-high  
39 points, while Bibby scored 23. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no rest for the weary, either.  
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies, off to Minnesota for a game Friday, won't have  
more than one day rest between games until they get a two-day break 
in late April. The Celtics are in the middle of a six-game road 
trip that takes them to Portland on Friday.

<HEADLINE>  Grizzlies Need Some Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Grizzlies are taking the  
long way around this shortened NBA season. 
</P>
<P>
	After beating the Los Angeles Clippers in two overtimes Tuesday  
night, Vancouver flew home to play the Boston Celtics on Wednesday 
and went three overtimes before losing 131-129. 
</P>
<P>
	Ah, youth!  
</P>
<P>
	``This is what I want to do. I'd rather be playing than  
sitting,'' said Mike Bibby, the Grizzlies' rookie point guard who 
logged 54 minutes against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other time a team played five overtimes in two  
consecutive games was 47 years ago, before there was a 24-second 
shot clock. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1951 the New York Knicks and Rochester Royals played  
a single-overtime game, then played four overtimes two days later. 
For the record, the teams split. 
</P>
<P>
	But those games were two days apart. The young Grizzlies did it  
back-to-back early in a season in which teams have been thrown 
together and had trained for just two weeks following the end of 
the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The players said they were more disappointed than tired after  
playing what amounted to more than 2 1/2 games -- 121 minutes in 
playing time -- in 28 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	They blew their chance of winning three straight games for just  
the second time in team history and could have improved to 4-3, 
which would have marked the first time they were over .500 this 
late in the season since 1995-96, their first year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely a tough one for us, especially coming off  
last night,'' center Bryant Reeves said after the Celtics game. 
``We both played in California last night so they were in the same 
situation. We had chances to win and we just didn't capitalize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston coach Rick Pitino, whose team had lost the night before  
in Sacramento, said the game was ``really like a Rocky fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the highlights of Wednesday's game:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Grizzlies, who led 74-64 after three quarters, never  
trailed until 4:10 into the fourth quarter. After that, there were 
17 lead changes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Boston's Dana Barros forced the first overtime when he hit a  
3-pointer with 0.5 seconds left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Celtics led by eight points in the first OT, only to allow  
a 10-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Celtics blew a four-point lead in the final minute of the  
second OT. 
</P>
<P>
	-- And finally, the Grizzlies squandered a four-point lead in the  
final 50 seconds of the third overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics' Paul Pierce cut the lead to 129-127 with a short  
jumper, then Andrew DeClercq put Boston up for good with a 
three-point play with 15.8 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies never got another shot off thanks to Pierce's two  
steals on Vancouver's final two possessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was saying to myself, `I hope we don't go into another  
overtime.' It sort of wears on your legs. I was glad it was over, 
'' said Pierce, who scored seven of his 26 points in the third OT 
and finished with seven steals. ``It was grueling but it was a lot 
of fun to be out there, competing against some of the top players 
in the world. I feel like I'm in Fantasyland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver set a team record for most points in a game, although  
their previous best of 121 points was set in four quarters. The 
Grizzlies also set team records for most free-throws made (45), 
most attempted (50) and the longest game (3:49). 
</P>
<P>
	Shareef Abdur-Rahim, who played 56 minutes, scored a career-high  
39 points, while Bibby scored 23. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no rest for the weary, either.  
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies, off to Minnesota for a game Friday, won't have  
more than one day rest between games until they get a two-day break 
in late April. The Celtics are in the middle of a six-game road 
trip that takes them to Portland on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Marino To Lobby Against Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino  
and Florida Panthers right wing Scott Mellanby will team up as 
registered legislative lobbyists against the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino and Mellanby will tell lawmakers why insurers should be  
required to pay benefits for autistic children, lobbyist Ron Book 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people know Dan has an autistic child, but not many know  
that Scott does as well,'' said Book, who works for Dolphins and

<HEADLINE> Kratt Brothers Give Us 'Zoboomafoo' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What sort of animal behavior is this, where  
every male of the species must be wearing a jacket before he is 
allowed to feed! 
</P>
<P>
	But Chris and Martin Kratt, husky brothers clad in outdoorsy  
wear, aren't troubled. Creators and stars of the wildly popular PBS 
kids' show ``Kratts' Creatures,'' they are used to beasts of all 
kinds, even a snooty maitre d' in a Manhattan bistro. 
</P>
<P>
	Having entered this lair, each brother accepts a shapeless blue  
blazer. Then, accorded lunch, they eagerly discuss their new 
series, ``Zoboomafoo.'' (Check local listings.) 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike ``Kratts','' now in its third season delighting  
grade-schoolers on up, ``Zoboomafoo'' (zah-BOO-mah-foo) is a 
wildlife series expressly for preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of kids' show characters are based on animals,'' Martin  
says, ``but nobody had been introducing kids age 3 or 4 to the 
world of animals. How do kids first learn about wolves? They read 
`Little Red Riding Hood,' where the wolf is a bad, evil 
character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris jumps in. ``Kids learn fear and negative stereotypes,'' he  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	To which Martin adds, ``We just wanted to put out the truth.''  
</P>
<P>
	With that, Martin orders roast chicken. Nothing personal, he  
insists: ``Predation is part of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, his embrace of the animal world seems absolute. Asked to  
name a critter he doesn't like, he can think of only one, a pesky 
bacteria that gave him a malaria-like condition in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
	With similar beneficence, Chris concedes only ``mixed feelings''  
about a leech that penetrated his boots, then his feet, when he was 
in Sumatra filming orangutans. ``It was interesting to watch how 
the leeches did it. That's the part that I liked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kratts bring a whole new meaning to the term creature  
comforts -- an unconditional respect and amused indulgence for 
animals echoing throughout ``Zoboomafoo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, though they are ages 29 and 33 respectively, Chris  
and Martin are squarely on a kid's wavelength with their wide-open 
gusto. This proves infectious for anyone older who might sneak a 
peak. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zoboomafoo'' headquarters is Animal Junction, where the Kratts  
welcome animal friends that happen by, and where they set out for 
adventures they have chronicled all over the world with their 
wildlife photography. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually an enormous, in-the-round set erected in a Toronto TV  
studio, Animal Junction seems nestled beneath a forest canopy in 
the middle of a sun-dappled tropical anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a magical kind of watering hole,'' says Martin.  
``Preschoolers get to look at the animals in this very safe place, 
where all the rules of nature are suspended: There's no predation 
in Animal Junction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's also the home of the show's namesake, a Sifaka lemur native  
only to Madagascar, as animated and playful as its human 
companions. Zoboomafoo (Zoboo for short) is portrayed by a 
real-life lemur deftly intercut with a look-alike puppet that can 
speak and otherwise follow a script. 
</P>
<P>
	``We chose the Sifaka lemur because he looks like a puppet in  
the first place,'' Martin explains. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like to talk about animals the viewer has never really  
heard of,'' says Chris. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, ``Zoboomafoo'' plays no favorites: Dogs and cats are as  
likely to visit as more exotic fauna. 
</P>
<P>
	On a typical half-hour, we hear a swish of wings and Chris calls  
out, ``Everybody duck!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a vulture, not a duck!'' chortles Martin as the creature  
lands atop his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``A turkey vulture has a better sense of smell than any other  
animal in the world,'' Chris reveals. 
</P>
<P>
	But baby elephant Toothbrush can do more with her trunk than  
smell: She plays the harmonica. Then, when the brothers aren't 
watching, she wanders away. 
</P>
<P>
	No problem. Bloodhound Myrtle picks up the elephant's scent from  
the harmonica, and leads Chris and Martin on a chase to find 
Toothbrush out in the wilds. 
</P>
<P>
	It was in the wilds of New Jersey that the brothers grew up,  
loving animals and keeping lots of pets. In college, Martin 
graduated with a zoology degree. Chris chose biology. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the real education started. They roamed the world with  
video gear, teaching themselves to film and play on-camera hosts to 
the creatures they encountered. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the beginning,'' Martin says, ``we had a very clear  
mission: to introduce kids to the world of animals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surely no one has ever made this TV mission more interesting and  
fun. And there's no jacket required.

<HEADLINE> Few Residency Rules in Senate Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If Hillary Rodham Clinton were to run for  
Senate in New York, she doubtless would be tagged a carpetbagger 
shopping for a seat outside her known political territory. 
</P>
<P>
	But she would be on solid constitutional ground, election law  
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She could go anywhere she wants to,'' said Doug Lewis,  
executive director of The Election Center, a nonprofit information 
clearinghouse in Houston. ``Obviously, there has to be an opening, 
or a place where she'd be a viable candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She would not even need to move to New York until Election Day  
2000. The U.S. Constitution only requires senators be residents 
``when elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution lists three requirements for senator: a minimum  
age of 30, U.S. citizenship for at least nine years, and that the 
senator, ``when elected, be an inhabitant of that state for which 
he shall be chosen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several states have imposed additional restrictions, but  
election law experts say they are constitutionally suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts, Wyoming and Nebraska, among other states, require  
that a Senate candidate be a registered voter. In Ohio, a Senate 
candidate has to be registered to vote 30 days before the election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think restrictions beyond what's in the Constitution  
would stand up'' if challenged in court, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Jaeger, secretary of state in North Dakota, agreed, citing a  
Supreme Court ruling overturning congressional term limits as a 
guide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are of the opinion that a state can't really go beyond what  
the Constitution says,'' Jaeger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Practically speaking, no candidate would be likely to make a  
Senate run in New York or elsewhere without establishing residency 
at least some months before an election, as Robert F. Kennedy did 
in New York in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, from Massachusetts, campaigned in New York for months  
that year but did not actually live there until he rented an 
apartment in New York City in August. 
</P>
<P>
	He won his Senate seat three months later, establishing the  
precedent that the state is open to outsiders with political star 
power. Republican James Buckley, of Connecticut, did the same thing 
in New York in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, as the wife of a sitting president, would offer  
New Yorkers a candidate with instant name recognition and proven 
fund-raising abilities, Democratic supporters argue. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll of 502 New York voters by the Marist Institute for Public  
Opinion showed 56 percent thought Mrs. Clinton should run. About 40 
percent said they were not at all concerned that she does not come 
from New York, while about 25 percent said that fact concerned them 
a great deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, taken Feb. 16 and released Thursday, has a margin of  
error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The original carpetbaggers were would-be officeholders from the  
North who packed their bags and headed for sunnier political climes 
in the South after the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	Such true outsiders are unusual in modern politics. More typical  
may be Jack McMullen's semioutsider candidacy last year in Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	McMullen, a wealthy Massachusetts Republican, used his Vermont  
vacation home as a home base to seek the GOP Senate nomination 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he lost to a homegrown folk hero, McMullen, like Mrs.  
Clinton, had the Constitution on his side. 
</P>
<P>
	``Home can be where the heart is, in New York or elsewhere,''  
joked Jan Baran, a Washington lawyer specializing in election law. 
``The truth is, it's not that difficult to run for public office in 
the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Ocalan To Be Tried at Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan will  
be tried at the island prison in the Sea of Marmara where he is 
being held, Turkey's Justice Ministry announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision reflected Turkey's desire to maintain strict  
security throughout the trial, after days of attacks at embassies 
and consulates throughout Europe and elsewhere by Kurds protesting 
Ocalan's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Kurds were killed by Israeli security guards while  
attempting to storm the Israeli consulate in Berlin on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ocalan, has filed a  
complaint at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, 
France, protesting his arrest by Turks in the Kenyan capital, 
Nairobi, a court statement said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint charges the arrest and detention violated four  
articles of the European Convention on Human Rights that guarantee 
a right to personal liberty and security, the right to life, a ban 
on torture of prisoners and the right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether the court would hear the complaint.  
</P>
<P>
	Many of the demonstrations across Europe ended Wednesday. But  
about 40 protesters held a clerk hostage in the Greek Embassy in 
London and announced they were beginning a hunger strike, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters promised today that they would leave the embassy  
provided they are not arrested and are allowed to make a statement 
to the media. Occupations also continued at the offices of 
political parties in Sweden and Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany, Kurds attacked Turkish restaurants, stores and  
travel agencies early today, injuring six people, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Istanbul, Ocalan supporters protested overnight. Four buses  
and two cars were set on fire, and the windows of several other 
vehicles were smashed. Police detained an unspecified number of 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 700 Kurdish activists -- most members of a pro-Kurdish  
political party -- have been rounded up in Istanbul and several 
southeastern Turkish cities since Ocalan's arrest, according to the 
independent Human Rights Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, stormed  
Greek diplomatic missions on Tuesday after hearing word of Ocalan's 
capture a day earlier by Turks in Kenya, where he had been hiding 
in the Greek ambassador's residence in Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurdish protesters also targeted Israel after reports suggested  
that the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, had a hand in the 
operation. Israel denied the report and temporarily closed down its 
diplomatic missions in Europe as a security measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department on Wednesday warned that American interests  
could be targeted by Kurdish violence, and urged U.S. citizens 
traveling or living abroad to review their personal security. 
</P>
<P>
	The PKK's strength in Europe comes from tens of thousands of  
Kurds who have fled Turkey, most seeking political asylum in 
European countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey blames the 49-year-old Ocalan for 37,000 deaths that  
occurred during the fight between his rebels and Turkish military 
since the uprising began in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey has often been accused of human rights abuses during its  
war against the PKK and many European countries have expressed 
concern over Ocalan's trial, despite Turkey's assurances he will be 
treated fairly. Turkey has barred three of Ocalan's foreign lawyers 
from entering the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In an apparent effort to show that Ocalan would not be  
mistreated, the government released a video tape of the rebel 
leader during his flight to Turkey. On the dramatic footage, a 
Turkish officer asks a handcuffed and blindfolded Ocalan to relax 
and says, ``you are our guest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the government released more footage showing Ocalan  
standing in front of two Turkish flags after being taken to the 
prison-island of Imrali in the Sea of Marmara. 
</P>
<P>
	``My eyes are bothered,'' Ocalan answers a commander at one  
point while wincing under camera lights. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's capture has brought the conflict back into the  
limelight. The 12 million Kurds in Turkey are denied the right to 
use the Kurdish language in education and broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports said authorities have already begun interrogating him at  
the island prison. Inmates on Imrali Island, about 35 miles south 
of Istanbul, were transferred to other prisons and the guards were 
replaced by special commando teams as an extra security measure. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear when a trial there would begin, but Prime  
Minister Bulent Ecevit has said it would be soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan was already being tried in absentia on charges of  
terrorism and evading compulsory military service. He could face 
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The capture of Ocalan has not stopped Turkish troops from  
tracking down the rebels. They launched an incursion into northern 
Iraq on Monday to hit rebel bases there. Ecevit called the 
operations routine.

<HEADLINE> Crewman Testifies in Cable Car Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A crewman on the Marine jet that  
sliced an Italian ski gondola cable, killing 20 people, testified 
Thursday that he never heard an alarm that should have indicated 
the plane was flying too low. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Chandler Seagraves said that early in the flight, pilot  
Capt. Richard Ashby had trouble with the radar altimeter, which 
measures the plane's altitude. But Ashby put the plane into a 
climb, and the altimeter began working again, Seagraves said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves also said the altimeter was set to sound an alarm if  
the jet dipped below 800 feet. After Ashby crossed a ridge in the 
Alps and then flew lower, Seagraves testified, he never heard the 
alarm go off. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, is on trial for 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter  
and other charges. He could get 200 years in prison if convicted. 
Prosecutors claim he flew the four-man radar-jamming jet too low 
and too fast when it hit the gondola cable about 360 feet off the 
ground on Feb. 3, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's attorneys say the Mount Cermis ski lift wasn't on his  
government-issued map, the altimeter on his EA-6B Prowler 
malfunctioned, and he experienced an optical illusion that made him 
think he was flying higher than he really was. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves said he belonged to a different squadron than Ashby  
and was assigned to fly with him only the previous night. The day 
of the flight, the crew was briefed on the mission route, 
obstructions and altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our restriction was 1,000 feet,'' he said. An Air Force  
colonel testified Wednesday that the restriction was actually 2,000 
feet because of the potential for avalanches. 
</P>
<P>
	In his own squadron, Seagraves said, pilots set their altimeters  
to sound alarms at 900 feet when they flew under a 1,000-foot 
restriction, but he said he decided Ashby's setting it at 800 feet 
was prudent. If it were set at higher altitude, the alarm would go 
off too often, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That way guys don't become tone deaf,'' Seagraves said.  
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves said he felt the plane shiver when it struck the  
cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt Capt. Ashby maneuver the aircraft downward as if he was  
trying to miss something. I felt the impact,'' he said, snapping 
his fingers. ``There was a thud, a vibration in the airplane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after the jet hit the cable, the navigator, Capt.  
Joseph Schweitzer, shouted ``Climb! Climb! Climb!'' Seagraves said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he could see the damage to the jet -- the end of one wing  
was flipped up at a 45-degree angle, and there was damage to the 
vertical stabilizer, a football-shaped device at the rear of the 
plane that contained its electronic gear. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby still managed to fly the plane back to the Aviano air  
base. 
</P>
<P>
	When the trial opened, prosecutors said they would show Ashby  
performed a 360-degree roll during the flight against regulations. 
Seagraves, however, said Ashby performed a standard maneuver to 
evade enemy radar. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves, 29, and the other backseat crewman -- Capt. William  
Raney II, 26 -- initially faced charges in connection with the 
crash, but they were dropped. Schweitzer, 31, is scheduled for 
trial on the same charges as Ashby in March.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Explores Impact of IOC Rift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney Olympics chief executive Sandy  
Hollway says the IOC should bear a share of cutbacks if the 2000 
Games fall short of their marketing target. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway ruled out a renegotiation of the Sydney Organizing  
Committee's controversial deal with the Australian Olympic 
Committee, which has guaranteed the AOC $65 million, regardless of 
the financial outcome of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC marketing director Michael Payne has criticized the deal and  
called for it to be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hollway, faced with a $130 million shortfall in the  
sponsorship budget, said he would look for discussions with the IOC 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the IOC, I think we can enter a discussion with them about  
some of the levels of service and entitlements in that whole host 
city contract,'' Hollway said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were always to be the athletes' games and we must make  
them the athletes' games. I think it's even more important in light 
of the controversy in the international Olympic movement that we 
reaffirm this is about sport and athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway said he would be reluctant to order cuts to the quality  
of venues or areas such as the Olympic village. He said the needs 
of broadcasters and media must be met because ``that's the way the 
games get out to the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG has already suggested some areas of change for IOC  
services, only to be rebuffed. When SOCOG president Michael Knight 
said IOC members might like to forego their chauffeur-driven 
limousines and get on buses, Payne responded by saying the IOC 
would ship their own Mercedes Benz cars to Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you'll hear that from Mr. Payne again,'' Knight  
said today. ``When you say get out of the cars and get on the bus, 
for an IOC apparatchik to come back with a suggestion that wouldn't 
they be better off in a Mercedes misses the point. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Samaranch is very much prepared to catch the ferry or the  
bus. When he was here last year and I raised with him the 
possibility of IOC members catching the bus, he indicated he would 
be urging them very strongly to do so. He thought it was a sensible 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway said the IOC's bribes scandals were making it harder to  
raise sponsorship money, but he still thinks it's possible to reach 
the marketing goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutbacks should be ``put to one side entirely while we get on  
with ... boosting revenue raising and having a look in April.'' He 
said the IOC's report, expected in March, on corruption within its 
ranks would have a bearing on the sponsorship drive. 
</P>
<P>
	He said three new sponsors were expected to be ratified by the  
SOCOG board later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway said the AOC, which stitched up the profit-share deal in  
exchange for its veto powers over SOCOG decisions, is entitled to 
its money. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the AOC's concerned, they've got a contract and I  
don't see why they would or should shift away from that,'' Hollway 
said. ``In a sense, I would like to see Australian athletes have 
that legacy out of our Olympics in perpetuity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight and AOC president John Coates have also rejected a change  
in the deal.

<HEADLINE> Profile of Candidate Bob Smith </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. Bob Smith is a former teacher who says  
the public has a lot to learn and a former high school baseball 
coach who has spent his political career way out in right field. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the former real estate agent is bidding on some prime  
property: the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Decelle, a retired teacher who supervised Smith's first few  
years working in the classroom, remembers the passion for 
government the young civics teacher tried to impart to his 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Decelle, a lifelong Democrat, also remembers the heated  
political discussions the Republican Smith sparked with other 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to use the word opinionated, but that's what he  
is. What you see is what you get,'' Decelle said. ``He says one 
thing and does what he says.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 57, is unafraid to take a stand, even if everyone else  
remains seated. He was one of only five senators who voted against 
the 1991 Civil Rights Act, one of three senators who voted against 
the National Energy Policy Act in 1992 and one of three to vote 
against the nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg for Supreme Court 
justice. He voted against funding for Head Start, food stamps and 
emergency aid for hurricane victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was right, and the other 93 senators were wrong,'' he said  
about the Civil Rights vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters laughed in a 1997 hearing when Smith called President  
Clinton fund-raising mess ``probably the biggest scandal in the 
history of the republic.'' He also faced ridicule several years ago 
after giving a passionate speech against allowing elephants on 
Capitol grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith insists his extreme views will draw people together  
instead of alienating them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people deserve honesty and I think there are a broad  
range of voters out there who agree with me,'' he said in a 
telephone interview Wednesday. ``Clearly, there are enough people 
out there who agree with me for me to win the presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just issues. It's integrity, it's a passion of  
wanting to lead,'' he said. ``It's a simple kind of feeling, a 
feeling of patriotism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has visited 20 states in the year and a half since he  
began considering a run, with frequent stops in Iowa, home of the 
first presidential caucuses. Wherever he goes, he says he tells 
people about the life experiences that shaped his views: growing up 
without his father, who was killed in a World War II airplane 
crash, serving in the Navy in Vietnam, serving his community as a 
teacher and school board member. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've tried to introduce myself as a real person: Bob Smith the  
school teacher, the coach, the dad, the husband, then the 
senator,'' he said. ``I think people need to know who you are. If 
you're a good person in your life, you have a better chance of 
being a good president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith won his first House seat in 1984 after two unsuccessful  
campaigns and was re-elected twice. He was elected to the Senate in 
1990 and re-elected by a narrow margin in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Lois Beaulieu, a 70-year-old Newmarket businesswoman who has  
supported Smith from the start, says the early losses reveal as 
much about Smith as the wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a good loser,'' she said. ``If you can't be a good  
loser, you can't be a good winner. He never saw it as losing. It 
was just on to the next election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beaulieu said Smith won her over with his honesty: ``He doesn't  
talk double-talk. He speaks plain language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he comes from this first presidential primary state,  
the favorite-son factor is not looming large. In a recent poll of 
New Hampshire Republicans, only 4 percent said they would vote for 
Smith in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Woodburn, chairman of the state Democratic Party, last week  
offered $100 to the first Republican officeholder or GOP leader to 
endorse Smith publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're poking fun at Bob Smith to illustrate a serious lack of  
support he has,'' Woodburn said. ``We're trying to find where that 
lonely Republican is who will publicly support Bob Smith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. Tom Rice of Laconia took him up on the offer  
Wednesday, saying Smith would bring integrity to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased to announce my support for my good friend Bob  
Smith and look forward to receiving my $100 check from Jeff 
Woodburn -- payable to `Bob Smith for President,''' Rice said.

<HEADLINE> Nevada's Sen. Bryan Won't Run Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Democratic Sen. Richard Bryan said Thursday he  
won't run for a third term, dealing the second blow in two days to 
his party's hopes of retaking control of the Senate from the 
Republicans in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan, 61, said it was ``time to come home'' and ``experience  
different challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey said he did  
not want to spend the next two years raising money for a 
re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Their decisions, coupled with New York Sen. Daniel Patrick  
Moynihan's announcement in November that he won't run in 2000, give 
Republicans competitive opportunities in three states where 
Democratic incumbents would have been favored to win re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate, and must defend  
19 seats next year, compared with 14 for the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan said he and his wife, Bonnie, had agonized the last three  
months, then made a decision over the weekend. He said the 
acrimonious impeachment process had not played a role. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it was just a matter of timing,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A key factor in the decision, Bryan said, was that their three  
children will become parents this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle recalled when Bryan  
threatened to shut down the Senate if necessary to prevent the 
government from storing nuclear waste in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a fierce protector of Nevada's interests as well as an  
outstanding national leader,'' Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Party officials already were reaching out to potential  
successors. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats were in touch with former Gov. Bob Miller, while  
Republicans contacted former Rep. John Ensign, who was defeated in 
an extremely close Senate race last November against an incumbent, 
Sen. Harry Reid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am taking a very serious look at it,'' Ensign said. ``I will  
talk with my family and my friends, and do some praying about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan was appointed as Nevada's first public defender in 1966  
and elected to the state Assembly two years later. He was elected 
to the state Senate in 1972, state attorney general in 1978 and 
governor in 1982. He won the first of two Senate terms in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for the state of Nevada this is a loss beyond my  
ability to describe,'' said Reid, who later wiped away tears at 
Bryan's news conference. ``This is like a funeral to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan admitted his departure from public life wouldn't be easy.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is a fullness of time when men should go, and not occupy  
too long the high ground to which others have the right to 
advance,'' he said, quoting Thomas Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, that time has come.''

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Survivor Sues Bayer AG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- German pharmaceutical giant Bayer AG  
participated in World War II atrocities committed by Nazi doctors 
who experimented on Jews, according to a federal lawsuit filed by a 
Holocaust survivor. 
</P>
<P>
	Eva Mozes Kor of Terre Haute, Ind., filed the lawsuit Wednesday  
in U.S. District Court here. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayer paid Nazi officials for access to those confined in  
concentration camps and collaborated in Nazi experiments as a form 
of research and development, plaintiff's lawyer Irwin B. Levin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's impossible to put on a scale the various horrors of the  
Holocaust, but this case represents the worst example of individual 
and corporate evil that the legal system may ever see,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kor claims that Bayer monitored and supervised medical  
experiments at Auschwitz, the Nazi concentration camp in Poland 
where she was held. Her lawsuit states that prisoners were injected 
with germs known to cause diseases ``to test the effectiveness of 
various drugs'' manufactured by Bayer. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and the recovery of  
profits it maintains Bayer earned as a result of such research. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, Bayer has denied any involvement in the  
experiments, refused to offer any compensation and refused to 
disclose information, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, Bayer had admitted to using slave labor drafted from  
concentration camps. On Tuesday, Bayer AG was among a dozen German 
companies that said they would participate in a $1.7 billion fund 
to compensate individuals who had been used for slave labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Margo Barnes, a spokeswoman for Bayer's U.S. operations, said  
Wednesday that the company had not been notified of the lawsuit and 
had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kor and her twin sister, Miriam, survived their 10-month  
ordeal at Auschwitz and were liberated by Soviet troops in January 
1945. They were nearly 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Miriam died in 1993 of kidney disease. Her kidneys had never  
grown to adult size due to her treatment at Auschwitz, according to 
the lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Union Leader Retires Amid Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The chief of the city's largest municipal  
workers union, who had been on unpaid leave during an investigation 
of possible corruption, has retired. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Hill's decision to resign as the executive director of  
District Council 37 was effective immediately, the council's 
administrator, Lee Saunders, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``After much deliberation, he has decided that this would be in  
the best interest of his family and the council,'' said Saunders. 
``We wish him well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, 62, has headed the council for 11 years. The union  
represents 120,000 city workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of Hill's retirement follows a series of  
problems for the council, which is under investigation by the 
Manhattan District Attorney's office following allegations of vote 
tampering. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill did not immediately return a call for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, District Council 37 negotiated a contract for a  
coalition of about 160,000 workers including clerks, elevator 
operators, accountants and engineers. That contract has been the 
subject of allegations of attempted vote-rigging. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three union officials, including the council's vice  
president and associate director, have admitted they participated 
in or knew of a plan to rig the ratification vote. Hill asked 
several officials to resign when he learned of the plot and has 
said he notified the district attorney of the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	No date has been set for elections to fill the executive  
director post.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Shocked by Wells Departure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- David Wells was in tears. Joe Torre said his  
clubhouse was in shock. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cone, as always, managed to inject some humor into the  
situation following Thursday's trade of Wells, Graeme Lloyd and 
Homer Bush to Toronto for Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be a lot of bars going out of business in New  
York,'' Cone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells relished his biker-and-six pack image, especially since  
his perfect game against Minnesota last May made him the talk of 
the town and the talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about Boomer, he almost became a cult hero  
overnight,'' Cone said. ``Last year with the perfect game, he made 
his mark in Yankees history. He can be proud of that. He won't be 
forgotten. I'm sure there are mixed emotions among the fans. As 
soon as Rocket throws his first 15-strikeout night at Yankee 
Stadium people will be oohing and wowing, saying, `What a catch!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees turned what normally is a quiet day -- the first day  
of workouts for pitchers and catchers -- into a stunning event by 
obtaining the five-time Cy Young Award winner. The deal was 
announced less than hour before the Yankees opened spring drills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being around here for the four years, you get used to things  
like this,'' pitcher Andy Pettitte said. ``Stuff like this 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For an organization known for the unexpected, the quickness of  
the transition caught Wells' former teammates off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just another indication of how the business of baseball  
is these days,'' pitcher Mike Stanton said. ``We won 125 games, but 
you're still always looking to make yourself better. What can you 
say? It's one of those things that happens in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While players were sad to see Wells depart -- though they never  
took to his fondness for heavy metal -- they were excited about the 
imminent arrival of Clemens, who is due to report Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really neat,'' Pettitte said. ``Bringing him to a team  
like this, it's not going to do anything but help us. There's no 
doubt about it. When he's on the other team, you have to hate him 
... when he's on your team, I've heard nothing but great things 
about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One player losing a close friend is Japanese pitcher Hideki  
Irabu, who was befriended by Wells during spring training last 
year. Irabu said he would take Wells out to dinner when the Yankees 
visit Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since coming to the U.S., he was the first player to say `Hi'  
to me when I came in the clubhouse,'' Irabu said through an 
interpreter. ``He really helped me -- it was huge. I'm going to be a 
little more lonely and sad he is not here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Dunedin, Blue Jays manager Tim Johnson was please to be  
getting three players who will become keys for Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know that you're going to miss a guy like Roger, 'cause  
he's a Hall of Famer,'' Johnson said. ``Knowing him for quite a few 
years, he means a lot to me not only as a pitcher but as a person, 
so that loss is tough. But we got three players that are going to 
come in and help us. We gained a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There weren't many players at Blue Jays' camp, which doesn't  
officially start until Monday. One who was there was left-hander 
Steve Sinclair, who might go to Triple-A Syracuse because of the 
acquisition of Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little disappointed,'' Sinclair said. ``I'll just have  
to go into spring training and show them what I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Kissimmee, Atlanta manager Bobby Cox was happy about the  
trade -- for selfish reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was glad he stayed in the American League,'' Cox said. ``I  
didn't want to see Houston get him, or St. Louis, or anybody else 
for that matter.''

<HEADLINE> UNLV Center Kambala Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- UNLV center Kaspars Kambala will miss the rest  
of the season after undergoing surgery for torn cartilage in his 
right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors who did arthroscopic surgery late Wednesday found the  
damage to Kambala's knee was worse than initially feared and that 
he would not be able to play for eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-9 sophomore had a torn medial meniscus, trainer Dave  
Tomchek said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kambala injured his knee in the opening minutes of UNLV's 54-53  
win over Tulsa Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kambala was averaging 12.8 points and 6.5 rebounds per game.

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- Several thousand Indians who lost  
crops in Hurricane Mitch are suffering from a famine, officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moises Starkman, the minister of international cooperation, said  
a special government commission had been sent to the Atlantic Coast 
region to determine how to help 5,000 Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The region of Gracias a Dios province already had a poverty rate  
of about 80 percent even before the hurricane smashed into the 
region in October, killing at least 5,000 people in Honduras.

it was not enough. He called the problem ``grave'' but said no 
deaths had yet been reported due to hunger.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The slain husband of a Belgian-Italian

</P>
<P>
	A few friends and colleagues attended the funeral for Luis Reina  
Corbalan, a prominent lawyer. He was found naked and strangled with 
a bathrobe belt Wednesday at his home in Cuernavaca, just south of 
Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say they have no solid leads or motive. The home  
in the high-class Palmira neighborhood was in disarray, police 
said, but nothing appeared to have been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	His chauffeur, identified only as Juan Manuel Barrera Pina, has  
been detained for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Reina Corbalan, 59, a native of Argentina who had taught law at  
Morelos Autonomous University for more than two decades, was 
apparently estranged from his wife, Princess Marie Beatrice of 
Savoy, the daughter of Princess Marie Jose of Belgium and ex-King 
Umberto II of Italy.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Leftist rebels imprisoned in Peru will have  
more time in the sun after the government decreed Thursday they be 
allowed two hours a day in outdoor prison yards instead of one. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups called the measure ``positive'' but said  
more should be done to improve prison conditions in Peru. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 3,900 people convicted of terrorism or treason in  
Peru's prisons, according to government figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The government and leftist rebels have fought a bloody war that  
has left 30,000 dead since 1980, but the intensity of the war has 
dropped sharply since the capture of top rebel leaders in the early 
1990s.

	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Police and soldiers intensified the search  
Thursday for three gunmen who ambushed and killed a leading 
Ecuadorean opposition politician. 
</P>
<P>
	President Jamil Mahuad announced late Wednesday a $135,000  
reward for information leading to the capture of the killers of 
Jaime Hurtado, a Marxist congressman and former presidential 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurtado, 62, a vocal opponent of Mahuad's economic austerity  
plans, was shot Wednesday as he left Congress. Two assistants were 
also slain. 
</P>
<P>
	No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but members  
of Hurtado's leftist Popular Democratic Movement party blamed 
government supporters. Mahuad, a political centrist, has denied his 
government's involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurtado, who lost a presidential bid in 1984, will be buried  
Friday in the port city of Guayaquil, 165 miles southwest of Quito.

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Hundreds of residents in  
Argentina's capital blocked avenues, beat pots and threatened to 
sue the electricity company Thursday after a five-day blackout. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire in a power station Sunday left an estimated 250,000  
people without electricity and water in the middle of the southern 
hemisphere summer, with temperatures in the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls poured into radio stations from elderly people stuck in  
high-rise apartments who had to rely on sympathetic neighbors to 
bring them water from street faucets.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A Venezuelan man killed and then ate a  
person in a small Andean village, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they found two hands and a foot buried near the  
Dorangel Vargas' home in Tariba, 360 miles southwest of the 
capital, Caracas. Police believe he ate the rest of the body. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published in El Nacional newspaper Thursday,  
Vargas was quoted as saying he had eaten about 10 men. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a people eater. I'm mixed up in this because I'm  
destitute,'' he said. Asked if he was sorry, he said, ``No. On the 
contrary, I'm happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Vargas had been confined to a psychiatric institute  
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't eat women, he said, ``because they don't mess with  
anyone.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Gerald Dickler, a lawyer who represented artists  
and broadcasters, including some who were blacklisted in the 
McCarthy era, died Saturday at 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickler began his legal career in the 1930s, providing unpaid  
legal help to organize the first radio workers' union, a forerunner 
to the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s he joined others to buy an Albany radio station and  
a Durham, N.C., TV station. The outlets developed into Capital 
Cities Communications, which grew into a major media force that 
bought ABC in 1986. Capital Cities/ABC Inc. has since been bought 
by Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
	During the McCarthy era, Dickler represented radio and  
television personality John Henry Faulk, who was fired in 1955 amid 
allegations of Communist sympathies. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickler was chairman of the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, which he  
helped establish in 1985 under the will of Lee Krasner, widow of 
painter Jackson Pollock, to offer grants to struggling artists. Its 
last report listed assets of almost $50 million.

</P>
<P>
	Lipkey began organizing auto races in the early 1950s. On  
January 8, 1956, when USAC took over race sanctioning from the 
American Automobile Association, Lipkey set up the first USAC race,

</P>
<P>
	Later, he organized numerous races at the Coliseum and other  
area tracks, as well as at the Kokomo Speedway, which he secured in 
1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipkey also served for a number of years on the USAC advisory  
board as the race organizer representative. In 1983 he was 
presented the Jim Blunk Award in recognition of his contributions 
to the sport of midget auto racing.

	WELLESLEY, Mass. (AP) -- Thomas A. McMahon, biologist, novelist  
and designer of a running track, died Sunday following surgery. He 
was 55. 
</P>
<P>
	McMahon and a colleague designed the so-called ``tuned'' running  
track, a soft and springy track that has reduced injuries by half 
and improved running times by about 3 percent. When the track was 
used for the first time at Madison Square Garden, records were set 
in 11 of the 12 events. 
</P>
<P>
	McMahon, a biology professor at Harvard University, was  
considered an authority on the physics of animal locomotion. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1987 novel, ``Loving Little Egypt,'' won the Rosenthal Award

<HEADLINE> IRL May Lose Title Sponsors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- The Indy Racing League is facing the  
possibility of running more than half of its 1999 races without 
title sponsors for the events. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe's Motor Speedway is making plans to compensate for the  
expected loss of VisionAire Corp. as the top sponsor for its May 1 
race, sources told The Associated Press on Thursday on the 
condition that they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``No problems at all. This won't affect us running in any way,  
shape or form,'' said H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler, president of Speedway 
Motorsports Inc., the company that promotes five of the IRL's 11 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing VisionAire could mean six races on this year's schedule  
would be staged without title sponsors. Four of those races are at 
SMI-run tracks, including Lowe's as well as Atlanta Motor Speedway 
and Texas Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wheeler said the difficulty in attracting and retaining  
title sponsors is unlikely to prompt SMI to curb its interest in 
the fledgling series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've shown our commitment to the IRL, and I don't at  
this point see our commitment diminishing any,'' he said. ``The 
health and success of the IRL is going to have a major impact on 
auto racing in this country in the next decade because of the new 
tracks being built and the fact that a lot of them only have one 
Winston Cup weekend. So they need something else that's going to 
make them some money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of the suburban Charlotte track, an IRL crowd of  
about 50,000 is needed for the speedway to break even, Wheeler 
said. The inaugural VisionAire 500 drew a larger-than-expected 
gathering of more than 73,000 in 1997, but attendance slipped to 
about 50,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler said SMI was not officially notified that VisionAire is  
terminating its three-year contract, which is entering its final 
year. No such announcement is in the works, according to the 
Chesterfield, Mo.-based manufacturer of what it calls entry-level 
corporate jet airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Steve Goodhue said there have been discussions  
recently about the status of the sponsorship, but no decision has 
been made to withdraw it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still from our perspective the title sponsor of the  
VisionAire 500,'' Goodhue said Thursday night. ``It has been a 
tremendous venue for us the last couple years and we certainly have 
recognized some benefits from it. It is our intention to continue 
to be the title sponsor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, sources told the AP that IRL and SMI officials have  
begun to refer to the 1999 event as the Charlotte 500 and not the 
VisionAire 500 because they don't expect the company to back this 
year's race. 
</P>
<P>
	When a two-day tire test for IRL cars ended at the speedway  
Thursday night, the track issued a news release in which the 
upcoming race was repeatedly referred to as the Charlotte 500. 
VisionAire was not mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler said SMI was ready to seek new backers if the contract,  
which is worth about $500,000 a year, is terminated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd hate to see them pull out, but I'm not worried about it  
from the standpoint of being able to race,'' he said. ``We can make 
up for it.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The head of President Clinton's religious  
denomination, the Southern Baptist Convention, reacted harshly to 
Clinton's acquittal by the U.S. Senate, but other comments by 
denominational leaders have been more measured. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baptists' president, the Rev. Paige Patterson of  
Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C., 
called the decision ``a sad day for America.'' Patterson is a 
Clinton critic who had called for the president to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson said the vote sent the message that ``if you have  
money or prestigious position or both, your behavior can be totally 
irresponsible and reprehensible in the areas of sexual morality, 
truthfulness and faithfulness to personal covenants and 
commitments. ... We the people of the United States have sown the 
seeds of the dissolution of our republic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Clinton is a Baptist, he usually attends services with  
his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, who are Methodists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Felton May, bishop of the United Methodist Church in  
Washington, D.C., said ``an entire global culture, intertwined by 
commerce, media and technology, has been on trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bishop said ``we live in a world where consumption, hedonism  
and self-gratification have increasingly become normal and even 
celebrated. Addictive behaviors are only one consequence of such 
misplaced values.'' He added that ``by every indication, the 
president has grown spiritually as a result of this moral defeat 
and devastation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, presiding Bishop H. George Anderson of the  
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, with 5.2 million members, 
said, ``We have weathered a crisis that has tested our nation's 
system of checks and balances.'' He called for prayers ``for the 
many people who have been injured throughout this process.''

 *Forgo prejudice for Lent, church urges    	
</P>
<P>
	NAUGATUCK, Conn. (AP) -- Instead of giving up chocolate or  
television for Lent, the Congregational Church of Naugatuck is 
asking Christians to probe a little deeper. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're asking them to give up is prejudices,'' the Rev.  
Lee Moore, interim senior pastor, said. ``Obviously, (it is) with 
the hopes that this will carry over into the rest of their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore and his associate pastor are incorporating the theme into  
Sunday services during Lent, the 40 days of fasting and penitence 
between Ash Wednesday and Easter Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sermons and workshops are planned on confronting prejudices  
based on race, sex, religion or sexual orientation. Children's 
programs also will address prejudices against the disabled.

 *The priest who was mistaken for a felon    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An Episcopal priest was handcuffed and  
briefly detained in a case of mistaken identity as he left his 
church at the end of Sunday services. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Donald Culmer, who is black, came face to face with one  
of two black men being pursued by four officers. The officers 
surrounded the pair and, Culmer said, he was ordered to drop to his 
knees and was handcuffed. He was released within minutes after 
parishioners vouched for him. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers were operating under the assumption that the  
suspect may have had time to put the robes on, Los Angeles police 
Cmdr. David Kalish said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They dusted him off and sent him on his way,'' he added. ''  
... we apologize for any misunderstandings or embarrassments. They 
didn't know who was who.''

 *Pastor's family flees church fire    	
</P>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, Pa. (AP) -- A telephone call from a neighboring  
pastor saved the Rev. David Carr and his family from an early 
morning fire that gutted their church and parsonage. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr, his wife and their three teen-age children were asleep in  
the house attached to Bethel Life Church when the Rev. Vince 
Bellanca stepped onto his porch a block away as he let his dog out. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellanca saw flames shooting from basement windows of the church  
and rushed inside to call Carr and then 911. Carr said Bellanca's 
call awoke the family in time to escape as the fire quickly spread 
from the basement to the sanctuary and parsonage. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the fire appeared to be accidental, apparently  
started after a Bible study group meeting the night before failed 
to turn off two coffee pots in the church basement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how it could be rebuilt,'' Carr said, looking at  
the charred shell of the 76-year-old church about 65 miles 
northwest of Pittsburgh.

 *Pilgrims to 'walk on water'    	
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- You, too, can walk on water while retracing  
Jesus' footsteps in the Holy Land. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's National Parks Authority says it will build a submerged  
bridge into the Sea of Galilee that would allow tourists to 
simulate Jesus' miraculous walk on water. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeev Margalit, head of planning, said the authority's decision  
was based on a canvass of church officials and a review of the 
plans. He said he believed it would ``not hurt the feelings of the 
Christian tourists and it would not be too kitschy, so we decided 
to go with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bridge is one of many projects approved by Israeli  
authorities for the millennium, when 4 million pilgrims are 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The crescent-shaped bridge, 28 feet by 13 feet, will be 2 inches  
below water and will have no rails, to enhance the effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The site where Jesus is to have walked on water is at Capernaum,  
on the Sea of Galilee, actually a freshwater lake in north Israel. 
It has been a pilgrimage point since at least the third century and 
is marked by an ancient church. 
</P>
<P>
	The bridge, designed to hold 50 people, is to be finished in  
August.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Fires Chief of Tax Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin fired the chief of  
Russia's tax police today, the presidential press service said, 
apparently for his failure to curb widespread tax fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	A presidential spokesman wouldn't say why Col. Gen. Sergei  
Almazov was dismissed, but a recent government review found that 
the tax police's efforts to stop tax dodging were 
``unsatisfactory,'' according to the daily Kommersant newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent remarks to parliament, Almazov conceded that  
corruption plagued the tax police department. 
</P>
<P>
	Collecting taxes is a chronic problem in Russia and is the main  
reason the government is months behind in paying millions of state 
workers and pensioners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian media had been speculating that Almazov's days were  
numbered after he clashed with business tycoon Boris Berezovsky, a 
political insider with close ties to Yeltsin. Almazov sent the tax 
police to raid the office of an oil company owned by Berezovsky in 
early February. 
</P>
<P>
	Almazov, 55, was appointed to head the service in 1993 and spent  
most of his career with the KGB. Yeltsin did not immediately name a 
replacement for him. 
</P>
<P>
	In other economic news, inflation has totaled 10.6 percent so  
far this year, the State Statistics Committee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is hoping to keep inflation to 30 percent for the  
entire year, but most private economists say that target is 
unrealistic. Russian inflation was 85 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Dismisses Manlove </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Sophomore forward Tyron Manlove, who was  
suspended by Colorado coach Ricardo Patton 12 days ago, was 
dismissed from the team Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Manlove had been suspended for ``an attitude unbecoming a CU  
basketball player,'' but Patton provided no further explanation for 
his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the best interest of Tyron Manlove and the University of  
Colorado men's basketball program, this decision -- although 
unfortunate -- had to be made,'' Patton said Thursday after meeting 
with Manlove. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish Tyron well in his future endeavors, and we look  
forward to continuing on toward our own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of Manlove's suspension was made on Feb. 6, and  
he didn't play again for Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Manlove missed Colorado's first 10 games as he sat out as a  
transfer from Oregon. He scored 14 points in his first game with 
the Buffs and averaged 11.8 points in 12 games -- eight as a 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
	He lost his starting job after Patton criticized his defensive  
effort in Colorado's 76-52 loss at Kansas State on Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Manlove had a season-high 21 points against Boston University  
and matched that against Texas five days later.

<HEADLINE> Galarraga Stricken With Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Instead of starting spring training, Andres  
Galarraga is heading home to Florida to begin treatments for a 
cancerous tumor in his back. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta pitchers and catchers reported to camp in Kissimmee,  
Fla., Thursday, the same day the Braves learned that Galarraga was 
diagnosed with lymphoma of a bone in his lower back. He will miss 
the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Lee Kelley, a team orthopedist, who made the announcement,  
was optimistic that the 37-year-old Galarraga would be back playing 
baseball in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, it's isolated to a small bone in his lower back,  
and we expect his treatment to be successful,'' Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga will be released from Atlanta's Piedmont Hospital  
either today or Saturday and return to his West Palm Beach, Fla., 
home to undergo six months of treatment, which will include 
chemotherapy followed by radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga released a statement in his own handwriting, which  
read: 
</P>
<P>
	``To all my fans in Atlanta, Venezuela and around the country, I  
was looking forward towards the '99 season. Unfortunately, I'm hit 
with this setback. But, I promise you, I will be back. 
</P>
<P>
	``To my teammates, I will miss you all and try to return as fast  
as I can. I will be with you during all of our games in spirit and 
wish you all the best of luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the Braves organization. Thank you for all the calls and  
your sincere concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was signed: ``Su amigo, Andres Galarraga.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We are saddened by this news, but optimistic about the  
prognosis,'' Braves general manager John Schuerholz said from 
Kissimmee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knows what Andres means to the Braves on an off the  
field, but our main concern is his health and well-being,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad that he's out for the season, but it's a relief to  
know the cancer hasn't spread,'' manager Bobby Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Galarraga's diagnosis, the Braves were looking forward  
to a potent offense, one possibly even stronger than the one that 
hit a franchise-record 215 home runs last season, including 44 by 
Galarraga, a team record for a first baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	During the offseason, the Braves acquired outfielders Brian  
Jordan and Otis Nixon and traded for second baseman Bret Boone. 
Jordan hit .316 with 25 homers and 91 RBIs last season. Boone had 
24 homers and 95 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga will be replaced at first by Ryan Klesko, who has been  
the starter in left field, but played first in the minors. Klesko, 
who had a career-high 34 homers in 1996, had an off season in 1998, 
hitting .274 with only 18 home runs and 70 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon and Gerald Williams will platoon in left. Andruw Jones is  
in center, and Jordan in right. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our offense will be potent, but obviously not as potent  
without Andres. Otis will be playing a lot of left field and we 
feel good to have Klesko,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel very secure with Ryan at first base,'' Schuerholz  
said. ``We may have to address our depth in the future, but we feel 
fine for now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Kelley said Galarraga injured his back last fall, near the  
end of the season. A persistent pain remained, so he asked 
Galarraga to come to Atlanta earlier this month for an examination. 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI was taken and then a biopsy, revealing the cancer.  
</P>
<P>
	Kelley said lymphoma is a type of cancer involving a lymph cell.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is something that can be fairly isolated -- or fairly  
widespread. In this case, by all the studies we have, it is fairly 
isolated,'' Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, who signed a $24.75 million, three-year contract with  
the Braves before the 1998 season, also has played with Montreal, 
St. Louis and Colorado. He has a .290 career average with 332 
homers and 1,172 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Defends Ban on Sex Toys' Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- Any Wal-Mart can carry sexy nighties,  
body lotions and condoms like those Sherri Williams sells in 
Pleasures, her two ``romance'' stores. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the other stuff -- especially the vibrators in all shapes,  
colors and sizes -- that have her at odds with a new state law 
prohibiting the sale of sex toys. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge heard arguments Wednesday on a lawsuit filed by  
Ms. Williams and five other women seeking to overturn the 1998 ban, 
which they claim violates privacy rights by indirectly prohibiting 
adults from engaging in legal acts in their own bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The state, which argues such products are obscene, contends  
there is no ``fundamental right'' to an item used in the pursuit of 
sexual satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing before U.S. District Judge Lynwood Smith,  
attorney Mark Lopez of the American Civil Liberties Union argued 
against the ban. He said many sex therapists recommend sex toys for 
women who cannot achieve orgasm without them, and intruding into 
the privacy of bedrooms ``is not the role of the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the state contended Texas and Georgia have similar  
bans that have been upheld by courts, and legislators have broad 
discretion in passing laws to protect the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge gave no indication on when he would rule.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the statute, selling or distributing ``any obscene  
material or any device designed or marketed as useful primarily for 
the stimulation of human genital organs'' is a misdemeanor 
punishable by as much as one year in jail and a $10,000 fine. The 
law isn't being enforced pending the outcome of the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers, state attorneys argued there is no fundamental  
right ``to purchase a product to use in pursuit of having an 
orgasm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really a case about the power of the Legislature to  
prohibit the sale and manufacture of products it deems harmful,'' 
state Assistant Attorney General Courtney Tarver told the judge. 
``This statute does not prohibit the use of sexual devices. It does 
not prohibit the acquisition of them as gifts or from other 
states.''

<HEADLINE> Braves' Wohlers Not Yet in Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Mark Wohlers showed no sign Thursday that  
he has found a cure for his loss of control. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves right-hander hit two batters, nearly threw a  
ball over the batting cage and skipped a pitch six feet in front of 
home plate during his five minutes on the mound on the first day of 
spring training workouts for pitchers and catchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers said he felt confident throwing his breaking ball and  
splitter, but his fastball ``was not good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little nervous facing hitters for the first time,'' he  
said. ``It's a matter of getting out there and facing the fears and 
overcoming them. I feel frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny, you spend your entire life gripping a baseball and  
you turn around and the baseball has a grip on you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, the Braves' former closer, is trying to revive a  
once-promising career. It was less than a year ago that Wohlers, 
who had 97 saves from 1995-97, inexplicably lost the ability to 
throw strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a 10.18 ERA in Atlanta, with 33 walks and seven wild  
pitches in 20 1-3 innings. He tried to regain his form in the minor 
leagues, but that only made matters worse. At Triple-A Richmond, he 
was 0-3 with a 20.43 ERA, walking 36 and throwing 17 wild pitches 
in 12 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to work with him and we want him on our side,''  
manager Bobby Cox said. ``We're still thinking of everything we can 
possibly think of to get him on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went out there and got through the first day. Maybe that's  
a good step,'' Cox added. ``His control was erratic, but he got 
through it. We had some hitters stay in there and hit against him. 
I respect them for that, too, because that's hard to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers' teammates are equally concerned for him.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to support him,'' starting pitcher Greg Maddux  
said. ``Obviously he's our teammate, but he's also our friend. 
Because of those two things, you do everything you can to help 
support him. We all know we're a much better team with him on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen pitchers and three catchers from the 40-man roster  
reported for Thursday's workout, plus 10 non-roster invitees. The 
only scheduled pitcher who didn't show was Russ Springer, who is 
recovering from back surgery and is expected to report in 
mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux said he still looks for ways to improve his game this  
time of year, even if he has won four Cy Young Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're always trying to improve, even if it's just a little  
bit,'' he said. ``Sometimes just a little bit in this game goes a 
long way, so that's what you're always looking for.''

<HEADLINE> Falcons Release Cornelius Bennett </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The NFC champion Atlanta Falcons took the first  
step toward revamping their aging defense by releasing five-time 
Pro Bowler Cornelius Bennett, the team's leading tackler on the way 
to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The stunning move, announced Wednesday in a three-paragraph  
statement, opens an outside linebacker position for Keith Brooking, 
last year's No. 1 draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	By releasing Bennett, who will be 34 by the start of next  
season, the Falcons eliminated a salary that would have counted 
$3.7 million against the cap in 1999. He was entering the final 
season of a four-year, $13.6 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons are about $7 million under the projected salary cap  
for next season, providing plenty of financial room to address 
other needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Brooking adds youth to a defensive unit that had  
five starters over the age of 30. After a slow start, the rookie 
was playing regularly in passing situations by the end of the 
season, and he had eight tackles against Minnesota in the NFC 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a No. 1 draft choice we think can play and we've got  
to get him on the field,'' coach Dan Reeves told the Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution. ``Cornelius proved he can still play well, 
and this also gives him a chance to see what his market value is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Harold Richardson stressed that the decision to  
cut Bennett had nothing to do with any off-field problems, a touchy 
subject for the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety Eugene Robinson was accused of soliciting an undercover  
police officer for sex the night before the Super Bowl, and 
receiver Tony Martin was indicted on federal money laundering and 
conspiracy charges last week. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Bennett spent 35 days in a New York jail for sexual  
misconduct, but he returned to have his best season with the 
Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't anything extraordinary,'' Richardson said.  
``There's no hidden agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett's agent, Eugene Parker of Fort Wayne, Ind., did not  
return a telephone message left at his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Supposedly one of the NFL's most upstanding players, Bennett's  
reputation took a severe blow after a May 1997 sexual encounter in 
a Buffalo hotel room. The female victim was treated for trauma and 
skin cuts, and Bennett, who is married, pleaded guilty to sexual 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The linebacker entered counseling and became a born-again  
Christian. According to his teammates and coaches, he returned to 
the Falcons with a new outlook on life and became one of the 
leading figures in the improbable run to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett led the team with 121 tackles, ending Jessie Tuggle's  
nine-year streak in that category, and also broke up eight passes 
and recovered two fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett was a Pro Bowler during five of his nine seasons with  
the Buffalo Bills, establishing himself as one of the game's most 
dominating defensive players. He played in four straight Super 
Bowls with the Bills, who lost each time. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett became a five-time loser when Denver defeated the  
Falcons 34-19 in the title game 2 1/2 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to walk away from this game with a long face,''  
he said afterwards in the locker room at Pro Player Stadium. ``I'm 
a very special, very blessed athlete to have a chance to play in 
five Super Bowls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other moves Wednesday involving the Falcons, free-agent  
safety Devin Bush signed a four-year contract with the St. Louis 
Rams and offensive lineman Dave Widell was released along with 
Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, 25, was a first-round selection by the Falcons out of  
Florida State in 1995. He started 36 games for Atlanta but was 
relegated to a backup role this past season after the team signed 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Widell, 33, played only one game during his lone season with the  
Falcons. The 11-year veteran, who also has played with 
Jacksonville, Denver and Detroit, was inactive for the final 14 
games of the regular season and all three playoff games.

<HEADLINE> Daehlie Hopes To Overcome 30K Jinx </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMSAU, Austria (AP) -- There are few blemishes in the  
spectacular career of Bjorn Daehlie and they usually involve the 
30-kilometer event. When the Nordic Skiing World Championship opens 
Friday, the Norwegian superstar will be seeking to overcome the 
jinx. 
</P>
<P>
	The blemishes, in Daehlie's case, involve second-place finishes.  
But last year at the Nagano Olympics, Daehlie dropped to an 
embarrassing 20th place in the 30K after choosing the wrong wax. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a some problems historically in the 30K race, but  
still I'll try to be among the top finishers,'' Daehlie said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30K freestyle race will kick off the championship that ends  
Feb. 28. The women's 15K freestyle is also on Friday's program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, I am looking forward to the race,'' Daehlie said. ``But  
last week I was quite worried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daehlie, the most successful cross-country skier in history, was  
suffering from an inflammation of the vocal cords and skipped last 
weekend's 10K freestyle in Seefeld, Austria, the last World Cup 
race before the worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seefeld race was won by Mika Myllyla of Finland, the Olympic  
champion over the distance, but in the classical style. Second 
place in the Seefeld race went to Michail Botwinov, the 
Russian-born skier for Austria, while Jari Isometsa of Finland was 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the trio that Daehlie expected to provide the stiffest  
challenge to his effort to capture his first major 30K title since 
the 1993 worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	But Isometsa, who was fourth in Nagano, fell sick overnight with  
a flu and was very unlikely to race Friday, Finnish team officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	They said Isometsa would probably drop out of the other races as  
well if he is unable to compete Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from 1993, Daehlie has always come up short in a major 30K  
race: second in the 1995 and 1997 worlds, second at the 1992 and 
1994 Olympics. And then last year's disappointment in Nagano. 
</P>
<P>
	``The courses here are different from Nagano, they are not so  
demanding,'' he said. ``The uphills are not so steep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The first few kilometers will be the most difficult,'' Daehlie  
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Daehlie had to break off his high-altitude training in Italy  
last week. But he did a test race on the course of the 1994 
Olympics in Lillehammer, in his native Norway. ``I was not so fast 
as at the Olympics,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I feel my form is improving every day and I have been  
training well here,'' said the 31-year-old star. 
</P>
<P>
	If he can capture the 30K title, it will be another jewel in  
Daehlie's amazing trophy collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he bombed at the 30K in Nagano, Daehlie came back to  
win three gold medals, giving him a total of eight golds over three 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	That is three more than any man and two more than any other  
Winter Games competitor. Combined with his four silvers, he also 
has a total of 12 overall, two more than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	In five World Championships, Daehlie has a total of 15 medals,  
only two behind the record of Elena Vaelbe, the now retired Russian 
star. 
</P>
<P>
	He has won the overall World Cup title four times, has 45 career  
World Cup victories and leads this season's standings after four 
wins and two second places.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Faith Healers Get Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Nineteen months after a 22-month-old  
hemophiliac child bled to death in his mother's arms from a cut on 
his foot, his parents were sentenced to 17 years of probation for 
letting him die without medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean and Susan Heilman, who believe in prayer as the way to heal  
illnesses, pleaded no contest in October to involuntary 
manslaughter and child endangerment charges in the 1997 death of 
their son, Dean Michael. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Carolyn Engel Temin on Thursday ordered the Heilmans to  
immediately find a licensed pediatrician for their other two 
children, ages 1 and 5, and to get them medical insurance. She also 
fined the couple $2,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Heilman, 34, left the courtroom holding his Bible in one  
hand and his wife's hand in the other. Neither would comment to 
reporters, but their attorney Tom McGill said they would comply 
with the probation guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	The little boy had cut his toe on a piece of glass while playing  
in their back yard. His parents -- both raised as members of the 
Faith Tabernacle Congregation Church -- bandaged his foot, rocked 
the child and prayed. 
</P>
<P>
	When the youngster appeared weak and listless the next morning,  
the parents asked their pastor to follow their traditional 
faith-healing procedure of anointing their son with oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after Dean Michael stopped breathing 20 hours after the  
injury, his parents did not call for help or apply treatment, 
authorities said. Doctors testified that the boy's injuries were 
treatable. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said at least nine Pennsylvania children of  
Faith Tabernacle churchgoers have died of treatable illnesses since 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, however, said there was no malice by the Heilmans.  
</P>
<P>
	``The court is appalled that this little child bled to death for  
no reason,'' Temin said. ``And nothing I do is meant to condone 
that kind of treatment.... But the perpetrators are also the 
victims here.''

<HEADLINE> Battle Ends for Ex-Black Panther </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORGAN CITY, La. (AP) -- He was relieved, yes, but not excited.  
Elmer ``Geronimo'' Pratt knew this day would come. 
</P>
<P>
	Freed from a California prison in June 1997, the former Black  
Panther learned Wednesday that he is also free from the threat of 
being put back behind bars for a 1968 murder he has always said he 
didn't commit. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti said he would  
no longer try to prosecute Pratt for the slaying. A day earlier, a 
California appeals court refused to reinstate Pratt's original 
conviction, agreeing with a judge who said he had been denied a 
fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The L.A. DA had no leg to stand on in even appealing it in the  
first place,'' Pratt said, sitting in his sister's house in his 
native south Louisiana late Wednesday, playing with his toddler 
granddaughter, Ashaki. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke matter-of-factly, his voice betraying neither  
bitterness over his 27 years in prison nor a trace of the 
revolutionary fire associated with the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The celebration that we were here for 20 months ago should  
have been the final celebration,'' said Pratt, whose 1997 
homecoming was marked by a huge party of family and friends. ``It 
shouldn't have been appealed. It was a waste of taxpayers' money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1972 trial, Pratt was convicted of robbing and fatally  
shooting Caroline Olsen on a Santa Monica tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt claimed he was in Oakland for Black Panther meetings the  
day of the murder, and that FBI agents and police hid and possibly 
destroyed wiretap evidence that would prove it. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt's lawyers blamed his arrest on a politically charged  
campaign by J. Edgar Hoover's FBI against the Black Panthers and 
other perceived enemies of the U.S. government. The legal team 
waged a relentless campaign to free Pratt, winning numerous 
hearings only to be rebuffed repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	California Superior Court Judge Everett Dickey granted Pratt a  
new trial in 1997, saying the credibility of prosecution witness 
Julius Butler -- who testified that Pratt had confessed to him -- 
could have been undermined if the jury had known Butler was an 
ex-felon and police informant. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt was free.  
</P>
<P>
	That Garcetti, who inherited the case long after the trial,  
would continue to prosecute was just an example of a career 
prosecutor seeking publicity and political stature, Pratt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a Johnny-come-lately who evidently loves to grandstand on  
the media,'' Pratt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt, said he was relived prosecutors had ``finally come to  
their senses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I am not relieved in that they did not come clean all the  
way in exposing their complicity with this frame-up, this 27-year 
trauma,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Garcetti said it was his office which belatedly  
discovered the information about Butler and turned it over to the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Stuart Hanlon, who spent 25 years seeking Pratt's  
freedom, said he has filed a false conviction lawsuit in federal 
court on Pratt's behalf, seeking damages from the district 
attorney's office, the Los Angeles Police Department and the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcetti declined to say that Pratt may have been wrongly  
convicted, insisting that he stands behind the prosecutors who won 
a conviction in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was our job to review the facts,'' he said. ``What we did  
not find was any new evidence indicating he was innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trying the case again now would be fruitless, Garcetti said. The  
only eyewitness, the victim's husband, is dead.

<HEADLINE> Researchers: Volcanoes Ruled Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Mars may not be finished with its volcanic activity and up to 10  
times more lava was spewed onto the surface of the planet in 
ancient times than previously thought, scientists reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of two studies published in the journal Nature,  
researchers reported evidence that more than 3.5 billion years ago, 
Mars' volcanoes filled one canyon alone with enough molten rock to 
bury the United States beneath a fiery lake four miles deep. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence included more than 100 layers of what the  
researchers believe is volcanic rock jutting from the walls of the 
2,400-mile-long Valles Marineris canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like thick stacks of lava and it goes down as far as  
we can see,'' about six miles, said Alfred McEwen, a research 
scientist at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary 
Laboratory in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	He and colleagues studied photographs obtained by the Mars  
Global Surveyor, a spacecraft that has been orbiting Mars since 
1997 and begins a two-year mission next month to map the entire 
planet in fine detail. 
</P>
<P>
	The research supports the growing view that Martian volcanoes  
were more important than meteor collisions in shaping the planet's 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Volcanic activity would also help explain why Mars apparently  
had a thick, warm atmosphere early in its history. Volcanoes belch 
carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that causes the atmosphere to heat 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same journal, scientists from the Planetary Science  
Institute of Tucson reported that based on images radioed back by 
the surveyor, Mars' volcanoes -- one of which looms 14 miles above 
its dusty, windswept surface -- may not be finished erupting. 
</P>
<P>
	They examined photos of a lava flow in a volcanic crater and  
estimated it formed 40 million to 100 million years ago. The flow 
was marked with relatively few meteor craters, in contrast with 
older flows that were heavily pockmarked. That suggests the flow is 
relatively young. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not saying that there's going to be an eruption in 1999,  
but there may still be dormant areas on Mars with the potential for 
future eruptions,'' said William Hartmann, a scientist at the 
Planetary Science Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	He said researchers are analyzing photos that suggest even  
younger flows. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Squyres, a professor of astronomy at Cornell University  
helping plan NASA's 2001 rover mission to Mars, said he wouldn't be 
surprised if Mars were still volcanic. He noted that the Global 
Surveyor will produce a thermal map showing any surface hot spots.

<HEADLINE> Sport Federations Support Samaranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- The world's sports federations, led  
by the highest-ranking Olympic official implicated in the Salt Lake 
City bribery scandal, declared support Thursday for IOC president 
Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling council of the General Association of International  
Sports Federations called for the Olympic movement to ``maintain 
unity'' to overcome the biggest crisis in its history. 
</P>
<P>
	``During this difficult period .... GAISF's Council publicly  
announces its support and its trust within the International 
Olympic Committee and its president Juan Antonio Samaranch,'' a 
statement from the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement called on all parties to act in a ``calm and  
collected manner'' to help the Olympics ``get back on the tracks of 
progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GAISF is headed by Kim Un-yong, the powerful South Korean  
member of the IOC executive board and one of 24 IOC members linked 
to alleged misconduct in Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim was cited in separate investigations by the IOC and the Salt  
Lake independent ethics panel. He has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAISF statement was the second show of support for Samaranch  
by a major sports organization in two days. On Wednesday, the 
summer sports federations -- headed by track and field chief Primo 
Nebiolo -- said Samaranch is ``exceptionally qualified to navigate 
the IOC through these troubled waters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have numerous calls from outside the IOC, particularly  
from the media, for Samaranch to resign in connection with the 
widening corruption scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, some of the corporate sponsors who finance the  
Olympics have been critical of Samaranch while stopping short of 
demanding his resignation.

<HEADLINE> Astros Fail To Land Clemens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Roger Clemens bidding didn't end the way the  
Houston Astros wanted it to. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees acquired the five-time Cy Young Award  
winner from Toronto today for pitcher David Wells, infielder Homer 
Bush and reliever Graeme Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston general manager Gerry Hunsicker had talked with Blue  
Jays general manager Gord Ash as late as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had thought all along the deadline would be Thursday, Friday  
or this weekend,'' Astros owner Drayton McLane said. ``We 
aggressively worked through Gord Ash. We thought we were getting 
awfully close Tuesday and Wednesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ash had been trying to make a deal for Clemens since December.  
Hunsicker blasted Clemens' request for a $27.4 million, one-year 
extension, which would have essentially given him a $43.5 million, 
three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	While the salary issue appeared to be a major roadblock for the  
Astros, Clemens joined the Yankees without gaining an extension on 
his current deal, which has two years remaining at $16.1 million. 
He has the right to demand a trade following the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	McLane said he was confident Clemens would have played for the  
Astros under the same terms if Houston and Toronto had worked out 
an agreement, 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays reportedly wanted Astros outfielder Richard  
Hidalgo and pitcher Scott Elarton, two promising young players 
owner Drayton McLane was unwilling to give up. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens appeared to take himself off the market on Dec. 22 when  
he rescinded the Dec. 2 trade demand, which triggered talks with 
the Astros, Yankees, Cleveland Indians and Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	After Hunsicker criticized Clemens, the pitcher said he wouldn't  
play for the Astros as long as team president Tal Smith and 
Hunsicker remained. But Clemens later softened his stance. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, 36, won his second straight Cy Young Award last season  
after going 20-6 with a 2.65 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers general manager Doug Melvin had said Texas was still  
interested, too, but declined to elaborate. The Rangers attempted 
to acquire Clemens throughout December but they would not part with 
outfielder Rusty Greer.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Baker Settles In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- San Francisco Giants manager Dusty  
Baker glanced at the blackboard in his spring training office and 
slowly shook his head. The name of his third baseman the past two 
seasons, Bill Mueller, was misspelled as ``Miller.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ah, the pleasures of spring training.  
</P>
<P>
	Seven days after becoming a father for the second time, Baker  
settled into his office Thursday and prepared for the first workout 
of his pitchers and catchers on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Baker was glad to be back in a baseball setting.  
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't cooked and cleaned so much in a long time. And  
packed and unpacked,'' Baker said. ``I need this time and space to 
get totally into my baseball thinking. Every year at this time you 
have these thoughts and start formulating ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, whose team won the NL West two years ago and missed a  
wild-card spot last year when it lost a one-game playoff to the 
Chicago Cubs, knows his club faces a much improved division this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Diamondbacks added pitchers Randy Johnson and Todd  
Stottlemyre and centerfielder Steve Finley, while the Los Angeles 
Dodgers made Kevin Brown a $105 million pitcher. The Dodgers now 
have Davey Johnson as manager, and the Colorado Rockies hired Jim 
Leyland as their skipper. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants made no major free agent acquisitions, opting instead  
to re-sign veterans such as pitcher Mark Gardner and outfielder 
Ellis Burks, obtained from the Rockies in a trade last July. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's payroll will increase from about $43 million  
last season to $45 million this year, far less than the payrolls in 
places such as Arizona and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said it's comforting to be surrounded by players he's  
familiar with, and who are familiar with his managing style, but 
said that's not the only reason the team didn't make big changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of it is we don't have the money that other people  
have,'' he said. ``It's not a matter of comfort, it's a matter of 
dealing with reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Baker's lineup is set. Barry Bonds is in left field,  
Burks is in right if his knees are OK. J.T. Snow is at first, Jeff 
Kent at second, Rich Aurilia at short and Mueller at third. Center 
field and catcher are up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner, Shawn Estes and Kirk Rueter will be the top three  
starting pitchers, with Russ Ortiz and Trevor Wilson among those 
competing for the other two spots in the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team, most of it is pretty set,'' Baker said. ``But we're  
always looking for a couple of surprises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such as the spelling of his third baseman's name.

<HEADLINE> Mandatory Hepatitis Shots Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A federal health group wants 11 Western states  
with a high incidence of hepatitis A to require that children be 
vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
	Children are one of the highest risk groups for hepatitis A, the  
Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's advisory 
committee on immunization said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee recommended that states with at least 20 cases out  
of every 100,000 people -- twice the national average for hepatitis 
A cases between 1987 and 1997 -- implement routine vaccinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Those states currently are Arizona, Alaska, California, Idaho,  
Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vaccinating children against hepatitis A is one of the most  
effective -- and cost-effective -- strategies for building long-term 
immunity against hepatitis A and preventing further spread of the 
disease,'' said Thelma King Thiel, chairman and chief executive of 
the Hepatitis Foundation International in Cedar Grove, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Hepatitis A, a highly contagious virus that affects the liver,  
is spread by personal contact when hands aren't washed after 
bathroom use or by contaminated food or water. It infects as many 
as 200,000 Americans and costs the nation more than $450 million 
annually, the foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
	Primary symptoms include jaundice, fatigue, flu-like illness  
with high fever, chills, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 30 percent of those cases occur in children 15 or  
younger. 
</P>
<P>
	Children do not always exhibit symptoms of hepatitis A, but can  
transmit it to adults who tend to develop more severe symptoms.

<HEADLINE> NBC Holds Lead in February Sweeps / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was just like old times for NBC, with people  
staying at home on a Thursday night, glued to their TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
	The network's powerhouse Thursday schedule, frayed a bit from a  
loss of viewers this season, rebounded with strong numbers last 
week to help NBC maintain a lead during the crucial February 
``sweeps'' period. 
</P>
<P>
	All five of NBC's Thursday shows bettered their season averages,  
led by ``ER.'' The medical drama was the week's most popular show 
as viewers flocked to George Clooney's penultimate appearance as a 
series regular. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, NBC had a 9.9 rating and 16 share, Nielsen Media  
Research said Wednesday. CBS was second with a 9.4 rating and 15 
share, followed by ABC's 7.9 rating and 13 share and Fox's 6.7 and 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	The second part of NBC's miniseries, ``The '60s,'' finished in  
eighth place for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Part one of ABC's Stephen King miniseries, ``Storm of the  
Century,'' finished in 10th place for the week. That's not as 
strong as past King-based series and was second in its time slot to 
CBS's movie, ``Deep in My Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC also received criticism for running ``Storm of the Century''  
advertisements in a crawl beneath other prime-time programs, 
confusing some viewers who thought they were seeing a special news 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	While NBC's new ``Providence'' continues to shine, the news  
isn't so good for two CBS midseason replacements. ``Turks'' and 
``Magnificent Seven'' were both deep in the ratings pack. 
</P>
<P>
	The fledgling WB network had a 3.7 rating and 6 share for the  
week, recording the most total viewers of any week in its history. 
The WB family comedy, ``7th Heaven,'' finished with a bigger 
audience than any other series ever on the network. UPN had a 2.1 
rating and 3 share, while Pax TV was at 0.7 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' took back control of the evening news  
race after two weeks of domination by ABC's ``World News Tonight.'' 
NBC had an 8.7 rating and 17 share in the week President Clinton's 
impeachment trial ended, and ABC had an 8.2 and 16. The ``CBS 
Evening News'' was at 7.7 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Feb. 8-14, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``ER,'' NBC, 21.7; ``Friends,'' NBC, 17.8; 
``Frasier,'' NBC, 17.4; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 14.9; ``Veronica's 
Closet,'' NBC, 14.9 ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 14.4; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 14.4; ``NBC Movie of the Week: The '60s, Part Two,'' 
NBC, 13.4; ``CBS Sunday Movie: Deep in My Heart,'' CBS, 13.1; 
``Storm of the Century,'' ABC, 12.3.

<HEADLINE> Crude Up on Refinery Shutdown Rumors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures moved sharply higher Thursday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange amid market talk refiners planned to shut down 
larger facilities as profit margins continue to dwindle in the face 
of a worldwide oil glut and weak demand. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, platinum and palladium futures also rose  
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude and its products bounced in a market swept by  
unsubstantiated talk that Tosco Corp. planned to shut its huge 
Marcus Hook, Pa., refinery in conjunction with a maintenance 
shutdown of its giant Bayway, Texas, 145,000-barrel-a-day 
gas-making unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil prices have hovered near 12-year lows as investors  
worry about continued world overproduction and weak demand from 
Asia, Russia and Latin America, which has caused producers to ship 
much of their supplies to the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The low prices have led to increasing speculation that American  
refiners will use the lull between the end of the winter heating 
period and start of the summer driving season to perform necessary 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tosco said after trading had ended that the  
190,000-barrel-a-day Pennsylvania refinery was at normal 
operations, and indicated there are no immediate plans to shut all 
or part of it for maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude also was supported by sharply higher unleaded gasoline  
prices. Gas rose after the American Petroleum Institute reported 
late Wednesday that inventories fell a surprising 0.5 percent last 
week even as refineries boosted production to meet demand for the 
summer driving period. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline signaled much stronger than expected demand well  
before the heaviest usage months, providing good news at a time 
when prices have tumbled in a world awash in cheap oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for March delivery rose 51 cents to $12.04 a  
barrel; March unleaded gasoline rose 1.35 cents to 34.42 cents a 
gallon; March heating rose 1.14 cents to 30.98 cents a gallon; 
March natural gas fell 3 cents to $1.746 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures fell to new 12-year lows on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange amid indications already ample world supplies 
are growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Escondida, the world's largest copper mine, located in Chile and  
owned by Broken Hill Proprietary Co., reported production jumped 29 
percent in January, to 87,584 metric tons versus 67.764 metric tons 
a year ago. The large increase is a sign that producers are content 
to ship more product at lower prices rather than reduce shipments 
in the hopes of boosting profits down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper inventories have soared because of extremely weak demand  
in Asia, which had been supported oversupply for years during a 
construction boom. Copper is used in electronics and plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
	March copper fell 1 cent to 61.75 cents a pound, the lowest  
since April 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Platinum and palladium rose sharply on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange in the face of continued shipping delays from Russia, 
which is the world's largest producer of palladium and 
second-largest producer of platinum behind South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	April platinum rose $10.70 to $376.10 an ounce; March palladium  
rose $13.90 to $358 an ounce.

<HEADLINE> Albright To Join Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Threatening force but still trying diplomacy,  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright plans to join Kosovo 
negotiations in France only hours before Saturday's deadline for a 
settlement to the yearlong war in the Serbian province. 
</P>
<P>
	All week, Albright has been threatening Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic with NATO bombardment if he holds out against a 
six-nation plan for ethnic Albanian self-rule in Kosovo or 
continues his refusal to let NATO deploy peacekeepers to ensure the 
plan, once agreed to, is carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	Her arrival at Rambouillet, southwest of Paris, on Saturday,  
just before the noon deadline, raises the possibility the clock 
could be stopped and negotiations extended if the Serbs give enough 
ground in the final hours to enhance prospects for settlement. The 
deadline corresponds with 6 a.m. Saturday, Washington time. 
</P>
<P>
	Her plans beyond a day at the 14th-century chateau in  
Rambouillet were not disclosed and probably have not been made. One 
possibility, a senior U.S. official said, is that if no accord is 
struck she would go to NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, to 
talk to the allies about attacking the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Engaging in her now-familiar strategy of mixing threats of force  
with diplomacy, Albright said Thursday that Milosevic, with whom 
she had just spoken on the telephone, ``should understand that if 
airstrikes occur, they will be hard, and he will be deprived of the 
things that he values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of sea-launched Tomahawk missiles would hit Serb  
air-defense sites and radar facilities first, then key command 
centers and barracks in what would likely be a limited NATO strike, 
Pentagon planners said. They cautioned, however, that a more 
aggressive attack plan also was being considered. 
</P>
<P>
	Planning was under way, meanwhile, to evacuate the 130 American  
diplomats and dependents in Yugoslavia and to assist departures of 
4,000 other Americans living there. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans also are being made to withdraw the 1,300 international  
monitors in Kosovo to try to deter conflict between Serb troops and 
the independence-minded Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek of Norway, whose government  
now heads the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
said after meeting with Albright at the State Department that ``we 
still hope for a political settlement on Saturday. We expect 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan being forced on the Serbs and Albanians by the United  
States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia, would depend on 
28,000 NATO troops, about 4,000 of them Americans, to see that 
weapons are surrendered and a way is cleared to elections for 
self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are at the stage where we need to exert utmost  
pressure, maximum pressure on the parties in this final phase,'' 
Vollebaek said. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 51 U.S. warplanes ordered to the region were due  
to arrive this weekend or early next week. Already at European 
bases are 220 aircraft, and the USS Enterprise is in the 
Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen F-117 stealth fighters, which can evade Serb radar, were  
among the freshly ordered warplanes as well as 10 EA-6B electronic 
warfare planes and 29 refueling planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional U.S. aircraft, including bombers, have been ordered  
to stand by in case they are needed, Defense Secretary William 
Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night, Cohen ordered six U.S. B-52 bombers to fly to  
the Royal Air Force's Fairford Base in Britain this weekend to 
augment other aircraft in NATO's strike force. Pentagon spokesman 
Ken Bacon called the action ``a purely precautionary measure'' but 
added that the order directs the bomber crews to ``be prepared to 
execute their mission within 48 hours of arrival.''

<HEADLINE> Biogen To Make New Version of Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Biogen, a leading biotech company, signed a deal  
Wednesday with Inhale Therapeutic Systems to develop an inhaled 
version of its market leading multiple sclerosis drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Avonex, which is Biogen's only approved drug, is now taken by  
injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the agreement, Biogen will pay Inhale  
royalties on product sales, an up-front signing fee and an 
estimated $25 million for research funding. Biogen will be 
responsible for human testing, marketing and commercialization. 
</P>
<P>
	Multiple sclerosis leads to degeneration of nerve cells in the  
brain and spinal cord, resulting in disturbances in vision, muscle 
weakness and increasing disability over time. Multiple sclerosis 
affects an estimated 1.1 million people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Avonex slows the progression of the disease. Worldwide, more  
than 55,000 multiple sclerosis patients take Avonex, which last 
year had sales of $395 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Inhale last year signed a contract with Pfizer Inc. to develop  
an inhaled form of insulin for diabetics.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Slip in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen in early  
trading Friday following its strength overseas. Prices on the Tokyo 
Stock Exchange moved lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.74 yen in early trading, up 1.06 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo but slightly below its level of 119.81 yen 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average fell 54.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to  
14,092.62 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Thursday, the 
index slipped 11.88 points, or 0.08 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's strength followed its rise in  
New York, where it briefly broke through 120 yen for the first time 
since Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at 133.82 yen, up 0.02 yen from late  
Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices fell despite gains earlier on Wall  
Street mainly because of selling by institutional investors ahead 
of the March 31 fiscal year-end, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 103.16,  
closing at 9,298.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were also cautious ahead of the Group of Seven finance  
ministers meeting later in the week in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors have adopted a wait-and-see attitude ahead of the  
G-7 meeting'' to confirm the direction of the yen, said Akira 
Nakamura, manager at Chuo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 3.50 points, or 0.32 percent, to 1,091.77. 
The TOPIX had shed 1.81 points, or 0.16 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.860  
percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.875 percent, driving its price 
up to 99.52 yen from 99.40.

<HEADLINE> Study: Pesticides Too High for Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some fruits and vegetables have pesticide  
residues that could be unsafe for young children, and the 
government is not doing enough about it, claims a Consumer Reports 
study released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Children subjected to the pesticides may be vulnerable to  
neurological damage and abnormal hormonal activity, according to 
the study, which offered no clinical proof of such harm. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in the March issue, said peaches, winter  
squash, apples, green beans, pears and spinach have the highest 
levels of pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists were quick to discredit the study.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is nonsense,'' countered Bruce Ames, professor of  
biochemistry at the University of California in Berkeley. Focusing 
on ``minuscule'' levels of pesticide residues, he said, ``is a 
distraction from something far more important -- feeding kids fruits 
and vegetables that prevent cancer and other diseases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Groth, an environmental biologist at Consumers Union,  
which publishes Consumer Reports, said the findings don't mean 
parents should stop giving their children produce. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``parents might want to be careful about the  
amounts and types of fruits and vegetables they serve their 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer Reports relied on data collected by the U.S. Department  
of Agriculture, focusing on 27,000 samples of 27 food categories 
tested from 1994 to 1997, both domestic and imported. The effects 
of various chemicals were assessed on how they would affect a 
44-pound child, usually an average 5-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all the foods fell within legal limits for pesticide  
residue. However, the government has stricter recommendations for 
what is officially defined as safe -- without appreciable health 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those standards, U.S.-grown peaches in the study contained  
up to 125 times the levels of the farm chemical methyl parathion 
than the government deems safe for a 44-pound child. The law allows 
twice that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Environmental Protection Agency is now implementing  
the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act, which requires it to 
reexamine all pesticides and tighten exposure limits to make them 
safer for younger children. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Groth said, parents should avoid giving their  
children large amounts of the foods with the highest toxicity 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Produce such as apples, peaches, pears and green, leafy  
vegetables should be peeled, or even washed ``with a very diluted 
dishwashing detergent,'' according to the Consumers Union, a 
Yonkers, N.Y.-based nonprofit testing and information-gathering 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Foods with the lowest toxicity include canned or frozen sweet  
corn, milk, orange juice, broccoli, imported bananas and apple 
juice. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also recommends buying organically grown produce,  
which Consumers Union says has little or no residue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Reports study does not examine the possible effects  
of pesticides on adults.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Mayor Could Coast to Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The big snowfall that blanketed Chicago seven  
weeks ago and crippled the mass transit system for days could have 
been serious trouble for Mayor Richard M. Daley. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, angry Chicago commuters threw Mayor Michael Bilandic  
out of his job over a snowstorm fiasco 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley not only rode out the storm but, going into Tuesday's  
election, appears headed for an easy victory despite problems 
ranging from City Hall corruption to concerns about police 
brutality. 
</P>
<P>
	The 56-year-old son of Chicago's legendary Boss, Mayor Richard  
J. Daley, holds a huge lead in the polls over challenger Bobby Rush 
in his bid to win a third full term as mayor of the nation's 
third-largest city. Both candidates are Democrats; there are no 
Republicans in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Daley can be beaten and I don't think that he  
ought to be,'' declares GOP activist Tom Roeser. ``I personally 
feel that he is the best mayor in the country. The schools are 
going in the right direction. We're reclaiming the neighborhoods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rush, 51, a four-term congressman who was a Black Panther leader  
in the radical 1960s but has long since joined the mainstream, has 
been looking in vain for an issue big enough to stop Daley. 
</P>
<P>
	He grumbles that Daley's drive to upgrade the ailing public  
schools -- praised by President Clinton as a model for the nation -- 
is largely hype and that Daley's handpicked schools chief is ``the 
P.T. Barnum of public education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daley forces scoff at that notion, pointing to higher scores on  
standardized tests since the mayor took charge of the schools four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley has had his share of storms.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the last two years, five aldermen have been convicted on  
federal payoff charges and a sixth awaits trial. A host of small 
fry at City Hall and elsewhere in Daley's empire have been 
convicted of payroll padding. The city treasurer -- not a Daley ally 
-- has been charged with extortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of an elite anti-drug police unit have been convicted in  
federal court of a drug conspiracy -- one turned out to be a member 
of the Vice Lords street gang. And two officers were fired for 
beating a teen-age suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Rush has been quick to capitalize, saying, ``A police culture  
which permits harassment, cover-ups and the false arrest of our 
young people has flourished.'' Daley backers say most of the 13,000 
officers do a good job. 
</P>
<P>
	Only once did scandal come close to touching the mayor, when one  
of his closest City Council allies -- Alderman Patrick Huels -- 
resigned after it was disclosed that he helped to get a city 
subsidy for a contractor who gave him a $1.2 million loan. The 
contractor was also a friend of Daley. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I've been too lax,'' the normally outgoing and  
combative-sounding Daley said in a rare moment of public 
soul-searching. He proceeded to push two ethics-tightening 
ordinances through the council. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley supporters say that with Chicago's economy in good shape,  
most voters are not inclined to worry about such matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the economy, stupid!'' guffaws Alderman Richard Mell.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a livability factor that's higher than it's ever been,  
which gives rise to an economy that's booming in Chicago,'' says 
Mell, an old-school holdover from the era when Daley's father ran 
the Chicago Machine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Machine is gone, the city has changed and the current Daley  
is anything but a carbon copy of his father. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Daley rolled up his election victories behind an army  
of doorbell-ringing precinct captains who did favors in exchange 
for votes. Like most modern mayors, the new Daley does most of his 
campaigning in TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The old Daley prided himself on building a mass transit system,  
expressways and a giant airport. The new Daley is best known for 
managing the schools and a city beautification drive that has lined 
some downtown streets with giant concrete flower pots. Voters 
clearly like it. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Daley has served 10 years in office to his father's  
21. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent Chicago Tribune poll, published Feb. 12, shows  
Daley with 65 percent to just 13 percent for Rush and 1 percent for 
another candidate, with 20 percent undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a majority to get elected mayor in Tuesday's  
nonpartisan election. In the unlikely event that neither candidate 
gets more than 50 percent, the contest will be decided in a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley is already talking about plans for his next term.  
</P>
<P>
	``The key from my perspective is the schools,'' he says. ``That,  
from my point of view, is the heart and soul of the city.''

<HEADLINE> Deere To Extended Summer Shutdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOLINE, Ill. (AP) -- Deere &AMP; Co. will extend its summer plant  
shutdowns by up to five weeks due to a bigger-than-expected decline 
in demand for farm equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're responding to the marketplace,'' Deere spokesman Ken  
Golden said Thursday. ``Retail demand for farm equipment in North 
America we now predict to be declining by 25 percent this year. 
Just three months ago we were talking about 20 percent. So, it 
continues to weaken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Deere reported a 75 percent drop in  
first-quarter profits from a year ago. Golden said the decision to 
extend the regular vacation shutdowns has less to do with profits 
and more to do with the level of inventory owned by Deere and in 
dealer showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are attempting to match our production with customer  
demand,'' he said. Demand for combines and large tractors has 
fallen sharply from a year ago as farmers try to cope with 
commodity prices driven down by a glutted global marketplace at a 
time of financial turmoil in Asia, Russia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,400 employees at the Harvester Works in East Moline will  
be out of work for three weeks in May and again for two weeks at 
the end of July. That July shutdown leads into the plant's annual 
shutdown, which runs July 26 to Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seeding Group in Moline, with 280 factory workers, will shut  
down from May 3 to the end of the month. The company had also 
previously announced that its plant north of Des Moines, Iowa, 
which makes cotton-harvesting equipment, would shut down four 
separate weeks of the summer.

<HEADLINE> Ole Miss Coach Has Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXFORD, Miss. (AP) -- David Cutcliffe, who coached Mississippi to  
an Independence Bowl victory in his debut despite a painful case of 
pancreatitis is recovering from gall bladder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutcliffe underwent surgery Wednesday at Baptist Memorial  
Hospital-North Mississippi to have his gallbladder removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Todd Threadgill said Cutcliffe was recently diagnosed with a  
chronic dysfunction of his gall bladder which ``was causing 
recurrent bouts of pancreatic inflammation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Threadgill said he anticipated a rapid and full recovery for  
Cutcliffe. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutcliffe, who was named the Ole Miss coach on Dec. 2, was first  
hospitalized in Knoxville, Tenn., during Christmas week. He 
rejoined the team in obvious pain, but led the Rebels to a 35-18 
victory over Texas Tech in the Independence Bowl on New year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutcliffe returned to the hospital last week after more  
inflammation of his pancreas. 
</P>
<P>
	Before taking over at Ole Miss, Cutcliffe was the offensive  
coordinator at Tennessee, where he was an assistant coach for 16 
years.

<HEADLINE> Criticized Klein Ad Is Pulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An ad campaign featuring children romping in  
Calvin Klein underwear has been pulled in the face of critics who 
called it pornographic and threatened to boycott the designer's 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	A gigantic billboard showing children jumping on a sofa was to  
be unveiled today in Times Square, but the company said late 
Wednesday that the entire campaign would be discontinued 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``The comments and reaction that we have received today raised  
issues that we had not fully considered,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	A black and white photograph of the promotion, showing two boys  
in briefs, was published in full-page newspaper ads Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the campaign to launch Calvin Klein underwear  
for kids was ``intended to show children smiling, laughing and just 
being themselves.' 
</P>
<P>
	But critics said the ads went too far, even in Times Square,  
where advertisements often include scantily clad models promoting 
anything from bras to socks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether you like it or not, you have pedophiles in this  
society. Anything that could get them excited is detrimental, 
irresponsible and reckless,'' said Donald Wildmon, president of 
American Family Association in Tupelo, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the picture is ``nothing more than pornography.''  
</P>
<P>
	Talk show host Rosie O'Donnell blasted the ad during a live  
taping of her show. ``I'll never wear his underwear again,'' she 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Yenelouis of the International Center for Photography in  
New York said the advertisement was ``a very ordinary image,'' 
similar to family snapshots, and ``it has a sense of nostalgia and 
classicism that removes it from ... being a snapshot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Robert Peters, president of New York-based Morality in  
Media, said it wasn't that simple. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can envision this photograph taken by accident -- an  
innocent photo taken by a mom. But at Calvin Klein nothing is 
innocent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1980 Calvin Klein ad featured 15-year-old Brooke Shields  
saying ``Nothing comes between me and my Calvins.'' In the early 
1990s, Klein pioneered the ``heroin chic'' look that made model 
Kate Moss a star. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1995 jeans ad campaign featured models as young as 15 in  
provocative poses and settings. It drew fire from President Clinton 
and child welfare groups. Klein pulled that ad, but issued a new 
one a few months later showing model Joel West in briefs, his legs 
spread wide. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who championed the cleanup of Times  
Square, had said there was nothing the city could do about Klein's 
children billboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``The First Amendment allows a whole range of expression,'' he  
said, adding: ``I think it was done on purpose, and I think it's in 
very bad taste.''

<HEADLINE> Vaughn Appears at Training Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Mo Vaughn, working out on his own in nearby  
Phoenix for the last 2 1/2 weeks, attended the Anaheim Angels' 
training camp for the first time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn, who hit .320 and averaged 39 homers and 120 RBIs for the  
Boston Red Sox during the past four years, said he will start 
working out with the Angels when position players are required to 
report next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, he said he will take batting practice inside the  
team's batting cages at the Diablo Stadium facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to come by and say hello to the fellas, and let them  
know the work starts now,'' said Vaughn, a free agent first baseman 
who signed an $80 million, six-year contract with the Angels in 
November. ``I wanted to show them that I'm eager to get things done 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn was greeted by many of the team's veterans, including  
catcher Charlie O'Brien and outfielders Tim Salmon and Jim Edmonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the rookies asked for his autograph.  
</P>
<P>
	Starting pitcher Ken Hill breathed a sigh of relief when he saw  
Vaughn by his locker accepting greetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I don't have to face you now,'' said Hill, who  
appears healthy after undergoing elbow surgery last June. ``You 
took a lot out of me the last three years or so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn had a significant presence in the clubhouse, and it went  
beyond his bulky size at 6-foot-1 and 240 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``His presence and his work habits, the way you should go about  
your job, will impact the guys the most,'' Angels manager Terry 
Collins said. ``I don't want him to think he has to deliver a pep 
talk. We got him to hit, but during the season, if he feels like he 
should say something, he will.''

<HEADLINE> Politicians Visit George W. Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- In what is becoming almost a daily routine,  
politicians from across the country and beyond are trooping to 
Austin to pay homage to Gov. George W. Bush and, in many cases, 
urge him to run for president. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the Republican governor received visits from  
legislators from Iowa and New Jersey. The lieutenant governor of 
South Carolina stopped by. He has had his brain picked by the 
leader of Britain's Conservative Party, met with the president of 
Argentina and been called on by the ambassador from Qatar. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had been scheduled for an  
overnight stay but canceled at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen anything like this,'' said George Christian,  
an Austin political consultant who was press secretary to President 
Lyndon Johnson. ``They're looking for a winner, is what this comes 
down to. Many Republicans around the country look at the list of 
people out there already running, and they don't see a winner 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush insists he hasn't made up his mind about running in 2000,  
although he said this week, ``I'm warming to the task.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen legislators from Iowa -- which holds the nation's first  
presidential nominating caucuses -- visited Bush two weeks ago. On 
Wednesday, Bush met three leaders of the New Jersey Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came down here wanting to listen to what George W. Bush had  
to say, to look him in the eye and size him up. I've decided to be 
a supporter,'' said Diane Allen, majority whip of the New Jersey 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex DeCroce, deputy speaker of the New Jersey Assembly, said  
Bush's election successes make him a more appealing candidate than 
a potential New Jersey hopeful, publisher Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve Forbes, we don't know if he's electable. We know this  
governor's electable. We know he's reached out to the people,'' 
DeCroce said.

	Texas Democrats question whether Bush is devoting too much  
attention to the out-of-state visitors and not enough time to his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is bound to be enjoying all this attention that he's  
getting. But he has to be spending time with these people and we 
are in the middle of a 140-day legislative session,'' said state 
Democratic Party chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm. ``He needs to be 
paying attention to Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's staff says the governor is busy pushing his legislative  
agenda, including property, business and consumer tax cuts, and 
meeting with state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has also been meeting with potential campaign donors,  
policy experts and others. 
</P>
<P>
	After ousting popular Democrat Ann Richards in 1994, the eldest  
son of former President Bush won re-election last November with 69 
percent of the vote in the nation's second-largest state. He and 
his brother Jeb, governor of Florida, espouse what is being called 
``compassionate conservatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, British Conservative Party leader William Hague  
visited Bush at the state Capitol to discuss ideas that might help 
boost his party's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of my objective to make sure that conservative  
politics in Britain is more open and inclusive to people who have 
not been associated with conservative politics in the past,'' Hague 
said. ``The governor has certainly succeeded in doing that here in 
Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush alternates between seriousness and good humor when  
discussing all the attention he's getting. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I run, I'd like to have their support. I know how important  
Iowa is,'' Bush said after that meeting. Of the visit from the 
Qatar ambassador, he said: ``The speculation has seemed to cause 
more governments to send their ambassadors my way.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. Smokers' Lawsuit Buried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- First, there were the witnesses, dramatic  
cross-examinations and depositions. Now, an avalanche of paperwork 
has stalled the nation's first class-action lawsuit by smokers to 
reach trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Rosenblatt, along with his wife and law partner, Susan,  
want thousands of documents admitted into evidence to show what 
they say is a pattern of deception by cigarette makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rosenblatts represent an estimated half-million Florida  
residents who blame smoking for their illnesses and want at least 
$200 billion in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for tobacco companies and industry groups -- who say  
smokers knew the habit was risky when they started and could quit 
if they tried -- don't want to start their presentation until they 
know exactly what evidence the plaintiffs will make available to 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	But the process of examining and arguing about each memo,  
letter, report or speech, some dating back to the 1940s, seems to 
be taking a toll. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at these documents and say why so many?'' Circuit Judge  
Robert Kaye said Wednesday, the fifth day devoted to reviewing 
documents. ``Nobody's going to read all this stuff. I don't even 
think an appellate court would read it. 
</P>
<P>
	``You say, well, the evidence is overwhelming,'' he said to the  
Rosenblatts. ``There's three tons of paper here. That's 
overwhelming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury has not been in the courtroom for more than a week.  
</P>
<P>
	Rosenblatt told the judge that jurors in other tobacco cases  
consistently said the documents were crucial to their decisions in 
favor of plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the  
Florida defendants are Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard 
Tobacco Co., Liggett Group Inc., and Miami's Dosal Tobacco Corp., 
as well as the Council for Tobacco Research and the Tobacco 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Years of tobacco litigation have revealed millions of pages of  
industry documents being made public. Many came from a Minnesota 
case, which went to closing arguments before the industry settled 
for $6.6 billion last May. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are literally millions of documents in the Minnesota  
case,'' said Dick Daynard, a Northeastern University law professor 
and anti-tobacco activist. 
</P>
<P>
	``They cover what the industry knew and when it knew it,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Mrs. Rosenblatt introduced a memo in which a tobacco  
company attorney reported asking a scientist whose rats had 
developed emphysema during a tobacco experiment to interpret his 
data differently. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to do that?'' Kaye asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``They did it,'' replied Mrs. Rosenblatt. ``And they did not  
succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in,'' said the judge.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Interview Limits Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's criminal  
investigation is continuing, and he is demanding limits on what 
Monica Lewinsky can say in her first television interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources familiar with negotiations between Starr's office and  
Ms. Lewinsky's legal team said Ms. Lewinsky could be interviewed as 
soon as Saturday by ABC's Barbara Walters. The interview would be 
aired during the February ``sweeps'' period, which ends March 3. 
</P>
<P>
	March 5 is the publication date of ``Monica's Story,'' a  
collaboration between Ms. Lewinsky and Princess Diana biographer 
Andrew Morton. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors and lawyers for the former White House intern were  
still discussing restrictions on the ABC interview Wednesday. A 
number of areas still under investigation are off limits for Ms. 
Lewinsky to discuss, said one of the sources, who would not 
identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	The main restriction is that Ms. Lewinsky cannot go beyond what  
she has said in her numerous published interviews with prosecutors 
and in her grand jury testimony, said the sources. Already on the 
public record are some two dozen interview summaries and testimony 
from her two grand jury appearances and from a sworn deposition at 
Starr's offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky spokeswoman Judy Smith, Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly  
and ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy all declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky needs Starr's permission for the TV interview  
because she agreed to a prohibition against talking to the news 
media in the agreement she signed with the office of the 
independent counsel last July 28. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for promising not to prosecute Ms. Lewinsky, the  
document states that ``pending a final resolution of this matter, 
neither Ms. Lewinsky nor her agents will make any statements about 
this matter to ... representatives of the news media, without first 
obtaining the OIC's approval.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury Starr used to conduct his perjury and obstruction  
of justice probe of President Clinton is meeting twice this week. 
While Starr concluded some time ago that a sitting president is 
indictable, it does not appear that he is gearing up for a case 
against Clinton. One of his deputies has left the office and at 
least one other key prosecutor is preparing to leave, people 
familiar with the prosecutors' plans say. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's testimony conflicts on several points with both  
Clinton and presidential friend Vernon Jordan, who helped line up a 
job offer for her and found her a lawyer when she was subpoenaed as 
a witness against Clinton in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case 
against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky has testified that she tried to make clear to  
Jordan that she had an intimate relationship with the president 
after initially denying having sexual relations with him in 
response to a direct question from Jordan. She also says she 
understood Jordan was telling her to destroy drafts of notes she 
had written the president, but Jordan denies doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	In regard to Clinton, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony conflicts on when  
their intimate relationship started, how many times they engaged in 
such behavior and the details of their encounters. He says he never 
touched her in a sexual manner. She says he did.

<HEADLINE> Prices Jump at Wholesale Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Big cost increases for gasoline, pork and  
citrus fruit in January added up to the largest rise in prices 
charged by factories, refineries and food processing plants in more 
than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department's Producer Price Index began the year by  
jumping 0.5 percent, the most since October 1996, after declining 
0.1 percent for all of 1998 and 1.2 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	However, much of the rise reported today in prices for finished  
goods was concentrated in just a few items and should not draw an 
interest-rate increase from the inflation-wary Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices excluding the volatile food and energy components  
actually fell for the first time in seven months, edging 0.1 
percent lower. And analysts believe inflation in prices paid by 
consumers will remain muted this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices charged by food producers rose 1.6 percent, the most in  
nearly six years, after slipping 0.1 percent during 1998. Energy 
prices jumped 1.8 percent, the most in two years, but had fallen 
12.1 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the department said first-time applications for  
unemployment checks barely budged last week, staying at a level 
signaling healthy demand for labor. 
</P>
<P>
	State unemployment offices received a seasonally adjusted  
288,000 claims for benefits, up from 284,000 the week before. A 
four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes weekly 
fluctuations in the volatile data series, fell from 298,750 to 
292,000, the lowest in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the price of pork shot up 18.3 percent, the largest  
one-month increase in nearly 25 years, after falling 26.9 percent 
over the course of the previous year in response to diminished 
demand in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University  
attributed the rebound, in part, to winter storms, which resulted 
in farmers sending fewer animals to slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh fruits and melons cost 19.6 percent more than the month  
before, the largest increase in 13 months, reflecting a 56.3 
percent rise in citrus fruit and 26.7 percent in strawberries 
following a freeze in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices climbed 6.5 percent, the most in 17 months,  
after plunging 34.1 percent last year, and fuel oil increased 6.4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside food and energy, car prices fell 1.2 percent last month,  
the most in a year and a half, and computer costs declined 4.5 
percent. Tobacco edged 0.2 percent lower after jumping 26.3 percent 
in December as tobacco companies sought to recoup the 
multimillion-dollar cost of settling liability lawsuits brought by 
state attorneys general. 
</P>
<P>
	Cost pressures at early stages of the production process were  
mixed, with prices rising 0.1 percent for intermediate goods and 
2.6 percent for crude goods, pulled up by hog and petroleum costs. 
</P>
<P>
	An example of the three processing stages is wheat for crude,  
flour for intermediate and bread for finished.

<HEADLINE> Maker Recalls Fix-A-Flat Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Pennzoil-Quaker State Co. is voluntarily  
recalling its Fix-A-Flat tire inflator products, saying they might 
cause tires to explode if improperly exposed to extreme heat after 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	The product container includes two warnings on the can against  
welding or applying flame to wheel rims holding tires that have 
been inflated with Fix-A-Flat. But there have been six explosions 
resulting from improper use, killing one person and injuring five, 
company spokesman Greg Panagos said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been named in one lawsuit resulting from the  
explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennzoil-Quaker State is reformulating the product to make it  
non-inflammable, Panagos said. It will be distributed in the next 
few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will withdraw all Fix-A-Flat products from store  
shelves. The company has sold 30 million cans of Fix-A-Flat, Super 
Fix-A-Flat and Big Wheel Fix-A-Flat. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers who have purchased the product are asked to call the  
company at (800) 532-5000 to find out how to exchange their cans 
for the reformulated product. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennzoil-Quaker State also will distribute pamphlets detailing  
acceptable tire repair practices, regardless of whether a tire 
inflator product is used. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall and reformulation will cost the company $25 million,  
Panagos said.

<HEADLINE> 9 Convicted in Research Animal Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Nine southern Oregon residents have been  
convicted in a scheme to obtain dogs through theft or fraud and 
sell them for research in Seattle and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders of the ring, Betty Gayle Davis and her husband,  
Bobby Ray Davis, were sentenced to home confinement Tuesday for 
conspiring to violate the Animal Welfare Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Davis, 49, was placed on six months house arrest and  
ordered to pay restitution to the Brentwood Bio-Medical Research 
Institute in Los Angeles for the cost of returning research 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 50, was sentenced to four months home confinement.  
</P>
<P>
	David F. Dickson, a special agent with the U.S. Department of  
Agriculture, said some of the dogs were stolen, while others were 
obtained through false pretenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The subjects would answer an ad advertising the pet to a good  
home,'' he said. ``They would say, `Yes, we're getting the dogs for 
our son.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven others, including the Davises' son, were convicted of  
stealing dogs. They have yet to be sentenced.

<HEADLINE> Few Residency Rules in Senate Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If Hillary Rodham Clinton is serious about  
running for the U.S. Senate in New York, she'll have to start 
raising money soon. But she won't have to move there before 
Election Day 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, a candidate can run for the Senate in any state without  
moving until the last minute, since the Constitution requires only 
that senators be residents ``when elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She could go anywhere she wants to,'' said Doug Lewis,  
executive director of The Election Center, a nonprofit information 
clearinghouse in Houston. ``Obviously, there has to be an opening, 
or a place where she'd be a viable candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution lists three requirements for senator: a minimum  
age of 30, U.S. citizenship for at least nine years, and that the 
senator, ``when elected, be an inhabitant of that state for which 
he shall be chosen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several states have imposed additional restrictions, but  
election law experts say they are constitutionally suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts, Wyoming and Nebraska, among other states, require  
that a Senate candidate be a registered voter. In Ohio, a Senate 
candidate has to be registered to vote 30 days before the election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think restrictions beyond what's in the Constitution  
would stand up'' if challenged in court, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Jaeger, secretary of state in North Dakota, agreed, citing a  
Supreme Court ruling overturning congressional term limits as a 
guide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are of the opinion that a state can't really go beyond what  
the Constitution says,'' Jaeger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Practically speaking, no candidate would be likely to make a  
Senate run in New York or elsewhere without establishing residency 
at least some months before an election, as Robert F. Kennedy did 
in New York in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, from Massachusetts, campaigned in New York for months  
that year but did not actually live there until he rented an 
apartment in New York City in August. 
</P>
<P>
	He won his Senate seat three months later, establishing the  
precedent that the state is open to outsiders with political star 
power. Republican James Buckley, of Connecticut, did the same thing 
in New York in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she would surely be tagged a carpetbagger shopping for  
a Senate seat, the wife of a sitting president would offer New 
Yorkers a candidate with instant name recognition and proven 
fund-raising abilities, Democratic supporters argue. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll of 502 New York voters by the Marist Institute for Public  
Opinion showed 56 percent thought Mrs. Clinton should run. About 40 
percent said they were not at all concerned that she does not come 
from New York, while about 25 percent said that fact concerned them 
a great deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, taken Feb. 16 and released Thursday, has a margin of  
error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The original carpetbaggers were would-be office holders from the  
North who packed their bags and headed for sunnier political climes 
in the South after the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	Such true outsiders are unusual in modern politics. More typical  
may be Jack McMullen's semioutsider candidacy last year in Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	McMullen, a wealthy Massachusetts Republican, used his Vermont  
vacation home as a home base to seek the GOP Senate nomination 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he lost to a homegrown folk hero, McMullen, like Mrs.  
Clinton, stood on sound constitutional ground, election law experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Home can be where the heart is, in New York or elsewhere,''  
joked Jan Baran, a Washington lawyer specializing in election law. 
``The truth is, it's not that difficult to run for public office in 
the United States.''

<HEADLINE> NAACP Prepares for Annual Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In stark contrast to the recent past, NAACP  
Chairman Julian Bond said the future bears promising financial 
prospects for the nation's oldest civil rights organization as it 
prepares for its 90th annual meeting Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond said corporate giving to the association is up 40 percent  
and foundation gifts are up 50 percent over the past year. Revenues 
from membership are up $2.7 million in the last year, Bond said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have many other good things to talk about Saturday,''  
Bond said. 
</P>
<P>
	Funding has been critical since the National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People teetered on insolvency during the 
mid-1990s. The $3 million debt and internal leadership battles at 
the time hampered the association. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond said the NAACP has organized 34 new college and high school  
chapters, including offshoots at Harvard University and Stanford 
University and has sought to put race relations as a critical issue 
on the nation's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is scheduled to attend the association's  
annual dinner Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is expected to release his report on the White House's  
yearlong campaign for racial reconciliation this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond and NAACP President Kweisi Mfume, who is responsible for  
day-to-day operations, will address delegates and members from the 
group's 2,220 local units Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond will discuss the state of race relations. Other topics to  
be examined at the meeting are protecting affirmative action, 
police brutality and helping ex-felons get their rights to vote 
restored. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were founded in 1909 to fight a rising tide of white  
supremacy,'' Bond said. ``Sadly while legal apartheid had been 
vanquished, our democracy is still stained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the NAACP and the American Cancer Society will  
sponsor a national breast and cervical cancer training workshop in 
Washington designed to help bring attention to the illnesses which 
strike black women at disproportionately high rates. 
</P>
<P>
	To help more blacks buy homes, the NAACP and mortgage lender  
Fannie Mae announced a partnership last month to provide up to $110 
million in financing for families that can't afford big down 
payments.

<HEADLINE> Some Seeking Strong Rockingham Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKINGHAM, N.C. (AP) -- It's going to take a while for a number  
of Winston Cup drivers to forget about this year's Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who did well, like winner Jeff Gordon and runner-up  
Dale Earnhardt, they are delighted to get started on what they hope 
will be a championship season. 
</P>
<P>
	But drivers like Bobby and Terry Labonte, Dale Jarrett and Mark  
Martin need a good day in Sunday's Dura-Lube-Big Kmart 400 at North 
Carolina Speedway to help them forget an unhappy start to the new 
season last Sunday in Daytona. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a frustrating day in the Daytona 500, but there's no  
sense worrying about it,'' said Bobby Labonte, who went into the 
season-opener as one of the favorites and wound up finshing 25th. 
``We need to have a good run in Rockingham to get us back on 
track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His older brother, Terry, was even worse off, finishing 38th.  
Martin and Jarrett, who were second and third behind Gordon in last 
year's title chase, were 31st and 37th in Daytona. 
</P>
<P>
	All of them view this week's race as a chance to get the new  
season jump-started after misfiring in the first race. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Labonte, a two-time series champ, has put together a  
string of five straight top-10 finishes on the 1.017-mile 
Rockingham oval. In 40 career starts here, he has been running at 
the finish 33 times. 
</P>
<P>
	``After two straight weekends at Daytona, I think we're all  
eager to get to Rockingham, if for no other reason than to get back 
into a regular routine of Friday qualifying, Saturday practice and 
race on Sunday,'' Labonte said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's so much pressure on all of us starting the year at  
Daytona, so you might breathe a little sigh of relief at 
Rockingham, although this can be a pretty tough place to get a win, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Labonte's 20 Winston Cup victories have come at  
Rockingham, but none since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``After what happened to us at Daytona, we really need to get  
going this week,'' Labonte said. ``If you're going to compete for 
the championship, you can't have too many days like we had at 
Daytona. You've got to be consistent. Jeff and Martin and Jarrett 
aren't going to wait around for us to get our act together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin got caught up in the same multicar crash that ruined the  
Daytona race for the elder Labonte and Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't spend a lot of time worrying about what happened in  
the last race because we've still got 33 races left to run,'' 
Martin said. ``Sure, I'm disappointed at what happened. It's the 
same kind of thing that happened to us on the restrictor-plate 
tracks (Daytona and Talladega) a couple of times last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you can't spend a lot of time feeling sorry for yourself.  
That was last week. There's too much to do to get ready for the 
next race. We're at Rockingham now, and that's what we have to deal 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, who ignited the big crash last Sunday, was also looking  
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get off to a bad start like that, all you can do is  
try to win the next one and the next one,'' he said. ``We know 
we're capable of winning every week. Now we just have to go out and 
do it.''

<HEADLINE> Mom, Gun-Rights Advocates Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A shouting match between the mother of  
one of the Jonesboro school shooting victims and gun-rights 
advocates ended in taunts and tears on the state Capitol steps. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzann Wilson, whose 11-year-old daughter, Britthney Varner,  
died in the March 24 attack, watched indignantly Wednesday as about 
a dozen people held a news conference criticizing state legislation 
that she supports. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would hold gun owners criminally responsible if  
children use accessible guns to hurt or kill someone. The bill was 
developed in response to the shooting that killed Ms. Wilson's 
daughter, three other students and a teacher at Westside Middle 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Andrew Golden, then 11, and Mitchell Johnson,  
then 13, used guns taken from the home of Andrew's grandfather, 
Doug Golden. The boys were sentenced as delinquents to the state 
Juvenile Justice system. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the victims are suing the boys' families, including  
Doug Golden, and the gun manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said the bill would not have stopped the murders, but  
would infringe people's right to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after the news conference, cameras turned to Ms.  
Wilson and Pam Herring, whose daughter, Paige Ann Herring, also was 
killed in the Jonesboro attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a case about protection. It was a case about a  
grandfather who had a million, trillion guns stored on the wall,'' 
Ms. Wilson said. ``They were stored so the child could break in, 
take them off the wall, take them to school and blow away my 
daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her words attracted several gun-rights advocates, who  
questioned, criticized and taunted her as she continued to talk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got guns, come and get them,'' one man said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a right to protect our own homes,'' proclaimed  
another over the growing noise. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving the area in tears, Ms. Wilson screamed: ``This is  
not about the Second Amendment; this is about parents burying their 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is pending before the state Senate.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Survivor Sues Bayer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- German pharmaceutical giant Bayer AG  
participated in World War II atrocities committed by Nazi doctors 
who experimented on Jews, according to a suit filed by a Holocaust 
survivor. 
</P>
<P>
	Eva Mozes Kor of Terre Haute filed the lawsuit Wednesday in U.S.  
District Court here. With her sister, Ms. Kor was among the 
hundreds of sets of twins experimented on by the infamous Dr. Josef 
Mengele at the Auschwitz concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayer paid Nazi officials for access to those confined in  
concentration camps and collaborated in Nazi experiments as a form 
of research and development, plaintiff's lawyer Irwin B. Levin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's impossible to put on a scale the various horrors of the  
Holocaust, but this case represents the worst example of individual 
and corporate evil that the legal system may ever see,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	She claims that Bayer monitored and supervised the experiments.  
Her lawsuit states that prisoners were injected with germs known to 
cause diseases ``to test the effectiveness of various drugs'' 
manufactured by Bayer. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and the recovery of  
profits it maintains Bayer earned as a result of such research. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, Bayer has denied any involvement in the  
experiments, refused to offer any compensation and refused to 
disclose information, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, Bayer had admitted to using slave labor drafted from  
concentration camps. On Tuesday, Bayer AG was among a dozen German 
companies that said they would participate in a fund to compensate 
individuals who had been used for slave labor. Some experts 
estimate the fund to be about $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Margo Barnes, a spokeswoman for Bayer's U.S. operations, said  
Wednesday that the company had not been notified of the lawsuit and 
had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany, Bayer spokesman Thomas Rienert declined to comment  
on the lawsuit, saying the company had not seen it. However, he 
said similar charges were levied against Bayer's predecessor, I.G. 
Farben, during the Nuremberg trials and that they had been 
``rejected as false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	I.G. Farben, once the world's largest chemical concern, was  
dissolved by the Allies after the war, and its assets were divided 
among the Bayer, Hoechst and BASF chemical companies and other 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kor and her twin sister, Miriam, survived their 10-month  
ordeal at Auschwitz and were liberated by Soviet troops in January 
1945. They were nearly 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Miriam died in 1993 of kidney disease. Her kidneys had never  
grown to adult size due to her treatment at Auschwitz, according to 
the lawsuit.

<HEADLINE>  Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	How was that for a first day of spring training?  
</P>
<P>
	On the day workouts for the 1999 season officially began, two  
stories that will have a profound effect on the two best teams in 
the game shook up baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees completed their winter-long courtship of  
Roger Clemens, acquiring the five-time Cy Young Award winner from 
Toronto for David Wells, Graeme Lloyd and Homer Bush on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just another indication of how the business of baseball  
is these days,'' pitcher Mike Stanton said. ``We won 125 games, but 
you're still always looking to make yourself better. What can you 
say? It's one of those things that happens in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves were dealt a serious blow when doctors  
announced that first baseman Andres Galarraga has a cancerous tumor 
in his back and will miss the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the potential for his recovery is very good with  
successful treatment,'' Dr. Lee Kelley said. ``There's no 
widespread involvement, so the outlook is very good. I think 
there's a good possibility that he can look forward to playing in 
2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, 37, will undergo six months of treatment, which will  
include chemotherapy followed by radiation. He is the fourth 
prominent baseball player since 1996 to be stricken with cancer, 
following Brett Butler, Eric Davis and Darryl Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad that he's out for the season, but it's a relief to  
know the cancer hasn't spread,'' manager Bobby Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Klesko is expected to replace Galarraga, who hit .305 with  
44 homers and 121 RBIs last season. Otis Nixon and Gerald Williams 
are expected to share time in left field in place of Klesko. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our offense will be potent, but obviously not as potent  
without Andres,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, coming off consecutive Cy Youngs, will report to the  
Yankees on Saturday. He went 20-6 last season, leading the AL in 
ERA (2.65) and strikeouts (271), and tying for the lead in wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a group of warriors here and we're getting a very  
big warrior,'' owner George Steinbrenner said. ``He's a monster. 
He's just, `Give me the ball' -- a real competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who was also sought by Texas, Cleveland and Houston,  
has always been one of Steinbrenner's favorite players, and is the 
only five-time Cy Young winner in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met my match in a guy who wants to win,'' Clemens said after  
speaking with The Boss. ``This guy, he settles for nothing less. I 
enjoy that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto had wanted several young prospects from teams when it  
shopped Clemens in December, but the Yankees were able to hold onto 
some of the players the Blue Jays coveted most: outfielder Ricky 
Ledee and pitcher Ramiro Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, a quirky left-hander known as ``Boomer,'' was the toast  
of New York after pitching a perfect game against the Minnesota 
Twins on May 17. He was one of the team's most effective pitchers 
with an 18-4 record and a 3.49 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd, a 31-year-old left-hander from Australia, was 3-0 with a  
1.67 ERA in 50 relief appearances last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, a 26-year-old who plays primarily at second base, hit .380  
in 71 at-bats for the Yankees, but was considered expendable 
because New York has Chuck Knoblauch. 
</P>
<P>
	In other baseball news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Mariano Rivera made it 2-0 for Yankees players in salary  
arbitration when he was awarded $4.25 million rather than the 
team's $3 million offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners are 6-2 in arbitration this year, losing only to Rivera  
and to Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, who will get $5 million this 
year instead of the team's $3.2 million offer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cleveland shortstop Omar Vizquel abandoned the idea of staying  
away from spring training to prod the Indians to improve his $21 
million, seven-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's safe to say that I'll be there on time,'' said Vizquel,  
who is expected to report Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Randy Johnson said he's much more at ease in his first spring  
training with Arizona than he was the last two years with Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, he was coming off back surgery and was dealing with all  
the doubts about whether he would return to his old intimidating 
form. Last year, he was in a sour mood after the Mariners' decided 
against extending his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is probably going to be one of my better spring  
trainings,'' Johnson said after his first workout with the 
Diamondbacks. ``Last year, I had to deal with a lot of contract 
stuff and I'm really glad it's over and behind me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Right-hander Ben McDonald, sidelined nearly two years because  
of shoulder problems, agreed to a minor league contract with Tampa 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays also learned outfielder Quinton McCracken has a  
sprained right knee that will sideline him 4-6 weeks.

<HEADLINE>  Mexico Soccer Star's Dad Kidnapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) -- Kidnappers have terrorized shopkeepers,  
farmers, bankers and entertainers. Now, a gang of men brandishing 
Kalashnikovs has the father of flamboyant soccer idol Jorge Campos. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite recent arrests, kidnappings for ransom have remained one  
of Mexico's most feared crimes. They have been blamed on common 
criminals, guerrilla bands and even police -- one reason victims' 
families often fear seeking help. 
</P>
<P>
	The kidnapping of Alvaro Campos has angered many in Mexico,  
where his son is one of the country's most famous figures. Mexico's 
star goalkeeper in the 1994 and 1998 World Cup tournaments, Campos 
is known for his flashy uniforms, which he used to design himself, 
and for his talents as goalkeeper and forward. 
</P>
<P>
	He flew home to Mexico on Thursday from Hong Kong, where he had  
been in a tournament with Mexico's national soccer team. ``I insist 
that the main thing in this case is that they respect the life of 
my father,'' he was quoted Thursday as telling the sports daily 
Ovaciones. 
</P>
<P>
	Campos has a contract with Major League Soccer to play for the  
Chicago Fire, but the team let him return to Mexico for the season 
to compete with a top division team, UNAM Pumas. The Fire, which 
acquired him from the Los Angeles Galaxy a year ago, expect him 
back in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our thoughts and concerns are with Jorge and his family. We're  
very upset to hear about what happened, and we hope Alvaro is 
returned safely,'' Chicago Fire spokesman Adam Low said. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as eight armed men seized Alvaro Campos, known to  
friends as ``El Nono,'' or ``The Grandpa,'' shortly before 2 p.m. 
Wednesday at a sports field named for his son in a southern suburb 
of Acapulco, near the city airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``El Nono told all of us, his family and his friends, that he  
had received some phone calls since December in which they 
threatened to kidnap him, but he said those were jokes,'' said 
Ricardo Jimenez Anaya, a friend of Alvaro Campos. 
</P>
<P>
	Local residents said Alvaro Campos, 65, is well-liked and known  
for helping to promote local soccer. He also had recorded 
television commercials for the governing Institutional 
Revolutionary Party before this month's state election. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Acapulco said they couldn't comment on the case until  
the family filed a complaint. Acapulco, one of Mexico's most famed 
beach resorts, is a part of Guerrero state, which has been plagued 
by abductions. 
</P>
<P>
	New York native Vincent Carroza, manager of Acapulco's Princess  
Hotel, was held for eight days in December 1997. Businessman 
Melchor Perusquia was found murdered in March 1996 after his family 
paid a ransom reported at $390,000. Vicente Fernandez, a 
ranchero-style singer, had to pay a reported $3.2 million in 
September to win the release of a son, whose two fingers were cut 
off by kidnappers during a four-month captivity in northern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's most-wanted kidnapper, Daniel Arizmendi, known for  
cutting off victims' ears, was captured in August. But kidnappings 
have not abated. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico City, where officials last year reported an average of  
a kidnapping a day, news of the Campos kidnapping angered some, but 
surprised few of those reading the headlines at a newsstand. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should have the death penalty here. There is too much  
impunity,'' said Ruth Felder, a 69-year old retired German woman 
who has lived in Mexico 37 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Businessman Hector Garcia, 40, said, ``it's just another  
kidnapping, but it happens to involve somebody famous. There are 
lots of kidnappings every day, but nobody seems to care anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Brooks Is First at Padres Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Garth Brooks was the first player at  
practice Thursday as the San Diego Padres began formal spring 
training workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody ever wanted to be better,'' the country music  
star/outfielder said as about 50 fans crowded outside the complex 
for his autograph. ``My want is so much greater than my talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, 37, insists his goal is not to embarrass major league  
baseball, but to pursue his boyhood dream and raise money for 
children's charities. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Trevor Hoffman, Wally Joyner and Tony Gwynn have all  
been pretty helpful so far.

	``These guys are telling me to lighten up,'' Brooks said. ``They  
say: 'It's only spring training, save some for the season.' What 
they don't understand is, this is my season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks doesn't expect to play with the Padres, but he hopes to  
make a farm team. 
</P>
<P>
	``My biggest contribution to this team is to remind everyone of  
how lucky they are,'' Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	As pitchers and catchers reported, Randy Myers was missing. The  
Padres are attempting to trade the left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego, the defending National League champion, returns this  
season without five major contributors from last year's team: Kevin 
Brown, Greg Vaughn, Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley and Joey Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	The burden falls on center fielder Ruben Rivera, third baseman  
George Arias, rookie pitcher Matt Clement, and outfielder Reggie 
Sanders, acquisition from Cincinnati in the Vaughn deal earlier 
this month.

<HEADLINE> Border Patrol Agents Rare in NCalif </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Calif. (AP) -- Tom Madden, a 20-year veteran of the U.S.  
Border Patrol, used to spend his time chasing tips and visiting 
construction sites and bus terminals to round up illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, except for a secretary, Madden sits at his desk, surrounded  
by empty cubicles and typewriters hidden by dusty black covers. 
With the agency focusing its attention elsewhere, Border Patrol 
agents have become a rarity in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the agents here, we're totally reactive,'' said  
Madden, who has his hands full just doing paperwork and shuttling 
prisoners from the local jail. ``We have no proactive enforcement 
at all here. It's very difficult to work with just one person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Madden works virtually alone largely because of Operation  
Gatekeeper, an initiative launched more than four years ago to stop 
the flow of illegal immigrants in the San Diego region. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, only 24 agents -- down from 65 a few years ago -- cover  
nearly all of California north of Los Angeles. San Diego has about 
2,200 agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Madden is responsible for a 300-mile stretch of coast as well as  
inland areas from Oregon to the booming suburbs east of the San 
Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not able to do as much for the public as I would like to  
do because of the limited manpower. Lack of manpower, actually,'' 
said Madden, whose last colleague from what was once a five-agent 
patrol transferred last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of agents in the interior has drawn criticism from Rep.  
Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., and other congressmen who believe the 
Clinton administration should have sought funding for 1,000 more 
Border Patrol officers next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last month, police in the Bay area suburb of Dublin pulled  
over a van that had run a stop sign. Inside were 12 illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	If the van had been traveling in San Diego, Tucson, Ariz., or  
anywhere along the U.S.-Mexican border, deportation would have been 
automatic. But it was a Saturday, Madden's day off. With no 24-hour 
detention cell for illegals in northern California, police had no 
choice but to free the immigrants. It happens a lot, Madden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of California's estimated 2 million illegal immigrants, as many  
as 400,000 lived in northern California in 1997, according to 
projections by San Diego economist Enrico Marcelli of the Center 
for U.S.-Mexican Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 626 illegal immigrants deported last year in Madden's  
nine-county coverage area -- nearly 40 percent less than in 1994. 
Asked to explain the drop, Madden simply said: ``No people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and other agents once traveled regularly to farms across  
northern parts of the state, but Madden has hasn't been there in 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Gatekeeper, San Diego was the premier crossing point for  
illegal immigrants, accounting for nearly half of the Border 
Patrols's arrests nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatekeeper's goal was to push the immigration traffic east to  
more dangerous routes that migrants were less likely to try. 
However, they weren't dissuaded. The flow exploded in Imperial 
County, about 120 miles east of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	During the last fiscal year, San Diego agents made 248,090  
arrests, down 13 percent from the previous year. But Imperial 
County agents made 226,703 arrests, a 55 percent increase from the 
year before. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, arrests of illegal immigrants along California's  
150-mile border with Mexico dropped to 474,672 last year, compared 
to 477,807 in 1994, government figures show. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the government announced that 1,000 new Border  
Patrol agents will be deployed, mostly in the Southwest, to beef up 
enforcement in Arizona and Texas and to break up smuggling rings 
that moved to Imperial County after the San Diego crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service, which oversees the  
Border Patrol, said the deployment issue is complicated and won't 
be fully resolved until the agency's reorganization is approved by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we've seen attrition in northern California, we have had  
a huge infusion of new agents along the southern border,'' said INS 
spokeswoman Virginia Kice. ``If we can deter people from entering 
the border, they won't end up in northern California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, about 160 special INS agents throughout northern  
California compensate for the lack of Border Patrol presence, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS has tried to compensate in other ways -- leading seminars  
to teach business owners how to spot illegal green cards, for 
example. There's also a pilot project that allows employers to 
verify the status of workers through an Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bilbray said INS efforts must be spread throughout the  
country's interior, not just at the border. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to have the law enforced everywhere,'' the  
congressman said. ``That means just as much in Sacramento as in San 
Diego. We need to strengthen our enforcement, not cannibalize it.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Gives Pilots' Union More Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge has extended his order requiring  
American Airlines' pilot union to encourage its members to show up 
for work. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall said yesterday he would extend  
from March 8 to May 12 his temporary restraining order to the 
Allied Pilots Association. 
</P>
<P>
	For 10 days this month, thousands of pilots, frustrated with  
contract talks, called in sick. The results were delays for more 
than 600,000 passengers and cancellations of about 6,600 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge yesterday also delayed for more than six weeks his  
decision on how to punish the union for originally ignoring his 
order to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to cool down and take the loaded guns away from each  
other's heads,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	The APA asked Kendall to allow it extra time to examine  
American's claim of $58.7 million in damages suffered when 
thousands of flights were grounded from 4 p.m. last Wednesday until 
late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, American estimates that the job action cost it more  
than $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall had ordered the pilots back into their cockpits last  
Wednesday. On Saturday, he held the union and two top board members 
in contempt and said he would fine them. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall continued the damages hearing until April 12.  
</P>
<P>
	The sickout began Feb. 6 after American pilots lost patience  
with Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp., parent company of the 
airline. According to the APA, the company had ignored their 
contract by purchasing Reno Air Corp. and not immediately 
increasing pay for all pilots affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations continued on the issue Wednesday, but the sticking  
point remained that the union wants pilots to be paid retroactively 
to Dec. 23, the date of the airline purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has said it proposed to immediately increase pay up  
to 56 percent for pilots of Reno Air, which was purchased by AMR in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots' pay is half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot is paid.

<HEADLINE> IRS: Electronic Returns Are Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of tax returns filed electronically  
and the amount of the average refund are both up compared with last 
year, the Internal Revenue Service says. 
</P>
<P>
	Through last Friday, IRS had received 13.3 million electronic  
returns, an 11 percent increase over the same period last year. The 
number of self-prepared tax returns filed electronically soared 
from 218,000 during the period last year to 624,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Total returns filed so far have topped 23.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	``More than half of the early filers have e-filed by computer or  
by phone,'' IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said Thursday. 
``These taxpayers appreciate the comfort of having more accurate 
returns and faster refunds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The average refund so far is $1,823, up 14 percent from last  
year. And 9.4 million returns asked for direct deposit of the 
money, an 18.7 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS officials say the new child and education tax credits --  
which reduce taxes on a dollar-for-dollar basis -- are the main 
reason for the higher refunds.

<HEADLINE>  Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	How was that for a first day of spring training?  
</P>
<P>
	On the day workouts for the 1999 season officially began, two  
stories that will have a profound effect on the two best teams in 
the game shook up baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees completed their winter-long courtship of  
Roger Clemens, acquiring the five-time Cy Young Award winner from 
Toronto for David Wells, Graeme Lloyd and Homer Bush on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just another indication of how the business of baseball  
is these days,'' pitcher Mike Stanton said. ``We won 125 games, but 
you're still always looking to make yourself better. What can you 
say? It's one of those things that happens in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves were dealt a serious blow when doctors  
announced that first baseman Andres Galarraga has a cancerous tumor 
in his back and will miss the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the potential for his recovery is very good with  
successful treatment,'' Dr. Lee Kelley said. ``There's no 
widespread involvement, so the outlook is very good. I think 
there's a good possibility that he can look forward to playing in 
2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, 37, will undergo six months of treatment, which will  
include chemotherapy followed by radiation. He is the fourth 
prominent baseball player since 1996 to be stricken with cancer, 
following Brett Butler, Eric Davis and Darryl Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad that he's out for the season, but it's a relief to  
know the cancer hasn't spread,'' manager Bobby Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Klesko is expected to replace Galarraga, who hit .305 with  
44 homers and 121 RBIs last season. Otis Nixon and Gerald Williams 
are expected to share time in left field in place of Klesko. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our offense will be potent, but obviously not as potent  
without Andres,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, coming off consecutive Cy Youngs, will report to the  
Yankees on Saturday. He went 20-6 last season, leading the AL in 
ERA (2.65) and strikeouts (271), and tying for the lead in wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a group of warriors here and we're getting a very  
big warrior,'' owner George Steinbrenner said. ``He's a monster. 
He's just, `Give me the ball' -- a real competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who was also sought by Texas, Cleveland and Houston,  
has always been one of Steinbrenner's favorite players, and is the 
only five-time Cy Young winner in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met my match in a guy who wants to win,'' Clemens said after  
speaking with The Boss. ``This guy, he settles for nothing less. I 
enjoy that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto had wanted several young prospects from teams when it  
shopped Clemens in December, but the Yankees were able to hold onto 
some of the players the Blue Jays coveted most: outfielder Ricky 
Ledee and pitcher Ramiro Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, a quirky left-hander known as ``Boomer,'' was the toast  
of New York after pitching a perfect game against the Minnesota 
Twins on May 17. He was one of the team's most effective pitchers 
with an 18-4 record and a 3.49 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd, a 31-year-old left-hander from Australia, was 3-0 with a  
1.67 ERA in 50 relief appearances last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, a 26-year-old who plays primarily at second base, hit .380  
in 71 at-bats for the Yankees, but was considered expendable 
because New York has Chuck Knoblauch. 
</P>
<P>
	In other baseball news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Mariano Rivera made it 2-0 for Yankees players in salary  
arbitration when he was awarded $4.25 million rather than the 
team's $3 million offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners are 6-2 in arbitration this year, losing only to Rivera  
and to Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, who will get $5 million this 
year instead of the team's $3.2 million offer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cleveland shortstop Omar Vizquel abandoned the idea of staying  
away from spring training to prod the Indians to improve his $21 
million, seven-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's safe to say that I'll be there on time,'' said Vizquel,  
who is expected to report Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Randy Johnson said he's much more at ease in his first spring  
training with Arizona than he was the last two years with Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, he was coming off back surgery and was dealing with all  
the doubts about whether he would return to his old intimidating 
form. Last year, he was in a sour mood after the Mariners' decided 
against extending his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is probably going to be one of my better spring  
trainings,'' Johnson said after his first workout with the 
Diamondbacks. ``Last year, I had to deal with a lot of contract 
stuff and I'm really glad it's over and behind me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Right-hander Ben McDonald, sidelined nearly two years because  
of shoulder problems, agreed to a minor league contract with Tampa 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays also learned outfielder Quinton McCracken has a  
sprained right knee that will sideline him 4-6 weeks.
