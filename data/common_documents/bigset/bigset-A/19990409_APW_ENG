<HEADLINE> Europe Oil Cos. To Gain in Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The United Nations decision to end economic  
sanctions against Libya will give the country's underdeveloped oil 
industry access to the spare parts and money needed to expand 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	That should also be a boon to foreign oil companies that do  
business in Libya, but American companies will be left at a 
competitive disadvantage because sanctions imposed by the U.S. 
government remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations on Monday suspended its seven-year  
restrictions on trade with Libya, ending a ban on international 
flights there. The world body acted after Libya handed over two 
citizens suspected of blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, 
Scotland, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see a great future in Libya, and certainly the lifting of  
sanctions will make life a whole lot easier,'' said Andrew Harber, 
a manager in Britain for the Swedish company Lundin Oil AB. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.N. action is unlikely to unleash a fresh wave of  
European oil companies into Libya, analysts say, because most firms 
with an interest in the country are already operating there. For 
them, U.N. sanctions were more of an inconvenience than a real 
impediment. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, new, direct flights to the Libyan capital will save time  
for visiting managers and drilling crews, who previously had to 
drive to Tripoli from the neighboring country of Tunisia, a 
five-hour journey. Only two days after the sanctions were lifted, 
British Airways announced it would start flying three flights a 
week from London to Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
	The new relations will also likely mean faster international  
money transfers that should help companies complete their projects 
more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	With proven reserves of 30 billion barrels, Libya has as much  
oil as Norway and Britain combined. Its reserves are smaller than 
Mexico's 50 billion barrels, but larger than those of fellow OPEC 
members Nigeria and Indonesia. And its low-sulfur crude fetches a 
premium on global markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Libya also has natural gas reserves of 45.9 trillion cubic feet,  
comparable to those of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Libyans have managed to keep up steady levels of crude  
production despite U.N. and U.S. sanctions, pumping 1.39 million 
barrels a day last year, according to the International Energy 
Agency. Promising areas of the country remain to be explored. 
Lundin, the Swedish firm, is prospecting at En Naga in the Sahara, 
620 miles southeast of Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Conoco Inc. first struck oil in Libya in 1955.  
Since withdrawing from Libya 13 years ago, Conoco has had to forgo 
the production and sale of 300 million barrels of oil worth $5 
billion, company spokesman Carlton Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
	European energy companies such as Italy's ENI, Repsol of Spain  
and Austria's OMV helped fill the void created by the American 
exodus. 
</P>
<P>
	The competitive position of U.S. companies will erode further if  
non-U.S. firms are the only ones allowed to do business in Libya, 
Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one likes to sit on their hands while their competitors are  
out there looking for oil. Libya is a proven producer, it has a lot 
of reserves and it's close to European markets,'' said Peter Bogin 
of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a Paris-based consulting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	For Libya's oil industry, sanctions have hurt most by blocking  
imports of certain types of equipment. The U.S. embargo continues 
to deny Libya access to specific technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanctions also have stifled investment. Since 1996, the U.S.  
Iran-Libya Sanctions Act has barred foreign firms from making new 
investments of $40 million or more -- a ceiling that European 
companies seem to be respecting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a difficult environment in which to operate, but  
certainly not an impossible one,'' said Bogin, of the Paris 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Libya's production capacity will expand slowly, but in the long  
run, analysts say, the improvements may embolden it to pump more 
oil than its OPEC production limits allow. 
</P>
<P>
	Libyan diplomats in London refused to comment when asked about  
this possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center for Global Energy  
Studies in London, said Libya already has one of the worst records 
of compliance with OPEC production limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Libya is one of those countries that pay lip service to an  
agreement but then don't comply fully,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Co. Unveils Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Brown &AMP; Williamson touts its new Web site  
that discusses smoking-related health risks as a sign of solid 
corporate citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco critics call it a smokescreen designed to shield the  
nation's third-largest tobacco company from future liability 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site that debuted this week offers advice to kick the  
cigarette habit and includes the strongest language ever from the 
maker of Kool and Lucky Strike cigarettes about the health risks 
associated with smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize that we're in a controversial industry,'' B&AMP;W  
spokesman Mark Smith said Friday. ``The launch of our new Web site 
is an attempt to demonstrate that we are a responsible company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The venture into cyberspace continues the tobacco industry's  
mantra that smoking is a personal choice, but it also emphasizes 
the health issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brown &AMP; Williamson believes that people who choose to smoke  
are taking significant health risks,'' says the Web site for the 
Louisville-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Epidemiological studies of cigarette smoking and various  
diseases show that groups of smokers have a significantly increased 
incidence of those diseases compared to nonsmokers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco foes said the site offers a carefully tailored viewpoint  
that doesn't offer a comprehensive look at smoking and its 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another attempt by a tobacco company to literally pull  
the wool over the eyes of the public and not tell the whole truth 
about their industry,'' said Ahron Leichtman, executive director of 
Citizens For a Tobacco-Free Society. 
</P>
<P>
	John Garrison, chief executive of the American Lung Association,  
said the Web site was a ``cruel hoax'' that seemed to be drafted by 
Brown &AMP; Williamson's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very clever defensive maneuver to try to make  
themselves less liable as future lawsuits arrive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The site offers a long list of ingredients in cigarettes,  
excluding the proprietary flavoring ingredients, and says it's 
appropriate for health authorities to warn that smoking is 
addictive. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Kuntz, an American Lung Association official in Kentucky, a  
state that grows more burley tobacco than any other, chastised 
Brown &AMP; Williamson for stopping short of calling nicotine 
addictive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same old worn-out dialogue, such as calling smoking  
an adult pleasure and comparing it to normal behavior like drinking 
coffee,'' he said. ``Caffeine is a drug, but it doesn't kill half a 
million Americans a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, said  
the site reflects the tobacco industry's conciliatory tone. 
</P>
<P>
	``This continues the sea change among the companies to the  
current realities of the risks of smoking,'' he said. 
</P>

	``Due to the stronger controls in our country and abroad on  
Colombians, it's easier for a foreigner to evade the authorities,'' 
Colombian secret police chief Col. German Jaramillo said at the end

reported that 40 percent of the heroin and cocaine couriers 
captured in Colombia are foreigners. The majority come from Costa 
Rica, Spain and several African countries, he said.

<P>
	The trend was confirmed by other attendees at the gathering of  
officials from 30 drug-consuming and -producing countries, 
including the United States.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Fails To Free U.S. Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO hoped a visit by a former  
Cypriot president would result in freedom for three captured U.S. 
soldiers, but Yugoslav authorities had their own agenda: getting 
their side of the story out. 
</P>
<P>
	Cypriot mediator Spyros Kyprianou held a fruitless 90-minute  
meeting today with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, a day 
after arriving on what he described as a humanitarian mission to 
bring the U.S. soldiers out. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, he acknowledged his mission had failed and blamed  
``intensified heavy bombing'' by NATO forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is well known and it has always been the position of  
President Milosevic, that bombing should stop,'' Kyprianou said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has demanded the unconditional release of the  
three servicemen-- Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; 
Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.; and 
Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyprianou, the speaker of the Cyprus parliament, got a firsthand  
look at the devastation in Yugoslavia before heading into talks 
with Milosevic at the presidential palace. After a red-carpet 
welcome Thursday night, he spent most of Friday touring civilian 
areas the government said were hit by NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic and a  
contingent of reporters, Kyprianou went to Cuprija, which 
Yugoslavia said was hit by a dozen airstrikes on Thursday, and 
Aleksinac, where 13 people died when a NATO strike went awry 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cuprija, a town of about 22,000 people 75 miles southeast of  
Belgrade, Jovanovic pointed to a cherry orchard full of broken, 
flattened trees and told Kyprianou: ``They can stop the cherry 
trees blossoming, but they can't stop us defending our country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A NATO spokesman could not confirm whether the alliance had  
carried out airstrikes in or near Cuprija, but said NATO does its 
utmost to avoid so-called ``collateral damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO did acknowledge the strike on Aleksinac, 100 miles south of  
Belgrade, saying it was caused by a technical error. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cuprija, scores of buildings were destroyed -- three-story  
red-roofed cottages and sturdier concrete apartments. Three schools 
and a large indoor sports arena also were damaged by what Jovanovic 
said were 12 bombs dropped in eight minutes by NATO planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Radovan Stefanovic told Kyprianou that his was one of the dozens  
of homes destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only God saved us,'' Stefanovic said, adding that he, his wife  
and three children had taken shelter in the basement of his house. 
</P>
<P>
	In Aleksinac, Mayor Slobodan Stepanovic asked Kyprianou: ``Don't  
they realize what they are doing to innocent civilians?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Have courage,'' Kyprianou told him.  
</P>
<P>
	After his tour, Kyprianou told reporters ``renewed bombing last  
night has made the situation worse,'' in terms of hopes for the 
soldiers' release. 
</P>
<P>
	He expressed some irritation over Western media reports that he  
was being used as a propaganda tool, saying it was normal that the 
Yugoslavs would want their point of view conveyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyprus and Yugoslavia have had close ties since the heyday of  
the Non-Aligned Movement in the 1960s and '70s. The Serbs who 
dominate Yugoslavia and the Greek Cypriots are both Orthodox 
Christians. Kosovo's ethnic Albanians are Muslim, like the Turks 
whom Greek Cypriots have historically hated.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Picks European Tariff Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lovers of Scottish cashmere sweaters can  
rejoice. But Americans with a hankering for French handbags weren't 
so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States published its final hit list Friday of  
European products that will be subject to 100 percent tariffs 
designed to eliminate those goods from American store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	The retaliation list is part of a nasty trade fight between the  
United States and the 15-nation European Union over bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration said French handbags still will be  
targeted as part of a total sanction list of $191.4 million in 
European products. But a number of goods were removed from a 
much-larger initial list that had covered $520 million in European 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to cashmere sweaters, other items removed from the  
original target list were cookies from Britain, European pork 
products, Italian pecorino cheese and candles. 
</P>
<P>
	Decisions on what to include and exclude were based on a need to  
trim the sanctions amount to confirm with a ruling this week by the 
World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	A WTO arbitration panel ruled that America's higher claim of  
$520 million in harm being done to U.S. banana companies was 
excessive and put the actual amount of lost sales annually at the 
$191.4 million figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Since March 3, the administration has been requiring importers  
to post bonds that would cover 100 percent tariffs on the larger 
target list, but officials said all along that they would refund 
any amounts that were not allowed by the WTO panel. 
</P>
<P>
	European officials have complained that mere publication of the  
list had a chilling effect on the their companies' ability to sell 
into the U.S. market. American importers started canceling orders 
in the fear that they could be stuck with goods that could not be 
sold because the threatened 100 percent tariffs had doubled their 
prices in the American market. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision on what goods to include and exclude was made on  
the basis of the need to reduce the total damage amount and also 
represented an attempt to equalize the economic pain among targeted 
countries, U.S. officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to handbags, other consumer items still on the  
target list include coffee makers and tea pots, except those made 
in Italy; lithographs printed not more than 20 years ago; bed 
linens; bath preparations; and electric batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to these items, the list included cardboard packing  
cartons and uncoated felt paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Helaine Klaskey, a spokeswoman for U.S. Trade Representative  
Charlene Barshefsky, said the decision was made to exclude coffee 
makers from Italy because that country already had a number of 
items on the hit list. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the 15 EU nations, Denmark and the Netherlands, always  
have been excluded from the target list because they have urged the 
EU to agree to U.S. demands in the banana fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The $191.4 million in targeted products equals the amount the  
WTO set as the level of lost sales by two American banana 
companies, Chiquita and Dole, because of European banana import 
restrictions that the WTO has ruled violate global trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
	EU spokeswoman Ella Krucoff said European officials are weighing  
the possibility of appealing the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The banana fight is one of two trade disputes in which the  
United States is threatening to impose punitive tariffs against 
Europe. The other involves a European ban on American beef 
containing growth hormones.

<HEADLINE> Rifle Found Near Dead Doctor's Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMHERST, N.Y. (AP) -- A rifle found near the home of a slain  
abortion doctor may yield important clues for investigators trying 
to track down the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Barnett Slepian was killed in his kitchen by a sniper's  
bullet last fall. Investigators said Friday they found a rifle 
buried near his home in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun was sent to the FBI laboratory in Washington to  
determine whether it was used to kill Slepian. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's not too badly rusted, they may be able to match the  
bullet back to the weapon,'' said Walter Rowe, forensics sciences 
professor at George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	The rifle might also have clothing fibers, fingerprints or a  
serial number that can be traced to the buyer, Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buried a foot beneath the ground, the weapon was unearthed  
during a search of a heavily wooded, four-acre area Thursday. 
Investigators did not say how close the weapon was to the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-abortion protester James Kopp is being sought as a material  
witness in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Kopp's car was seen in the neighborhood in  
the days before the slaying. Kopp vanished after the shooting, and 
the car was found abandoned at the Newark, N.J., airport in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said DNA test results showed a likelihood that a  
strand of hair discovered behind Slepian's home came from Kopp.

<HEADLINE> Key to Miller Disappearance on Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A military logbook that sheds light on the  
mysterious disappearance of American bandleader Glenn Miller during 
World War II will be up for auction next week, offering a chance to 
own a clue to one of aviation's most captivating puzzles. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who created the 1940s big band sound, was en route to  
France to organize concerts for Allied troops when his plane 
disappeared over the English Channel on a foggy December day in 
1944. 
</P>
<P>
	No trace has ever been found of the single-engine aircraft or  
its passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad weather was the chief suspect until the flight log was  
produced, which suggests a more haunting -- and now largely accepted 
-- theory: Miller's plane may have been blasted out of the sky by 
bombs jettisoned by a Royal Air Force squadron returning from an 
aborted raid on Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many theories ... and we'll never know for sure what  
happened. But this is certainly an intriguing possibility,'' said 
Stephen Maycock, an aeronautical specialist with Sotheby's, which 
is auctioning the logbook Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, which belonged to the late Royal Air Force navigator  
Fred Shaw, will be sold along with a letter from Britain's Ministry 
of Defense bolstering the theory and a bundle of newspaper 
clippings and other materials. 
</P>
<P>
	The items are expected to fetch $960 to $1,300.  
</P>
<P>
	``Glenn Miller is an extremely important character and this is a  
fascinating story that has captured people's imaginations,'' said 
Rachel Aked, a Sotheby's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The trombonist's fans have spent decades trying to determine  
what happened to him on Dec. 15, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until the mid-1980s that Shaw dug out his logbook  
after going to see the film ``The Glenn Miller Story,'' which 
chronicles the life of the man who wrote such songs as ``In the 
Mood'' and ``Moonlight Serenade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a single entry -- ``Ops. Siegen Canceled. Jettison Southern  
Area'' -- the logbook confirmed what Shaw suspected: Miller's plane 
disappeared on the same day Shaw's squadron aborted a bombing raid 
on Siegen, Germany, and let loose their 4,000-pound bombs over the 
English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombs, which had to be discarded before the bombers could  
safely land, exploded just above the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw remembered seeing a small plane spiraling out of control  
after the bombs were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``Around it, I could see the sea bubbling and blistering with  
the exploding bombs. As each bomb burst, I could see the blast wave 
from it radiating outwards. ... It was obvious to me that airplane 
below was in trouble,'' he once said. ``Eventually, I saw it 
disappear into the English Channel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The downed plane was not reported, but Shaw's story was  
corroborated by other squadron members. And in 1985, Britain's 
Ministry of Defense wrote a letter to Shaw conceding his theory 
``is certainly possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In retrospect, we now lean towards this being the most likely  
solution to the 'mystery,'' the department concluded.

<HEADLINE> Drug Maker Settles Fen-Phen Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The first trial over heart-valve damage from  
fen-phen has ended in a reported $500,000 settlement for a woman 
who used the diet drug combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement came a week into Sandra Moore's case against the  
pharmaceutical giant American Home Products Corp. The 52-year-old 
former teacher had sought $110 million. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home said today it had agreed to a settlement but  
offered no details. The Dallas Morning News, citing unidentified 
sources, reported that the company will pay $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors found mild heart valve damage in Ms. Moore after she  
took fen-phen to promote weight loss, and she is on medication for 
her condition. She claimed American Home knew heart problems could 
result but hid them to maximize profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Michael McGartland, did not return calls seeking  
comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home argued that Ms. Moore has a mild and common  
disorder often called a heart murmur that could be hereditary. The 
company said it acted responsibly in marketing and monitoring its 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home, through its Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories subsidiary,  
marketed fenfluramine -- half of the fen-phen combination -- and 
Redux, a similar product. 
</P>
<P>
	The Madison, N.J.-based drug maker pulled fenfluramine and Redux  
off the market in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's 
request. A Mayo Clinic study had linked the drugs to potentially 
fatal heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug maker has since been hit with hundreds of lawsuits.  
</P>
<P>
	The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated  
with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moore's lawsuit, the first of its kind to go to a jury, was  
being closely followed by others with similar claims against the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas lawyer Kip Petroff, who has 100 fen-cases, said the  
settlement could encourage more lawsuits, even from people who 
didn't suffer major medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a mild case is worth however much they got, I think there  
are lawyers who are going to be encouraged to pursue such cases,'' 
Petroff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell Keith, a Fort Worth lawyer who said he has rejected  
several fen-phen cases, said he disagreed because such cases are 
expensive to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
	``To sue for $110 million and then a week later take half a  
million dollars is not what I call a victory; I call that a loss,'' 
he said. ``I believe it'll have a chilling effect on people with 
minor to modest damages.''

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Zimmer Becomes the Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fifty-one years in baseball has made Don Zimmer  
one of the game's great storytellers. One month as New York Yankees 
interim manager has made him the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you guys said nine words to me in three years  
being a bench coach and I loved every minute of it,'' Zimmer said 
Friday before the Yankees beat the Detroit Tigers 12-3 in their 
home opener. ``This is something I just hope I don't screw up. I 
can't wait for Joe to get back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until Joe Torre returns from prostate cancer surgery, Zimmer's  
first priority will be keeping the best team in baseball on track, 
not being the Yankees' Yoda, imparting wisdom and tales. 
</P>
<P>
	And he has an ample supply of both. That's to be expected from a  
man who played briefly for the team that lost the most games in 
baseball history -- the 1962 New York Mets -- and was bench coach for 
last year's Yankees team that won the most games ever. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Torre is gone, don't expect Zimmer to try to imitate  
his friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did that the first two weeks and that was the end of that,''  
said Zimmer, whose record is now 3-1. ``I have to be myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Cone, who started Friday's home opener, has seen the  
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he is more comfortable,'' Cone said. ``The only way  
you can do that is to win some games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If not for Torre, who asked Zimmer to join him in New York  
before the 1996 season, Zimmer would be back in Florida with his 
wife Jean, spending his time at the movies and the race track. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead he is running the World Series champions, talking  
baseball and enjoying every minute of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who doesn't get a special feeling on opening day,  
especially if you are in a uniform, something is wrong,'' said 
Zimmer, who last managed at Yankee Stadium on July 23, 1982, less 
than one week before he was fired by Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, in fact, was supposed to manage the opener at Yankee  
Stadium that year too, but a snow storm wiped out the entire 
series. He was here for the opener the year before, when his 
Rangers lost to the Yankees 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's different being in pinstripes on this kind of day.  
</P>
<P>
	``Coming off the year we had, to walk out today in front of  
50,000 some odd people who are expecting big things is special,'' 
Zimmer said. ``Hopefully the players will play well enough to get 
back to the World Series. I always said the goal should be to win 
the division, but we know that winning the Eastern Division 
championship is not good enough here. Other places you'd be tickled 
to death with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer doesn't shy away from New York's pressure and even  
challenged owner George Steinbrenner to fire him last week over the 
use of Hideki Irabu, whom The Boss called a ``fat ... toad,'' 
setting off Zimmer's first controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said he would quit before adhering to Steinbrenner's  
wishes and starting Irabu on Wednesday in place of Ramiro Mendoza. 
He held firm, even used Irabu for an inning of relief, and hasn't 
heard a complaint yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think George and I are very tight and we'll be all right. I  
did what The Boss said and pitched Irabu on Wednesday,'' Zimmer 
joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing up to Steinbrenner is easy for Zimmer, who already  
walked away from the game once in 1995. While serving as Don 
Baylor's bench coach in Colorado that year, Zimmer packed up his 
bags and left in the fifth inning of a game, not to return to 
baseball until Torre called him the next winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't like the way things were going so I went to Bob  
Gebhard, the team president, and told him about a week before that 
I was retiring on June 6 in the fifth inning,'' Zimmer said. ``Next 
I told Baylor and I think he thought I was really gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``So that day, I went to the clubhouse in the fifth inning,  
showered, took my fungo and my bag and watched the final two 
innings on television in my living room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer waited until Friday's game finished before leaving, then  
rushed out of the interview room with a big smile. The only way to 
end such a memorable day was with a memorable meal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have dinner with the boss,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A fraction of a second later, Zimmer realized he might have sent  
the wrong message. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' he said, ``not that Boss.''  
</P>
<P>
	It was his victory, but he had to share it with Torre, too.

<HEADLINE> Touted Amateur Field at the Masters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Hank Kuehne didn't realize the importance of  
the moment until he walked from the practice green to the first tee 
at Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	As he fought his way through the crowd, the U.S. Amateur  
champion heard Masters' officials call out the other players in his 
threesome: defending champion Mark O'Meara and European star Lee 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then it starts to hit you,'' Kuehne said. ``I'm usually a  
pretty relaxed person. I was shocked at how fast and heavy it hit 
me going to the first tee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After hooking his first tee shot onto the edge of the eighth  
fairway, Kuehne calmed himself and put together a respectable first 
round at the Masters on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	So did most of the others in the touted amateur field. Kuehne  
shot a 2-over-par 74, which made him only the fourth-best amateur 
on the day behind Spanish phenom Sergio Garcia (72), South African 
Trevor Immelman (72) and U.S. Amateur runner-up Tom McKnight (73), 
who birdied the final three holes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told us at the amateur dinner the other night that we  
were the best field they've ever had,'' Kuehne said. ``We've got a 
lot of good players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Kuchar, who paved the way a year ago with the best finish  
by an amateur since 1984, struggled to a 77, his flu-ridden body 
unable to cope with the sweltering Georgia heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was a little more of a fairy tale,'' said Kuchar,  
the Georgia Tech junior who finished 21st in the 1998 Masters. 
``This year, I'm under the weather and it's taking away some of the 
fairy tale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia -- ``El Nino'' -- picked up where Kuchar left off, and he  
took Immelman, McKnight and Kuehne along for the ride. All posted 
impressive scores amid the swirling wind and rock-hard greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little nervous at the beginning,'' said Garcia, who  
earned a spot in the tournament by winning the British Amateur. 
``But after three or four holes, I got so relaxed. ... I didn't 
feel nothing. It was like I was in a cloud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immelman, 19, was paired with countryman and three-time Masters  
champion Gary Player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a future champion today,'' said Player, who hugged  
Immelman after the round. ``He's got to be the best player in the 
world for a 19-year-old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Player didn't get a look at Garcia, who was in the  
threesome with Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniard bogeyed the first two holes after errant tee shots.  
He landed in a patch of trees along the left side of the first 
fairway, then hooked his shot at No. 2 into a ditch, forcing him to 
a take a one-shot penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia made the turn at 3-over, but he felt like things were  
about to turn for the better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just keep playing,'' he said under his breath, ``and the  
birdies will come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They did on the next two holes. At 10, he hit a 9-iron to within  
20 feet of the cup and made the putt. At 11, his 8-iron provided an 
easy -- by Augusta standards -- uphill putt from about seven feet. He 
missed a downhill seven-footer for birdie at 13, but made up for it 
four holes later by using his sand wedge from 127 yards to set up a 
10-foot birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuehne, who managed to strike cars on Washington Avenue with his  
booming shots on the practice range, closed with two birdies on the 
final four holes to put himself in position to make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The start of his round didn't go as well. Kuehne hooked his  
first tee shot over the pine trees on the left side of the fairway, 
through the adjacent ninth fairway and into the rough along No. 8. 
But, after some helpful advice from his playing partners, he 
managed to salvage a par. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told me the worst was over, it's all downhill from  
here,'' Kuehne recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old Kuchar felt bursts of energy, like his birdie  
putt from off the green at No. 9 that prompted a high-fiving 
exchange with several members of gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the day, though, he trudged around the course with a  
towel draped around his neck, looking downright wobbly. He even 
stopped along the ropes to grab a sweat-stained cap from his uncle, 
John, making a futile attempt to block out the sun as the 
thermometer climbed to 90 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Immelman won the U.S. Public Links title, which hardly made him  
one of the high-profile players entering the Masters. But he shook 
off an early case of the nerves and thoroughly enjoyed the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may not be heaven,'' Immelman said. ``But you can see it  
from here.''

<HEADLINE> Primedia To Set Up Web Subsidiaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Primedia Inc., publisher of specialty magazines  
including Modern Bride and Seventeen, plans to create two 
subsidiaries to manage its online operations, sources close to the 
company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Primedia's stock soared as much as 38 percent after the plan was  
first reported Thursday in Folio, a publishing industry magazine, 
as investors reaffirmed their hefty appetite for anything 
Internet-related. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources, who spoke on condition that they not be named, said  
that Primedia had no immediate plans to sell shares in the new 
subsidiaries to the public. The company is still looking for 
executives to head the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Formerly known as K-III, New York-based Primedia is controlled  
by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
	Primedia currently operates about 180 Web sites, most of which  
are related to the roughly 200 special interest and trade magazines 
it publishes. The company also publishes the Funk &AMP; Wagnalls 
encyclopedia and the World Almanac. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the new subsidiaries would mange the sites for consumer  
magazines, and the other would oversee sites for industry magazines 
targeted at business audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Primedia  
rose $3.37 1/2 per share, or 25 percent, to $16.93 3/4 after jumping as 
high as $18.68 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Other media companies are also hoping to tap the Wall Street  
frenzy for Internet companies by spinning off their online 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, computer magazine publisher Ziff-Davis Inc. issued a  
tracking stock for its ZDNet Group. Barnes &AMP; Noble is hoping to 
sell shares in its online bookstore, which is half-owned by German 
media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG.

<HEADLINE> Man Breaks Quarantine, Is Jailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A man with incurable tuberculosis was  
arrested and jailed in a special cell after violating a 
county-ordered quarantine and infecting his young grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Miguel Arredondo, 54, was quarantined to his apartment in  
Stockton two years ago and ordered to stay away from everyone 
except his wife, who chose to risk infection and live with him. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Joaquin Health Department even paid the rent, but one of  
his nurses alerted authorities after seeing one of his 
grandchildren go into the apartment last month. 
</P>
<P>
	A test showed his 1-year-old grandson and 2-year-old  
granddaughter are infected with the same drug-resistant strain of 
TB. The status of a third grandchild was not known. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Arredondo was on charges of violating an  
official health order, a misdemeanor that carries up to a year in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, his son, daughter and daughter-in-law face the same  
charge and child endangerment charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were all under written orders not to let the children  
contact their grandfather. They had been explained the dangers. 
They all knew. And they broke the quarantine anyway,'' prosecutor 
Stephen Taylor said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A public defender has not been appointed yet, and the  
whereabouts of the grandchildren was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who has prosecuted more than two dozen such cases, said  
the children are in grave danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little babies go fast'' when infected by this kind of  
tuberculosis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Dr. Karen Furst, a county health officer, said the  
children's prognosis is better than their grandfather's. 
</P>
<P>
	``When somebody's infected with a TB germ that is already  
drug-resistant they tend to do better in treatment'' than whoever 
infected them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Arredondo is being held in one of San Joaquin  
County's half-dozen ``negative air flow'' rooms. Air from the cell 
is sent outside the building rather than circulated into the jail's 
common ventilation system. 
</P>
<P>
	He is allowed no visitors, except for nurses.  
</P>
<P>
	Health officials fear Arredondo could spread the disease if  
deported to his native Mexico. Tuberculosis is an airborne disease 
spread only through prolonged, close-quarters contact. In most 
cases, it is easily cured. But if the disease goes undiagnosed or 
untreated, it can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	TB is increasingly becoming resistant to medication. There have  
been outbreaks of drug-resistant tuberculosis in Russia, the 
Dominican Republic, Argentina and the Ivory Coast.

<HEADLINE> Suu Kyi Seeks UN Action on Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu  
Kyi has called 1998 the worst year for repression by the military 
government through most of the '90s, with hundreds of her party 
members in jail and parts of their organization demolished. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nobel laureate also characterized the military's actions  
against her followers as criminal. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have suffered over the last year is far more than what  
we have suffered over the last six or seven years,'' Suu Kyi said 
in a videotaped message to the Geneva-based U.N. Commission on 
Human Rights. The tape was released in Bangkok today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-nation commission is holding its annual six-week meeting  
in Geneva to call attention to human rights abuses around the 
world. It also screened a videotape message from Suu Kyi last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Since late 1997, the Myanmar military, which closely monitors  
Suu Kyi to prevent her from conducting public political activities, 
has discouraged journalists from meeting with the opposition 
leader. Interviews with her are rare, and supporters have smuggled 
out her videotaped messages, including an address to the U.N. 
General Assembly last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In her latest message, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner  
appealed to the commission for a firm resolution to protect human 
rights in Myanmar, also known as Burma. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need now is more than just mere words. We need  
concrete action because our people are suffering,'' Suu Kyi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest from 1989-95 for leading  
the campaign for democracy in Myanmar, which has been ruled by the 
military since 1962. She was released from house arrest in 1995, 
but the regime has refused to enter into a dialogue with her. 
</P>
<P>
	Stonewalled, she and her National League for Democracy -- which  
won an overwhelming election victory in 1990 that the military has 
refused to honor -- said last May they would convene the parliament. 
But her defiant statement was met with a sharp escalation of 
repression by the military. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 party members were arrested, including members  
of parliament. Suu Kyi said 150 of the legislators are still in 
jail, as are about 300 to 400 party members. 
</P>
<P>
	The military has said more than 10,000 National League for  
Democracy members have resigned. Suu Kyi said the resignations were 
coerced by soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has come to the point when the activities of the regime are  
tantamount to criminal activities,'' Suu Kyi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The regime's hard line was demonstrated last month when it  
refused to grant a visa to Suu Kyi's husband, Michael Aris, who was 
terminally ill with cancer and wanted to visit his wife before he 
died. The military told Suu Kyi she should visit Aris in Britain. 
She declined, certain the authorities would not allow her to return 
to Myanmar. Aris died March 27 in a London hospital.

<HEADLINE> Cold April in Sun-Drenched S. Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles area is having an unusually  
cold and rainy April, and some Southern Californians, their closets 
full of tank tops and shorts, think the big chill isn't so cool. 
</P>
<P>
	The frigid spring had people bundled up in sweatshirts, jackets  
and gloves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know we have weird weather here but this is too much. I like  
it hot,'' Sharon Armstrong said. ``Now, I say forget about the 
beach. I just want to get home and get under my blanket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Southern California has had below-normal temperatures for a week  
as a series of Pacific storms rolled in. Daytime highs are usually 
in the mid-60s to low 70s in April but have been running about 10 
degrees lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Downtown Los Angeles reached a low of 45 degrees around dawn  
Friday. The mercury dropped to a record low of 36 in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shut up and deal with it,'' said Billy Neal, 45, of suburban  
Tujunga. ``It could always be worse. In Detroit, when it's 30 or 40 
degrees, they think it's a nice day. Trouble is, that's why we live 
in Southern California. It's so nice all the time.''

<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga.. (AP) -- Defending Masters champion Mark O'Meara is  
famous for his putter which helped produce two major championships 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara had one of those rare off days when he couldn't putt  
Friday and he shot a 4-over-par 76 that left him at 2-over-par 146. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had a good stroke all day,'' O'Meara said. ``I just  
didn't have the speed of the greens. I even three-putted twice. 
That's why a 76 popped up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara three-putted just once last year when he won the  
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of the fact that I was up there on the leaderboard  
for awhile,'' O'Meara said. ``It will take a lot of birdies for me 
to get back in this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ARNIE PLANS TO BE BACK:* Arnold Palmer didn't play the kind of  
golf he would like but he'll be back for his 46th consecutive 
Masters in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, who set a Masters record with his 45th consecutive  
appearance, shot 83-78 to miss the cut again. He hasn't made it 
since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people say I'm too old to be playing,'' Palmer said. ``As  
long as I can walk I'm gong to play. In fact, I made a birdie on 18 
so I'll definitely be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four-times champion added, ``I love playing in this event. I  
look into the gallery and if I don't know everyone in there I'm 
disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DANIEL'S DYNASTY:* Henry Daniel has been to more Masters than  
Doug Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	The 85-year-old Daniel is attending his 53rd consecutive Masters  
as a spectator. Ford holds the record for most Masters starts with 
47. Daniel has attended the tournament 53 consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel, of Decatur, Ga., is given the option of buying two $100  
tournament badges every year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first check I write every year is for my Masters  
tickets,'' said Daniel, a retired salesman.

<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PAR 3 CURSE STRIKES AGAIN:* It's not a good thing to win the  
Wednesday Par-3 tournament before the Masters. Just ask Joe Durant. 
</P>
<P>
	No Par-3 winner has ever won the regular tournament but what  
happened to Durant bordered on being cruel. 
</P>
<P>
	Durant, of Molino, Fla., and the 1998 Motorola Open winner, shot  
a 15-over-par 87 in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second round, Durant came back with a 79 and missed the  
cut. The only thing he got was the crystal vase for winning the 
par-3 tournament with a 5-under-par 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my first experience here and I learned a lot,'' he  
said. ``I learned what not to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to earn my way back to redeem myself. ''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GUARDS BEAT BUSHES FOR CELL PHONES:* Masters security is on  
high alert for spectactors with banned cell phones. 
</P>
<P>
	``They hide in the bushes to use them and that's how they get  
caught,'' one security guard said. 
</P>
<P>
	On one hole, a cell phone rang in a spectator's pocket and  
security officials rushed to him. They confiscated the phone and 
gave him a claim ticket to pick it up at the main gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameras are also banned but few spectators try to beat the  
system because they know they can be easily seen taking a picture. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MASTERS WEB SITE IS HOT:* Masters spokesman Glenn Greenspan  
said the tournament's Web site was averaging 238,000 hits per 
minute on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the day Greenspan said he expected Masters.org to  
have 1.5 million hits.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Patients' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- President Clinton portrayed Republicans as  
handmaidens of insurance and health-care companies today as 
Democrats launched a novel Internet petition drive to mobilize 
support for the ``patients' bill of rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who are against it -- basically the large HMOs and  
the insurers -- have got the ear of the congressional majority, and 
they have a lot of political influence,'' Clinton charged in a 
speech in one of Pennsylvania's most Democratic congressional 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the nation, House and Senate Democrats staged rallies and  
speeches in 32 states to ask Americans to raise their voices by 
petition for new health-care rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans warned Democrats against trying to ``poison'' the  
health-care reform process with ``partisan rhetoric and political 
gamesmanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most controversial, and most expensive, provision sought by  
Democrats would give patients the right to sue health plans and 
collect damages when they withhold treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	A modest crowd of perhaps a couple of hundred people had to  
strain to hear Clinton because of poor acoustics in historic 
Memorial Hall, built for the 1876 Centennial World's Fair in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton delighted the audience as he attempted to imitate  
Italian movie director Roberto Benigni's heavily accented lament in 
accepting a second Academy Award that, ``This is a terrible 
mistake, because I used up all my English.'' Clinton used the same 
language to say that earlier speakers had said all that needed to 
be said at Memorial Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The historic surroundings were chosen to invoke memories of the  
Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of 
Rights. Clinton recalled that citizens of Philadelphia, in 1701, 
launched the first successful petition drive in the New World and 
won the right to practice any religion they chose. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to Clinton's speech, Republicans said they have been  
working hard with Democrats to come up with an acceptable HMO bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a way to make health care more accountable to  
patients without raising costs and limiting access, we have a 
responsibility to do it, and do it this year,'' said Rep. John 
Boehner, R-Ohio, chairman of the House employer-employee relations 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP presidential hopeful Steve Forbes criticized Clinton for  
wanting ``to pile on all kinds of new rules and regulations'' that 
would drive up the cost of health care. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the trial lawyers say `jump,' President Clinton and the  
liberal Democrats ask, `How high?''' Republican National Committee 
Chairman Jim Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said polls show that more than 70 percent of Americans  
support the health-care changes, but ``the system in Washington is 
resisting it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Democrats' proposal would fail ``unless there is a  
clear, unambiguous signal from the people of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said opponents were consoling themselves that the  
Democrats ``probably can't break through on the evening news 
tonight because of Kosovo,'' and ``that's another excuse we'll have 
to let this thing slide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said new figures show his executive action last  
year extending HMO protections to federal employees and their 
dependents costs less than $1 per person per month. 
</P>
<P>
	The president lacks the power to unilaterally extend to federal  
workers the right to sue health plans and collect damages when they 
withhold treatment. Nor has Clinton required the plans to pay for 
``medically necessary'' care, as determined by doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton directed the government to proceed with plans to  
require federal workers' health plans to adopt two popular 
provisions: 
</P>
<P>
	--Mandatory release of information about customer satisfaction,  
the quality of doctors and hospitals and how doctors are paid. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allowance for patients to stay with their doctors for 90 days  
if the doctor is dropped from the network while patients are in the 
middle of a treatment or pregnancy. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Web Site Identifies Speed Traps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- An Internet Web site that identifies speed  
traps throughout the nation features 60 places in Wisconsin where 
authorities give out speeding tickets at a rapid pace. 
</P>
<P>
	About 250,000 people visit speedtrap.com every day said Andrew  
Warner, an Atlanta computer network engineer who created the Web 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	The site allows people to post the location where they received  
a speeding ticket. It receives about 100 new postings each week, 
Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner said he cleans up profanity and deletes names of police  
officers, but anything else is fair game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tend to be fairly liberal content-wise, as long as it's not  
profanity,'' Warner said. ``People wish to vent about their ticket, 
and I don't think there's any harm in letting them get colorful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One person said of Eagle River, ``This is not a good town to  
speed in. The cops here are frustrated because there is nothing 
better for them to do but to pull people over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of Mellen police, one person said, ``Local Barney Fife police  
force likes to camp out near the railroad tracks on the south end 
of town. ... Only Mellen residents are allowed to slide on fines. 
If you are from out of state, LOOK OUT!'' 
</P>
<P>
	A posting for Rhinelander warns, ``Out of state traffic beware!  
Police usually give tickets for 5 over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rhinelander Police Chief James Sebestyen disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's totally insane,'' Sebestyen said Thursday. ``There's no  
truth to that. Quite frankly, we don't have the manpower at 
regulating everyone at 5 over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Town of East Troy police Sgt. Jeffrey McSwain read his  
community, ``is a small town with some bored cops. ... Look out! 
Any revenue the city can generate from either out-of-towners or 
those residing in the town is taken without hesitation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McSwain said he was not upset by the harsh words.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got a chuckle out of it,'' he said. ``I don't know (if) it's  
the result of bored cops. I like to think it's what the citizens of 
East Troy want us to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speedtrap.com. also includes information about the type of  
speed-measuring technology; average cost of a speeding ticket; type 
of law enforcement vehicle; and scanner frequency. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas has the most postings, while Rhode Island, Alaska and the  
Dakotas bring up the rear.

	Cypriot Fails To Free U.S. Soldiers  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Former Cypriot President Spyros  
Kyprianou said today his mission to win the release of three U.S. 
soldiers failed because of ``intensified heavy bombing'' by NATO 
forces. Kyprianou met with President Slobodan Milosevic for 90 
minutes and afterward told reporters that he had failed to secure 
the soldiers' release. ``The intensified heavy bombing of the last 
couple of days made my humanitarian mission more difficult,'' 
Kyprianou said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accused Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic today of presenting an ``illusion of partial 
compliance'' with NATO demands in Kosovo by declaring a cease-fire 
after violently chasing nearly 1 million ethnic Albanians from the 
province. Clinton said the ethnic rout won't stand and NATO 
airstrikes will continue. ``He hopes we will accept as permanent 
the results of his ethnic cleansing. We will not,'' Clinton said.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Powerful storms swept across the Plains and  
Midwest, destroying homes and downing power lines in several states 
and killing at least six people. The Cincinnati area was 
particularly hard-hit. Entire blocks were destroyed as strong 
thunderstorms moved through before dawn today in the southwest Ohio 
city's upscale suburbs of Blue Ash and Montgomery. Roofs were torn 
off stores, and water spewed into the air from broken fire 
hydrants.

troops and tanks reportedly swarmed the streets of Niger's capital, 
Niamey. U.S. officials reported the country's prime minister had 
announced that the National Assembly had been dissolved and all 
political activity suspended. Mainassara seized power in a January

	Help Sought for Cancer Fatigue  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Studies suggest that over 75 percent of cancer  
patients getting chemotherapy of radiation suffer serious fatigue, 
yet few patients seek or receive treatment to combat the problem. A 
recent survey of 379 cancer patients found only 9 percent of those 
who suffered fatigue were treated with prescription drugs or blood 
transfusions. Undertreated pain is another big cause, limiting 
patients' sleep.

coffee-makers in a nasty trade war involving bananas. The final 
list excluded a number of products on the original target list,

the Yankees' home opener. Berra, wearing a Yankee cap, walked 
slowly out to the mound as announcer Bob Sheppard introduced him as 
``a true leader and a man of conviction.'' Berra had vowed never to 
return to the stadium after being fired as Yankees manager just 16

<HEADLINE> Markets Are Not Always Rational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't try to tell investors in bond and money  
market mutual funds that the financial markets are always rational 
and efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	When they comparison-shop among high-quality and high-yield bond  
funds, taxable and tax-exempt bond funds, or taxable and tax-exempt 
money funds, they find some amazing anomalies and inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
	For example: Often in recent years, funds investing in  
lower-quality ``junk'' bonds get so popular that their yields 
barely exceed those of funds concentrating on bonds with safer 
credit ratings. You don't have to resist temptation to steer clear 
of junk bonds at those points; the cost of greater safety is very 
small. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Russian default last August, quality spreads in the  
bond market widened dramatically almost overnight. Then investors 
were offered much more generous rewards for taking the extra risks 
that come with lower-rated bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	By the tally of the newsletter Income Fund Outlook in Deerfield  
Beach, Fla., yields on junk bond funds lately have averaged about 
9.4 percent, compared to 5.7 percent for funds owning higher-rated 
corporate bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Second example: Look at the gap between yields on corporate bond  
investments, which pay interest that is subject to income tax, and 
municipal bond investments, which pay interest that is exempt from 
federal income taxes and sometimes state income taxes as well. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the time lately, muni-bond yields have hovered  
between 90 percent and 100 percent of comparable taxable yields. If 
these markets were truly efficient, you'd think muni yields would 
be much lower, given that most investors face federal tax rates of 
at least 28 percent on each extra dollar of taxable income they 
receive. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, there are many factors that can explain yield spreads at  
any given time. Lots of taxable bonds, for one thing, are owned by 
investors such as pension plans that don't have to pay current 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, from the point of view of an individual investor  
buying for a taxable account, the markets look very inefficient. 
Suppose you are an investor in the 28 percent bracket, evaluating a 
muni fund that yields 5 percent against a taxable bond fund that 
yields 5.5 percent. Reduce 5.5 by 28 percent, and you get an 
after-tax yield of 3.96 percent -- more than a full point less than 
the after-tax yield available to you from the muni fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Interestingly, if you make the same kind of calculation in  
today's short-term money market, the comparison comes out just as 
lopsided in the other direction, in favor of taxable funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The average tax-free money fund currently produces a yield of  
2.5 percent per annum,'' notes the Income Fund Outlook. ``Even for 
investors in the top 39.6 percent federal bracket, a 2.5 percent 
tax-free return is the equivalent of only a 4.1 percent taxable 
yield. The average taxable money field is yielding more than 4.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put it another way, an investor in the 39.6 percent bracket  
who holds the average taxable money fund yielding 4.5 percent will 
net more after taxes, 2.7 percent, than he or she would earn in the 
average tax-free fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any way you slice it, tax-free money funds are a dubious  
investment at this juncture. If you hold tax-free money funds, you 
should compare your after-tax returns on an alternative taxable 
fund with what your tax-free fund is currently earning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In most cases, it is a simple maneuver to switch your money from  
a tax-exempt fund to a taxable money fund, perhaps even one 
operating in the same fund family. 
</P>
<P>
	The same discrepancies might not exist the next time you revisit  
these markets, looking for the best place to put your money. They 
could have vanished by then -- or, just possibly, they might be even 
more pronounced than they have been lately. 
</P>
<P>
	The point is, you can't ever assume that the professionals have  
arbitraged away all imbalances in the markets where you invest, 
making it unnecessary for you to do any research on your own. A 
cheap hand-held calculator can still be a valuable investment 
tool.

<HEADLINE> 31 Acts Announced for Woodstock '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Limp Bizkit? Korn? Rage Against the Machine?  
It's not your father's Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
	That's precisely the point. Woodstock '99 promoters announced a  
31-act lineup Thursday geared to teens and 20-year-olds that, so 
far at least, doesn't include one performer from the namesake 
festival in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dave Matthews Band, Jewel, Metallica and Alanis Morissette  
are this year's headliners for the three-day show, scheduled for 
July 23-25. It will be held at Griffiss Park, an abandoned Air 
Force base in Rome, N.Y., about 50 miles west of Albany. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers expect a crowd of about 250,000 people for the show,  
which also features Fatboy Slim, Sugar Ray, Creed, Counting Crows, 
Rusted Root, the Offspring, the Brian Setzer Orchestra, George 
Clinton and Willie Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	Six acts that played the 25-year anniversary concert, which drew  
an estimated 350,000 people to Saugerties, N.Y., are coming back: 
Metallica, Aerosmith, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sheryl Crow, Live and 
Collective Soul. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three more days of mud, noise and logistical nightmares?''  
said Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich. ``Wouldn't miss it for the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although DMX and Ice Cube are included, the lineup is short on  
rap acts. Promoters say they expect to add six to 10 more acts. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers promise better security than at the first two  
Woodstocks, which were overrun by gatecrashers. Instead of the 
flimsy 6-foot chainlink fence that surrounded the Woodstock '94 
site, Griffiss will be ringed by a 12-foot plywood fence backed 
with steel girders. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticket packages including bus transportation will go on sale  
April 18, with prices starting at $249.99.

<HEADLINE> Teen Olympiad, Family End Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- After enormous success at a young age -- followed  
by a high-profile rift with her parents -- Olympic gold medalist 
Dominique Moceanu may have finally found peace. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old gymnast and her parents have reached a  
confidential financial settlement and ended a protective order 
against her father, the Houston Chronicle and The Dallas Morning 
News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an extremely difficult time for my family, and I  
hope that we can now begin to move forward in support of one 
another,'' Miss Moceanu said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that deep down my father loves me, and of course I love  
him, so I need to find a way in my heart to give him forgiveness. I 
hope there is a chance that someday things in my family can be 
normal again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, signed Thursday by Family Law Judge Patricia  
Lykos, was kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
	The family fight erupted publicly last October, when Miss  
Moceanu sued for her independence, saying her father, Dumitru 
Moceanu, had squandered the money she had earned in a 10-year 
professional career. She was declared a legal adult Oct. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Moceanu's parents placed her earnings in a trust fund,  
which they administer. She did not have access to the trust until 
she turned 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father has said all of his daughter's earnings went into  
building a 70,000-square-foot gym with Miss Moceanu's blessings. He 
has refused to say how much the gym cost, but his attorney 
Katherine Scardino said it was about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The gymnast sought and won a court order on Dec. 9 that kept her  
father at least 500 feet away after police said they were

<HEADLINE> Suns' Longley Hyperextends Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Phoenix Suns center Luc Longley  
hyperextended his left knee Friday night in a first-quarter 
collision with Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone. 
</P>
<P>
	Just five minutes into the game, Malone faked Longley into the  
air and attempted to drive past him. The 7-foot-2 Longley landed 
awkwardly while trying to avoid Malone and had to be helped off the 
floor and to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Team doctors diagnosed the injury as a hyperextension of the  
left knee, but it wasn't immediately known how long Longley would 
be out. He wasn't expected to return Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Longley is averaging 9.1 points in 31 games with the Suns this  
season. He spent the previous 4 1/2 seasons in Chicago, where he won 
three NBA titles as the Bulls' starting center.

<HEADLINE> Europe Oil Cos. To Gain in Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The United Nations decision to end economic  
sanctions against Libya will give the country's underdeveloped oil 
industry access to the spare parts and money needed to expand 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	That should also be a boon to foreign oil companies that do  
business in Libya, but American companies will be left at a 
competitive disadvantage because sanctions imposed by the U.S. 
government remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations on Monday suspended its seven-year  
restrictions on trade with Libya, ending a ban on international 
flights there. The world body acted after Libya handed over two 
citizens suspected of blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, 
Scotland, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see a great future in Libya, and certainly the lifting of  
sanctions will make life a whole lot easier,'' said Andrew Harber, 
a manager in Britain for the Swedish company Lundin Oil AB. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.N. action is unlikely to unleash a fresh wave of  
European oil companies into Libya, analysts say, because most firms 
with an interest in the country are already operating there. For 
them, U.N. sanctions were more of an inconvenience than a real 
impediment. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, new, direct flights to the Libyan capital will save time  
for visiting managers and drilling crews, who previously had to 
drive to Tripoli from the neighboring country of Tunisia, a 
five-hour journey. Only two days after the sanctions were lifted, 
British Airways announced it would start flying three flights a 
week from London to Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
	The new relations will also likely mean faster international  
money transfers that should help companies complete their projects 
more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	With proven reserves of 30 billion barrels, Libya has as much  
oil as Norway and Britain combined. Its reserves are smaller than 
Mexico's 50 billion barrels, but larger than those of fellow OPEC 
members Nigeria and Indonesia. And its low-sulfur crude fetches a 
premium on global markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Libya also has natural gas reserves of 45.9 trillion cubic feet,  
comparable to those of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Libyans have managed to keep up steady levels of crude  
production despite U.N. and U.S. sanctions, pumping 1.39 million 
barrels a day last year, according to the International Energy 
Agency. Promising areas of the country remain to be explored. 
Lundin, the Swedish firm, is prospecting at En Naga in the Sahara, 
620 miles southeast of Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Conoco Inc. first struck oil in Libya in 1955.  
Since withdrawing from Libya 13 years ago, Conoco has had to forgo 
the production and sale of 300 million barrels of oil worth $5 
billion, company spokesman Carlton Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
	European energy companies such as Italy's ENI, Repsol of Spain  
and Austria's OMV helped fill the void created by the American 
exodus. 
</P>
<P>
	The competitive position of U.S. companies will erode further if  
non-U.S. firms are the only ones allowed to do business in Libya, 
Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one likes to sit on their hands while their competitors are  
out there looking for oil. Libya is a proven producer, it has a lot 
of reserves and it's close to European markets,'' said Peter Bogin 
of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a Paris-based consulting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	For Libya's oil industry, sanctions have hurt most by blocking  
imports of certain types of equipment. The U.S. embargo continues 
to deny Libya access to specific technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanctions also have stifled investment. Since 1996, the U.S.  
Iran-Libya Sanctions Act has barred foreign firms from making new 
investments of $40 million or more -- a ceiling that European 
companies seem to be respecting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a difficult environment in which to operate, but  
certainly not an impossible one,'' said Bogin, of the Paris 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Libya's production capacity will expand slowly, but in the long  
run, analysts say, the improvements may embolden it to pump more 
oil than its OPEC production limits allow. 
</P>
<P>
	Libyan diplomats in London refused to comment when asked about  
this possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center for Global Energy  
Studies in London, said Libya already has one of the worst records 
of compliance with OPEC production limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Libya is one of those countries that pay lip service to an  
agreement but then don't comply fully,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
	Goodrich has agreed to acquire Coltec in a $1.9 billion deal  
that would create the largest producer of aircraft landing systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was approved by about 96 percent of the Coltec

</P>
<P>
	The merger must still be cleared by the Federal Trade  
Commission. The companies are also involved in a lawsuit filed by 
two competitors, AlliedSignal and Crane Company, which want to

<HEADLINE>  UN Refugee Chief Tours Kosovar Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZDA, Macedonia (AP) -- The U.N. refugee chief toured one of  
the largest of the tent camps to have sprung up in Macedonia and 
Albania in the past week, trying to bring order today to the care 
of nearly a half million displaced Kosovo Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata gently turned  
back an ethnic Albanian boy who ran up to her in the Brazda camp, 
home to 25,000 refugees, demanding to know when he could go back to 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to go there too,'' Ogata told the boy. ``We can  
go back when we could go there safely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting adequate food, blankets and shelters to the refugees  
scattered across Albania and Macedonia is still a work in progress. 
NATO troops put up the first of 2,000 tents at Brazda a week ago, 
when Serb forces were reportedly forcing ethnic Albanians out of 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogata was to talk later today with the president and prime  
minister of Macedonia, where there has been reluctance to take in 
the refugees -- now numbering 105,000 in Macedonia and 320,000 in 
Albania, according to the UNHCR. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugee influx has heightened tensions in the region. This  
week, Macedonia cleared 60,000 to 65,000 refugees from roughly the 
same area of a no man's land between Macedonia and Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	UNHCR spokeswoman Paula Ghedini said today that Macedonia had  
agreed to let the U.N. agency remove a final 1,200 refugees from 
another stretch of no man's land. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said it would work with the UNHCR in future mass  
movements of refugees, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UNHCR also finally had accounted for 10,000 refugees who  
dropped off its radar screens in the mass deportation from the 
border zone, Ghedini said. They were in Albania, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogata urged NATO troops at the Brazda camp to take names of the  
refugees to help track and care for them. British NATO troops said 
they still had yet to get registration forms. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO troops at the camp are slowly turning over the basic chores  
of running the camps to aid agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think of this place, conceived, planned and implemented in one  
week,'' Ogata said, as refugees emerged from their tents, and 
mothers cleaned and groomed their children for the day. ``That 
takes a large military organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, Belgium, NATO said it would send about 8,000 troops  
to Albania to help with logistics, infrastructure and coordination 
at airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The main airport in Albania's capital, Tirana, has been swamped  
with flights bringing in tons of aid from more than 30 countries 
that responded with pledges to help UNHCR deal with the tide of 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, 15 humanitarian flights requested clearance to land  
at Tirana's airport, but only eight were allowed to land, said U.N. 
spokesman Fred Eckhard in New York. Another 14 planes are scheduled 
to land today at Tirana. 
</P>
<P>
	While tens of thousands of refugees have been housed in  
makeshift camps near the border town of Kukes, still others have 
been spread out to cities and towns throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Albanian town of Korca, 12,000 Kosovo Albanians shipped  
out of the Macedonian border zone were camped in a sports arena, 
without mattresses or running water.

<HEADLINE> Bombing Casts Pall Over Serb Easter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On the eve of Orthodox Easter on Sunday, many  
Serbian-Americans and other Eastern Christians say the NATO bombing 
in Yugoslavia is casting a pall over their holiest day. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least let us have our Easter in peace,'' said Menka  
Subaric, 16, who attended Holy Thursday services with her mother at 
Holy Resurrection Serbian Orthodox Cathedral in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Orthodox Easter, Yugoslavian President Slobodan  
Milosevic declared a cease-fire this weekend in his campaign to 
crush rebels in Kosovo. But the NATO bombing continued, as it did 
last weekend despite pleas from Roman Catholic bishops who asked 
for a break in honor of Easter. 
</P>
<P>
	A group called the Coalition for Peace in the Balkans bought a  
full-page ad in Thursday's New York Times with the message: ``God 
will bless you, President Clinton, if you drop food, not bombs, 
this Orthodox Easter.'' Those signing the ad included lawyer Plato 
Cacheris, writer Nicholas Gage and film director Costa Gavras. 
</P>
<P>
	Misha Bjelic, attending services at St. Sava Cathedral in New  
York, said the Serbs ``need a little break to pray and pay respects 
for the dead. It's something you expect from Christians when you 
are at war with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Good Friday churchgoers lit candles in the ornate hall of St.  
Steven's Serbian Orthodox Church in Los Angeles, a clergyman 
reflected the tensions by asking a reporter to leave. ``You can 
imagine how we feel,'' he said, declining to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbian Orthodox Church is part of the Orthodox Christian  
Church, a fellowship of 15 self-governing churches with an 
estimated 1.5 million members in the United States. The Orthodox 
Church of the East and the Roman Catholic Church split in the Great 
Schism in the year 1054. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the two groups share basic tenets, but the Orthodox do not  
follow the pope. Eastern churches follow the Julian calendar, while 
Western churches use the Gregorian, which explains their differing 
dates for Easter. 
</P>
<P>
	Metropolitan Christopher, head of the Serbian Orthodox Church in  
the United States, said he will not discuss the bombing of Kosovo 
during Easter services. ``We're preaching the resurrection of 
Christ,'' he said. ``We take our cue from the Lord: `My kingdom is 
not of this world.''' 
</P>
<P>
	At Holy Resurrection in Chicago, the Rev. Dennis Pavichevich  
said Easter has actually helped many people cope with the war 
because the holiday ``is all full of life over death, righteousness 
over sin and promise of eternity.''

	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Soviet Line took the lead in the stretch  
and then held off Trail City by a nose to win Friday's $110,800 
Grade III Maker's Mark Mile at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Jorge Velazquez, Soviet Line was timed in 1:35 1-5 in  
the race for older horses. It was another neck back to Rob 'n Gin,

	Sheik Maktoum al Maktoum's Gainsborough Farm owns Soviet Line, a  
9-year-old Irish-bred gelding who has raced throughout the world 
and was the oldest horse in the race. Friday's win was his 16th in 
46 career starts. The purse of $68,696 increased his career 
earnings to $1,431,767. 
</P>
<P>
	The third choice in the betting, Soviet Line paid $8, $3.80 and  
$3.40. Trail City, who rallied from last place to be second, 
returned $3.40 and $2.80. Rob 'n Gin paid $3.80 to show.

<HEADLINE> Genentech May Pay $50M Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. (AP) -- The Justice Department is  
considering a proposed $50 million settlement from Genentech Inc. 
to end a five-year investigation of the drug company's marketing of 
a human growth hormone. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposal disclosed Friday by Genentech called for the company  
to pay a criminal fine and restitution to end a probe into 
allegations that for nine years it promoted the hormone Protropin 
for uses not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that it is better for the company, our shareholders  
and the patients we serve to achieve closure on the issue rather 
than risk the cost and distraction of protracted litigation,'' 
Arthur D. Levinson, Genentech's president and chief executive 
officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, Genentech shares fell 68 3/4 cents to close at $84.81 1/4  
a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Approximately 30,000 children are treated with growth hormones  
in the United States yearly. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech began marketing Protropin in 1985. In 1994, the FDA  
raised concern that the drug was being prescribed to children who 
were short but otherwise healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limited use of  
growth hormones, such as for children who have hormone deficiencies 
or a rare chromosomal abnormality. It has cautioned that attempts 
to boost a child's height for cosmetic reasons could lead to 
tumors, diabetes, hip problems or difficulties with the child's 
self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 survey by the American Medical Association revealed 40  
percent of Protropin patients were receiving the drug for federally 
unapproved treatments. It is against the law for companies to 
promote drugs for use in unapproved ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech, the world's top biotech firm, earned $181.9 million  
on $1.06 billion in sales in 1998. The company said any settlement 
amount would be recorded as a special charge to its first-quarter 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed deal would be subject to court approval.

<HEADLINE> Expos President Happy With Crowd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Expos president Claude Brochu, a target of angry  
fans who accuse him of trying to sabotage efforts to keep the team 
from moving, insisted Friday he was happy to see a nearly full 
house for Montreal's home opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great,'' Brochu said after 43,918 came to Olympic  
Stadium for the Expos' win over the New York Mets on Thursday 
night. ``I thought we'd get 35,000. To get 44,000 was 
extraordinary. We sold 20,000 tickets in the last few hours. It was 
a nice testimony. It showed our fans support us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brochu, the team's general partner, has been under criticism  
since last year, when the Expos failed to get government financing 
for a new stadium. Brochu and baseball commissioner Bud Selig say 
the team can't survive in Montreal without a new ballpark, and 
groups in Washington, northern Virginia and Charlotte, N.C., have 
expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Expos chairman Jacques Menard has been at odds with Brochu, but  
Menard also failed to secure stadium financing. 
</P>
<P>
	A smattering of anti-Brochu signs were visible among the opening  
night crowd, some repeating slogans from the almost daily attacks 
on him in the local sports pages. 
</P>
<P>
	``My evaluation is that it was a nice crowd,'' Brochu said.  
``People were here to have fun. There were maybe 10 or 20 signs. I 
saw it as a crowd that was there to support the club, not to 
challenge Claude Brochu.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Brochu has hired a bodyguard he calls his ``chauffeur.''  
</P>
<P>
	``People have been very nice, respectful and polite,'' he said,  
adding that his personal safety ``doesn't preoccupy me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As you say, it only takes one idiot. You've got to be more  
careful, that's all. You don't want to leave it to after the 
fact,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brochu has been criticized for refusing to take a $10 million  
buyout for his 7.6 percent share of the team and to step aside as 
general partner. He has insisted he's ready to step aside once 
Menard has a workable plan in place, including government support 
for a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always had very solid fan support,'' said Brochu. ``But  
I make a distinction between fan support and corporate support. 
`We've always had a good walk up of baseball fans. Where it's 
difficult is getting the corporate community to buy season tickets 
and boxes.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Must Pay $909M to Thrift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge ordered the federal government Friday  
to pay $909 million to a California savings and loan, the first of 
what may be numerous damage awards over a 1989 accounting rule 
change that plunged many thrifts into financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Judge Loren Smith of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims told  
the government to pay Glendale Federal Bank for breach of contract. 
Glendale had hoped for an award of $1 billion to $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling stems from a 1996 Supreme Court decision that said  
the government broke its contract with Glendale and two other 
thrifts when it changed the rules on how they must count their 
assets. The justices said the government could be forced to pay 
damages to the S&AMP;Ls for their financial harm. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar damage claims have been filed against the government by  
about 125 other thrifts, many of which were declared insolvent 
after the 1989 rule change. Some of them have reached financial 
settlements with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Glendale case was the first to reach a judge's decision  
on how much the government must pay, and it was being closely 
watched for the standards it might set for assessing the other 
thrifts' claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's opinion said he ``strongly believes that settlements,  
where fair compromise occurs, are in everyone's interest. The court 
calls upon all parties involved in pending cases to consider what 
alternatives, short of continuing litigation over the coming years, 
may resolve these cases fairly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Smith issued his decision in late afternoon -- after the  
stock markets closed -- observers said that no matter how he ruled, 
one side or the other could be expected to file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1989 accounting rule change was part of the government's  
effort to rescue the then-troubled thrift industry -- a cleanup that 
overall has cost about $200 billion. The federal law that brought 
about the change tightened rules and provided money to close 
insolvent S&AMP;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, the government had encouraged healthy thrifts to  
take over insolvent ones by letting them count the insolvent S&AMP;L's 
losses as ``goodwill'' assets. The rule change said S&AMP;Ls no longer 
could count such assets toward their minimum capital requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule forced many previously healthy S&AMP;Ls into the red.  
Among them was Glendale, which had taken over a troubled thrift and 
counted $716 million as goodwill assets. After the rule change, 
Glendale had to raise about $450 million to meet its capital 
minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	The government insisted to the Supreme Court that it never  
promised the S&AMP;Ls they would be protected from rule changes. But 
the justices decided otherwise in a 7-2 ruling that exposed the 
government to the possibility of paying billions of dollars in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would, indeed, have been madness'' for the S&AMP;Ls to agree to  
take over ailing thrifts without a binding promise that they could 
rely on the accounting rules then in effect, Justice David H. 
Souter wrote for the nation's highest court in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Glendale's case then returned to Smith to set the amount of  
damages the government must pay. The S&AMP;L's lawyers sought to boost 
the award by arguing Glendale was entitled to recover all the 
profits it would have made if the rules had not changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Glendale has since merged with California Federal Bank, which is  
owned by Golden State Bancorp of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Glendale's representatives say other industries -- including  
electric utilities and low-income housing developers -- may be able 
to use the 1996 Supreme Court ruling to argue that the federal 
government broke promises to them and should be forced to pay 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The case acted on Friday is Glendale Federal Bank vs. U.S.,  
90-772C.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended the week higher  
Friday on the back of another record rally overnight on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, the key index surged more than 5 percent on active  
foreign buying in selected blue chips following Thursday's rise on 
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 112.39 
points -- 1.1 percent -- to close at 10,197.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said there were also expectations of lower interest  
rates in Asia after the European Central Bank cut its key interest 
rate half a point Thursday to 2.5 percent in the first reduction 
since the euro currency was launched Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 5.3 percent,  
or 21.211 points, to a year high of 421.213. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in Hong Kong also closed sharply higher, boosted by  
expectations of a cut in local interest rates as well as by record 
gains overnight on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 186.26 points, or 1.59 percent, to close at 
11,914.10, its highest level in 12 months. On Thursday, the index 
gained 112.97 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said shares prices rose on expectations that Hong Kong  
banks would cut interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	After the market closed, the Hong Kong Association of Banks  
announced that it was cutting deposit rates by a quarter-point, to 
3.75 percent. Major banks also cut their lending rates for their 
best customers to 8.50 percent from 8.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the key index rose for the fifth consecutive day.  
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 8.94 points,  
or 0.05 percent, closing the week at 16,855.63 points. On Thursday, 
the average climbed 292.19 points, or 1.77 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	With continued buying by foreign investors, market sentiment was  
rather bullish for much of Friday, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was buoyed up in the morning by heavy buying related  
to the special quotation cash settlement of April options 
contracts, pushing the Nikkei above 17,000 for the first time since 
March 30, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 120.96 yen at late  
afternoon, up 0.20 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but below its 
late New York level of 121.37 overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian share market closed at a record high in active  
trading, capping off a strong week. Buoyed by an all-time closing 
high on Wall Street overnight, and perceptions of a solid 
Australian economy, the market did enough to break a new high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney's All Ordinaries Index rose 3.8 points, or 0.1  
percent, to 3,060.0. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was closed in the Philippines for a public holiday.  
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed slightly lower in volatile trading.  
The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 7.71 points, or 
0.1 percent, to 7,265.70. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed sharply higher,  
buoyed by strong investor demand for blue-chip stocks. The 
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 48.85 points, or 2.3 percent, 
to 2,171.09. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed as aggressive foreign buying  
offset profit-taking by local retail investors. The Korea Composite 
Stock Price Index rose 6.23 points, or 0.9 percent, to 687.42, its 
highest close since Sept. 19, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed higher on foreign  
investors' optimism and speculation that interest rates could fall 
further in the medium term. The key Composite Index rose 11.52 
points, or 2.07 percent, to 568.10. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed higher. The benchmark Straits  
Times Index rose 1.4 percent, or 23.65 points, to 1,665.26.

<HEADLINE> GM Considers Building New Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. has taken major steps toward  
building its first new U.S. assembly plant in a decade. But the 
world's largest automaker says the plan is far from a done deal, 
given hurdles that include potentially contentious talks with the 
United Auto Workers. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the preliminary legal work, GM has applied for an  
air-quality permit from the state and has begun clearing land next 
to its plant in Lansing, Mich., where Oldsmobile Aleros and Pontiac 
Grand Ams are made, spokesman Kyle Johnson said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, he said, ``there's a lot that needs to happen prior  
to really stating that we've got a `go' program here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among them: GM has to reach agreement with the UAW on work rules  
and employment levels, get approval from the state and GM's board, 
and pin down such issues as tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant would be GM's first new assembly plant since the  
Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., opened in 1990. It also would 
be the first new GM factory built in Michigan since the 
Detroit-Hamtramck Cadillac factory opened in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson would not speculate about the plant's possible product  
line or volume, other than to say that ``any plant we have up there 
will be flexible and have the ability to build a variety of 
vehicles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lansing State Journal reported Friday that GM documents  
filed with the state suggest the plant would make 211,000 vehicles 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
	In its air-permit application, GM refers to the Lansing factory  
as a ``Sigma'' project without specifying what type of vehicle 
could be built. Industry analysts say Sigma is the code name for a 
global GM project that, in North America, would involve several 
models of Cadillacs, including replacements for the Catera, Seville 
and perhaps Eldorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit News reported Friday the project would cost $350  
million and that the plant would build Cadillacs. The Detroit Free 
Press said GM wants to build the plant to make a replacement for 
the Catera and similar midsize cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson declined to discuss the plant's estimated cost or its  
possible work force. GM already is Lansing's largest private 
employer, with some 13,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also would not discuss to what extent, if any, the  
possible plant might feature ``modular assembly'' methods, in which 
preassembled parts modules are delivered to the plant by outside 
suppliers. Far fewer UAW workers would be needed to assemble each 
car because most of the subassembly work would done by the 
lower-cost suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging that GM sees ``some distinct advantages'' to  
modular assembly, Johnson said ``the program is not fully defined 
and some of those issues will need to be negotiated'' with the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to speculate where that's going to end up,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	National contract talks between the UAW and GM, Ford Motor Co.  
and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG are scheduled to begin 
in June. UAW President Stephen Yokich has said modular assembly 
would be a major issue in the negotiations, given union concerns 
that the practice could reduce jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, UAW Local President Ralph Shepard said he hadn't yet  
seen what GM plans in detail, though he said union representatives 
plan to meet with GM in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go in and put together a business case to put  
another plant in this city, and we're confident we're going to be 
able to do that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Any talks between the UAW and the automaker assuredly would  
touch upon modular assembly, Shepard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are always concerns about any time you outsource a  
product,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But for cost and flexibility reasons, ``GM would be foolish not  
to be considering some form of modular assembly or a plant that 
very much incorporates supplier participation,'' AutoPacific Inc. 
analyst Eric Noble said Friday.

<HEADLINE> SEC Acts Against New Utopia Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the tax deadline less than a week away, a  
tax-free haven in the Caribbean may sound alluring. But would you 
believe a country called New Utopia, built on concrete platforms on 
an underwater land mass? 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, investors fell for it on the Internet and sank  
money into a phony $350 million bond offering, federal securities 
regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
	And a federal judge in Tulsa, Okla., on Friday granted the  
Securities and Exchange Commission's request for an emergency 
restraining order against Lazarus R. Long, who calls himself Prince 
Lazarus, and his New Utopia company. 
</P>
<P>
	The order by Judge Michael Burrage freezes all money raised by  
Long through the alleged fraudulent scheme, estimated at around 
$100,000. Burrage scheduled a hearing for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Long called the SEC's case a ``witch-hunt'' but said he has  
complied with the commission's request to stop selling the bonds 
and will return the investors' money. He said he wants people to be 
able to continue donating money to the New Utopia government. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are trying to make a big-name case of this because we've  
had so much publicity. We haven't done anything wrong,'' he told 
the Tulsa World. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC officials, however, viewed Long's venture the latest twist  
in what they said is a growing list of fraudulent investment 
schemes using the Internet -- including share offerings in eel 
farms, coconut plantations, movie ventures and exploration of a 
near-Earth asteroid. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are making investment decisions based on what they read  
on a Web site -- and that is insane,'' Harold Degenhardt, the SEC's 
district administrator in Fort Worth, Texas, said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	According to New Utopia's Web site, which is more than 100 pages  
long, the new tax-free country will rise from the Caribbean about 
115 miles west of the Cayman Islands. Long pitched New Utopia 
government five-year bonds at 9.5 percent, inviting investors to 
become charter citizens of the island nation. He also claimed that 
currency investments in New Utopia would yield a return of as much 
as 200 percent, according to the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site received more than 100,000 visits, the SEC said.  
</P>
<P>
	Degenhardt said Long, as prince of the new country, put his face  
on pictures of its currency. He said Long, whose given name is 
Howard Turney, has lived in Houston and Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Long's age, Degenhardt replied, ``Who knows? He may have  
bubbled up from the sea like the Goddess Aphrodite.'' Then he 
disclosed it, 67.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index rose today  
for the fifth consecutive session. The dollar was higher against 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.96 yen at late afternoon, up 0.20 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 121.37 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 8.94 points,  
or 0.05 percent, closing the week at 16,855.63 points. On Thursday, 
the average climbed 292.19 points, or 1.77 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	With continued buying by foreign investors, market sentiment was  
rather bullish for much of today, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Selling to lock in profits ahead of the weekend set in during  
the afternoon after the market made strong gains in the morning 
session,'' said Yoshihiko Kuroichi, an analyst at the investment 
information division of Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was buoyed in the morning by heavy buying related to  
the special quotation cash settlement of April options contracts, 
pushing the Nikkei above 17,000 for the first time since March 30, 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was heavy, with an estimated 1.24 billion shares  
changing hands on the exchange's first section, up from Thursday's 
turnover of 826 million shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners 715 
to 501, with 116 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The market's early strength also derived from an overnight rally  
on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 112.39 
points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 10,197.70. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index was down 2.16 points, or  
0.16 percent, to 1,342.91. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar edged lower from its New York  
level late Thursday amid thin trading as players awaited the 
results of two events -- the Bank of Japan's policy-board meeting 
and a speech by the influential Japanese vice finance minister for 
international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara. 
</P>
<P>
	Although traders did not expect any change in the Bank of  
Japan's monetary policy, the market remained cautious after 
Thursday's cuts in European interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakakibara said in his speech that he would welcome less  
volatility in the foreign exchange market. 
</P>
<P>
	He also hinted that Japanese financial authorities would act to  
stop any surge in the value of the yen against the dollar that was 
not based on a change in the underlying economic conditions in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I and (international bureau head Haruhiko) Kuroda have  
repeatedly said, decisive action will be taken against a premature 
appreciation of the yen,'' Sakakibara said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 120.76 yen and 121.53 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 130.43 yen in late afternoon, up from  
130.40 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.610 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.600 percent, 
pushing its price down to 101.66 yen from 101.74 yen.

<HEADLINE> Teen Olympiad, Family End Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- After enormous success at a young age -- followed  
by a high-profile rift with her parents -- Olympic gold medalist 
Dominique Moceanu may have finally found peace. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old gymnast and her parents have reached a  
confidential financial settlement and ended a protective order 
against her father, the Houston Chronicle and The Dallas Morning 
News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an extremely difficult time for my family, and I  
hope that we can now begin to move forward in support of one 
another,'' Miss Moceanu said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that deep down my father loves me, and of course I love  
him, so I need to find a way in my heart to give him forgiveness. I 
hope there is a chance that someday things in my family can be 
normal again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, signed Thursday by Family Law Judge Patricia  
Lykos, was kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
	The family fight erupted publicly last October, when Miss  
Moceanu sued for her independence, saying her father, Dumitru 
Moceanu, had squandered the money she had earned in a 10-year 
professional career. She was declared a legal adult Oct. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Moceanu's parents placed her earnings in a trust fund,  
which they administer. She did not have access to the trust until 
she turned 35. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Eric Lindros Undergoes Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The doctor who removed a hardened blood clot  
from Eric Lindros' chest Friday predicted that the Philadelphia 
Flyers' captain would make a complete recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros underwent the 90-minute procedure after a setback in his  
recovery from a collapsed lung. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found exactly what we thought we would find,'' said Dr.  
Larry Kaiser, a chest surgeon who performed the surgery. ``We were 
able to totally remove it and his lung is now completely 
re-expanded. I think he'll find his breathing is significantly 
better, easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser removed a clot that was pressing against the lower lobe  
of Lindros' right lung, keeping it from fully expanding. The fluid 
in the lung was not infected. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure, called video thoroscopy, was minor, and Lindros  
was expected to be hospitalized 4-5 days at the University of 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, ``it's basically R and R,'' Kaiser said. ``I don't  
foresee any other procedures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The star center flew to Philadelphia from a hospital in  
Nashville, Tenn., Thursday expecting to come to the arena and meet 
with teammates before their game against Pittsburgh. Those plans 
were canceled after Lindros ran a fever above 102 degrees and 
doctors discovered the fluid buildup in his chest cavity. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors inserted a tube and a microscopic camera through two  
small incisions in Lindros' chest. The fluid and clotted blood was 
in the area between the lung and the diaphragm. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure will ``allow him to recover without any long-term  
effects at all,'' Kaiser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors don't know what caused about six pints of blood to seep  
into Lindros' chest after a 2-1 victory over the Nashville 
Predators April 1. Kaiser said the blood likely seeped from his 
lung, adding that he found no evidence that a blood vessel had 
ruptured. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros' setback dashed hopes that he would be ready for the  
playoffs. But his teammates aren't thinking about that right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not our main concern, getting Eric back is,'' said  
Lindros' linemate, John LeClair. ``Our main concern is getting Eric 
healthy.''

	NATO Keeps on Bombing  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO airstrikes pounded various  
targets in Yugoslavia on Orthodox Good Friday, a move a Cyprus 
envoy blamed for a Yugoslav decision not to free three captured 
U.S. servicemen. Western officials said bombings, now in their 
third week, are starting to take a toll on President Slobodan 
Milosevic's forces. But the failure of the mission by Cyprus' 
former president brought fears the conflict would intensify. NATO 
allies have insisted the airstrikes will continue until Milosevic 
withdraws troops sent to the Serb province of Kosovo as part of his 
14-month crackdown on the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army. 

</P>
<P>
	Russia To Stay Out of Conflict  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department annoucned it has received  
an assurance from Russia that it will not get involved militarily 
in Kosovo. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was told by 
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov that Russia was not retargeting NATO 
countries with missiles despite an ominous impression given by a 
Russian politician, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said. 
Meanwhile, U.S. defense officials are trying to verify ``disturbing 
reports'' that young Kosovar Albanian women had been herded into a 
Serb army training camp, where they were raped and up to 20 of them 
killed.

	Senators Urging Ground Troops  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Following a visit to NATO headquarters and  
American troops in Europe, nine lawmakers urged President Clinton 
today to drop his refusal to consider ground forces for the Kosovo 
conflict. In a letter signed by all but two of the 11 House and 
Senate members who made the visit, the lawmakers said even if the 
air campaign succeeds ``there is less certainty that NATO's broader 
objectives in Kosovo ... will be achieved.''

	Judge Orders McDougal Jury Probe  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The judge in Susan McDougal's trial  
froze jury deliberations today and ordered an FBI investigation of 
possible attempts to influence the jurors. This morning it was 
discovered that a juror had brought a state law book into the jury 
room. Mrs. McDougal was being tried on charges of criminal contempt 
and obstruction for her refusal to testify before grand juries 
investigating her Whitewater business partners, President Clinton 
and Hillary Rodham Clinton.

	Clinton Pushes Patients' Rights  
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- President Clinton portrayed Republicans as  
handmaidens of insurance and health-care companies today as 
Democrats launched a novel Internet petition drive to mobilize 
support for the ``patients' bill of rights.'' House and Senate 
Democrats staged rallies and speeches in 32 states to ask Americans 
to raise their voices by petition for new health-care rights. 
Republicans warned Democrats against partisan politics in the 
health-care reform process.

	U.S. Addresses a Palestinian State  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is assuring Israel  
that it is working hard to keep Yasser Arafat from declaring a 
Palestinian state next month. But that pledge prepared for Foreign 
Minister Ariel Sharon's one-day visit today was balanced by 
continuing U.S. determination to see Israel relinquish more 
territory to Arafat's Palestinian Authority. The Clinton 
administration insists Israel has no good reason not to resume the 
stalled troop withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton: Duty To Help Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Del. (AP) -- It is the nation's duty to  
help refugees displaced by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's 
campaign of ``ethnic cleansing,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said 
today, praising U.S. aid efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton told airmen at Dover Air Force Base their work  
transporting meals for tens of thousands of Kosovo Albanian 
refugees flooding into Albania and Macedonia has not gone 
unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
	While force is necessary to stop Milosevic's ``perverted view of  
what was a political strategy to keep himself and his allies in 
power,'' the first lady said, humanitarian efforts ``fulfill our 
values'' by trying to alleviate the suffering of thousands of poor 
and hungry refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``As blessed as we are in this country, there are countless  
people who don't share those blessings,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her visit to Dover Air Force Base came a week after workers at  
the base began preparing shipments of daily ration packets for 
transport to the Balkans. By the end of Saturday, the base will 
have moved about 500,000 meals. 
</P>
<P>
	Each meal -- in a yellow packet bearing the message, ``Food gift  
from the people of the United States of America'' -- contains enough 
food to sustain one person for a day, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to about 650 airmen gathered at a hangar, Mrs. Clinton  
urged Americans to donate food to the relief effort. The rations 
shipped so far were provided by the Department of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Mrs. Clinton met with personnel who help load the  
aircraft that carry the meals to Italy for distribution to refugee 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Felix Grieder, commander of the 436th Airlift Wing at the  
base, explained how the meals were packaged, as Mrs. Clinton 
inspected the metallic packets. 
</P>
<P>
	Technical Sgt. Robert Graber, who assisted Mrs. Clinton, said  
the first lady helped pack one of the boxes carrying 10 meals. 
After disentangling her shoe from some camouflage netting, she 
helped carry the 25-pound box to a pallet to be shipped to 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	She was joined on the visit by Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Rep.  
Michael Castle, R-Del.; and Delaware Gov. Thomas Carper, a 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Biden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Affairs  
Committee, spoke forcefully about the need to bomb Serb targets, 
suggesting that ground troops may eventually be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	He compared Milosevic's policies with those of Hitler's campaign  
against the Jews, predicting that once the mission is over, 
Americans will learn that thousands of ethnic Albanians have been 
executed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's happening again, now, in 1999,'' Biden said. ``These are  
not military casualties,'' he said of the refugees. ``These are 
innocent civilians. These are the victims of a man I think should 
be tried as a war criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The senator said the American mission in Yugoslavia is needed to  
protect ``the very security of Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J. Brian Atwood, administrator of the Agency for International  
Development, the group coordinating humanitarian relief to the 
refugees, echoed Biden's words. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the worst brutality that has occurred in Europe since  
Hitler,'' Atwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton thanked Biden for his comments, adding: ``What he  
said needs to be said over and over again.''

<HEADLINE> Libel Ruling vs. Dow Jones Tossed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge in Houston has ordered a new  
trial in a libel case against the publisher of The Wall Street 
Journal, setting aside a ruling that had ordered Dow Jones &AMP; Co. to 
pay $22.7 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ruling late Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Ewing  
Werlein said the plaintiff, a now-defunct securities firm in 
Houston, withheld important evidence in the trial that would have 
bolstered Dow Jones' defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Werlein found that the company, MMAR Group Inc., won its  
favorable verdict in 1997 ``through its own misconduct and 
misrepresentations'' by holding back tape recordings of MMAR 
officials that would have supported the claims made in the 1993 
Wall Street Journal story. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased with the court's decision, and are quite  
optimistic as this case returns to the District Court. We've long 
maintained that we did not cause MMAR's collapse, but merely 
chronicled it,'' said Paul Steiger, managing editor of the Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Morris, a lawyer for MMAR, said: ``We disagree with, but  
respect, Judge Werlein's ruling. We are confident that MMAR will 
ultimately prevail in a new trial or otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The original jury ruling in March 1997 brought a $222.7 million  
libel verdict against Dow Jones, a record amount that shocked the 
newspaper industry and free-press advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, Judge Werlein struck down the $200 million in  
punitive damages against Dow Jones, letting stand actual damages of 
$22.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In the original ruling, a seven-member jury decided that five  
sentences in a Journal article by Laura Jereski published Oct. 21, 
1993 were false and defamatory against MMAR. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for MMAR blamed the article for the investment firm's  
demise later that year. Dow Jones argued during the two-week trial 
that the firm collapsed for other reasons, and that the disputed 
sentences were accurate or substantially true. Among the article's 
contentions were that MMAR officials hid portfolio losses by 
mismarking documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Copies of the firm's tape recordings were held by a former MMAR  
employee who approached Dow Jones about them early last year. The 
employee was killed in a private plane crash in Belize last July, 
one week after his last meeting with Dow Jones attorneys, according 
to court documents.

<HEADLINE> Medical Marijuana Users Licensed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCATA, Calif. (AP) -- Arcata's police chief walked into the  
house and was escorted upstairs to a bedroom filled with marijuana 
plants and enough smokable pot to fill a grocery bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of reaching for his gun or a search warrant, Mel Brown  
offered a handshake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to leave places like that with plants and prisoners,''  
Brown said on the way out of Jason Browne's marijuana garden. ``But 
here, law enforcement is holding out the olive branch to people who 
smoke medical marijuana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tucked between groves of towering redwoods and misty coastal  
beaches in far northern California, Arcata, population 16,000, is 
getting considerable attention for its response to Proposition 215, 
the 1996 voter initiative that allows people to grow and use 
marijuana for medicinal purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown personally issues photo identification cards bearing his  
signature to people who register as medical marijuana patients, 
after confirming that they have a doctor's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he has issued about 100 of the ``stay out of jail''  
cards. Officers have been instructed not to arrest pot growers or 
smokers who carry the ID. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he is not concerned about trouble from Attorney  
General Janet Reno, who personally reminded state Attorney General 
Bill Lockyer last month that Proposition 215 runs counter to 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, I don't see Janet Reno coming to Arcata and  
arresting somebody or having her people arrest somebody,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a precaution, however, Brown keeps no record of who applies  
for an ID and doesn't keep track of those who currently use a card. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the card holders is Browne, who smokes pot to relieve his  
back pain and invited the chief to survey his crop. During the 
visit, the chief listened attentively while the grower spoke of the 
potency of his next harvest, and sighed sympathetically when Browne 
shook some stalks and unleashed a swarm of marijuana-munching bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jason and I were both very cautious when the program first  
started,'' said Brown, 53. ``I didn't want to be associated with 
black market drug dealers and he didn't want to be associated with 
someone who was going to stab him in the back. But time passed and 
we got over the stereotypes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the U.S. Justice Department won a court order to shut  
down most of the state's cannabis clubs for violating federal laws 
against marijuana distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockyer, who is seeking a compromise that will avoid the wrath  
of federal officials, has formed a task force of law enforcement 
officers and medical marijuana advocates to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``What makes Arcata's program work is the fact that law  
enforcement and the medical community are involved,'' said Nathan 
Barankin, Lockyer's spokesman. ``The task force has been asked to 
look at Arcata as a model and perhaps make some recommendations on 
whether what works for Arcata works for Los Angeles and other 
larger communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arcata works for officials in Mendocino County, where District  
Attorney Norman Vroman plans to announce a similar ID card system 
next month. ``We thought it was very successful and we intend to 
plagiarize as much of it as we can,'' Vroman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such praise from law enforcement is a dramatic change for the  
Emerald Triangle, the region in Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity 
counties where pot is the largest cash crop and drug-busting teams 
often raided clandestine marijuana patches hidden in the forests. 
</P>
<P>
	Pot is so common here that the pungent scent of marijuana smoke  
hovers outside bars, and locals practice the ``4:20'' toke time 
each afternoon, much as people take tea in England. (Smokers say 
4-20 also is police code for a marijuana offense.) 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who serves on Lockyer's task force, is proud of the  
official support, but says his program is simply a response to 
Arcata's needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chief concern was being able to afford the people in my  
community the rights they were given,'' he said. ``Secondly, the 
program doesn't waste the community's money on police work that 
would not lead to successful prosecutions.''

<HEADLINE> More Gasoline Price Hikes Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gasoline will likely cost about a dime a  
gallon more this summer than last because of rising crude oil 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Information Administration said Thursday the average  
price for regular, self-service gasoline will peak at $1.18 a 
gallon in May and average $1.13 a gallon over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The price jump was attributed to an expectation of a continuing  
upward track in crude oil prices because of recent agreement among 
world producers to reduce production. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices also have been affected, especially in California, by  
refinery problems. The average price for regular self-service 
gasoline in California peaked at $1.59 a gallon on April 5, which 
was 49 cents a gallon higher than a year ago, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency predicted that crude oil prices will continue to  
rise, with West Texas intermediate selling at $15.63 per 44-gallon 
barrel on Thursday moving to $18 by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline demand this summer is expected to increase by 2 percent  
over a year ago because of continued economic growth and prices, 
though higher than last year, still moderate by historic standards, 
the agency said. Still, gasoline stocks were high, especially in 
the East, with no supply problems anticipated. 
</P>

	The Energy Information Administration is the statistical arm of  
the Energy Department.

<HEADLINE> Storms Sweep Across Midwest, Plains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Powerful storms swept across the Midwest and Plains, destroying  
homes and buildings in several states as it moved eastward early 
today. At least two people were killed in Illinois, and heavy 
damage was reported near Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of emergency vehicles converged on Ashland, Ill., a  
community of 1,200 people northwest of Springfield, after winds 
ripped into a trailer park with 60 to 70 homes late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	State police spokesman Mark McDonald said one person was killed,  
an elderly woman who was pulled from the debris that was once her 
home. Other residents were treated at area hospitals for cuts and 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just walked outside and just seen trailers tipping  
everywhere,'' said Lori Krenshaw, a resident of South Trailer Park 
in Ashland. ``It was a mess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Cisco, 65 miles east of Ashland, a woman was killed and three  
other people were injured when high winds destroyed a farm house, 
Fire Chief Ron Weishaar said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the violent system moved eastward, wind gusts up to 70 mph  
were reported in central Indiana early today. Eight to 10 houses 
were damaged in and around Dillsboro, Ind., but there were no 
injuries, said Bill Black Jr., deputy director of Dearborn County 
Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the line in Ohio, police closed Interstate 71 on the  
northern edge of Cincinnati because of numerous accidents and 
debris. In Montgomery, northeast of Cincinnati, police Chief Don 
McGlothlin said 20 to 25 single-family homes were destroyed by the 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Cross set up an aid station at a junior high school, and  
police were going door-to-door checking on people. At least 12 
people went to hospitals for treatment of cuts and bruises. There 
were no reports of deaths, said Terry Daly, administrative aide in 
the Hamilton County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the hardest hit states was Iowa, where at least nine  
suspected tornadoes destroyed homes, downed barns and uprooted 
trees. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Deb Frisbie, who lives on a farm southeast of Adair, surveyed  
the damage to her home. Trees littered her yard, and a hay baler 
and other farm equipment were overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Frisbie said she saw ``just black coming at us.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We barely made it to the basement,'' she said. ``We didn't  
really hear anything. All I was worried about was getting everybody 
to the basement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado struck a five-block area in the eastern Nebraska town  
Thursday afternoon, damaging 14 homes and leveling one that was 
under construction. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Helga Garay's car was smashed by tree limbs outside her  
residence in Morse Bluff, south of North Bend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's a convertible,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The storm also damaged buildings and downed power lines in  
Missouri. One death was blamed on the storm, the result of a crash 
on a rain-slick highway. 
</P>
<P>
	A barn owned by Harlen and Margaret Linville in Barnard, in  
northwest Missouri, was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was napping,'' Mrs. Linville said. ``When I roused, the barn  
was gone, debris was still flying.''

<HEADLINE> Braves Send Wohlers to the Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Mark Wohlers is headed to the minors again.  
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, who dominated NL hitters for three years as one of the  
top closers in the league and then lost his control last season, 
was designated for assignment Friday after flopping in his first 
two appearances of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Braves manager Bobby Cox said Wohlers probably will report to  
Triple-A Richmond within four days. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he thought he was going to accept it,'' Braves general  
manager John Schuerholz said. ``He has not informed us of his 
acceptance, but we anticipate that he will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers could reject the assignment and opt to become a free  
agent, but he would give up his $5.2 million salary this season and 
an $800,000 buyout of Atlanta's $5.5 million option for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta purchased the contract of right-hander Joe Winkelsas  
from Double-A Greenville. The 23-year-old was 6-9 with a 2.22 ERA 
at Class-A Danville last season with 22 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it was necessary to make this adjustment to our pitching  
roster at this time, we still remain very hopeful that Mark will be 
able to return to his high level of abilities,'' Braves general 
manager John Schuerholz said. ``We support and encourage his 
efforts in this regard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, 29, was unavailable for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old right-hander walked four Monday and gave up two  
runs in two-thirds of an inning in a season-opening 7-4 loss to 
Philadelphia. He faced three batters in Thursday night's 6-3 loss 
to the Phillies, walking two on four consecutive pitches each and 
throwing a sacrifice bunt wildly over first baseman Ryan Klesko's 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	``His last few outings were not good and it just got kind of  
worse,'' Cox said. ``We talked to him this afternoon and he 
understood completely what we were doing, what should be done. He's 
really anxious to get it going down there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After struggling in the early weeks of spring training, Wohlers  
appeared to find his form as the season neared. He retired the 
Cleveland Indians 1-2-3 in the final exhibition game to earn his 
second save of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's there. We saw it for a month in spring training. He  
looked great,'' Cox said, shaking his head. ``If I knew, I'd get 
half his salary because he'd give it to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers saved 97 games for the Braves from 1995-97 but couldn't  
find the plate last season. He had a 10.18 ERA for the Braves, 
walking 33 in 20 1-3 innings, and was even worse after going back 
to Triple-A Richmond. He had 36 walks in 12 1-3 innings and a 20.43 
ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves are desperately seeking a closer now that Kerry  
Ligtenberg, who saved 30 games last year as a rookie, is out for 
the season because of a torn elbow ligament. John Rocker appears to 
be the logical candidate. He hasn't given up a run in 1 1-3 innings 
in two appearances this season and didn't allow a run in 12 spring 
innings.

<HEADLINE> Chemotherapy, Exhaustion Explored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They say they are ``bone-tired,'' so fatigued  
their arms and legs feel heavy. Simple things like taking a shower, 
even eating a full meal, are exhausting. 
</P>
<P>
	Most cancer patients will feel this extreme fatigue for weeks or  
months. This feeling is considered the No. 1 side effect of cancer 
and largely is caused by the chemotherapy or radiation necessary to 
fight the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet few patients seek or receive treatment for fatigue, a lapse  
cancer specialists now are trying to remedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like an iceberg sitting there underneath the surface.  
It's a lot bigger problem than people seem to appreciate,'' said 
Dr. Tejpal Grover of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The Houston 
center just opened a comprehensive fatigue clinic to uncover what 
causes each patient's exhaustion and help them fight back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want patients to say, 'Gosh maybe there's something that  
could be done, and I need to talk to my doctor about that,''' said 
Chicago nurse Marnie McHale of the Oncology Nurses Society, which 
this week started a campaign to educate patients and their 
caregivers about cancer fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Fatigue long was discounted as a serious problem and only now is  
being researched aggressively. Studies suggest that over 75 percent 
of cancer patients suffer serious fatigue. It limits their ability 
to work, attend school or perform daily activities. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a mental toll -- ``chemo brain'' some call it -- where  
patients cannot concentrate, are forgetful or depressed. It even 
can hinder rigorous cancer therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet a recent survey of 379 cancer patients found only 9 percent  
of those who suffered fatigue were treated with prescription drugs 
or blood transfusions. While medication is not always appropriate, 
experts say that number should be higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem is dispelling the myths that there is no  
help for fatigue, or that fatigue only could mean the cancer is 
worsening so patients are scared to mention it, says the Oncology 
Nursing Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients and doctors also may not communicate well.  
</P>
<P>
	Patients have different degrees of fatigue, caused by different  
problems that require customized, comprehensive care that 
oncologists may be too busy battling the tumor to offer, Grover 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Anemia is a leading culprit, because radiation and many powerful  
chemotherapy drugs that kill cancer cells also kill blood and 
bone-marrow cells. Medicines, such as Epogen or Procrit, that boost 
blood-cell production or blood transfusions may help. 
</P>
<P>
	Undertreated pain is another big cause, limiting patients'  
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	Some new studies suggest mild exercise programs help, because  
constant rest actually makes patients quickly lose muscle strength, 
thus worsening fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	At M.D. Anderson's fatigue clinic, doctors are finding patients  
who were so busy fighting cancer that nobody noticed they also have 
thyroid problems or other energy-sapping diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Tumors can compete for a body's nutrients at the same time that  
chemotherapy-caused nausea depletes calories and spurs dehydration. 
There are medicines to minimize nausea, and nutritionists may 
suggest easier-to-tolerate, high-nutrient meals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes help can be creative: Put a seat in the shower or a  
rolling stool in the kitchen to conserve energy. 
</P>
<P>
	There are not solutions for all patients and doctors do not  
fully understand cancer fatigue. That is frustrating to patients, 
as is finishing treatment and still being fatigued. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Cancer Institute notes that some cancer survivors  
can take years to regain energy. Still, ``patients put high 
expectations on themselves'' to get back to normal, and may lose 
family support once treatment ends, McHale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new campaign, oncology nurses are educating patients  
and caregivers about fatigue, helping them plan ways to conserve 
energy and cope with cancer treatment and urging them to seek 
medical care when fatigue strikes. For more information, nurses 
will answer e-mailed questions at www.cancerfatigue.org.

<HEADLINE> O'Meara Still Has Masters Magic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Mark O'Meara let Tiger Woods and David Duval  
have the gallery in the first round of the Masters. All O'Meara did 
was produce the same kind of magic that won him the green jacket in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day Augusta National was allowing no liberties to be taken  
with its par 72, O'Meara birdied the 18th hole just like he did 
last year to win the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	His 70 positioned O'Meara comfortably a shot behind three others  
with a few rounds to be completed early today because of bad 
weather Thursday. He was tied with six others. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara said he had a special feeling again standing over a  
birdie putt on the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, O'Meara holed a 20-foot birdie putt on the last hole  
to win his first green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, it was an 8-footer as he concluded a round that took  
6 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't quite as nervous today as I was last year,'' O'Meara  
said. ``But I felt good over the putt like I did last year. It 
brought back memories knowing I could do it when I had to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good way to end what turned out to be a long, hard  
day. It was nice to get off to a good start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not many fans followed O'Meara even though he was the defending  
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara was ``third-fiddle'' behind Duval and Woods in the first  
round. 
</P>
<P>
	He had about 150 faithful followers. Most fans trooped after  
Duval, the No. 1 player in the world, and Woods, ranked No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara survived the day in his typical grinding style to prove  
once again it's foolish to overlook the man who won the Masters and 
British Open in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was a difficult day to stay focused.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleased with my composure, the way I hung in there,''  
O'Meara said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara's group didn't tee off until 1:12 p.m., and because  
officials decided to play threesomes the afternoon dragged along. 
</P>
<P>
	It took O'Meara's group of amateur Hank Kuehne and Lee Westwood  
one hour to play three holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Then O'Meara hooked a tee shot on the par-3, No. 4 after the  
long delay and made bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just had to realize it was going to be one of those kind  
of days where you had to survive it,'' O'Meara said. ``I hit some 
good shots. I hit some bad shots. But I putted pretty well and that 
kept me going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the way to another clutch finish on the 18th green.

<HEADLINE> Springsteen Kicks Off World Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Reunited with his old band, Bruce  
Springsteen opened his world tour today to a sold-out crowd of 
20,000 in Barcelona's Saint George Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boss did not disappoint in his first tour with the E Street  
Band in more than a decade. They opened with ``My Love Will Not Let 
You Down'' and ``Prove It All Night.'' And that's what they did, 
captivating the crowd for 2 1/2 hours through 19 songs and five 
encores. 
</P>
<P>
	After delighting the Barcelona fans with a greeting spoken in  
Catalan, Springsteen hardly addressed his audience during the 
following high-energy performance bursting with old favorites 
including ``Badlands,'' ``10th Avenue Freezeout'' and ``The 
River.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another highlight was a beautiful duet, ``Mansion on the Hill,''  
sung with his wife, Patti Scialfa, who also played guitar and sang 
backing vocals throughout the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's concert, and a second date Sunday also in this  
northeastern Spanish city, mark the beginning of a 17-city European 
tour for Springsteen and the E Street Band. Dates include Munich, 
Zurich, London, Dublin and Paris before the leg wraps up in Madrid. 
The first U.S. dates don't come until mid-July.

<HEADLINE> Medical Marijuana Users Licensed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCATA, Calif. (AP) -- Arcata's police chief walked into the  
house and was escorted upstairs to a bedroom filled with marijuana 
plants and enough smokable pot to fill a grocery bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of reaching for his gun or a search warrant, Mel Brown  
offered a handshake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to leave places like that with plants and prisoners,''  
Brown said on the way out of Jason Browne's marijuana garden. ``But 
here, law enforcement is holding out the olive branch to people who 
smoke medical marijuana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tucked between groves of towering redwoods and misty coastal  
beaches in far northern California, Arcata, population 16,000, is 
getting considerable attention for its response to Proposition 215, 
the 1996 voter initiative that allows people to grow and use 
marijuana for medicinal purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown personally issues photo identification cards bearing his  
signature to people who register as medical marijuana patients, 
after confirming that they have a doctor's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he has issued about 100 of the ``stay out of jail''  
cards. Officers have been instructed not to arrest pot growers or 
smokers who carry the ID. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he is not concerned about trouble from Attorney  
General Janet Reno, who personally reminded state Attorney General 
Bill Lockyer last month that Proposition 215 runs counter to 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, I don't see Janet Reno coming to Arcata and  
arresting somebody or having her people arrest somebody,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a precaution, however, Brown keeps no record of who applies  
for an ID and doesn't keep track of those who currently use a card. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the card holders is Browne, who smokes pot to relieve his  
back pain and invited the chief to survey his crop. During the 
visit, the chief listened attentively while the grower spoke of the 
potency of his next harvest, and sighed sympathetically when Browne 
shook some stalks and unleashed a swarm of marijuana-munching bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jason and I were both very cautious when the program first  
started,'' said Brown, 53. ``I didn't want to be associated with 
black market drug dealers and he didn't want to be associated with 
someone who was going to stab him in the back. But time passed and 
we got over the stereotypes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the U.S. Justice Department won a court order to shut  
down most of the state's cannabis clubs for violating federal laws 
against marijuana distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockyer, who is seeking a compromise that will avoid the wrath  
of federal officials, has formed a task force of law enforcement 
officers and medical marijuana advocates to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``What makes Arcata's program work is the fact that law  
enforcement and the medical community are involved,'' said Nathan 
Barankin, Lockyer's spokesman. ``The task force has been asked to 
look at Arcata as a model and perhaps make some recommendations on 
whether what works for Arcata works for Los Angeles and other 
larger communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arcata works for officials in Mendocino County, where District  
Attorney Norman Vroman plans to announce a similar ID card system 
next month. ``We thought it was very successful and we intend to 
plagiarize as much of it as we can,'' Vroman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such praise from law enforcement is a dramatic change for the  
Emerald Triangle, the region in Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity 
counties where pot is the largest cash crop and drug-busting teams 
often raided clandestine marijuana patches hidden in the forests. 
</P>
<P>
	Pot is so common here that the pungent scent of marijuana smoke  
hovers outside bars, and locals practice the ``4:20'' toke time 
each afternoon, much as people take tea in England. (Smokers say 
4-20 also is police code for a marijuana offense.) 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who serves on Lockyer's task force, is proud of the  
official support, but says his program is simply a response to 
Arcata's needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chief concern was being able to afford the people in my  
community the rights they were given,'' he said. ``Secondly, the 
program doesn't waste the community's money on police work that 
would not lead to successful prosecutions.''

<HEADLINE> Angles Put Vaughn on 15-Day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Mo Vaughn won't be helping the Anaheim  
Angels anytime soon after going on the 15-day disabled list with a 
sprained left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn, the $80 million free agent, went on the DL during  
Thursday night's game against Cleveland, which beat the Angels 9-1. 
He was injured when he fell into the Indians' dugout chasing a foul 
pop in Tuesday's opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some sprains like this can take up to six weeks to heal,''  
team physician Dr. Lewis Yocum said. ``Hopefully, he'll be back in 
two weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn didn't need crutches, but he hobbled around the clubhouse  
in an air cast. He went on the DL for only the second time in his 
nine-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to need a little more time than everyone expected,''  
he said. ``I feel better, but I'm not ready to put any more 
pressure on it. If I'm not going to be right, I don't want it to be 
aggravated for the rest of the season ... it's disheartening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman Chris Pritchett was recalled from Triple-A  
Vancouver to take Vaughn's spot on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn hit .337 with 40 home runs and 115 RBIs for Boston last  
season, then signed a six-year contract with Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels, with a long history of injuries to key players, now  
have Vaughn, center fielder Jim Edmonds and shortstop Gary 
DiSarcina on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels began a four-game series against AL West rival Texas  
on Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Maggert, Faldo Fail To Make Cut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Six weeks ago, Jeff Maggert walked off the  
golf course and picked up a check for $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Maggert staggered away from the 18th hole at Augusta  
National Golf Club, made do with a payday of $5,000 and headed home 
for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Texan, who won the Match Play championship in  
February, was among those missing the cut at the Masters, along 
with three-time champion Nick Faldo and two-time winners Ben 
Crenshaw, Seve Ballesteros and Tom Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggert shot a 6-under-par 78 in the first round, then added a  
76 on Friday to finish with a 10-over 154, missing the cut by six 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of the four majors, this is the toughest one for me,'' said  
Maggert, who hasn't finished higher than 37th since his surprise 
victory in the Match Play Championship. ``It's a tough course. 
Maybe I haven't played it enough yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has cracked the top 20 only once in seven trips to the  
Masters -- tying for seventh in 1996 -- and missed the cut three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like someday I'm going to have a good tournament  
here,'' Maggert said. ``I just have to stay patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already assured of a banner year, Maggert would prefer that it  
be remembered for more than just his Match Play victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's over and done with,'' he said. ``I've got to get out of  
here and play some good golf. That's what I'll try to do in the 
next few weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo hasn't played very well since the 1996 Masters, when he  
rallied from a six-stroke deficit in the final round for a 
memorable victory over Greg Norman. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Englishman has now missed the cut three years in  
a row at Augusta National, raising doubts he will ever regain the 
swing that made him one of the world's most dominant players. He 
was doomed by an 8-over 80 in the first round, finishing 9-over 
after a 73 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a fine line at the moment,'' said Faldo, whose 80 was his  
second-worst round in 16 trips to the Masters. ``I've had a million 
blows this year, and this is just another one to overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The affable Crenshaw, whose victory in the 1995 Masters was  
among the tournament's most emotional moments, couldn't bear to 
talk with reporters after another disastrous trip to Augusta. He 
has missed the cut three of the last four years, shooting a 79 on 
Friday to finish at 153. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too painful,'' Crenshaw said, before hurrying away to  
brood in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballesteros, playing on his 42nd birthday, didn't seem all that  
bothered after missing the cut for the third year in a row. At 
least he was consistent, knocked out by consecutive rounds of 78. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just enjoying myself and trying to play well,'' said  
Ballesteros, the Masters champion in 1980 and '83. ``It's always 
nice to be here. That's a positive thing, especially since I have 
won before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson appeared in good shape, sitting at 2-over with just four  
holes to play. But his game began to fall apart at 15, when he 
chipped from behind the green into the water along the front, 
leading to a bogey. At the par-3 16th, his tee shot landed in the 
front bunker, and he was still there after his next shot. Finally 
on the green in three, Watson two-putted for a double-bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Watson put his tee shot into the pine trees at 18, then  
three-putted for another double-bogey to finish with a 7-over 151. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough finish,'' Watson said. ``I played pretty well  
other than the last four holes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four amateurs -- Sergio Garcia (147), Tom McKnight (147), Matt  
Kuchar (148) and Trevor Immelman (148) -- made the cut, the most to 
reach the weekend since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar, the sensation of the 1998 tournament, came to Augusta  
battling the flu and shot a 77 in the first round. But he felt 
better Friday and came through with a 71, highlighted by a 4-under, 
three-hole stretch on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar sandwiched two birdies around an eagle at the par-5 13th,  
when he holed out from a bunker. The Georgia Tech junior bogeyed 
the final two holes but still managed to make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-three-year-old Gary Player, a three-time Masters champion,  
couldn't duplicate his performance a year ago, when he became the 
oldest player to make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The South African had two straight rounds of 79 to finish  
14-over, but he managed to thrill the fans at 18 when his 60-foot 
putt snaked down the hilly green to within a foot of the hole, 
allowing him to tap out for par. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always a thrill to come here,'' Player said.

<HEADLINE> Dresdner Bank Reports Profit Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Dresdner Bank, Germany's third-largest  
bank, said Friday its net profit rose 55 percent last year because 
of a sharp decline in the bank's tax burden. 
</P>
<P>
	Net earnings rose to $1.03 billion (1.86 billion marks) in 1998,  
but Dresdner didn't give a comparison to 1997 because it was 
reporting its annual figures under international accounting 
standards for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank said its capital gains taxes were at $421 million in  
1998, down 53 percent from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Dresdner credited the lower tax burden to ``extraordinary tax  
effects in the years 1997 and 1998'' and the conversion to 
international accounting standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Dresdner gave a different indication of its 1998  
performance in announcing a 7-percent decline in pretax profit to 
$1.44 billion.

<HEADLINE> NASD Regulation Issues Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the latest warning prompted by recent wild  
market swings, the brokers' group that operates the Nasdaq Stock 
Market on Thursday issued guidance to investors about buying stocks 
with borrowed money. 
</P>
<P>
	The risks of the practice, known as buying on margin, have  
increased in tandem with the recent volatility of the markets, said 
NASD Regulation, the self-policing arm of the National Association 
of Securities Dealers. The group posted the guidance, including 
facts about and risks of margin transactions, on its Web site at 
www.nasdr.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors buy securities on margin by borrowing part of the  
purchase price from their brokerage firm and putting up the 
securities as collateral for the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	As online trading has mushroomed and greater numbers of ordinary  
investors have taken up the risky practice of day trading in 
volatile markets, the use of margin has caused increasing concern 
among regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The new guidance includes information on the use of margin,  
margin requirements, margin account agreements and other topics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important for investors to understand that, even though  
margin enables them to leverage their securities to increase 
(purchasing) power, it is a financial tool that does have risk,'' 
Mary Schapiro, president of NASD Regulation, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Especially during volatile market conditions, investors need  
to be aware that if the value of securities in a margin account 
declines, they can lose more than the funds, or securities, they 
deposit in the account,'' Ms. Schapiro added. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, NASD Regulation warned investors they may lose money  
from delays in executing trades, online or through a broker, when 
the electronic Nasdaq market is swinging wildly and overburdened 
with trading volume. 
</P>
<P>
	And last month, the NASD's board of governors began considering  
a proposal requiring day-trading firms to screen investors and warn 
them of the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronic day-trading firms sell training courses and special  
software programs to ordinary investors who want to try the 
lightning-speed practice of day trading, exploiting small price 
movements in stocks to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, warned investors to be very wary of buying securities 
on margin.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Close Week Up / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Despite afternoon profit-taking, the Tokyo Stock  
Exchange's main index managed to rise today for the fifth 
consecutive day. The dollar was higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.96 yen at late afternoon, up 0.20 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 121.37 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 8.94 points,  
or 0.05 percent, closing the week at 16,855.63 points. On Thursday, 
the average climbed 292.19 points, or 1.77 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	With continued buying by foreign investors, market sentiment was  
rather bullish for much of today, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Selling to lock in profits ahead of the weekend set in during  
the afternoon after the market made strong gains in the morning 
session,'' said Yoshihiko Kuroichi, an analyst at the investment 
information division of Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was buoyed up in the morning by heavy buying related  
to the special quotation cash settlement of April options 
contracts, pushing the Nikkei above 17,000 for the first time since 
March 30, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was heavy, with an estimated 1.24 billion shares  
changing hands on the exchange's first section, up from Thursday's 
turnover of 826 million shares. Advancers outnumbered retreaters 
715 to 501, with 116 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The market's early strength also derived from an overnight rally  
on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 112.39 
points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,197.70 at Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 2.16 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,342.91. 
The TOPIX closed up 20.43 points, or 1.54 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar edged lower from its New York  
level late Thursday amid thin trading as players were waiting for 
the results of two events today -- the Bank of Japan's policy-board 
meeting and a speech by the influential Japanese vice finance 
minister for international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara. 
</P>
<P>
	Although traders did not expect any change in the Bank of  
Japan's monetary policy, the market remained cautious after 
Thursday's cuts in European interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Market players refrained from any significant activity prior to  
Sakakibara's speech at a seminar scheduled to start at 6:00 p.m. 
(0900 GMT). 
</P>
<P>
	The European Central Bank cut key interest rates by one-half a  
percentage point to 2.5 percent to stimulate economic activity 
among the 11 nations that adopted the euro earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower interest rates tend to spur lending and spending in a  
sluggish or recessionary economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 120.76 yen and 121.53 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 130.43 yen in late afternoon, up from  
130.40 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.610 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.600 percent, 
pushing its price down to 101.66 yen from 101.74 yen.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accused Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic today of presenting an ``illusion of partial 
compliance'' with NATO demands in Kosovo by declaring a cease-fire 
after violently chasing nearly 1 million ethnic Albanians from the 
province. The president said the ethnic cleansing won't stand and 
NATO airstrikes will continue. ``He hopes we will accept as

reject their share of a $150 million settlement with the Marcos 
family, their lawyer said Friday. Former Senate President Jovito 
Salonga said the families made their decision after a U.S. judge 
refused to delete a clause that said Marcos' widow, Imelda, and 
their children have never been charged with human rights 
violations. The proposed settlement would give $150 million to 
9,539 people who were tortured or lost relatives during Marcos'

<HEADLINE> Peterson Won't Go to SW Missouri St. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOONE, N.C. (AP) -- Buzz Peterson changed his mind today about  
becoming Southwest Missouri State's basketball coach and will 
remain at Appalachian State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was flattered by the interest shown by Southwest Missouri  
State,'' Peterson said. ``It is an outstanding school with an 
excellent basketball program, but I went with my gut feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Appalachian is where I am happy, and that's key for me and my  
family. We have higher goals to reach here, and I'm looking forward 
to achieving those goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Southwest Missouri State athletic director Bill  
Rowe said Peterson decided to take the job. Peterson said he had 
been offered a four- to five-year contract at $250,000 to $300,000 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	He changed his mind less than 12 hours later, Southwest Missouri  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very disappointed in the decision by coach Buzz  
Peterson not to become the next SMS head basketball coach after he 
told us he was going to take the job,'' Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson would have succeeded Steve Alford, who left Southwest  
Missouri State for Iowa to replace Tom Davis after taking the Bears 
to the round of 16 this season. Alford was 78-48 in four seasons 
with Southwest Missouri State. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been a disservice to Southwest Missouri State  
not to have my heart completely into the situation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson, 35, is 56-30 in three seasons at Appalachian State,  
leading the team to 20-victory seasons the past two. He was 
approached this spring about coaching openings at Saint Louis, 
Vanderbilt and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson played for four years at North Carolina and was a  
teammate of Michael Jordan's when the Tar Heels won the NCAA 
championship in 1982. He was an assistant at Vanderbilt (1993-96) 
before taking over at Appalachian State. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Appalachian State team was 21-8 and reached the  
Southern Conference championship game before losing to the College 
of Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have higher goals to reach in the future,'' Appalachian  
State athletic director Roachel Laney said. ``The athletics 
department looks forward to working with Buzz and his staff to help 
the players and the program reach these goals.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Missile-Warning Probe Blasts Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- An Air Force rocket blasted into  
space today carrying a missile-warning satellite for the Defense 
Department following an eight-month grounding of the Titan fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time a Titan IV rocket flew last August, it exploded 41  
seconds after liftoff in a $1 billion-plus disaster blamed on an 
electrical problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's launch was delayed 1 1/2 hours because the team fell behind  
in its work at the pad. The rocket soared into a clear sky at 1:01 
p.m. on its approximately $700 million mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titan IV-B -- the Air Force's largest rocket -- hoisted a  
Defense Support Program satellite capable of detecting missile and 
rocket launches as well as nuclear detonations. It's essentially a 
highly sensitive 2 1/2-ton infrared telescope that can discern forest 
fires, active volcanoes and even meteorites from a 22,000-mile-high 
orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Support Program satellites were instrumental in  
tracking Scud missiles during the 1991 Persian Gulf war. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Craig Lowery, chief of the warning operations branch at  
the Air Force Space Command, said the new satellite will not be 
rushed into service because of the conflict in Yugoslavia. It 
should be operational in the usual three to six months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowery refused to say where the satellite would be positioned  
over the Earth, noting that information was classified. He also 
would not say how many DSP satellites are functioning in orbit, but 
stressed their coverage was complete and worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our eyes never blink,'' Lowery said.  
</P>
<P>
	This was only the fourth flight of the Titan IV-B, a 20-story, 2  
million-pound monster that debuted in 1997. It's built by Lockheed 
Martin Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	After the explosion last August, the Air Force spent more than  
$45 million to investigate and concluded the accident was caused by 
electrical shorts in the rocket wiring. It was never determined 
whether the wire damage occurred during manufacturing, shipment or 
launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety percent of the wreckage was pulled from the Atlantic and  
helped investigators pinpoint the cause and make design changes, 
said Col. Jeffery Norton, director of launch programs for the Air 
Force Space and Missile Systems Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have inspected these particular systems probably more than  
any ship that we've ever flown,'' Norton said. ``For obvious 
reasons, we wanted to make sure that every rock that was there was 
turned over.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Copters Head for Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEIDELBERG, Germany (AP) -- The U.S. Army has begun deploying  
equipment to support the use of Apache helicopters in NATO 
airstrikes on Yugoslav forces in Kosovo, U.S. Army European 
headquarters said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Jim Boyle declined to say when the deployment began or  
what equipment and personnel had been delivered to Albania, which 
borders Yugoslavia's Kosovo province. 
</P>
<P>
	The deployment will include 24 Apache helicopters, two dozen  
support helicopters, multiple-rocket launchers as well as M-1A1 
Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The low-flying Apaches will intensify the air campaign by  
bringing the allied forces closer to Yugoslav ground forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The helicopters are being deployed from the 11th Aviation  
Regiment based in the Bavarian town of Illesheim.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Cop Indicted on Drug Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A policeman has been indicted on charges he took  
part in the drug trade he was hired to fight, distributing cocaine, 
supplying guns, taking protection money and identifying undercover 
officers to gang members. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal indictment Thursday charged Joseph Miedzianowski,  
46, and 11 alleged gang members and drug dealers with conspiracy to 
possess and distribute more than 200 pounds of cocaine and 
unspecified amounts of heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	It also accused Miedzianowski, a police gang specialist, of  
offering protection to a Miami-to-Chicago drug ring for as much as 
$12,000 a month. Miedzianowski began working with the ring in 1995 
and within a year took over its Chicago operations, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miedzianowski allegedly worked with four street gangs and  
provided security to the drug ring by identifying undercover 
officers, describing undercover police vehicles and revealing the 
names of informants. 
</P>
<P>
	He also supplied the ring with guns and ammunition and mediated  
disputes over drug prices and debts, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has alleged Miedzianowski sold crack, often by the  
duffel bag, in a church parking lot, at a grocery store and behind 
the station house where he worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Miedzianowski, who joined the department in 1976, has been in  
jail since his arrest in December. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Phillip A. Turner, said Miedzianowski is innocent  
and has a ``completely clean record.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Picks Baker, Perez de Cuellar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Howard Baker and Javier Perez de Cuellar were  
placed on a panel Friday that will police the conduct of 
International Olympic Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Baker, a former Senate majority leader and White  
House chief of staff, and Perez de Cuellar, the United Nations 
secretary-general for 10 years, were among the eight members 
appointed to its Ethics Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel was created last month in the wake of the Salt Lake  
City bribery scandal, in which six IOC members were expelled and 
four resigned for receiving improper inducements during the Utah 
capital's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee has also set up a separate reform panel, IOC 2000,  
to recommend ways of restructuring the organization. Former 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Peter Ueberroth, chief 
organizer of the 1984 Los Angeles Games, are among those already 
appointed to that panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics commission will be chaired by IOC vice president Keba  
Mbaye of Senegal, former vice president of the International Court 
of Justice in the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The other members announced Friday were French Senator Robert  
Badinter, former president of the French Constitution Court; former 
Swiss President Kurt Furgler; former Canadian Olympic athlete 
Charmaine Crooks; and IOC executive board members Kevan Gosper of 
Australia and Chiharu Igaya of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The individuals selected for the ethics commission are known  
for their independence and strong ethics,'' IOC president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch said. ``I am confident that the world of the 
commission will help the IOC adopt global best practice as we enter 
the new millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice president from Los Angeles and a  
member of the reform commission, said appointees such as Kissinger 
and de Cuellar ``are important and help let the athletes know that 
we are serious in our actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she was especially pleased with Baker's choice.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's the man,'' DeFrantz said at a U.S. Olympic Committee  
meeting in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointments of Baker and Perez de Cuellar should lend  
weight to the IOC's efforts to repair its credibility following the 
biggest scandal in its 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, 74, a Tennessee Republican, was in the U.S. Senate from  
1967-85 and was Senate majority leader, and was White House chief 
of staff under President Reagan in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez de Cuellar, 79, was U.N. chief from 1982 to 1991.  
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said the ethics panel will provide ``guidance on how the  
IOC operates in accordance with the best practices of international 
governance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said the panel would develop a framework of ethical  
principles and rules, study the Olympic bidding and selection 
process, ensure accountability and enforce compliance with a new 
code of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, which will meet at least twice a year and report  
to the IOC executive board, will hold its first meeting on May 3 at 
IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the composition of the IOC 2000 reform panel is not  
yet complete. The panel will have 20 to 24 members, half from the 
IOC and half from outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from Kissinger, Ueberroth and DeFrantz, others appointed  
to that commission so far include U.S. Olympic Committee president 
Bill Hybl and Italian industrialist Giovanni Agnelli. 
</P>
<P>
	The other panel members are expected to be announced in the next  
few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform committee will consider how IOC members are elected,  
term limits, structure and membership of the executive board, 
further roles for Olympic athletes, revenue sharing and the 
evolution of the games themselves.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Decries Ethnic Cleansing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accused Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic today of presenting an ``illusion of partial 
compliance'' with NATO demands in Kosovo by declaring a cease-fire 
after violently chasing nearly 1 million ethnic Albanians from the 
province. Clinton said the ethnic rout won't stand and NATO 
airstrikes will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hopes we will accept as permanent the results of his ethnic  
cleansing. We will not,'' Clinton said. ``What we have from Mr. 
Milosevic is not even partial compliance, but the illusion of 
partial compliance. We and our allies have properly rejected it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, speaking at the White House, didn't mention a Cypriot  
leader's mission today in Belgrade to try and obtain the release of 
three U.S. soldiers from the Yugoslav government. Hopes appeared to 
be dim today after Serb officials suggested the POWs may be held 
until NATO airstrikes stop -- a move the Pentagon and NATO have 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic called a unilateral cease-fire earlier this week in  
honor of the Orthodox Easter holiday, claiming his troops would 
halt fighting ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clinton administration and NATO dismissed it as  
meaningless and pledged to intensify airstrikes to cripple the 
ability of Serb army, police and paramilitary troops to kill 
Kosovar Albanians and keep them from returning to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said that during the past several days of good  
weather, NATO airstrikes have ``struck hard at the Serb machinery 
of repression and at the infrastructure that supports it,'' 
including fuel and arms depots and armored military vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is determined to persist and prevail,'' Clinton said,  
repeating a refrain he has used time and again since airstrikes 
began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	He accused Milosevic of trying to ``rearrange the facts on the  
ground'' through ethnic cleansing, then by calling a cease-fire. 
But Clinton said the Serbs are continuing to attack ethnic 
Albanians and are now preventing them from fleeing the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, Mr. Milosevic's actions have strengthened the  
unity and resolve of our allies,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials, meanwhile, said the administration has  
received assurances that Russian President Boris Yeltsin has not 
decided to target nuclear missiles against NATO countries, 
discounting an impression given by another Russian politician. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been officially reassured by Russia at a high level that  
Russia will not allow itself to be drawn into the conflict in the 
Balkans,'' said David Leavy, a White House spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeliene Albright was informed by Foreign  
Minister Igor Ivanov that the speaker said he had been 
misunderstood, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said ``we recognize we and the Russians have a  
disagreement on Kosovo.'' But he said the two countries continue to 
work together in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Rubin said after Albright's telephone conversation with  
Ivanov, the Russians have ``drawn a line'' between sympathy for the 
Serbs and taking military action to assist them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been assured the Russians will not get involved  
militarily kn Kosovo,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president laid out the conditions under which NATO  
airstrikes would stop: a withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo; the 
safe return of refugees under international protection; and 
allowing for some form of self-government for the Kosovar 
Albanians, who had made up 90 percent of the 1.9 million population 
of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Clinton said the U.S. military is helping ease the  
humanitarian crisis by transporting more than 1 million meals and 
other supplies to the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to do all we can to help the victims of this  
tragedy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. emergency relief official today requested Americans call  
1-800 USAID RELIEF and donate money to help more than 400,000 
ethnic Albanians who have fled Kosovo in the past three weeks to 
refugee camps in neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a human disaster and these people need our help,''  
James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, said on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. plan to house 20,000 refugees at a U.S. naval base at  
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, may be scrapped because refugees are being 
better cared for in Albania, Macedonia and elsewhere in Europe 
thanks to massive international relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's possible it won't happen,'' said J. Brian Atwood, the  
administration's foreign aid chief and also coordinator for the 
U.S. relief effort in support of the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a Cypriot leader was in the Yugoslav capital of  
Belgrade to meet with Milosevic today in hopes of securing the U.S. 
soldiers' release. But a Serb representative to the United Nations 
said it would be ``unnatural'' to expect his government ``to make a 
gesture of good will'' as NATO bombs contined to rain down. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of other priorities on our list, although we  
fully understand that issue is very sensitive for American public 
opinion,'' Vladislav Jovanovic said on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serbia's hard-line vice premier, Vojislav Seselj, said that  
freeing the three Americans was ``out of the question'' and that 
the soldiers should be tried as terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration said there won't be any negotiation  
for the release of the POWs or any pause in NATO airstrikes, except 
to allow safe passage for the acting president of Cyprus and the 
prisoners of war out of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the soldiers never should have been captured March  
31 since they were on a reconnaissance mission in Macedonia and 
were not part of NATO airstrikes that began March 24. Serb 
authorities claim the soldiers crossed into Yugoslav territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Spyros Kyprianou, speaker of the Cypriot parliament and acting  
president, said he hoped to secure the soldiers' release today or 
during the long Orthodox Easter weekend. But he also suggested NATO 
should relax its bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army has made contingency plans to reunite the families of  
the POWs with the soldiers in Europe as soon as possible after 
their release, a defense official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The POWs, who would probably travel to Cyprus after any release,  
most likely would then be taken to the Ramstein Air Base in 
Germany, where they could be reunited with their families and go to 
a nearby U.S. hospital for a medical examination, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three are Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles;  
Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.; and 
Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Huskies QB Sues Over Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Former Washington quarterback Shane Fortney has  
sued Jim Lambright, contending his ex-coach mishandled his knee 
injury in 1996 and hurt his chances to play professionally. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed Thursday in Everett and seeks unspecified  
damages for Lambright's ``reckless, malicious and unreasonable 
treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortney, now a builder in Maryland, told The Seattle Times he  
had not been inclined to file suit until Lambright threatened to 
sue the school for termination pay. Fortney has not sued the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just went too far,'' Fortney said. ``He needs to be  
humbled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lambright's lawyer, Tracy Codd, said he first became aware of  
the suit Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not received a copy of it,'' he said. ``Till then it  
would be inappropriate to comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortney hurt his right knee during the second game of the 1996  
season against Brigham Young, costing him the starting job. He 
played sporadically in three other games, but the injury caused a 
rift between Fortney and Lambright. The player transferred to 
Northern Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why the lawsuit names Lambright and not the school,  
Fortney lawyer David Beninger said: ``He's the one there day to 
day, he's the one that made the decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortney was injured when Lambright sent him into the game with  
less than two minutes remaining. He was tackled and sustained a 
partial tear of the posterior cruciate ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit says doctors knew or should have known the injury  
required surgery or four to six weeks to heal. Instead, it says, 
Lambright allowed Fortney to rest for less than two days before 
telling him to practice. 
</P>
<P>
	When Fortney left the Huskies, team doctor Steve Bramwell was  
asked if the player had been at increased risk playing and 
practicing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think so,'' Bramwell said. ``We wound up doing the  
same procedure. Whether he was at risk to do more (damage) is 
always an unknown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortney attended the NFL scouting combine a year ago and says he  
was not as fast or agile as when he was Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing my own thing right now,'' Fortney said. ``I'm done  
with football.''

<HEADLINE> Six Dead in Midwest, Plains Storms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A tornado with 200-mph winds demolished about  
200 houses in two Cincinnati suburbs before daybreak today, killing 
four people and leaving normally manicured yards littered with 
bricks, broken two-by-fours and tattered roofs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other people were killed in Illinois as powerful storms tore  
through the Midwest overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Cincinnati suburbs of Montgomery and Blue Ash, water  
spewed into the air from broken fire hydrants and shopping center 
parking lots were strewn with broken glass. Sheet metal that had 
been siding was wrapped around utility poles. Stately pines and 
thick sycamore and maple trees were yanked out by the roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsey Stiffler, 13, was asleep in her bedroom with the window  
open in Montgomery when she heard rain and hail and then a roaring 
noise. She looked out, saw the storm, and fled to the basement with 
her family. 
</P>
<P>
	When they emerged, the back portion of her neighbor's wooden  
house was split in two, with one side leaning over, she said. 
Elsewhere on her street, ``there were mattresses and curtains and 
everything sticking out of the windows,'' she said. ``Roofs were 
ripped off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie McGill, 13, her friend from down the street, told of a  
similar experience: ``I could hear everything flying through the 
house, smashing around. I didn't realize what was going on until I 
got outside. There was glass on the ground. The carport was lying 
against the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were killed in a house, and two in separate car  
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the victims, a 40-year-old man, was thrown from his car  
when the wind flipped it over, Blue Ash Police Chief Mike Allen 
said. The same gust flipped a tractor-trailer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio's Emergency Management Agency estimated 200 homes were  
destroyed and 400 damaged in Cincinnati's northeastern suburbs 
alone. The utility Cinergy said about 200,000 customers lost power. 
Most service had been restored by the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm also flipped motor homes and campers that convert to  
tents at the Dave Arbogast dealership in Tipp City, north of 
Dayton. ``We got about 10 tent campers in a nice, neat pile,'' said 
Ron West, a manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bob Taft said officials had no estimate of damage. He  
declared three counties emergency areas.

	``We saw homes where walls were torn down and chairs, tables and  
computers were sitting there untouched,'' he said. ``It's a total 
rebuilding effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Ashland, Ill., a community of 1,200, a tornado ripped into a  
trailer park and killed a 68-year-old woman. And a 43-year-old 
woman was killed in a mobile home in Cisco, 65 miles to the east. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms also damaged homes in Indiana. In Iowa, at least nine  
suspected tornadoes destroyed homes, flattened barns and uprooted 
trees.

Frisbie's farm near Adair, Iowa.

	``We barely made it to the basement,'' she said. ``We didn't  
really hear anything. All I was worried about was getting everybody 
to the basement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado also ravaged a five-block area in the Nebraska town of  
North Bend on Thursday afternoon, and the storm damaged buildings 
and downed power lines in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was napping,'' said Margaret Linville, whose barn was  
destroyed in Barnard, Mo. ``When I roused, the barn was gone, 
debris was still flying.''

<HEADLINE> College Football Hall To Induct 15 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Herschel Walker, one of the best runners  
in college history, and Don Coryell, the coach who helped 
revolutionize the passing game, were among 15 players and coaches 
from the College Football Hall of Fame's class of 1999 announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, the 1982 Heisman winner, was joined by the likes of  
Notre Dame end Ross Browner, Alabama guard John Hannah and Oklahoma 
running back Greg Pruitt in this year's class. The group will be 
inducted in December during a ceremony in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Browner, who went on to play with the Cincinnati Bengals and  
Green Bay Packers in the NFL from 1979-87, said he received the 
news April 1 and wasn't sure if it was a joke at first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just fell off my chair and praised God from that point on,''  
Browner said during a news conference at the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Another two-time All-American, Frank Loria, was honored  
posthumously. The Virginia Tech defensive back from 1965-67 went on 
to become the offensive coordinator at Marshall and was killed in 
the 1970 plane crash that killed most of the football team. 
</P>
<P>
	His son, Frank Jr., accepted the award, saying he never knew his  
father but knew he was more than just an athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell he was not only a great football player but a great  
man by the way people look at me and see a little bit of him in 
me,'' said Loria, whose mother was seven months pregnant with him 
when his father died. ``I know that my dad would be grateful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coryell led a class of coaches that were elected more for their  
impact on the game and their respective programs than their 
won-loss records, said Bob Hammel, a former sports editor and a 
member of the National Football Foundation's honors committee, 
which selects inductees from a list of nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a better mark of a Hall of Fame coach than someone  
going to a Nebraska or Alabama and winning. That's been done 
before,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coryell may be best remembered for his time with the San Diego  
Chargers, but he led San Diego State to three undefeated seasons 
during his 11-year tenure, including a 25-game unbeaten streak from 
1965-67. His squad followed its next loss with a 31-game unbeaten 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Claiborne coached Virginia Tech, Maryland and Kentucky  
during a 28-year career that ended in 1980 and Jim Young coached 
Arizona, Purdue and Army before retiring in 1990 after 16 years as 
a coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The other players inducted were end Chuck Dicus of Arkansas,  
running backs Chris Gilbert of Texas and Billy Kilmer of UCLA, 
linebacker Steve Kiner of Tennessee, quarterback Chuck Long of Iowa 
and defensive linemen Joe Palumbo of Virginia and Ed White of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 class will be enshrined in the hall next August. The  
1998 class -- which includes the likes of Tom Osborne, Bo Jackson 
and Jim McMahon -- will have their plaques placed in the hall Aug. 
13. 
</P>
<P>
	Players inducted into the hall must have received major  
first-team All-American recognition, played their last collegiate 
game 10 years before selection but no more than 50, and those who 
played their last year in 1983 and thereafter must be college 
graduates. The player's post-football record is also considered. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches become eligible three years after retirement, provided  
they coached a minimum of 10 years and at least 100 games with a 60 
percent winning percentage. That rule has been lifted each of the 
last two years to induct Osborne and former Grambling coach Eddie 
Robinson the year after their retirement.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Co. Unveils Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., the  
maker of Kool and Lucky Strike cigarettes, has unveiled a Web site 
that acknowledges in its strongest language ever the health risks 
associated with smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site also offers advice to kick the habit, but tobacco  
critics dismissed it as a smokescreen intended to shield the 
nation's third-largest tobacco company from future liability 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize that we're in a controversial industry,'' B&AMP;W  
spokesman Mark Smith said Friday. ``The launch of our new Web site 
is an attempt to demonstrate that we are a responsible company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The venture into cyberspace, which debuted this week, continues  
the tobacco industry's mantra that smoking is a personal choice, 
but offers an acknowledgment of potential health problems 
associated with smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brown &AMP; Williamson believes that people who choose to smoke  
are taking significant health risks,'' says the Web site for the 
Louisville-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Epidemiological studies of cigarette smoking and various  
diseases show that groups of smokers have a significantly increased 
incidence of those diseases compared to nonsmokers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Boyse, B&AMP;W's director of scientific communications, said  
it was the company's strongest statement yet about possible 
smoking-related health effects, and marked the industry's first 
such admission on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco foes said the site offers a carefully tailored viewpoint  
that doesn't offer a comprehensive look at smoking and its 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another attempt by a tobacco company to literally pull  
the wool over the eyes of the public and not tell the whole truth 
about their industry,'' said Ahron Leichtman, executive director of 
Citizens For a Tobacco-Free Society. 
</P>
<P>
	John Garrison, chief executive officer of the American Lung  
Association, said the Web site was a ``cruel hoax'' that seemed to 
be drafted by Brown &AMP; Williamson's lawyers. ``This is a very clever 
defensive maneuver to try to make themselves less liable as future 
lawsuits arrive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson publicized the Web site by taking out  
full-page ads in USA Today and planned ads in local newspapers in 
areas where the company has manufacturing facilities. The site even 
established links to the Web sites of the American Lung Association 
and the American Cancer Society, traditionally harsh critics of the 
tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site also offers a long list of ingredients in  
cigarettes, excluding the proprietary flavoring ingredients, and 
says it's appropriate for health authorities to warn that smoking 
is addictive. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Kuntz, an American Lung Association official in Kentucky,  
chastised Brown &AMP; Williamson for stopping short of calling nicotine 
addictive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same old worn-out dialogue, such as calling smoking  
an adult pleasure and comparing it to normal behavior like drinking 
coffee,'' he said. ``Caffeine is a drug, but it doesn't kill half a 
million Americans a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, said  
the Web site reflected the tobacco industry's conciliatory tone in 
the past couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This continues the sea change among the (tobacco) companies to  
the current realities of the risks of smoking,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a defector from Brown &AMP; Williamson, former vice president  
Jeffrey Wigand, who helped fuel the flurry of lawsuits by states 
against the nation's tobacco companies, leading to the landmark 
national settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Wigand, a former vice president for research, became an industry  
whistleblower with his claims that Brown &AMP; Williamson blocked 
production of a safer cigarette and knew for years that nicotine is 
addictive.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Patients' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- President Clinton and more than 100  
Democrats staged old-fashioned pep rallies and a newfangled 
Internet petition drive today, launching this year's fight for the 
``patients' bill of rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who are against it -- basically the large HMOs and  
the insurers -- have got the ear of the congressional majority,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless there is a clear, unambiguous signal from the people of  
the United States ... the organized forces of the status quo will 
do nothing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans who control Congress said they were at work on the  
legislation and warned against ``poisoning'' the process with 
partisan rancor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the banner at Clinton's back in Memorial Hall -- ``A Real  
Patients' Bill of Rights,'' with ``real'' italicized and outlined 
in red -- made clear what Democrats want Americans to think of the 
GOP alternative to Clinton's proposed new regulations on HMOs and 
other managed care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes to health care, Republicans want a declaration  
of independence, but no Constitution,'' said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, 
D-Conn. ``They want to declare their support for this bill of 
rights, but they don't want to establish the laws to make them a 
reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeLauro was among the dozen or more House Democrats and  
labor-union leaders who joined Clinton by bus from Capitol Hill, 
where they earlier unveiled a new Web site where computer users can 
register support for the package. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 90 Democrats fanned out across 32 states for similar  
rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Boehner, chairman of the House employer-employee  
relations subcommittee, said his panel has been at bipartisan work 
on the issue for the past two months with more hearings scheduled 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a grave injustice for the Democrat leadership to  
poison this process now with partisan rhetoric and political 
gamesmanship,'' said Boehner, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' no-holds-barred push for legislation that died in  
Congress last year is emboldened by their gains in November's 
congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate committee approved a more limited HMO bill on a  
party-line vote last month, but there has been no action in the 
House yet. Democrats complain the Senate bill would only cover 
about 48 million Americans who are in health plans regulated solely 
by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton arrived in Philadelphia armed with new figures that show  
his executive action last year extending such protections to 9 
million federal employees is costing less than $10 per person per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	At the president's side was Joan Bleakley of Woodbridge, Va.,  
the latest person brought forward in the Democrats' attempt to put 
a human face to their policy argument. Bleakley, wearing a patch 
over her left eye, said she sustained permanent vision loss after 
her HMO delayed in getting her to a neurologist for what turned out 
to be an aneurysm. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the legislation argue new regulations will drive up  
health costs and ``open the door to more lawsuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This helps trial lawyers who pocket most of the money, but  
does nothing to help patients get proper care when needed,'' said 
Dan Danner, chairman of the Health Benefits Coalition, which has 
run television ads in 19 states over the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican  
Conference, said the Democratic bill by Massachusetts Sen. Edward 
Kennedy would ``take us in the wrong direction, imposing higher 
costs and more bureaucracy on the system, putting quality care out 
of reach for too many Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials contend that the 285 health plans serving  
federal workers also serve private citizens and are providing these 
guarantees for just a few dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same things can be applied for all Americans,'' said Chris  
Jennings, Clinton's top health policy aide. 
</P>
<P>
	The president does not have the power to unilaterally extend to  
federal workers the most controversial -- and most expensive -- 
provision Democrats are pushing: the right to sue health plans and 
collect damages when they withhold treatment. Nor has Clinton 
required the plans to pay for ``medically necessary'' care, as 
determined by doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	But today, Clinton required federal workers' health plans to  
adopt two popular provisions: 
</P>
<P>
	-- The mandatory release of information about customer  
satisfaction, the quality of doctors and hospitals, and how doctors 
are paid. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The allowance for patients to stay with their doctors for 90  
days, even if the doctor is dropped from the network, if patients 
are in the middle of a treatment or pregnancy. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japan's Life of Work Ends in Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- After nearly 40 years on the job, Masaharu Nonaka  
felt he was getting the squeeze. His bosses at Bridgestone Sports 
Co. demoted him, cut his salary and then offered him early 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not go quietly.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the best way is to die ... in anger,'' Nonaka, 58,  
wrote in a protest letter sent to the Japanese media in February. 
</P>
<P>
	It was no idle threat. A month later he stormed into parent  
company Bridgestone Corp., protested to President Yoichiro Kaizaki 
and stabbed himself to death with a kitchen knife. 
</P>
<P>
	All over Japan, older workers are being prodded -- some say  
bullied -- into early retirement. Companies say the staff cuts are a 
last resort, but for people like Nonaka, trained for decades to 
skip meals, brave fatigue and forgo vacations in return for a job 
for life, it's like being excommunicated by their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring is born out of necessity.  
</P>
<P>
	Japan is battling its deepest, most persistent recession since  
the end of World War II, and many top-flight corporations are 
grappling with hefty losses. Electronics giant NEC Corp. is cutting 
15,000 jobs over the next three years, and Sony Corp. is cutting 
17,000 jobs and closing factories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japanese white-collar workers ... are dependent on their  
companies. The company is like a community,'' said Kiyotsugu 
Shitara, head of the Tokyo Manager's Union. ``But these days, 
employers are beginning to say that no longer exists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonaka's career is a record of the changing times.  
</P>
<P>
	He joined Bridgestone -- now one of the world's premier  
tire-makers -- in 1959, just as Japan's economy was about to take 
off. Lifetime employment was taken for granted. In 1992, he was 
transferred to Bridgestone Sports, where he headed the general 
affairs department. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, business practices were changing at  
Bridgestone. 
</P>
<P>
	The company bought Firestone of the United States and went on a  
campaign to trim the fat and compete globally. By last year, the 
company had cut 3,700 jobs from its 1992 staff of 16,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonaka was caught in that wave. In 1997, when he hit the  
company's management retirement age of 56, the pressure was on. In 
accordance with company regulations, he was demoted and suffered a 
pay cut. By last year, it was clear the company wanted him to 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
	He was bitter.  
</P>
<P>
	``Bridgestone was built up by employees who worked hard ... They  
even forgot to eat and sleep and didn't even have time to care 
about their families,'' Nonaka wrote in February in a letter 
provided by the Asahi newspaper. ``But these days our colleagues 
are being forced to retire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called for a change in policy, criticized President Kaizaki's  
restructuring efforts and then said he was willing to die to make 
his point -- and suggested he might take Kaizaki with him. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 23, he met with Kaizaki in a reception room at  
Bridgestone. Growing agitated, at the end of the meeting he 
stripped down to his underwear and plunged a 14-inch knife into his 
belly. He died at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	A second knife -- unused -- was found at the scene. No one else  
was injured, and company officials said Kaizaki did not witness the 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has become a cause celebre for the country's legions of  
white-collar ``salarymen'' and has unleashed a stream of criticism 
against restructuring in general and Bridgestone in particular. 
</P>
<P>
	Bridgestone stands by its restructuring policy, arguing that  
much of the downsizing has been accomplished by reducing the number 
of new hires. The company also says it never pressures older 
workers to retire early. 
</P>
<P>
	But it offers tempting incentives. A company spokesman said  
Nonaka himself agreed to quit early, accepting a $230,000 package -- 
double what he would have gotten without the special deal. The 
money will now go to his family. 
</P>
<P>
	For Bridgestone, the ``trim the fat'' policy is working. The  
company announced that net earnings hit a record $864.5 million in 
1998, the latest in a string of good years, and its foreign sales 
are booming. 
</P>
<P>
	To Nonaka, however, the new corporate ethic meant a cruel  
turning of the tables on a loyal employee. He killed himself a week 
before he was to work his last day at Bridgestone. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no other way than this,'' he wrote.

<HEADLINE> Police Agree To U.S. Traffic Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police chiefs from some of the nation's  
largest departments said today they will create a national traffic 
stop policy that they said will ensure that minorities are not 
unfairly targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	The police chiefs made the announcement at a news conference  
with minority activists to launch what they described as an honest 
discussion on police and race. It came after a day of closed door 
meetings between police executives and community leaders 
coordinated by the Police Executive Research Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are to deal with it, we must stipulate that race is an  
issue in policing,'' Philadelphia Police Commissioner John Timoney 
said. ``There are an awful lot of people in denial, but so be it. 
We must move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public attention has been focused on police conduct since  
February's fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx borough of 
New York City. Four officers from New York's elite street crimes 
unit fired 41 shots at Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant, 
hitting him 19 times. His killing prompted numerous protests in New 
York and Washington. The officers have been charged with 
second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The still-evolving traffic stop policy would stress courtesy to  
build respect between minorities and police. One guideline being 
discussed would require officers to tell drivers why they had been 
stopped and to apologize if no violations are found. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department is investigating allegations of racial  
profiling -- targeting minorities for an unjustified amount of 
police attention -- by the New Jersey State Police and by police 
agencies in Eastpointe, Mich., and Orange County, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, Gov. Christie Whitman fired State Police  
Superintendent Carl Williams following published remarks in which 
he said minorities were responsible for most of the cocaine and 
marijuana traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno expressed serious concerns about  
racial profiling in comments to reporters Thursday, and she 
discussed it at a private meeting with the gathered police chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 35 chiefs and activists at the conference also  
discussed adopting a program like one used in San Diego where 
police record the race of people they stop. That data is used to 
assess whether police are, in fact, relying on racial profiling in 
making traffic stops. 
</P>
<P>
	But Baltimore Police Chief Thomas Frazier, president of the  
Police Executive Research Forum, said no consensus had yet been 
reached on whether it would be workable for a national model. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said that without a meaningful way  
of tracking who was being stopped by police and why, the traffic 
stop policy would be ``only window dressing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it will eliminate the problem at all because  
you're still going to have one person's word against the other, and 
one of those people is a cop,'' said Meeks, a member of the 
Congressional Black Caucus. ``It's meaningless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frazier said there were no plans to create a national policy on  
controversial stop-and-frisk practices like those used by the 
NYPD's street crimes unit. Such procedures are largely governed by 
individual states' case law, and it creating a national model would 
be difficult, he said.

<HEADLINE> Cyrus Records 'Scooby-Doo' Theme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Why mess with a classic?  
</P>
<P>
	Country singer Billy Ray Cyrus recorded the theme song from the  
``Scooby-Doo'' cartoon Thursday at a Nashville recording studio. 
</P>
<P>
	The song will be used in a direct-to-video cartoon titled  
``Scooby-Doo and the Witch's Ghost.'' He said he was a longstanding 
fan of the mystery-solving dog of Saturday morning cartoon fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to stay as close to the original as possible, and add  
some of my own flavor to it,'' said Cyrus, who became a country 
music star in 1992 with his No. 1 hit ``Achy Breaky Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably could have done it with no practice at all, because  
I've been a fan so long I know the song so well already,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scooby-Doo and the Witch's Ghost'' is set for release Oct. 5.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Trek To Be Tracked Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The Bengal Brothers are a couple of high-tech  
tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,882-mile journey of the white tigers from Sacramento,  
Calif., to New Orleans' Audubon Zoo begins soon and anyone with 
access to the Internet can tag along. 
</P>
<P>
	Audubon Zoo on Thursday went online with sneak previews of its  
grandest acquisition this year. Web surfers are provided with 
behind-the-scene details of the voyage of the 2-year-old, 270-pound 
tigers with white fur, blue eyes and pink noses. 
</P>
<P>
	The duo replaces Suri, a white Bengal tiger who entertained  
visitors at the Audubon Zoo for 16 years until her recent death. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Isles, the zoo's senior mammals curator, has added to his  
job description the title of correspondent, providing a daily 
journal of the cross-country move. His task began with transporting 
two Sumatran tigers from New Orleans to the Sacramento zoo for use 
in a breeding program. 
</P>
<P>
	The www.NOLA.com Web site also features a long list of facts  
about the Bengals: They can jump 15 feet in the air. They are 
endangered. They devour four pounds of ground meat mixed with

<HEADLINE> U.S. Must Pay $909M to Thrift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge ordered the federal government today  
to pay $909 million to a California savings and loan, the first of 
what may be numerous damage awards over a 1989 accounting rule 
change that plunged many thrifts into financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Judge Loren Smith of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims told  
the government to pay Glendale Federal Bank for breach of contract. 
Glendale had hoped for an award of $1 billion to $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling stems from a 1996 Supreme Court decision that said  
the government broke its contract with Glendale and two other 
thrifts when it changed the rules on how they must count their 
assets. The justices said the government could be forced to pay 
damages to the S&AMP;Ls for their financial harm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Restitution provides a remedy, and a fair one,'' Smith's  
decision said. ``The government received a very significant benefit 
in 1981'' when Glendale agreed to take over an ailing Florida S&AMP;L. 
The government ``then failed to honor its promise to Glendale upon 
which the contract was premised,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one should be surprised that this decision affirms that the  
government must honor the contracts it makes,'' Glendale's lawyer, 
Ronald Stevens, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said, ``We remain confident in our  
position and look forward to a fair and expeditious final 
resolution'' of the S&AMP;L cases. Privately, Justice lawyers said they 
were pleased the judge did not award the full $2 billion Glendale 
had sought. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar damage claims have been filed against the government by  
about 125 other thrifts, many of which were declared insolvent 
after the 1989 rule change. Some of them have reached financial 
settlements with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Glendale case was the first to reach a judge's decision  
on how much the government must pay, and it was being closely 
watched for the standards it might set for assessing the other 
thrifts' claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's opinion said he ``strongly believes that settlements,  
where fair compromise occurs, are in everyone's interest. The court 
calls upon all parties involved in pending cases to consider what 
alternatives, short of continuing litigation over the coming years, 
may resolve these cases fairly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith issued his decision in late afternoon, after the stock  
markets closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1989 accounting rule change was part of the government's  
effort to rescue the then-troubled thrift industry -- a cleanup that 
overall has cost about $200 billion. The federal law that brought 
about the change tightened rules and provided money to close 
insolvent S&AMP;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, the government had encouraged healthy thrifts to  
take over insolvent ones by letting them count the insolvent S&AMP;L's 
losses as ``goodwill'' assets. The rule change said S&AMP;Ls no longer 
could count such assets toward their minimum capital requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule forced many previously healthy S&AMP;Ls into the red.  
Among them was Glendale, which had taken over a troubled thrift and 
counted $734 million as goodwill assets. After the rule change, 
Glendale had to raise about $450 million to meet its capital 
minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	The government insisted to the Supreme Court that it never  
promised the S&AMP;Ls they would be protected from rule changes. But 
the justices decided otherwise in a 7-2 ruling that exposed the 
government to the possibility of paying billions of dollars in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would, indeed, have been madness'' for the S&AMP;Ls to agree to  
take over ailing thrifts without a binding promise that they could 
rely on the accounting rules then in effect, Justice David H. 
Souter wrote for the nation's highest court in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Glendale's case then returned to Smith to set the amount of  
damages the government must pay. The S&AMP;L's lawyers sought to boost 
the award by arguing Glendale was entitled to recover all the 
profits it would have made if the rules had not changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Glendale's calculation of lost profits was ``too  
remote and speculative.'' Instead, he calculated the damages as 
restitution and to compensate the S&AMP;L for damage caused when it 
fell below the capital minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	Glendale has since merged with California Federal Bank, which is  
owned by Golden State Bancorp of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Glendale's representatives say other industries -- including  
electric utilities and low-income housing developers -- may be able 
to use the 1996 Supreme Court ruling to argue that the federal 
government broke promises to them and should be forced to pay 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The case acted on Friday is Glendale Federal Bank vs. U.S.,  
90-772C.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Sign Martin to 4-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Dolphins signed receiver Tony Martin to a  
four-year contract, even though legal trouble could keep him from 
playing this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was for at least $14 million, including a $3.3 million  
signing bonus, according to published reports. But Martin, a former 
Dolphin, might be able to keep only $100,000 if he is convicted on 
federal charges of laundering drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's trial was postponed today until Aug. 2, four days after  
training camp opens and six weeks before the season begins. The 
trial could take a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins wouldn't confirm the contract Friday. Martin's  
agent, Jimmy Sexton, couldn't be immediately reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	If Martin is acquitted, he could provide the Dolphins the deep  
receiving threat that Dan Marino has lacked in recent years. Martin 
would likely start along with O.J. McDuffie, who led the NFL last 
year with 90 receptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season Martin caught 66 passes for 1,181 yards for NFC  
champion Atlanta, but the Falcons released him in February 
following his indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with the Dolphins follows six weeks of negotiations.  
The contract calls for a base salary of $400,000 in 1999, at least 
$2.1 million in 2000 and at least $8.4 million in the final two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who will be 34 this season, played with the Dolphins  
from 1990 to 1993, averaging 27 catches and two touchdowns per 
season. He was traded to San Diego for a fourth-round draft pick 
and blossomed in 1995, catching 90 passes for 1,224 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was traded to Atlanta before the 1998 season and sparked  
the Falcons' surprising run to the Super Bowl. He caught five 
passes for 129 yards in the NFC championship game against 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins have repeatedly been frustrated in their attempts  
to acquire a deep receiving threat. Yatil Green, a first-round 
draft choice in 1997, has yet to play a down because of knee 
injuries, and last year Miami missed a chance to draft Randy Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore, who earlier declined  
Martin's request to postpone the trial until January, agreed to 
delay it three months from May 3. Trial is expected to last from 
three to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin faces trial with Rickey Brownlee, who served seven years  
in prison for 1980s drug convictions. They became friends in high 
school, and prosecutors allege that Martin wrote checks to lease 
luxury cars and pay legal fees for Brownlee. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin has said he's innocent. He's not charged with any  
involvement in drug activity.

<HEADLINE> Producer Prices Rise 0.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices charged by factories and other  
producers remained tame in March, but the biggest increase in crude 
oil costs since the Gulf War signaled a temporary burst of 
inflation in the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department's Producer Price Index for finished goods  
rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent, bringing the annualized 
rate of increase for the first three months of 1999 to 1.5 percent, 
the Labor Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The unexpectedly mild report reassured Wall Street that any  
interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve is still months 
away. The Dow Jones average of industrial stocks held near 
Thursday's record close, slipping only 24 points to 10,174. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inflation remains dead,'' said economist Stan Shipley of  
Merrill Lynch. ``It will ... help keep the Fed on hold despite 
strong economic growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, prices of finished energy goods jumped sharply in  
March, by 1.2 percent, with gasoline rising 3.5 percent, heating 
oil soaring 13.1 percent -- the most in five years, residential 
electricity edging 0.2 percent higher and natural gas falling 1.8 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans face even sharper energy increases in the months  
ahead, especially if last month's pact among members of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries holds up. Crude 
petroleum jumped 27.1 percent in March, the biggest increase since 
October 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first impact of the agreement by oil producers to limit  
production is apparent,'' said economist Donald Ratajczak of 
Georgia State University. ``Further gains are likely next month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question is whether higher energy costs will work their way  
through the price chain, resulting in any significant acceleration 
in overall consumer price inflation, which last year sank to a 
12-year low of 1.6 percent. So far the judgment of most analysts is 
``no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While inflation can pick up -- and it may pick up to 2.5  
percent -- the days of 4-, 5-, 6-percent inflation look to be long 
gone,'' said economic consultant Joel Naroff of Holland, Pa. ``It's 
going to take a lot more than just oil prices to create real 
inflation problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the volatile food and energy components, prices were  
unchanged in March for the second consecutive month. That reflects 
pressure on domestic producers to compete with cheaply priced 
imports. Auto prices, for instance, fell 0.5 percent in March and 
household appliances, 1.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American economy has found a vaccination for the inflation  
bug in the form of higher productivity and international 
competition,'' said economist David Huether of the National 
Association of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Food costs paid by wholesalers rose a moderate 0.4 percent last  
month. Fruit prices fell 5.5 percent, reflecting an 18.5 percent 
drop for navel oranges and 5.9 percent for golden delicious apples. 
</P>
<P>
	However, vegetable prices soared 20.2 percent, the most in eight  
months, reflecting increases of 115.5 percent for eggplant, 67.9 
percent for corn, 67.1 percent for lettuce and 45.4 percent for 
tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fish prices jumped 9.4 percent, the largest rise in nearly 13  
years. Pork and beef rose, too. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, at earlier stages of the production process, prices  
rose 0.3 percent for intermediate goods and 1 percent for crude 
goods. An example of the three stages is bread for finished, flour 
for intermediate and wheat for crude.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Power Plant Blast Kills 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Investigators suspect a hydrogen gas leak may  
have led to the thunderous explosion that ripped open an electric 
power plant, killing two workers and injuring 49 others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a huge fireball,'' said Arthur Fedor, who suffered minor  
injuries in Thursday's blast at a Tampa Electric Co. plant on the 
edge of Tampa Bay. ``I thought I was back in Vietnam somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 49 injured, three were hospitalized in critical condition  
and a fourth was listed in serious condition late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Johnny Bass, 52, who worked for a contractor hired  
to do spring maintenance at the plant, was pulled from rubble. 
Another worker who suffered burns, Edward Barker, 57, died at a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast ripped a huge section from a building holding six  
coal-fired generators. The force of the explosion hurled 200-pound 
siding tiles across an electrical yard and was heard at least 35 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was going to meet my maker or go to hell ... and  
it made me want to get right with God,'' said Robert Worley, a 
worker who escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
	A leak of hydrogen gas was believed to have caused the  
explosion, which happened as contractors tested a generator 
following routine maintenance. Hydrogen is used as a coolant for 
the generators. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, with a work force of about 250, was shut down after  
the blast. The utility and investigators from the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration will assess damage before deciding 
when the plant may reopen, said utility spokesman Steve Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Electrical service to the company's 500,000 customers was not  
interrupted.

<HEADLINE> Coupon Mistake To Cost Casino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A mailing error could wind up costing  
the Flamingo Hilton Casino as much as $1 million by the time 
thousands of small-time gamblers redeem coupons that were supposed 
to go to high-rollers only. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a mistake. A very bad mistake,'' said Kathy Zeller,  
comptroller for the Kansas City casino. ``But we are going to go 
ahead and honor the coupons until we can get new ones in the 
mail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The casino intended to mail out two sets of promotional coupons,  
one to a select group of high rollers and another to a much larger 
listing of lesser gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-roller coupons allow a player to get $75 worth of chips  
for $25. Regular coupons gave out $30 in chips for $25. 
</P>
<P>
	Each set contains ten coupons, which can be redeemed one per  
week over ten weeks. That meant high rollers could get a total $500 
in free chips and the others $50 in free chips, if all ten coupons 
were cashed in. 
</P>
<P>
	But the high-roller coupons worth $50 apiece were sent out to  
the list of lesser gamblers, causing a stampede at the casino 
beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	After giving away what one Flamingo executive estimated was  
$250,000 in free chips in a half-week's time, the casino stopped 
honoring the coupons today. 
</P>
<P>
	That did not go over well, as gamblers stomped around the casino  
demanding to talk to whoever was in charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bet you did this on purpose just to get us in here,'' one  
man said to a harried worker after the shutoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Some gamblers said they traveled 100 miles or more to take  
advantage of the deal. Said one casino worker, ``I've never seen so 
many people so upset. People were practically spitting in my 
face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five hours after the shutoff, the casino decided to reverse  
itself, for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided the only fair thing to do would be to go ahead and  
honor them. It was our mistake, not the players' mistake,'' Zeller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino planned to mail the same people new coupons worth the  
intended value of $5 apiece. Once those are delivered, the casino 
will no longer honor the high-valued coupons. Meantime, if the 
current coupons are redeemed next week at the same rate as this 
week, the casino could lose an estimated $1 million overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``You think somebody's not going to lose their job over this?''  
said a casino executive who asked not to be identified.

<HEADLINE> Markets Are Not Always Rational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't try to tell investors in bond and money  
market mutual funds that the financial markets are always rational 
and efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	When they comparison-shop among high-quality and high-yield bond  
funds, taxable and tax-exempt bond funds, or taxable and tax-exempt 
money funds, they find some amazing anomalies and inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
	For example: Often in recent years, funds investing in  
lower-quality ``junk'' bonds get so popular that their yields 
barely exceed those of funds concentrating on bonds with safer 
credit ratings. You don't have to resist temptation to steer clear 
of junk bonds at those points; the cost of greater safety is very 
small. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Russian default last August, quality spreads in the  
bond market widened dramatically almost overnight. Then investors 
were offered much more generous rewards for taking the extra risks 
that come with lower-rated bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	By the tally of the newsletter Income Fund Outlook in Deerfield  
Beach, Fla., yields on junk bond funds lately have averaged about 
9.4 percent, compared to 5.7 percent for funds owning higher-rated 
corporate bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Second example: Look at the gap between yields on corporate bond  
investments, which pay interest that is subject to income tax, and 
municipal bond investments, which pay interest that is exempt from 
federal income taxes and sometimes state income taxes as well. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the time lately, muni-bond yields have hovered  
between 90 percent and 100 percent of comparable taxable yields. If 
these markets were truly efficient, you'd think muni yields would 
be much lower, given that most investors face federal tax rates of 
at least 28 percent on each extra dollar of taxable income they 
receive. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, there are many factors that can explain yield spreads at  
any given time. Lots of taxable bonds, for one thing, are owned by 
investors such as pension plans that don't have to pay current 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, from the point of view of an individual investor  
buying for a taxable account, the markets look very inefficient. 
Suppose you are an investor in the 28 percent bracket, evaluating a 
muni fund that yields 5 percent against a taxable bond fund that 
yields 5.5 percent. Reduce 5.5 by 28 percent, and you get an 
after-tax yield of 3.96 percent -- more than a full point less than 
the after-tax yield available to you from the muni fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Interestingly, if you make the same kind of calculation in  
today's short-term money market, the comparison comes out just as 
lopsided in the other direction, in favor of taxable funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The average tax-free money fund currently produces a yield of  
2.5 percent per annum,'' notes the Income Fund Outlook. ``Even for 
investors in the top 39.6 percent federal bracket, a 2.5 percent 
tax-free return is the equivalent of only a 4.1 percent taxable 
yield. The average taxable money field is yielding more than 4.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put it another way, an investor in the 39.6 percent bracket  
who holds the average taxable money fund yielding 4.5 percent will 
net more after taxes, 2.7 percent, than he or she would earn in the 
average tax-free fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any way you slice it, tax-free money funds are a dubious  
investment at this juncture. If you hold tax-free money funds, you 
should compare your after-tax returns on an alternative taxable 
fund with what your tax-free fund is currently earning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In most cases, it is a simple maneuver to switch your money from  
a tax-exempt fund to a taxable money fund, perhaps even one 
operating in the same fund family. 
</P>
<P>
	The same discrepancies might not exist the next time you revisit  
these markets, looking for the best place to put your money. They 
could have vanished by then -- or, just possibly, they might be even 
more pronounced than they have been lately. 
</P>
<P>
	The point is, you can't ever assume that the professionals have  
arbitraged away all imbalances in the markets where you invest, 
making it unnecessary for you to do any research on your own. A 
cheap hand-held calculator can still be a valuable investment 
tool.

<HEADLINE> Europe Oil Cos. To Gain in Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The United Nations decision to end economic  
sanctions against Libya will give the country's underdeveloped oil 
industry access to the spare parts and money needed to expand 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	That should also be a boon to foreign oil companies that do  
business in Libya, but American companies will be left at a 
competitive disadvantage because sanctions imposed by the U.S. 
government remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations on Monday suspended its seven-year  
restrictions on trade with Libya, ending a ban on international 
flights there. The world body acted after Libya handed over two 
citizens suspected of blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, 
Scotland, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see a great future in Libya, and certainly the lifting of  
sanctions will make life a whole lot easier,'' said Andrew Harber, 
a manager in Britain for the Swedish company Lundin Oil AB. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.N. action is unlikely to unleash a fresh wave of  
European oil companies into Libya, analysts say, because most firms 
with an interest in the country are already operating there. For 
them, U.N. sanctions were more of an inconvenience than a real 
impediment. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, new, direct flights to the Libyan capital will save time  
for visiting managers and drilling crews, who previously had to 
drive to Tripoli from the neighboring country of Tunisia, a 
five-hour journey. Only two days after the sanctions were lifted, 
British Airways announced it would start flying three flights a 
week from London to Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
	The new relations will also likely mean faster international  
money transfers that should help companies complete their projects 
more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	With proven reserves of 30 billion barrels, Libya has as much  
oil as Norway and Britain combined. Its reserves are smaller than 
Mexico's 50 billion barrels, but larger than those of fellow OPEC 
members Nigeria and Indonesia. And its low-sulfur crude fetches a 
premium on global markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Libya also has natural gas reserves of 45.9 trillion cubic feet,  
comparable to those of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Libyans have managed to keep up steady levels of crude  
production despite U.N. and U.S. sanctions, pumping 1.39 million 
barrels a day last year, according to the International Energy 
Agency. Promising areas of the country remain to be explored. 
Lundin, the Swedish firm, is prospecting at En Naga in the Sahara, 
620 miles southeast of Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Conoco Inc. first struck oil in Libya in 1955.  
Since withdrawing from Libya 13 years ago, Conoco has had to forgo 
the production and sale of 300 million barrels of oil worth $5 
billion, company spokesman Carlton Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
	European energy companies such as Italy's ENI, Repsol of Spain  
and Austria's OMV helped fill the void created by the American 
exodus. 
</P>
<P>
	The competitive position of U.S. companies will erode further if  
non-U.S. firms are the only ones allowed to do business in Libya, 
Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one likes to sit on their hands while their competitors are  
out there looking for oil. Libya is a proven producer, it has a lot 
of reserves and it's close to European markets,'' said Peter Bogin 
of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a Paris-based consulting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	For Libya's oil industry, sanctions have hurt most by blocking  
imports of certain types of equipment. The U.S. embargo continues 
to deny Libya access to specific technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanctions also have stifled investment. Since 1996, the U.S.  
Iran-Libya Sanctions Act has barred foreign firms from making new 
investments of $40 million or more -- a ceiling that European 
companies seem to be respecting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a difficult environment in which to operate, but  
certainly not an impossible one,'' said Bogin, of the Paris 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Libya's production capacity will expand slowly, but in the long  
run, analysts say, the improvements may embolden it to pump more 
oil than its OPEC production limits allow. 
</P>
<P>
	Libyan diplomats in London refused to comment when asked about  
this possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center for Global Energy  
Studies in London, said Libya already has one of the worst records 
of compliance with OPEC production limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Libya is one of those countries that pay lip service to an  
agreement but then don't comply fully,'' he said.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Gene Benson, a charismatic outfielder who  
starred in the Negro Leagues in the 1940s and mentored a young 
Jackie Robinson before Robinson broke baseball's racial barrier, 
died Tuesday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson played for over a decade in the Negro Leagues in the  
1930s and 40s. He debuted with the Philadelphia Stars in 1937 
before being traded to the Pittsburgh Crawfords in 1938. A year 
later, he returned to the Stars, where he played into the late 
1940s. 
</P>

photographs of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and Gen. Douglas 
MacArthur signing the Japanese surrender aboard the USS Missouri, 
died Monday. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordeiro's career began at age 17 as a Honolulu high school  
student armed with a 35mm Leica camera borrowed from a teacher. An 
editor at the Honolulu Star Bulletin had asked him to snap a few 
shots of military maneuvers at the Navy base on a quiet Sunday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	From his vantage point on Dec. 7, 1941, he captured the USS Shaw  
exploding into a ball of flames. That famous photograph, seen 
around the world, rallied Americans for battle. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Army and, after being wounded in combat in the  
Philippines, exchanged his rifle for a camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordeiro earned a Bronze Star for his photography behind enemy  
lines in Korea. He retired in 1964 as a master sergeant, moving 
from Japan to the Rogue Valley in southern Oregon.

</P>
<P>
	He collapsed during a weekly media pick-up hockey game.  
</P>
<P>
	Peterson began his journalism career with United Press  
International in 1979. A year later, he joined the AP's Kansas City 
bureau. In November 1984, he was named correspondent in St. Louis, 
where he stayed until July 1989.

expert on the origin of mammals, died Monday of pancreatic cancer. 
He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Savage, an expert on the evolution of anthropoid apes, was  
professor emeritus of paleontology at University of California at 
Berkeley and former director of the school's Museum of 
Paleontology. He also was an authority on San Francisco Bay area 
fossils. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus of his work was correlating mammal fossils with  
specific geologic formations. The method was used to date fossils 
before radioisotope became the standard. 
</P>

<P>
	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Cardinal Raul Silva Henriquez, an  
outspoken defender of human rights during Chile's military 
dictatorship, died Friday. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Silva's order said he died of cardio-respiratory failure at a  
home for retired priests. He had been suffering from Alzheimer's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The cardinal's defense of human rights made the church a  
prominent opponent of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's military regime, 
which seized power in 1973 and ruled until 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Silva also was one of Chile's most forceful advocates of  
dialogue and reconciliation after years of a chaotic Marxist-led 
government and the repressive military rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Silva received a law degree from Catholic University in Santiago  
in 1929 and was ordained a priest nine years later. Named 
Archbishop of Santiago in 1960, he became a cardinal two years 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
	It was during Pinochet's regime that Silva became a symbol of  
human rights. He sponsored a group that gave legal aid to political 
prisoners and helped people dismissed for political reasons find 
jobs. He also worked to collect evidence of torture and other human 
rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean report says 3,197 people were killed or  
disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police after he 
toppled elected President Salvador Allende in a bloody coup. 
</P>
<P>
	After Pinochet disbanded Silva's group, the cardinal replaced it  
with an organization called the Vicariate of Solidarity, which for 
years aided the victims of repression.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Finds Glamorous Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUBANK, Ky. (AP) -- Former Miss America Venus Ramey is taking on  
the U.S. government over its tobacco policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramey filed a federal lawsuit against the U.S. Justice  
Department last week, seeking $300 billion. The suit accuses the 
government and President Clinton of trying ``to destroy a 
successful, lucrative American industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramey, who was Miss America 1944, is now 74 and living on a  
tobacco farm north of Eubank. She wants to get farmers back on 
their feet by using any money she is awarded to build tobacco 
manufacturing facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we lose tobacco, small farmers cannot make it,'' she said.  
``There is no substitute crop that brings in as much money as 
tobacco.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramey, who represented the District of Columbia in the Miss  
America pageant, said her family has grown tobacco for 350 years 
and she has been a tobacco farmer for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies reached a $246 billion settlement with states  
over health-related lawsuits last year. The companies say the 
resulting increase in the cost of cigarettes has caused a decline 
in smoking.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Down 23.86 at 10,173.84 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A rally in technology shares today helped two  
broad stock market indicators set records for a fourth time this 
week while the Dow industrials faltered for the first time in two 
days as traders paused to take profits on blue-chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  
was down 23.86 at 10,173.84. The average of 30 blue-chip stocks 
soared to record levels three times this week, including yesterday, 
when it closed at 10,197.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite today's decline, the Dow is up 341.33 since last Friday  
and by nearly 11 percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index added to Thursday's record with its  
17.43-point climb to 2,590.82, according to preliminary 
calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	Also vaulting to a new high for the fourth time this week was  
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, rising 4.37 to 1,348.35. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the Internet stocks leading today,'' said Larry  
Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dow was just taking a breather,'' he said. ``But when you  
think about what went on this week, taking a breather isn't so 
bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helping the market, the Labor Department said today that prices  
paid to producers such as factories and refineries rose a 
milder-than-expected 0.2 percent in March, suggesting inflation 
remains in check. With inflation mild, the Federal Reserve is 
unlikely to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The news today confirms that the American economy has found a  
vaccination for the inflation bug in the form of higher 
productivity and international competition,'' said David Huether, 
an analyst at the National Association of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report on wholesale prices also noted that crude oil  
rose 29 percent in March, the biggest increase since the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite higher fuel costs, airline stocks advanced on the New  
York Stock Exchange. Some of the gains were attributed to 
Continental Airlines' announcement that it raised its fares. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental rose 3 1/16 at 40 7/8, Delta Airlines rose 4 1/4 to 71  
9/16 and UAL Corp. rose 1 7/8 to 78 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Sending the Dow lower was Union Carbide, off 3 5/16 to 48 1/16,  
after Morgan Stanley cut its rating of the chemical company. 
Analysts have dismissed takeover rumors involving the company. 
Another Dow component, General Motors, was down 2 1/4 at 85 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were continuing their upward march. Online  
auction company eBay rose 11 1/2 at 183 1/4 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the Nasdaq, theglobe.com soared 19 3/8 o 76 3/8. The Internet  
service provider announced a 2-for-1 stock split late Thursday. 
Investors also bought up iTurf, the teen clothing and chat site 
that went pubic today. The stock was priced at $22 and rose to 57 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.5 percent. In  
Europe, Germany's DAX index rose 1.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 
rose 0.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 1.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> McDougal Juror Mishap Halts Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal's trial for refusing to  
cooperate with the Whitewater probe was disrupted today when one of 
the 12 jurors deliberating her fate brought a law book into the 
jury room. 
</P>
<P>
	While the case apparently could continue with 11 jurors,  
deliberations were suspended this morning and a conference was held 
before U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the ``first time this has happened in 19 years'' on the  
bench, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's prosecutors asked that the  
juror be dismissed, but Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, 
requested time to research the issue before Howard ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors told the court clerk, who discovered the volume and  
retrieved it from the jury room, that they hadn't looked at it. 
</P>
<P>
	But the juror who brought it into the room, Michael Nance of  
Little Rock, ``is appealing to some other authority; it's very 
serious,'' said Starr prosecutor Mark Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't see how this juror can't be excused,'' said Barrett.  
</P>
<P>
	Federal court rules allow a trial to proceed with 11 jurors in  
an emergency, if neither the prosecution nor defense objects. If 
either side complains, the judge must decide whether the case 
should go forward, usually giving much greater weight to the 
defendant's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nance brought to the jury room the 1996 Arkansas Criminal Code.  
Barrett said he didn't care that the book didn't apply in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The book contains a handwritten notation referring to a court  
rule that says prospective jurors shall receive instructions 
explaining legal terminology. 
</P>
<P>
	The law book contained the business card of a former Arkansas  
Supreme Court justice and ex-Democratic state representative, John 
Purtle. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Purtle said he has no idea how his card came to  
be in the book. Purtle said Nance's name ``sounds familiar,'' but 
``no, I don't know Michael Nance.'' Purtle says he knows the 
Clintons and Mrs. McDougal, but has no connection to the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the issue came up today, Barrett told reporters a federal  
law allows criminal cases to proceed with 11 jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	The alternate jurors have already been dismissed from duty.  
There would be substantial legal problems in bringing back one of 
the alternates to replace a missing juror. 
</P>
<P>
	Signaling that Mrs. McDougal's testimony made a deep impression,  
jurors sent out three notes in their first day of deliberations 
Thursday, asking whether they could consider her motives for 
refusing to testify in the Whitewater probe. 
</P>
<P>
	In one note, the jurors asked whether they could consider her  
state of mind in deciding whether she is guilty of criminal 
contempt for not testifying to grand juries in 1996 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Other notes asked for a definition of ``innocent reason'' -- a  
phrase in written instructions for the jury -- and asked whether 
there might have been an ``innocent reason'' for refusing to 
testify, even if Mrs. McDougal acted ``willfully'' in violating a 
court order directing her to cooperate with Starr's probe. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, Howard tossed the question back to the jury,  
referring the panel to the instructions he had read to them. 
</P>
<P>
	During five days on the witness stand, Mrs. McDougal said she  
feared Starr would charge her with perjury unless she falsely 
implicated President Clinton and his wife in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	McDougal lawyer Mark Geragos said the jurors obviously ``are  
having trouble with the issues. That would lead me to believe they 
are split in some manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Barrett pointed to a jury instruction saying that Mrs.  
McDougal's possible belief that Starr was trying to get her to lie 
is not a defense against the criminal contempt charges. Jurors were 
instructed they could consider that defense only in deciding the 
third charge, obstruction of Starr's probe.

<HEADLINE> Gore Site Spawns High-Tech Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's attempt to speak  
nerd-talk to computer programmers has developed into a high-tech 
faux pas. 
</P>
<P>
	A message hidden in the programming code for Gore's presidential  
campaign Web site touts his support for sharing software codes. But 
the high tech aficionados who went looking behind the scenes found 
the entire site is built using products from Microsoft Corp. -- a 
company that refuses to share its programming code. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like he's saying he's all for buying American cars and  
then driving around in a Honda,'' said Jim Jagielski, a core 
developer of the Apache software that powers most Internet Web 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not hard for an Internet user to peek behind the scenes of  
Gore's Web site. Simply go on the World Wide Web to http://www.algore2000.com, 
choose ``View'' from the menu on top of the screen and click on 
``Source'' or ``Source Code.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly the tanned and happy image of Gore is replaced with  
this message: 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks for checking out our source code! ... The fact that you  
are peeking behind the scenes at our site means you can make an 
important difference to this Internet effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The site invites computer programmers to share their ideas about  
how to improve the Web site, ``in the spirit of the open-source 
movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Open source is a registered trademark referring to the free  
distribution of software codes. Gore's support of open source 
programming follows a growing movement in the high tech community 
to share and communally improve the codes behind software. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice defies Microsoft Corp.'s competitive practice of  
keeping its software source code private, so that it can surprise 
consumers with new developments. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux, for example, is an operating system that makes computers  
run, similar to Microsoft's Windows. But unlike Windows, anyone can 
download Linux code for free and develop it in new ways. Apache's 
Web server programming code is also made readily available. 
</P>
<P>
	John Witchell, a partner at USWeb who developed Gore's site,  
said Thursday that in reaction to input from Web site visitors, 
they are going to shift to a true open source operating system and 
server in about three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an honest initial attempt,'' said Witchell on  
Thursday. ``What you will soon see is a Web site that is widely 
respected in an open environment. We're going to get better and 
better at this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the first time in recent weeks that Gore has tripped  
up technically. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore drew ridicule from the high-tech community when he said in  
an interview that he helped create the Internet, a remark he later 
blamed on being tired. And just minutes before launching his 
campaign into cyberspace Tuesday, Gore's campaign staff rushed to 
remove questions from the Web site that asked children for their 
names, e-mail addresses and zip codes -- a practice soon to be 
outlawed on some Internet sites by legislation Congress approved 
last year.

<HEADLINE> Rich Taxpayers Reap More Rewards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When it comes to paying income taxes, it seems  
the rich indeed do get richer -- but only if they charge tax bills 
on their credit cards to rack up airline frequent flier miles and 
other rewards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest surprise we've had in the program is the people  
who want to pay more than $100,000,'' said Steve Johnson, senior 
vice president at U.S. Audiotex, a California company running the 
new credit card program for the Internal Revenue Service. ``They 
want the miles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time this year, people can call an Audiotex  
toll-free number -- 1-888-2PAYTAX -- to pay their federal income tax 
bills using an American Express, MasterCard or Discover card. Visa, 
the largest credit card issuer, is taking a wait-and-see approach 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though taxpayers must pay a service fee averaging 2.5  
percent to use plastic, interest is running high among some of the 
well-heeled who determine the airline miles or other rewards are 
worth the price. Some want to pay bills of $1 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you run the numbers, some of these people who have a  
payment due figure there's a benefit to it,'' said Bob Barr, 
assistant IRS commissioner for electronic taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the big tax charges are coming from American Express  
cardholders, because they have no preset spending limit, Johnson 
said. About 50 people have asked to pay seven-figure amounts, 
including one person who sought to pay a $9 million bill. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express spokeswoman Judy Tenzer said many cardholders  
are enrolled in the company's ``Membership Rewards'' program, which 
also has no limit and converts dollars charged into frequent flier 
miles and points for free products ranging from music CDs to pearl 
necklaces to vacations in such places as British Columbia, Costa 
Rica or Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they are using checks, they're not getting anything in  
return,'' Tenzer said. ``While the size of these charges may be 
surprising, there are so many different things you can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Express is accepting such charges on a case-by-case  
basis after talking with the cardholder. One concern is that 
someone could escape paying the tax by putting the amount on a 
card, then declaring bankruptcy, knowing credit card bills rank 
lower than Uncle Sam when bankruptcy courts determine which debts 
get paid first. 
</P>
<P>
	Some large tax payments have also been made with MasterCard,  
which is issued through a bank or other financial institution and 
does have credit limits. Spokeswoman Lisa Brzezinski said approval 
of large charges above the limits is up to the issuer, but many 
cards are linked to particular airlines or other merchants and also 
offer rewards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frequent flier miles is definitely one of the reasons,'' she  
said. ``I think there is a convenience factor as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through April 2, IRS had received 5,400 credit card payments  
averaging $1,445. In addition to the toll-free number, taxpayers 
using Intuit's TurboTax and MacIntax software can use Discover or 
other Novus cards to pay online through those programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Another new method of payment is direct debit from a bank  
account for people who file electronically. Through last Friday, 
33,000 taxpayers had chosen these direct payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr said the IRS expects many more taxpayers planning to use  
credit cards -- particularly those with large bills -- will pay their 
taxes between now and the midnight deadline next Thursday. One 
thing to keep in mind, he said, is that the toll-free number will 
be operating until midnight Hawaiian time -- giving East Coast 
taxpayers extra time to meet the IRS deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year, the IRS is likely to add other types of taxes that  
can be paid with credit cards, Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are having a wildly successful season both in electronic  
filing and electronic payments,'' he said. ``Our folks are looking 
seriously at some other tax options.''

<HEADLINE> Negro League Star Gene Benson Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Gene Benson, a charismatic outfielder who  
starred in the Negro Leagues in the 1940s and mentored a young 
Jackie Robinson before Robinson broke baseball's racial barrier, 
has died. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson, who played for over a decade in the Negro Leagues in the  
1930s and 40s, died Tuesday. He debuted with the Philadelphia Stars 
in 1937 before being traded to the Pittsburgh Crawfords in 1938. A 
year later, he returned to the Stars, where he played into the late 
1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson had his best years from 1944 to 1946, batting .327, .370,  
and .345, respectively, during those years. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include five grandchildren and six  
great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held Monday in 
Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Earnings Will Fall Short </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. braced investors for  
disappointing first-quarter earnings, disclosing that results would 
fall far short of analysts' estimates, in part because of 
industrywide price-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Compaq, the world's largest PC maker, said Friday  
that it anticipates reporting a profit of 15 cents a share on 
revenue of $9.4 billion for the quarter ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call had been predicting a profit of  
31 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quarter's shortfall reflects lower than anticipated market  
demand and increased competitive pricing in the commercial PC 
sector,'' Earl Mason, senior vice president and chief financial 
officer, said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Final results are to be released April 21.  
</P>
<P>
	``While market conditions will continue to be competitive, we  
fully intend to expand our business and grow market share 
profitably in 1999,'' said Eckhard Pfeiffer, president and Compaq's 
chief executive officer. ``The company will continue its aggressive 
drive of reduction of cost and operating expenses in the face of a 
very competitive market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The profit warning came in advance of the quarterly crush of  
earnings reports from U.S. companies and on a day when rising 
technology shares had lifted the Nasdaq composite index to its 
fourth record high of the week on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's announcement was made after the close of trading  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the announcement, Compaq shares rose more than 4  
percent on the New York Stock Exchange, or by $1.31 1/4, to close at 
$30.93 3/4.

<HEADLINE> Internet Hoax Sends Stock Soaring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As if there wasn't enough uncertainty in  
investing, along came the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A bogus report on PairGain Technologies posted this week on the  
World Wide Web boosted the company's stock price 31 percent before 
the story was debunked. It was a disturbing reminder of the power 
and peril of relying on online information to make decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street whispers are nothing new, but the growth of the  
Internet has allowed people to instantaneously spread word on a 
potentially hot stock. While that has helped foster an online 
investment boom, there's a downside. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Web means that scoundrels are able to disseminate  
fraudulent information far more widely and much more quickly,'' 
said John Delaney, co-chairman of the new media practice at 
Morrison &AMP; Foerster, a New York law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	No one yet knows the source or the motives behind the fake  
report on PairGain, which appeared early Wednesday on 
Angelfire.com, a site that allows surfers to create personal Web 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said PairGain, a Tustin, Calif., maker of  
telecommunications equipment, would be acquired by an Israeli firm, 
ECI Telecom, for $1.35 billion, or about twice its current market 
value. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders jumped on the hot tip, buying up shares and touting the  
stock in chat rooms run by Yahoo! The report appeared credible, 
with quotes from company officials, and the page was a near-perfect 
replica of the Web site run by financial news giant Bloomberg LP. 
</P>
<P>
	PairGain shares, which closed at $8.50 Tuesday, rose to more  
than $11 on Wednesday before company officials confirmed the report 
was untrue and the fake page was yanked from the Internet. The 
stock settled back to close at about $9 on volume of 13.7 million 
shares. On an average trading day, about 2 million shares of 
PairGain change hands. 
</P>
<P>
	PairGain and Bloomberg officials said Thursday that they had  
turned the matter over to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts said the perpetrator of the PairGain hoax could  
find himself charged with securities and wire fraud, and could face 
five to 30 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The losses to investors who took the bait are tough to tally.  
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of stock traders lamented the hoax in postings on  
investment chat rooms while a few chastised themselves for 
responding so quickly to the PairGain rumor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's raise our requirements for allowing ourselves to be  
impressed,'' wrote one trader. ``Criminality deserves no 
admiration,'' wrote another. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet rumors spread over the Internet have been the lifeblood of  
the growing ranks of day traders, who try to make quick profits 
from the twists and turns of corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
	And in chat rooms or message boards, thousands of anonymous  
traders encourage each other to buy, sell or hold. Chief executive 
officers, waitresses and teen-agers alike can log on and offer 
investment advice without ever disclosing their true identities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet has become the world's largest conference call,''  
said Anthony Elgindy, an online trader who runs Pacific Equity 
Investigations, a research firm. ``And plenty of the people talking 
about stocks have hidden motives for what they're saying.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Livestock producers in 31 states who suffered

<HEADLINE> Fighting Rages in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- A bitter artillery duel between  
Afghanistan's Taliban troops and opposition soldiers raged north of 
the capital before dawn today, putting into question a peace 
agreement negotiated last month. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kabul, the thud of incoming rockets reverberated, and at the  
front line soldiers of the Taliban religious army blamed their 
northern-based opponents for firing the first rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no choice but to defend ourselves,'' said a Taliban  
commander, who gave his name only as Habibullah. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no immediate reports of casualties.  
</P>
<P>
	Habibullah said the U.N.-negotiated peace process was a failure.  
With the onset of spring and improved weather, Habibullah said the 
fighting, which already has picked up, will intensify. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't trust the opposition ... their history in Afghanistan  
is very bad,'' he said from his bunker, 12 miles north of Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the United Nations got an agreement from both sides  
in the protracted civil war in Afghanistan to share power. More 
meetings were to be held this month in Pakistan or in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	But fighting has intensified on several fronts and both sides  
have stepped back from peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban rule about 90 percent of Afghanistan with an iron  
fist, imposing their harsh version of Islam. The opposition, which 
comprises mostly minority ethnic groups, controls the remaining 10 
percent of the Central Asian country. 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition, led by former President Burhanuddin Rabbani and  
his military chief Ahmed Shah Massood, say they won't accept 
Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar as head of a shared government. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N.'s special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi earlier warned that  
time was running out for negotiations, saying the warring groups 
were busily preparing for more fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban have come under heavy international criticism for  
their harsh edicts that have forced women off the job and girls out 
of school. Women are required to wear a burqa, a garment that 
covers their entire body, and can travel outside their home only 
when accompanied by a male relative. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibullah said schools for female students will open once there  
is peace in the country. ``The Taliban have promised that they will 
let girls go to school, but not until the fighting is finished,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE>  Teen Olympiad, Family End Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- After enormous success at a young age -- followed  
by a high-profile rift with her parents -- Olympic gold medalist 
Dominique Moceanu may have finally found peace. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old gymnast and her parents have reached a  
confidential financial settlement and ended a protective order 
against her father, the Houston Chronicle and The Dallas Morning 
News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an extremely difficult time for my family, and I  
hope that we can now begin to move forward in support of one 
another,'' Miss Moceanu said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that deep down my father loves me, and of course I love  
him, so I need to find a way in my heart to give him forgiveness. I 
hope there is a chance that someday things in my family can be 
normal again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, signed Thursday by Family Law Judge Patricia  
Lykos, was kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
	The family fight erupted publicly last October, when Miss  
Moceanu sued for her independence, saying her father, Dumitru 
Moceanu, had squandered the money she had earned in a 10-year 
professional career. She was declared a legal adult Oct. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Moceanu's parents placed her earnings in a trust fund,  
which they administer. She did not have access to the trust until 
she turned 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father has said all of his daughter's earnings went into  
building a 70,000-square-foot gym with Miss Moceanu's blessings. He 
has refused to say how much the gym cost, but his attorney 
Katherine Scardino said it was about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The gymnast sought and won a court order on Dec. 9 that kept her  
father at least 500 feet away after police said they were 
investigating Dumitru, 44, for allegedly trying to hire killers to 
murder two of his daughter's friends. He denied the allegation.

<HEADLINE> Boston Cabbie Didn't Win Big Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The city's richest cabbie may not be so rich after  
all. 
</P>
<P>
	The story going around Boston was that a Town Taxi cabbie  
identified by co-workers as ``Patrick,'' a Nigerian immigrant, won 
the $197 million Big Game jackpot, the second largest jackpot in 
United States lottery history. 
</P>
<P>
	But workers at Town Taxi said Friday the rumor was just that -- a  
rumor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick's lawyer made the announcement today,'' Jeff Cousins,  
a phone operator at Town Taxi, said Friday night. ``All we heard 
was that he didn't win it after all. We still haven't been able to 
get a hold of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Men who identified themselves as attorneys for Patrick -- Dane  
Schulman and John Ricci -- told television stations that the cabbie 
had in fact not won and wanted to be left alone. Neither Schulman 
nor Ricci returned phone messages Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The drawing was Tuesday night, and word spread quickly that the  
cab driver had won. 
</P>
<P>
	Since February, 328 million tickets were sold in the Big Game  
states -- Massachusetts, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan and 
Virginia, with no one winning the twice-a-week drawing until 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Rules Proposed for Cell Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Government advisers have proposed new  
guidelines to oversee federal financing of controversial research 
on cells taken from human embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal drafted by a 13-member committee would allow the  
National Institutes of Health to pay for research on ``master 
cells'' only if researchers adhered to strict guidelines that would 
control how the cells were obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	The cells, called pluripotent stem cells, are the building  
blocks for nearly all of the tissues in the body and are capable of 
growing virtually any human tissue. Researchers believe they can 
learn how to use the cells to make body parts or to correct some 
disorders, such as Parkinson's disease or diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	The cells, however, can only be obtained from human embryos or  
from very early fetuses. A federal law bans government funding of 
embryo research and severely restricts fetal research. At least 75 
members of Congress have said stem cells taken from human embryos 
are covered by the ban. Some religious organization also are 
opposed to the research. 
</P>
<P>
	Two privately funded researchers recently isolated pluripotent  
stem cells. NIH director Harold Varmus has proposed that these 
existing stem cell cultures are not covered by the ban because 
federal funds were not used to create them. 
</P>
<P>
	Varmus selected the committee to draw up rules to guide NIH  
should the agency decide to fund pluripotent stem cell research. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed guidelines made public Thursday, federal  
grants would be forbidden to researchers who propose, as part of 
their research, to create or destroy a human embryo. Because 
removing stem cells kills an embryo, this would prohibit federal 
funding for creating new cultures of embryonic stem cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rules also would forbid federal funding of research  
into the cloning of humans, or research that would create an embryo 
using stem cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, however, would permit federal support of research  
using existing stem cell cultures created by privately funded 
scientists, such as the two stem cell lines created recently. 
</P>
<P>
	New embryonic stem cell cultures could be used in federal  
research, the rules state, only if privately funded scientists 
obtained the cells from embryos that had been created for 
infertility treatment and were ``in excess of clinical need.''

	Use of pluripotent stem cells from embryos created for research  
purposes also are forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
	Stem cells from fetuses can be used, the rules say, if they are  
obtained ``after a spontaneous abortion or induced abortion or 
after a stillbirth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory committee also recommended a strict process of  
informed consent requiring that donors of fetal tissue or embryos 
be told about the potential use of the specimens. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed system, a stem cell research grant  
application would be considered first by an NIH science committee. 
If that group approves, then an oversight committee would determine 
if the proposal complies with the guidelines. Only then could the 
grant be considered for final approval.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Must Pay $909M to Thrift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government owes a California savings and  
loan $909 million for a 1989 federal rule change that put the S&AMP;L 
in financial trouble, and many other thrift institutions hope for 
similar court-ordered damage awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Judge Loren Smith of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims  
ordered the government Friday to pay the money to Glendale Federal 
Bank for breach of contract. Glendale had hoped for an award of $1 
billion to $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling stems from a 1996 Supreme Court decision that the  
government broke its contract with Glendale and two other thrifts 
when it changed the rules on how they must count their assets. The 
justices said the government could be forced to pay damages to the 
S&AMP;Ls for their financial harm. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar damage claims have been filed against the government by  
about 125 other thrifts, many of which were declared insolvent 
after the 1989 rule change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Restitution provides a remedy, and a fair one,'' Smith's  
decision said. ``The government received a very significant benefit 
in 1981'' when Glendale took over an ailing Florida S&AMP;L. The 
government ``then failed to honor its promise to Glendale upon 
which the contract was premised,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one should be surprised that this decision affirms that the  
government must honor the contracts it makes,'' said Glendale's 
lawyer, Ronald Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said, ``We remain confident in our  
position and look forward to a fair and expeditious final 
resolution'' of the S&AMP;L cases. Privately, Justice lawyers said they 
were pleased the judge did not award the full $2 billion Glendale 
had sought. 
</P>
<P>
	The Glendale case was the first to reach a judge's decision on  
how much the government must pay, and it was being closely watched 
for the standards it might set for assessing the other thrifts' 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Some S&AMP;Ls who sued the government have reached financial  
settlements, and Smith's opinion urged all sides in the remaining 
cases to pursue settlements instead of expensive litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington lawyer Charles Cooper, who represents 15 S&AMP;Ls and  
also has settled three cases, said Friday he was ``very 
enthusiastic about the bottom line'' in Smith's ruling. Cooper 
argued the case that led to the Supreme Court's 1996 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1989 accounting rule change was part of the government's  
effort to rescue the then-troubled thrift industry -- a cleanup that 
overall has cost about $200 billion. The S&AMP;L cleanup law passed by 
Congress and signed by President Bush tightened rules and provided 
money to close insolvent S&AMP;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, the government had encouraged healthy thrifts to  
take over insolvent ones by letting them count the insolvent S&AMP;Ls' 
losses as ``goodwill'' assets. The rule change said S&AMP;Ls no longer 
could count such assets toward their minimum capital requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Many previously healthy S&AMP;Ls were forced into the red. Among  
them was Glendale, which had taken over a troubled thrift and 
counted $734 million as goodwill assets. After the rule change, 
Glendale had to raise about $450 million to meet its capital 
minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	The government insisted to the Supreme Court that it never  
promised the S&AMP;Ls they would be protected from rule changes. But 
the justices decided otherwise in a 7-2 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Glendale's case then returned to Smith to set the amount of  
damages. The government argued it owed none, while the S&AMP;L's 
lawyers contended Glendale was entitled to recover all the profits 
it would have made if the rules had not changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Glendale's calculation of lost profits was ``too  
remote and speculative.'' Instead, he calculated the damages as 
restitution and to compensate the S&AMP;L for damage caused when it 
fell below the capital minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge had sharp words for the government, saying that during  
the S&AMP;L crisis it had ``no rational, sustained resolution strategy 
in place'' but dealt with problems as they arose. 
</P>
<P>
	Glendale has since merged with California Federal Bank, which is  
owned by Golden State Bancorp of San Francisco.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO unleashed wide-ranging  
airstrikes against Yugoslavia on Orthodox Good Friday today, with 
fiery hits on an oil depot and a weapons complex containing the 
factory that makes the Yugo car. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest wave of NATO attacks, mounted late Thursday and  
today, came despite a Yugoslav declaration that its 14-month 
crackdown in Kosovo is over. They also coincided with a former 
Cyprus president's mission to win the release of three U.S. 
soldiers held by Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO leaders, meanwhile, reaffirmed the bombing campaign would  
continue until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepts 
Western terms for a Kosovo peace agreement. They also warned 
Milosevic he will be held accountable for alleged atrocities 
committed against ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest wave of allied attacks targeted military-industrial  
plants, fuel depots and communications facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	A huge fireball exploded early today at the Jugopetrol storage  
depot at Smederevo, 20 miles east of the Yugoslav capital of 
Belgrade, the state-run Tanjug news agency said. Dense black smoke 
engulfed nearby vineyards and fruit orchards in spring bloom. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO jets struck twice late Thursday and early today at several  
targets in Kragujevac, an industrial town 55 miles south of 
Belgrade, targeting the Zastava industrial complex, Tanjug said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sprawling facility contains a major weapons factory and the  
country's only auto plant that makes Yugoslavia's trademark small, 
boxy Yugo cars, which had an unsuccessful run in the United States 
in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no word on whether the automaking part of the facility  
was affected. Tanjug said the complex's ``most vital'' 
installations were hit including a power plant it said provided 
heat for hospitals and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Other attacks were reported near a Serbian television relay  
station near Jagodina and along an electric power relay system near 
Valjevo, 15 miles south of here. NATO had threatened to go after 
Serbian television sites for allegedly spreading lies and 
propaganda about the air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent Beta news agency also reported NATO struck  
targets early today in Bubanj Potok, a garrison district in the 
southeastern part of Belgrade. And Studio B television said NATO 
planes were ``active'' early today over the capital and around two 
towns, Uzice and Pozega, 60 miles to the south. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressing ahead with his bid to win the freedom of the three  
Americans seized March 31 along the Macedonian border, Cypriot 
Spyros Kyprianou was expected to meet Milosevic later today. He 
left first for a visit to the coal-mining town of Aleksinac, where 
a NATO airstrike gone awry reportedly killed 12 civilians earlier 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyprianou, president of the Cyprus Parliament and the country's  
acting president, had called on NATO to observe a cease-fire over 
the Orthodox Christian holiday, something the alliance has refused 
to do. NATO had arranged for safe passage for Kyprianou's flight, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice Premier Vojislav Seselj, leader of the influential Serbian  
Radical Party, had told reporters Thursday that releasing the 
Americans was ``out of the question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Cyprus' efforts to secure the men's release,  
President Clinton said Thursday, ``I would be for anything 
honorable that would secure their release.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said only an  
unconditional release would be acceptable. ``Any attempt to use 
this as a bargaining chip is both illegal and immoral,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav authorities also confirmed they are holding two  
Australian aid workers who have been missing for more than a week, 
Australia said. It has demanded their immediate release. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Thursday, Milosevic's government claimed its  
crackdown on the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army was over and 
that ``peace has prevailed'' in Kosovo, a majority ethnic Albanian 
province of Yugoslavia's main republic, Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Yugoslav government once again calls on all citizens of  
Kosovo not to leave their country, to live in harmony and 
cooperation, and in that way resist the bombs that kill regardless 
of nationality,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO says the bombing campaign will continue until Milosevic  
withdraws Serb special police and Yugoslav army units sent to 
Kosovo as part of the crackdown. He must also allow all ethnic 
Albanian refugees to return to their homes and accept a peace plan 
calling for 28,000 NATO-led troops, including 4,000 Americans, to 
enforce a peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of NATO's military committee said today it would be  
``very, very difficult'' for the West to impose peace in Kosovo 
without sending in ground troops. Gen. Klaus Naumann said 
deployment inside the province was a ``theoretical possibility'' 
but refused to speculate on what the alliance would decide. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin said today that if NATO sends in ground  
troops, it could prompt a stronger response from Russia. ``We 
cannot permit that,'' Yeltsin said in the Kremlin, according to the 
Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian leader has said repeatedly that his country will not  
be drawn into the Yugoslav conflict militarily, but added that NATO 
ground forces could change the equation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a half-million ethnic Albanians have fled or were driven  
out of Kosovo since the NATO bombing campaign began March 24, 
unleashing Europe's greatest mass displacement in half a century. 
</P>
<P>
	Those reaching refuge in neighboring states have described a  
systematic campaign of terror by Serb troops and police against 
ethnic Albanians, who made up 90 percent of the Serbian province's 
prewar population of 2 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Western officials say their air armada is also stepping up  
attacks on Serb police and army units scattered in rural areas of 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Small Yugoslav units have been blamed for most of the atrocities  
against ethnic Albanians. Targeting them in the hills and forests 
of the largely rural province has proven difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	However, NATO airstrikes on roads and bridges in Kosovo are  
hampering the ability of Serb forces to move around, according to 
accounts Thursday by French journalists who entered western Kosovo 
with KLA fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a Macedonian soldier was found dead on the  
Kosovo-Macedonian border near Blace. The Macedonian Defense 
Ministry said circumstances were unclear and it was investigating.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Picks European Tariff Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lovers of Scottish cashmere sweaters can  
rejoice. But Americans with a hankering for French handbags weren't 
so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States published its final hit list Friday of  
European products that will be subject to 100 percent tariffs 
designed to eliminate those goods from American store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	The retaliation list is part of a nasty trade fight between the  
United States and the 15-nation European Union over bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration said French handbags still will be  
targeted as part of a total sanction list of $191.4 million in 
European products. But a number of goods were removed from a 
much-larger initial list that had covered $520 million in European 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to cashmere sweaters, other items removed from the  
original target list were cookies from Britain, European pork 
products, Italian pecorino cheese and candles. 
</P>
<P>
	Decisions on what to include and exclude were based on a need to  
trim the sanctions amount to confirm with a ruling this week by the 
World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	A WTO arbitration panel ruled that America's higher claim of  
$520 million in harm being done to U.S. banana companies was 
excessive and put the actual amount of lost sales annually at the 
$191.4 million figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Since March 3, the administration has been requiring importers  
to post bonds that would cover 100 percent tariffs on the larger 
target list, but officials said all along that they would refund 
any amounts that were not allowed by the WTO panel. 
</P>
<P>
	European officials have complained that mere publication of the  
list had a chilling effect on the their companies' ability to sell 
into the U.S. market. American importers started canceling orders 
in the fear that they could be stuck with goods that could not be 
sold because the threatened 100 percent tariffs had doubled their 
prices in the American market. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision on what goods to include and exclude was made on  
the basis of the need to reduce the total damage amount and also 
represented an attempt to equalize the economic pain among targeted 
countries, U.S. officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to handbags, other consumer items still on the  
target list include coffee makers and tea pots, except those made 
in Italy; lithographs printed not more than 20 years ago; bed 
linens; bath preparations; and electric batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to these items, the list included cardboard packing  
cartons and uncoated felt paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Helaine Klaskey, a spokeswoman for U.S. Trade Representative  
Charlene Barshefsky, said the decision was made to exclude coffee 
makers from Italy because that country already had a number of 
items on the hit list. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the 15 EU nations, Denmark and the Netherlands, always  
have been excluded from the target list because they have urged the 
EU to agree to U.S. demands in the banana fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The $191.4 million in targeted products equals the amount the  
WTO set as the level of lost sales by two American banana 
companies, Chiquita and Dole, because of European banana import 
restrictions that the WTO has ruled violate global trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
	EU spokeswoman Ella Krucoff said European officials are weighing  
the possibility of appealing the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The banana fight is one of two trade disputes in which the  
United States is threatening to impose punitive tariffs against 
Europe. The other involves a European ban on American beef 
containing growth hormones.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Baby? It's Conceivable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Around the world, couples trying to have a ``millennium baby''  
did everything conceivable today. 
</P>
<P>
	From Malaysia to Norway, from Spain to the United States, radio  
stations held first-baby-of-2000 contests, and couples were offered 
some private time together, romantic hotel getaways and 
aphrodisiacs ranging from a traditional Malaysian potion to a Barry 
White CD. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday was considered the optimum conception date for a Jan. 1,  
2000, birth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it's normally not so public,'' said Saundra Mendalka,  
who participated in a Boston radio station's ``conceive-a-thon'' 
with her husband, Darren. ``I called my mother and I said, `How 
does it feel to have a daughter that's going to be in the public 
and everybody knows that she's going to have sex tomorrow?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Diana and Michael Maurer accepted a Philadelphia radio station's  
offer of a free hotel room. Mrs. Maurer said afterward: ``We gave 
it a good go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A radio host in Barcelona, Spain, wore pajamas as he interviewed  
his station's two competing couples in a king-size bed hours before 
they went in search of parenthood in their free hotel suites. 
</P>
<P>
	One couple -- a Russian man and a Spanish woman -- was selected  
for saying a mixed-culture baby in 2000 will foster international 
harmony. The other couple reasoned that it would be easy to 
remember how old the kid is. 
</P>
<P>
	A hotel on the resort island of Penang in Malaysia helped out  
with a native elixir. ``We're serving a freshly brewed pot of 
tongkat ali. It's our Malaysian version of Viagra,'' said Cheah Mei 
Lin, an assistant manager at the Feringgi Beach Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal employees in Kautokaino, Norway, were given the  
morning off Friday so they could use the time reproductively. 
``This is a big joint effort for our town and I expect everyone to 
do their very best,'' Mayor Anton Dahl told the newspaper Verdens 
Gang. 
</P>
<P>
	In the township of Sel, in the mountains of Norway, nursery  
schools are staying open this weekend to look after children for 
free so that their parents can try to conceive in peace. 
</P>
<P>
	In Romania, the newspaper Evenimentul urged readers to ``get to  
work'' and promised the equivalent of seven years' average wages -- 
$6,800 -- to the country's first baby next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Independent Television network planned to show a  
two-hour program called ``Birth Race 2000'' on Saturday that 
included tips on conception and romantic movies. 
</P>
<P>
	All this activity worries some.  
</P>
<P>
	A January 2000 baby boom could overload maternity clinics at a  
time of possible staff shortages and equipment failures because of 
Y2K computer problems when the year rolls from '99 to '00. 
</P>
<P>
	While many said Friday was the best day to conceive a Jan. 1,  
2000 baby, Dr. Timothy Cathey said that a conception that takes 
places anytime between April 3 and April 17 has a chance of 
producing the millennium baby. That's because babies make their 
first appearances when they -- and not necessarily their parents -- 
are ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wouldn't be unusual for a baby conceived as late as May 1st  
to be the millennium baby,'' the McAlester, Okla., obstetrician 
said. ``It's an inexact science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for those who really, really want to have a millennium baby,  
he gave this advice: ``Don't give up, there's still time.''

<HEADLINE> Health Funds Can't Sue Big Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two union health funds seeking to force the  
tobacco industry to reimburse them for smoking-related injuries to 
their customers cannot proceed with a lawsuit, a federal appeals 
court ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan  
was the second appeals court decision to bar union health funds 
from recovering money from the tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia reached  
the same conclusion March 29 in a lawsuit filed by seven 
Pennsylvania union health funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris lawyer Steven B. Rissman said the two appeals  
court rulings and victories in other courts should help halt a wave 
of health similar lawsuits spawned by a group of contigency-fee 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They bet that the federal courts would disregard established  
law merely because the politically vilified tobacco industry was 
the defendant,'' Rissman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the New York case, the funds for two unions representing  
several thousand workers filed a lawsuit in 1997 to recover money 
they spent on tobacco-related illnesses. Four welfare trust funds 
later joined the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ruled that the health  
funds had proven they deserved reimbursement if a jury found the 
tobacco industry to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court disagreed, saying the union funds were  
essentially suing for damages suffered by their customers, who 
could file lawsuits on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert J. Connerton, a lawyer for the union funds, said he did  
not yet know whether they would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in Kentucky, a tobacco company has unveiled a Web  
site that acknowledges the health risks associated with smoking in 
its strongest language ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. Web site, which debuted  
this week, also offers advice to kick the habit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brown &AMP; Williamson believes that people who choose to smoke  
are taking significant health risks,'' says the Web site for the 
Louisville-based company, maker of Kool and Lucky Strike 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	But tobacco critics dismissed it as a smokescreen intended to  
shield the nation's third-largest tobacco company from future 
liability lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	John Garrison, chief executive officer of the American Lung  
Association, said the Web site was a ``cruel hoax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very clever defensive maneuver to try to make  
themselves less liable as future lawsuits arrive,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dell To Push Low-Cost PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. plans to expand its presence  
in the low-cost home computer market, offsetting the lower profit 
margin on those machines by selling more add-on products and 
services, the company told Wall Street analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	The company began selling sub-$1,000 home PCs last month and  
plans to have ``much more presence and aggressiveness in those 
lower-priced'' products, said Paul Bell, senior vice president for 
Dell. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it will increasingly offer printers, leasing  
plans and extended warranties, to keep the lower-priced machines 
from lowering profit, The Wall Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said early sales of Dell's $999 PC have been ``very  
solid.'' It began offering the low-cost model after deciding some 
buyers wouldn't consider Dell products because of price, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival computer makers first began selling machines at that price  
two years ago, and now sell some machines for $599. Dell accounts 
for 5 percent of worldwide home-PC sales but has seen the business 
expand rapidly in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell's recent embrace of under-$1,000 PCs continues the  
company's practice of avoiding first-time PC buyers, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dell is following the appropriate strategy,'' Warburg Dillon  
Read analyst Charles R. Wolf told the Journal. ``There's no 
advantage to being a first mover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Round Rock, Texas-based PC maker traditionally has sold  
higher-priced and performance machines to sophisticated buyers. 
Most of its home and small-business PCs have been sold for between 
$2,500 and $2,999, Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	After falling short of Wall Street revenue projections in the  
fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan. 29, Wall Street has expected the 
company to use pricing to lift sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell will also expand its services on the Internet to lower its  
service costs, the Journal reported. Chief Executive Michael S. 
Dell said the company estimates it costs $3 to $8 for every call 
made to its technical-support center. It recently began offering 
self-help aids and encouraging customers to exchange technical 
information on its Web site. The Internet aids have reduced the 
number of phone calls 25 percent, Dell said.

<HEADLINE> Subaru Recalls Foresters, Legacys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- Subaru of America Inc. is recalling  
approximately 221,000 of its 1998-99 Forester and Legacy vehicles -- 
including Outback models -- due to a potential brake malfunction in 
extremely cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the voluntary recall Friday, the company said no  
accidents or injuries had been reported as a result of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Subaru said an internal valve in the brake master cylinder can  
momentarily be stuck in the open position during normal braking at 
temperatures of minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit and below. If that 
happens, the vehicle slows but does not stop right away, Subaru 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorists who experience this problem can correct it by  
releasing the brake pedal and stepping on it sharply one time, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, about 40 Subaru vehicles in Alaska and Canada have been  
determined to have the problem, said Subaru spokesman Richard 
Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
	All registered owners of the vehicles affected will be notified  
of the recall by mail and asked to arrange an inspection at a 
Subaru dealer. Notices will go to owners in cold-weather areas 
first, officials said. Subaru will pay any inspection and 
replacement costs, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall does not affect 2.2-liter Legacy models, the  
Brighton, L and Postal Legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Subaru of America is a subsidiary of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.  
of Japan. Legacy models sold in the United States are produced at 
the Subaru-Isuzu Automotive plant near Lafayette, Ind.

<HEADLINE> Evel Knievel Back in Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A week ago, Evel Knievel was in a posh Strip  
resort, talking about his liver transplant giving him a new lease 
on life. 
</P>
<P>
	Today he was back in the hospital, talking about the liver  
possibly being rejected and what fate might have in store for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel, 60, received a life-saving liver transplant in Tampa,  
Fla., two months ago. He said he had been waiting for a new liver 
to replace one wracked by hepatitis C he says was caused by years 
of blood transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors were still trying to determine whether the liver had  
been rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my body is rejecting the liver or my hepatitis C is  
coming back and overtaking my liver,'' Knievel said, speaking 
softly from his bed at Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center. ``I've 
been feeling weak and dizzy and tired.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Acknowledges Collateral Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO acknowledged today that one of its  
bombs from an attack on the main telephone exchange in Kosovo's 
capital fell short of its target, damaging a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the errant bomb, the alliance made clear NATO will stick  
with airstrikes -- for now. 
</P>
<P>
	It reassured Russia it had no plans of sending ground troops  
into Kosovo, responding to a warning by President Boris Yeltsin 
Friday it could prompt ``a European war or even a world war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with Associated Press Television News, U.S. Gen.  
Wesley Clark, NATO's top military commander in Europe, said, ``We 
have a mission to conduct and that is the air mission (and we'll) 
do the best job we can with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that what we're are doing at the moment, presents  
no threat -- not even in the most remote sense -- to the security of 
Russia,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Air Commodore David Wilby said allied bombing was  
not to blame for the widespread damage in Pristina, claiming 
instead it was probably orchestrated by the Serbs. On Friday, he 
admitted a NATO bomb had inflicted collateral damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Close inspection of imagery indicates that it landed some 200  
to 300 meters away in what seems to be a small residential area,'' 
Wilby told reporters at NATO headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we regret any unintended damage or loss of civilian  
life,'' he said as NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia entered their 
third week. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the possible harm to non-military targets, ``our  
operations are not responsible for the widespread random damage 
that has been reported throughout the city,'' Wilby insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Yeltsin warned NATO not to send ground troops into  
Yugoslavia and ``make it their protectorate. I have already told 
NATO, Americans and Germans, `Don't push us to military action, 
since that will certainly lead to a European war or even a world 
war, which is inadmissible,''' Yeltsin said in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a development could prompt a stronger response from Russia  
but Yeltsin didn't specify what steps could be taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can reassure Russia that NATO is not planning some kind of  
invasion,'' Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's latest targets in and around Pristina included a  
telephone exchange, a gasoline storage, a paramilitary unit 
headquarters and an army facility. Another target was what Serbs 
had described a car plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our intelligence says it's not a car plant but it produces  
military machinery,'' Wilby said, declining to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-member alliance had suffered no loss of planes, he added.  
</P>
<P>
	The bad weather that hampered operations for much of the first  
two weeks, then broke briefly, was back, making NATO's work more 
difficult, both conducting airstrikes but also viewing the damages 
caused on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	In the APTN interview, Clark maintained airstrikes were taking  
their toll despite the television pictures of residents in the 
capital of Belgrade attending rock concerts and pro-Milosevic 
rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	`There have to be a lot of people (in Serbia) asking themselves  
what this is really all about,'' said Clark. ``They are seeing it 
every night on the skyline of Belgrade.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Major Airlines Hike Air Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Some of the nation's largest airlines raised  
leisure fares 3 percent and walkup fares 1 percent on Friday, 
signaling what could be the industry's third increase this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental Airlines was the first to increase fares, a move  
that was quickly matched by Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. It 
was unclear whether American Airlines, Northwest Airlines and US 
Airways would follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	United spokesman Joe Hopkins said the Chicago-based carrier  
doesn't automatically raise fares to follow a competitor, but ``we 
have to make a judgment on each case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for American Airlines said he did not know whether  
the airline would match the increase. Calls to other American 
spokespeople were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest and US Airways did not immediately raise fares, which  
could prove to be a key factor in determining whether the increases 
stick at the other airlines, said Tom Parsons, who operates the 
consumer Web site Bestfares.com. 
</P>
<P>
	When Northwest failed to go along with four of the six increases  
by rivals earlier this year, the other airlines quickly dropped 
back, cutting their fares to stay competitive. Likewise, 
Northwest's reluctance to raise fares last year thwarted attempts 
to implement increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they elect not to do it,'' Parsons predicted, ``the others  
won't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two fare hikes that did succeed this year have already  
raised leisure fares by 7 percent and business fares 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	If this one sticks, that will mean a 10 percent air fare  
increase in the first four months of the year. Since 1992, Parsons 
says, carriers have increased prices by as much as 18 percent in a 
single year. 
</P>
<P>
	By Parson's calculation, carriers are attempting to raise prices  
once every four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this was done with milk or gas or bread ... we would call  
that price fixing, but the airlines get away with it,'' Parsons 
said. ``All this is to impress their stockholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts attribute the price increases to a thriving economy  
that has boosted demand to record levels for many carriers. Also, a 
recent rebound from last year's plunge in fuel prices has made it 
more expensive for airlines to fly their planes. 
</P>
<P>
	At United, for example, the fuel tab runs to about $5 million a  
day, and a one-cent increase in per-barrel oil prices has a $30 
million annual impact, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a weekly fare newsletter, BT Alex Brown Inc. said the average  
business fare this week was up 6 percent over the same period last 
year.

	Russian: Missiles Targeted at NATO  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's parliament speaker claimed today that  
President Boris Yeltsin has ordered Russian strategic missiles be 
targeted at NATO nations because of airstrikes against Yugoslavia. 
The Kremlin refused to comment on the report. Parliament speaker 
Gennady Seleznyov met Yeltsin today and told the Interfax news 
agency that the president had given the order to aim missiles at 
NATO countries. But the chief of staff of the Strategic Missile 
Forces, Col. Gen. Anatoly Perminov, said no such order had been 
received, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Seleznyov said he 
plans to call Yeltsin and find out why their discussion about the 
missiles had not been announced publicly.

take in the refugees -- now numbering 105,000 in Macedonia and 
320,000 in Albania. A spokesman said the UNHCR has now accounted

</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Four Massachusetts couples are in separate rooms  
in a Boston hotel today, competing to conceive the nation's first 
baby of 2000. Today is considered the optimal conception day for a 
Jan. 1, 2000 birth. If one of the couples bears the first baby born 
in the United States next year, the parents will receive a check 
for $1 million, courtesy of radio station WJMN. Any birth must be 
natural -- no Caesarean sections or inducements allowed. The odds 
against the aspiring parents are long. Obstetricians warn that 
babies arrive when they want over a period of weeks, not seconds.

	31 Acts Announced for Woodstock '99  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Woodstock '99 promoters have announced a 31-act  
lineup geared to teens and 20-year-olds that, so far at least, 
doesn't include one performer from the namesake festival in 1969. 
The Dave Matthews Band, Jewel, Metallica and Alanis Morissette are 
this year's headliners for the three-day show, scheduled for July 
23-25. It will be held at Griffiss Park, an abandoned Air Force 
base in Rome, N.Y., about 50 miles west of Albany. ``Three more 
days of mud, noise and logistical nightmares?'' said Metallica 
drummer Lars Ulrich. ``Wouldn't miss it for the world.''

	Producer Prices Rise 0.2 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices paid to producers such as factories and  
refineries rose a mild 0.2 percent in March but the largest 
increase in crude oil costs since the Gulf War signaled faster 
inflation ahead. The seasonally adjusted increase in the Labor 
Department's Producer Price Index for finished goods brought the 
annual rate of inflation at the wholesale level to 1.5 percent so 
far in 1999, compared with a tiny 0.1 percent price decline for all 
of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Gore Site Spawns High-Tech Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's attempt to speak  
nerd-talk to computer programmers has developed into a high-tech 
faux pas. 
</P>
<P>
	A message hidden in the programming code for Gore's presidential  
campaign Web site touts his support for sharing software codes. But 
the high tech aficionados who went looking behind the scenes found 
the entire site is built using products from Microsoft Corp. -- a 
company that refuses to share its programming code. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like he's saying he's all for buying American cars and  
then driving around in a Honda,'' said Jim Jagielski, a core 
developer of the Apache software that powers most Internet Web 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not hard for an Internet user to peek behind the scenes of  
Gore's Web site. Simply go on the World Wide Web to http://www.algore2000.com, 
choose ``View'' from the menu on top of the screen and click on 
``Source'' or ``Source Code.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly the tanned and happy image of Gore is replaced with  
this message: 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks for checking out our source code! ... The fact that you  
are peeking behind the scenes at our site means you can make an 
important difference to this Internet effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The site invites computer programmers to share their ideas about  
how to improve the Web site, ``in the spirit of the open-source 
movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Open source is a registered trademark referring to the free  
distribution of software codes. Gore's support of open source 
programming follows a growing movement in the high tech community 
to share and communally improve the codes behind software. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice defies Microsoft Corp.'s competitive practice of  
keeping its software source code private, so that it can surprise 
consumers with new developments. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux, for example, is an operating system that makes computers  
run, similar to Microsoft's Windows. But unlike Windows, anyone can 
download Linux code for free and develop it in new ways. Apache's 
Web server programming code is also made readily available. 
</P>
<P>
	John Witchell, a partner at USWeb who developed Gore's site,  
said Thursday that in reaction to input from Web site visitors, 
they are going to shift to a true open source operating system and 
server in about three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an honest initial attempt,'' said Witchell on  
Thursday. ``What you will soon see is a Web site that is widely 
respected in an open environment. We're going to get better and 
better at this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the first time in recent weeks that Gore has tripped  
up technically. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore drew ridicule from the high-tech community when he said in  
an interview that he helped create the Internet, a remark he later 
blamed on being tired. And just minutes before launching his 
campaign into cyberspace Tuesday, Gore's campaign staff rushed to 
remove questions from the Web site that asked children for their 
names, e-mail addresses and zip codes -- a practice soon to be 
outlawed on some Internet sites by legislation Congress approved 
last year.

<HEADLINE> Producer Prices Rise 0.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices charged by factories and other  
producers remained tame in March, but the biggest increase in crude 
oil costs since the Gulf War signaled a temporary burst of 
inflation in the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department's Producer Price Index for finished goods  
rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent, bringing the annualized 
rate of increase for the first three months of 1999 to 1.5 percent, 
the Labor Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The unexpectedly mild report reassured Wall Street that any  
interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve is still months 
away. The Dow Jones average of industrial stocks held near 
Thursday's record close, slipping only 24 points to 10,174. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inflation remains dead,'' said economist Stan Shipley of  
Merrill Lynch. ``It will ... help keep the Fed on hold despite 
strong economic growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, prices of finished energy goods jumped sharply in  
March, by 1.2 percent, with gasoline rising 3.5 percent, heating 
oil soaring 13.1 percent -- the most in five years, residential 
electricity edging 0.2 percent higher and natural gas falling 1.8 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans face even sharper energy increases in the months  
ahead, especially if last month's pact among members of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries holds up. Crude 
petroleum jumped 27.1 percent in March, the biggest increase since 
October 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first impact of the agreement by oil producers to limit  
production is apparent,'' said economist Donald Ratajczak of 
Georgia State University. ``Further gains are likely next month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question is whether higher energy costs will work their way  
through the price chain, resulting in any significant acceleration 
in overall consumer price inflation, which last year sank to a 
12-year low of 1.6 percent. So far the judgment of most analysts is 
``no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While inflation can pick up -- and it may pick up to 2.5  
percent -- the days of 4-, 5-, 6-percent inflation look to be long 
gone,'' said economic consultant Joel Naroff of Holland, Pa. ``It's 
going to take a lot more than just oil prices to create real 
inflation problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the volatile food and energy components, prices were  
unchanged in March for the second consecutive month. That reflects 
pressure on domestic producers to compete with cheaply priced 
imports. Auto prices, for instance, fell 0.5 percent in March and 
household appliances, 1.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American economy has found a vaccination for the inflation  
bug in the form of higher productivity and international 
competition,'' said economist David Huether of the National 
Association of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Food costs paid by wholesalers rose a moderate 0.4 percent last  
month. Fruit prices fell 5.5 percent, reflecting an 18.5 percent 
drop for navel oranges and 5.9 percent for golden delicious apples. 
</P>
<P>
	However, vegetable prices soared 20.2 percent, the most in eight  
months, reflecting increases of 115.5 percent for eggplant, 67.9 
percent for corn, 67.1 percent for lettuce and 45.4 percent for 
tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fish prices jumped 9.4 percent, the largest rise in nearly 13  
years. Pork and beef rose, too. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, at earlier stages of the production process, prices  
rose 0.3 percent for intermediate goods and 1 percent for crude 
goods. An example of the three stages is bread for finished, flour 
for intermediate and wheat for crude.

<HEADLINE> Six Dead in Midwest, Plains Storms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Powerful storms swept across the Plains and Midwest, destroying  
homes and downing power lines in several states and killing at 
least six people. The Cincinnati area was particularly hard-hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Entire blocks were destroyed as strong thunderstorms moved  
through before dawn today in the southwest Ohio city's upscale 
suburbs of Blue Ash and Montgomery. Roofs were torn off stores in 
shopping centers, and water spewed into the air from broken fire 
hydrants. Towering trees were uprooted or snapped off. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Emergency Management Agency estimated 200 homes were  
destroyed in Cincinnati's northeast suburbs in Hamilton County. The 
storm also damaged houses in a western Ohio county and flipped 
campers at a dealership near Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people in the area were killed in a house, and two in  
separate car crashes, Hamilton County Coroner Carl L. Parrott said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	One death was on Interstate 71 northeast of the city, where the  
wind picked up a car and threw it into a retaining wall, killing a 
40-year-old man, Blue Ash police Chief Mike Allen said. There were 
so many accidents and so much debris along the highway that it was 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 31 people went to hospitals, most for treatment of cuts  
and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessica Brown, 36, of Montgomery was awakened by her 12-year-old  
son. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I heard the winds and felt bricks and things falling on  
me over the blanket,'' Mrs. Brown said. They fled to the basement. 
The rest of the house was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to rent an apartment,'' said Jill Cole of  
Montgomery, whose house also was destroyed. ``I think it's a 
bulldozer job. ... It's like a war zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Cross set up an aid station at a junior high school, and  
police went door-to-door checking on people. An estimated 200,000 
customers lost electrical power around the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the line in southeastern Indiana, a woman was injured  
when her mobile home was blown over near Benham, said Joanna 
Miller, a Ripley County emergency dispatcher. In all, there were at 
least six people injured in the state, including a man in critical 
condition after being hit by lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight to 10 houses were damaged in and around Dillsboro, Ind.,  
but there were no injuries there, said Bill Black Jr., deputy 
director of Dearborn County Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	To the west, where the storm system spawned by a cold front went  
through Thursday afternoon and evening, some of the worst damage 
was reported in central Illinois. Two people were killed there. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of emergency vehicles converged on Ashland, Ill., a  
community of 1,200 people northwest of Springfield in the central 
part of the state, after winds ripped into a trailer park with 60 
to 70 homes. 
</P>
<P>
	One person was killed, a 68-year-old woman who was pulled from  
the debris that was once her home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just walked outside and just seen trailers tipping  
everywhere,'' said Lori Krenshaw, a resident of South Trailer Park 
in Ashland. ``It was a mess.'' Seven people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cisco, 65 miles east of Ashland, a 43-year-old woman was  
killed and her mother and two sons were injured when high winds 
destroyed a mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
	In Illinois, as in Ohio, forecasters said it was not immediately  
determined whether the damage was caused by tornadoes. Authorities 
must first inspect the pattern of damage, National Weather Service 
forecaster Brian Coniglio said in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, at least nine suspected tornadoes destroyed homes,  
downed barns and uprooted trees. No injuries were reported, but 
Ellen Gordon, Iowa's emergency management director, said the damage 
will probably top $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Deb Frisbie, who lives on a farm southeast of Adair, surveyed  
the damage to her home. Trees littered her yard, and a hay baler 
and other farm equipment were overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Frisbie said she saw ``just black coming at us.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We barely made it to the basement,'' she said. ``We didn't  
really hear anything. All I was worried about was getting everybody 
to the basement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado struck a five-block area in the eastern Nebraska town  
of North Bend on Thursday afternoon, damaging 14 homes and leveling 
one that was under construction. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Helga Garay's car was smashed by tree limbs outside her  
residence in Morse Bluff, south of North Bend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's a convertible,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The storm also damaged buildings and downed power lines in  
Missouri. One death was blamed on the storm there, the result of a 
crash on a rain-slick highway. 
</P>
<P>
	A barn owned by Harlen and Margaret Linville in Barnard, in  
northwest Missouri, was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was napping,'' Mrs. Linville said. ``When I roused, the barn  
was gone, debris was still flying.''

<HEADLINE> Teen Olympian, Family End Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- After enormous success at a young age -- followed  
by a high-profile rift with her parents -- Olympic gold medalist 
Dominique Moceanu may have finally found peace. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old gymnast and her parents have reached a  
confidential financial settlement and ended a protective order 
against her father, the Houston Chronicle and The Dallas Morning 
News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an extremely difficult time for my family, and I  
hope that we can now begin to move forward in support of one 
another,'' Miss Moceanu said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that deep down my father loves me, and of course I love  
him, so I need to find a way in my heart to give him forgiveness. I 
hope there is a chance that someday things in my family can be 
normal again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, signed Thursday by Family Law Judge Patricia  
Lykos, was kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
	The family fight erupted publicly last October, when Miss  
Moceanu sued for her independence, saying her father, Dumitru 
Moceanu, had squandered the money she had earned in a 10-year 
professional career. She was declared a legal adult Oct. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Moceanu's parents placed her earnings in a trust fund,  
which they administer. She did not have access to the trust until 
she turned 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father has said all of his daughter's earnings went into  
building a 70,000-square-foot gym with Miss Moceanu's blessings. He 
has refused to say how much the gym cost, but his attorney 
Katherine Scardino said it was about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The gymnast sought and won a court order on Dec. 9 that kept her  
father at least 500 feet away after police said they were 
investigating Dumitru, 44, for allegedly trying to hire killers to 
murder two of his daughter's friends. He denied the allegation.

<HEADLINE> Big Exam Going Computer Only </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Christopher Delaney just bought a laptop for  
his sailing school business, so he's fairly comfortable with 
computers. Yet, Delaney, 27, who's seeking a master's degree in 
oceanography, jumped at the chance to take the final paper version 
of the test required to get into most graduate schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paper and pencil is suited to my test-taking skills a little  
better,'' said Delaney of Boston. ``You can skip around if you come 
to a question you find particularly difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomorrow, he joins about 39,000 people nationwide taking the  
last paper Graduate Record Examination, the second major entrance 
test to become fully computerized. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, all 400,000 annual GRE test-takers must use the  
computer test, which unlike the paper version ``adapt'' to each 
person, asking tougher questions of those doing well, easier 
questions of those performing poorly and adjusting scores 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer version -- where test-takers click on answers on a  
computer screen with a mouse instead of penciling in ovals on a 
sheet of paper -- has been available since 1993. In 1997, the 
Graduate Management Admissions Test, required by most business 
schools, was the first to switch entirely to computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, almost half of GRE test-takers opted for the computer  
version, said Nancy Cole, president of Educational Testing Service, 
which administers the standardized tests owned by individual policy 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
	The change, however, has sparked debate over the quality and  
fairness of the computerized tests. And it's angered one test-taker 
enough that she's seeking legal action. 
</P>
<P>
	``These test scores will determine a person's life course; if  
there's still a problem, it's unforgivable for them to be switching 
the test,'' said Amy Cuddy, who has used a Massachusetts consumer 
law to alert ETS of a pending lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuddy, 26, who's required to send a letter 30 days before filing  
suit, charges that a computerized test she took in East Longmeadow, 
Mass., last fall was incorrectly scored. The score she got on the 
computer version differed wildly from the score on a paper version 
she took a month later, and from scores on practice computer tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the computer's ability to ``adapt,'' asking  
tougher or easier questions, gives a better picture of a 
test-taker's ability because concentration and time aren't wasted 
on questions that are too hard or easy. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say computer tests can be nerve-wracking for people  
used to paper tests that allow them to skip items, come back or 
change answers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Computerizing low-quality, multiple-choice tests does not  
magically transform them into better assessment instruments,'' said 
Robert A. Schaeffer of FairTest, a Cambridge, Mass., group that 
monitors testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, 400 GMAT test-takers saw a ``fatal error'' message  
flash on their computer screens immediately after they finished the 
three-hour exam. Some, who believed the glitch hurt their scores, 
demanded refunds. But ETS said the problem affected no scores and 
gave no refunds. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole says there's no proof the computerized version lowers or  
raises scores. And there's no way to cheat the system: ``You're not 
going to answer a couple wrong and just coast through. As soon as 
you answer them right, it starts getting harder again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Schatten, 28, who took the test in Columbia, Md., in  
December, found the test more convenient: ``I didn't think it was 
any less fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The computer tests cost more ($96, from about $55 for the paper  
GRE) and are offered six days a week instead of three times a year. 
Cole said because computers are more expensive, the testing service 
isn't making more money. 
</P>
<P>
	New York state is considering forcing the paper-and-pencil  
option, said Robert Shaw, an aide to state Sen. Kenneth P. LaValle, 
who heads the Legislature's higher education committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people who have been out of the academic environment  
for a while, who may not be as comfortable with a computer,'' Shaw 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York was first to require test-givers to provide a given  
exam's questions, answers and backup data to people disputing their 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole acknowledges the computer test's complex scoring makes it  
difficult to follow such ``truth in testing'' orders, but ETS is 
looking for ways to help people reviewing scores understand the 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
	The SAT, taken by about 2 million high-school students each  
year, is still given on paper, except for a computer version given 
to younger children for colleges tracking bright students for 
special programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Major exams for medical and law school, which are given by  
independent professional councils, are still given solely on paper.

<HEADLINE> O'Meara Still Has Masters Magic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Mark O'Meara let Tiger Woods and David Duval  
have the gallery in the first round of the Masters. All O'Meara did 
was produce the same kind of magic that won him the green jacket in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day Augusta National was allowing no liberties to be taken  
with its par 72, O'Meara birdied the 18th hole just like he did 
last year to win the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	His 70 positioned O'Meara comfortably a shot behind three others  
with a few rounds to be completed early today because of bad 
weather Thursday. He was tied with six others. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara said he had a special feeling again standing over a  
birdie putt on the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, O'Meara holed a 20-foot birdie putt on the last hole  
to win his first green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, it was an 8-footer as he concluded a round that took  
6 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't quite as nervous today as I was last year,'' O'Meara  
said. ``But I felt good over the putt like I did last year. It 
brought back memories knowing I could do it when I had to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good way to end what turned out to be a long, hard  
day. It was nice to get off to a good start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not many fans followed O'Meara even though he was the defending  
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara was ``third-fiddle'' behind Duval and Woods in the first  
round. 
</P>
<P>
	He had about 150 faithful followers. Most fans trooped after  
Duval, the No. 1 player in the world, and Woods, ranked No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara survived the day in his typical grinding style to prove  
once again it's foolish to overlook the man who won the Masters and 
British Open in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was a difficult day to stay focused.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleased with my composure, the way I hung in there,''  
O'Meara said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara's group didn't tee off until 1:12 p.m., and because  
officials decided to play threesomes the afternoon dragged along. 
</P>
<P>
	It took O'Meara's group of amateur Hank Kuehne and Lee Westwood  
one hour to play three holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Then O'Meara hooked a tee shot on the par-3, No. 4 after the  
long delay and made bogey. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Power Plants To Be Drilled for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Pencils and paper replaced computers at the  
nation's power plants Friday as operators tested some low-tech 
methods for sharing vital data that could be lost due to Year 2000 
bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Communications between generating stations is vital to the  
nation's power grid so that operators can send electricity to 
regions that need it the most from power plants able to provide it. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, workers at hundreds of sites called in meter readings  
via handheld radios and logged in data manually, rather than using 
computers hooked together via fiber-optic lines and microwave 
transmitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``People just flick a switch and expect their power to go on,  
but it's important to ensure that the grid is reliable and 
communications are a piece of that,'' said Tom Williams, spokesman 
for Duke Energy Power Services, which has three plants in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Results were to be posted at 6 p.m. EDT on the Web site of the  
North American Electric Reliability Council, a New Jersey-based 
industry group assigned by the U.S. Department of Energy to make 
sure the nation's utilities are ready for the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the council were unavailable for comment on  
the tests Friday despite two days of repeated telephone requests 
from the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Electricity customers weren't affected by Friday's drill because  
energy production wasn't tested. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Newark operations room of New Jersey's Public Service  
Electric and Gas Co., system operator Mike Cupo spoke into a red 
telephone receiver connected to the radio of an operator at a 
substation more than 30 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Branchburg,'' he said, ``Can I have the reading on the 5018,  
please?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The called-in results varied from the real thing because of the  
time it takes a substation operator to walk from the meter to a 
radio, said Robert Green, Y2K specialist for PSE&AMP;G, the state's 
largest utility company. 
</P>
<P>
	``This actually goes back to the way it used to be done before  
all the sophisticated computer monitoring equipping was around,'' 
said Mike Tyndall, spokesman for Atlanta-based Southern Company, 
the largest electricity producer in the country 
</P>
<P>
	The test date, April 9, was chosen because it is the 99th day of  
1999, a number experts fear might read as an error message in some 
computer programs, since some programmers once typed in a series of 
9s as placeholders. While electricity companies don't believe the 
date will cause any glitches, they wanted to be prepared. Another 
drill is scheduled for Sept. 9, 1999, the ninth month of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug stems from older computer programs' and chips' use  
of only two digits for the year. When 2000 rolls around, some 
programs might think it is 1900, resulting in anything from 
calculation mistakes to outright failures. 
</P>
<P>
	NERC's job is to help make sure electrical utilities are ready  
for the possibility of a Y2K glitch and spotty outages or -- a 
worse-case scenario -- complete electricity shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Consumers) should gain a measure of confidence that the  
loonies out there who are profiting by panic over Y2K may not have 
it quite right,'' said John Castagna, a spokesman for the 
Washington-based Edison Electric Institute, an industry group whose 
members generate about three-quarters of the country's electricity. 
``We're working hard to make Jan. 1, 2000 is just like every other 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Guidry, managing editor of Y2K News Magazine, expected  
NERC's results to be positive. ``They've been planning this drill 
since the beginning of the year. I would compare it to a student in 
high school taking a test after he's had three months to make up 
the questions on the test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Friday's test didn't cover the actual generation of power,  
Southern Co.'s Tyndall said his utility has already been working on 
that for three years, using computer simulations to pretend it's 
Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel very comfortable about our ability to generate and  
distribute power to our customers through the transition to the 
year 2000, not just because of this one test,'' Tyndall said. 
``We've actually rolled the clocks forward at some of our plants 
and there were no problems. There's nothing that we can see that 
would cause any kind of major power disruptions.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Principal Charged in Cocaine Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A grade-school principal faces charges of  
leading a small narcotics ring on campus with the school nurse and 
a janitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities shut down the private, 160-student Tabernacle Church  
of God Elementary School in Brooklyn after discovering the ring. 
They said the defendants dealt drugs to adults behind the scenes 
while children were busy in class. 
</P>
<P>
	But Principal Delores Hill allegedly made one sale while  
baby-sitting two infants in her office, said Deputy District 
Attorney Patricia Gatling. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hill, 53, and the others were arrested Thursday after she  
allegedly sold $25 bags of cocaine to an undercover policewoman on 
school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, who has no criminal record, was charged with felony sale  
and possession of a controlled substance. She was held on $250,000 
bail. The maximum sentence for the charges is 25 years in prison. 
Hill's attorney, Frank Paone, would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The school in the low-income neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant  
was closed down after the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	The janitor, Steven Donawa, 42, was arrested after he stopped by  
Hill's apartment and left carrying 51 bags of cocaine, prosecutors 
said. Patricia Kersey, 41, the school nurse, was arrested for 
allegedly selling cocaine to an undercover police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were charged with sale and possession of cocaine.

<HEADLINE> Meares' Pittsburgh Debut Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pat Meares' career with the Pittsburgh Pirates  
still hasn't gotten to first base -- or, more importantly, to 
shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares, perhaps the most significant of the Pirates' six  
offseason additions, was placed on the 15-day disabled list Friday 
with a sprained left wrist that still has not allowed him to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is retroactive to April 2, the day Meares was injured  
while batting in an exhibition game against Philadelphia. He cannot 
be activated until April 17, when the Pirates play in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares, who hit .356 during spring training, initially hoped to  
play by Friday. Despite receiving a cortisone injection in the 
wrist Sunday, Meares cannot grip a bat enough to take batting 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still not ready,'' manager Gene Lamont said. ``We thought  
he would be ready by now, but the wrist hasn't come along like we 
thought it would. He had trouble playing catch Wednesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until Meares is ready, Mike Benjamin will continue to play short  
and Warren Morris will play second, although rookie Abraham Nunez 
may make at least one start at short. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates were reluctant to put Meares on the disabled list,  
but had to make room on the 25-man roster so right-hander Kris 
Benson could start against the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	They planned initially to activate Meares and return Nunez to  
Triple-A Nashville, but doing so would have left them with only two 
healthy middle infielders, Benjamin and Morris. They also didn't 
want to go with just 10 pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to make sure Pat's ready,'' Lamont said. ``We  
miss him but Mike Benjamin knows what he's doing out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meares' impact on the Pirates was clearly evident this spring as  
he upgraded what was by far the Pirates' weakest position last 
season. Kevin Polcovich (.189) and Lou Collier (.246) combined for 
a .223 average and 38 errors, and Nunez added seven more errors 
following his late-season recall. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares hit .260 with 70 RBIs for Minnesota last season. Between  
them, Polcovich and Collier had only 48 RBIs in 546 at-bats.

	Bombing Takes Toll in Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A barrage of NATO airstrikes across  
Yugoslavia on Orthodox Good Friday sent a fireball soaring from a 
fuel depot and choked nearby vineyards under black smoke. A Cyprus 
envoy blamed the bombing for a Yugoslav decision not to free three 
captured U.S. servicemen. Western officials said the airstrikes, 
now in their third week, are beginning to take a toll on President 
Slobodan Milosevic's forces, cutting them off from supplies and 
decimating the country's infrastructure. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Decries Milosevic  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accused Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic of presenting an ``illusion of partial 
compliance'' with NATO demands today, as the Pentagon ordered six 
more F-15C jet fighters to Europe in the first of expected major 
reinforcements in the allied air armada. Clinton said NATO 
airstrikes would not stop despite Milosevic's unilateral 
cease-fire.

	DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Del. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said  
today it's the nation's duty to help refugees displaced by Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic's ethnic cleansing campaign. She told 
airmen at Dover Air Force Base their work transporting meals for 
tens of thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees flooding into Albania 
and Macedonia has not gone unnoticed.

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra Misses Second Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Boston's Nomar Garciaparra remained  
sidelined with a strained left hamstring Friday night and could 
miss the rest of the weekend series against the Tampa Bay Devil 
Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	The shortstop, whose status is day to day, left in the ninth  
inning of Boston's victory over Kansas City on Wednesday night. He 
sat out the finale of a three-game series against the Royals on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt a little better. Maybe I'll see if I can jog a little  
tomorrow,'' Garciaparra said after the Red Sox won 4-1 to remain 
unbeaten in four games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I swung today in the cage, just to make sure I can do that,  
and that's fine,'' he said. ``I know I can swing, but that's not 
going to do me a lot of good if I can't run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston may be reluctant to use Garciaparra the rest of the  
weekend because the Devil Rays play on artificial turf at Tropicana 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'll be on the field this series,'' the  
shortstop said. ``Right now, I'm just looking for improvement every 
day.''

<HEADLINE>  Yanks' Zimmer Becomes the Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fifty-one years in baseball has made Don Zimmer  
one of the game's great storytellers. One month as New York Yankees 
interim manager has made him the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you guys said nine words to me in three years  
being a bench coach and I loved every minute of it,'' Zimmer said 
Friday before the Yankees beat the Detroit Tigers 12-3 in their 
home opener. ``This is something I just hope I don't screw up. I 
can't wait for Joe to get back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until Joe Torre returns from prostate cancer surgery, Zimmer's  
first priority will be keeping the best team in baseball on track, 
not being the Yankees' Yoda, imparting wisdom and tales. 
</P>
<P>
	And he has an ample supply of both. That's to be expected from a  
man who played briefly for the team that lost the most games in 
baseball history -- the 1962 New York Mets -- and was bench coach for 
last year's Yankees team that won the most games ever. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Torre is gone, don't expect Zimmer to try to imitate  
his friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did that the first two weeks and that was the end of that,''  
said Zimmer, whose record is now 3-1. ``I have to be myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Cone, who started Friday's home opener, has seen the  
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he is more comfortable,'' Cone said. ``The only way  
you can do that is to win some games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If not for Torre, who asked Zimmer to join him in New York  
before the 1996 season, Zimmer would be back in Florida with his 
wife Jean, spending his time at the movies and the race track. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead he is running the World Series champions, talking  
baseball and enjoying every minute of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who doesn't get a special feeling on opening day,  
especially if you are in a uniform, something is wrong,'' said 
Zimmer, who last managed at Yankee Stadium on July 23, 1982, less 
than one week before he was fired by Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, in fact, was supposed to manage the opener at Yankee  
Stadium that year too, but a snow storm wiped out the entire 
series. He was here for the opener the year before, when his 
Rangers lost to the Yankees 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's different being in pinstripes on this kind of day.  
</P>
<P>
	``Coming off the year we had, to walk out today in front of  
50,000 some odd people who are expecting big things is special,'' 
Zimmer said. ``Hopefully the players will play well enough to get 
back to the World Series. I always said the goal should be to win 
the division, but we know that winning the Eastern Division 
championship is not good enough here. Other places you'd be tickled 
to death with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer doesn't shy away from New York's pressure and even  
challenged owner George Steinbrenner to fire him last week over the 
use of Hideki Irabu, whom The Boss called a ``fat ... toad,'' 
setting off Zimmer's first controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said he would quit before adhering to Steinbrenner's  
wishes and starting Irabu on Wednesday in place of Ramiro Mendoza. 
He held firm, even used Irabu for an inning of relief, and hasn't 
heard a complaint yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think George and I are very tight and we'll be all right. I  
did what The Boss said and pitched Irabu on Wednesday,'' Zimmer 
joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing up to Steinbrenner is easy for Zimmer, who already  
walked away from the game once in 1995. While serving as Don 
Baylor's bench coach in Colorado that year, Zimmer packed up his 
bags and left in the fifth inning of a game, not to return to 
baseball until Torre called him the next winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't like the way things were going so I went to Bob  
Gebhard, the team president, and told him about a week before that 
I was retiring on June 6 in the fifth inning,'' Zimmer said. ``Next 
I told Baylor and I think he thought I was really gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``So that day, I went to the clubhouse in the fifth inning,  
showered, took my fungo and my bag and watched the final two 
innings on television in my living room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer waited until Friday's game finished before leaving, then  
rushed out of the interview room with a big smile. The only way to 
end such a memorable day was with a memorable meal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have dinner with the boss,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A fraction of a second later, Zimmer realized he might have sent  
the wrong message. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' he said, ``not that Boss.''  
</P>
<P>
	It was his victory, but he had to share it with Torre, too.

Baylor's bench coach in Colorado that year, Zimmer packed up his 
bags and left in the fifth inning of a game, not to return to 
baseball until Torre called him the next winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't like the way things were going so I went to Bob  
Gebhard, the team president, and told him about a week before that 
I was retiring on June 6 in the fifth inning,'' Zimmer said. ``Next 
I told Baylor and I think he thought I was really gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``So that day, I went to the clubhouse in the fifth inning,  
showered, took my fungo and my bag and watched the final two 
innings on television in my living room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer waited until Friday's game finished before leaving, then  
rushed out of the interview room with a big smile. The only way to 
end such a memorable day was with a memorable meal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have dinner with the boss,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A fraction of a second later, Zimmer realized he might have sent  
the wrong message. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' he said, ``not that Boss.''  
</P>
<P>
	It was his victory, but he had to share it with Torre, too.

<HEADLINE> Pettitte To Make Start in Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A day after throwing four innings in a minor  
league simulated game, New York Yankees left-hander Andy Pettitte 
said Friday he hopes to rejoin the rotation on April 17 at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte is scheduled to start Monday for the Yankees' Double-A  
team at Norwich, Conn., against New Britain in an Eastern League 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``My arms feels great,'' said Pettitte, who pitched Thursday in  
Tampa, Fla., then traveled to New York for the Yankees' home 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees originally thought Pettitte would be sidelined 3-5  
days after slightly spraining his right ankle Tuesday. Pettitte, 
placed on the disabled list during spring training because of a 
stiff left elbow, felt well enough to pitch Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to throw to some live hitters,'' he said. ``I'm  
still so far behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees don't need a fifth starter until April 17, starting  
the season with a four-man rotation that includes Roger Clemens, 
Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, Ramiro Mendoza and David Cone.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Sign Martin, Await Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- If Tony Martin plays this season, it will be for  
the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Pro Bowl receiver signed a four-year contract Friday  
with Miami, but federal charges of laundering drug money cloud his 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract was for $14.2 million, including a $3.3 million  
signing bonus. Martin will receive only $100,000 if he's 
unavailable to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the deal was reached, a judge scheduled Martin's  
trial to begin Aug. 2, four days after training camp opens and six 
weeks before the season starts. The trial is expected to last three 
to four weeks, meaning Martin could miss most of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jimmy Johnson was out of his office Friday and unavailable  
for comment. Martin is expected to hold a news conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	If Martin is acquitted, he'll provide the Dolphins the deep  
receiving threat that Dan Marino has lacked in recent years. Martin 
would likely start along with O.J. McDuffie, who led the NFL last 
year with 90 receptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin turns 34 in September but has showed no signs of slowing  
down. Last season he caught 66 passes for 1,181 yards for the NFC 
champion Atlanta Falcons. They released him in February following 
his indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with the Dolphins follows six weeks of negotiations.  
The contract calls for a base salary of $400,000 in 1999, $2.1 
million in 2000, $3.7 million in 2001 and $4.7 million in 2002, 
when Martin will be 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin played with the Dolphins from 1990 to 1993 but made  
little impact, averaging 27 catches and two touchdowns per season. 
He was traded to San Diego for a fourth-round draft pick and 
blossomed in 1995, catching 90 passes for 1,224 yards, and was 
voted to the Pro Bowl in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was traded to Atlanta before the 1998 season and sparked  
the Falcons' surprising run to the Super Bowl. He caught five 
passes for 129 yards in the NFC championship game against 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins have repeatedly been frustrated in their attempts  
to acquire a deep receiving threat. Yatil Green, a first-round 
draft choice in 1997, has yet to play because of knee injuries, and 
last year Miami missed a chance to draft Randy Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore, who earlier declined  
Martin's request for a trial next January, scheduled it Friday to 
begin in August. That's a three-month delay from the earlier trial 
date of May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin will be tried with Rickey Brownlee, who served seven  
years in prison for 1980s drug convictions. They became friends in 
high school, and prosecutors allege that Martin wrote checks to 
lease luxury cars and pay legal fees for Brownlee. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin has said he's innocent. He's not charged with any  
involvement in drug activity.

<HEADLINE> U.S., China Can't Reach Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators came close,  
but in the end they weren't able to overcome all the obstacles to 
achieving a comprehensive agreement that would throw open China's 
vast market to American exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji were able to  
strike smaller deals benefiting U.S. citrus farmers, wheat growers 
in the Pacific Northwest and beef, pork and poultry producers. 
</P>
<P>
	But four days of marathon talks did not produce the overall deal  
that Zhu had hoped would be the centerpiece of his American visit, 
a market-opening package that would win U.S. support for China's 
entry into the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Both U.S. and Chinese officials tried to put the best face on  
the failure, pledging to keep working to close the remaining gaps 
so that China will be able to gain WTO membership by November when 
the Geneva-based trade organization is scheduled to launch a new 
round of global trade negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made significant progress toward bringing China into the  
World Trade Organization on fair commercial terms, but we are not 
there yet,'' Clinton told reporters at a joint news conference with 
Zhu on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the agriculture agreements, the United States won  
agreements from China to double the number of airline flights 
between the two countries as well as promises from China to crack 
down on piracy of computer programs and to expand sales 
opportunities for American insurance firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more tantalizing for American companies, both countries  
released a lengthy list of market-opening commitments Chinese 
negotiators made in hopes of winning the comprehensive WTO deal. 
Those commitments won't become binding until the United States 
drops its objections and allows China to enter the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	But by publishing the commitments China is willing to make, the  
administration is hoping to win the backing of U.S. businesses for 
what will be a tough battle in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	China must win annual approval for its goods to be imported into  
the United States under normal tariffs applied to other countries. 
But if China gained WTO membership, Congress would have to pass 
legislation to eliminate this annual tariff approval process. 
</P>
<P>
	The record $57 billion U.S. trade deficit with China and new  
allegations about Chinese thefts of U.S. nuclear secrets have given 
added ammunition to opponents of Clinton's policy of engagement 
with China. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said the political  
hurdles in the United States made it all the more important that 
U.S. negotiators win the very best WTO deal possible. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the major sticking points that prevented agreement this  
week was China's refusal to accept a demand that the United States 
have the right to impose unilateral trade sanctions on China for a 
period of years after it enters the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration was unwilling to relent on this point,  
fearing opponents would charge that the United States had given up 
its right to enforce China's trade commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	Other areas where China's market-opening offers were deemed  
insufficient were banking, especially the ability of U.S. firms to 
offer auto loans to Chinese consumers, sales of stocks and other 
securities and distribution rights for American-made movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the United States was demanding extra protection for U.S.  
textile and apparel manufacturers by requiring China to submit to 
quotas for five years longer than any other WTO members. 
</P>
<P>
	China has been trying for 13 years to win entry in the WTO and  
the organization that preceded it, the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Various industry groups that have been hoping for agreement as a  
way to increase sales in China's vast market urged the 
administration to push ahead to a final agreement in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Great strides have been made in the right direction. What's  
important now is that we maintain our negotiating momentum,'' said 
Dianne Sullivan, director of trade policy for the National 
Association of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	But AFL-CIO President John Sweeney warned, ``China's history of  
not living up to agreements is strong cause for skepticism. 
Effective compliance mechanisms are essential to any agreement that 
may be reached.''

<HEADLINE> DeBartolo Sued by 49ers, Own Corp. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Eddie DeBartolo's problems in the bayou now  
encompass the boardroom of the San Francisco 49ers and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces a lawsuit filed by the 49ers and his sister -- who's in  
charge because of NFL sanctions against him. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit filed Thursday in San Francisco Superior Court accuses  
the suspended 49ers co-owner of owing the company $94 million and 
stalling a new stadium project. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo's spokesman called the lawsuit a ``sad and desperate  
act'' by Denise DeBartolo York and her husband, John York. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sam Singer, a spokesman for the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.,  
said the lawsuit was not about any personal dispute between 
DeBartolo and his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denise loves her brother very much, but they have vastly  
different business styles,'' Singer said. ``What this really is 
about is this is a corporate lawsuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The corporation and the 49ers have been run by the Yorks since  
DeBartolo became enmeshed 16 months ago in a Louisiana gambling 
fraud scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said it is seeking repayment of the alleged debt,  
cutting DeBartolo's management ties to the team and ending a $10 
million financial interest claimed by DeBartolo in the $525 million 
stadium project. It has been stalled because of soaring 
construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plaintiffs bring this action only after exhausting all  
efforts, spanning two years, to resolve these disputes,'' the suit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL spokeswoman Leslie Hammond said the league did not have any  
immediate comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue sanctioned DeBartolo  
and fined him $1 million, saying he was guilty of conduct 
detrimental to the league for his involvement in the gambling fraud 
case. He also extended DeBartolo's NFL banishment until at least 
February 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue forbade DeBartolo from exercising any authority over  
the 49ers' operations, and DeBartolo agreed not ``to retard or in 
any way impede'' the efforts to get a new stadium, according to the 
suit, which charges that DeBartolo violated that agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue has said DeBartolo would face an additional $4 million  
fine if he violated its terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``As events and the various lawsuits to come will demonstrate,  
Mr. DeBartolo is entitled to control of the 49ers following the 
lifting of his suspension, over $100 million of damages from the 
Yorks, and an immediate equal say in the running of the family 
businesses,'' said spokesman Rick Rice. ``To avoid meeting their 
obligations, the Yorks have breached prior agreements, refused to 
attend shareholder meetings, and rebuffed all overtures at 
restoring family peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said they filed the lawsuit because ``Mrs. York will lose  
control of the board of the Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation at next 
Tuesday's annual meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singer said he had ``no idea'' what the $100 million referred  
to. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the $94 million debt incurred over a decade stemmed from  
DeBartolo's ``lavish personal lifestyle,'' a series of failed 
business attempts, and money owed to investors in other 
partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
	League sources have said that under the sanctions, DeBartolo is  
forbidden from visiting the press box or the team's locker room. 
While he is free to attend games, he isn't allowed to sit in the 
owner's box. 
</P>
<P>
	Another clause includes a total prohibition on gambling, either  
by him personally or as part of his business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo, who pleaded guilty in October to failing to report a  
felony in connection with the gambling fraud case, could be 
reinstated by the league if he satisfies the terms of his 
banishment, Tagliabue has said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo retains the right to discuss some aspects of team  
operations with his sister and John York, now a vice president of 
the 49ers. But any such discussions are to be strictly advisory, 
and the Yorks are free to accept or ignore his advice.

<HEADLINE> Internet Hoax Sends Stock Soaring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As if there wasn't enough uncertainty in  
investing, along came the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A bogus report on PairGain Technologies posted this week on the  
World Wide Web boosted the company's stock price 31 percent before 
the story was debunked. It was a disturbing reminder of the power 
and peril of relying on online information to make decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street whispers are nothing new, but the growth of the  
Internet has allowed people to instantaneously spread word on a 
potentially hot stock. While that has helped foster an online 
investment boom, there's a downside. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Web means that scoundrels are able to disseminate  
fraudulent information far more widely and much more quickly,'' 
said John Delaney, co-chairman of the new media practice at 
Morrison &AMP; Foerster, a New York law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	No one yet knows the source or the motives behind the fake  
report on PairGain, which appeared early Wednesday on 
Angelfire.com, a site that allows surfers to create personal Web 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said PairGain, a Tustin, Calif., maker of  
telecommunications equipment, would be acquired by an Israeli firm, 
ECI Telecom, for $1.35 billion, or about twice its current market 
value. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders jumped on the hot tip, buying up shares and touting the  
stock in chat rooms run by Yahoo! The report appeared credible, 
with quotes from company officials, and the page was a near-perfect 
replica of the Web site run by financial news giant Bloomberg LP. 
</P>
<P>
	PairGain shares, which closed at $8.50 Tuesday, rose to more  
than $11 on Wednesday before company officials confirmed the report 
was untrue and the fake page was yanked from the Internet. The 
stock settled back to close at about $9 on volume of 13.7 million 
shares. On an average trading day, about 2 million shares of 
PairGain change hands. 
</P>
<P>
	PairGain and Bloomberg officials said Thursday that they had  
turned the matter over to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts said the perpetrator of the PairGain hoax could  
find himself charged with securities and wire fraud, and could face 
five to 30 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The losses to investors who took the bait are tough to tally.  
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of stock traders lamented the hoax in postings on  
investment chat rooms while a few chastised themselves for 
responding so quickly to the PairGain rumor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's raise our requirements for allowing ourselves to be  
impressed,'' wrote one trader. ``Criminality deserves no 
admiration,'' wrote another. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet rumors spread over the Internet have been the lifeblood of  
the growing ranks of day traders, who try to make quick profits 
from the twists and turns of corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
	And in chat rooms or message boards, thousands of anonymous  
traders encourage each other to buy, sell or hold. Chief executive 
officers, waitresses and teen-agers alike can log on and offer 
investment advice without ever disclosing their true identities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet has become the world's largest conference call,''  
said Anthony Elgindy, an online trader who runs Pacific Equity 
Investigations, a research firm. ``And plenty of the people talking 
about stocks have hidden motives for what they're saying.''

<HEADLINE> Braves Salute Hank Aaron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Hank Aaron remembers the hate mail, but time has  
erased much of the bitterness and now it's time to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves continued the healing process Thursday night  
with a season-long salute honoring Aaron on the 25th anniversary of 
his historic 715th home run that broke Babe Ruth's record. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig, NL president Len Coleman and Al Downing,  
the victim of Aaron's monumental homer, were among those on hand to 
honor Aaron during a 45-minute ceremony prior to the Braves' game 
against the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know 25 years ago ... when I hit that home run to beat the  
Babe's record, it was truly one of the most remarkable evenings 
that I have ever had in baseball,'' Aaron said after the sellout 
crowd of 47,225 at Turner Field gave him a two-minute standing 
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``But tonight tops it all,'' said Aaron, now 65 and a Braves  
senior vice president. ``This is truly a wonderful day for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tribute has helped Aaron, who finished his 23-year career  
with 755 home runs, forget his somewhat bittersweet memories of the 
chase to beat Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
	As he neared Ruth, Aaron received hundreds of thousands of  
parcels of mail, many filled with hatred because there were people 
who did not want a black man from Mobile, Ala., breaking Ruth's 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the hurt was then-commissioner Bowie Kuhn, who wasn't  
at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium on the night when Aaron broke the 
record. Kuhn was at a dinner in Cleveland, and sent one of his 
assistants, Monte Irvin, in his place. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you would have asked me 15 years ago, you would have found  
a much angrier person, but time has a way of healing things,'' he 
said during news conference, seated between his wife, Billye, and 
Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen him a few times since then,'' he said of Kuhn, ``but  
have not talked to him about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig, Braves chairman of the board Bill Bartholomay and Tom  
Johnson, chairman and CEO of Cable News Network, spoke glowingly of 
Aaron. Hall of Famers Lou Brock, Frank Robinson and Phil Niekro 
also took part in the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron was honored with video tributes and two songs performed by  
Kenny Rogers -- ``The Greatest'' and ``Heroes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The finale was the unveiling of the Hank Aaron Award, which was  
announced in February. The award will go to the best hitter in each 
league each year, said Selig, who called it the equivalent of the 
Cy Young Award and the Most Valuable Player. 
</P>
<P>
	``You brought us joy and you brought us honor and it is a  
privilege to honor you tonight,'' Selig told Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig, in a news conference earlier, presented the award -- a  
wooden plaque with an engraved silver bat atop home plate -- to 
Aaron, as the first winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why so long? That's a tough question to answer,'' Selig said.  
``But I think this is the appropriate time. It's something that 
should have happened long ago. Like a lot of things in life, I wish 
it had been a happier experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The celebration was the first that will take place during the  
regular season at major league parks to celebrate Aaron's feat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just enjoying the moment,'' Aaron's wife said. ``It's just  
been uphill and a wonderful, wonderful experience of making up for 
all that didn't happen 25 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron began his major league career in 1953 and spent his entire  
career in Milwaukee or Atlanta, breaking Ruth's record of 714 
career home runs on April 8, 1974 in the fourth inning off Downing 
of the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball sailed over the left-center field fence at  
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, just across the street from the 
current stadium, as the crowd of 53,775 roared. It was caught in 
the bullpen by Braves reliever Tom House at 9:07 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a cold night, but it was a very good night,'' Aaron  
recalled. ``I guess you could say I was nervous, like I am 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron played two more years in Milwaukee before retiring.  
</P>
<P>
	He has more RBIs (2,297), extra-base hits (1,477) and total  
bases (6,856) than anyone. He ranks second in at-bats (12,364) and 
runs (2,174), third in games (3,298) and hits (3,771), and ninth in 
doubles (624). During a 23-year career, he batted .305. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, President Clinton led a celebration in Atlanta of  
Aaron's 65th birthday, and baseball named the hitting award for 
Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the charity event raised $1 million for The Chasing  
The Dream Foundation, started five years ago by the Aarons for 
underprivileged youngsters. The check was presented to Aaron by 
CNN's Johnson during the ceremony.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Los Angeles Kings defenseman Rob Blake was  
suspended for two games and fined $128,475.60 Friday by the NHL for 
cross-checking to the head of San Jose's Alexander Korolyuk. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred in Thursday's game at Los Angeles and  
resulted in a minor penalty for Blake. The suspension will sideline 
him for games Sunday at Dallas and Monday at Nashville. He will be 
eligible to return Thursday against Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Blake, who was suspended for three games for slashing in  
December, was fined under the league's repeat offender category, 
which assesses 1-82nd of a player's salary for each day suspended.

<HEADLINE> Courier Set To Lead Americans Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- It's the match Jim Courier wanted. And  
the one he made sure the United States played in. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Davis Cup quarterfinal rich in tennis tradition, Courier  
will lead a United States team against Australia in the event's 
centennial at the site where the matches first were held in 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of like the `Twilight Zone,''' Courier said Thursday  
about the event scheduled for July 16 through 18 at Longwood 
Cricket Club. ``That's the matchup we wanted, and I think the 
matchup that everyone wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Courier's singles victory in Birmingham, England, on Sunday  
allowed the Americans to advance with a 3-2 first-round win over 
Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The next round will highlight the most storied rivalry in the  
tournament's history, with Australia's 26 Davis Cup titles second 
only to the United States' 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier, who outlasted Britain's Greg Rusedski in the fifth  
match to help the United States defeat Great Britain, said he was 
afraid that Bostonians wouldn't be as vocal as the British were in 
supporting their team. 
</P>
<P>
	A sellout crowd of 9,300 attended Courier's clinching win.  
</P>
<P>
	But if the round of cheers and a standing ovation by some 100  
guests at Longwood on Thursday was any indication, Courier won't 
have to worry. 
</P>
<P>
	His win was made even more memorable for the United States  
because Courier and his teammates had to do it without the help of 
Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, who decided not to play. 
</P>
<P>
	While he was not upset by their decisions, Courier said he could  
not relate to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can win all the Hong Kong and Atlanta tournaments you want  
to, but you're not going to remember those when you're 80 years 
old,'' Courier said. ``You're going to tell your grandkids about 
the Davis Cup matches you played on foreign soil when you had 9,300 
people screaming at you and it was the six-all of the fifth set of 
the last match. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, it doesn't get any more memorable than that.''  
</P>
<P>
	That happened when Courier beat Rusedski 6-4, 6-7 (7-3), 6-3,  
1-6, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterfinal round should be held in Australia because the  
last time the two teams met in the Davis Cup in 1997 the matches 
were in Washington, D.C. Davis Cup rules call for the sites to be 
alternated between the participating nations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boston was chosen because this year's Davis Cup is the  
100th. The United States beat Britain at Longwood in 1900, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennis Australia plans to appeal to the International Tennis  
Federation in a bid to get the quarterfinal switched to Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier said he understands that some Australians are upset by  
the switch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do feel for them,'' he said. ``But in the big scheme of  
things, I think tennis is the real winner.''

<HEADLINE> EU Panel OKs Lucent Buyout of Ascend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union Commission on Friday  
approved Lucent Technologies' $18.7 billion buyout of fellow U.S. 
high-tech communications company Ascend Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``The operation is essentially of a complementary nature and  
gives rise to few overlaps,'' the Commission said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission does not have the power to block the merger, but  
could prevent the new business from operating in the European Union 
if it determined the combined company's business would violate EU 
fair trade regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent is the world's No. 1 phone equipment maker. Ascend is a  
major supplier of computer networking gear, and is expected to 
provide Lucent with expertise in Internet-style communications 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent and Ascend announced their merger agreement in January.  
The joint entity will be called Lucent-Ascend.

<HEADLINE> Computer Virus Sleuths Hunt Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

 *AP Photo ASB101    	
</P>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The rules of war say know your enemy --  
valuable advice, unless your enemies are the misfits who create 
computer viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the team that battled Melissa -- among scores of other  
computer viruses over the years -- say they have little interest in 
the people who tweak or cripple computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't get down to the `who.' We're technology-based. We  
want to know how these things happened and how they can be fixed,'' 
said Tom Longstaff, who supervises the Computer Emergency Response 
Team. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-member team, which works at the Software Engineering  
Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, was formed in 1988 in 
response to the Morris Worm -- a virus that disabled part of the 
predecessor to the Internet. Since then, the team has addressed 
14,000 security breaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are the ones I trust,'' said Peter Shankman, an Internet  
site designer in New York and former America Online news site 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it would be much tougher to get accurate information on  
the gossipy Internet without the ``calming voice'' of CERT. The 
software institute, which started in 1984, gets $26 million a year 
from the Defense Department and another $12 million from private 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	In exposing Melissa, CERT caught a break by learning about it on  
the afternoon of March 26 -- a Friday. That gave analysts extra time 
with the program before a weekday and potential chaos from the 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We analyze it as a piece of software. We're not out there  
chasing down the bad guys,'' said CERT member Shawn Hernan, who 
spent that Friday night with Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	CERT put the word out Saturday morning through an advisory on  
its Internet site, www.cert.org. At the time, CERT said it was only 
the second time it has considered a virus important enough to 
warrant a public announcement. The first, in 1994, warned of a 
virus that allowed computer burglars to collect passwords. 
</P>
<P>
	By Monday, Melissa's reputation was well-known, allowing  
computer managers to create protections before workers showed up 
and checked e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the virus is known to have affected 300 organizations  
and 100,000 people and probably hit more, according to CERT. Its 
effectiveness was aided by the element of trust -- the virus was 
disguised as an ``important message'' from a friend or colleague. 
It caused computers to fire off 50 infected messages, slowing or 
disabling e-mail systems. 
</P>
<P>
	One advertising agency reported e-mails going out at a rate of  
711 per minute before its computers crashed, CERT's Jeff Carpenter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa's alleged creator, New Jersey computer consultant David  
L. Smith, appeared in court Thursday to be advised of state charges 
against him. Federal investigators are also studying the case. 
</P>
<P>
	CERT, meanwhile, readied itself for variations expected to  
appear during the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without Melissa offshoots, the team likely will remain busy  
since, according to Longstaff, about one-quarter of Internet users 
have less than one year's computer experience. And that makes for a 
lot of unwary victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the beginning, everyone on the Internet was an expert and  
could pretty much get a handle on a problem,'' Longstaff said. 
``But now we are dealing with helpless victims, and the experts are 
few and far between.''

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy Shrinks 11 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand's state planning agency said  
Friday that gross domestic product shrank 11 percent year-on-year 
in the third quarter of 1998, but grew 1.4 percent over the 
previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Economic and Social Development Board said in a  
report that GDP during the first three quarters of 1998 contracted 
9.6 percent from the same period of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thai economy spun into a deep recession after the currency  
was floated in July 1997, triggering the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency revised its estimate of the year-on-year contraction  
in GDP during the second quarter to 12 percent, from 11.1 percent. 
The first quarter contraction was 5.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand's government has estimated that GDP shrank 8 percent  
over the full year in 1998. It predicts recovery in year-on-year 
GDP growth by the second half of 1999 and 1 percent growth for the 
full year. 
</P>
<P>
	The forecast assumes positive results from a 130 billion baht  
($3.6 billion) fiscal stimulus package announced last week that 
comprises tax cuts and new spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has said it will implement further stimulus  
measures if export performance remains poor. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1 percent GDP growth forecast assumes export growth of 4  
percent, but performance so far this year has run under target due 
to generally lower prices and stiff competition in global markets.

<HEADLINE> F-16s Grounded With Engine Cracks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- An investigation into a rash of crashes at the  
nation's largest F-16 base has led to the discovery of engine 
cracks in 17 of the fighter jets, the Air Force said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Cracks up to an inch long were found in the jets' Pratt &AMP;  
Whitney 220 engines, Luke Air Force Base spokeswoman Mary Jo May 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 75 percent of the jets have been inspected so far at Luke,  
which has 190 of the nation's roughly 400 F-16's. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we find cracks, those engines will not be flown anymore.  
Those planes will be down until new parts come in,'' May said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cracks were found in augmentor ducts that help provide  
thrust for the engine by forcing air out of the engines' nozzles. 
Brig. Gen. John Barry, the base commander, said the cracks have the 
potential to cause a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	All 400 of the nation's F-16s using the Pratt &AMP; Whitney 220  
engine were grounded for a few days in March following what was the 
fifth F-16 crash at Luke in six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry said earlier inspections failed to find the cracks because  
the equipment used could not detect them. The Pentagon provided an 
enhanced dye and blacklight that outlined the cracks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The affected engines were designed in the 1970s. Since then,  
Pratt &AMP; Whitney has come out with an updated version of the engine 
-- the F100-PW-229. A company spokesman said the new engine has 
higher reliability. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Air Force has never lost an F-16 equipped with a 229  
engine,'' Pratt spokesman Tim Burris said. 
</P>
<P>
	The F-16s patrolling no-fly zones over Iraq and flying in the  
Kosovo airstrikes do not use the Pratt 220 engine.

<HEADLINE>  Serbs Reopen Albanian Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZDA, Macedonia (AP) -- After an all-out push by aid agencies,  
foreign nations and NATO, relief workers were near the point of 
ensuring food, shelter and safety for all the nearly half-million 
people who fled Kosovo, the U.N. refugee chief said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia later reopened a border with Albania it had closed  
earlier in the week and hundreds of people crossed from Kosovo 
within the first hours, said a spokesman for the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the progress made, the international community was still  
concerned enough about the plight of Kosovo Albanian refugees in 
camps in often-hostile Macedonia that it asked NATO troops to stick 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	``The humanitarian effort ... continues to gain momentum and I  
think it will be a matter of days before we have the situation 
quite under control,'' said Sadako Ogata, U.N. High Commissioner 
for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogata toured the week-old Brazda refugee camp in Macedonia on  
Friday -- at 2,000 tents and 25,000 refugees, the largest of the 
NATO camps sheltering Kosovo Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting Italy, Albania and Macedonia, the U.N. refugee chief is  
trying to coordinate care for the Kosovo refugees -- and for any new 
influx, either from Serb offensives or a renewed campaign of forced 
expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonian leaders committed themselves Friday to keeping their  
borders open to refugees in the event of a new crisis, Ogata said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia appeared to have at least partially reopened borders  
by Friday, after closing them three days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	OSCE spokesman Andrea Agneli said the Yugoslavs began allowing  
people to cross into Albania late Friday at Morina, along the road 
from the Kosovo city of Prizren to northern Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours after the border station was reopened, Agneli said,  
about 1,500 people had crossed into Albania. He said OSCE monitors 
reported that most of the refugees appeared to have come from a 
village about three miles west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees said Serb police ordered them to leave their  
village about noon Friday. Serb authorities escorted them to the 
border and ordered them across, Agneli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid workers earlier said they had seen dozens of children  
fleeing across Albania's mountainous borders on bicycles, ominously 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very worrying because the children are in a state of  
shock and can't tell us what has happened to their family,'' UNICEF 
spokeswoman Marie Heuze said in Geneva. ``They aren't in a fit 
state to tell to tell us information and we can't push them too 
hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Macedonia, U.N. workers started collecting evidence and  
testimony from refugees for any war-crimes trials that might come 
from the conflict between Yugoslavia and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	And Ogata, acknowledging reports that Macedonian security forces  
were abusing the refugees, said she would ask NATO troops to remain 
in the camps to protect the ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO forces are now doing much of the grunt work of running the  
camps -- handing out milk and bread in food lines, tracking down 
blankets for children. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesmen in Macedonia said the alliance planned to turn  
the work over to UNHCR and start pulling out of the first camps 
within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Albania, Macedonia has been reluctant to take in refugees  
and has acknowledged at least one instance of security forces who 
guard the camps' perimeters beating a resident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for the time being, it would be important to ask NATO  
to maintain security,'' Ogata told reporters in Skopje, the 
Macedonian capital. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half the refugees from Kosovo have been taken in by  
private citizens, mostly fellow ethnic Albanians, the UNHCR said. 
The rest are in camps that have sprung up in Albania and Macedonia 
over the past week; Ogata said by now she believed all the refugees 
in Macedonia at least had a roof -- or tent -- over the heads and 
food to eat. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of the refugees already have been airlifted to camps  
in other countries, mostly Germany, Norway and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogata indicated plans by the United States and Canada to send  
more than 20,000 refugees to North America were on hold for now, in 
an effort to keep them closer to the province they left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	While ``these generous offers are very much appreciated,'' the  
preference is to keep the refugees in temporary camps in the region 
until they can return home, Ogata said. 
</P>
<P>
	One threadbare 14-year-old refugee boy burst past officials  
during Ogata's guided tour of the camp Friday, demanding when he 
could return to Kosovo, and inviting her to come too. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogata reached out and gave him a reassuring pat.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to go back there, too,'' she said. ``We can go  
back when we can go there safely.''

	Thousands of the refugees already have been airlifted to camps  
in other countries, mostly Germany, Norway and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogata indicated plans by the United States and Canada to send  
more than 20,000 refugees to North America were on hold for now, in 
an effort to keep them closer to the province they left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	While ``these generous offers are very much appreciated,'' the  
preference is to keep the refugees in temporary camps in the region 
until they can return home, Ogata said. 
</P>
<P>
	One threadbare 14-year-old refugee boy burst past officials  
during Ogata's guided tour of the camp Friday, demanding when he 
could return to Kosovo, and inviting her to come too. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogata reached out and gave him a reassuring pat.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to go back there, too,'' she said. ``We can go  
back when we can go there safely.''

<HEADLINE> Air Force Titan Rocket Is Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- An Air Force rocket thundered into  
space with a missile-warning satellite Friday in the first Titan IV 
flight since a spectacular $1 billion launch explosion last August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titan IV-B -- the nation's largest unmanned rocket -- hoisted  
a Pentagon satellite capable of detecting missile launches as well 
as nuclear blasts. The Air Force put the cost of the mission at 
$682 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything seemed to go well during the early stages of the  
flight. Liftoff, though, was 1 1/2 hours late; workers fell behind in 
their work at the pad, then launch controllers had to wait for a 
Russian satellite and a piece of U.S. space junk to pass overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time a Titan IV took off, carrying a spy satellite, the  
flight lasted just 41 seconds before the rocket blew up. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety percent of the wreckage was pulled from the Atlantic and  
helped investigators pinpoint the cause -- faulty wiring -- and also 
helped them make design changes. The investigation cost more than 
$45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly launched satellite -- essentially a 2 1/2-ton infrared  
telescope -- should become operational in three to six months. It 
will not be rushed into service because of the fighting in 
Yugoslavia, said Lt. Col. Craig Lowery, chief of the warning 
operations branch at the Air Force Space Command. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowery would not say how many such Defense Support Program  
satellites are functioning in orbit, but stressed their coverage is 
complete and worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our eyes never blink,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Another such satellite is supposed to go up in December.

<HEADLINE>  Berra Ends Boycott of Yankee Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wandering through the halls that twist and turn  
in the catacombs of Yankee Stadium, Yogi Berra could have used a 
road map. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to find my way back,'' Berra said after ending a 14-year  
exile and returning to throw out the first pitch on opening day 
Friday. ``I got lost. I've got to get my bearings. It's a lot 
different. They fixed it up so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra took over the first-pitch role that Joe DiMaggio held for  
so long. The team remembered DiMaggio, who died March 8 at age 84, 
with signs around the ballpark that quoted the Hall of Famer as 
saying, ``I want to thank the good Lord for making me a Yankee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the national anthem, Fans were asked to remember the  
Yankee Clipper with a moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Berra walked slowly out of the Yankees dugout, favoring a  
gimpy right knee, as a sellout Stadium crowd roared. 
</P>
<P>
	After Bob Sheppard introduced him as ``a great leader and a man  
of conviction,'' Berra tossed the ceremonial pitch from in front of 
the mound to catcher Joe Girardi. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra, who played for 10 World Series championship teams with  
the Yankees, vowed he would never return to the Stadium after owner 
George Steinbrenner fired him as manager after just 16 games in 
1985. He resisted repeated overtures to return for games, even when 
former teammates attempted to intercede. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been asking him to come back for years,'' said old  
batterymate Whitey Ford, who joined Phil Rizzuto to raise the 1998 
World Series championship banner. ``I told him, `I don't care what 
you think of Steinbrenner, the people miss you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	This winter, spurred by DiMaggio's illness, Steinbrenner  
apologized to Berra and the feud was settled. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra arrived at the Stadium early Friday and visited interim  
manager Don Zimmer, a friend who coached with Berra during one of 
Billy Martin's terms as Yankee manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yogi and I became really close the last three years,'' said  
Zimmer, who returned to the team in 1996 as bench coach for Joe 
Torre. ``Yogi would call me four or five times each summer, saying, 
`How ya doin', kid? How ya doin', kid?' We became very close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the moments before the first pitch, Berra sat on the Yankees  
bench, flanked by his two pals, Zimmer on one side, Ford on the 
other. The Yankees cap fit just like the old days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little nervous out there,'' he said. ``The first day,  
you're always a little nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially after 14 years away.  
</P>
<P>
	Berra said the feud with Steinbrenner never affected his  
feelings for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always a Yankees fan,'' he said. ``I rooted for them. I  
watched on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, it was time for the quarrel to be settled.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was happy to come in today,'' Berra said. ``I'm glad it's  
over with. It's good to be back. Everything worked out fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra said he'd return to the Stadium later this month when the  
Yankees unveil a monument to DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe some other games, too,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ford was surprised to be included in first-day ceremonies. He  
said he remembered pennants being raised. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was usually in the bullpen, warming up,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Then, in the stream of consciousness fashion that is uniquely  
Yogi, Berra wondered out loud about the flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was it heavy?'' he asked Ford.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nah,'' the old pitcher replied. ``I was worried about Rizzuto,  
though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No problem. The banner went up without a hitch and so did  
Berra's first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not bad,'' Berra said. ``I thought I'd do worse, but I  
did all right.''

<HEADLINE> Police Agree To U.S. Traffic Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police chiefs from some of the nation's  
largest departments said today they will create a national traffic 
stop policy that they said will ensure that minorities are not 
unfairly targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	The police chiefs made the announcement at a news conference  
with minority activists to launch what they described as an honest 
discussion on police and race. It came after a day of closed door 
meetings between police executives and community leaders 
coordinated by the Police Executive Research Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are to deal with it, we must stipulate that race is an  
issue in policing,'' Philadelphia Police Commissioner John Timoney 
said. ``There are an awful lot of people in denial, but so be it. 
We must move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public attention has been focused on police conduct since  
February's fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx borough of 
New York City. Four officers from New York's elite street crimes 
unit fired 41 shots at Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant, 
hitting him 19 times. His killing prompted numerous protests in New 
York and Washington. The officers have been charged with 
second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The still-evolving traffic stop policy would stress courtesy to  
build respect between minorities and police. One guideline being 
discussed would require officers to tell drivers why they had been 
stopped and to apologize if no violations are found. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department is investigating allegations of racial  
profiling -- targeting minorities for an unjustified amount of 
police attention -- by the New Jersey State Police and by police 
agencies in Eastpointe, Mich., and Orange County, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, Gov. Christie Whitman fired State Police  
Superintendent Carl Williams following published remarks in which 
he said minorities were responsible for most of the cocaine and 
marijuana traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno expressed serious concerns about  
racial profiling in comments to reporters Thursday, and she 
discussed it at a private meeting with the gathered police chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 35 chiefs and activists at the conference also  
discussed adopting a program like one used in San Diego where 
police record the race of people they stop. That data is used to 
assess whether police are, in fact, relying on racial profiling in 
making traffic stops. 
</P>
<P>
	But Baltimore Police Chief Thomas Frazier, president of the  
Police Executive Research Forum, said no consensus had yet been 
reached on whether it would be workable for a national model. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said that without a meaningful way  
of tracking who was being stopped by police and why, the traffic 
stop policy would be ``only window dressing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it will eliminate the problem at all because  
you're still going to have one person's word against the other, and 
one of those people is a cop,'' said Meeks, a member of the 
Congressional Black Caucus. ``It's meaningless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frazier said there were no plans to create a national policy on  
controversial stop-and-frisk practices like those used by the 
NYPD's street crimes unit. Such procedures are largely governed by 
individual states' case law, and it creating a national model would 
be difficult, he said.

more than 200 newspapers in 24 states. Liberty Group, based in 
Northbrook, owns 269 community newspapers in 15 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction, expected to be completed within 45 to 60 days,  
still needs federal approval, and both sides need to hammer out the 
details, said Liberty Group chief financial officer Kevin O'Shea. 
No snags were expected in closing the deal as the companies have 
previously traded newspapers, he added.

<HEADLINE> Court Split on Alcohol-Fetus Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin's Supreme Court divided today  
over whether women can be charged with criminal offenses for 
alcohol abuse that harms a fetus. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-3 tie sends the case back to the state Court of the  
Appeals, which earlier had passed it along to the high court 
without ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson did not participate in the  
ruling because her son, a California attorney, had represented a 
group that filed a brief in the case, her office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Zimmerman was seeking to have the charges dropped and  
challenged a Racine County Circuit judge's refusal to dismiss them. 
</P>
<P>
	She was charged with attempted first-degree intentional homicide  
and first-degree reckless injury after her daughter was born in 
March 1996 with a 0.199 percent blood-alcohol level. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said she had been at a bar the day she gave birth to  
her daughter, and that she said at the hospital later that day she 
had been drinking to ``kill this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said that Zimmerman had sought to end the pregnancy  
because she had worries over the baby's race and the pain of 
childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had argued before the court in December that  
Zimmerman should be prosecuted for attempted murder based on the 
``born alive'' rule, which says that if a fetus suffers prenatal 
injury at the hands of a third party and is born alive, charges may 
be brought against the person. 
</P>
<P>
	When her baby was born, Zimmerman's blood-alcohol level exceeded  
0.30 percent. A level of 0.10 percent is considered evidence of 
intoxication under Wisconsin law. 
</P>
<P>
	In her appeal, Zimmerman said that her abuse of alcohol during  
her pregnancy was directed toward her own body and the fetus she 
carried -- not another human being. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmerman's lawyer, Priscilla Smith, told the court that if it  
allowed her client to be prosecuted, the ruling could toughen 
abortion laws and other rules about what people can do with their 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil libertarians and abortion-rights groups also have  
expressed concern about what future limits could be placed on women 
if the state prevails in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that it's a dangerous prosecution,'' said Margie  
Kelly, spokeswoman for the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, 
which handled Zimmerman's defense. ``If it goes forward, any 
dangerous behavior by a woman -- such as smoking or drinking alcohol 
-- could be the basis for a criminal charge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The daughter, now 3 and in foster care, had a low birthweight  
and mild physical abnormalities that doctors attributed to her 
mother's drinking, prosecutors said.

<HEADLINE> Rules Proposed for Cell Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Government advisers have proposed new  
guidelines to oversee federal financing of controversial research 
on cells taken from human embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal drafted by a 13-member committee would allow the  
National Institutes of Health to pay for research on ``master 
cells'' only if researchers adhered to strict guidelines that would 
control how the cells were obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	The cells, called pluripotent stem cells, are the building  
blocks for nearly all of the tissues in the body and are capable of 
growing virtually any human tissue. Researchers believe they can 
learn how to use the cells to make body parts or to correct some 
disorders, such as Parkinson's disease or diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	The cells, however, can only be obtained from human embryos or  
from very early fetuses. A federal law bans government funding of 
embryo research and severely restricts fetal research. At least 75 
members of Congress have said stem cells taken from human embryos 
are covered by the ban. Some religious organization also are 
opposed to the research. 
</P>
<P>
	Two privately funded researchers recently isolated pluripotent  
stem cells. NIH director Harold Varmus has proposed that these 
existing stem cell cultures are not covered by the ban because 
federal funds were not used to create them. 
</P>
<P>
	Varmus selected the committee to draw up rules to guide NIH  
should the agency decide to fund pluripotent stem cell research. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed guidelines made public Thursday, federal  
grants would be forbidden to researchers who propose, as part of 
their research, to create or destroy a human embryo. Because 
removing stem cells kills an embryo, this would prohibit federal 
funding for creating new cultures of embryonic stem cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rules also would forbid federal funding of research  
into the cloning of humans, or research that would create an embryo 
using stem cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, however, would permit federal support of research  
using existing stem cell cultures created by privately funded 
scientists, such as the two stem cell lines created recently. 
</P>
<P>
	New embryonic stem cell cultures could be used in federal  
research, the rules state, only if privately funded scientists 
obtained the cells from embryos that had been created for 
infertility treatment and were ``in excess of clinical need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Use of pluripotent stem cells from embryos created for research  
purposes also are forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
	Stem cells from fetuses can be used, the rules say, if they are  
obtained ``after a spontaneous abortion or induced abortion or 
after a stillbirth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory committee also recommended a strict process of  
informed consent requiring that donors of fetal tissue or embryos 
be told about the potential use of the specimens. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed system, a stem cell research grant  
application would be considered first by an NIH science committee. 
If that group approves, then an oversight committee would determine 
if the proposal complies with the guidelines. Only then could the 
grant be considered for final approval.

<HEADLINE> Braves Salute Hank Aaron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Hank Aaron remembers the hate mail, but time has  
erased much of the bitterness and now it's time to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves continued the healing process Thursday night  
with a season-long salute honoring Aaron on the 25th anniversary of 
his historic 715th home run that broke Babe Ruth's record. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig, NL president Len Coleman and Al Downing,  
the victim of Aaron's monumental homer, were among those on hand to 
honor Aaron during a 45-minute ceremony prior to the Braves' game 
against the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know 25 years ago ... when I hit that home run to beat the  
Babe's record, it was truly one of the most remarkable evenings 
that I have ever had in baseball,'' Aaron said after the sellout 
crowd of 47,225 at Turner Field gave him a two-minute standing 
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``But tonight tops it all,'' said Aaron, now 65 and a Braves  
senior vice president. ``This is truly a wonderful day for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tribute has helped Aaron, who finished his 23-year career  
with 755 home runs, forget his somewhat bittersweet memories of the 
chase to beat Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
	As he neared Ruth, Aaron received hundreds of thousands of  
parcels of mail, many filled with hatred because there were people 
who did not want a black man from Mobile, Ala., breaking Ruth's 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the hurt was then-commissioner Bowie Kuhn, who wasn't  
at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium on the night when Aaron broke the 
record. Kuhn was at a dinner in Cleveland, and sent one of his 
assistants, Monte Irvin, in his place. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you would have asked me 15 years ago, you would have found  
a much angrier person, but time has a way of healing things,'' he 
said during news conference, seated between his wife, Billye, and 
Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen him a few times since then,'' he said of Kuhn, ``but  
have not talked to him about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig, Braves chairman of the board Bill Bartholomay and Tom  
Johnson, chairman and CEO of Cable News Network, spoke glowingly of 
Aaron. Hall of Famers Lou Brock, Frank Robinson and Phil Niekro 
also took part in the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron was honored with video tributes and two songs performed by  
Kenny Rogers -- ``The Greatest'' and ``Heroes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The finale was the unveiling of the Hank Aaron Award, which was  
announced in February. The award will go to the best hitter in each 
league each year, said Selig, who called it the equivalent of the 
Cy Young Award and the Most Valuable Player. 
</P>
<P>
	``You brought us joy and you brought us honor and it is a  
privilege to honor you tonight,'' Selig told Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig, in a news conference earlier, presented the award -- a  
wooden plaque with an engraved silver bat atop home plate -- to 
Aaron, as the first winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why so long? That's a tough question to answer,'' Selig said.  
``But I think this is the appropriate time. It's something that 
should have happened long ago. Like a lot of things in life, I wish 
it had been a happier experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The celebration was the first that will take place during the  
regular season at major league parks to celebrate Aaron's feat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just enjoying the moment,'' Aaron's wife said. ``It's just  
been uphill and a wonderful, wonderful experience of making up for 
all that didn't happen 25 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron began his major league career in 1953 and spent his entire  
career in Milwaukee or Atlanta, breaking Ruth's record of 714 
career home runs on April 8, 1974 in the fourth inning off Downing 
of the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball sailed over the left-center field fence at  
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, just across the street from the 
current stadium, as the crowd of 53,775 roared. It was caught in 
the bullpen by Braves reliever Tom House at 9:07 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a cold night, but it was a very good night,'' Aaron  
recalled. ``I guess you could say I was nervous, like I am 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron played two more years in Milwaukee before retiring.  
</P>
<P>
	He has more RBIs (2,297), extra-base hits (1,477) and total  
bases (6,856) than anyone. He ranks second in at-bats (12,364) and 
runs (2,174), third in games (3,298) and hits (3,771), and ninth in 
doubles (624). During a 23-year career, he batted .305. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, President Clinton led a celebration in Atlanta of  
Aaron's 65th birthday, and baseball named the hitting award for 
Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the charity event raised $1 million for The Chasing  
The Dream Foundation, started five years ago by the Aarons for 
underprivileged youngsters. The check was presented to Aaron by 
CNN's Johnson during the ceremony.

<HEADLINE> 'Conceive-A-Thon' for Y2K Baby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- For most couples, starting a family is a private  
affair -- a candlelit dinner, romantic music, maybe some silky 
lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
	Not for four Massachusetts couples.  
</P>
<P>
	The couples are competing to conceive the nation's first  
millennium baby. They're in separate rooms in a Boston hotel today, 
considered the optimal conception day for a Jan. 1, 2000 birth. 
</P>
<P>
	If one of the couples bears the first baby born in the United  
States next year, the parents will receive a check for $1 million, 
courtesy of radio station WJMN. 
</P>
<P>
	The couples -- Darren and Saundra Mendalka of Winthrop, Cochise  
and Laurel Pearsen of Boston, Derrick and Bobbi Milso of Weymouth, 
and Greg and Trina Hackett of Lynn -- were selected out of hundreds 
of radio station callers. 
</P>
<P>
	Any birth must be natural -- no Caesarean sections or inducements  
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it's normally not so public,'' Mrs. Mendalka said. ``I  
called my mother and I said, `How does it feel to have a daughter 
that's going to be in the public and everybody knows that she's 
going to have sex tomorrow?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The odds against the aspiring parents are long. Obstetricians  
warn that babies arrive when they want over a period of weeks, not 
seconds.

<HEADLINE> Japan Sticks to Economic Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's top economic official on Friday stood by  
the government's forecast of 0.5 percent growth for the coming 
year, despite signs that the country is not close to pulling out of 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's economy shrank 0.8 percent in the last three months of  
1998, and is expected to have shrunk for the second year in a row 
when statistics for the fiscal year that ended March 31 emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent analysts expect the economy to shrink yet again in  
the fiscal year that just began. 
</P>
<P>
	But Taichi Sakaiya, the director general of Japan's Economic  
Planning Agency, said the government's record spending and tax-cut 
program would spur the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although I can't say it absolutely, I have considerable  
confidence'' that the official growth target of 0.5 percent will be 
reached this fiscal year, Sakaiya told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has pledged to  
avoid three fiscal years in a row of contraction. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy shrank 0.4 percent in the 1997-98 fiscal year and is  
expected to shrink more than 2 percent in the just-ended fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, Takafusa Shioya, the deputy director-general of the  
Economic Planning Agency, said there would probably not be any 
major changes in the agency's assessment of the economy in its next 
monthly report. 
</P>
<P>
	In its March report, the EPA described conditions as ``extremely  
severe,'' but said the economy's ``downward movement continues to 
slow to a halt.' 
</P>
<P>
	A string of Japanese government officials have voiced optimism  
about the economy recently, declaring that it had hit its lowest 
point and would now begin to recover from its worst recession since 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura was quoted as telling a group  
of four U.S. congressmen Friday that the Japanese economy ``is 
poised to bottom out and to move upward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Komura made the remarks during a 30-minute meeting with the  
delegation led by Bill Young, a Republican from Florida, who is 
chairman of the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee, 
a Foreign Ministry official was quoted as saying by Kyodo News 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The three others are committee members Ralph Regula, an Ohio  
Republican, George Nethercut, a Washington Republican, and Allen 
Boyd, a Florida Democrat.

<HEADLINE> Paper: G.M To Build Lansing Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- General Motors Corp. could break ground as  
early as this fall on a $350 million assembly plant in Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant would produce Cadillacs and would be the first new  
assembly plant built by GM since the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, 
Tenn., opened in 1990, The Detroit News reported Friday. It would 
also be the first new GM plant built in Michigan since the Detroit 
Hamtramck factory opened in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	GM will have to undergo negotiations with the United Auto  
Workers over rules and employment levels. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said the proposed plant would build 211,000 Sigma cars, which  
will be a new line of rear-wheel-drive cars. Analysts say the Sigma 
line of luxury cars is scheduled to go on sale in mid-2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get all of the approvals -- mutually beneficial labor  
agreements, guarantees from all involved parties that the program 
will be profitable, tax incentives, and a final OK from the GM 
board of directors, we want to start construction immediately,'' GM 
spokesman Kyle Johnson told the News on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's plans to break ground on another Lansing-area plant that  
will build small cars is also pending the outcome of talks with the 
UAW. It plans to make a formal proposal to the UAW on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't seen what they plan in any detail,'' UAW Local 652  
president Ralph Shepard said Thursday. ``But without the new 
plants, we'll have nothing.''

<HEADLINE> Compton Takes Pole for Truck Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- Stacy Compton, who has managed  
top-three finishes in all three of this season's NASCAR Craftsman 
Truck Series races, will start from the pole position in Saturday's 
Dodge California Truck Stop 300. 
</P>
<P>
	Compton didn't threaten Ron Hornaday's track record, qualifying  
Friday in unseasonably cool conditions, but still edged Greg Biffle 
by two-hundredths of a second to win his third career pole. The 
Hurt, Va., driver, whose team switched from Fords to Dodges this 
season, most recently was fastest qualifier in August 1998 at 
Flemington, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Compton lapped the half-mile oval at a speed of 95.092, while  
Biffle's Ford lapped at 95.022. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornaday, who holds a 40-point championship lead over Compton,  
qualified third. His Chevrolet Silverado ran a fast lap of 94.847. 
</P>
<P>
	Compton finished third in the race last year, regaining a lap  
lost to a flat tire, and was second in his first Mesa Marin 
appearance in 1997. He hopes starting first will give the team the 
momentum to gain its third series victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe this is what we need to get a win here,'' he said. ``I  
like long races on slick tracks. We've got a great opporunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Bakersfield resident Kevin Harvick qualified his Ford  
fourth at 94.568. Veteran Jimmy Hensley, who drives a Dodge Ram 
owned by Richard Petty, was fifth at 94.275. 
</P>
<P>
	Former series champion Jack Sprague will start the $337,400 race  
from sixth, followed by Mike Bliss, 1998 race winner Dennis Setzer, 
Mike Wallace and B.A. Wilson.

<HEADLINE> Indians To Face Tougher Tax Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Interior Department wants to make it  
tougher for Indian tribes to avoid paying taxes on land they 
acquire off their reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under rules proposed Thursday, the department said it would  
start giving greater weight to local concerns when deciding whether 
to take tribal lands into trust. Federal trust status removes the 
land from tax rolls and exempts it from zoning controls and other 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribes made wealthy by gambling interests have stepped up their  
purchases of land on and off their reservations, leading to 
conflicts with local communities. Last year, the department refused 
to let Minnesota's small Shakopee Mdewakanton tribe remove from the 
tax rolls 593 acres of land it had purchased near its reservation 
in the Minneapolis suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``In restructuring the regulations, we believe that the  
decision-making process will better reflect the present-day needs 
and concerns of Indian tribes and surrounding non-Indian 
communities,'' Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribes often must buy land outside their reservations if they  
want to diversify economically, and they can't control the property 
adequately unless it is put into trust, said Ron Allen, president 
of the National Congress of American Indians and chairman of 
Washington's Jamestown S'Klallam tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to make it very difficult for a lot of tribes, both  
small and large,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules would make it easier for tribes to get trust status  
for lands acquired within their reservation boundaries. In such 
cases, the application process would be streamlined and there would 
be a strong presumption in favor of the tribe, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribes have long since lost much of the land they once owned on  
their reservations because of the government's 19th century 
allotment policies. About 8 percent of the land lost through 
allotment has been reacquired. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the land-into-trust applications that the department  
receives are for small parcels, averaging 30 acres in size, within 
reservation boundaries.

<HEADLINE> Evel Knievel Back in Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A week ago, Evel Knievel was in a posh Strip  
resort, talking about his liver transplant giving him a new lease 
on life. Today he was back in the hospital, talking about the liver 
possibly being rejected and what fate might have in store for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Friday, though, hospital spokeswoman Ann Lynch said  
doctors determined the liver had not been rejected but Knievel's 
body was ``just being attacked by hepatitis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was released from the hospital late in the day.  
</P>
<P>
	Knievel, 60, received a lifesaving liver transplant in Tampa,  
Fla., two months ago. He said he had been waiting for a new liver 
to replace one wracked by hepatitis C he says was caused by years 
of blood transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my body is rejecting the liver or my hepatitis C is  
coming back and overtaking my liver,'' Knievel said earlier in the 
day, speaking softly from his bed at Sunrise Hospital and Medical 
Center. ``I've been feeling weak and dizzy and tired.''

<HEADLINE> Banshee Breeze Wins Apple Blossom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- Trainer Carl Nafzger sized up  
Manistique as the best filly in the west, Sister Act as the best in 
the Midwest and his filly, Banshee Breeze, as tops in the east. 
</P>
<P>
	They met Friday in the $500,000 Apple Blossom Handicap and  
Banshee Breeze rallied from about 10 lengths off the pace to beat a 
very game Sister Act by 1 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	So, Nafzger was asked, what does that make his filly?  
</P>
<P>
	``The best,'' he said. ``No. 1.''  
</P>
<P>
	As the 3-5 favorite, Banshee Breeze paid $3.40, $2.20 and $2.20.  
Sister Act, the third choice at 3-1, returned $2.60 and $2.20. She 
finished more than nine lengths in front of Silent Eskimo, who paid 
$2.20. Manistique, whose only loss in eight previous races was to 
Banshee Breeze at Saratoga last August, faded to fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Banshee Breeze finished 1 1-16 miles in 1:41 3-5 in beating five  
others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can really train as long as I've got her,'' Nafzger said.  
``Every day we run her, she impresses me more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a half mile, she was fifth, far behind Sister Act.  
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Bailey tapped her to get her into the race as the leaders  
neared the far turn. Banshee Breeze began closing the gap and then 
moved to the outside in the turn and passed three horses easily. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of the stretch she was even with Sister Act.  
</P>
<P>
	Bailey hit Banshee Breeze right-handed and a split second later  
Calvin Borel whipped Sister Act left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey hit Banshee Breeze two more times and Borel continued to  
whip left-handed. In the final 100 yards, Bailey hit Banshee Breeze 
a fourth and final time and looked to make certain nobody was 
sneaking up on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Banshee Breeze won for the eighth time in 13 starts and the  
$300,000 check upped her career earnings to $1,845,980. 
</P>
<P>
	Her only loss in her last six races was by a nose to Escena in  
the Breeder's Cup Distaff last November.

<HEADLINE> Masters Changes Not Showing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- The rough really isn't much shaggier than  
the fairways at a local municipal. And the par-5s are still mostly 
reachable for both the long and the daring. 
</P>
<P>
	The players say Augusta National is playing tougher, but the  
scores don't really bear that out. 
</P>
<P>
	Halfway through the Masters, Nick Price believes the most  
notable effect of all the changes may be that the green jacket 
won't necessarily be won in a putting contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys who were the best chippers and the best putters from  
30 feet and in always to me seemed to have a distinct advantage on 
this golf course,'' Price said. ``Now they've brought the ball 
strikers back into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest course changes made in the history of the Masters  
have been well received by most players. Masters officials should 
also be pleased that they have made just subtle differences and 
haven't sent all scores soaring. 
</P>
<P>
	Through two rounds, the scoring average is 74.3, about a  
quarter-shot a round higher than last year and just above the 74.2 
average since 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly, the changes have made for some new and different shots  
from the tees and fairways -- and especially the rough, which takes 
off the spin needed to control shots into the hard and undulating 
greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``The course is more demanding now than it was before,'' said  
leader Jose Maria Olazabal, who won here in 1994. ``The second cut 
(of rough) doesn't allow you to control the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That has helped position players like Price and U.S. Open  
champion Lee Janzen, who may take more pride in their ability to 
hit fairways and create shots than they do in putting. 
</P>
<P>
	It may also explain how a guy who quit the game because he  
couldn't putt and is now playing with a long putter (Scott 
McCarron) can be in contention. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I heard there was going to be a little rough, I was  
excited about that,'' Janzen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Janzen, who has never finished in the top 10 in seven previous  
Masters, shot a 69 Friday to get to 5-under for the tournament, 
three shots behind Olazabal. 
</P>
<P>
	Price was even par for the day and still in the hunt for his  
first Masters title at 3-under for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tried to make the course harder the correct way instead  
of making the greens so firm and so fast where it really played in 
the hands of the guys who had the greatest short games,'' Price 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Price won a British Open and two PGA's playing on courses that  
demanded great accuracy and shotmaking skills. Before this year, 
the fairways of Augusta National seemed to stretch forever, with no 
rough to penalize errant shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Price hasn't finished better than 18th since 1993, and missed  
three of the last six cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just always felt this golf course suited a particular type  
of player's game, someone who hit the ball long and high and 
someone who was chipping and putting exceptional,'' Price said. ``I 
didn't fit in that category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the changes made some holes play tougher, others just  
seemed tougher. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 15th hole, David Duval made an eight even after laying up  
on his second shot. It was one of four ``others'' and 15 double 
bogeys recorded there in two days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year we play 15 it gets tougher and tougher, I don't  
know why,'' said Olazabal, who birdied the hole after a delicate 
little chip that stopped inches from the flagstick. ``After the 
drive every shot on that hole is a scary shot.''

<HEADLINE> Three Charged in Rapper's Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three men were charged in last month's shooting  
death of rapper Freaky Tah of the hit hip-hop group the Lost Boyz. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelvin Jones, 29, Raheem Fletcher, 22 and Ryan Frith, 24, all of  
New York, face second-degree murder charges in the death of the 
rapper, whose real name was Raymond Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, the alleged gunman, was arrested Wednesday in Albany, New  
York police spokesman George Nagy said. Frith, who allegedly drove 
a van used in the shooting, was arrested Thursday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Fletcher, who police believe provided the van, has been in  
custody since last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers, 27, was slain March 28 as he left a party in Queens. A  
gunman approached him from behind and shot him once without 
speaking, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagy said the slaying was part of an ongoing dispute, the  
details of which were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lost Boyz, four boyhood friends who admitted to being former  
small-time drug dealers, had a best-selling album in 1996 called 
``Legal Drug Money.'' The title was a reference to going straight 
after seeing a fellow drug dealer shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Among there other hits are the singles ``Me and My Crazy  
World,'' ``Music Makes Me High'' and ``Get Up'' and the album 
``Love, Peace &AMP; Nappiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other nationally known rappers have been shot to death in  
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapper and actor Tupac Shakur, who had multimillion-seller  
albums like ``2Pacalypse Now'' and ``All Eyez on Me,'' was killed 
in September 1996 as he sat in a car in Las Vegas. He was 25. In 
March 1997, 24-year-old rapper Christopher Wallace, known as 
Notorious B.I.G. or Biggie Smalls, was shot to death in a drive-by 
shooting in Los Angeles. Among his hits was ``Ready to Die.''

<HEADLINE> Tutu To Continue Teaching at Emory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Archbishop Desmond Tutu isn't done at Emory  
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Tutu is teaching two courses at Candler School of Theology, and  
will be back next year, the school announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Archbishop Tutu's very public commitment to human rights and  
his singular ministry to the people of South Africa has made a 
profound impact on Candler as he shares his unique insights in the 
classroom,'' Dean Kevin LaGree said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Tutu received an honorary degree from the university in 1988 and

<HEADLINE> Former Cub Pitcher Dead at 87 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Clay Bryant, who pitched for the  
Chicago Cubs in the 1938 World Series, died Friday. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant, who also coached for the Los Angeles Dodgers and  
Cleveland Indians, died at Hospice by the Sea in Boca Raton, Fla, 
his son Chuck Bryant said. He gave no cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Birmingham, Ala., the elder Bryant joined the Cubs  
in 1935, compiling a 32-20 record before an arm injury cut short 
his career. Bryant posted a 9-3 record in 1937 and was 19-11 as he 
helped pitch the Cubs into the 1938 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the 5-2 loser in the third game of a four-game sweep by  
the New York Yankees. Bryant resumed his baseball career in 1944 as 
manager of the Newark team in the Ohio State League and made his 
home in Zanesville, Ohio, before moving to Mobile, Ala., and then 
to Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
	After managing in the Dodgers minor league system, Bryant was  
named third base coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1961. He 
served Cleveland as a pitching coach in 1967 and 1974 and managed 
two minor league teams for the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the survivors are his wife, Opal, and sons Charles and  
Clay Jr. Services were pending.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Man Dies After Killing Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- An abusive husband killed his common-law wife by  
setting her on fire, then died in an explosion when he appparently 
yanked out a natural gas line in hopes of making the blaze look 
accidental. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said William Reese, 45, doused Rosemary Flournoy, 41,  
with gasoline and set her on fire early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	As the flames engulfed Ms. Flournoy, Reese apparently wrenched a  
gas line loose, causing an explosion that killed him and blew out a 
chunk of wall in their four-unit apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard Rosie yelling, `Help me! I can't get out, I can't get  
out,''' said Rebecca Murphy, a neighbor who had been awakened by 
the sound of breaking glass. ``As we were heading out the door, I 
heard a big boom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A badly burned Ms. Flournoy died in a hospital.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Murphy, who had been friends with Reese and Ms. Flournoy  
since they moved in 3 1/2 years ago, said she had been ``afraid 
something bad was going to happen.'' The couple had had a 15-year 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``She took a lot off him,'' said Ms. Murphy, 30. ``People say  
when you take a lot of abuse, you love them. I don't see how.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reese had arrests for murder, robbery, burglary, battery and  
theft. Most of the charges, including a 1993 murder charge, were 
dismissed. The stiffest penalty he got was probation and a $350 
fine for a 1981 larceny. 
</P>
<P>
	Battery and false-imprisonment charges were pending against him  
for allegedly tying Ms. Flournoy to their bed with an extension 
cord in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The police report said he told her ``he was not going to let her  
out, feed her or allow her to go to work.'' She managed to wriggle 
free, crawl out a window and run to a police station. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese was jailed for two months before Ms. Flournoy asked a  
judge to send him home because she couldn't afford the $350-a-month 
rent without him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Murphy said Reese would spend his time in jail writing poems  
and drawing pictures of the couple in wedding attire. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was nicer to her when he was in jail,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Four Amateurs Make Masters Cut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Bobby Jones must be proud.  
</P>
<P>
	Four amateurs made the cut in the Masters for the first time in  
14 years, led by British Amateur champion Sergio Garcia and 1998 
sensation Matt Kuchar. 
</P>
<P>
	The play-without-pay group fulfilled the prediction of Charlie  
Yates, host of the annual Amateur Dinner the night before the 
opening round. The man who played in the first Masters alongside 
Jones told the assembled group they were the best collection of 
amateurs he's seen in years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've demonstrated that,'' said the 19-year-old  
Garcia, who shot a 75 Friday and heads to the weekend with a 
3-over-par 147. 
</P>
<P>
	Amateurs have always held a special place in the Masters in  
tribute to Jones, who never turned pro. Spots are held for the U.S. 
Amateur champion and runner-up, the British Amateur champion and 
the winners of the U.S. Mid-Amateur and U.S. Amateur Public Links. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Amateur Dinner, Yates tells the players about Jones'  
contributions to amateur golf, how the Masters began and reminds 
them that no amateur has ever won the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	That is not likely to change this year -- Garcia and Tom McKnight  
were 11 shots behind lead Jose Maria Olazabal -- but it has been an 
impressive performance nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	McKnight, 44, who qualified as runner-up in the U.S. Amateur,  
works as a petroleum distributor in Virginia and also owns several 
convenience stores. He gave up his pro career in 1984 after 
breaking his arm in a pick-up basketball game, the doctors telling 
him he wouldn't be able to compete at the highest level. 
</P>
<P>
	So much for that diagnosis.  
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar, who a year ago became the first amateur since 1984 to  
finish even-par in the Masters, bounced back from a 77 on Thursday 
to shoot a 1-under 71. He snuck in right at the 148 cut-line along 
with South African Trevor Immelman, the Public Links champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be really nice to play the next two days and get a  
whole lot more experience,'' said Immelman, who followed his 
first-round 72 with a staying-alive 76. ``My goal coming here was 
not to make the cut, not to win, not to make the top 10. I just 
wanted to play to my potential and take what I can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, amateurs Sam Randolph, Jerry Haas, Jay Sigel and John  
Inman got to play on the weekend, but only twice since then had as 
many as two amateurs made the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, only two amateurs fell short. U.S. champion Hank  
Kuehne dropped from contention with a 6-over 42 on the back nine 
Friday, while Mid-Amateur champion John Miller was never a factor, 
finishing 14 strokes away from the cut with back-to-back 81s. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar, who came to Augusta suffering from the flu, was still  
ailing during the first round. Wobbling around the course in the 
90-degree heat, his iron game was erratic and he seemed likely to 
miss the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kuchar felt better when he awoke Friday and the temperatures  
were cooler, the sun hidden most of the day behind thick waves of 
clouds. The boyish smile, rarely seen Thursday, returned to his 
face after he made the turn and headed toward Amen Corner at 
6-over. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar put together a 4-under stretch on Nos. 12-14, sandwiching  
two birdies around an eagle at the par-5 13th when he holed out 
from the front bunker. He followed that by chipping in from the 
fringe at 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was quite exciting,'' Kuchar said. ``I only needed my  
putter once in three holes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar bogeyed the final two holes, missing a 6-foot putt at 18,  
but his score was still good enough to make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm on the bubble,'' he said. ``It's not the best spot to be  
in. I wish that last putt had dropped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKnight, in the true amateur mold, had to make time in his work  
schedule to prepare for the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like cramming for an exam,'' he said. ``I practiced so  
much the last three weeks, I wore myself out. I had to go to the 
chiropractor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's feeling fine and has no complaints about playing two  
more rounds this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones would have been cheering him on.

<HEADLINE> Rich Taxpayers Reap More Rewards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When it comes to paying income taxes, it seems  
the rich indeed do get richer -- but only if they charge tax bills 
on their credit cards to rack up airline frequent flier miles and 
other rewards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest surprise we've had in the program is the people  
who want to pay more than $100,000,'' said Steve Johnson, senior 
vice president at U.S. Audiotex, a California company running the 
new credit card program for the Internal Revenue Service. ``They 
want the miles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time this year, people can call an Audiotex  
toll-free number -- 1-888-2PAYTAX -- to pay their federal income tax 
bills using an American Express, MasterCard or Discover card. Visa, 
the largest credit card issuer, is taking a wait-and-see approach 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though taxpayers must pay a service fee averaging 2.5  
percent to use plastic, interest is running high among some of the 
well-heeled who determine the airline miles or other rewards are 
worth the price. Some want to pay bills of $1 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you run the numbers, some of these people who have a  
payment due figure there's a benefit to it,'' said Bob Barr, 
assistant IRS commissioner for electronic taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the big tax charges are coming from American Express  
cardholders, because they have no preset spending limit, Johnson 
said. About 50 people have asked to pay seven-figure amounts, 
including one person who sought to pay a $9 million bill. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express spokeswoman Judy Tenzer said many cardholders  
are enrolled in the company's ``Membership Rewards'' program, which 
also has no limit and converts dollars charged into frequent flier 
miles and points for free products ranging from music CDs to pearl 
necklaces to vacations in such places as British Columbia, Costa 
Rica or Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they are using checks, they're not getting anything in  
return,'' Tenzer said. ``While the size of these charges may be 
surprising, there are so many different things you can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Express is accepting such charges on a case-by-case  
basis after talking with the cardholder. One concern is that 
someone could escape paying the tax by putting the amount on a 
card, then declaring bankruptcy, knowing credit card bills rank 
lower than Uncle Sam when bankruptcy courts determine which debts 
get paid first. 
</P>
<P>
	Some large tax payments have also been made with MasterCard,  
which is issued through a bank or other financial institution and 
does have credit limits. Spokeswoman Lisa Brzezinski said approval 
of large charges above the limits is up to the issuer, but many 
cards are linked to particular airlines or other merchants and also 
offer rewards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frequent flier miles is definitely one of the reasons,'' she  
said. ``I think there is a convenience factor as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through April 2, IRS had received 5,400 credit card payments  
averaging $1,445. In addition to the toll-free number, taxpayers 
using Intuit's TurboTax and MacIntax software can use Discover or 
other Novus cards to pay online through those programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Another new method of payment is direct debit from a bank  
account for people who file electronically. Through last Friday, 
33,000 taxpayers had chosen these direct payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr said the IRS expects many more taxpayers planning to use  
credit cards -- particularly those with large bills -- will pay their 
taxes between now and the midnight deadline next Thursday. One 
thing to keep in mind, he said, is that the toll-free number will 
be operating until midnight Hawaiian time -- giving East Coast 
taxpayers extra time to meet the IRS deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year, the IRS is likely to add other types of taxes that  
can be paid with credit cards, Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are having a wildly successful season both in electronic  
filing and electronic payments,'' he said. ``Our folks are looking 
seriously at some other tax options.''

<HEADLINE> American, Attendants Agree on Reno </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines and its flight  
attendants' union have reached an agreement on how the airline will 
absorb Reno Air flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR, the airline's parent company, and the Association of  
Professional Flight Attendants did not disclose details of the 
plan, agreed on late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact covers issues such as seniority and pay for American  
and Reno flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants union and American still are negotiating a  
new contract. The existing agreement was reached after a five-day 
strike in November 1993 that virtually shut down American's 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	American and its pilots' union are still at odds over the  
acquisition of Reno. Their disagreement led to a massive sickout in 
February that caused the cancellation of nearly 6,700 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after ordering the pilots to end the sickout, U.S.  
District Judge Joe Kendall found the union in contempt of his 
order. On Monday, Kendall will begin hearing arguments about what 
damages the airline suffered from the job action. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides are also set to continue talks with a mediator.

<HEADLINE> IRS Warns Tax Filers: Don't Be Late </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A message to the 34 million or so taxpayers  
who haven't filed their income tax returns: This is the last 
weekend to get it all done before the April 15 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	There are ways to get extensions from the Internal Revenue  
Service, but they can make tax bills even higher. Tax experts agree 
it's a big mistake not to file something by Thursday's midnight 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst strategy, one that can add thousands of dollars to  
your tax bill, is to do nothing,'' said Lawrence Torella, an 
accountant and partner with Richard A. Eisner &AMP; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Torella said a ``whole new generation'' of taxpayers with  
problems filing returns on time could be created by income from the 
booming stock market, an increase in people who have stock options 
and windfalls from sales of small businesses. In addition, tax 
returns are more complex than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty for failing to file a tax return is 5 percent of the  
balance due per month, up to a maximum of 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers who aren't going to meet the filing deadline should  
send the IRS a request for extension until Aug. 16 using Form 4868, 
which is available on the Internet, IRS offices and some banks and 
post offices. The IRS automatically approves such requests. 
</P>
<P>
	But people seeking extensions should still pay an estimate of  
their taxes due, or at least as much as possible, by Thursday. 
Doing so will lessen the sting of interest -- now 8 percent on late 
payments -- and penalties of a half-percent per month. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS will refund any amount overpaid, once the final return  
is submitted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come in a little high,'' said IRS spokesman Don Roberts.  
``Whatever you have left, you're going to pay interest on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penalties for late tax payments drop to a quarter-percent per  
month if the taxpayer enters into an installment payment agreement 
with the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
	A request for such an installment plan, using Form 9465, can be  
attached to the tax return. The IRS almost always grants such 
requests as long as the taxpayer agrees to pay $25,000 or less 
within five years. There's a $43 fee to set up such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
	For reasons such as a death in the family or serious illness,  
the IRS sometimes waives late-payment penalties on returns filed on 
time. People should make such requests courteously and in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	One other note: The U.S. Tax Court has rejected claims from  
taxpayers who say accountants advised them to file returns late 
while collecting required documentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Through April 2, the IRS had received almost 70 million of the  
126 million tax returns expected this year. Counting estimates for 
this week, IRS spokesman Roberts said it's likely that 34 million 
taxpayers, or about 26 percent, will submit their returns in the 
next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Although refunds are running close to 20 percent ahead of last  
year and average $1,575, it's likely that people who owe taxes make 
up the bulk of the last-minute filers. And many people probably put 
off doing taxes last week because of the twin Easter and Passover 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really have only one good weekend in April to work on tax  
returns, instead of two,'' Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Last-minute forms from the IRS are available in several ways.  
The fastest is through the Internet at www.irs.ustreas.gov. 
Taxpayers also can call from a fax machine at 1-703-368-9694 and 
have a form faxed.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Eye Implants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of mildly nearsighted Americans won a  
radically new way to improve their vision without glasses or 
contact lenses today: The government approved tiny, transparent 
rings that are implanted directly onto the cornea. 
</P>
<P>
	KeraVision Inc.'s Intacs implants offer an alternative for some  
patients to popular but irreversible laser eye surgery, at about 
the same price. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly three out of four patients who tried the implants in  
clinical trials achieved 20/20 vision. But if patients don't like 
their Intacs, or suffer a side effect such as glare, doctors can 
remove the rings with a good chance of returning the eyes to 
pre-surgery condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration warned that the implants are  
only for mildly nearsighted people, whose vision is formally 
diagnosed as ``minus 1 diopters to minus 3 diopters.'' That roughly 
translates to vision ranging from 20/40 -- where it's OK to drive 
but a movie is blurry without glasses -- to about 20/300, where you 
can barely see the big ``E'' at the top of eye charts. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, laser surgery can sharpen the vision of people with  
much more severe nearsightedness. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the implants are ``really an interesting approach,'' said  
Dr. Susan Alpert, FDA's medical device evaluation chief. ``It is a 
simple procedure. ... These can remain in permanently, but if 
there's a problem, they can be removed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patients say that's the feature that makes Intacs attractive.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'd considered laser surgery, but one of the biggest things  
that scared us ... is that if it didn't work, there's no way to 
change that,'' said Fran Palek, a Tampa banker. So he, his wife, 
his neighbor and his neighbor's sister all tried the implants 
instead, and liked them. ``It's amazing,'' said Palek, 30, 
describing seeing with perfect vision immediately after the 
15-minute surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearsightedness occurs when the cornea, the membrane covering  
the front of the eye, is too steeply curved. Flattening the cornea 
helps correct nearsightedness. Hundreds of thousands of Americans 
have sought radial keratotomy, in which surgeons slice the cornea 
with a knife, or surgery with a laser that shaves the cornea to 
flatten it. 
</P>
<P>
	But those surgeries can be risky, sometimes causing problems  
with night vision, glare, seeing halos or blurry vision. Patients 
occasionally cannot see as well after surgery as before. Thus, most 
patients who choose these operations have fairly severe 
nearsightedness. 
</P>
<P>
	Intacs are two crescents about the thickness of a contact lens  
that form a ring around the cornea's edge. Their slight weight 
flattens the cornea without permanently destroying tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	During about a 15-minute operation, the doctor uses eye drops to  
numb the eye and cuts a tiny pocket into the cornea. A special 
device slips the crescents onto the cornea. A single stitch closes 
the wound. 
</P>
<P>
	In a yearlong study of 448 eyes, 97 percent saw 20/40 or better  
without glasses or contact lenses after the implant. About 74 
percent had 20/20 or better vision without glasses, and 53 percent 
could see 20/16 -- the sharper vision required of combat pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Most patients achieved good vision in the implanted eye a day  
after surgery. One eye is implanted at a time, in case patients 
have problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The implants are not risk-free: Some 7 percent to 17 percent of  
patients suffered side effects similar to laser surgery, including 
glare, halos and problems with night vision. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-nine patients had their implants removed, including 15  
who were dissatisfied with their vision correction and 19 who had 
visual side effects. Removing the implant corrected more than 80 
percent of those side effects, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	As nearsighted people age, they also frequently need reading  
glasses, and Intacs won't help with that, Alpert warned. Also, the 
FDA ordered KeraVision to study Intacs' long-term benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Intacs will cost between $2,000 and $2,500 per eye, about the  
same as laser surgery. They are available immediately in: 
Washington; Tampa, Fla.; Fayettesville, Ark.; St. Louis; Kansas 
City; New York City; Minneapolis; Portland, Ore.; Los Angeles; San 
Francisco; San Diego; and Atlanta. KeraVision is training doctors 
in other areas to implant Intacs, so they will be available 
nationwide later in the year.

<HEADLINE> DiCaprio Computer Center Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Leonardo DiCaprio movie posters cover the  
walls of the computer center at the new Los Feliz Branch Library, 
built on land where the actor's family home once stood. 
</P>
<P>
	The Leonardo DiCaprio Computer Center contains seven terminals  
with software to help students with math, language and study 
skills, library spokesman Peter Persic said Thursday at a 
ribbon-cutting ceremony for the branch. 
</P>
<P>
	DiCaprio and his family, who are longtime residents of the Los  
Feliz neighborhood, donated $35,000 to fund the computer center, 
Persic said. The ``Titanic'' actor did not attend the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are lots of books about Leonardo DiCaprio on the  
shelves, but I doubt they'll stay there for long,'' Persic said.

<HEADLINE> High School Pitcher Strikes Out Everyone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ADDISON, Texas (AP) -- High school pitcher Tony Adler savored  
baseball perfection that would make fellow Texans Roger Clemens and 
Kerry Wood envious. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching for Greenhill, Adler struck out all 18 Episcopal School  
of Dallas batters he faced in an 8-0 six-inning victory Tuesday. He 
did it with 75 pitches -- 55 of them strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Episcopal batters managed just five foul balls off the senior  
right-hander and none worked a full count. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had no-hitters here before, but nothing like this,''  
said Greenhill coach Mark Parachini, who has coached the team for 
15 years. ``I think everybody's still a little bit stunned about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adler's best pitch is the fastball. He threw 72 of them, with  
just three curveballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kidding around with the guys before the game, saying I  
was going to strike out everybody,'' said Adler, who has signed to 
play at Rice next year. ``I didn't even have a particularly good 
fastball. It was just one of those days where something happens. I 
don't really know how to explain it.''

<HEADLINE> Power Plants To Be Drilled for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Power plants across the country shared  
information via radio rather than computer Friday to test whether 
they could keep the lights on even if a Year 2000 bug knocked out 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's power grids depend on communications between  
generating stations so that operators can send electricity to 
regions that need it the most from power plants able to provide it. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, workers at hundreds of sites called in meter readings  
via handheld radios and logged in data on paper, rather than using 
computers hooked together via fiber-optic lines and microwave 
transmitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``People just flick a switch and expect their power to go on,  
but it's important to ensure that the grid is reliable and 
communications are a piece of that,'' said Tom Williams, spokesman 
for Duke Energy Power Services, which has three plants in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall the drill went smoothly, according to a statement by the  
North American Electric Reliability Council posted on its Web site. 
The New Jersey-based industry group coordinated Friday's test, 
involving some 200 utilities and about 2,000 people. Its spokesman 
failed to return phone calls from The Associated Press seeking 
additional comment. 
</P>
<P>
	There were some incorrect telephone numbers, and some personnel  
lacked training on satellite voice systems, the council's statement 
said. In addition, some radio channels were congested with too many 
people talking at once. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not used to talking over radios any more,'' said Robert  
Green of Public Service Gas &AMP; Electric, New Jersey's largest 
utility. ``People over the years have gotten used to speaking on 
phones, and using radio, using the protocol for radio, is a little 
bit different than using the phone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, severe lightning storms in the Midwest interfered  
with radio transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Electricity customers weren't affected by Friday's drill because  
energy production wasn't tested. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Newark operations room of Public Service Electric and Gas  
Co., system operator Mike Cupo was typical of participants, 
speaking into a red receiver connected to the radio of an operator 
at a substation more than 30 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Branchburg,'' he said, ``Can I have the reading on the 5018,  
please?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The called-in results varied from the real thing because of the  
time it takes a substation operator to walk from the meter to a 
radio, said PSE&AMP;G's Green. 
</P>
<P>
	``This actually goes back to the way it used to be done before  
all the sophisticated computer monitoring equipment was around,'' 
said Mike Tyndall, spokesman for Atlanta-based Southern Company, 
the largest electricity producer in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In another part of the drill, Northern States Power Co. in  
Minneapolis successfully managed a simulated sudden shutdown of a 
regional power generator. The company simulated the steps to make 
up for the energy loss by increasing output from other generating 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The test date, April 9, was chosen because it is the 99th day of  
1999, a number experts feared might read as an error message in 
some computer programs, since some programmers once typed in a 
series of 9s as placeholders. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the handful of utility companies surveyed by The  
Associated Press Friday reported glitches due to the April 9 date. 
</P>
<P>
	Another drill is scheduled for Sept. 9, 1999, the ninth day of  
the ninth month of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug stems from older computer programs' and chips' use  
of only two digits for the year. When 2000 rolls around, some 
programs might think it is 1900, resulting in anything from 
calculation mistakes to outright failures. 
</P>
<P>
	The reliabilty council's job is to help make sure electrical  
utilities are ready for the possibility of a Y2K glitch and spotty 
outages or -- a worst-case scenario -- complete electricity 
shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Consumers) should gain a measure of confidence that the  
loonies out there who are profiting by panic over Y2K may not have 
it quite right,'' said John Castagna, a spokesman for the 
Washington-based Edison Electric Institute, an industry group whose 
members generate about three-quarters of the country's electricity. 
``We're working hard to make Jan. 1, 2000 just like every other 
day.''

<HEADLINE> FAA To Test Y2K Computer Fixes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration hopes Denver's  
airport -- once famous for a computerized baggage system that 
shredded luggage -- will be the scene of a technological triumph 
when the agency tests its Year 2000 computer fixes. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Saturday and early Sunday, the agency plans to split the  
computers controlling air traffic around Denver International 
Airport and spin the clock ahead to Jan. 1, 2000, in half of the 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The radar systems will track commercial flights and an FAA Lear  
Jet flying over Grand Junction, in western Colorado; Denver, on the 
eastern side of the Rocky Mountains; and Colorado Springs, located 
to the south. 
</P>
<P>
	During the four-hour test, technicians will check computer  
software changes designed to solve the Y2K problem. Early computer 
programs used a two-digit format to read dates, and there has been 
widespread concern about problems when the year changes from ``99'' 
to ``00,'' which unrepaired computers may construe as 1900 instead 
of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	For safety's sake, the FAA plane and the small amount of  
commercial traffic expected during the midnight hours will be 
tracked by air traffic control systems not participating in the 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, the computers will be rejoined and tapes from both  
sides will be sent to the agency's technical center in Atlantic 
City, N.J., where similar tests have already been conducted in a 
laboratory. The results will be released next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver airport was chosen for the test because its computers  
can be split and track flights on parallel systems. The airport 
took some ribbing when it opened in 1995 for its $5 billion 
pricetag and an automated baggage system that had a propensity to 
destroy luggage. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an extremely important test to the national airspace  
system,'' said Ray Long, head of the FAA's Y2K program. Long said 
he doesn't anticipate problems, but if they are encountered, 
``That's why you do testing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, more than 600 million people -- and billions of  
dollars worth of goods and mail -- travel through U.S. skies. All do 
so with the aid of the FAA's computerized air traffic control 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of that, many people have sworn off flying over the New  
Year's holiday, including the chief executive officer and other top 
officials at Australia's Qantas Airlines. The carrier has never had 
a fatal crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be at our headquarters stone cold sober watching what  
happens and ready to take quick actions,'' Qantas CEO James Strong 
said Thursday in Adelaide, Australia, in a speech to a national 
meeting of accountants. ``The last place I'd want a key executive 
to be is in the air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While there may be some glitches, the FAA is confident planes  
will not fall out of the sky as 1999 turns to 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The more likely result is that air traffic controllers will  
spread planes apart to enlarge existing safety buffers, reducing 
the system's efficiency and creating flight delays. The timing is 
especially troublesome, since the century will change as Friday 
turns to Saturday on a busy holiday travel weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The live test is an important benchmark and public relations  
challenge for the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the agency in particular and the Transportation Department  
in general have received failing grades from Congress, the General 
Accounting Office and the department's own inspector general over 
Year 2000 preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration had wanted all ``mission critical''  
government computer systems to be repaired, tested and operational 
by March 31, but the FAA missed that deadline. At that time, only 
108 of the 151 FAA mission critical systems had received the 
necessary repairs and tests, for a 72 percent completion rate. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA Administrator Jane Garvey, who will join Long for this  
weekend's test, has declared the agency will complete its work by 
June 30. To demonstrate their confidence in the repairs, Garvey and 
Long plan to fly coast-to-coast on New Year's Eve, hitting the Year 
2000 crossover repeatedly as they travel through the continent's 
four time zones.

<HEADLINE> Baker, Perez de Cuellar on IOC Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Howard Baker and Javier Perez de Cuellar were  
placed on a panel Friday that will police the conduct of 
International Olympic Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Baker, a former Senate majority leader and White  
House chief of staff, and Perez de Cuellar, the United Nations 
secretary-general for 10 years, were among the eight members 
appointed to its Ethics Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel was created last month in the wake of the Salt Lake  
City bribery scandal, in which six IOC members were expelled and 
four resigned for receiving improper inducements during the Utah 
capital's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee has also set up a separate reform panel, IOC 2000,  
to recommend ways of restructuring the organization. Former 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Peter Ueberroth, chief 
organizer of the 1984 Los Angeles Games, are among those already 
appointed to that panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics commission will be chaired by IOC vice president Keba  
Mbaye of Senegal, former vice president of the International Court 
of Justice in the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The other members announced Friday were French Senator Robert  
Badinter, former president of the French Constitution Court; former 
Swiss President Kurt Furgler; former Canadian Olympic athlete 
Charmaine Crooks; and IOC executive board members Kevan Gosper of 
Australia and Chiharu Igaya of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The individuals selected for the ethics commission are known  
for their independence and strong ethics,'' IOC president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch said. ``I am confident that the world of the 
commission will help the IOC adopt global best practice as we enter 
the new millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appointments of Baker and Perez de Cuellar should lend  
weight to the IOC's efforts to repair its credibility following the 
biggest scandal in its 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, 74, a Tennessee Republican, served in the U.S. Senate  
from 1967-85. He served as Senate majority leader and was White 
House chief of staff under President Reagan in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez de Cuellar, 79, was U.N. chief from 1982 to 1991.  
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said the ethics panel will provide ``guidance on how the  
IOC operates in accordance with the best practices of international 
governance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said the panel would develop a framework of ethical  
principles and rules, study the Olympic bidding and selection 
process, ensure accountability and enforce compliance with a new 
code of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, which will meet at least twice a year and report  
to the IOC executive board, will hold its first meeting on May 3 at 
IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the composition of the IOC 2000 reform panel is not  
yet complete. The panel will have 20 to 24 members, half from the 
IOC and half from outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from Kissinger and Ueberroth, others appointed to that  
commission so far include U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill 
Hybl, IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz and Italian industrialist 
Giovanni Agnelli. 
</P>
<P>
	The other panel members are expected to be announced in the next  
few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform committee will consider how IOC members are elected,  
term limits, structure and membership of the executive board, 
further roles for Olympic athletes, revenue sharing and the 
evolution of the games themselves.

<HEADLINE> Touted Amateur Field at the Masters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Hank Kuehne didn't realize the importance of  
the moment until he walked from the practice green to the first tee 
at Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	As he fought his way through the crowd, the U.S. Amateur  
champion heard Masters' officials call out the other players in his 
threesome: defending champion Mark O'Meara and European star Lee 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then it starts to hit you,'' Kuehne said. ``I'm usually a  
pretty relaxed person. I was shocked at how fast and heavy it hit 
me going to the first tee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After hooking his first tee shot onto the edge of the eighth  
fairway, Kuehne calmed himself and put together a respectable first 
round at the Masters on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	So did most of the others in the touted amateur field. Kuehne  
shot a 2-over-par 74, which made him only the fourth-best amateur 
on the day behind Spanish phenom Sergio Garcia (72), South African 
Trevor Immelman (72) and U.S. Amateur runner-up Tom McKnight (73), 
who birdied the final three holes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told us at the amateur dinner the other night that we  
were the best field they've ever had,'' Kuehne said. ``We've got a 
lot of good players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Kuchar, who paved the way a year ago with the best finish  
by an amateur since 1984, struggled to a 77, his flu-ridden body 
unable to cope with the sweltering Georgia heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was a little more of a fairy tale,'' said Kuchar,  
the Georgia Tech junior who finished 21st in the 1998 Masters. 
``This year, I'm under the weather and it's taking away some of the 
fairy tale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia -- ``El Nino'' -- picked up where Kuchar left off, and he  
took Immelman, McKnight and Kuehne along for the ride. All posted 
impressive scores amid the swirling wind and rock-hard greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little nervous at the beginning,'' said Garcia, who  
earned a spot in the tournament by winning the British Amateur. 
``But after three or four holes, I got so relaxed. ... I didn't 
feel nothing. It was like I was in a cloud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immelman, 19, was paired with countryman and three-time Masters  
champion Gary Player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a future champion today,'' said Player, who hugged  
Immelman after the round. ``He's got to be the best player in the 
world for a 19-year-old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Player didn't get a look at Garcia, who was in the  
threesome with Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniard bogeyed the first two holes after errant tee shots.  
He landed in a patch of trees along the left side of the first 
fairway, then hooked his shot at No. 2 into a ditch, forcing him to 
a take a one-shot penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia made the turn at 3-over, but he felt like things were  
about to turn for the better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just keep playing,'' he said under his breath, ``and the  
birdies will come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They did on the next two holes. At 10, he hit a 9-iron to within  
20 feet of the cup and made the putt. At 11, his 8-iron provided an 
easy -- by Augusta standards -- uphill putt from about seven feet. He 
missed a downhill seven-footer for birdie at 13, but made up for it 
four holes later by using his sand wedge from 127 yards to set up a 
10-foot birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuehne, who managed to strike cars on Washington Avenue with his  
booming shots on the practice range, closed with two birdies on the 
final four holes to put himself in position to make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The start of his round didn't go as well. Kuehne hooked his  
first tee shot over the pine trees on the left side of the fairway, 
through the adjacent ninth fairway and into the rough along No. 8. 
But, after some helpful advice from his playing partners, he 
managed to salvage a par. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told me the worst was over, it's all downhill from  
here,'' Kuehne recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old Kuchar felt bursts of energy, like his birdie  
putt from off the green at No. 9 that prompted a high-fiving 
exchange with several members of gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the day, though, he trudged around the course with a  
towel draped around his neck, looking downright wobbly. He even 
stopped along the ropes to grab a sweat-stained cap from his uncle, 
John, making a futile attempt to block out the sun as the 
thermometer climbed to 90 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Immelman won the U.S. Public Links title, which hardly made him  
one of the high-profile players entering the Masters. But he shook 
off an early case of the nerves and thoroughly enjoyed the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may not be heaven,'' Immelman said. ``But you can see it  
from here.''

<HEADLINE> McDougal Deliberations To Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In a bizarre twist that could have  
caused a mistrial, one of the jurors in Susan McDougal's case 
apparently decided to bring a little outside expertise to jury 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	The deliberations had barely begun Friday when U.S. District  
Judge George Howard Jr. suspended them to address concerns over 
juror Michael Nance, who had brought a law book into the jury room. 
Jurors in criminal cases are constantly admonished to stick solely 
to the judge's instructions for guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal is accused of two counts of criminal contempt and  
one count of obstruction for refusing to answer grand jury 
questions about the business dealings of President Clinton and 
Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	She says she refused because she believed Independent Counsel  
Kenneth Starr wanted to ``get'' the Clintons and would charge her 
with perjury if he didn't like her answers. 
</P>
<P>
	A court clerk discovered the book of state and federal court  
rules and brought it to the judge's attention. The book bore the 
signature and business card of former Arkansas Supreme Court 
Justice John I. Purtle, an acquaintance of both Mrs. McDougal and 
the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard ordered an FBI investigation into possible jury  
tampering, then called it off after satisfying himself that the 
strange tale the two men were telling was true: Nance had bought 
his house from Purtle, who had apparently left the law book behind 
when he moved. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire day was taken up sorting out the Purtle-Nance saga.  
The two men said they never contacted each other, handling the 
house sale through a real estate agent. Purtle occasionally bumped 
into Mrs. McDougal in 1996 at her first Whitewater trial but said 
he had nothing to do with her current case. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's prosecutors wanted Nance dismissed and the deliberations  
to continue with 11 jurors. Alternate jurors had already been 
dismissed before deliberations began Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense wanted Howard to keep the full 12-member jury,  
arguing that members hadn't been ``tainted'' by Nance's apparent 
reference to the book. Defense lawyer Mark Geragos, who said he 
suspected the jury had come to a decision on the obstruction 
charge, said he might ask for a mistrial if Nance were removed. 
</P>
<P>
	In an earlier interview, Purtle said he worked with Mrs. Clinton  
on a legal case in the early 1990s before she became first lady. He 
said he has no connection to Mrs. McDougal's trial, but feels 
strongly she shouldn't be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	After Purtle's testimony, Howard questioned Nance privately,  
then announced his decision in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard backed off his plans for an FBI investigation, ruled that  
Nance could remain on the jury and told jurors to return to court 
Monday to resume their deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse, prosecutor Mark Barrett said, ``It was  
kind of a roller-coaster day.'' He agreed with Howard's decision to 
call off the FBI investigation and said his confidence in the jury 
had not been shaken. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos lambasted what he called the prosecution team's  
``institutional paranoia.'' He noted that before Purtle was brought 
in for questioning, Barrett said that Purtle, while he was on the 
state Supreme Court, sided with Mrs. McDougal and her husband in a 
case that involved a branch office for a bank they owned in 
northern Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had spun that tale, they'd be accusing me of having  
electrodes implanted in my brain,'' Geragos said.

<HEADLINE> Gov't: Packer Underpaying Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department charged meat packer  
Excel Corp. with violating federal laws and underpaying hog farmers 
by about $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA officials said they could request that an administrative  
judge fine the company almost $200 million for violating the 
Packers and Stockyards Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive 
practices by packers. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint, brought Friday by USDA's Grain Inspection,  
Packers and Stockyards Administration, alleges that Wichita, 
Kan.-based Excel changed the formula it uses to determine how much 
hog farmers are paid without notifying farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The change allegedly cheated more than 1,250 farmers who did  
business at the company's plants in Beardstown, Ill., Ottumwa, 
Iowa, and Marshall, Mo., by underpaying them for more than 19,900 
hogs in late 1997 and early 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``To remain competitive and to survive, America's small and  
medium-sized producers need a level playing field,'' Agriculture 
Secretary Dan Glickman said. ``Today's action demonstrates how 
seriously we at USDA take our responsibility for ensuring that 
level playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excel, which controls 9 percent of the hog slaughter market, is  
a subsidiary of Minneapolis-based food giant Cargill Inc. Excel 
also owns five beef slaughter operations in Nebraska, Colorado, 
Kansas and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	A company spokesman said they would contest the complaint. They  
have 20 days to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	The action ``is legally without merit and was taken without  
first providing adequate notice of an alleged violation,'' said 
spokesman Mark Klein. ``We're not aware of any other case in which 
(the USDA agency) has filed a complaint against a company for 
improving the accuracy of a technology or process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we would have erred by failing to implement a more  
accurate equation,'' Klein said. The company will pay aggrieved 
producers $1.8 million, Klein said, but it feels additional 
penalties would be unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein said the company offered to pay the disputed $1.8 million  
after the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration 
complained that the growers had not been notified months after the 
October 1997 change. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore said Thursday the administration will  
push for mandatory price reporting among meat processors to ensure 
that farmers have a fair shot in the marketplace. Farmers have long 
complained that big companies push them out by keeping prices 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers have held several hearings this year on how  
concentration in agriculture has affected farmers and the prices 
they receive. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the formula by which hogs are paid, known as  
``carcass merit basis.'' A carcass' merit is determined by the 
amount of lean it produced. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they did was reduce the lean value for most hogs, which  
meant that the farmer was getting less money for his hogs,'' said 
Harold Davis, the complaining agency's deputy administrator for 
packers and stockyards. ``The violation here is that they did not 
tell the farmer that they changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excel counters the new formula was implemented to improve the  
company's pricing system. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company's policy is to use the most accurate measurements  
available,'' Klein said. He said the company contends that some 
producers received slightly lower payments under the change while 
others received higher payments.

<HEADLINE>  Yanks' Zimmer Becomes the Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fifty-one years in baseball has made Don Zimmer  
one of the game's great storytellers. One month as New York Yankees 
interim manager has made him the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you guys said nine words to me in three years  
being a bench coach and I loved every minute of it,'' Zimmer said 
Friday before the Yankees beat the Detroit Tigers 12-3 in their 
home opener. ``This is something I just hope I don't screw up. I 
can't wait for Joe to get back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until Joe Torre returns from prostate cancer surgery, Zimmer's  
first priority will be keeping the best team in baseball on track, 
not being the Yankees' Yoda, imparting wisdom and tales. 
</P>
<P>
	And he has an ample supply of both. That's to be expected from a  
man who played briefly for the team that lost the most games in 
baseball history -- the 1962 New York Mets -- and was bench coach for 
last year's Yankees team that won the most games ever. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Torre is gone, don't expect Zimmer to try to imitate  
his friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did that the first two weeks and that was the end of that,''  
said Zimmer, whose record is now 3-1. ``I have to be myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Cone, who started Friday's home opener, has seen the  
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he is more comfortable,'' Cone said. ``The only way  
you can do that is to win some games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If not for Torre, who asked Zimmer to join him in New York  
before the 1996 season, Zimmer would be back in Florida with his 
wife Jean, spending his time at the movies and the race track. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead he is running the World Series champions, talking  
baseball and enjoying every minute of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who doesn't get a special feeling on opening day,  
especially if you are in a uniform, something is wrong,'' said 
Zimmer, who last managed at Yankee Stadium on July 23, 1982, less 
than one week before he was fired by Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, in fact, was supposed to manage the opener at Yankee  
Stadium that year too, but a snow storm wiped out the entire 
series. He was here for the opener the year before, when his 
Rangers lost to the Yankees 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's different being in pinstripes on this kind of day.  
</P>
<P>
	``Coming off the year we had, to walk out today in front of  
50,000 some odd people who are expecting big things is special,'' 
Zimmer said. ``Hopefully the players will play well enough to get 
back to the World Series. I always said the goal should be to win 
the division, but we know that winning the Eastern Division 
championship is not good enough here. Other places you'd be tickled 
to death with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer doesn't shy away from New York's pressure and even  
challenged owner George Steinbrenner to fire him last week over the 
use of Hideki Irabu, whom The Boss called a ``fat ... toad,'' 
setting off Zimmer's first controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said he would quit before adhering to Steinbrenner's  
wishes and starting Irabu on Wednesday in place of Ramiro Mendoza. 
He held firm, even used Irabu for an inning of relief, and hasn't 
heard a complaint yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think George and I are very tight and we'll be all right. I  
did what The Boss said and pitched Irabu on Wednesday,'' Zimmer 
joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing up to Steinbrenner is easy for Zimmer, who already  
walked away from the game once in 1995. While serving as Don 
Baylor's bench coach in Colorado that year, Zimmer packed up his 
bags and left in the fifth inning of a game, not to return to 
baseball until Torre called him the next winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't like the way things were going so I went to Bob  
Gebhard, the team president, and told him about a week before that 
I was retiring on June 6 in the fifth inning,'' Zimmer said. ``Next 
I told Baylor and I think he thought I was really gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``So that day, I went to the clubhouse in the fifth inning,  
showered, took my fungo and my bag and watched the final two 
innings on television in my living room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer waited until Friday's game finished before leaving, then  
rushed out of the interview room with a big smile. The only way to 
end such a memorable day was with a memorable meal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have dinner with the boss,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A fraction of a second later, Zimmer realized he might have sent  
the wrong message. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' he said, ``not that Boss.''  
</P>
<P>
	It was his victory, but he had to share it with Torre, too.

<HEADLINE> Bibliowicz Takes On New Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jessica Bibliowicz, the daughter of Citigroup  
co-chairman Sanford Weill, has been named president and chief 
executive of National Financial Partners, a new company that is 
snapping up small, independent financial services firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Bibliowicz, 39, known on Wall Street as a savvy manager, will be  
following a strategy much like the one her father used to buy up 
insurance and brokerage firms to create Travelers Group, which 
merged with Citibank last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain pieces of it that are reminiscent, and I am  
a great admirer of my father and I learned a lot,'' she said 
Thursday after her appointment was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Bibliowicz, who left her post as president and chief operating  
officer of the investment firm John A. Levin &AMP; Co., has some 
powerful backing at her new job. The New York investment firm 
Apollo Management has put $125 million into National Financial 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Bibliowicz is teaming up with Robert L. Rosen, chairman of  
National Financial Services and an investment executive who has 
worked extensively with Apollo. 
</P>
<P>
	The duo are scouting for other insurance brokerages, investment  
advisory firms, financial planning companies and employee benefit 
firms with average revenues of $3 million to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, National Financial Services has spent a total of $87  
million to acquire 28 firms with combined assets of $1 billion 
under management and earnings of $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Historically, insurance, investment and benefit firms have  
been highly fragmented with respect to their distribution, severely 
limiting their ability to achieve their full potential,'' Rosen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based National Financial Services plans to spend  
another $25 million to buy 15 to 20 more financial services firms 
by June. Within five years, National Financial Services could have 
300 financial services firms under its wings. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to sell stock to the public in three to five  
years when it is large enough and profitable enough to attract 
large mutual and pension fund investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't go public just to go public,'' Bibliowicz said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Must Pay $909M to Thrift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge ordered the federal government today  
to pay $909 million to a California savings and loan, the first of 
what may be numerous damage awards over a 1989 accounting rule 
change that plunged many thrifts into financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Judge Loren Smith of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims told  
the government to pay Glendale Federal Bank for breach of contract. 
Glendale had hoped for an award of $1 billion to $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling stems from a 1996 Supreme Court decision that said  
the government broke its contract with Glendale and two other 
thrifts when it changed the rules on how they must count their 
assets. The justices said the government could be forced to pay 
damages to the S&AMP;Ls for their financial harm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Restitution provides a remedy, and a fair one,'' Smith's  
decision said. ``The government received a very significant benefit 
in 1981'' when Glendale agreed to take over an ailing Florida S&AMP;L. 
The government ``then failed to honor its promise to Glendale upon 
which the contract was premised,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one should be surprised that this decision affirms that the  
government must honor the contracts it makes,'' Glendale's lawyer, 
Ronald Stevens, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said, ``We remain confident in our  
position and look forward to a fair and expeditious final 
resolution'' of the S&AMP;L cases. Privately, Justice lawyers said they 
were pleased the judge did not award the full $2 billion Glendale 
had sought. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar damage claims have been filed against the government by  
about 125 other thrifts, many of which were declared insolvent 
after the 1989 rule change. Some of them have reached financial 
settlements with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Glendale case was the first to reach a judge's decision  
on how much the government must pay, and it was being closely 
watched for the standards it might set for assessing the other 
thrifts' claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's opinion said he ``strongly believes that settlements,  
where fair compromise occurs, are in everyone's interest. The court 
calls upon all parties involved in pending cases to consider what 
alternatives, short of continuing litigation over the coming years, 
may resolve these cases fairly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith issued his decision in late afternoon, after the stock  
markets closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1989 accounting rule change was part of the government's  
effort to rescue the then-troubled thrift industry -- a cleanup that 
overall has cost about $200 billion. The federal law that brought 
about the change tightened rules and provided money to close 
insolvent S&AMP;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, the government had encouraged healthy thrifts to  
take over insolvent ones by letting them count the insolvent S&AMP;L's 
losses as ``goodwill'' assets. The rule change said S&AMP;Ls no longer 
could count such assets toward their minimum capital requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule forced many previously healthy S&AMP;Ls into the red.  
Among them was Glendale, which had taken over a troubled thrift and 
counted $734 million as goodwill assets. After the rule change, 
Glendale had to raise about $450 million to meet its capital 
minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	The government insisted to the Supreme Court that it never  
promised the S&AMP;Ls they would be protected from rule changes. But 
the justices decided otherwise in a 7-2 ruling that exposed the 
government to the possibility of paying billions of dollars in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would, indeed, have been madness'' for the S&AMP;Ls to agree to  
take over ailing thrifts without a binding promise that they could 
rely on the accounting rules then in effect, Justice David H. 
Souter wrote for the nation's highest court in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Glendale's case then returned to Smith to set the amount of  
damages the government must pay. The S&AMP;L's lawyers sought to boost 
the award by arguing Glendale was entitled to recover all the 
profits it would have made if the rules had not changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Glendale's calculation of lost profits was ``too  
remote and speculative.'' Instead, he calculated the damages as 
restitution and to compensate the S&AMP;L for damage caused when it 
fell below the capital minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	Glendale has since merged with California Federal Bank, which is  
owned by Golden State Bancorp of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Glendale's representatives say other industries -- including  
electric utilities and low-income housing developers -- may be able 
to use the 1996 Supreme Court ruling to argue that the federal 
government broke promises to them and should be forced to pay 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The case acted on Friday is Glendale Federal Bank vs. U.S.,  
90-772C.

<HEADLINE> GOP Hopefuls Look TO Fill Void </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Steve Forbes and Tommy Thompson know  
they can't be president in 2001 unless the early Republican 
front-runners falter. Forbes says he will ``smoke 'em out.'' 
Thompson hopes to wait them out. 
</P>
<P>
	Their strategies were on display Friday at a gathering of  
Republican state party chairmen. Although many of the local leaders 
are lining up behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Forbes and Thompson 
courted the chairmen in hopes that Bush will crumble and they can 
fill the vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, the Wisconsin governor who has championed welfare and  
education reforms, said he retains a ``fleeting hope'' of running 
for president. Forbes, a multimillionaire conservative, is the more 
serious candidate; he announced his campaign in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although most of (the chairmen) seem to be going in a  
particular direction, if I don't make the case, nothing can 
happen,'' Forbes told The Associated Press. ``I want them to see 
that I have a message and will go to every possible source to get 
support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has campaigned nonstop since his failed 1996 presidential  
bid, yet public opinion polls show him far behind Bush and 
Elizabeth Dole, former president of the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	He has spent millions of dollars, much of it his own, to promote  
a relatively detailed agenda on abortion, tax reform, foreign 
policy and the economy. Bush and Mrs. Dole, meanwhile, dutifully 
avoid taking stands on national issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately frustrated by that contrast, Forbes met with at least  
a dozen state chairmen to argue that it will take a candidate with 
``principle and substance'' to win the White House in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Do Bush and Dole have those qualities?  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see,'' Forbes said, grinning. ``We haven't seen whether  
they have yet. We'll smoke 'em out. We haven't yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the media and voters in early primary states eventually  
will test the mettle of the early front-runners. If Bush 
disappoints party regulars, Forbes wants to be their second choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may be leaning toward Bush, but I'm telling them, `If  
you're taking a second look, I would appreciate you looking at this 
campaign,''' Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	In four to six weeks, Forbes plans to launch a major television  
advertising campaign in crucial presidential states, officials 
involved in the effort said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander is in a position similar  
to Forbes' and Thompson's. He recently lost a top aide to Bush, 
trails badly in the polls and is not raising nearly as much money 
as the Texas governor. Trying to jump-start his campaign, Alexander 
recently moved his political operations from Tennessee to New 
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander did not attend the chairmen's meeting, which ends  
Saturday. He sent senior adviser Tom Rath to work the hallways. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's campaign had little or no presence here, but Bush  
supporters were out in force. 
</P>
<P>
	While Forbes and the Alexander aide toiled behind the scenes,  
Thompson delivered a fiery luncheon address. He accused Washington 
Republicans of capitulating too often to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``They lost their way,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Thompson also challenged the GOP Congress to pass tax cuts,  
Social Security reform and Medicare changes even if Clinton 
threatens vetoes. The crowd gave him a standing ovation, and 
several party regulars requested copies of the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Talking to reporters before and after the address, Thompson  
conceded that his White House dreams are fading as Bush's political 
strength grows. Yet h wouldn't rule out running, because he thinks 
there's still time for Bush to lose his luster. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time is on my side,'' he said. ``If George Bush keeps going  
the way he's going, more power to him, and he'll (win the 
nomination). But if the wheels fall off the wagon, and I don't 
expect that to happen, then people will be looking for someone 
else.''

<HEADLINE> Jamaica Sells Hotel to Sandals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- The Jamaican government is selling the  
Sandals Ocho Rios hotel it had taken over when it bought the assets 
of a failing insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	The 237-room hotel will be purchased for $14 million by Gordon  
``Butch'' Stewart, owner of the Sandals chain, which has managed 
the Ocho Rios resort for the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandals will spend $8 million to refurbish the hotel, Stewart  
said Thursday. Stewart's company operates eight hotels in Jamaica 
under the Sandals and Beaches names and he said the company is 
``prepared to buy more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ocho Rios resort was controlled by one of several financial  
companies taken over by the Financial Sector Adjustment Co., an 
agency set up by the government to rescue failing banks, insurance 
companies and other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	FINSAC, as the agency is known, still controls nine other hotels  
among the assets it hopes to sell off.

<HEADLINE> Duval Brought Back Down to Earth  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Not even the No. 1 player in the world is  
immune from disaster in the Masters with a single lapse in 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	What David Duval called ``a bad decision'' cost him his first  
triple bogey since August, seriously endangering chances of winning 
his third consecutive tournament and his long-awaited first major. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval had a difficult time talking about his ``snowman'' Friday  
on the 500-yard, par-5 No. 15, which has become a back-nine monster 
since Augusta National officials shaved mounds, planted trees, and 
made the green rock-hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a bad shot at the wrong time,'' Duval admitted. ``It  
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Somehow golf's hottest player hit a high-handicapper wedge after  
deciding to play it safe and lay up with his second shot instead of 
going for the green in two. 
</P>
<P>
	The wedge was shockingly short and the ball found the pond.  
Stunned, Duval dropped another ball. His fifth shot hit the green 
and bounced over, almost going into the water in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	He chipped to the green and two-putted for 8 and first triple  
bogey since the first round of the PGA Championship at Sahalee. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval wouldn't call what happened the result of a bad swing.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a bad decision,'' he said. ``I wanted to carry the  
ball farther than I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval managed to rally with a 6-foot birdie putt on the final  
hole to shoot a 2-over-par 74 that left him well off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	After the round, Duval, who shot a spectacular 59 in the final  
round to win the Bob Hope Classic, tipped his hat to the course. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what so great about this place. It can make you look  
foolish,'' Duval said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he showed the fire that has made him a feared competitor.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm discouraged but I'm not down.'' Duval said. ``It's only  
been two days and that's the good thing. Six shots isn't much to 
make up around this place. So many things can happen. I could make 
a birdie on No. 15 tomorrow and have a four-shot swing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval said his birdie on the last hole saved the day.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a nice way to leave,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was going to the practice range to hit a few wedges,  
he smiled weakly: ``I'm going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was asked if the stress of winning The Players  
Championships and BellSouth Classic in the last two weeks had 
caused him to hit a wall both mentally and physically. 
</P>
<P>
	He shrugged and said, ``Not at all. I'm OK. I just made one bad  
shot on a very tough hole. This doesn't bother me at all. This is 
all part of winning a major. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval came close to winning the Masters last year. It took a  
birdie-birdie finish by Mark O'Meara to beat him and Fred Couples 
by one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	As he turned to walk away, Duval said, ``Augusta National always  
gives you challenges. I'll have another chance and another 
challenge tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> Bill Targets Livestock Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With hog farmers trying to recover from some  
of the lowest prices in years, the Clinton administration is 
proposing that meatpackers be required to reveal what they pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's proposal is slightly different from several  
already pending in Congress. It would make mandatory price 
reporting permanent while many congressional versions authorize a 
three-year pilot program. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration for several years has supported mandatory  
price reporting but has never put forth its own proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our legislation gives USDA authority to work with producers to  
make sure that we get them the most valuable information, so 
they'll have a fuller, more timely picture of what's happening in 
the market place,'' Vice President Al Gore said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore made the announcement during a swing through Iowa -- a  
critical political primary state that is also the nation's largest 
hog state. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have pushed for mandatory price reporting for some time,  
but with greater urgency over the past year. They say there is a 
big gap between what the meatpackers pay them and what consumers 
pay at the checkout counter. 
</P>
<P>
	All areas of livestock are experiencing low prices, and farmers  
have accused big companies of pushing them out by keeping prices 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogs were selling for about 25 cents a pound last month, up from  
a low at the end of 1998 of 8 cents but well below the break-even 
point for most hog farmers of almost 40 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal being sent to Congress, the Agriculture  
Department would require individuals who buy, sell or market 
livestock, livestock products or meat products to report the prices 
of their transactions to USDA. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA now collects the information only on a voluntary basis.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our producers have a right to know how much their product is  
worth on the open market and right now, they don't,'' said Rep. 
John Thune, R-S.D., a sponsor of one of the House versions. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Tank, chief executive officer of the National Pork Producers  
Council, said, ``Knowledge is power. Mandatory price reporting is a 
component of that knowledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the announcement, Chuck Hassebrook, a Nebraska member of  
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman's National Commission on Small 
Farms, said the administration could do more. Commission members in 
February criticized Glickman for not moving to implement some form 
of price reporting, saying he already has some authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as the administration refuses to use its existing  
authority to enforce the law, asking the Congress to pass 
additional legislation is just passing the buck,'' Hassebrook said. 
``It's fine, but it's not exactly providing leadership to send up 
legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a speech two months ago to the National Cattlemen's Beef  
Association, Glickman said his agency had ``broad discretionary 
authority to collect more information from packers'' and vowed to 
introduce interim steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within the next couple of weeks, I will have an announcement  
on specific steps we will take to collect additional price 
information,'' Glickman said then. ``I want to push our course of 
action as far as we can until Congress gives me more authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has never announced those initial steps,  
although a spokesman said Thursday the secretary was still 
reviewing options.

<HEADLINE> Jockey Julie Krone Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The aches and pains from 18 years of riding  
racehorses finally told jockey Julie Krone to call it a career. 
</P>
<P>
	Clambering aboard more than 20,000 horses gave Krone 3,500  
winners, more than $80 million in purses earned and the distinction 
of being the only woman rider to win a Triple Crown race -- the 1993 
Belmont Stakes aboard Colonial Affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked on Thursday about her legacy to the sport, which she  
considers in her blood and in her often-aching bones, Krone 
replied: 
</P>
<P>
	``When some little girl comes up to me beaming and she goes, `I  
play soccer with the boys, and I'm the best scorer and you're my 
hero and I read about you,' those are the times I feel I made a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I made a little girl more brave than she might have been  
and perhaps put a spark under someone who was having a bad day, 
those can be the best moments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krone had plenty of good and bad moments during her career,  
which began with her first winner on Feb. 12, 1981 at Tampa Bay 
Downs and will officially end after her final ride on April 18 at 
Lone Star Park in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a life decision,'' said Krone, thoroughbred racing's  
most successful female rider. ``There's no chance of me riding 
again after April 18.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not even her recent effort at the Fair Grounds in Louisiana,  
where she finished third in the jockey standings with 84 wins, 
including two five-win days, could persuade her otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a constellation of reasons for me to retire,'' Krone  
said during a news conference at Aqueduct Racetrack. ``I'm on top, 
I'm 35 years old, I don't want to get hurt anymore, and I've got 
nothing left to prove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 4-foot-10 1/2, 100 pounds, Krone not only experienced fame and  
fortune, she also gave hope to other females trying to excel in 
sports previously dominated by men. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been an inspiration for not only me, but for every girl  
that came along,'' jockey Diane Nelson said. ``I can remember a 
change happening, when you had big outfits, and the nice horses, 
and people would take a chance on a girl. It wasn't an oddity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krone, married since 1995 to Matt Muzikar, said there are no  
definite plans for the future, adding she has ``many options.'' 
Among those are working in television -- ``I'd love to be able to 
work in TV during Derby week'' -- dabbling in art and photography 
and continuing her education toward a psychology degree. 
</P>
<P>
	She may have ridden well at the Fair Grounds, but the injuries  
proved too much to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like this Olympic runner I read about (who set three  
world records the summer she decided to quit),'' Krone said. ``I'd 
go to sleep at night, and my ankle hurt and my knee hurt and I'd 
think, `I just want to get this over with.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Krone began her run of success in 1987, five years after winning  
her first riding title at Atlantic City. She became the first 
female to win riding titles at major tracks such as Monmouth Park 
and the Meadowlands in New Jersey. In 1989, she was the nation's 
third-leading rider with 368 winners. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1991, she was a regular on the New York circuit and a year  
later won a career-best $9.1 million in purses. In '92 and '93, 
Krone won riding titles at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 20, 1993, she became the third jockey to win five races  
in a day at Saratoga. Angel Cordero Jr. and Ron Turcotte were the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	But 10 days later, Krone went down in a spill and severely  
fractured her right ankle, which required two plates and 14 screws 
to reconstruct. Nine months later, she was riding again. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 13, 1995, she was thrown from her horse again, this time  
at Gulfstream. Krone broke both hands, but never regained her top 
form until recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, Krone broke her right knee at the Meadowlands.  
She won the race, then added two more winners before the fracture 
was diagnosed a day later. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone was back racing three months later, and on Feb. 16 she  
posted her 3,500th victory, guiding May B A Walk to a win at the 
Fair Grounds. She celebrated with a backward handspring. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a student of the game and a student of horses,'' Hall  
of Fame trainer Allen Jerkens said. ``She was interested in the 
training part, too. She worked hard in the mornings and she worked 
hard in the afternoon. ... For her to win 3,500 is remarkable.''

<HEADLINE> Cops To Make Policy on Traffic Stop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police chiefs from some of the nation's  
largest cities said today they would develop a national policy 
governing traffic stops in an effort to alleviate concerns about 
police targeting minority drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	The chiefs were accompanied by minority activists as they made  
the announcement. It came after a closed-door conference on 
Thursday coordinated by the Police Executive Research Forum on how 
to improve police relations with the community. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday she wants to confront  
the issue of police using racial profiles to stop citizens but says 
she needs more data on how often and where such practices are in 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure to address minority complaints about police  
treatment, Reno told her weekly news conference: 
</P>
<P>
	``It is so very important that we address the feelings of  
Americans who feel that police officers are stopping them because 
of race. Let's address it, let's hit it head-on. If police officers 
say, `We're not (using racial profiles),' let's stand behind them, 
but stand behind them with hard facts. And where we see the 
problem, let's do something about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She labeled racial profiling as a basis for traffic stops and  
other police questioning of citizens ``one of the more difficult 
issues that we have to confront.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the U.S. Customs Service, faced with a growing  
chorus of complaints about alleged racial profiling, on Thursday 
created an independent panel to review the policies and procedures 
used by inspectors looking for airline passengers who might be 
smuggling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno called for police departments to collect more hard data to  
see whether and where racial profiles might be in use. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hear all the anecdotes, and what we're trying to do is to  
develop the hard information that can show police agencies what 
needs to be done in fact, and that can dispel (mistrust) ... where 
there is no racial profiling involved,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	She hailed a program recently instituted by San Diego police  
that requires traffic officers to record the race of people they 
stop. They can do this quickly and unobtrusively on handheld 
computers the officers carry, Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not compiling specific case information, they're  
compiling numbers to see if there is an unwarranted skewing that 
would indicate an inappropriate reliance on a racial profile,'' 
Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	But she declined to criticize police departments which have  
resisted gathering such data. ``Other departments may not have that 
automation and there may be good reason for not implementing it 
immediately,'' she explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The police chiefs this morning stopped short of saying they  
would implement a program like San Diego's, saying it needed more 
discussion. But they said a national policy would likely entail 
having the officer tell the driver why they had been stopped and 
issue an apology if no violation was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno plans a major speech on police integrity here next week.  
Last month, a group of civil rights leaders asked her to visit the 
New York City site of a recent police shooting of an unarmed 
immigrant and speak out against police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
	The Feb. 4 killing of Amadou Diallo, who was shot at 41 times  
and hit 19 times, has sparked a series of protests in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno also met privately Thursday with New York City Police  
Commissioner Howard Safir and police chiefs and community leaders 
from 19 cities on the issue of police-community relations. The 
chiefs and community leaders gathered here by the Police Executive 
Research Forum, a group of big-city police executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department is investigating allegations of racial  
profiling by the New Jersey State Police in traffic stops and by 
police agencies in Eastpointe, Mich., and Orange County, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., is planning to reintroduce a bill  
requiring the Justice Department to collect data on traffic stops 
by local police. The department supported last year's version. Reno 
said Thursday it is important to pursue legislation but said she is 
concerned that adequate resources be made available to collect such 
data in a useful and fair way.

<HEADLINE> 31 Acts Announced for Woodstock '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Limp Bizkit? Korn? Rage Against the Machine?  
It's not your father's Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
	That's precisely the point. Woodstock '99 promoters announced a  
31-act lineup Thursday geared to teens and 20-year-olds that, so 
far at least, doesn't include one performer from the namesake 
festival in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dave Matthews Band, Jewel, Metallica and Alanis Morissette  
are this year's headliners for the three-day show, scheduled for 
July 23-25. It will be held at Griffiss Park, an abandoned Air 
Force base in Rome, N.Y., about 50 miles west of Albany. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers expect a crowd of about 250,000 people for the show,  
which also features Fatboy Slim, Sugar Ray, Creed, Counting Crows, 
Rusted Root, the Offspring, the Brian Setzer Orchestra, George 
Clinton and Willie Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	Six acts that played the 25-year anniversary concert, which drew  
an estimated 350,000 people to Saugerties, N.Y., are coming back: 
Metallica, Aerosmith, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sheryl Crow, Live and 
Collective Soul. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three more days of mud, noise and logistical nightmares?''  
said Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich. ``Wouldn't miss it for the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although DMX and Ice Cube are included, the lineup is short on  
rap acts. Promoters say they expect to add six to 10 more acts. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers promise better security than at the first two  
Woodstocks, which were overrun by gatecrashers. Instead of the 
flimsy 6-foot chainlink fence that surrounded the Woodstock '94 
site, Griffiss will be ringed by a 12-foot plywood fence backed 
with steel girders. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticket packages including bus transportation will go on sale  
April 18, with prices starting at $249.99.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against most major currencies  
Friday after see-sawing through the day as traders reassessed the 
significance of the European Central Bank's big interest rate cut 
the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0790, up  
from $1.0740 late Thursday. The dollar was worth 120.98 Japanese 
yen, down from 121.37 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Central Bank, representing the 11 countries using  
the new euro currency, lowered a key interest rate Thursday in the 
hopes of jump-starting Europe's sluggish economies and reducing its 
double-digit unemployment. Lower rates promote lending and 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro and other European currencies initially jumped after  
the rate cut amid renewed faith in the European economies, but 
quickly retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders had been expecting a modest rate cut and the one-half  
percentage point cut was deemed too much because investors may 
decide they can find better returns elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, markets began reassessing that stance.  
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4829 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4878, and 1.4999 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4997. The British 
pound was quoted at $1.6103, up from $1.6049. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8112 
German marks, down from 1.8212; 6.0793 French francs, down from 
6.1087; and 1,794.50 Italian lire, down from 1,801.80.

	Internet Stocks Lead the Way

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet stocks led the way today. Online  
auction company eBay rose 11 1/2 at 183 1/4 in Nasdaq trading. Also on 
the Nasdaq, theglobe.com soared 19 3/8 to 76 3/8. The Internet service 
provider announced a 2-for-1 stock split late yesterday. Investors

4 1/4 to 71 9/16 and UAL Corp. rose 1 7/8 to 78 15/16. Sending the Dow 
lower was Union Carbide, off 3 5/16 to 48 1/16, after Morgan 
Stanley cut its rating of the chemical company. Analysts have 
dismissed takeover rumors involving the company. Another Dow 
component, General Motors, was down 2 1/4 at 85 5/8.

	Continental Hikes Air Fares  
</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Continental Airlines raised its leisure fares 3  
percent and its walkup fares 1 percent today, signaling the 
industry's third increase this year if competitors follow suit. 
After price stability throughout 1998, the major airlines increased 
fares in January and then again just four weeks ago. Those two 
hikes saw leisure fares rise 7 percent this year and business fares 
3 percent. Analysts cite a thriving economy that has boosted demand 
and rising fuel costs that are making flights more expensive for 
airlines.

	American, Attendants Agree on Reno

<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines and its flight  
attendants' union have reached an agreement on how the airline will 
absorb Reno Air flight attendants. AMR, the airline's parent 
company, and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants did 
not disclose details of the plan, agreed on late last night. The 
pact covers issues such as seniority and pay for American and Reno 
flight attendants. The flight attendants union and American still 
are negotiating a new contract. American and its pilots' union are 
still at odds over the acquisition of Reno. Their disagreement led 
to a massive sickout in February that caused the cancellation of 
nearly 6,700 flights.

coffee-makers in a trade war involving bananas. The final list 
excluded a number of products that had been on the original target

	Murdoch Blocked in Soccer Team Bid  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Rupert Murdoch was blocked by the British  
government today in his $1 billion bid to buy Manchester United, a 
price that would have been the highest for any team in the world. 
The government contended the purchase by Murdoch's BSkyb media 
company would have hurt competition in the broadcast industry and 
the quality of British soccer. Murdoch's bid was made in October 
and accepted by the club's board. But it was referred to the 
Monopolies and Mergers Commission amid opposition from lawmakers 
and Manchester United fans. BSkyB has exclusive rights to cover 
Premier League games live, and today's decision is a major blow to 
Murdoch's attempt to become an even bigger influence in the sport.

	Subaru Recalls Foresters, Legacys

<P>
	CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- Subaru of America Inc. is recalling  
approximately 221,000 of its 1998-99 Forester and Legacy vehicles -- 
including Outback models -- due to a potential brake malfunction in 
extremely cold weather. The company said no accidents or injuries 
had been reported as a result of the problem. Subaru said an 
internal valve in the brake master cylinder can momentarily be 
stuck in the open position during normal braking at temperatures of 
minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit and below. If that happens, the vehicle 
slows but does not stop right away, officials said. The problem can 
be corrected by releasing the brake pedal and stepping on it 
sharply one time, the company said.

	GM Considers Building New Plant

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. has taken major steps toward  
building its first new U.S. assembly plant in a decade. But the 
world's largest automaker says the plan is far from a done deal, 
given hurdles that include potentially contentious talks with the 
United Auto Workers. As part of the preliminary legal work, GM has 
applied for an air-quality permit from the state and has begun 
clearing land next to its plant in Lansing, a spokesman said today. 
The company also must reach agreement with the UAW on work rules 
and employment levels, get approval from the state and GM's board, 
and pin down such issues as tax breaks.

</P>
<P>
	The acquisition includes Cascade's solid tire manufacturing

</P>
<P>
	Maine Tire now has 175 workers and annual sales of about $27  
million. After taking ownership of the Cascade properties, sales 
will grow to about $70 million a year. Its work force will increase 
to about 440 people, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine Tire is a unit of Maine Rubber International, a  
50-year-old company with headquarters in Westbrook, Maine, and 
plants in Westbrook and Scarborough, also in Maine. The company 
also has six distribution centers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	No layoffs or cutbacks are expected from the acquisition, but  
there may be some reassignments. The sale is expected to be 
completed later this month.

<HEADLINE> Producer Prices Rise 0.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices charged by factories and other  
producers remained tame in March, but the biggest increase in crude 
oil costs since the Gulf War signaled a temporary burst of 
inflation in the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department's Producer Price Index for finished goods  
rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent, bringing the annualized 
rate of increase for the first three months of 1999 to 1.5 percent, 
the Labor Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The unexpectedly mild report reassured Wall Street that any  
interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve is still months 
away. The Dow Jones average of industrial stocks held near 
Thursday's record close, slipping only 24 points to 10,174. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inflation remains dead,'' said economist Stan Shipley of  
Merrill Lynch. ``It will ... help keep the Fed on hold despite 
strong economic growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, prices of finished energy goods jumped sharply in  
March, by 1.2 percent, with gasoline rising 3.5 percent, heating 
oil soaring 13.1 percent -- the most in five years, residential 
electricity edging 0.2 percent higher and natural gas falling 1.8 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans face even sharper energy increases in the months  
ahead, especially if last month's pact among members of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries holds up. Crude 
petroleum jumped 27.1 percent in March, the biggest increase since 
October 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first impact of the agreement by oil producers to limit  
production is apparent,'' said economist Donald Ratajczak of 
Georgia State University. ``Further gains are likely next month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question is whether higher energy costs will work their way  
through the price chain, resulting in any significant acceleration 
in overall consumer price inflation, which last year sank to a 
12-year low of 1.6 percent. So far the judgment of most analysts is 
``no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While inflation can pick up -- and it may pick up to 2.5  
percent -- the days of 4-, 5-, 6-percent inflation look to be long 
gone,'' said economic consultant Joel Naroff of Holland, Pa. ``It's 
going to take a lot more than just oil prices to create real 
inflation problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the volatile food and energy components, prices were  
unchanged in March for the second consecutive month. That reflects 
pressure on domestic producers to compete with cheaply priced 
imports. Auto prices, for instance, fell 0.5 percent in March and 
household appliances, 1.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American economy has found a vaccination for the inflation  
bug in the form of higher productivity and international 
competition,'' said economist David Huether of the National 
Association of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Food costs paid by wholesalers rose a moderate 0.4 percent last  
month. Fruit prices fell 5.5 percent, reflecting an 18.5 percent 
drop for navel oranges and 5.9 percent for golden delicious apples. 
</P>
<P>
	However, vegetable prices soared 20.2 percent, the most in eight  
months, reflecting increases of 115.5 percent for eggplant, 67.9 
percent for corn, 67.1 percent for lettuce and 45.4 percent for 
tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fish prices jumped 9.4 percent, the largest rise in nearly 13  
years. Pork and beef rose, too. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, at earlier stages of the production process, prices  
rose 0.3 percent for intermediate goods and 1 percent for crude 
goods. An example of the three stages is bread for finished, flour 
for intermediate and wheat for crude.

	LONDON (AP) -- Rupert Murdoch was blocked by the British

</P>
<P>
	The government contended the purchase by Murdoch's BSkyb media

</P>
<P>
	Murdoch's bid was made in October and accepted by the club's

</P>
<P>
	BSkyB has exclusive rights to cover Premier League games live,  
and today's decision is a major blow to Murdoch's attempt to become 
an even bigger influence in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a tremendous victory for supporters of Manchester United  
and for all football club fans,'' said Andy Walsh, chairman of the 
Manchester United Independent Supporters Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``The news is fantastic and follows seven months of hard work.  
This is great for us and for anyone fighting for the independence 
of their club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murdoch bought the Los Angeles Dodgers last year and has a 40  
percent stake in Madison Square Garden, the New York Knicks and New 
York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	The rejection by the government came two days after Howard  
Milstein withdrew his $800 million bid to buy the Washington 
Redskins. The proposed sale of the NFL team would have been a 
record for a U.S. sports franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers announced this latest  
move, saying the MMC's findings are ``based mainly on competition 
grounds where they concluded that the merger would adversely affect 
competition between broadcasters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But they also examined wider public interest issues concluding  
that the merger would damage the quality of British football,'' 
Byers said. ``I accept these findings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BSkyB chief executive Mark Booth said he was still convinced the  
takeover was in the best interests of fans and good for soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ruling sets an unfortunate precedent for other British  
clubs and companies who may have wanted to work together to improve 
and invest in the future of football, for the benefit of clubs, 
players and fans alike,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Byers said the MMC report concluded the takeover would have  
reduced competition for the broadcasting rights to Premier League 
games and damaged the soccer as well. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the sale would have reenforced the ``trend towards  
growing inequalities between the larger richer clubs and the 
smaller, poorer ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it would give BSkyB ``additional influence over Premier  
League decisions about the organization of football leading to some 
decisions, which would not reflect the game's long-term 
interests.''

<HEADLINE> McCarron Not Surprised by Success  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- It came as a shock to some fans at Augusta  
National on Friday that 5-foot-10, 170-pound Scott McCarron could 
drive the ball over 300 yards, farther than playing partners Fred 
Couples and Steve Elkington. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't surprise the cocky McCarron, who not only outhit the  
more celebrated players in his threesome, but outscored them for 
the second consecutive day. McCarron's 4-under-par 68 put him at 
seven under, one shot behind leader Jose Maria Olazabal after 36 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
	On a star-studded Masters scoreboard, McCarron was one of the  
lesser lights, although he won the 1996 Freeport McDermott Classic 
and the 1997 BellSouth Classic. He feels he belongs with the big 
boys of the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I'm playing with Greg Norman or Couples I feel I'm as  
good as them,'' he said. ``You have to believe that or you don't 
belong out here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that McCarron hasn't proved he can play.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've finished 10th and 16th at the Masters, and I've finished  
10th at the U.S. Open,'' the 33-year-old said. ``The media portrays 
Justin Leonard, Tiger Woods and David Duval as the young guns. But 
there are still guys like myself, Tim Herron and Paul Stankowski 
who are doing pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarron, who uses the long putter, capped off his round with a  
15-foot downhill birdie putt on the slick 18th green. It was his 
sixth birdie against two bogeys. He has the length to reach Augusta 
National's par-5s and birdied two of them on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you birdie the last hole it always makes supper taste  
better,'' he said. ``I hit a lot of great shots out there today. I 
made bogeys but I didn't have any really bad shots. That's just the 
way it is. Augusta National is going to get you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarron, of Rancho Murieta, Calif., played on UCLA's 1988  
national championship team. He quit playing after leaving college 
and went into his father's clothing business. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't start playing again until 1992. He got on the PGA Tour  
in 1995 after finishing 31st in qualifying school. 
</P>
<P>
	``After two days I feel great because I'm just one shot behind  
Jose and I've got two days left,'' he said. ``They always say the 
Masters starts on the back nine on Sunday so we've got a lot of 
golf to play. But you better play good on Thursday and Friday to 
get to that back nine on Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarron did.

<HEADLINE> Court Blocks Gov't Safety Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court blocked enforcement of  
a government program aimed at improving safety at some 12,500 
relatively dangerous workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration  
illegally instituted its cooperative-compliance program in 1997, a 
three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia ruled on Friday by a 2-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The program had been challenged by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  
National Association of Manufacturers, American Trucking 
Associations and Food Marketing Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	OSHA failed to provide adequate notice and enough time for  
public comment before instituting the program, in violation of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, the court ruled. It therefore set 
aside the program ``without prejudice to the ability of the agency 
to repromulgate it after observing the required procedures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamber of Commerce lawyer Stephen Bokat praised Friday's  
decision, and said the agency's failure to follow the required 
procedures ``demonstrates OSHA's paternalistic attitude that they 
know better than business and have nothing to learn from 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials had argued that notice and comment were not  
necessary because the program amounted to a procedural rule, not a 
substantive one. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, OSHA officials notified thousands of  
employers in selected industries and gave them a chance to cut down 
the odds that their workplaces would be inspected for safety 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Workplaces were removed from the agency's primary-inspection  
list -- reducing by 70 percent to 90 percent the chance they would 
be inspected -- if employers agreed to meet a health and safety 
standard more stringent than federal law requires. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit challenging the program also contended that the  
envisioned inspections violated employers' constitutional 
protections against unreasonable searches, but the court did not 
reach that Fourth Amendment issue.

<HEADLINE> Doc Calls Lindros Surgery a Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros was breathing easier following  
surgery today to remove a blood clot from his chest cavity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Flyers' star center underwent the 90-minute  
procedure after a setback in his recovery from a collapsed lung. 
Doctors at the University of Pennsylvania called the procedure a 
success and said Lindros should make a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in some pain right now but he's feeling pretty good,''  
said Dr. Larry Kaiser, a chest surgeon who performed the operation. 
``He's glad it's over and looks forward to being out of here in a 
few days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A whirlwind day that began with Lindros being released from a  
hospital in Nashville, Tenn., turned somber when Kaiser said 
Thursday night that the prolific scorer and team captain had run a 
fever in excess of 102 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser removed a hardened blood clot that was pressing against  
the lower lobe of Lindros' right lung, keeping it from fully 
expanding. The fluid in the lung was not infected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found exactly what we thought we would find,'' Kaiser said.  
``We were able to totally remove it and his lung is now completely 
re-expanded ... I think he'll find his breathing is significantly 
better, easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure, called video thoroscopy, was minor, and Lindros  
is expected to be hospitalized four to five days at Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers, who beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 3-1 Thursday night  
as Lindros was readmitted to the hospital, are preparing for a 
playoff run without him. For now, it's almost impossible to stop 
thinking about the heart and soul of their team. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the sportscast this morning, we were all basically  
listening to his every word because nobody's talked to him,'' said 
goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck, who stopped 16 shots including three 
brilliant saves in the third period. ``He's had a lot of stuff 
happen to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were just all taking it in and focusing on this game. It  
was a big two points for us, and I'm sure he's happy about that. 
But most of all, we're happy that he's back around here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers, who got John LeClair, Mark Recchi and Eric  
Desjardins back from injuries, moved past the Penguins to take over 
fifth place in the Eastern Conference with four games left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins lost their third straight to increase their  
season-high winless streak to eight games (0-6-2). It was their 
10th consecutive loss in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros showed no signs of additional bleeding, Kaiser said  
Thursday. Lindros canceled plans to come to the arena and meet with 
teammates before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you could say he was very disappointed,'' Kaiser said.  
``He was under the impression that this was behind him and he was 
on his way home. I think he dislikes being in the hospital. He was 
clearly disappointed, but he understands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser said the operation involved inserting a tube and a  
microscopic camera through small incisions in Lindros' chest. The 
material and clotted blood was not in the lung, but in the area 
between the lung and the diaphragm. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors don't know for sure what caused about six pints of blood  
to seep into Lindros' chest after a 2-1 victory over the Nashville 
Predators last Thursday. Kaiser said the blood likely seeped from 
his lung, adding that he found no evidence that a blood vessel had 
ruptured. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros was pale and coughing intermittently during a brief news  
conference before being released from Baptist Hospital Thursday and 
flying home to Philadelphia. He said he was ``getting better every 
day,'' but understood the seriousness of his injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't worry about the next game,'' he said. ``You don't  
worry about the first round. You wonder what's going to happen in 
the next hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have said Lindros needs three to four weeks to  
regenerate the blood he lost. He continues to insist on not having 
a transfusion, and Kaiser is following those instructions. The 
playoffs begin April 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst-case scenario is I don't come back until  
September,'' Lindros said. ``But I think because of the jump-start 
we had here and the good care here, I might be on my way back much 
sooner than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers aren't counting on it.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's not our main concern, getting Eric back,'' said  
LeClair, who tied Lindros for the team lead with his 40th goal. 
``Our main concern is getting Eric healthy.''

<HEADLINE> Tigers Put Florie on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pitcher Bryce Florie was placed on the 15-day  
disabled list by the Detroit Tigers on Friday to make room for 
Beiker Graterol, who was hit hard by the New York Yankees in his 
major league debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Florie, a 28-year-old right-hander, has a strained pitching  
shoulder. The move to disable him when made retroactive to March 
31. 
</P>
<P>
	Graterol, whose contract was purchased from Triple-A Toledo,  
allowed four hits and seven runs in four innings against the 
Yankees, allowing three home runs, including a grand slam by Chili 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	The last pitcher to make his major league debut in a Yankees  
home opener had been Boston's Billy Rohr, who came within one 
strike of a no-hitter before Elston Howard singled on a 3-2 pitch 
on April 14, 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he looked pretty calm and cool under the  
circumstances,'' said Yankees pitcher David Cone, who allowed one 
hit in 5 1-3 innings as New York won 12-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Florie was 8-9 with a 4.20 ERA for Detroit last season in 16  
starts and 26 relief appearances.

<HEADLINE>  Berra Ends Boycott of Yankee Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wandering through the halls that twist and turn  
in the catacombs of Yankee Stadium, Yogi Berra could have used a 
road map. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to find my way back,'' Berra said after ending a 14-year  
exile and returning to throw out the first pitch on opening day 
Friday. ``I got lost. I've got to get my bearings. It's a lot 
different. They fixed it up so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra took over the first-pitch role that Joe DiMaggio held for  
so long. The team remembered DiMaggio, who died March 8 at 84, with 
signs around the ballpark that quoted the Hall of Famer as saying, 
``I want to thank the good Lord for making me a Yankee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the national anthem, fans were asked to remember the  
Yankee Clipper with a moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Berra walked slowly out of the Yankees dugout, favoring a  
gimpy right knee, as a sellout Stadium crowd roared. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was one of the loudest ovations I think I've ever heard  
in Yankee Stadium,'' said Yankees starter David Cone. ``I kind of 
froze in my tracks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Bob Sheppard introduced Berra as ``a great leader and a  
man of conviction,'' he tossed the ceremonial pitch from in front 
of the mound to catcher Joe Girardi. The Yankees defeated Detroit 
12-3 in a game ended in the seventh inning because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra, who played for 10 World Series championship teams with  
the Yankees, vowed he would never return to the Stadium after owner 
George Steinbrenner fired him as manager after just 16 games in 
1985. He resisted repeated overtures to return for games, even when 
former teammates attempted to intercede. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been asking him to come back for years,'' said old  
batterymate Whitey Ford, who joined Phil Rizzuto to raise the 1998 
World Series championship banner. ``I told him, `I don't care what 
you think of Steinbrenner, the people miss you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	This winter, spurred by DiMaggio's illness, Steinbrenner  
apologized to Berra and the feud was settled. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra arrived at the Stadium early Friday and visited interim  
manager Don Zimmer, a friend who coached with Berra during one of 
Billy Martin's terms as Yankee manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yogi and I became really close the last three years,'' said  
Zimmer, who returned to the team in 1996 as bench coach for Joe 
Torre. ``Yogi would call me four or five times each summer, saying, 
`How ya doin', kid? How ya doin', kid?' We became very close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the moments before the first pitch, Berra sat on the Yankees  
bench, flanked by his two pals, Zimmer on one side, Ford on the 
other. The Yankees cap fit just like the old days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little nervous out there,'' he said. ``The first day,  
you're always a little nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially after 14 years away.  
</P>
<P>
	Berra said the feud with Steinbrenner never affected his  
feelings for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always a Yankees fan,'' he said. ``I rooted for them. I  
watched on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, it was time for the quarrel to be settled.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was happy to come in today,'' Berra said. ``I'm glad it's  
over with. It's good to be back. Everything worked out fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra said he'd return to the Stadium later this month when the  
Yankees unveil a monument to DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe some other games, too,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ford was surprised to be included in first-day ceremonies. He  
said he remembered pennants being raised. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was usually in the bullpen, warming up,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Then, in the stream of consciousness fashion that is uniquely  
Yogi, Berra wondered out loud about the flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was it heavy?'' he asked Ford.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nah,'' the old pitcher replied. ``I was worried about Rizzuto,  
though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No problem. The banner went up without a hitch and so did  
Berra's first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not bad,'' Berra said. ``I thought I'd do worse, but I  
did all right.''

<HEADLINE> Massacre Threatens East Timor Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Last month, a man with gangrene in his  
leg had two choices: ask an Indonesian army medic for surgery or 
seek traditional treatment in the hills of East Timor. Suspicious 
of the army doctor, he left town. 
</P>
<P>
	The story, recounted today by an American doctor who was caring  
for injured survivors of a massacre this week, tells how deep 
hostilities ran in East Timor even before the slaughter in Liquica 
town by pro-Indonesian militiamen. 
</P>
<P>
	Religious leaders say at least 25 people died in the assault at  
a Roman Catholic church Tuesday. Local human rights activists put 
the death toll at twice that. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings overshadowed U.N.-sponsored talks on a peaceful  
solution to the long-running conflict, although another round of 
negotiations was expected to go ahead as planned this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet concerns are mounting about whether a U.N.-supervised vote  
that could open the way for independence in the former Portuguese 
colony can go ahead as scheduled in July amid escalating unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and has been accused of  
human rights abuses ever since. But the government recently agreed 
to let go of the poor territory if its 800,000 people reject an 
autonomy offer in a ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Liquica massacre, militiamen who want East Timor to stay  
part of Indonesia attacked villagers suspected of being separatist 
sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and soldiers allegedly took part in the bloodshed. The  
military said they didn't, and has promised to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	There are at least 10,000 Indonesian soldiers in East Timor. Up  
to 700 guerrillas operate in remote mountain camps, and 
occasionally stage hit-and-run attacks. The rebels' military might 
has dwindled since Indonesian campaigns dealt them heavy losses in 
the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Dili clinic run by Carmelite nuns, nurses today tended some  
of the dozens of victims of the attack in Liquica, 20 miles west of 
the provincial capital. 
</P>
<P>
	An elderly man lay in a bed, his right eye black and swollen  
from the blow of a rifle butt. One woman was recuperating from 
sword slashes on her back, suffered when she threw herself over her 
three-month-old girl to protect the child. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had one guy who was shot in the abdomen. He died,'' said  
Dan Murphy, a clinic doctor from Alton, Iowa. ``We aren't equipped 
to deal with any of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy described how a man with a severe leg wound, allegedly  
inflicted by pro-Indonesian militiamen last month, was too wary to 
consider asking the army doctor for surgery. He left Dili and the 
clinic has not been heard from him since. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Liquica killings, the next round of U.N.-sponsored  
talks between senior Indonesian and Portuguese officials was 
expected to take place April 21. The United Nations, which 
considers Portugal the administering power in East Timor, is eager 
to keep the plan for a July ballot on autonomy on track. 
</P>
<P>
	The massacre Tuesday was one of the biggest in East Timor since  
1991, when Indonesian soldiers shot and killed dozens of 
pro-independence demonstrators at a Dili cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	After an international outcry, a government inquiry led to the  
transfer of two senior army officers and a few months imprisonment 
for some lower-ranking soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Power Plants Drilled for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The electric power industry says a  
much-hyped test of its readiness for the Year 2000 bug was a 
success. But skeptics still wonder if the New Year will dawn in 
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, critics say, is that Friday's drill didn't tell  
consumers anything about whether power will keep flowing to their 
switches in the event of massive computer glitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been planning this drill since the beginning of the  
year,'' said Randy Guidry, managing editor of Y2K News Magazine. 
``I would compare it to a student in high school taking a test 
after he's had three months to make up the questions on the test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power plants across the country shared information via radio  
rather than computer Friday to test whether they could keep the 
lights on even if the Y2K bug knocks out communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's power grids depend on communications between  
generating stations so that operators can send electricity to 
regions that need it the most from power plants able to provide it. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at hundreds of sites called in meter readings via  
handheld radios and logged in data manually, rather than using 
computers hooked together via fiber-optic lines and microwave 
transmitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``People just flick a switch and expect their power to go on,  
but it's important to ensure that the grid is reliable and 
communications are a piece of that,'' said Tom Williams, spokesman 
for Duke Energy Power Services, which has three plants in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	The drill was a success, according to a news release posted on  
the Web site of the North American Electric Reliability Council, a 
New Jersey-based industry group assigned by the U.S. Department of 
Energy to make sure the nation's utilities are ready for the new 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the council said some backup systems did not work as  
planned and some workers may require additional training on the 
satellite voice systems. The group also said severe lightning 
storms in the Midwest interfered with some radio systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the council would not comment on the tests  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Utility customers weren't affected because the drill did not  
test electricity production. And that's what concerns observers 
like Guidry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today doesn't have anything to do with the ability to produce  
energy,'' he said. ``It has to do with their ability to talk to 
each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem occurs because many computers are programmed to  
recognize only the last two digits of a year and, without repairs, 
may malfunction beginning Jan. 1 when they might assume it is 1900. 
Some fear national communication and power systems could be 
disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	NERC's job is to help make sure electrical utilities are ready  
for the possibility of a Y2K glitch and spotty outages or -- a 
worse-case scenario -- complete electricity shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The loonies out there who are profiting by panic over Y2K may  
not have it quite right,'' said John Castagna, a spokesman for the 
Washington-based Edison Electric Institute, an industry group whose 
members generate about three-quarters of the country's electricity. 
``We're working hard to make sure January 1, 2000, is just like 
every other day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Cowles, author of ``Electric Utilities and Y2K,'' praised  
the communications drill. But he said there is no way to replicate 
the conditions plants may encounter on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Testing a portion of the entire Y2K program is part of the  
contingency planning,'' he said. ``But this is a drill -- a drill 
that's not operationally testing anything. There's no way to test 
absolutely everything.''

<HEADLINE> Oakland Tribune May Buy Part of A's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Oakland Tribune has joined an  
investor group that is considering making an offer to buy the 
Oakland Athletics, the newspaper reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	With the deadline looming for the $112 million sale of the team  
to a local group that would keep the team in place, the Tribune 
joined former A's executive Andy Dolich. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolich's group includes Men's Wearhouse chief George Zimmer,  
Save Mart Foods chairman Robert Piccinini, advertising executive 
Jeff Goodby and other investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Any group that decides to make an offer will have to put down  
$12 million by April 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``If everything comes together, there is a very high probability  
that the Tribune will be a partner with Dolich's local ownership 
group,'' newspaper publisher Scott McKibben said Thursday. ``We are 
very interested in the A's staying in Oakland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oakland Tribune is owned by the ANG Newspapers, a regional  
subsidiary of MediaNews Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely enthused about having the Tribune join our  
group,'' Dolich said. ``We will continue to work up to the deadline 
to add local individuals and entities that are enthused about 
keeping the A's in Oakland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other groups have expressed interest in buying the team. The  
only other one to go public includes Hollywood executives Peter 
Guber and Paul Schaeffer of Mandalay Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	In a settlement reached last December, A's current owners Steve  
Schott and Ken Hofmann agreed to put the team up for sale for a 
nonnegotiable $122 million, about 90 percent of the market value. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, the owners got favorable lease terms at the Oakland  
Coliseum and a year-to-year lease starting after 2001.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Refugees Lost in Confusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZDA, Macedonia (AP) -- Aid agencies and Western nations are  
struggling to organize aid distribution to nearly half a million 
Kosovo Albanian refugees camped in tents and packed into private 
homes across Macedonia and Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, was to  
make a visit today to one of the largest tent camps in Macedonia, 
set up by NATO troops to shelter some of the more than 400,000 
refugees who fled Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Albania has accepted roughly 75 percent of the refugees, UNHCR  
said. A few thousand others have gone to Turkey, Germany and 
Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, NATO said it will send about 8,000 troops to  
Albania to help with logistics, infrastructure and coordination at 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The main airport in the capital, Tirana, has been swamped with  
humanitarian flights bringing in tons of aid from more than 30 
countries trying to help UNHCR deal with the tide of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, 15 humanitarian flights requested flight clearance  
to land at Tirana's airport, but only eight were actually allowed 
to land, said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 14 planes were scheduled to land there today.  
</P>
<P>
	Once aid arrives, it has to be distributed. While tens of  
thousands of refugees have been housed in makeshift camps near the 
border town of Kukes, still others have been spread out to cities 
and towns throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending days in the squalid Blace border camp between  
Yugoslavia and Macedonia, about 12,000 Kosovo Albanians arrived in 
the town of Korca. Some were taken in by locals, but hundreds of 
others remained camped in the civic sports arena without mattresses 
or running water. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, men took turns shaving, while women washed their  
hair with laundry detergent and cold water poured from soft drink 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know where they (the Macedonians) were taking us,''  
said Mustaf Beka, 40. ``We got scared because the rumor spread that 
we would be taken back to Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the trip lasted about 10 hours, and people were asking  
Macedonian drivers to stop, but they wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Other refugees were bused to camps run by NATO troops like the  
one at Brazda inside Macedonia. The 2,000-tent city on an abandoned 
airstrip houses between 20,000 and 25,000 refugees. Resources at 
the camp are stretched as well. On Thursday, people were forced to 
wait hours in line for half-loaves of bread.

<HEADLINE> McDougal Deliberations To Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In a wild day at Susan McDougal's  
trial, a judge abruptly halted jury deliberations after a juror 
brought a law book to the courthouse. But, after concluding that no 
jury tampering occurred, the judge told the panel to resume its 
work next week, skirting a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Deliberations were frozen after a court clerk seized the juror's  
book, which had belonged to former Arkansas Supreme Court Justice 
John I. Purtle, an acquaintance of Mrs. McDougal, her ex-husband 
and President and Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. initially planned to seek  
an FBI probe into possible jury tampering. He changed his mind 
after questioning juror Michael Nance and Purtle, who sold his 
house to Nance in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left some books and no doubt this is one of them,'' Purtle  
told the judge and lawyers for both sides. Purtle's business card 
was found in the book that Nance carried into the jury room. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate questioning by the judge, Nance said he found the  
book in a room of the house he bought from Purtle through a real 
estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard said ``this court finds that'' Nance ``has not  
communicated with any third party ... and has not considered any 
factual matters or evidence extraneous to the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Starr's prosecutors wanted Nance dismissed, but McDougal  
lawyer Mark Geragos urged that all 12 jurors be kept on, or he 
would ask for a mistrial. Ruling that Nance would remain, the judge 
told the jurors to resume their deliberations on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal is accused of two counts of criminal contempt and  
one count of obstruction for refusing to testify before a grand 
jury convened in the independent counsel's investigation of the 
Clintons. The jury began deliberations Thursday in the month-long 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	It is possible to continue a federal trial with only 11 jurors  
if the defendant doesn't object. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr prosecutor Mark Barrett said that Nance appeared to have  
improperly engaged in ``self-help,'' using the book to assist in 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	Purtle's law book on state and federal court rules has in it  
handwriting and a highlighted portion saying prospective jurors 
shall receive instructions explaining legal terminology. 
</P>
<P>
	Nance may have brought the law book to the jury room out of  
frustration. Jurors had asked Howard to clarify certain legal 
terms, but the judge responded by referring them back to their 
written instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors wanted to know if they could find there was an  
``innocent reason'' for Mrs. McDougal to have refused to answer 
grand jury questions in 1996 and 1998 in Starr's probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal says she refused to testify out of fear that Starr  
would charge her with perjury unless she falsely implicated the 
Clintons in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Purtle said he knows Mrs. McDougal and Clinton, and he worked  
with Mrs. Clinton on a legal case in the early 1990s before she 
became first lady. He said he's had no contact with Nance and has 
no connection to the McDougal trial, but feels strongly that Mrs. 
McDougal shouldn't be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	In interviews with The Associated Press earlier in the day,  
Purtle at first said he didn't know Nance. But Purtle later said he 
sold his house to Nance when asked about records that connected 
both men to the same address in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office said that Purtle, while he was on the state  
Supreme Court, sided with Mrs. McDougal and her husband in a case 
that involved a branch office for a bank they owned in northern 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors also noted that on the day Clinton's friend,  
Webster Hubbell, was sentenced for stealing nearly $400,000 from 
his law firm and its clients, Purtle, who by then had left the 
court, was quoted as saying ``I don't know why they've made a 
federal case out of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos told Howard he thinks notes sent by the jury suggest  
that the panel has already reached a verdict on an obstruction of 
justice charge against Mrs. McDougal. Howard had told the jurors 
earlier that on the two criminal contempt counts, they could not 
consider Mrs. McDougal's assertion that Starr wanted her to lie. He 
said they could consider it in the obstruction count. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos said he wouldn't want Nance knocked off the jury, and  
then have the 11 remaining jurors have to begin deliberating anew 
on all three charges against her.

<HEADLINE> WTO Talks Fail Despite Concessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a flurry of last-minute bargaining, China  
made big concessions to lower trade barriers for American financial 
service firms, telecommunication companies and a wide array of 
other U.S. industries anxiously hoping to gain entry to China's 
vast market. 
</P>
<P>
	A deal still didn't come together, however, and many trade  
experts think President Clinton may have let a golden opportunity 
slip away. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, faced with congressional anger over  
allegations of Chinese nuclear espionage and human rights 
violations, insisted Friday it had no choice but to demand even 
further Chinese concessions to have a hope of winning necessary 
congressional support. 
</P>
<P>
	Whoever is right, there is no doubt that Zhu Rongji, the first  
Chinese premier to visit America in 15 years, came ready to deal. 
Chinese negotiators put an amazing number of trade concessions on 
the table during four days of marathon bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech Friday night, Zhu said, ``We have truly made very,  
very major concessions. Despite all the concessions, the U.S. 
continues to press for further concessions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to a dinner gathering sponsored by seven organizations  
which support closer ties with China, Zhu said, ``If you want too 
much too soon, in the end you may wind up with nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China agreed to slash high border tariffs on thousands of  
American products, from cars to corn; to open up its vast retail 
banking system to U.S. banks; and to drop demands that American 
high-technology companies share their technology as a condition of 
landing contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, China also agreed to allow American  
telecommunications companies controlling interests in firms serving 
a vast potential market where only one in 10 households now has a 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
	American industries, who have dreamed of cracking the Chinese  
market for decades, could barely contain their glee at the 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Flannigan, president of the Telecommunications Industry  
Association, said ``potential sales are staggering'' once a deal is 
approved. Eastman Kodak Chairman George Fisher called the Chinese 
offers a ``massive list of achieved U.S. goals and realized U.S. 
hopes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hitch is that China made the offers contingent on getting  
U.S. approval for an overall package that would allow China to 
enter the World Trade Organization. In the end, Clinton vetoed 
signing off on a final deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, beseeched by labor unions, the textile  
industry and the steel industry, decided it needed more Chinese 
concessions. Those included a demand from textile manufacturers 
that Chinese goods shipped to America be subjected to quotas for 
five years longer than currently permitted under WTO rules. 
</P>
<P>
	When Zhu, China's leading economic reformer, rejected these  
requests during his meetings this week with Clinton, both sides 
decided to trumpet smaller agreements eliminating long-standing 
Chinese bans on American wheat, citrus and meat, which will go into 
effect immediately, and leave the bigger deal for later 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insisted to reporters Friday  
that the administration still believes agreement on the bigger 
package is possible in coming months in time to allow China to join 
the WTO by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	He rejected suggestions that Clinton's decision to reject Zhu's  
enhanced offers would weaken a man the administration views as the 
leading proponent of economic reform inside China. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is we've made a great deal of progress, and it  
seems to me (Zhu) can correctly and rightly go home and say that he 
had a very successful trip in moving this process forward a very 
long way,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside trade experts were not sure. Many said chances of  
getting a final agreement now in the last two years of the Clinton 
administration were all but dead, especially as the issue gets more 
embroiled in the 2000 elections. Many Republican White House 
hopefuls are already attacking Clinton's policies of cooperation 
with China. 
</P>
<P>
	``We walked away from the best deal we are going to get during  
this administration,'' said Gary Hufbauer, an economist at the 
Institute of International Economics, a Washington think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. business executives, still looking at the tantalizing  
prospects of gaining increased access to China's market, were not 
as pessimistic Friday. Many expressed the hope that U.S. and 
Chinese negotiators will not let the momentum generated by Zhu's 
visit slip away. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Kapp, president of the U.S.-China Business Council,  
representing more than 250 major U.S. companies, said he believed 
once businesses become aware of the full extent of China's market 
opening offers, they will step up their lobbying efforts in 
Congress. But he said it was critical for negotiators to achieve a 
final agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our urgent message to both sides is get it done. No vacations,  
no cooling-off periods,'' Kapp said. ``The time for further 
committed action is now.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Orders McDougal Jury Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The judge in Susan McDougal's trial  
froze jury deliberations today and ordered an FBI investigation of 
possible attempts to influence the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	The chain of events began after it was discovered a juror had  
brought a state law book into the jury room. 
</P>
<P>
	As he ordered the FBI inquiry, U.S. District Judge George Howard  
Jr. also issued a subpoena to bring in for questioning a former 
Arkansas Supreme Court justice whose business card was found in the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors had begun their deliberations Thursday on charges of  
criminal contempt and obstruction stemming from Mrs. McDougal's 
refusal to testify before grand juries investigating her Whitewater 
business partners, President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge announced his intentions today at a conference in his  
chambers with prosecutors and Mrs. McDougal's attorneys present, 
along with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a possibility of jury tampering going on here,  
we've got to root it out,'' said Mark Barrett, one of Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr's prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said he was concerned about the possibility that the  
jury was tainted by the actions of Michael Nance of Little Rock, 
who brought the law book into the jury room. 
</P>
<P>
	The court clerk discovered the volume and retrieved it. Jurors  
told him they hadn't looked at it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be sure that the people still have confidence in  
the federal justice system,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	He ordered the FBI inquiry after a discussion of whether the  
former justice, John I. Purtle, had any connection to Mrs. 
McDougal; whether Nance had been influenced by a factor outside the 
trial and whether the other jurors had been tainted. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, said he favored the  
questioning of Purtle. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Purtle said he sold his house to Nance in 1997  
and that he probably left the law book behind. Purtle said he knows 
Mrs. McDougal and Clinton, and he worked with Mrs. Clinton on a 
legal case before she became first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nance said he has no connection to Nance now and no  
connection to the McDougal trial -- although he feels strongly that 
Mrs. McDougal shouldn't have been prosecuted for criminal contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's prosecutors asked that Nance be dismissed, but Geragos  
urged that all 12 jurors should be kept on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``It occurs to me that while arguably this may be misconduct, it  
may not be so prejudicial that we need to kick him off a jury,'' 
said Geragos. He said he would ask for a mistrial if Nance were 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal court rules allow a trial to proceed with 11 jurors in  
an emergency, if neither the prosecution nor defense objects. If 
either side complains, the judge must decide whether the case 
should go forward, usually giving much greater weight to the 
defendant's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nance brought to the jury room the 1996 Arkansas Criminal Code.  
Barrett said he didn't care that the book didn't apply in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The book contains a handwritten notation referring to a court  
rule that says prospective jurors shall receive instructions 
explaining legal terminology. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, in a note to the judge, the jurors asked whether  
they could consider Mrs. McDougal's state of mind in deciding 
whether she is guilty of criminal contempt for not testifying to 
grand juries in 1996 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Other notes asked for a definition of ``innocent reason'' -- a  
phrase in written instructions for the jury -- and asked whether 
there might have been an ``innocent reason'' for refusing to 
testify, even if Mrs. McDougal acted ``willfully'' in violating a 
court order directing her to cooperate with Starr's probe. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, Howard tossed the question back to the jury,  
referring the panel to the instructions he had read to them. 
</P>
<P>
	During five days on the witness stand, Mrs. McDougal said she  
feared Starr would charge her with perjury unless she falsely 
implicated the Clintons in wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Negro League Star Gene Benson Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Gene Benson, a charismatic outfielder who  
starred in the Negro Leagues in the 1940s and mentored a young 
Jackie Robinson before Robinson broke baseball's racial barrier, 
has died. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson, who played for over a decade in the Negro Leagues in the  
1930s and 40s, died Tuesday. He debuted with the Philadelphia Stars 
in 1937 before being traded to the Pittsburgh Crawfords in 1938. A 
year later, he returned to the Stars, where he played into the late 
1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson had his best years from 1944 to 1946, batting .327, .370,  
and .345, respectively, during those years. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include five grandchildren and six  
great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held Monday in 
Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Amen Corner Takes Bite Out of Tiger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Tiger Woods thought his tee shot on the  
devilish par-3 12th at Augusta National's Amen Corner would knock 
down the flag. 
</P>
<P>
	That was before a gust of wind deposited the ball into Rae's  
Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just one of those things at Augusta,'' Woods said. ``It  
can really reach up and bite you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who came into the Masters as the second favorite behind  
No. 1-ranked David Duval, rallied with a birdie on No. 18 Friday 
for his second 72 that put him eight shots behind leader Jose Maria 
Olazabal after 36 holes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I had hit a perfect shot,'' Woods said of the 8-iron  
tee shot on the 155-yard hole. ``I hit it great all day but had 
just the one mishap when the gusting wind ballooned the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Woods, the 1997 Masters champion, needs one of his big  
weekend charges to win his second green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods has made nine birdies over the first two days but hasn't  
kept away from the occasional lapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those nine birdies show that I'm at least making a lot of  
birdies,'' Woods said. ``Now, I need a series of runs. If I get a 
couple of those I'm back in it. Eight shots is not a lot to make up 
at Augusta. It would be tough but I can do it if I give myself a 
lot of opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods was bothered by one bad hole in the opening round, too.  
</P>
<P>
	He made a triple-bogey 8 on No. 8 Thursday. In that case, Woods  
made a bad swing when he hooked a ball into the trees and had 
trouble recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of bad holes can happen and usually do happen here,''  
said Woods, whose only win this year is at the Buick Invitational. 
He was second at the Nissan Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods lost his No. 1 ranking in the world when Duval won The  
Players Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Masters was billed as a showdown between Duval and Woods.  
</P>
<P>
	However, Duval had a hole which killed his score on Friday,  
making a triple-bogey 8 on No. 15 and he shot a 74 and trails Woods 
by a shot going into the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Moceanu, Parents End Legal Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Olympic champion Dominique Moceanu and her  
parents have reached a financial settlement that ends a protective 
order against the gymnast's father. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly realize that people can make mistakes even when  
their intentions are good,'' Moceanu said in a statement released 
by her Boulder, Colo., publicist at Gold Medal Management. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an extremely difficult time for my family and I  
hope that we can now begin to move forward in support of one 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old gymnast, declared a legal adult Oct. 29, won a  
one-year court order in December that kept her father at least 500 
feet away from her. 
</P>
<P>
	She sought the order after police said they were investigating  
accusations that Dumitru Moceanu, 44, tried to have two of his 
daughter's friends slain. He has denied the accusation. 
</P>
<P>
	The protective order was lifted Thursday by Judge Patricia  
Lykos. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers declined to elaborate on the confidential financial  
settlement. The gymnast, training in Colorado for the 2000 
Olympics, declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Moceanu's lawyer, Ellen Yarrell, said Friday her client is  
``confident that the settlement assures her personal safety and 
achievement of her financial goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dumitru Moceanu did not return a call Friday. His lawyer, Jimmy  
Phillips, would say only that ``the family is back together 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family fight became public last October the gymnast sued for  
her independence. She claimed her father squandered the money she 
had earned during a 10-year professional career. 
</P>
<P>
	Her parents had held her earnings in a trust fund, which they  
administer. She did not have access to the trust until she turned 
35. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father has said all of his daughter's earnings went into  
building a $4 million, 70,000-square-foot gym with his daughter's 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that deep down my father loves me, and of course I love  
him, so I need to find a way in my heart to give him forgiveness,'' 
the gymnast's statement read. ``I hope there is a chance that 
someday things in my family can be normal again.''

<HEADLINE> Six Dead in Midwest, Plains Storms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Thunderstorms demolished about 200 houses in  
two Cincinnati suburbs before daybreak today, killing four people 
and leaving normally manicured yards littered with bricks, broken 
two-by-fours and tattered roofs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other people were killed in Illinois as powerful storms tore  
through the Midwest overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Cincinnati suburbs of Montgomery and Blue Ash, water  
spewed into the air from broken fire hydrants. Shopping center 
parking lots were strewn with broken glass, and sheet metal that 
had been siding was wrapped around utility poles. Scores of trees 
were flattened. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsey Stiffler, 13, was asleep in her bedroom with the window  
open in Montgomery when she heard rain and hail and then a roaring 
noise. She looked out, saw the storm, and fled to the basement with 
her family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could hear everything flying through the house, smashing  
around,'' she said. ``I didn't realize what was going on until I 
got outside. There was glass on the ground. The carport was lying 
against the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The back portion of her neighbor's wooden house was split in  
two, with one side leaning over, she said. Elsewhere on her street, 
``there were mattresses and curtains and everything sticking out of 
the windows,'' she said. ``Roofs were ripped off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were killed in a house, and two in separate car  
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the victims, a 40-year-old man, was thrown from his car  
when the wind flipped it over, Blue Ash Police Chief Mike Allen 
said. The same gust flipped a tractor-trailer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio's Emergency Management Agency estimated 200 homes were  
destroyed in Cincinnati's northeastern suburbs alone. The utility 
Cinergy said about 200,000 customers lost power. Most service had 
been restored by the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm also flipped motor homes and campers that convert to  
tents at the Dave Arbogast dealership in Tipp City, north of 
Dayton. ``We got about 10 tent campers in a nice, neat pile,'' said 
Ron West, a manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bob Taft said officials had no estimate of damage. He  
declared three counties emergency areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw homes where walls were torn down and chairs, tables and  
computers were sitting there untouched,'' he said. ``It's a total 
rebuilding effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Ashland, Ill., a community of 1,200, winds ripped into a  
trailer park and killed a 68-year-old woman. And a 43-year-old 
woman was killed in a mobile home in Cisco, 65 miles to the east. 
</P>
<P>
	In both Illinois and Ohio, the National Weather Service could  
not immediately determine whether tornadoes had struck. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms also damaged homes in Indiana. In Iowa, at least nine  
suspected tornadoes destroyed homes, flattened barns and uprooted 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
	A hay baler and other farm equipment were overturned on Deb  
Frisbie's farm near Adair, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``We barely made it to the basement,'' she said. ``We didn't  
really hear anything. All I was worried about was getting everybody 
to the basement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado also ravaged a five-block area in the Nebraska town of  
North Bend on Thursday afternoon, and the storm damaged buildings 
and downed power lines in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was napping,'' said Margaret Linville, whose barn was  
destroyed in Barnard, Mo. ``When I roused, the barn was gone, 
debris was still flying.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat Lower at CBOT Open / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures were sharply lower at the open  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat continued its decline from Thursday as the market reacted  
to news that while U.S. supplies remained stable, world wheat 
inventories were significantly higher, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants were also wary as the harvest approaches and  
crop condition has been consistently rated good to excellent. 
</P>
<P>
	May wheat dipped to its lowest level in five weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures were slightly higher at the open, getting  
support from a decline in U.S. supplies, analysts said. Argentina 
crop estimates were also slightly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn was slightly higher at the open with continued wet weather  
in U.S. growing regions keeping farmers from the fields. Gains were 
limited as the losses in wheat pressured corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery fell 8 cents to $2.66 3/4 a bushel; May corn  
rose 1/2 cent to $2.17 a bushel; May oats fell 1/4 cent to $1.16 1/2 a 
bushel; May soybeans rose 1 3/4 cents to $4.79 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork futures were mostly higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange today. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .38 cent to 64.15 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle rose .18 cent to 73.05 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
were up .55 cent to 54.30 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .50 
cent to 52.35 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole Outlines Abortion Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole said today she supports the  
idea of a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion but feels the 
idea is politically unfeasible -- a position similar to one that has 
brought GOP presidential rival George W. Bush criticism from some 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole wrote in a letter to a supporter that she is  
anti-abortion. However, like Texas Gov. Bush, she said she believes 
abortion should be allowed in cases of rape or incest, or when 
pregnancy might endanger the life of a mother. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Red Cross president and Republican Cabinet secretary  
has been criticized by some in the conservative wing of the party 
for not having taken a position on the hotly debated topic. 
</P>
<P>
	Her letter, released by aides, was written in response to a  
question by a supporter at an Arizona Republican Party event last 
week: ``How can we preserve our ideals and our party, too?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We must recognize that good and honorable people disagree on  
the subject of abortion,'' Mrs. Dole wrote. ``We should agree to 
respectfully disagree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One conservative activist quickly criticized her stance.  
</P>
<P>
	``That position means she is willing to accept the status quo  
and cannot be counted on to do anything'' new, said Phyllis 
Schlafly, president of the Eagle Forum. ``It seems to be a way of 
saying the status quo is all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole said that a constitutional amendment is not a  
realistic possibility in today's political climate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would support the idea of a constitutional amendment, if it  
were possible,'' she wrote. ``But, of course, it's not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole also stressed that she does not want the campaign to  
focus on the contentious issue of abortion, particularly on 
candidates' stances on a constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is such an inordinate focus on an amendment that urgent  
issues such as domestic violence, child care, sexual harassment, 
women's health and the financial security of women are nearly 
ignored,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	After a speech Friday in Beverly Hills, Calif., Mrs. Dole told  
reporters that the debate over a constitutional amendment on 
abortion was divisive and irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The amendment is not going to pass,'' she said. ``There's been  
no vote in the House of Representatives in modern times and there 
hasn't been a vote in the Senate in 15 years, so rather than engage 
in dead-end debate, let's move forward to get some positive things 
done for this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When her husband, former Sen. Bob Dole, ran for the presidency  
in 1996, he also supported a constitutional amendment banning 
abortion except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the 
mother. He tried to amend the Republican platform to allow for 
differences of opinion on abortion but was thwarted by 
anti-abortion members of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, too, is attempting to keep the party open on such  
matters, said a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elizabeth Dole plans to run an inclusive campaign,'' said  
communications director Ari Fleischer. ``She will not allow the 
party to rip itself apart.''

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Universal Studios plans to sell its interest  
in the commercial, music video and talent management businesses of 
Propaganda Films Holdings Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Entertainment entrepreneur Gary Beer, cable pioneer Jack Crosby  
and the investment fund SCP Private Equity Partners would buy 
Universal's share under the proposed deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	``This sale recognizes the value of Propaganda's nonfeature film  
assets, and is consistent with Universal's objective of focusing on 
its core movie business,'' said Rick Finkelstein, Universal's 
senior vice president for corporate development and strategic 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Propaganda Films is an independent Hollywood production company  
specializing in commercials, music videos, motion pictures and

<P>
	On Wednesday, Montreal-based Seagram Co., the parent company of  
Universal Studios, sold its art house labels October Films and 
Gramercy Pictures and the remains of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment

</P>
<P>
	The deal was yet another move to reduce the company's debt load

<HEADLINE> Hydrogen Release Caused Fla. Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Hydrogen gas improperly left in a generator  
caused a blast at a power plant that killed two workers and injured 
49, the company said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The hydrogen gas was inside the generator when contractors  
prepared to do routine maintenance on the machine Thursday, Mike 
Mahoney of Tampa Electric Co. said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gas, which is contained in a closed, pressurized system,  
must be removed before maintenance is attempted, but the generator 
still had hydrogen in it when it was taken off line, Mahoney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And without a directive from a manager, someone opened the lid  
at the top of the housing of the blade. Hydrogen detonated because 
it was under high pressure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahoney said procedures were violated, but he did not know  
exactly what went wrong. Teams of investigators interviewed workers 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast on Thursday ripped a huge section from a building  
holding six coal-fired generators. The force of the explosion 
hurled 200-pound siding tiles across an electrical yard and was 
heard at least 35 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion was labeled accidental, Emergency Medical Services  
Capt. Cliff Hitchman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, four men remained hospitalized, two in critical  
condition, two in fair condition.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Fund-Raiser To Be Deposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A central figure in the Clinton campaign  
finance controversy, former Commerce Department official and 
Democratic fund-raiser John Huang, was ordered to answer questions 
under oath. 
</P>
<P>
	A conservative group, Judicial Watch, is using a lawsuit to  
pursue allegations that the administration sold seats on trade 
missions for political donations. U.S. District Judge Royce 
Lamberth on Friday ordered Huang to answer questions at a 
deposition Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Judicial Watch Chairman Larry Klayman said his questioning of  
Huang will focus on Commerce's trade missions to China. Among those 
on the missions was Johnny Chung, who reportedly has told Justice 
Department investigators he funneled illegal contributions from 
China to help re-elect President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that on the trade missions to China, contacts were  
made with Chinese agents which resulted in some of the illegal 
transactions reported recently,'' Klayman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang, who was unsuccessfully sought as a witness by  
congressional investigators, testified in the Judicial Watch case 
in October 1996. Lamberth gave the group permission to depose him 
again. Klayman said the group now has Huang's diaries, which ``give 
us a road map for questioning Mr. Huang thoroughly about his 
relevant campaign finance activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huang's lawyer, Ty Cobb, did not return a call seeking comment  
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Man Breaks Quarantine, Is Jailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Miguel Arredondo sits in a jail cell  
equipped with a special ventilation system, his human contact 
restricted to nurses whose faces are obscured by masks. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of his incarceration, prosecutors say, is simple human  
contact. 
</P>
<P>
	Arredondo, who suffers from an incurable strain of tuberculosis,  
is accused of breaking his quarantine and exposing his 
grandchildren to the disease. Two of the children now have it. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Arredondo's family are also accused of helping him  
break the quarantine. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were all under written orders not to let the children  
contact their grandfather. They had been explained the dangers. 
They all knew. And they broke the quarantine anyway,'' prosecutor 
Stephen Taylor said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arredondo, 54, had been ordered two years ago to stay away from  
everyone except his wife, who chose to risk infection and live with 
him in their Stockton apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Joaquin County Health Department even paid their rent,  
but one of his nurses alerted authorities after seeing a child 
enter the apartment last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests showed his 1-year-old grandson and 2-year-old  
granddaughter are infected with the same drug-resistant strain of 
TB. The status of a third grandchild is not yet known. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Arredondo on charges of violating an official  
health order, a misdemeanor that carries up to a year in jail. In 
addition, his son, daughter and daughter-in-law face the same 
charge and child endangerment charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who has prosecuted more than two dozen such cases, said  
the children are in grave danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little babies go fast'' when infected by this kind of  
tuberculosis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Dr. Karen Furst, a county health officer, said the  
children's prognosis is better than their grandfather's. 
</P>
<P>
	``When somebody's infected with a TB germ that is already  
drug-resistant, they tend to do better in treatment'' than whoever 
infected them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Arredondo is being held in one of San Joaquin  
County's half-dozen ``negative air flow'' rooms. Air from the cell 
is sent outside the building rather than circulated into the jail's 
common ventilation system. 
</P>
<P>
	No one but the nurses who bring Arredondo meals or medication  
are allowed inside his cell. Television, books and a phone 
constitute his only other contact with the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials fear Arredondo could spread the disease if  
deported to his native Mexico. Tuberculosis is an airborne disease 
spread only through prolonged, close-quarters contact. In most 
cases, it is easily cured. But if the disease goes undiagnosed or 
untreated, it can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	TB increasingly is becoming resistant to medication. There have  
been outbreaks of drug-resistant tuberculosis in Russia, the 
Dominican Republic, Argentina and the Ivory Coast.

<HEADLINE> UN Seeks NATO Help With War Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Expressing shock at the treatment  
of Kosovo's refugees, the president of the Yugoslav war crimes 
tribunal urged NATO to help the U.N. court track down possible 
atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to NATO foreign ministers written Tuesday and  
released Thursday, tribunal President Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of 
the United States expressed shock at the events of the past days 
and called for joint international action. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign ministers of 15 European countries were meeting in  
Luxembourg this week to decide how to cope with the mass departure 
from Kosovo of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am stunned and horrified by the recent reports from Kosovo  
of the overwhelming number of refugees fleeing to neighboring 
states,'' McDonald wrote. ``Many of these refugees recount 
experiences that, if true, belong in a time and place that we are 
supposed to have left behind: allegations of indiscriminate 
violence, destruction and theft of property, mass roundups, and 
systematic torture, rape and murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald, who recently announced her early departure from the  
tribunal, called on the international community to ``actively 
assist'' in helping the tribunal to investigate, prosecute and 
conduct trials against suspected war criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	``All states in possession of information pertaining to the  
alleged commissions of crimes within the jurisdiction of the 
tribunal should make such information available without delay to 
the prosecutor,'' McDonald wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter echoed requests Wednesday by the tribunal's deputy  
prosecutor, Graham Blewitt, that NATO should keep its promise to 
hand over potential evidence of atrocities.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Billboards Being Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. (AP) -- For years, the billboard cowboy with  
the rugged good looks has been associated with lighting up a 
Marlboro. 
</P>
<P>
	But now anti-tobacco groups are planning to use faux Marlboro  
men as symbols of lung cancer, emphysema and other smoking-related 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Billboards in 26 states soon will feature images of two  
horseback-riding cowboys saying things like, ``I miss my lung, 
Bob'' and ``Bob, I've got emphysema.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ads are being paid for with money from the $206 billion  
settlement reached by major tobacco companies and 39 states suing 
to recover tobacco-related heath care costs. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement, the companies agreed to remove their  
billboard ads, but keep paying for the space until their leases 
expire so that anti-smoking groups can use them. 
</P>
<P>
	A portion of the settlement money, $1.45 billion, has been  
earmarked for a five-year national anti-smoking campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The cowboy billboards, designed by the California Department of  
Health Services, will start going up April 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to counter really strong images put out by the tobacco  
industry, and there's no stronger one than the Marlboro man,'' said 
Colleen Stevens, chief of California's tobacco education program. 
``You really have to twist it somehow ... to show that there's 
nothing healthy, rugged or outdoorish about what happens when you 
smoke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have  
also designed billboard ads that will be used in various states. 
Some of those focus on children, with one reading: ``First hamster, 
5 years; first cartwheel, 8 years; first cigarette, 11 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The states that plan to use the anti-smoking billboards designed  
by California, Massachusetts and the FDA include: Alabama, 
Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, 
Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, 
North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, 
Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The other 13 states in the settlement chose to do their own  
billboards. They are: Arizona, Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, 
Michigan, New Mexico, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
South Dakota, Washington and Wisconsin.

<P>
	TRAIL, Ore. (AP) -- Frank O. Cordeiro Jr., who took historic  
photographs of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and Gen. Douglas 
MacArthur signing the Japanese surrender aboard the USS Missouri, 
died Monday. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordeiro's career began at age 17 as a Honolulu high school  
student armed with a 35mm Leica camera borrowed from a teacher. An 
editor at the Honolulu Star Bulletin had asked him to snap a few 
shots of military maneuvers at the Navy base on a quiet Sunday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	From his vantage point on Dec. 7, 1941, he captured the USS Shaw  
exploding into a ball of flames. That famous photograph, seen 
around the world, rallied Americans for battle. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Army and, after being wounded in combat in the  
Philippines, exchanged his rifle for a camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordeiro earned a Bronze Star for his photography behind enemy  
lines in Korea. He retired in 1964 as a master sergeant, moving 
from Japan to the Rogue Valley in southern Oregon.

</P>
<P>
	During his career, Beck acted for the Royal Shakespeare Company

dramas. He was best known in Britain for his role in the 1985 
television series, ``Edge of Darkness,'' about the threat of 
nuclear pollution.

	ROSSMOOR, Calif. (AP) -- Paleontologist Donald Elvin Savage, a  
world-renowned expert on the origin of mammals, died Monday of 
pancreatic cancer. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Savage, an expert on the evolution of anthropoid apes, was  
professor emeritus of paleontology at University of California at 
Berkeley and former director of the school's Museum of 
Paleontology. He also was an authority on San Francisco Bay area 
fossils. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus of his work was correlating mammal fossils with  
specific geologic formations. The method was used to date fossils 
before radioisotope became the standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Savage made a major find, a 40 million-year-old primate jaw,  
with a student in Burma in 1978. It remains one of the earliest 
known fossils of higher primates.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Down; Corn, Soybeans Up / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures fell Friday on the Chicago Board of  
Trade, while soybeans and corn rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat spent much of the day sharply lower -- the May contract  
dipped to its lowest level in five weeks -- before a late rally cut 
the losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The selling was spurred by news that while U.S. supplies  
remained stable, world wheat inventories were significantly higher, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also remained under pressure with the harvest approaching  
and crop conditions consistently rated good to excellent. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures rose Friday after the U.S. Agriculture  
Department supply/demand report, which showed a decline in U.S. 
supplies, analysts said. Argentina crop estimates were also 
slightly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn was higher with continued wet weather in U.S. growing  
regions keeping farmers from the fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 3 cents to $2.65 3/4 a bushel; May  
corn rose 1 1/4 cent to $2.17 3/4 a bushel; May oats were unchanged at 
$1.16 3/4 a bushel; May soybeans rose 3 1/4 cents to $4.80 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork futures were mostly higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose 1.43 cent to 65.20 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle rose 0.95 cent to 73.82 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
were up 0.97 cent to 54.72 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose 
0.35 cent to 52.20 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Has Russia in Cold War Mood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Almost a decade after the Soviet Union collapsed,  
Russia is resounding with Cold War rhetoric and gestures as 
politicians, officials and journalists denounce NATO attacks on 
Yugoslavia as an imperialist plot. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead in the anti-NATO rampage has been taken by the  
communists, the largest opposition party, who have eagerly dusted 
off Cold War slogans as the fear grows among Russians that NATO is 
a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Others have joined in. Russian generals have put out wildly  
exaggerated claims of NATO losses and claimed weapons of mass 
destruction are being used against civilians. Russian officials 
mutter about American plans for global domination. And much of the 
Russian press has portrayed Yugoslavia as a gallant little nation 
single-handedly battling the forces of Western oppression. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anti-Western hysteria still rages in some Russian news  
organizations,'' press commentator Leonid Bershidsky wrote in The 
Moscow Times, adding that some Russian journalists ``can turn on a 
dime when it comes to reverting to the 1970s style of writing about 
the West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few officials and organizations have gone beyond rhetoric,  
kicking out or banning Americans and other Westerners. Although a 
far cry from the days when the Soviets and the West practiced mass 
expulsions and boycotts, a few American athletes, missionaries and 
others have been denied visas or told long-planned visits are no 
longer welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	The actions, mostly by low-ranking officials or nongovernment  
groups, are not condoned by the government, and some have been 
quietly reversed. Four American teachers dismissed by a St. 
Petersburg business school were given their jobs back within days 
when senior officials intervened. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin's government, which opposes the  
airstrikes, has been working to restart talks to solve the crisis. 
While harshly denouncing NATO, the government has said it won't get 
involved in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's government knows the country has neither the military  
muscle nor the wealth to even think of risking a confrontation. The 
economy is in crisis and the military in shambles, short even of 
food and uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	But that has only encouraged the opposition, who see Yeltsin's  
stance as another political club with which to flail the president. 
</P>
<P>
	With Yeltsin facing possible impeachment for his policies, the  
communists are attracting growing support from Russians 
disillusioned by years of failed market reforms and the country's 
growing weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, communists are  
spouting Cold War rhetoric that would have seemed laughable just a 
few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NATO aggression against a small, freedom-loving Slav  
nation is a premeditated scare action. Serbia forced to its knees 
would symbolize the triumph of Pax Americana,'' said Communist 
Party leader Gennady Zyuganov. 
</P>
<P>
	Gennady Seleznyov, the communist parliamentary speaker, set off  
alarm bells Friday when he claimed that Yeltsin ordered missiles to 
target NATO countries. But Seleznyov's spokesman later said the two 
men only discussed the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Russians see Yugoslavia as a fellow Slav nation with close  
historic and cultural ties and really do not understand the reasons 
for NATO's actions. While most ordinary people condemn NATO, 
protests at Western embassies have drawn just a few hundred 
communists and nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian media has backed Yugoslavia, with some television  
stations and newspapers using terms like ``barbaric'' and ``evil'' 
to describe NATO strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first two weeks of the conflict, the Russian media paid  
almost no attention to the ethnic Albanian refugees who had fled 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	While TV viewers around the world saw daily reports of refugees  
scrambling for their lives, Russians were watching emotional, 
pro-Belgrade reports of heroic Yugoslavs being blasted by a 
ruthless war machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia, when it comes to the Balkan conflict, is living in a  
virtual world, in which the Albanians, with their burned villages 
and murdered civilians, simply do not exist,'' said commentator 
Andrei Piontkovsky. 
</P>
<P>
	A change came only when some Russian journalists realized that  
Kosovo had become a Russian domestic political issue and they were 
giving support to the communists, who advocate a revival of 
Soviet-style controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Some TV channels and publications began paying attention to the  
refugees. Leading TV anchorman Yevgeny Kiselyov said unbalanced 
coverage of Kosovo could be a threat to Russian democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that the anti-NATO, anti-Western, anti-American  
hysteria could lead to a situation when we would have restored 
Communist Party rule,'' he was quoted as saying by The Moscow 
Times.

<HEADLINE> Health Funds Can't Sue Big Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two union health funds seeking to force the  
tobacco industry to reimburse them for smoking-related injuries to 
their customers cannot proceed with a lawsuit, a federal appeals 
court ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan  
was the second appeals court decision to bar union health funds 
from recovering money from the tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia reached  
the same conclusion March 29 in a lawsuit filed by seven 
Pennsylvania union health funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris lawyer Steven B. Rissman said the two appeals  
court rulings and victories in other courts should help halt a wave 
of health similar lawsuits spawned by a group of contigency-fee 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They bet that the federal courts would disregard established  
law merely because the politically vilified tobacco industry was 
the defendant,'' Rissman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the New York case, the funds for two unions representing  
several thousand workers filed a lawsuit in 1997 to recover money 
they spent on tobacco-related illnesses. Four welfare trust funds 
later joined the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ruled that the health  
funds had proven they deserved reimbursement if a jury found the 
tobacco industry to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court disagreed, saying the union funds were  
essentially suing for damages suffered by their customers, who 
could file lawsuits on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert J. Connerton, a lawyer for the union funds, said he did  
not yet know whether they would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in Kentucky, a tobacco company has unveiled a Web  
site that acknowledges the health risks associated with smoking in 
its strongest language ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. Web site, which debuted  
this week, also offers advice to kick the habit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brown &AMP; Williamson believes that people who choose to smoke  
are taking significant health risks,'' says the Web site for the 
Louisville-based company, maker of Kool and Lucky Strike 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	But tobacco critics dismissed it as a smokescreen intended to  
shield the nation's third-largest tobacco company from future 
liability lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	John Garrison, chief executive officer of the American Lung  
Association, said the Web site was a ``cruel hoax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very clever defensive maneuver to try to make  
themselves less liable as future lawsuits arrive,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rifle Found Near Dead Doctor's Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMHERST, N.Y. (AP) -- A rifle was found buried near the home of  
an abortion doctor who was killed in his kitchen by a sniper's 
bullet last fall, investigators said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The rifle was sent to the FBI laboratory in Washington to  
determine whether it was used to kill Dr. Barnett Slepian. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's not too badly rusted, they may be able to match the  
bullet back to the weapon,'' said Walter Rowe, forensics sciences 
professor at George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullets fired from high-powered rifles can become disfigured and  
provide few clues, but the rifle might yield clothing fibers, 
fingerprints or a serial number that can be traced to the buyer, 
Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said Slepian, 52, was killed by a bullet from a  
high-powered rifle fired through his window from the woods behind 
his home Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests have been made.  
</P>
<P>
	A rifle, buried a foot beneath the ground, was unearthed during  
a search of a heavily wooded, four-acre area Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Due to weather and ground conditions previously in existence  
at the site, this search, although planned early in the 
investigation, was not conducted until this time,'' Amherst police, 
the FBI and state police said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators did not say how close the weapon was to the house.  
</P>
<P>
	Anti-abortion protester James Kopp is being sought as a material  
witness in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Kopp's car was seen in the neighborhood in  
the days before the slaying. Kopp vanished after the shooting, and 
the car was found abandoned at the Newark, N.J., airport in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said DNA test results showed a likelihood that a  
strand of hair discovered behind Slepian's home came from Kopp.

<HEADLINE> Russian: Missiles Targeted at NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's parliament speaker claimed today that  
President Boris Yeltsin has ordered Russian strategic missiles be 
targeted at NATO nations because of airstrikes against Yugoslavia. 
The Kremlin refused to comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament speaker Gennady Seleznyov met Yeltsin today and told  
the Interfax news agency afterward that the president had given the 
order to aim missiles at NATO countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said he could not comment  
on the report. The chief of staff of the Strategic Missile Forces, 
Col. Gen. Anatoly Perminov, said no such order had been received, 
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Seleznyov said he planned to call Yeltsin and find out why their  
discussion about the missiles had not been announced publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Russia had  
no justification for targeting missiles at NATO countries, and 
British diplomats were seeking ``urgent clarification'' from the 
Russian government of the reported threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin himself made no mention of the missiles during remarks  
on Yugoslavia earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the president warned NATO not to send ground troops  
into Yugoslavia and ``make it their protectorate,'' saying such a 
development could prompt a stronger response from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot permit that,'' Yeltsin said in the Kremlin, without  
specifying what action Russia might take. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and the United States have stopped targeting their  
missiles at each other, as they did during the Cold War. The move 
is considered a symbolic step designed to reduce tensions. However, 
the missiles can quickly and easily be re-programmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has said repeatedly that Russia will not be drawn into  
the Yugoslav conflict militarily. But he warned today that NATO 
ground forces could change the equation and require additional 
action on Russia's part. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say it once again, Russia is not going to get  
involved in the conflict unless the Americans push us to that,'' 
Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian hard-liners have been calling on Yeltsin to provide  
military aid to Yugoslavia, which has cultural and religious ties 
to Russia. The president has consistently rejected such calls, but 
he did have harsh words for NATO today. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO ``wants to launch ground operations, it wants to simply  
seize Yugoslavia and make it their protectorate,'' Yeltsin was 
quoted as saying. ``We can by no means give Yugoslavia away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His comments appeared to contradict remarks he made earlier in  
the day, when he said he didn't envision NATO sending ground troops 
into Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO will not ``dare launch a ground operation'' in Kosovo, the  
president was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. ``This 
will mean big losses. The Serbs are prepared to fight to the last 
man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has a long history of making contradictory remarks that  
later must be clarified by his aides. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has sought to find a diplomatic solution to halt the NATO  
airstrikes, but so far its calls have been largely ignored by the 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO says it has no plans to send ground troops into Yugoslavia  
to fight, though it is prepared to have soldiers enforce a peace 
agreement that will grant autonomy to Kosovo, a province of Serbia, 
the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. The deal allows for the return 
of ethnic Albanians who have fled their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin met today in the Kremlin with Seleznyov, who was in  
Belgrade on Thursday for talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav leader requested military aid from Russia,  
Seleznyov said. But Yeltsin reiterated that Russia would not send 
arms to Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Seleznyov said that during his talks with Milosevic on Thursday,  
they discussed the possibility of Yugoslavia joining a Slavic union 
that already includes Russia and Belarus. Milosevic said he 
supported the idea, according to Seleznyov. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Russia-Belarus union remains a largely paper  
agreement that has not produced any visible benefits to either 
nation.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Slip on Inflation Report / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices ended lower Friday after  
surrendering early gains on a report showing that inflation 
remained in check. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/4 point,  
or $2.50 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, rose to 5.46 percent from 5.44 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds had risen in the morning following news that prices  
charged by factories and other producers rose just 0.2 percent in 
March, signalling that inflation, which makes bonds less appealing, 
remains in check for now. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the afternoon, traders moved to lock in the early gains,  
leaving bonds flat to lower. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged and and intermediate maturities were flat to down 
3/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.37 percent as the  
discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 4.26 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.49 percent, as the discount fell 0.02 percentage 
point to 4.33 percent. One-year yields were 4.60 percent as the 
discount fell by 0.01 percentage point from late Thursday to 4.39 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.69 percent from 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 124 3/4 from 124 5/8. The average yield to 
maturity fell to 5.20 percent from 5.21 percent.

<HEADLINE> Official Seeks Chop of Tree Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The city's parks commissioner said today he'll  
ask a judge to chop down the $1,000 fine against a Manhattan dad 
who let his children climb a tree in Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks Commissioner Henry Stern offered to request the fine be  
reduced to $100, but Anthony Avellino still planned to appear in 
court on April 28. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the whole thing is kind of ridiculous. I'd rather not  
pay the $100 at all,'' Avellino said. ``It's not like I 
intentionally sent my kids out to hurt a tree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avellino, a Manhattan restaurant manager, was cited for  
``destruction, defacement or abuse of a tree,'' after his 
daughters, ages 9 and 11, and their 11-year-old friend, were 
spotted climbing a Japanese white pine on March 21. The trees are 
not indigenous to New York and cost several thousand dollars 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the girls broke at least six branches. Avellino  
said only one branch broke. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has made headlines with many of his  
quality-of-life crackdowns, agreed the fine was excessive but said 
rangers were right to ticket Avellino.

<HEADLINE> Walking Augusta With an Echo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Greg Norman walks through this part of the  
world with an echo. 
</P>
<P>
	There is nowhere he goes over the grounds of Augusta National  
where memories do not follow. Memories of drives that slid off the 
fairway, iron shots that would not hold slick greens, wedges that 
spun back off them, putts that behaved as though they had minds of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place,'' Laura Norman said Friday, watching her husband  
play his second shot at No. 14, ``has been a heartbreaker for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The galleries at Augusta know the stories nearly as well as he  
does. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, Norman finished second as Jack Nicklaus staged one of  
the most stirring comebacks in the history of golf. The next year, 
local hero Larry Mize ran in a 140-foot pitch shot to beat Norman 
in a playoff. Nine years after that, Norman beat himself by 
squandering a six-stroke lead on the final day, the golfing 
equivalent of a one-car crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Those episodes explain why, in those moments when they are not  
applauding, that the people tracking Norman's progress sometimes 
use their hands to cover their eyes. Even as he crafted a steady 68 
on this day to move within three strokes of the lead, there was 
reason to do plenty of both. 
</P>
<P>
	When Norman rolled into Amen Corner after a 2-under-par 34 on  
the front and a solid par at No. 10, the wind was still. He missed 
a very makable birdie try at No. 11, eliciting a prolonged groan. 
By the time he stood on the tee at the 155-yard, par-3 12th, the 
wind began rustling the stands of Georgia pines. Carried along on 
its wings was a growing sense of dread. 
</P>
<P>
	At this spot three years ago, Norman's six-stroke lead over Nick  
Faldo had evaporated, and the cold-blooded Englishman threw an 
8-iron into the swirling winds. It stuck in the ribbon of green 
like a dart, daring Norman to follow. The Australian did -- but only 
so far. As his tee shot disappeared into the pond fronting the 
green, with it went any chance of Norman's curing his magnificent 
obsession. 
</P>
<P>
	All that history -- and more -- was poised on the clubhead Friday  
as he pulled a 7-iron away to begin his backswing. Down it came a 
moment later, launching the ball to within 20 feet of the flag, 
from where Norman promptly drained the birdie putt to go 4-under. 
The gallery went wild. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've always been great here, whether it's 1991 or 1999,''  
Norman said. ``I've always had a great rapport and today was no 
different. I think they enjoyed it as much as I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In truth, they might have enjoyed it a little more. Time, a few  
crushing defeats and a few months away from the game while 
rehabilitating from shoulder surgery have made Norman a different 
man. But just as important, it may have made him a different 
golfer. He is more likely to play the safe shot, to let the game 
come to him instead of grabbing it by the throat and shaking it. It 
is easier on everybody's nerves. 
</P>
<P>
	At the par-5 13th, Norman hit a drive that barely reached the  
corner and had to decide whether to go for the green in two. He put 
a 6-iron behind the ball, thinking about laying up, but he liked 
the way it looked so much he went back to the bag for a something 
long enough to knock it on the green. 
</P>
<P>
	His caddie, Tony Navarro, counseled otherwise, won the debate  
and out came the 6-iron. The layup finished short of Rae's Creek, 
and from 71 yards away, Norman sent a sand wedge skidding to within 
6 inches, then tapped in for birdie to get to 5-under. 
</P>
<P>
	Having watched the drama unfold at No. 13, where a safe shot set  
up a spectacular one, fans in the grandstand behind the 14th tee 
showed their appreciation for both by according Norman a standing 
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, someone asked in the interview room, would Norman  
have gone for it with a 4-iron? 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten years ago,'' he replied, ``I would probably have hit a  
5-iron.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, before he was the Shark, before he was a global  
business enterprise, before he raised expectations to a level that 
only his income has so far matched, Norman came here as a raw, 
muscular 26-year-old awed by the surroundings. Everything about the 
place felt right, beginning with the way the golf course was set up 
down to the bags of brand new balata balls they handed him to smack 
out on the practice range. 
</P>
<P>
	And all this happened before he grabbed a share of the  
first-round lead with a 69, went on to finish a surprisingly strong 
fourth, and gave birth to his alter ego, the Great White Shark, by 
revealing in the interview room his passion for hunting the 
predator. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, nearly 20 years later, that inaugural Masters tour stands  
out as both blessing and curse, the echo that follows him all 
around the grounds.

<HEADLINE> More Gasoline Price Hikes Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gasoline will likely cost about a dime a  
gallon more this summer than last because of rising crude oil 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Information Administration said Thursday the average  
price for regular, self-service gasoline will peak at $1.18 a 
gallon in May and average $1.13 a gallon over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The price jump was attributed to an expectation of a continuing  
upward track in crude oil prices because of recent agreement among 
world producers to reduce production. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices also have been affected, especially in California, by  
refinery problems. The average price for regular self-service 
gasoline in California peaked at $1.59 a gallon on April 5, which 
was 49 cents a gallon higher than a year ago, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency predicted that crude oil prices will continue to  
rise, with West Texas intermediate selling at $15.63 per 44-gallon 
barrel on Thursday moving to $18 by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline demand this summer is expected to increase by 2 percent  
over a year ago because of continued economic growth and prices, 
though higher than last year, still moderate by historic standards, 
the agency said. Still, gasoline stocks were high, especially in 
the East, with no supply problems anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Information Administration is the statistical arm of  
the Energy Department.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton, China Premier Meet Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In rejecting U.S. demands that China renounce  
the use of force against Taiwan, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji found 
an improbable ally -- Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	No issue has caused more strains in U.S.-Chinese relations than  
Taiwan and, in his joint news conference with President Clinton on 
Thursday, Zhu said he feared that Taiwan would be in a ``perpetual 
state of separation from the motherland'' if China were to rule out 
the use of force against the anti-communist bastion. 
</P>
<P>
	He then cited as an additional defense of China's position the  
example of Lincoln, whose portrait Zhu had gazed at in the Oval 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu recalled that Lincoln had resorted to force almost 140 years  
ago against secessionist Southerners to maintain the unity of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton drew laughter when he acknowledged that Zhu ``zapped''  
him with that comment. Asserting that the American Civil War and 
the Chinese-Taiwanese split are not analogous, Clinton reaffirmed 
the U.S. view that the Taiwanese issue should be resolved 
peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton added that it would be a good thing for Zhu to visit the  
island ``if the premier is as humorous and clever in Taiwan as he 
is here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu was continuing his official visit today by taking part in a  
forum on the environment and development with Vice President Al 
Gore after meeting with members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the lawmakers scheduled to attend were Rep. David Wu,  
D-Ore., the first Chinese-American member of the House. In a 
statement, Wu said he was ``deeply concerned that the recent 
suppression of political and religious freedom critically 
undermines China's credibility in the international arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The high-level banter between Clinton and Zhu masked how serious  
the Taiwanese issue has been for the two countries. In 1995, 
Clinton enraged China by granting a visa for a U.S. visit by 
Taiwan's president. In early 1996, tensions rose again when the 
United States moved naval forces toward Taiwan in response to 
menacing military moves by China toward Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's exchange with Clinton showed once against that Zhu is  
no mere blue-suited bureaucrat. His 91-minute sparring match with 
Clinton alternated between lighthearted and serious exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	On other issues:  
</P>
<P>
	--Zhu promised Clinton his cooperation in investigations of  
alleged nuclear-weapons spying and illegal campaign contributions 
by Beijing ``no matter who it may involve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--He ridiculed the suggestion of Chinese meddling in U.S.  
politics and rejected U.S. charges of human rights abuses in China 
as ``unfair'' and an intrusion in its internal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton said the two nations disagree ``on the meaning and  
reach of human rights.'' He also said he regretted China's lack of 
progress in opening a dialogue with the Dalai Lama. 
</P>
<P>
	--Both leaders claimed important progress on the contentious  
issue of trade, even though they failed to agree on a 
market-opening deal that would have cleared the way for China's 
entry into the World Trade Organization -- a long-standing Chinese 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton announced a significant expansion of commercial air  
service between the two countries. The number of flights will be 
doubled and additional service will be offered by one new carrier 
from each country.

<HEADLINE> DeBartolo Sued by 49ers, Own Corp. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Eddie DeBartolo's problems in the bayou now  
encompass the boardroom of the San Francisco 49ers and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces a lawsuit filed by the 49ers and his sister -- who's in  
charge because of NFL sanctions against him. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit filed Thursday in San Francisco Superior Court accuses  
the suspended 49ers co-owner of owing the company $94 million and 
stalling a new stadium project. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo's spokesman called the lawsuit a ``sad and desperate  
act'' by Denise DeBartolo York and her husband, John York. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sam Singer, a spokesman for the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.,  
said the lawsuit was not about any personal dispute between 
DeBartolo and his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denise loves her brother very much, but they have vastly  
different business styles,'' Singer said. ``What this really is 
about is this is a corporate lawsuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The corporation and the 49ers have been run by the Yorks since  
DeBartolo became enmeshed 16 months ago in a Louisiana gambling 
fraud scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said it is seeking repayment of the alleged debt,  
cutting DeBartolo's management ties to the team and ending a $10 
million financial interest claimed by DeBartolo in the $525 million 
stadium project. It has been stalled because of soaring 
construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plaintiffs bring this action only after exhausting all  
efforts, spanning two years, to resolve these disputes,'' the suit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL spokeswoman Leslie Hammond said the league did not have any  
immediate comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue sanctioned DeBartolo  
and fined him $1 million, saying he was guilty of conduct 
detrimental to the league for his involvement in the gambling fraud 
case. He also extended DeBartolo's NFL banishment until at least 
February 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue forbade DeBartolo from exercising any authority over  
the 49ers' operations, and DeBartolo agreed not ``to retard or in 
any way impede'' the efforts to get a new stadium, according to the 
suit, which charges that DeBartolo violated that agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue has said DeBartolo would face an additional $4 million  
fine if he violated its terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``As events and the various lawsuits to come will demonstrate,  
Mr. DeBartolo is entitled to control of the 49ers following the 
lifting of his suspension, over $100 million of damages from the 
Yorks, and an immediate equal say in the running of the family 
businesses,'' said spokesman Rick Rice. ``To avoid meeting their 
obligations, the Yorks have breached prior agreements, refused to 
attend shareholder meetings, and rebuffed all overtures at 
restoring family peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said they filed the lawsuit because ``Mrs. York will lose  
control of the board of the Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation at next 
Tuesday's annual meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singer said he had ``no idea'' what the $100 million referred  
to. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the $94 million debt incurred over a decade stemmed from  
DeBartolo's ``lavish personal lifestyle,'' a series of failed 
business attempts, and money owed to investors in other 
partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
	League sources have said that under the sanctions, DeBartolo is  
forbidden from visiting the press box or the team's locker room. 
While he is free to attend games, he isn't allowed to sit in the 
owner's box. 
</P>
<P>
	Another clause includes a total prohibition on gambling, either  
by him personally or as part of his business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo, who pleaded guilty in October to failing to report a  
felony in connection with the gambling fraud case, could be 
reinstated by the league if he satisfies the terms of his 
banishment, Tagliabue has said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo retains the right to discuss some aspects of team  
operations with his sister and John York, now a vice president of 
the 49ers. But any such discussions are to be strictly advisory, 
and the Yorks are free to accept or ignore his advice.

<HEADLINE> Peterson Won't Go to SW Missouri St. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- In hindsight, maybe Bill Rowe should  
have seen it coming: Another basketball coach accepts a job one 
day, declines it the next and leaves his would-be employer 
red-faced with embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	The only concern Rowe, athletic director at Southwest Missouri,  
said he had when he hired Appalachian State's Buzz Peterson as 
basketball coach on Thursday was that Peterson didn't seem to have 
quite the enthusiasm for the job he would have expected. He learned 
why 11 hours later when Peterson called back and said he didn't 
want the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I should have thought about that a little more,'' the  
sheepish Rowe said Friday after becoming the second athletic 
director in less than a month to be embarrassed by a basketball 
coach taking a job one day and turning it down the next. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Harrick announced March 31 he was leaving Rhode Island for  
Georgia, changed his mind and said he was staying, then changed his 
mind again and said he was really going -- all within a period of 30 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, Peterson was a finalist for that Georgia job, but  
Rowe said a key difference here is he won't be given a second 
chance if he changes his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Rowe has reopened the search for a successor to  
Steve Alford, who resigned last month to coach at Iowa after taking 
Southwest Missouri to its first NCAA Sweet 16 appearance in school 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has a couple of people in mind who were candidates  
before Peterson accepted the job. He declined to name them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to hire somebody just to say we've got a head  
basketball coach,'' Rowe said, adding he wouldn't be rushed into a 
decision. ``We're going to get it done the right way, hopefully 
with the right person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He thought he had that person Thursday night when he released a  
statement saying Peterson, 56-30 in three seasons at Appalachian 
State, had been hired. Like Alford four years before, Rowe saw 
Peterson, 35, as another young head coach stepping up to a bigger, 
better program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became apparent to me that our job was a lot better job  
than the one he had there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach, whom Rowe said was encouraged to take the job by such  
basketball luminaries as Michael Jordan, his college roommate, 
visited Springfield on Monday, then asked for time to think things 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, Rowe said, Peterson called him back, thanked  
him for his patience and told him, ``I feel great about it, we're 
coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Rowe got a second call, at 7:30 a.m. Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said he decided he was happy at Appalachian State and,  
ultimately, that was what was most important to him, his wife and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have higher goals to reach here, and I'm looking forward to  
achieving those goals,'' he said, adding he was flattered by 
Southwest Missouri's offer.

<HEADLINE> China Official Explains Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- A shortage of tear gas and rubber bullets forced  
China's military to open fire 10 years ago on demonstrators in 
Tiananmen Square, a former top Communist Party member said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping to the party's official version of the controversial  
1989 melee, Zhu Muzhi said troops were justified in firing on 
``thugs'' who killed soldiers and threw rocks and gas bombs. But he 
acknowledged that ``innocent'' people were also killed in the 
crackdown on democracy advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu suggested that with better anti-riot equipment and more  
experience in dealing with civil unrest, the Chinese government 
might have avoided heavy loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never imagined there would be such an incident, that so  
many thugs would surround and beat the People's Liberation Army,'' 
Zhu, then a member of an advisory commission of party elders, told 
reporters. ``The police at the time had no rubber bullets, no tear 
gas canisters, they had nothing. In the end, the only weapon they 
had at hand was guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the assault, ``many people on the streets who were watching  
the goings-on possibly were hit by flying bullets. They, in fact, 
were innocent,'' said Zhu, who now heads a government-backed 
society for human rights studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds were killed when Chinese troops shot their way through  
Beijing on June 4, 1989, to quell seven weeks of peaceful protests 
in Tiananmen Square calling for democratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the protests were an anti-government  
rebellion that needed to be put down with force. It has never given 
a credible account of the number of dead and injured, or of the 
thousands imprisoned in the wave of arrests that followed. 
</P>
<P>
	With the 10th anniversary of the protest movement drawing near,  
Chinese authorities are particularly nervous about any attempts at 
public commemoration. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness to the crackdown disputed Zhu's claim that police  
lacked riot gear. Robin Munro, formerly with Human Rights Watch, 
said he saw Chinese police with riot shields, helmets and leather 
boots in Beijing after martial law was declared on May 20 -- 16 days 
before the military assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had no justification in sending in the army. Period,'' he  
said. Zhu's claims are ``just an excuse to justify the 
unjustifiable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a luncheon hosted by the Foreign Correspondents'  
Club of China, Zhu recalled seeing ``thugs'' chase a group of 
soldiers during the crackdown and throw one of them off a highway 
overpass. The crowd burned the body, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests ``had evolved into the stage where the people  
wanted to overthrow the government,'' Zhu said. ``I understand why 
at last the PLA soldiers were forced to shoot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under further questioning, Zhu conceded that police did have ``a  
little'' tear gas at their disposal. 
</P>
<P>
	China has beefed up its riot and paramilitary police,  
particularly in Beijing, since the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade of uninterrupted economic growth since 1989 proved the  
crackdown was correct, Zhu claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the handling of June 4 had been totally wrong then these  
past 10 years would have been difficult. China would definitely 
have been in total chaos,'' he said.

	NATO Bombs Oil Depot, Weapons Complex  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO unleashed wide-ranging  
airstrikes against Yugoslavia today that included attacks on an oil 
depot and a weapons complex containing the factory that makes the 
Yugo car, as tensions rose along Yugoslavia's borders with 
neighbors Albania and Macedonia. Yugoslav forces fired heavy 
machine guns at Kosovo Liberation Army fighters in a seven-hour 
clash along Albania's northern frontier, international monitors 
said. And Macedonia said today a Macedonian soldier was killed 
along the border by fire it said came inside Yugoslavia. Pressing 
ahead with his bid to win the freedom of three American soldiers, 
Cypriot Spyros Kyprianou is expected to meet Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic later today.

The Kremlin refused to comment on the report and the chief of staff 
of the Strategic Missile Forces, Col. Gen. Anatoly Perminov, said 
no such order had been received, according to the ITAR-Tass news 
agency. But parliament speaker Gennady Seleznyov said he plans to 
call Yeltsin and find out why their discussion today about the

	'Conceive-A-Thon' for Y2K Baby

in a Boston hotel today, competing to conceive the nation's first 
baby of 2000. Today is considered the optimal conception day for a 
Jan. 1, 2000 birth. If one of the couples bears the first baby born 
in the United States next year, the parents will receive a check 
for $1 million, courtesy of radio station WJMN. Any birth must be 
natural -- no Caesarean sections or inducements allowed. The odds 
against the aspiring parents are long. Obstetricians warn that 
babies arrive when they want over a period of weeks, not seconds.

denied allegations they tried to blackmail a detective into 
granting them an interview about the JonBenet Ramsey slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Globe free-lance writer Jeff Shapiro said the editors  
considered using as leverage a rumor that Detective Steve Thomas' 
mother committed suicide when Thomas was a boy. The rumor later 
proved false. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Lewis, a Globe editor, acknowledged Thursday that he sent  
Thomas photographs of his long-dead mother days after the detective 
resigned from the Ramsey case in frustration. But Lewis denied it 
was an effort to pressure the detective. 
</P>
<P>
	``No employee of the Globe ever said anything like that,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Globe Editor Tony Frost said: ``There was no threat to blackmail  
anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who is writing a book about the case, declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet, 6, was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996, in  
her family's home. The girl's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, have 
come under suspicion. They have denied any involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro said in Thursday's Washington Post that he taped some  
conversations with his editors because he feared some of their 
strategies would jeopardize his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro took the recordings to the FBI, but the detective didn't  
press charges and the agency declined to investigate. Shapiro then 
took them to CBS's ``48 Hours,'' which aired the tapes Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	One tape included an exchange between Shapiro and a Globe editor  
who said, ``I'm not sure that this is even a story for us,'' 
referring to Thomas' family history. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it was something that I thought I might use to get an  
interview with him, you know?'' the editor asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro asked: ``How so?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I'm sure he wouldn't want it published, would he?'' the  
editor replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said he sent the photos to Thomas along with a request for  
an interview because he thought Thomas would find them interesting. 
He said the taped conversations were internal discussions about a 
story on Thomas' life in the wake of his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas resigned Aug. 6, accusing District Attorney Alex Hunter  
of bungling the case and trying to protect JonBenet's parents. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, a grand jury investigating the slaying was granted  
a six-month extension to complete its work. The panel has been 
meeting since mid-September and now can meet until Oct. 20.

<HEADLINE> WNBA Labor Talks To Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- WNBA labor talks will resume Sunday or Monday,  
and commissioner Val Ackerman said she is ``hopeful'' that an 
agreement will be reached at that time on the league's first 
collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time is running out, and we have to have a deal very quickly  
in order to prepare for our season,'' Ackerman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the most contentious issues remain the minimum salary and  
the number of players from the defunct ABL who will be allowed into 
the WNBA. The union is asking for a minimum salary of $45,000, 
while the league's latest offer is $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The league also wants four roster slots open to ex-ABL players  
for each of its teams and six slots for the two expansion teams in 
Orlando and Minnesota. The union wants to limit the number of 
ex-ABL players to two per team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very optimistic that we'll get a deal done because we're  
not that far apart on the issues,'' incoming WBNPA director Pam 
Wheeler said. ``We believe we can get a deal done in no time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sides have already agreed in principle on year-round health  
care coverage, the guaranteeing of contracts after a certain date 
and the creation of an advisory panel to give players input into 
league operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next several days are very important,'' Ackerman said.  
``We have told the union we need an agreement by early- or 
mid-April, and here we are closing in on that time frame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA players are affiliated with the same union as NBA  
players, who were locked out by NBA owners from July through 
mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA is scheduled to open its pre-draft camp next Thursday  
in Chicago, which means a labor agreement would need to be in place 
by Wednesday at the latest in order for the league to start up on 
time for its third season. 
</P>
<P>
	After the pre-draft camp, the next event on the league's  
calendar is the draft April 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Training camps open May 14, and the season is scheduled to start  
June 10.

<HEADLINE> Customs To Study Bias Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Faced with a growing chorus of racial bias  
complaints, the U.S. Customs Service created an independent panel 
Thursday to review the policies and procedures used by inspectors 
looking for airline passengers who might be smuggling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly pledged that the  
commission, composed of officials from other government agencies 
and headed by Smithsonian Institution Undersecretary Constance 
Newman, will have ``unfettered access'' to the agency's records and 
personnel during its three-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a bias exists, whether perceived or real, it is paramount  
that we find its cause and eliminate it,'' Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who asked last month for a formal  
investigation into complaints of racial bias by inspectors at 
Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, called the creation of 
the panel ``an important first step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Something is happening, not just in Atlanta, but in New York  
and Chicago and other parts of the country,'' said Lewis, a veteran 
civil rights leader. ``We need to determine why so many of our 
citizens -- African Americans, Hispanics and others -- are 
complaining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly insisted that racial profiling -- selecting passengers for  
search based on their race -- is not Customs policy, but, ``We want 
to see if in fact, maybe it's developed into a practice that we 
want to stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno, whose Justice Department is  
investigating allegations of racial profiling by three different 
state and local law enforcement agencies, told her weekly news 
conference Thursday: ``We can't duck this issue. I think it's 
important that we confront it and understand it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Customs Service is facing numerous lawsuits over body  
searches, including an effort by almost 100 black women to file a 
class-action suit in Chicago alleging they were singled out because 
of their race and gender. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs officers use strip searches, body cavity searches and  
X-rays to catch smugglers who hide cocaine or heroin inside their 
clothes or swallow packets of the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 50,892 of the 71.5 million international air travelers who  
passed through Customs in 1998 were subjected to some level of body 
search, most of them simple pat-downs, Customs officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those whose race was recorded, almost as many blacks and  
Hispanics as whites were subjected to the more serious strip or 
body cavity searches or sent to hospitals for X-rays. A year 
earlier, 50 percent more blacks and Hispanics were subjected to 
those searches than whites. 
</P>
<P>
	For those subjected to such searches or X-rays, drugs were found  
on 30 percent of blacks; compared to 31 percent the year before; 27 
percent of Hispanics, down from 33 percent; and 19 percent of 
whites, down from 26 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Also named to the commission were Robin Renee Sanders, the  
National Security Council's director for Africa; and Ana Marie 
Salazar, deputy assistant secretary of defense for drug enforcement 
policy and support. Both Sanders, who is black, and Salazar, who is 
Hispanic, said they have had personal experiences with Customs 
officials during border crossings. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford Cloud Jr., president of the National Conference for  
Community and Justice, was named the commission's independent 
advisor.

<HEADLINE> Oil, Wheat Surge Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil rose Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
following a report forecasting that demand will outpace supplies in 
coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, wheat futures fell and coffee rose slightly a  
day after tumbling to 3-year lows. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullish news in oil came from the International Energy  
Agency, which estimated that supplies in the second quarter will 
not meet world demand, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other  
nations were expected to start cutting output this month as part of 
a plan to reduce world supply and boost prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``In practice OPEC is not going to comply with those cuts  
completely,'' Tim Evans, of Pegasus Econometric Group, predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar doubts had caused prices to fall on Wednesday and  
Thursday, giving back gains that came after OPEC and other oil 
producers announced the supply reduction agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're back to a kind of middle range,'' Evans said. ``I would  
expect to see a calmer session Monday'' as market participants 
assess their positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say it may take months to determine whether producers  
are complying with the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Contracts for May delivery of light, sweet crude rose 67 cents  
to $16.50 a barrel; May unleaded gasoline rose 1.18 cent to 50.70 
cents a gallon; May heating oil rose 1.76 cent to 42.60 cents a 
gallon; May natural gas rose 0.46 cent to $2.115 for each 1,000 
cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures fell Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, while  
soybeans and corn rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat spent much of the day sharply lower -- the May contract  
dipped to its lowest level in five weeks -- before a late rally cut 
the losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The selling was spurred by news that while U.S. supplies  
remained stable, world wheat inventories were significantly higher, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also remained under pressure with the harvest approaching  
and crop conditions consistently rated good to excellent. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures rose after the U.S. Agriculture Department  
supply/demand report, which showed a decline in U.S. supplies, 
analysts said. Argentina crop estimates were also slightly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn was higher with continued wet weather in U.S. growing  
regions keeping farmers from the fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery fell 3 cents to $2.65 3/4 a bushel; May corn  
rose 1 1/4 cent to $2.17 3/4 a bushel; May oats were unchanged at $1.16 3/4 
a bushel; May soybeans rose 3 1/4 cents to $4.80 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork futures were mostly higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose 1.43 cent to 65.20 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle rose 0.95 cent to 73.82 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
were up 0.97 cent to 54.72 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose 
0.35 cent to 52.20 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee posted slight gains Friday on the Board of Trade of the  
City of New York after falling sharply a day earlier amid fears 
Colombia will devalue its currency, creating a flood of cheap 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Arabica coffee for May delivery rose 1.25 cent to 98.95 cents a  
pound.

<HEADLINE> US Oil, Gas Rig Count Hits New Low / Oil and Gas Rig Count  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The number of rigs actively exploring for oil and  
natural gas in the United States dropped by five this week to an 
all-time low of 498, the first time it's sunk below 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those that were operating nationwide, 122 were exploring for  
oil and 376 for gas, Houston-based Baker Hughes reported Friday. 
During the same week last year, 889 rigs were operating in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska saw one rig idled in the past week, leaving four still at  
work in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes has kept a rig count since 1944. The tally peaked  
at 4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, during the height of the oil boom, but 
has set record lows in eight of the last 12 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Drilling activity has dropped off due to the steep decline in  
oil and gas prices last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes says there probably are fewer domestic rigs looking  
for oil and gas now than at any time since industry's emerging days 
of the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the other major oil- and gas-producing states, New Mexico and  
Oklahoma gained three rigs each from last week and California 
gained one. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana lost four rigs and Texas lost one, while Wyoming's  
total remained unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan To Lift China Import Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- As China moves closer to entering the  
World Trade Organization, Taiwan said Friday it will lift an import 
ban on 150 agricultural products from mainland China to improve its 
own chances of getting in. 
</P>
<P>
	Once China is admitted into the WTO, Taiwan is expected to  
follow. And Beijing -- as a member of the trade body -- is expected 
to demand more such concessions from Taiwan, which could fuel more 
disputes between the frequently bitter rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Preparing Taiwan to treat China as a fair trading partner under  
WTO rules, Taiwan's Economics Ministry said the island will allow 
the import of Chinese corn, wheat, barley and other farm produce in 
its largest-ever move to open the Taiwanese market for Chinese 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	But completely free trade is out of the question for now. Taiwan  
will keep its ban on several popular teas to prevent hurting the 
livelihood of its own tea growers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan also remained vague on a subject that could prove even  
touchier: Whether to end its ban on air and shipping links with 
China once both are in the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade body's rules would call for open transport links.  
Taiwan conceivably could try to opt out by citing overriding 
national security concerns, but Chiang Ping-kun, chairman of the 
government Council for Economic Planning and Development, said it 
was too soon to say whether Taiwan would try that. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing claims Taiwan a renegade province -- threatening at  
military attack if Taiwan ever formally declares independence -- and 
opposes to its joining any international organizations as a 
sovereign country. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan and China split politically following a civil war in  
1949, and Taiwan bans official contacts with China. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan has completed bilateral negotiations with all 26 WTO  
member countries that demand such talks. A working committee of the 
WTO will convene a multilateral session in Geneva late this month 
or next month to discuss Taiwan's entry. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, both U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese  
Premier Zhu Rongji voiced optimism Thursday that an agreement for 
China joining the WTO can be reached before the end of this year -- 
stirring optimism that Taiwan, too, can become part of the body 
that governs world trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Both China and Taiwan should be in by the end of the year,  
Taiwanese Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang told reporters Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lin Yih-fu, head of the Board of Foreign Trade, said WTO members  
would have no reason to postpone Taiwan's admission further should 
China meet all requirements to be admitted. The Chinese don't 
object to Taiwan being admitted to the WTO -- as long as it is 
classified as a ``customs territory'' instead of as a nation -- but 
they have lobbied fiercely against Taiwan getting in ahead of the 
mainland.

<HEADLINE> Jockey Julie Krone Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The aches and pains from 18 years of riding  
racehorses finally told jockey Julie Krone to call it a career. 
</P>
<P>
	Clambering aboard more than 20,000 horses gave Krone 3,500  
winners, more than $80 million in purses earned and the distinction 
of being the only woman rider to win a Triple Crown race -- the 1993 
Belmont Stakes aboard Colonial Affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked on Thursday about her legacy to the sport, which she  
considers in her blood and in her often-aching bones, Krone 
replied: 
</P>
<P>
	``When some little girl comes up to me beaming and she goes, `I  
play soccer with the boys, and I'm the best scorer and you're my 
hero and I read about you,' those are the times I feel I made a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I made a little girl more brave than she might have been  
and perhaps put a spark under someone who was having a bad day, 
those can be the best moments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krone had plenty of good and bad moments during her career,  
which began with her first winner on Feb. 12, 1981 at Tampa Bay 
Downs and will officially end after her final ride on April 18 at 
Lone Star Park in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a life decision,'' said Krone, thoroughbred racing's  
most successful female rider. ``There's no chance of me riding 
again after April 18.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not even her recent effort at the Fair Grounds in Louisiana,  
where she finished third in the jockey standings with 84 wins, 
including two five-win days, could persuade her otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a constellation of reasons for me to retire,'' Krone  
said during a news conference at Aqueduct Racetrack. ``I'm on top, 
I'm 35 years old, I don't want to get hurt anymore, and I've got 
nothing left to prove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 4-foot-10 1/2, 100 pounds, Krone not only experienced fame and  
fortune, she also gave hope to other females trying to excel in 
sports previously dominated by men. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been an inspiration for not only me, but for every girl  
that came along,'' jockey Diane Nelson said. ``I can remember a 
change happening, when you had big outfits, and the nice horses, 
and people would take a chance on a girl. It wasn't an oddity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krone, married since 1995 to Matt Muzikar, said there are no  
definite plans for the future, adding she has ``many options.'' 
Among those are working in television -- ``I'd love to be able to 
work in TV during Derby week'' -- dabbling in art and photography 
and continuing her education toward a psychology degree. 
</P>
<P>
	She may have ridden well at the Fair Grounds, but the injuries  
proved too much to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like this Olympic runner I read about (who set three  
world records the summer she decided to quit),'' Krone said. ``I'd 
go to sleep at night, and my ankle hurt and my knee hurt and I'd 
think, `I just want to get this over with.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Krone began her run of success in 1987, five years after winning  
her first riding title at Atlantic City. She became the first 
female to win riding titles at major tracks such as Monmouth Park 
and the Meadowlands in New Jersey. In 1989, she was the nation's 
third-leading rider with 368 winners. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1991, she was a regular on the New York circuit and a year  
later won a career-best $9.1 million in purses. In '92 and '93, 
Krone won riding titles at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 20, 1993, she became the third jockey to win five races  
in a day at Saratoga. Angel Cordero Jr. and Ron Turcotte were the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	But 10 days later, Krone went down in a spill and severely  
fractured her right ankle, which required two plates and 14 screws 
to reconstruct. Nine months later, she was riding again. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 13, 1995, she was thrown from her horse again, this time  
at Gulfstream. Krone broke both hands, but never regained her top 
form until recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, Krone broke her right knee at the Meadowlands.  
She won the race, then added two more winners before the fracture 
was diagnosed a day later. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone was back racing three months later, and on Feb. 16 she  
posted her 3,500th victory, guiding May B A Walk to a win at the 
Fair Grounds. She celebrated with a backward handspring. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a student of the game and a student of horses,'' Hall  
of Fame trainer Allen Jerkens said. ``She was interested in the 
training part, too. She worked hard in the mornings and she worked 
hard in the afternoon. ... For her to win 3,500 is remarkable.''

another string of records yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's session was the second time this week that the Dow,  
the Nasdaq and the S&AMP;P all hit new highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices initially headed higher, after a report showing  
benign inflation once again in March. 
</P>
<P>
	But Treasury prices have since given up some of their earlier  
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street won't get much direction from the corporate sector,  
with no big earnings reports scheduled until next week.

<HEADLINE> Study Cites Bacteria at Beaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Waters along 95 percent of the  
Southern California and Mexico coastline met health standards, 
although beaches near storm drains, rivers and creeks can have 
unhealthy bacteria levels, a study released today found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, an unprecedented cooperative effort by 36  
organizations including government agencies, environmental groups 
and volunteers, looked at shores from Point Conception south to 
Punta Banda, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, conducted for five weeks starting last August, was  
released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the State 
Water Resources Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority of the coastline looks pretty good, and that is  
one of our main conclusions,'' said Rachel Noble, lead scientist 
for the study by the Southern California Coastal Water Research 
Project. 
</P>
<P>
	Sites up and down 690 miles of coastal waters were tested for  
two kinds of bacteria that indicate contamination by human sewage 
or animal waste. Such contamination can cause diarrhea, respiratory 
infections or other problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-week study that began Aug. 2 concluded that water  
quality was poorest near outlets for urban storm and sewage runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, only 5 percent of the shoreline exceeded California's  
daily or monthly limits for at least one of the four bacterial 
tests conducted. But of the samples taken from the mouths of storm 
drains, rivers and other runoff sources, 40 percent failed the 
daily limits and 60 percent failed the monthly standard. 
</P>
<P>
	The water quality there was ``consistently poor,'' the study  
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The study of five Southern California counties and northern Baja  
California in Mexico involved 22 government agencies and nearly two 
dozen environmental groups. Teams took weekly samples at 307 sites 
from Point Conception, north of Santa Barbara, to Ensenada, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first study to offer a regional picture of coastal  
waters. About two dozen different agencies collect about 80,000 
water samples each year, but their testing methods vary.

<HEADLINE> Donen Directs TV's `Love Letters' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Early in the film ``Love Letters,'' schoolboy  
Andy Ladd falls in love. 
</P>
<P>
	As he recites the Pledge of Allegiance with his second-grade  
class, into the room walks a new pupil, Melissa Gardner. Andy's jaw 
drops in mid-sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus begins two lovers' lifetime of mutual devotion and  
insurmountable obstacles -- and it's all on the record, albeit 
sometimes between the lines, in the letters they exchange. A 
bittersweet romance based on the popular A.R. Gurney play, ``Love 
Letters'' stars Steven Weber (``Wings,'' TV's ``The Shining'') and 
a luminous Laura Linney (``The Truman Show''). It airs Monday at 9 
p.m. EDT on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's directed by show-business legend Stanley Donen, who  
almost 70 years ago was similarly swept off his feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back in Columbia, S.C., I was the one walking into the  
schoolroom,'' he says, a bit dreamy-eyed at the memory. ``I was not 
quite six years old, and I saw this little girl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can still remember the feeling of elation. I fell in love at  
that instant, and I was mad for her, for two or three years. She's 
probably dead by now, but I remember her as a gorgeous angel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That sort of willing heart has propelled Donen (pronounced  
DAH-nan) through his career, first as a groundbreaking 
choreographer, then as the director of such classic films as ``On 
The Town,'' ``Singin' in the Rain,'' ``Charade'' and ``Two for the 
Road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Presenting him with a lifetime achievement Oscar a year ago,  
director Martin Scorsese hailed Donen's films for their ``elegance, 
wit, visual innovation and extraordinary grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, at long last in possession of what he called ``this cute  
little fella,'' Donen danced cheek-to-cheek with his statuette as 
he crooned, ``Heaven, I'm in heaven.'' It brought down the house. 
</P>
<P>
	But until ``Love Letters,'' Donen, who turns 75 on Tuesday,  
hadn't made a film since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been very busy,'' he insists. ``I must have prepared at  
least 10 movies that didn't get made, for one reason or another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, he signed to make ``Love Letters'' as a movie, relishing  
the challenge of bringing it to the big screen. The play calls for 
actor and actress to sit side by side as Andy and Melissa, each 
reading correspondence received from the other. ``To take that and 
make it into a movie -- a whole different approach!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film script broadened the story's scope to global  
proportions. Then the studio lost interest. But ABC stepped in. To 
oblige TV's smaller budget and smaller screen, Gurney fashioned yet 
another adaptation. 
</P>
<P>
	In what became his TV directorial debut, Donen shot the film in  
Toronto -- ``I forget which day. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are limits to TV,'' says Donen, who actually had a scant  
17 days, ``and that's what was fun: to try to find a way to be 
surprising within limits. I'm always looking for limits, because 
then you have to be inventive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he talks, he relaxes in his memento-filled apartment high  
above Lincoln Center. Oscar has a place of honor on the piano. On 
the couch is a pillow from his wife (his fifth wife) years before 
their amicable split, embroidered: EAT DRINK AND RE-MARRY. 
</P>
<P>
	A stack of scripts rests by his feet on the ottoman. But who  
knows if cameras will ever roll on any of them? Not Donen, after 
those 15 years of abortive projects. And who would have blamed him 
for back-to-work butterflies when he first called out ``Action!'' 
on ``Love Letters''? 
</P>
<P>
	But there were no special jitters. ``In the beginning, I always  
feel lost,'' he says in his mildly fretful manner. ``But if you're 
frightened, you'll be lousy. So you can't be frightened. You've got 
to just be relaxed, like there's no problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just go on my feelings: What do I feel is good?''  
</P>
<P>
	But after directing superstars like Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire and  
Frank Sinatra, Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, he has lots of 
experience to supplement those feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's best if you even forget your experience,'' Donen says,  
``because you don't want to fall back on something you've already 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What he was saying recalled his Oscar acceptance speech: ``...  
and when filming starts, you show up and you stay the hell out of 
the way. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donen smiles plaintively. ``Laura Linney is a wonderful actor,  
but I can't take credit for that. Perhaps I helped her a bit. I 
hope I did. But I don't know how to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just go along. Do the best I can. In our lives, a lot of it  
is chance. Making a movie is like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chance? In a job more often likened to a general in battle, is  
that what directing for Donen comes down to? 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, maybe you say yes or no sometime,'' he allows. ``But  
gently.'' 
</P>

	`Z GAMES': Disney Channel's new reality sports show, ``Z  
Games,'' captures games from the playgrounds, homes and backyards 
where they originate. There are no scripts, just children and an 
idea for a nontraditional sport. The first half-hour features 
``Target,'' a game created by 12-year-old Taylor of Vero Beach, 
Fla., which involves taking grapefruits that fell from trees in his 
grandmother's backyard and catapulting them with a shovel. And in a 
regular segment called ``Z Lab,'' kids create ``Z Game'' within a 
limited amount of time, right before the audience's eyes. ``Z 
Games'' premieres Sunday at 5:05 p.m. EDT.

<HEADLINE> Doc Calls Lindros Surgery a Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros was breathing easier following  
surgery today to remove a blood clot from his chest cavity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Flyers' star center underwent the 90-minute  
procedure after a setback in his recovery from a collapsed lung. 
Doctors at the University of Pennsylvania called the procedure a 
success and said Lindros should make a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in some pain right now but he's feeling pretty good,''  
said Dr. Larry Kaiser, a chest surgeon who performed the operation. 
``He's glad it's over and looks forward to being out of here in a 
few days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A whirlwind day that began with Lindros being released from a  
hospital in Nashville, Tenn., turned somber when Kaiser said 
Thursday night that the prolific scorer and team captain had run a 
fever in excess of 102 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser removed a hardened blood clot that was pressing against  
the lower lobe of Lindros' right lung, keeping it from fully 
expanding. The fluid in the lung was not infected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found exactly what we thought we would find,'' Kaiser said.  
``We were able to totally remove it and his lung is now completely 
re-expanded ... I think he'll find his breathing is significantly 
better, easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure, called video thoroscopy, was minor, and Lindros  
is expected to be hospitalized four to five days at Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers, who beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 3-1 Thursday night  
as Lindros was readmitted to the hospital, are preparing for a 
playoff run without him. For now, it's almost impossible to stop 
thinking about the heart and soul of their team. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the sportscast this morning, we were all basically  
listening to his every word because nobody's talked to him,'' said 
goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck, who stopped 16 shots including three 
brilliant saves in the third period. ``He's had a lot of stuff 
happen to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were just all taking it in and focusing on this game. It  
was a big two points for us, and I'm sure he's happy about that. 
But most of all, we're happy that he's back around here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers, who got John LeClair, Mark Recchi and Eric  
Desjardins back from injuries, moved past the Penguins to take over 
fifth place in the Eastern Conference with four games left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins lost their third straight to increase their  
season-high winless streak to eight games (0-6-2). It was their 
10th consecutive loss in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros showed no signs of additional bleeding, Kaiser said  
Thursday. Lindros canceled plans to come to the arena and meet with 
teammates before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you could say he was very disappointed,'' Kaiser said.  
``He was under the impression that this was behind him and he was 
on his way home. I think he dislikes being in the hospital. He was 
clearly disappointed, but he understands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser said the operation involved inserting a tube and a  
microscopic camera through small incisions in Lindros' chest. The 
material and clotted blood was not in the lung, but in the area 
between the lung and the diaphragm. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors don't know for sure what caused about six pints of blood  
to seep into Lindros' chest after a 2-1 victory over the Nashville 
Predators last Thursday. Kaiser said the blood likely seeped from 
his lung, adding that he found no evidence that a blood vessel had 
ruptured. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros was pale and coughing intermittently during a brief news  
conference before being released from Baptist Hospital Thursday and 
flying home to Philadelphia. He said he was ``getting better every 
day,'' but understood the seriousness of his injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't worry about the next game,'' he said. ``You don't  
worry about the first round. You wonder what's going to happen in 
the next hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have said Lindros needs three to four weeks to  
regenerate the blood he lost. He continues to insist on not having 
a transfusion, and Kaiser is following those instructions. The 
playoffs begin April 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst-case scenario is I don't come back until  
September,'' Lindros said. ``But I think because of the jump-start 
we had here and the good care here, I might be on my way back much 
sooner than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers aren't counting on it.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's not our main concern, getting Eric back,'' said  
LeClair, who tied Lindros for the team lead with his 40th goal. 
``Our main concern is getting Eric healthy.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Fear Harm From Side Air Bags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are concerned that side air  
bags in autos' rear seats could seriously injure children riding 
too close to a door, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Side air bags in the rear seats of Mercedes-Benz, Audi and BMW  
cars could deploy with enough power to severely harm children 
resting near the door, said Transportation Department officials, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The concerns were based either on test results the automakers  
shared with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or 
independent testing done by that agency's engineers using a dummy 
representing a 3-year-old sleeping against the door, among other 
positions, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no reports of children killed or seriously  
injured by side air bags, which have the potential to save lives in 
side-impact crashes, NHTSA say. 
</P>
<P>
	But federal regulators want to take all steps possible to  
prevent problems with side air bags in light of the public outcry 
over deaths from air bags deploying from the front of autos. Those 
air bags have been blamed for killing 131 people, including 73 
children, government statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators have talked to nine automakers about side air  
bag testing. NHTSA's chief, Dr. Ricardo Martinez, urged 
manufacturers last December to ``thoroughly test'' side air bags 
``to guard against the risk of injury'' to children riding close to 
the safety devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators met again last month with Mercedes, Audi and  
BMW, the only three manufacturers thus far offering side air bags 
as an option in the rear seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Audi, BMW and Mercedes said they shared their side air bag test  
data with federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Company tests with dummies representing 3-year-olds resting on  
the door of an Audi and a BMW indicated those children could be 
injured, and the carmakers have issued warnings to customers, 
company spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of the results pointed to a risk of injury to occupants  
except under conditions simulating a worst-case, unrestrained (by a 
child seat) and out of position 3-year-old dummy,'' said Audi 
spokesman Doug Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW spokesman Rob Mitchell said a test positioning a 3-year-old  
dummy against the door as if asleep showed ``a concern for 
potential injury'' to a child's head and neck. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mercedes spokeswoman Donna Boland said her company's testing  
showed no serious injuries to children from side air bags. In the 
absence of a government testing standard for the devices, she said, 
``all we can do is our testing, which is rigorous, and watch what's 
happening out there in the real world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, NHTSA's own tests of a Mercedes side air bag indicated  
a child sleeping against the door risks injuries, one government 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Audi is warning consumers in the owner's manual and with a label  
affixed to the back door. The manual says: ``A child must never 
rest his/her head against the side trim panel in the area where the 
side air bag inflates. An inflating air bag can cause serious or 
fatal injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BMW has similar warnings in the owner's manual, a safety card in  
the glove box and stickers. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW is starting to ship to its showrooms cars with side air bags  
that are turned off in the rear seat. Consumers who want them 
activated must request it. Until now, they were arriving in 
showrooms turned on and customers had the option of turning them 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because it's such a concern, we're reversing the process,''  
Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the agency testing are scheduled for release  
April 19. Agency officials would like the industry to devise 
voluntarily a common approach to testing side air bags to ensure 
the risks to children are minimal.

<HEADLINE> GM May Build Assembly Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- General Motors Corp. could break ground as  
early as this fall on an assembly plant in Lansing if the automaker 
gets necessary approvals and ultimately decides such a project 
should go forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant would be the first new assembly plant built by GM  
since the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., opened in 1990. It 
would also be the first new GM plant built in Michigan since the 
Detroit Hamtramck factory opened in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	GM will have to undergo negotiations with the United Auto  
Workers over rules and employment levels, as well as get approval 
for the proposal from GM's board of directors and pin down such 
issues as tax incentives, GM spokesman Kyle Johnson said today. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the required preliminary legal work, the automaker  
has applied for an air-quality permit from the state for the 
possible new plant in Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of caveats attached there,'' he said.  
``Nothing has been approved. There's a lot that needs to happen 
prior to really stating that we've got a `go' program here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit News reported in today's editions that the project's  
price tag is $350 million and that the plant would make future 
Cadillacs. The Detroit Free Press reported that GM wants to build 
the plant to make a replacement for the Cadillac Catera and 
similar-sized cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he could not confirm the plant's estimated cost or  
the possible product line. 
</P>
<P>
	Both plants will employ, to varying degrees, what GM calls  
``modular assembly'' practices that rely on outside suppliers to 
provide large sections of the cars already preassembled to the 
factory. 
</P>
<P>
	Top UAW officials are wary of the practice, fearing reduced jobs  
inside the proposed plants. GM also is proposing that the two 
plants run as efficiently as possible -- meaning few UAW workers 
would be used in nonproduction jobs such as cutting grass, 
painting, and operating cafeterias.

<HEADLINE> Ten Plead Guilty in Bird Slaughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Ten men -- three Lake Ontario fishing  
guides and seven avid anglers -- pleaded guilty in the slaughter of 
as many as 2,000 cormorants, a federally protected bird with a 
voracious appetite for fish. 
</P>
<P>
	In federal court Thursday, nine of the men admitted shooting the  
birds last summer. The 10th man admitted hiding the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Sport fishermen and guides on eastern Lake Ontario have long  
complained that the cormorants are ruining the fishing and 
threatening their livelihoods. 
</P>
<P>
	The birds were shot on Little Galloo Island, an uninhabited 52  
acres five miles offshore that is the cormorant's principal colony 
in eastern Lake Ontario, with an estimated 7,500 nesting pairs. 
Hundreds of the birds were wounded and left to die; many of the 
hatchlings were left to starve to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no excuse for the inhumane way in which these birds  
were slaughtered and left to die,'' said Ron Lambertson, regional 
director for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants could get up to six months of home confinement  
and fines of up to $2,500 at sentencing Aug. 11. They will also 
have to donate collectively a tax-deductible $27,500 to the 
National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The double-crested cormorant is protected under the Migratory  
Bird Treaty Act. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, a state study reported that the cormorant consumed  
an estimated 87.5 million fish from eastern Lake Ontario in 1998, 
including 1.3 million smallmouth bass, the lake's most popular 
sport species. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, state officials unveiled a plan to reduce the Little  
Galloo colony to 1,500 nests within five years by killing adult 
birds and spraying eggs with oil to suffocate the embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	But the defendants couldn't wait and instead ``acted as  
vigilantes,'' said John Cahill, state commissioner of environmental 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney James McGraw said his clients, Ronald Ditch and  
his three sons, were pushed to extreme measures by the state's 
inaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditch has been a fishing guide on the lake for more than 30  
years and saw the birds ``cutting into his livelihood, ruining the 
health of the lake and destroying the local economy,'' the attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They waited and waited and waited and watched the destruction  
of the fishery. Finally, they did something about it,'' McGraw 
said.

<HEADLINE> Woman's Death Ends Life of Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A life of abuse at the hands of her husband ended  
for an Atlanta woman after he poured gasoline on her and set her on 
fire, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, William Reese died in an explosion when he pulled  
out a natural gas line, apparently to make it appear her death was 
accidental, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said Rosemary Flournoy, 41, sometimes sought refuge  
from domestic fights by sitting on the front porch of her 
apartment. That's what she was doing early Thursday when Reese, 45, 
set her afire, homicide Sgt. Keith Meadows said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese then went back into the apartment and yanked loose the gas  
line. The resulting explosion killed him and blew out a chunk of 
wall in the four-unit apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Flournoy died about 10 hours later at Grady Memorial  
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``She took a lot off him,'' said a neighbor, Rebecca Murphy, 30.  
``People say when you take a lot of abuse, you love them. I don't 
see how.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reese had a history of arrests, but most of the charges,  
including a 1993 murder charge, were dismissed. The stiffest 
penalty he got was probation and a $350 fine for a 1981 larceny. 
</P>
<P>
	In one 1997 case, police said Reese tied his wife to their bed  
with an electrical extension cord. She eventually got free and 
crawled out a window and ran to a nearby police precinct. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese was jailed for a few months, but Ms. Flournoy later asked  
a judge to dismiss the case because she was having financial 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just can't hardly make it without my husband,'' Ms. Flournoy  
wrote. ``Would you please have some mercy on him, your honor.''

<HEADLINE> Six Dead in Midwest, Plains Storms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A tornado with 200-mph winds demolished about  
200 houses in two Cincinnati suburbs before daybreak today, killing 
four people and leaving normally manicured yards littered with 
bricks, broken two-by-fours and tattered roofs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other people were killed in Illinois as powerful storms tore  
through the Midwest overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Cincinnati suburbs of Montgomery and Blue Ash, water  
spewed into the air from broken fire hydrants and shopping center 
parking lots were strewn with broken glass. Sheet metal that had 
been siding was wrapped around utility poles. Stately pines and 
thick sycamore and maple trees were yanked out by the roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsey Stiffler, 13, was asleep in her bedroom with the window  
open in Montgomery when she heard rain and hail and then a roaring 
noise. She looked out, saw the storm, and fled to the basement with 
her family. 
</P>
<P>
	When they emerged, the back portion of her neighbor's wooden  
house was split in two, with one side leaning over, she said. 
Elsewhere on her street, ``there were mattresses and curtains and 
everything sticking out of the windows,'' she said. ``Roofs were 
ripped off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie McGill, 13, her friend from down the street, told of a  
similar experience: ``I could hear everything flying through the 
house, smashing around. I didn't realize what was going on until I 
got outside. There was glass on the ground. The carport was lying 
against the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were killed in a house, and two in separate car  
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the victims, a 40-year-old man, was thrown from his car  
when the wind flipped it over, Blue Ash Police Chief Mike Allen 
said. The same gust flipped a tractor-trailer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio's Emergency Management Agency estimated 200 homes were  
destroyed and 400 damaged in Cincinnati's northeastern suburbs 
alone. The utility Cinergy said about 200,000 customers lost power. 
Most service had been restored by the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm also flipped motor homes and campers that convert to  
tents at the Dave Arbogast dealership in Tipp City, north of 
Dayton. ``We got about 10 tent campers in a nice, neat pile,'' said 
Ron West, a manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bob Taft said officials had no estimate of damage. He  
declared three counties emergency areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw homes where walls were torn down and chairs, tables and  
computers were sitting there untouched,'' he said. ``It's a total 
rebuilding effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Ashland, Ill., a community of 1,200, a tornado ripped into a  
trailer park and killed a 68-year-old woman. And a 43-year-old 
woman was killed in a mobile home in Cisco, 65 miles to the east. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms also damaged homes in Indiana. In Iowa, at least nine  
suspected tornadoes destroyed homes, flattened barns and uprooted 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
	A hay baler and other farm equipment were overturned on Deb  
Frisbie's farm near Adair, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``We barely made it to the basement,'' she said. ``We didn't  
really hear anything. All I was worried about was getting everybody 
to the basement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado also ravaged a five-block area in the Nebraska town of  
North Bend on Thursday afternoon, and the storm damaged buildings 
and downed power lines in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was napping,'' said Margaret Linville, whose barn was  
destroyed in Barnard, Mo. ``When I roused, the barn was gone, 
debris was still flying.''

<HEADLINE> How Computerized GRE Test Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Graduate Record Examination will be given  
solely on computer after tomorrow. The Graduate Management 
Admissions Test already is given only by computer, and the Test of 
English as a Foreign Language is often given by computer in most 
parts of the world. The SAT is still given mostly on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	How such a computer-adaptive standardized test works:  
</P>
<P>
	A pre-test computer tutorial shows test-takers how -- using a  
computer mouse -- they can answer a question, and how to move to the 
next question. 
</P>
<P>
	The test begins with questions of moderate difficulty. As the  
test-taker answers each question, the computer scores the question 
and uses that information, as well as responses to previous 
questions, to determine which question to present next. 
</P>
<P>
	With each correct response, the computer typically selects a  
next question of greater difficulty. In contrast, if the test-taker 
answers a question incorrectly, the next question the computer 
selects is less difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	That means different test-takers will be given different, but  
comparable, questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Test-takers must answer each question when it is presented,  
cannot skip questions and cannot return to a question that's 
already been answered. 
</P>
<P>
	If a test-taker answers a question incorrectly due to a careless  
error, for example, the test-taker still has the opportunity to 
receive more difficult questions if he answers subsequent questions 
correctly. 
</P>
<P>
	When scoring the test, the computer takes into account the  
difficulty of the questions answered. If two test-takers have the 
same number of correct responses, generally the person who answers 
more of the difficult questions correctly will receive the higher 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	Test-takers can choose to either cancel the test results, or see  
their unofficial scores (except essay scores), immediately on the 
computer screen after the test. 
</P>
<P>
	The official test score, with essays scored by people, is mailed  
to the test-taker 10 to 15 days after the test date. The score is 
mailed to colleges within about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	If a test-taker chooses to cancel a score, it cannot later be  
reinstated, and the company makes no refund.

<HEADLINE> Before Buying Home, Check Credit / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For most people, home buying requires close  
scrutiny of the building structure, the neighborhood, school 
system, even the local shopping scene. Then there's the task of 
finding the right mortgage lender. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's one area often overlooked in the process: the  
condition of one's credit report. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit history is a key component in buying a home. Mortgage  
lenders closely review borrowers' credit reports to determine 
whether they are a good lending risk based on past performances. 
Any problems, like late payments or delinquencies, can delay or 
even thwart a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst thing anyone can do is to fall in love with a house  
and not be able to qualify for a loan to buy it,'' said Steve 
Rhode, president and cofounder of Washington-based Debt Counselors 
of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Frances B. Smith, executive director of the consumer advocacy  
group Consumer Alert in Washington, agreed, noting the 
competitiveness for buyers in many parts of the country these days. 
``In today's real estate market, people are snapping up houses and 
they're putting in offers at open houses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry experts strongly urge home buyers to order up their  
credit reports and carefully review them prior to looking at homes, 
especially now as the peak home-selling gets under way. Even if you 
think your credit history is spotless, sometimes reports contain 
errors that take time to correct or discrepancies that need to be 
set straight. (That usually involves writing the credit bureau.) 
</P>
<P>
	``In today's world we hear of so many cases of identity theft  
... with people stealing credit cards and opening accounts in your 
name without authorization. All sorts of scams take place,'' said 
Smith, who recommends individuals routinely review their credit 
reports annually. ``People should know that they have a credit 
report that will stand scrutiny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three main credit reporting agencies -- Equifax,  
1-800-685-1111 (www.equifax.com), Experian, 1-888-397-3742 
(www.experian.com), and Trans Union, 1-800-888-4213 
(www.transunion.com) -- provide reports for a nominal fee, or in 
some instances free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also services that consolidate all three reports into  
one comprehensive document. One of them, Right to Know, 
1-800-993-3600 (www.righttoknow.com), a product of NIB Ltd. of 
Princeton Junction, N.J., costs $29.95 for a basic package. 
</P>
<P>
	In making loan decisions, mortgage lenders closely review  
applicants' credit reports for borrowing and repayment patterns. 
Most use a highly sophisticated credit scoring system known as 
``FICO,'' devised by Fair, Isaac &AMP; Co., (www.fairisaac.com) based 
in San Rafael, Calif. The firm recently expanded its Web site to 
include information for consumers looking to improve their credit 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Being late on a credit card payment or other obligation will  
mean points against you. A history of late payments or delinquent 
accounts is generally regarded as a red flag and decreases the 
likelihood of getting a loan approved, or else one with the most 
favorable terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your score will often determine your interest rate, the points  
you have to pay, what down payment is required ...,'' said Rhode. 
</P>
<P>
	Building and maintaining good credit, he said, simply means  
improving your credit profile -- paying bills on time each month, 
paying off outstanding debt, limiting the amount of credit you use, 
consolidating loans. Credit scores will improve over time through a 
pattern of positive credit use, according to Fair, Isaac. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit report, though, is only one of many pieces of data  
lenders use in determining credit risk, noted Brian Hershkowitz, 
president of LandSafe Credit Inc., a subsidiary of Countrywide 
Credit Industries in Calabasas, Calif. He says lenders rely on the 
``Three Cs'': Character, or the ability to pay bills in the face of 
difficulties; Capacity, or the income and assets available for 
paying the bills; and Collateral, or what will be put up to secure 
the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lender wants to see how you handle problems. Do you handle  
principal housing expenses first? ... That shows a certain 
character,'' said Hershkowitz. 
</P>
<P>
	He says those with the highest credit rating usually score in  
the 800 range, while the lowest are in the 400s. Most individuals 
fall in the high 600- to low 700 range, he said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Down 35.80 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Friday morning, as traders  
paused to take profits from this week's record-setting performance 
and investors kept an eye on strife in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 35.80 at 10,161.90. The average of 30 blue-chip stocks closed 
Thursday at a record 10,197.70 and is up 365.19 since last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 4.77 to  
2,578.16, adding to Thursday's record. But the Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500-stock index slipped from its record close and was down 1.42 to 
1,342.56. 
</P>
<P>
	The three major stock market gauges reached new heights Thursday  
after a larger-than-expected cut in European interest rates spurred 
hopes for a recovery in the global economy. The Dow is up 11 
percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking a breather after a run to new highs,'' said Tony  
Cecin, director of equity trading at Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. 
He said traders were monitoring NATO's air attacks on Yugoslavia, 
but said the tensions in that region so far have had limited effect 
on stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Helping equities, the Labor Department said today that prices  
paid to producers such as factories and refineries rose a 
milder-than-expected 0.2 percent in March, suggesting inflation 
remains in check. With inflation mild, the Federal Reserve is 
unlikely to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The news today confirms that the American economy has found a  
vaccination for the inflation bug in the form of higher 
productivity and international competition,'' said David Huether, 
an analyst at the National Association of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report on wholesale prices also noted that crude oil  
rose 29 percent in March, the biggest increase since the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite higher fuel costs, Airline stocks advanced on the New  
York Stock Exchange, with Delta Airlines up 3 7/16 to 70 3/4 and UAL 
Corp. rising 3 5/16 to 80 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the Dow lower was Union Carbide, off 1 13/16 to 49 9/16,  
after Morgan Stanley cut its rating of the chemical company. 
Analysts have dismissed takeover rumors involving the company. 
Another Dow component, United Technologies, was down 1 7/8 to 131 
15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were continuing their upward march. America  
Online was up 1 7/16 to 161 15/16 on the New York Stock Exchange 
and online auction company eBay was up 11 1/4 to 183 in Nasdaq 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the Nasdaq, theglobe.com soared 22 1/2 to 81 1/2. The Internet  
service provider announced a 2-for-1 stock split late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the  
NYSE, where volume came to 327.1 million shares at midday, down 
from Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 0.43 to 623.85, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.36 to 724.29. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.5 percent. In  
Europe, Germany's DAX index was up 1.6 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 
was up 0.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 1.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Down 23.86 at 10,173.84 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The record-setting pace on Wall Street continued  
on Friday, with a rally in technology stocks sending the Nasdaq and 
Standard &AMP; Poor's indexes to record highs for the fourth time this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials, however, faltered for the first time in two  
days as traders paused to take profits on blue-chip stocks before 
the start of the quarterly flood of earnings reports from Corporate 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 23.86 at 10,173.84 on  
Friday. The average of 30 blue-chip stocks soared to record levels 
three times earlier this week, including on Thursday, when it 
closed at 10,197.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Friday's decline, the Dow rose 341.33 for the week and  
has climbed nearly 11 percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index added to Thursday's record with its  
19.66-point climb to 2,593.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Also vaulting to a new high for the fourth time this week was  
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, rising 4.37 to 1,348.35. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the Internet stocks leading today,'' said Larry  
Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dow was just taking a breather,'' he said. ``But when you  
think about what went on this week, taking a breather isn't so 
bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helping the market was a new Labor Department report that showed

Continental Airlines' announcement that it raised its fares. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental rose 3 1/16 at 40 7/8, Delta Airlines rose 4 1/4 to 71  
9/16 and UAL Corp. rose 1 7/8 to 78 15/16.

chat site that went public on Friday. The stock was priced at $22 
and rose to 57 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The market's latest surge came after traders shook off a bout of  
worries about the strength of upcoming earnings reports. But there 
was a fresh warning from Compaq Computer Corp., which said after 
the close of trading that it expected to report earnings well below 
analysts' expectations. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Illinois St. Names Richardson Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORMAL, Ill. (AP) -- Illinois State hired Tom Richardson, an  
assistant for six years, as coach of the men's basketball program 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first college coaching job for Richardson, who  
was selected eight days after the man who hired him an as 
assistant, Kevin Stallings, left Illinois State for Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was committed to finding the best coach for our program,''  
athletic director Rick Greenspan said. ``It became clear to me that 
the selection of Tom Richardson isn't right because it's easy. It's 
easy because it is right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stallings hired Richardson, a 44-year-old Chicago native, from  
Nazareth Academy High School in LaGrange, Ill., after meeting him 
on recruiting trips. 
</P>
<P>
	With Richardson as an assistant, Stallings led the Redbirds to a  
123-63 record over the last six years, including trips to the NCAA 
tournament in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll continue to see a very aggressive style of  
basketball,'' Richardson said. ``A lot of the things you've seen in 
the past will continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the players moments ago in the locker room that we will  
continue to be about championships,'' Richardson said. ``And with 
the ingredients we have in this room, in the players, we can 
certainly do that.''

<HEADLINE> U.S., China Can't Reach Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators came close,  
but in the end they weren't able to overcome all the obstacles to 
achieving a comprehensive agreement that would throw open China's 
vast market to American exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji were able to  
strike smaller deals benefiting U.S. citrus farmers, wheat growers 
in the Pacific Northwest and beef, pork and poultry producers. 
</P>
<P>
	But four days of marathon talks did not produce the overall deal  
that Zhu had hoped would be the centerpiece of his American visit, 
a market-opening package that would win U.S. support for China's 
entry into the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Both U.S. and Chinese officials tried to put the best face on  
the failure, pledging to keep working to close the remaining gaps 
so that China will be able to gain WTO membership by November when 
the Geneva-based trade organization is scheduled to launch a new 
round of global trade negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made significant progress toward bringing China into the  
World Trade Organization on fair commercial terms, but we are not 
there yet,'' Clinton told reporters at a joint news conference with 
Zhu on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the agriculture agreements, the United States won  
agreements from China to double the number of airline flights 
between the two countries as well as promises from China to crack 
down on piracy of computer programs and to expand sales 
opportunities for American insurance firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more tantalizing for American companies, both countries  
released a lengthy list of market-opening commitments Chinese 
negotiators made in hopes of winning the comprehensive WTO deal. 
Those commitments won't become binding until the United States 
drops its objections and allows China to enter the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	But by publishing the commitments China is willing to make, the  
administration is hoping to win the backing of U.S. businesses for 
what will be a tough battle in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	China must win annual approval for its goods to be imported into  
the United States under normal tariffs applied to other countries. 
But if China gained WTO membership, Congress would have to pass 
legislation to eliminate this annual tariff approval process. 
</P>
<P>
	The record $57 billion U.S. trade deficit with China and new  
allegations about Chinese thefts of U.S. nuclear secrets have given 
added ammunition to opponents of Clinton's policy of engagement 
with China. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said the political  
hurdles in the United States made it all the more important that 
U.S. negotiators win the very best WTO deal possible. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the major sticking points that prevented agreement this  
week was China's refusal to accept a demand that the United States 
have the right to impose unilateral trade sanctions on China for a 
period of years after it enters the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration was unwilling to relent on this point,  
fearing opponents would charge that the United States had given up 
its right to enforce China's trade commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	Other areas where China's market-opening offers were deemed  
insufficient were banking, especially the ability of U.S. firms to 
offer auto loans to Chinese consumers, sales of stocks and other 
securities and distribution rights for American-made movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the United States was demanding extra protection for U.S.  
textile and apparel manufacturers by requiring China to submit to 
quotas for five years longer than any other WTO members. 
</P>
<P>
	China has been trying for 13 years to win entry in the WTO and  
the organization that preceded it, the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Various industry groups that have been hoping for agreement as a  
way to increase sales in China's vast market urged the 
administration to push ahead to a final agreement in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Great strides have been made in the right direction. What's  
important now is that we maintain our negotiating momentum,'' said 
Dianne Sullivan, director of trade policy for the National 
Association of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	But AFL-CIO President John Sweeney warned, ``China's history of  
not living up to agreements is strong cause for skepticism. 
Effective compliance mechanisms are essential to any agreement that 
may be reached.''

<HEADLINE> UN Refugee Chief Tours Kosovar Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZDA, Macedonia (AP) -- The U.N. refugee chief toured one of  
the largest of the tent camps to have sprung up in Macedonia and 
Albania in the past week, trying to bring order today to the care 
of nearly a half million displaced Kosovo Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata gently turned  
back an ethnic Albanian boy who ran up to her in the Brazda camp, 
home to 25,000 refugees, demanding to know when he could go back to 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to go there too,'' Ogata told the boy. ``We can  
go back when we could go there safely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting adequate food, blankets and shelters to the refugees  
scattered across Albania and Macedonia is still a work in progress. 
NATO troops put up the first of 2,000 tents at Brazda a week ago, 
when Serb forces were reportedly forcing ethnic Albanians out of 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogata was to talk later today with the president and prime  
minister of Macedonia, where there has been reluctance to take in 
the refugees -- now numbering 105,000 in Macedonia and 320,000 in 
Albania, according to the UNHCR. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugee influx has heightened tensions in the region. This  
week, Macedonia cleared 60,000 to 65,000 refugees from roughly the 
same area of a no man's land between Macedonia and Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	UNHCR spokeswoman Paula Ghedini said today that Macedonia had  
agreed to let the U.N. agency remove a final 1,200 refugees from 
another stretch of no man's land. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said it would work with the UNHCR in future mass  
movements of refugees, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UNHCR also finally had accounted for 10,000 refugees who  
dropped off its radar screens in the mass deportation from the 
border zone, Ghedini said. They were in Albania, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogata urged NATO troops at the Brazda camp to take names of the  
refugees to help track and care for them. British NATO troops said 
they still had yet to get registration forms. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO troops at the camp are slowly turning over the basic chores  
of running the camps to aid agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think of this place, conceived, planned and implemented in one  
week,'' Ogata said, as refugees emerged from their tents, and 
mothers cleaned and groomed their children for the day. ``That 
takes a large military organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, Belgium, NATO said it would send about 8,000 troops  
to Albania to help with logistics, infrastructure and coordination 
at airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The main airport in Albania's capital, Tirana, has been swamped  
with flights bringing in tons of aid from more than 30 countries 
that responded with pledges to help UNHCR deal with the tide of 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, 15 humanitarian flights requested clearance to land  
at Tirana's airport, but only eight were allowed to land, said U.N. 
spokesman Fred Eckhard in New York. Another 14 planes are scheduled 
to land today at Tirana. 
</P>
<P>
	While tens of thousands of refugees have been housed in  
makeshift camps near the border town of Kukes, still others have 
been spread out to cities and towns throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Albanian town of Korca, 12,000 Kosovo Albanians shipped  
out of the Macedonian border zone were camped in a sports arena, 
without mattresses or running water.

<HEADLINE> Feds Fear Harm From Side Air Bags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Side air bags in autos' rear seats can inflate  
forcefully enough to seriously injure children riding too close to 
a door, federal regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
	Bags in the back seats of Mercedes-Benz, Audi and BMW cars could  
be powerful enough to seriously harm children resting near the 
door, Transportation Department officials said Friday, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials' concerns were based either on test results the  
automakers shared with the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration or independent testing done by that agency's 
engineers using a dummy representing a 3-year-old child sleeping 
against the door, among other positions, government officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no reports of children killed or seriously  
injured by side-air bags, which have the potential to save lives in 
side-impact crashes, NHTSA says. 
</P>
<P>
	But regulators want to make sure steps are taken to prevent  
problems with side air bags after the public outcry over deaths 
from air bags deploying from the front of autos. Those air bags 
have been blamed for killing 131 people, including 73 children. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials have talked to nine automakers about  
testing the bags. Last December, NHTSA's chief, Dr. Ricardo 
Martinez, urged manufacturers to ``thoroughly test'' side air bags 
``to guard against the risk of injury'' to children. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators met again last month with officials of Mercedes,  
Audi and BMW, which offer the rear-seat bags as an option. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes spokeswoman Donna Boland said the company's testing  
showed no serious injuries to children from side air bags. However, 
a government official said NHTSA tested a Mercedes side air bag and 
the results indicated a child sleeping against the door risks 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Boland said that in the absence of a government testing standard  
for side air bags, ``all we can do is our testing, which is 
rigorous, and watch what's happening out there in the real world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Audi and BMW said they shared tests with federal officials that  
indicated 3-year-old dummies close to the door could be injured. 
The companies have issued warnings to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of the (test) results pointed to a risk of injury to  
occupants except under conditions simulating a worst-case, 
unrestrained (by a child seat) and out of position three-year-old 
dummy,'' said Audi spokesman Doug Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW spokesman Rob Mitchell said a test positioning a 3-year-old  
dummy against the door as if asleep showed ``a concern for 
potential injury'' to a child's head and neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Audi is warning consumers in the owner's manual and with a label  
affixed to the back door. The manual says ``a child must never rest 
his/her head against the side trim panel in the area where the side 
air bag inflates. An inflating air bag can cause serious or fatal 
injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BMW also has similar warnings in the owner's manual, a safety  
card in the glove box and stickers. Further, it is sending its 
dealerships cars with the rear-seat air bags turned off. Consumers 
who want them turned on must request it. Until now, the rear-seat 
bags were arriving turned on and customers had the option of 
turning them off. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of NHTSA's testing are scheduled for release April  
19 at a public meeting about side air bags. Agency officials would 
like the industry to voluntarily devise a common approach to 
testing side air bags to ensure the risks to children are minimal.

<HEADLINE> Williams Visits With the Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Ricky Williams' itinerary for his visit with  
the Browns on Friday was not unlike the other stops on his 
whirlwind tour of NFL cities. 
</P>
<P>
	His agenda:  
</P>
<P>
	1. Meet the coach, talk some football. Maybe visit with the  
owner, too. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Appear at a news conference and say he would love to play for  
``Philly or St. Louis or wherever I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	3. Head to the airport and fly to the next destination.  
</P>
<P>
	4. Repeat steps 1-3.  
</P>
<P>
	In Cleveland, however, Williams got a pleasant surprise -- he's  
still in the hunt to be the Browns' No. 1 pick in next week's 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that I still am a finalist with them to be the No.  
1 pick,'' he said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	When Williams' plane touched down in Cleveland, he admitted he  
wasn't so sure the Browns were still interested in him. But after 
spending nearly a half-hour meeting with Cleveland coach Chris 
Palmer, Williams came away with renewed hope his name might be the 
one NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue announces as the Browns' top 
pick next Saturday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a lot better,'' he said. ``Coach Palmer is such a  
straightforward guy. My hopes were down before. But I think they're 
back even right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After watching Williams work out along with nearly every other  
NFL team earlier this week in San Diego, Palmer said the Browns' 
No. 1 pick had become a three-man race between Williams, Texas' 
record-setting running back, Oregon quarterback Akili Smith and 
Kentucky QB Tim Couch. Couch will have a private workout conducted 
by the Browns on Sunday in Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Theories abound with what the Browns will do, and Williams has  
one of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know, it's tough to tell,'' he said. ``I really think  
that they don't know who they want, and I think it's going to take 
them probably until the 17th (to decide). The draft isn't about the 
No. 1 player, it's more about a team's needs and what it wants to 
do.''
