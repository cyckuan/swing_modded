<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Wraps Up Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Comparing child rearing to the careful  
nurturing of a seedling plant, the Dalai Lama said youth violence 
may stem from society's failure to promote ``warmheartedness'' in 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke of the need to infuse children with compassion, to give  
them strong morals to counterbalance desires and the importance 
religion can play in promoting nonviolent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``My belief is violence, I think, is an expression or  
manifestation of hate,'' the exiled Tibetan leader said. ``So 
nonviolence is a manifestation of a sense of caring, a sense of 
compassion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke Tuesday at Indiana University, wrapping up a  
violence-prevention conference with a panel discussion broadcast 
live on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	While other panelists discussed issues specific to American  
youth, the Dalai Lama provided sweeping thoughts on the need for 
spiritual awareness. He said there is more violence overall -- 
particularly among young people -- because of ``decades of 
negligence about basic human values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama was joined by William Sessions, former director  
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; Chief Judge Sarah Evans 
Barker of the U.S. District Court in Indianapolis; and Richard 
Kimberly, vice president of government relations for the 
Kimberly-Clark Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Religion is one way to develop that compassion, the panel  
agreed. But Sessions stressed the importance of empowering children 
and showing them that they have positive options. He pointed to the 
nonviolent philosophies of people like the Dalai Lama and Martin 
Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be taught,'' Sessions said. ``It can, in young people,  
be taught if we can convince them that in a violent world they can 
be nonviolent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama praised education, but noted that education  
without compassion is an instrument that can cause harm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Intelligence and a warm heart, these two things must go  
together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 64-year-old monk added: ``We simply want happiness or a  
happy life. We don't want pain or suffering. Violence brings 
suffering, pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 14th Dalai Lama is considered a reincarnation of the Buddha  
of compassion. He won the Nobel Prize in 1989 for his nonviolent 
efforts to win autonomy for Tibet, which has been under Chinese 
control since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama is being reunited with his brother Thubten Norbu,  
a retired Indiana University professor and founder of the Tibetan 
Cultural Center, where the Dalai Lama will perform the Kalachakra 
Initiation -- a series of rituals and teachings intended to help 
believers on the path to enlightenment.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vacation Wrapped Around Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is getting a vacation for  
his birthday this year -- if you can call down-time interwoven with 
political events a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and his family depart Thursday for a two-week respite  
divided between two places: Martha's Vineyard, a family favorite, 
and New York state, a nod to Hillary Rodham Clinton's senatorial 
aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday also is the president's 53rd birthday. Clinton is  
scheduled to begin the day discussing the impact of the ``baby boom 
echo'' on school enrollment, but otherwise the White House was 
tight-lipped about his plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes it's a surprise, so maybe we should leave it at  
that,'' said White House spokesman Jake Siewert. He did say that 
Clinton would celebrate his birthday during his stay on the island; 
Clinton's friend Vernon Jordan threw parties for him each of the 
past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the fifth Martha's Vineyard vacation for the Clintons.  
They will spend nine days on the 20-acre Oyster Pond estate of 
developer Richard Friedman, their host for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	They are expected to be far more visible this year than last,  
when they remained indoors because Clinton's admission that he had 
an affair with Monica Lewinsky was still fresh. 
</P>
<P>
	Now though, with the Lewinsky matter ended and Mrs. Clinton's  
bid for a Senate seat from New York all but official, the president 
and first lady are making lots of plans. Already, they have 
penciled in a jaunt to Nantucket on Friday for an event with the 
American-Ireland Fund, a non-profit group that finances educational 
ventures in Northern Ireland and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund has agreed to finance projects for Vital Voices, an  
effort to foster understanding between Protestants and Catholics 
that Mrs. Clinton has been involved with in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 28th, the Clintons leave the Vineyard to go to East  
Hampton, N.Y., where they will take part in a Democratic National 
Committee weekend retreat and other events to help raise money for 
Democratic candidates. On the 30th, they go to Skaneateles in 
upstate New York, returning to Washington at the start of the Labor 
Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Siewert acknowledged there were plans for the Clintons to make  
appearances during their stay in New York state, but ``on balance, 
the vacation will be a vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skaneateles, a quiet resort town of 7,500 people on Skaneateles  
Lake just southwest of Syracuse, once was a stop on the Civil 
War-era Underground Railroad that ferried slaves north to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons will stay at the lakeside home of real estate  
developer Thomas McDonald.

<HEADLINE> DePauw Univ. in Ind. Receives $98M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENCASTLE, Ind. (AP) -- A small liberal arts school has  
received a $98.4 million gift from the estate of an Indianapolis 
industrialist and his wife who met there. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined with $30 million donated in 1997, the $128.4 million  
Ruth Clark and Philip Forbes Holton Memorial Fund will provide 
scholarships to DePauw University students from Indiana, Illinois, 
Michigan and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the largest gift in the private school's history.  
</P>
<P>
	DePauw President Robert G. Bottoms said he had no idea until two  
weeks ago how large the gift would be. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost unbelievable,'' Bottoms said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The gift will generate about $6.25 million in scholarship funds  
each year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Holton was president and chief executive officer of  
Inland Container Corp. He was the starting quarterback for DePauw 
as a freshman before he and his wife, whom he met at the school, 
transferred to the University of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Holton died in 1995 at age 88. Mrs. Holton died in 1997 at age  
90. 
</P>
<P>
	DePauw, founded in 1837, is located about 40 miles west of  
Indianapolis and has about 2,200 students.

<HEADLINE> Falwell Won't Change Gay Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) -- The Rev. Jerry Falwell says he'll tone  
down his anti-gay rhetoric, but he won't change his view that 
homosexuality is a sin. 
</P>
<P>
	The founder of the defunct Moral Majority met Tuesday with  
another preacher, the Rev. Mel White, who plans to bring 200 gays 
and lesbians to an Oct. 23 dinner here with Falwell and 200 of his 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	White said he sees the dinner as an opportunity for people to  
share their experiences. Falwell said he has his own concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I speak constantly around the country and almost invariably  
some of the radical activists ... disrupt the meeting or commit 
violent acts,'' he said. ``Mel sincerely wants to lower the 
rhetoric on both sides. That is exactly what we want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Falwell said he still believes homosexuality is a sin.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Falwell drew criticism after a newspaper he  
publishes warned parents that Tinky Winky, the purple 
``Teletubbies'' character from the children's TV show, could be a 
gay role model.

<HEADLINE> Crew 4, MetroStars 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Stern John tallied three goals and  
took over the Major League Soccer goal-scoring lead as the Columbus 
Crew handed the New York New Jersey MetroStars their eighth 
straight loss, 4-2 Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	John, who registered his second hat trick of the season and a  
record fifth of his MLS career, now has 16 goals and is one ahead 
of D.C. United's Roy Lassiter. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory boosted Columbus to 15-8 and left the Crew in second  
place in the MLS East with 35 points. The MetroStars, who have lost 
14 of 15, are now 5-18 with nine points. 
</P>
<P>
	John tallied his first goal in the 17th minute with a header  
into the right corner of the MetroStars net. 
</P>
<P>
	The play began with a corner kick by Robert Warzycha which went  
to Brian Maisonneuve at the top of the box. Maisonneuve volleyed 
the ball to John and when the MetroStars' attempt at an offside 
trap failed, John headed the ball home. 
</P>
<P>
	After missing several good chances, the MetroStars finally tied  
it in the 38th minute after Ansel Elcock's foul on Miles Joseph 
gave the home team a free kick from just outside the box. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Kelly bent his free kick into the box where Mark Semioli  
looped a header over Columbus goalkeeper Mark Dougherty, who had 
come off his line. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus wasted little time taking charge in the second half.  
The Crew snapped the deadlock in the 47th minute on a left-footed 
shot from the top of the box by John DeBrito following a Warzycha 
free kick. 
</P>
<P>
	John then took over, running into a header from Brian McBride  
and flicking in a shot from short-range in the 59th minute. Three 
minutes later Warzycha recorded his third assist of the game, 
passing to McBride whose cross was headed home by John. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars closed the scoring in the 77th minute when John  
Wolyniec, on loan from the Long Island Roughriders, knocked home a 
rebound of a shot by Petter Villegas.

<HEADLINE> Stacy Dean Campbell: Plenty To Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The prisoner serving ``a year and  
ninety-nine'' in Stacy Dean Campbell's finely crafted song ``I'm 
Gonna Fly'' finds release only when he dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	Things never felt THAT dire for the 32-year-old  
singer-songwriter as he fruitlessly pursued country music stardom 
in the mid-1990s with two overlooked Sony Nashville albums. 
</P>
<P>
	But being a moody, contemplative artist in a sea of perky  
Nashville go-getter singers took its toll. The talented but 
reserved Campbell never quite fit in, and eventually the goal of 
country music stardom became a sort of prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was once a guard for a detective that would go and get  
prisoners and bring them back to Oklahoma,'' said Campbell, a 
native of Carlsbad, N.M. ``I think a lot of (`I'm Gonna Fly') came 
from seeing some of those people. 
</P>
<P>
	``And just the feeling of needing freedom, I guess.''  
</P>
<P>
	Four years after his ``Hurt City'' album tanked and he left  
Sony, Campbell is showing what he can do with a little freedom on 
his new CD ``Ashes of Old Love.'' It was released by Paladin 
Records and is distributed by Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the time I got off Sony, I think I was a little bit  
relieved and kind of anxious to go see what else was out there. I 
kind of sat back and didn't pursue another deal for a while. I 
wanted to spend some time writing and trying to develop myself as 
more of a singer-songwriter and a more well-rounded artist,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was ready, he recruited his older brother Spencer to  
co-produce ``Ashes of Old Love.'' Campbell wrote three of the 
album's 11 songs and co-wrote five others. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent Paladin label doesn't have much money to promote  
its artists, so Campbell is playing smaller clubs than he did in 
his Sony days. But he says that suits his low-key songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to concentrate on trying to play more listening  
rooms and smaller venues that focus a little more on music and not 
quite as much on partying,'' Campbell said. ``I don't want to go 
into a club where people want to dance and I'm up there with an 
acoustic guitar singing `I'm Gonna Fly.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow performers Chris Knight and Bruce Robison are already  
playing the so-called alt-country circuit of listening rooms, and 
Campbell is following suit. But he isn't giving up the dream of 
mainstream stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never felt like I was that far removed from the  
mainstream,'' he said. ``I listen to (the single) `Makin' Good 
Time' and I don't see that as being too far off the mark from a lot 
of things that are playing on mainstream radio, so I really don't 
consider myself left of center. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became a real personal goal for me to make this record and  
do it the way I wanted to do it and get it out. Now I'm kind of 
sitting back going, `Well, I don't really know where I'm going to 
go from here.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell grew up in the desert Southwest, raised primarily by  
his grandparents after his parents divorced when he was 3. His 
grandfather introduced him to the records of Marty Robbins and 
Johnny Cash. Campbell sang along with Everly Brothers hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Pestered by his brother, who played in a succession of rock  
bands, Campbell sang 1980s hits with a club band, but didn't 
consider it a potential career. 
</P>
<P>
	He studied criminal justice and was offered a job in that field  
in Oklahoma City, when his brother persuaded Campbell to join him 
in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell arrived in 1990. Two years later, Sony released his  
first album, ``Lonesome Wins Again.'' Campbell got some minor radio 
play with singles ``Rosalee'' and ``Poor Man's Rose,'' and Sony 
emphasized his dark good looks in its marketing. He was 24 and 
still somewhat shy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had gotten signed so quickly at Sony and I was so young that  
I hadn't really had enough time to develop as a songwriter and to 
develop a style,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ashes of Old Love'' is a reflection of the artist. Campbell is  
the kind of guy who would never shout for attention in a crowded 
room. But if you're willing to lean in to hear his soft-spoken 
voice, he has interesting stories to tell. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``One False Move,'' he's an uncertain, desperate car-jacker:  
``I got a woman, she likes fancy things/Cadillacs and diamond 
rings/And it's just your luck/You drive an Eldorado.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Material like this evokes Bruce Springsteen in his quieter  
moments. ``Makin' Good Time'' could be the story of ``Born to Run'' 
continued 500 miles down the road, when excitement begins giving 
way to reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Flatlands and cotton fields/White knuckles on a steering  
wheel/I watch the world go rollin' by/And your head against the 
window/My jacket for a pillow/I hear you breathing/As the engine 
softly whines/And I don't know where we're going/But we're makin' 
good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said he has listened to Springsteen and Steve Earle,  
and is inspired by short story writers such as Larry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just a real fan of that blue-collar Southern culture. ...  
I'm a big fan of movies that have that kind of underdog character 
in them. I don't find a lot of interest in characters that are just 
happy all the time.''

<HEADLINE> ACLU Sues Over School Drug Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The American Civil Liberties Union filed a  
federal lawsuit Wednesday challenging a school district's policy of 
drug-testing not just athletes but also students who take part in 
such activities as the debate team, choir and marching band. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU said the lawsuit is the first in the nation to  
challenge mandatory testing of students who participate in 
extracurricular activities that are tied to their courses during 
the regular school day. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed on behalf of two 16-year-old high school  
juniors in Tecumseh, a small town 35 miles southeast of Oklahoma 
City. The suit does not challenge the testing of athletes or 
students suspected of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	In the lawsuit, the ACLU says refusal to take a drug test would  
bar students from some classes for which they earn credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``For instance, a student can take the choir class only if she  
also participates in the extracurricular choir activities. Thus the 
drug testing policy effectively applies to parts of a public 
school's core legally required function -- the education of its 
students,'' the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for the Tecumseh School District and the  
superintendent did not return calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The district's drug-testing policy applies to any student who  
wishes to participate in extracurricular activities, athletic or 
academic. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the plaintiffs, Lindsay Earls, had to take a urine test  
to join the choir, marching band and quiz bowl team. The ACLU said 
that if she refused, her only other way of fulfilling the school's 
arts requirement would be to take ceramics or music appreciation, 
which are not as challenging and would not look as good on her 
college applications. 
</P>
<P>
	The other plaintiff, Daniel James, said he had already pledged  
to remain drug-free as a member of a peer counseling group and 
objected to having to take a drug test to join the quiz bowl team. 
</P>
<P>
	ACLU attorney Graham Boyd said the district suspended  
enforcement of the drug policy Tuesday night, after he contacted 
the district about the planned lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court last year refused to hear a challenge to  
an Indiana high school's policy of drug-testing all students in 
extracurricular activities. However, ACLU officials said the 
Tecumseh policy is different because of the way it can force 
students to drop out of academic classes.

<HEADLINE> Investigation Would Go With Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr  
has been told by Justice Department officials that, if he were to 
leave office, they probably would be unable to take over his 
unfinished investigation of President Clinton and his wife, 
Hillary, a Justice Department official says. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's never said to us, 'I'm leaving,''' said the official, who  
spoke late Tuesday only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	But Starr's staff has had theoretical discussions with Justice  
Department attorneys about how his unfinished work would be handled 
if he left, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr, whose five-year investigation of the Clintons led to the  
first impeachment of a president since Andrew Johnson in 1868, 
resigned once before, in February 1997, to take a job at Pepperdine 
University in California. But he rescinded it within days after 
coming under heavy criticism for leaving the post before his 
investigation was completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department official said Starr's aides and the  
department's staff attorneys had discussed the possibility and 
ramifications of referring the unfinished investigation back to the 
Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said that was probably impossible given the kind of things  
he's investigating,'' the official said. ``We said we would either 
have to decline to accept them or seek a new independent counsel or 
special counsel to complete the work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office would not comment Tuesday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Among the ongoing subjects of Starr's investigation is first  
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's work in the 1980s as a private lawyer 
on a fraudulent Arkansas land deal that played a role in the 
insolvency of a Little Rock, Ark., savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's inquiry was expanded by federal court to include a  
controversy about the Clinton White House's use of FBI files, 
possible lies by presidential aides in the White House travel 
office firings and the Monica Lewinsky sex and cover-up case. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said last week he hoped to wrap up the investigation and  
write a final report at the ``earliest practicable moment.'' He 
told reporters he expected the work to be completed before the 
general election in November 2000, when Mrs. Clinton likely will be 
the Democratic nominee for a U.S. Senate seat from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation's status, should Starr resign, is murky  
because the independent counsel law expired at the end of June. The 
act provided that Starr and any other existing independent counsel 
could complete their work but did not specify what was to happen if 
a counsel resigned once the act expired and the work wasn't 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
	All the matters Starr has been investigating were initially  
referred to the independent counsel to avoid a conflict of interest 
if investigated by the Justice Department. The Justice official 
said the now-expired act allowed an independent counsel to refer 
cases back to the department only when they were ``substantially 
completed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If any independent counsel chose to step down before an  
investigation were completed, it might raise questions we would 
want to address,'' said Myron Marlin, a Justice Department 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the act's silence, there would be a certain logic in  
Starr asking the three-judge panel to name a successor, one Justice 
Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's investigation of Clinton's relationship with Ms.  
Lewinsky led to the president's impeachment by the House and 
subsequent acquittal by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's report to the House on possible impeachable offenses  
found ``substantial and credible evidence'' of perjury and 
obstruction by the president.

<HEADLINE> Feds Indict Suburban Gun Dealers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Opening a new front in the war on gun violence,  
federal prosecutors announced indictments today against suburban 
gun sellers accused of helping put firearms in the hands of 
drug-selling street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials said ``Operation Surefire,'' in which federal  
agents cooperated with Chicago police, represented the first 
concerted attack on suburban gun shops that furnish arms to 
city-based gangs responsible for hundreds of homicides. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is simple -- if you violate the gun laws, you're  
going to prison,'' U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar said in announcing 
the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 13 people were charged.  
</P>
<P>
	Owners and employees of five suburban gun shops were charged  
with avoiding state laws designed to keep guns out of the hands of 
criminals by selling guns to ``straw purchasers'' -- people with 
clean records who then turn the weapons over to gang members 
convicted of past crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Individuals accused of buying guns illegally were also charged.  
</P>
<P>
	The indictments follow a $433 million lawsuit filed by the city  
of Chicago against suburban gun dealers and the firearms industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Richard M. Daley ordered the lawsuit filed after a 1998  
undercover investigation by Chicago police found that some suburban 
gun dealers had sidestepped laws designed to keep guns away from 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Handgun sales to civilians are banned in Chicago, but the city  
has been racked by gun violence, especially on the part of 
drug-selling gangs who have thousands of members and are 
responsible for hundreds of homicides. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassar said that one of the defendants was found to have  
purchased 186 guns in one year.

<HEADLINE> Mets, Cubs May Play in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It looks like sushi will join hot dogs and beer  
on the menu for opening day, with the New York Mets and Chicago 
Cubs set to open next season in Tokyo under a deal that is all but 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	The two games at the Tokyo Dome, March 29-30, would be the first  
regular-season games played outside North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Players on the two teams have approved the trip, and the team  
managements also gave their permission. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking to expand the game,'' said Cubs pitcher Steve  
Trachsel, the team's player representative. ``That's the logical 
place to go since they already play baseball. They love baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the trip, the Mets and Cubs would play a total of  
four exhibition games in the Tokyo area on March 27-28, including 
at least one against the Yomiuri Giants, officials familiar with 
the negotiations said Tuesday on the condition they not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of indifferent. It seemed all the guys wanted to  
go,'' Mets catcher Mike Piazza said. ``The only thing is, you think 
what the negatives are: a week to go in spring training and it's 
going to be impossible to have all the pitchers get the work they 
need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the trip, the Mets would be off until their home opener  
against San Diego on April 4. The Cubs would be off until an April 
4 game at the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it's probably not the most convenient thing we'll ever  
do, it was in our opinion the right thing to do, so we 
acquiesced,'' Cubs president Andy MacPhail said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	MacPhail is awaiting word from the commissioner's office that  
the deal has been finalized. An official of the Tokyo Giants was in 
New York late last week for negotiations, and there were some minor 
issues left to settle, major league officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials expect to make an announcement sometime this  
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets did not want to talk about the trip until there is a  
formal announcement, team spokesman Jay Horwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful opportunity for the Japanese fans, and not  
only the Japanese fans, but the Japanese baseball players, to see 
the real live major league baseball,'' Mets pitcher Masato Yoshii, 
who is Japanese, said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be an honor to be part of it,'' Yoshii said. ``The  
only thing is, it's a long trip from Florida, and I'm not looking 
forward to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Major league officials have discussed for several years the  
possibility of regular-season games in Japan, but some teams argued 
the trip would be too arduous. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fine with me,'' Cubs first baseman Mark Grace said.  
``It's definitely a long way to go, but I've been there before. It 
was a decent experience, so I don't mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo is nearly 7,400 miles from West Palm Beach, Fla., the  
major airport nearest the Mets' spring training camp in Port St. 
Lucie, Fla. The Cubs would travel from the Phoenix area. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you get the opportunity to see if you're willing to  
do what you talk about,'' MacPhail said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle originally proposed the idea for the 1995 season, but  
that was scuttled because of the 7 1/2-month strike. When talk was 
revived last spring, St. Louis was the first choice of the 
commissioner's office as the Mets' opponent, but the Cardinals 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Home run king Mark McGwire, who would have been the chief  
attraction, was against the idea, saying: ``Major league baseball 
belongs in the United States. The Japanese have Japanese baseball, 
so there's no reason for us to go over there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner's office then turned to the Cubs, popular in  
Japan because of Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, baseball opened the season outside the United States  
and Canada for the first time, with San Diego playing the Colorado 
Rockies in Monterrey, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In the only other regular-season games outside the United States  
and Canada, the Padres and Mets played a three-game series in 
Monterrey in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA will be playing regular-season games in Japan for the  
fifth time when the Minnesota Timberwolves and San Antonio Spurs 
meet at the Tokyo Dome on Nov. 6-7. 
</P>
<P>
	In the NHL, the Calgary Flames played the San Jose Sharks last  
October in a two-game series, the league's second regular-season 
trip to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has never played a regular-season game outside the  
United States, but has played numerous exhibitions.

	Death Toll at 2,399 in Turkey Quake  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- With thousands of people reported  
missing along an 80-mile arc of destruction left by a devastating 
earthquake, disaster relief teams from around the world today 
joined overwhelmed Turkish rescue crews in the hunt for bodies and 
survivors. At least 2,399 people were killed and nearly 14,000 
injured in Tuesday's immense quake, which shook western Turkey from 
Istanbul to the Golcuk area about 80 miles southeast, according to 
a special crisis office headed by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit. It 
was almost certain the casualty count would climb, however. Some 
Turkish newspapers carried headlines today saying up to 3,000 
people died.

<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russia's defense minister led senior  
security officials to Dagestan today as Moscow stepped up its 
operations in the 12-day fight against Islamic militants holding 
several mountain villages. About 500 soldiers and 30 pieces of 
armor were airlifted to the battle zone Tuesday as Russia continues 
to pour resources into the volatile Caucasus Mountains region, 
Russian news agencies reported. The Russians have not given any 
figures for their overall forces in the area, but they are believed 
to number several thousand.

	Astronomers Baffled by Space Light

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An arsenal of analytic tools used to figure  
out the makeup and distance of stars and galaxies has failed to 
unlock the secrets of a mysterious celestial light detected three 
years ago. ``It's fairly uncommon to stumble on something you don't 
have a clue about,'' astronomer S. George Djorgovski said 
yesterday. Djorgovski was part of the team at Caltech's Palomar 
Observatory that detected the object, a pinpoint of light, during a 
digital survey of the northern sky. It remains one of the biggest 
mysteries uncovered by the Digital Palomar Sky Survey.

	China To Restrict Manufacturing

	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- China unveiled new steps today to break  
out of its deflationary spiral, barring new plans for the 
manufacture of products ranging from video compact disk players to 
toothpaste. Prices in China's glutted consumer goods markets have 
been falling since October 1997. Regulators have imposed minimum 
prices in some industries to prevent producers from bankrupting 
each other with price-cutting wars. Chinese leaders regard 
deflation as the most serious economic threat facing the country.

	Teen Drug Use Falls, Finally  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teen drug use fell last year, with about one  
in 10 teen-agers using marijuana and other drugs, the government 
reports today. Officials say it's solid evidence that the nation 
has turned a corner after rising drug use through the mid-1990s. 
Overall, drug use among Americans of all ages remained level, but 
use among young adults continued its steady rise, according to the 
annual household survey of 25,500 people ages 12 and up. All told, 
78 million Americans had tried illegal drugs at some point in their 
lives.

northern Congolese city turned into an uneasy calm after Uganda and 
Rwanda agreed to an immediate cease-fire. The two nations, whose 
fighters had been battling in the streets of Kisangani since 
Saturday, agreed last night to put down their arms. The agreement, 
which called for an immediate end to the fighting in Kisangani, 
followed talks between Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and 
Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame at Queen Elizabeth National Park

Brian Anderson threw a three-hitter last night as the Arizona 
Diamondbacks beat the Chicago Cubs 4-0. Greg Colbrunn's 
bases-loaded triple in the first inning gave Anderson all the 
offense he needed. The Diamondbacks beat the Cubs for the sixth 
time in a row and fifth time in the last nine days.

	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Craig Paquette hit a two-run double in the  
ninth inning for his third straight go-ahead hit, and the St. Louis 
Cardinals rallied for a 6-5 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies 
last night. Mark McGwire was 1-for-2 with a double, a sacrifice fly 
and two walks, remaining at 47 homers, the same number he had after 
121 games en route to his record 70 homers last year.

<HEADLINE> 2.7M Americans May Have Hepatitis C </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	At least 2.7 million Americans carry the hepatitis C virus,  
making it the most common blood-borne infection in the United 
States, according to a study in today's New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in  
Atlanta represents the first look at the prevalence of hepatitis C 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what we consider a conservative estimate,'' said Dr.  
Harold Margolis of the CDC. ``This is everyday Mr. and Mrs. 
American who live in a household. This doesn't include the homeless 
and the prison population. The number could be higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For reasons that aren't entirely clear, an estimated 1.2 million  
other people who were once infected no longer have any signs of the 
virus, Margolis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists discovered the virus in 1989.  
</P>
<P>
	People who inject illegal drugs or engage in unprotected sex  
account for most people who carry hepatitis C, but people who had 
blood transfusions before mid-1992 also are at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease and alcohol abuse rank as the leading causes of  
liver disease. The infection can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer 
and results in about 1,000 liver transplants annually in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The standard treatment is the drug interferon or a combination  
of interferon and ribavirin. In some patients, drugs can make all 
signs of the virus disappear, but it's unclear how long the effect 
lasts.

<HEADLINE>  8 Russian Soldiers Killed in Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOTLIKH, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops battled Islamic militants  
today in mountain fighting that cost Russia its worst single-day 
losses of the 12-day conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight Russian troops were killed and 20 wounded in the fighting  
in Dagestan, a Russian Republic in the Caucasus Mountain region 
where militants want to set up an independent Islamic state. 
</P>
<P>
	Dagestani officials announced the Russian casualties. No figures  
on rebel losses were available. 
</P>
<P>
	The troops were battling rebels for a second day in and around  
the southern village of Tando. It was not clear who had control of 
the area. Russia has been bombing Tando's outskirts for several 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the Russian military said it has seized control of a  
key mountain pass that the militants had been using to ferry in 
fighters and supplies from neighboring Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kharami mountain pass, which sits on the border between  
Dagestan and Chechnya, served as an important infiltration route 
for the rebels, according to the Russian Interior Ministry. The 
rebels will now have less room to maneuver and will find it more 
difficult to bring in men and supplies from breakaway Chechnya, the 
Russians said. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants invaded Aug. 7 from Chechnya, a rebellious  
territory that has been effectively independent since Russian 
forces pulled out in 1996 following a two-year war. The conflict in 
Dagestan is the worst inside Russia since the Chechnya war ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to today's ground combat, Russia appeared to be relying  
mostly on jets and helicopter gunships to attack the remote 
villages, and a new round of airstrikes began this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In another development, Russia's Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev  
led a group of senior security officials to Dagestan to get a 
closer look at the Russian operation. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 soldiers and 30 pieces of armor were airlifted to the  
battle zone Tuesday as Russia continues to pour resources into the 
volatile Caucasus Mountains, Russian news agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians have not given any figures for their overall forces  
in the area, but they are believed to number several thousand. The 
rebel force has been estimated at around 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian jets and helicopter gunships carried out 24 airstrikes  
against the rebels Tuesday, and destroyed a television and radio 
relay station that the militants were using, news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow says the rebels will be crushed quickly, but they still  
have full control of at least three villages in the mountains near 
Dagestan's border with the breakaway territory of Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Interior Ministry says that 450 rebels have been  
killed, while 22 Russian soldiers have died since the fighting 
began. The rebels say they have lost far fewer fighters than the 
Russians allege.

<HEADLINE> Keillor Story To Become Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A story Garrison Keillor wrote 15 years ago  
for The New Yorker magazine will be turned into a 15-minute film. 
</P>
<P>
	The premise of Keillor's ``End of the Tale'' is that cigarette  
smoking is outlawed with the passage of the 28th Amendment to the 
Constitution, and the country's last five smokers are tracked to a 
box canyon in the Sierras. 
</P>
<P>
	``Garrison was prescient in 1984 ... and he gets more prescient  
as our government tightens the noose around smokers' throats,'' 
said co-producer Irv Letofsky, a former Minnesota newspaper 
reporter and TV critic. 
</P>
<P>
	Letofsky and his wife, Brian Ann Zoccola, adapted the article  
for the short film, which will be shot in Minnesota next spring.

<HEADLINE> Company Settles Age Bias Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- An electronics company has agreed to pay 800  
former employees a total of $7.1 million to settle an 
age-discrimination lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had alleged that a  
severance deal Thomson Consumer Electronics reached with union 
representatives violated federal law by giving younger workers more 
in severance than older ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``This settlement sends a very clear message that paying older  
workers less money in severance benefits is discriminatory and 
unlawful,'' EEOC Commissioner Paul Steven Miller said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson and the union reached the severance deal in 1997 for  
about 1,100 workers in Bloomington and 420 workers in Indianapolis 
who lost their jobs when one plant was closed and staff at the 
other drastically cut back. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gave more money to younger longtime workers because  
they had more years to wait until they could start getting their 
pension at age 55. Workers over the age of 55 got no bonus at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, Thomson admits no wrongdoing, said

<HEADLINE> $2,000 Offered in Jesus Art Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For a $2,000 prize and a place on the millennium-issue cover of  
a Catholic newsweekly, artists worldwide are being invited to 
create a bold new image of Jesus to mark the 2,000th anniversary of 
his birth. 
</P>
<P>
	The contest welcomes all visual media -- computer art, stained  
glass, silk screens, even photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	The only sure bet is that the winning entry, due by Oct. 18,  
won't resemble the traditional images of Jesus evoked by artists of 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until our time, this was the most popular subject for  
artists,'' said Michael Farrell, editor of the National Catholic 
Reporter, which is sponsoring the contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are giving us a repeat of any of those images, it's not  
likely you are on the winning ticket. There ought to be something 
new that we have never seen before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nigel Holmes, former graphics chief for Time magazine and a  
leading graphics designer, said the contest would surely appeal to 
the growing ranks of computer artists. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some who'd say, `I wouldn't touch it' and others  
who'd love to do it, because it's such an odd kind of challenge,'' 
Holmes said. ``I might do it myself. It's a brilliant marketing 
idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contest arose from Farrell's frustration over the buildup to  
the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ask anybody about the millennium, and they talk about  
survivalists going into the mountains, or glitches on their 
computers,'' he said from the National Catholic Reporter's Kansas 
City, Mo., office. ``Nobody is talking about this extraordinary man 
who came from heaven 2000 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five entries have arrived since the contest was announced July  
30. He said the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did some talk shows in Canada,'' Farrell said. ``Maybe 1  
percent of the callers, a bit on the conservative side, talked 
about graven images and said we were wrong to be promoting this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its article announcing the contest, the independent  
publication questioned why so few fresh, captivating images of 
Jesus had emerged in the late 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can it be that the spirit of the age excludes messiahs and  
saviors?'' it asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Entrants must send slides of their work. A three-member jury  
will select 10 finalists. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner and three runners-up will be chosen by Sister Wendy  
Beckett, the 69-year-old British nun who stars in a public 
television series about art. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners will be announced and displayed in the Christmas  
issue, due out Dec. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes said some graphic designers, rather trying to depict  
Jesus' face, might offer a corporate-style logo symbolizing 
modern-day Christianity. Another possibility for computer artists 
would be to scan in a person of every ethnic race to make a 
composite portrait. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd come up with a sort of universal face, and you could  
say, `Here's the new face of Jesus -- he is everyone,''' Holmes 
said. ``You'd offend somebody, no matter what you did. I'd hate to 
be in the judges' shoes.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Great Lakes Water Moratorium Backed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Canada should impose a  
six-month moratorium on sale of Great Lakes water while a study is 
completed on whether there is enough to export, a U.S.-Canadian 
commission recommended today. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Joint Commission, which helps the two nations  
manage their border waters, said a moratorium should extend both to 
bulk removal of surface water and new removals of groundwater from 
the Great Lakes basin. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission experts are halfway through a yearlong study of  
issues related to water diversion and sales, and issued an interim 
report today. Among the preliminary conclusions: 
</P>
<P>
	--It is impossible to predict all the adverse consequences of any  
large-scale water removals. 
</P>
<P>
	--Taking water out of the system reduces its ability to cope with  
future stresses on the Great Lakes basin. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Great Lakes system does not have a water surplus, even in  
years with high water levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every drop of water has several potential uses and tradeoffs  
must be made when human intervention takes place and waters are 
removed from the system,'' the commission said in a written 
release. During cycles in which water levels are high, local 
habitats are renewed and fresh water is provided to fisheries as 
far away as the Gulf of Maine, the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	People on both sides of the lakes were upset last year when a  
Canadian company applied for permission to ship some Lake Superior 
water to Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, according to the commission, no major diversion  
projects are being proposed and ``there is little reason to believe 
that such projects will become economically, environmentally and 
socially feasible in the foreseeable future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite increased popularity of bottled water, the commission  
said, the amount leaving the lakes that way is not significant. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said it examined trade treaties, such as the  
World Trade Organization agreements and the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, and concluded nothing in those pacts would thwart 
efforts to protect the ecosystem of the Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	There already is an effort in Congress to stop Great Lakes water  
from being exported, and Canada has announced its own plan to ban 
large-scale exports.

<HEADLINE> Nebiolo Elected as IAAF President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Primo Nebiolo, who has ruled track and  
field for two decades, was reelected to a sixth term today as 
president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 76-year-old Italian, the only candidate on the ballot, was  
reaffirmed by acclamation for another four-year mandate at the IAAF 
Congress on the eve of the World Championships in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebiolo received a standing ovation from the delegates after  
IAAF vice president Lamine Diack praised his ``exceptional 
competence'' and asked for a unanimous vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have dedicated my life to athletics,'' Nebiolo said after  
the applause. ``I pledge you my energy and commitment and will 
strive to live up to your expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nebiolo, who has run the IAAF since 1981, has retained his  
unchallenged hold on power despite rumors of ill health and 
frequent complaints about his autocratic style. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than a year, Nebiolo has been rumored to be suffering  
from prostate cancer, but he and his aides have denied the 
suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am well and I hope people continue to talk about my health  
because it brings me luck,'' Nebiolo said this week. ``I heard I am 
sick, but what can I say? I am not the fighter I once was, but I am 
still in perfect shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two decades, Nebiolo has been among the world's  
most powerful sports rulers, along with IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch and former world soccer (FIFA) president Joao Havelange. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being chief of the IAAF, Nebiolo has been  
president of the International University Sport Federation (FISU) 
since 1961, president of the Association of Summer Olympics 
International Federations (ASOIF) since 1983, a member of the 
International Olympic Committee since 1992, and president of the 
University Sports Club of Turin, his hometown, since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	During his time in power, Nebiolo has revolutionized the sport  
and his federation. 
</P>
<P>
	When he took over in 1981, the IAAF had fewer than 100 members.  
Now, there are 210. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF had a one-room office in a dingy London neighborhood.  
For the past six years, it has had a sprawling layout in wealthy 
and glamorous Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization's budget then was $50,000. Now, it's more than  
$50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebiolo has skillfully overseen the transition of the sport from  
amateur to professional. 
</P>
<P>
	He introduced prize money, appearance fees, world-record  
bonuses, the world indoor and outdoor championships, the World Cup, 
the lucrative Grand Prix and Golden League circuits, and the world 
cross country, world marathon, world half-marathon and world junior 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	While directing the IAAF's steady growth, Nebiolo also has been  
the center of much controversy. He has been called dictatorial, 
scheming and money grabbing, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action today, the IAAF elected four vice presidents:  
Diack of Senegal, Arne Ljungqvist of Sweden, Amadeo Frances of 
Puerto Rico, and Lou Dapeng of China. They also were the only 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Also reappointed by acclamation was honorary treasurer Robert  
Stinson of Britain.

<HEADLINE> Three Missing in Lake Michigan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAUKEGAN, Ill. (AP) -- The Coast Guard scoured Lake Michigan  
today for a paper company executive and his two daughters after 
their sailboat was found drifting in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard search began late Monday after Harry Bull, 39, and  
daughters Maddie, 7, and Lexi, 5, failed to return from an 
overnight sailing trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Tuesday, a Coast Guard cutter found the 26-foot sailboat --  
named Semper Spero, Latin for ``Always Hope'' -- in good condition 
with its sails down about 27 miles east of Waukegan Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Petty Officer 2nd Class Paul Calvey said the boat showed ``no  
sign that it had encountered bad weather or sea conditions, no sign 
of mechanical trouble, no sign of a struggle or of physical 
ditress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing out of the ordinary is that the swim ladder was  
down in the water,'' Calvey said. Bull had a cellular phone -- it 
was found on the boat -- but had not called in any request for help. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had been told to expect there were nine life jackets on the  
boat, but there were only four,'' Calvey added. ``So, we're hopeful 
that three of those jackets are on our missing three people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bull, described as experienced at sailing, and his daughters had  
left Chicago on Sunday planning to sail to Waukegan, spend the 
night and return Monday. Waukegan is roughly 40 miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard jet flew in from Massachusetts on Tuesday to join  
other planes, helicopters and search-and-rescue boats scouring a 
5,400-square-mile area of the lake. A plane flew over the area 
overnight, and other aircraft and boats rejoined the search after 
daybreak today. 
</P>
<P>
	Bull is chairman of Bradner Central Co., a family-owned Chicago  
company that distributes business forms and other paper products. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his wife also have an infant son.

	Turkey Quake Claims 4,000 Lives  
</P>
<P>
	IZMIT, Turkey (AP) -- The death toll in Tuesday's earthquake has  
now risen past 4,000, officials say, and another 10,000 are left 
missing in the rubble. The 7.4-magnitude earthquake left wide 
sections of western Turkey in ruins and threatens to derail its 
already-struggling economy. So far, 4,053 people have died and 
nearly 18,500 were injured in the quake, according to a special 
Turkish crisis unit.

	Bush Won't Answer Drug Questions  
</P>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush says he hasn't used illegal  
drugs within the past seven years, while insisting that such 
personal issues have no place in the 2000 presidential race. He 
snapped at reporters asking about possible illegal drug use 
Wednesday, saying he would ``refuse to play'' that game. But he 
answered a hypothetical question The Dallas Morning News put to him 
later in the day. The newspaper questioned him about the 
requirement that federal employees answer questions about drug use 
to get high-level security clearances. ``As I understand it, the 
current form asks the question, 'Did somebody use drugs within the 
last seven years?' and I will be glad to answer that question, and 
the answer is 'No,''' the News, in a story for Thursday's editions, 
quoted Bush as saying in New Orleans.

	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- An hour before it crashed, John F.  
Kennedy Jr.'s plane came close enough to an American Airlines plane 
that a radar controller alerted the crew on the jetliner, 
investigators said. The National Transportation Safety Board 
confirmed the incident but it was not clear how close the planes 
came to each other, The Providence Journal reported Wednesday. The 
planes were close enough to prompt the traffic advisory to the 
commercial plane, but there was ``no apparent risk of collision,'' 
according to NTSB spokesman Paul Schlamm. Such advisories are not 
rare, Schlamm said. He said the incident was not serious enough to 
require a course adjustment.

	Reduced Sentence for Lyons Denied

<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- A judge refused Wednesday to reduce  
the 5 1/2-year state prison sentence for the Rev. Henry Lyons, the 
former leader of a large and influential black church denomination. 
The judge said the sentence for racketeering and grand theft was 
fair and took into consideration Lyons' good deeds. He could have 
been sentenced to eight years and one month. Lyons, former 
president of the National Baptist Convention USA, was convicted 
Feb. 27 of swindling $4 million from businesses. He also was found 
guilty of stealing nearly $250,000 donated by the Anti-Defamation 
League of B'nai B'rith to rebuild burned black churches in the

four times more likely to have children with low IQs if the 
disorder is not treated, a study found. The study, published in 
tomorrow's New England Journal of Medicine, found that 19 percent 
of children born to mothers with thyroid deficiency had IQ scores 
of 85 or lower, compared with only 5 percent of those born to 
mothers without such problems. An underactive thyroid can be 
diagnosed with a blood test and treated with medication.

duped the former heavyweight boxing champion into signing away the 
rights to his life story. The lawsuit, filed last Friday in U.S. 
District Court, accused Richard Hirschfeld, a longtime friend as 
well as lawyer of Ali, of taking advantage of Ali's weak condition 
while he was being treated for Parkinson's disease. Ali asked the 
court to declare his 1988 business agreement with Hirschfeld and 
the associate, Ali's former manager and spiritual adviser, Jabir 
Herbert Muhammad of Chicago, null and void.

	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A frail woman who said she didn't mean to  
shoot her daughter was acquitted of attempting to kill the woman 
today. A jury deliberated for seven hours before acquitting 
68-year-old Shirley Egan of attempted murder. Her daughter, 
Georgette Smith, was left paralyzed from the shooting and later 
died when a court granted her permission to end life support. 
Police said Ms. Egan opened fire after hearing her daughter talk

help relief efforts. The international Red Cross launched an 
initial appeal for $6.92 million to assist some 100,000 people 
affected by the quake. The European Union said it was sending $2.1 
million in humanitarian aid and promised to give more later. The 
7.4-magnitude earthquake that struck before dawn Tuesday killed 
3,839 people and injured nearly 18,500, according to a special 
Turkish crisis unit. But many people -- perhaps more than 10,000 --

	Talks on Palestinian Prisoners End

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Talks on freeing jailed Palestinians collapsed  
today, setting back efforts to revive a U.S.-brokered peace accord. 
The talks ended when Israel refused to discuss any changes in its 
criteria for freeing the captives. Negotiators on both sides said 
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak -- like his hard-line predecessor 
Benjamin Netanyahu -- refused to include Palestinians who had been 
involved in violent attacks on Israelis in the prisoner release 
mandated in the U.S.-brokered Wye River accords. Netanyahu froze 
the accords last year with this refusal.

although other serious crimes dropped. The city recorded 57,736 
serious crimes from January through June, a 15.8 percent drop over 
the same period a year ago. The largest drop came in larcenies, 
which were down 25.5 percent, while assaults, auto thefts, 
burglaries, rapes and robberies also declined. Mayor Dennis Archer 
said the increase in murders was baffling -- especially after 
declining in 1998 -- because it had no clear cause and no obvious

such activities as the debate team, choir and marching band. The 
ACLU said the lawsuit is the first in the nation to challenge 
mandatory testing of students who participate in extracurricular 
activities that are tied to their courses during the regular school 
day. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of two 16-year-old high school 
juniors in Tecumseh, 35 miles southeast of Oklahoma City. The suit

<HEADLINE> Expiring Green Cards Frustrate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Every day, hundreds of immigrants line up outside  
the Immigration and Naturalization Service's office, worried their 
green cards will lapse and they will lose their legal status. 
</P>
<P>
	The cards -- the first issued with an expiration date to improve  
security -- start expiring this month. Because the office can only 
process about 1,000 immigrants a day, many wait for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say the anxiety is unnecessary, because no one will  
lose their legal status. The misunderstanding over the cards, many 
say, only exacerbates a chronic problem at the agency -- too few INS 
workers with too little information. 
</P>
<P>
	``Workers here sometimes don't give us the answers we need -- the  
answers we come for,'' said Maria Valencia, a Mexican immigrant who 
was standing in line for forms recently. ``They make us wait and 
then they come out and tell us to go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration officials say those who allow their green cards to  
lapse will not be deported or fined. Leaving the United States on 
an expired green card, however, might cause difficulty trying to 
re-enter. To apply for jobs, immigrants also need a current green 
card, officially called the I-551 Permanent Resident Card. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think that once the green cards expire they are going to  
be undocumented again,'' says Manuel Ventura of Centro Romero, a 
Chicago organization that provides legal services to immigrants. 
``But it's like when the police pull you over and you have an 
expired driver's license, you just have to get it renewed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 600,000 cards are set to expire this year, according to  
INS estimates. On top of that, the agency is trying to cope with a 
backlog of cases that mushroomed when green card caseworkers were 
transferred to process a record number of citizenship requests in 
the mid-1990s, said Judy Mark of the National Immigration Forum, a 
public policy organization in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS introduced the 10-year expiration date in 1989 so cards  
could be updated with more security features to prevent 
counterfeiting. New cards feature a digital photograph and 
fingerprint images on the front, in addition to holograms and an 
optical memory strip encoded with biographical information on the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Angered by the line in Chicago, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill.,  
rebuked the agency for what she calls a lack of ``basic customer 
service.'' Last month she led a rally outside the INS office 
calling for fundamental changes in the way the agency processes 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The notion that they should be subjected to the same  
indignities of the countries from which they came is completely 
unacceptable,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, the INS office also has seen a surge in  
renewals, with about 150 to 200 people a day standing in line, said 
spokesman Rico Cabrera. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS has begun taking applications through the mail.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago office also is printing brochures that let  
immigrants know about a bilingual, toll-free telephone line that 
answers questions, said INS District Director Brian Perryman. 
Renewal forms also can be downloaded from the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Too little, too late, say some standing in the lines.  
</P>
<P>
	``For somebody who knows about the computer, it's very easy,''  
said Martin Reyes, who was checking on the status of his wife's 
renewal. ``But I don't know about the computer and how it works. 
And by telephone it's always busy or there's a recording, always.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Perryman acknowledges the lines will continue to be long.  
</P>
<P>
	``They want to talk to a person about it. And it's ... a process  
of making sure that we give them the right answers,'' he said. 
``Sometimes we don't.''

<HEADLINE> Army Enlists Hollywood's Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Army is enlisting Hollywood and its  
special effects wizardry to create computerized training 
simulations so real that soldiers will start to sweat. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Army signed a deal with the University of  
Southern California to have the school's movie, special-effects and 
other technology experts help with troop training. 
</P>
<P>
	Training programs will include battle scenarios, primers on  
topography and culture of military destinations, and even 
simulations in which troops en route to combat zones might wear 
virtual-reality helmets to train for an upcoming mission, 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Secretary Louis Caldera said the military is seeking  
programs with ``very real story and character content.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera and university president Steven Sample signed the  
five-year, $44.3 million contract deal at the school, which is 
using the money to create the Institute for Creative Technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers hope to enlist the help of movie studios and other  
entertainment companies, though none have signed on yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Military simulations lag behind the commercial technology the  
entertainment industry uses to create special effects and 
computer-generated characters, said Elliott Mattlage, who works on 
a military simulation program for defense contractor Lockheed 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has developed a system for the military that allows  
soldiers to punch up images of potential combat zones around the 
world. The simulator measures about 6 feet by 4 feet, but 
entertainment technology might help reduce the size, said Jeffery 
Hovious, manager of business development for Lockheed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to shrink it further and get it down to the Dick  
Tracy wristwatch,'' Hovious said. ``Working with Hollywood, 
there'll be cross-pollination of technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The military also hopes the Hollywood connection will help  
script more engaging, true-to-life story lines, giving troops a 
better feel for the real-life situations they encounter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got training programs now that are more like video  
games,'' Staff Sgt. Danny Quimpo said. ``The soldiers really enjoy 
that more, and it augments the training and probably makes them a 
little bit more confident going in.''

<HEADLINE> Honda To Recall 115,000 Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Honda Motor Co. will recall 114,913 cars exported  
from Japan, including about 95,000 Acuras in the United States, to 
replace potentially defective transmission bolts that can become 
disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States and Canada, the recall affects some 1996-99  
model-year Acura RLs and some 1996-98 Acura 3.2 TLs, Honda 
spokesman Andy Boyd said Wednesday. Honda did not say how many of 
the Acuras are being recalled in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, where the cars are sold as the Honda Legend, Inspire  
and Saber, 29,060 vehicles are being recalled for the same reason. 
Additional cars are being recalled in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda will notify owners of the cars in the United States by  
mail starting at the end of this month, Boyd said. Dealers will 
replace the differential sealing bolts that connect with drive axle 
and the differential, the set of gears that allows more power to go 
to one wheel than the other in a turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyd said no accidents or injuries have been reported as a  
result of the defect. In most cases, the axle and differential 
became disconnected and the car would not move. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda did not say how much the recall will cost.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United  
States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 16  
</P>
<P>
	Colby (Kan.) Free Press, on Columbine back-to-school rally:  
</P>
<P>
	Columbine High School at Littleton, Colo., reopened for a new  
school year Monday. The way it opened, however, left a sour taste 
in our mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	Long lines of parents and alumni and others cheered the more  
than 2,000 students and faculty as they made their way to the 
school's doorways, replete with full blown media coverage, and 
capped off with a pep rally. 
</P>
<P>
	They came back to reclaim Columbine High School.  
</P>
<P>
	The student body president whipped up the crowd, and the  
principal emphasized, in so many words, that there will be zero 
tolerance for all the things that led to the tragedy at the school. 
To which we must ask: Why did it take such a tragedy to finally 
determine the zero tolerances that won't now be tolerated? ... 
</P>
<P>
	It would have been better had Columbine High opened the new  
school year on a note of deference to those who won't be returning 
as a result of the tragedy. Yes, there could have been smiles, and 
hugs, on that first day, without the fanfare, and what appeared to 
be the in-your-face attitude that is so much a reason for some of 
the discontent and unrest we see in our schools today. ... 
</P>
<P>
	All those associated with Columbine High School should have  
reclaimed it with an air of dignity. Leave the pep rally to the 
athletic sector. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 15  
</P>
<P>
	The News-Journal of Daytona Beach, Fla., on creating schools  
free of fear and violence: 
</P>
<P>
	It's grimly ironic that even as the sounds of gunfire continue  
to stun communities throughout the nation, the danger to children 
in schools is actually diminishing. While it's important to make 
schools as safe as possible from potential violence, it's equally 
important to avoid overreacting in ways that turn schools into 
maximum-security institutions and their students into virtual 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline in violence at Florida's public school campuses has  
been dramatic. During the last four years, state education 
officials project a 36 percent drop in incidents involving weapons, 
including knives and guns. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The statewide decline is particularly impressive in the face of  
rapidly increasing student populations. Much of the change can be 
attributed to zero-tolerance policies at many schools and programs 
that are picking up signs of dangerous behavior before violence 
breaks out. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 15  
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles Times, on gun control:  
</P>
<P>
	Next month Congress is scheduled to consider a proposal to  
require the same background checks on buyers at gun shows as are 
required now for buyers at gun stores. That would be a modest but 
important step toward keeping legally purchased guns out of the 
hands of people with criminal records. 
</P>
<P>
	But as usual, given Congress' craven kowtowing to the gun lobby,  
the measure's fate is uncertain. What would help is some offsetting 
political pressure on the House and Senate, and the president of 
the U.S. Conference of Mayors has a good idea about how to apply 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's Wellington Webb is urging his fellow mayors and the  
nation's police chiefs to march on Washington next month to insist 
that Congress enact tougher gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's assault rifle attack that wounded four children and  
an adult at the North Valley Jewish Community Center (in Los 
Angeles) and the racially motivated murder almost immediately 
afterward of a Filipino-American postal employee produced the 
latest victims in a national epidemic of gun violence that persists 
despite an overall decline in crime. ... 
</P>
<P>
	For the National Rifle Association and its political toadies to  
go on pretending that effective measures to reduce this violence 
are beyond devising is absurd. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 13  
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times, on gun limits:  
</P>
<P>
	The shooting madness in Los Angeles is another inexplicable  
crime where the only common thread is guns and ammunition and their 
demented use on innocent human beings. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistical drops in gun violence are no balm for the creepy  
perception that weird, almost weekly assaults are happening because 
the wrong people have easy access to weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The settings may vary, but the perpetrators share the same  
murderous disaffection from society that allows them to believe 
they must act out their inner rage in public, armed to the teeth. 
...
</P>
<P>
	While everyone sorts out the motives and tries to imagine how  
the troubled can be identified, helped or locked up, the common 
denominator is guns. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Our culture is awash in guns, All of the old shibboleths are  
wearing thin with a weary, frightened society. No one is seriously 
proposing taking rifles away from hunters, denying collectors their 
hobby or preventing homeowners from having the security they 
believe comes with a handgun in the bedside table. ... 
</P>
<P>
	A test of allegiances is coming, a test of power. Politicians  
must decide if they will continue to respond to the financial 
firepower of the National Rifle Association or heed legions of 
scared voters whose recourse is ballots not bullets. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 17  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Times, Farmington, N.M., on HMO compromise:  
</P>
<P>
	It's something of a miracle.  
</P>
<P>
	Both Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. House got together  
and actually reached a compromise on an important issue -- HMOs and 
the rights of patients. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of partisan bickering while important issues fell to  
the sideline or were adopted or killed along party lines, it's 
refreshing that some work can be accomplished by those on both 
sides of the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
	What's even more astonishing is President Clinton lauded the  
plan, saying it would provide needed protections for all Americans. 
...
</P>
<P>
	Now the measure will go to the Senate, where it will more than  
likely be dissected or never heard from again. 
</P>
<P>
	But regardless of whether this particular bill makes it to the  
president's desk for his signature, the mere fact that both parties 
were able to come up with a compromise is encouraging. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 11  
</P>
<P>
	The Sun News, Myrtle Beach, S.C., on NAACP boycott:  
</P>
<P>
	The controversial and nontraditional Confederate ``battle flag''  
on the Statehouse dome has become much more expensive than the 
basic cost of a piece of cloth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grand Strand has lost at least two conventions or meetings,  
and six other groups have become somewhat doubtful. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Is the heritage of the battle flag, which is actually the  
Confederate naval jack, not the battle flag at all, worth all the 
economic losses to our historic, growing state? We do not think so, 
and we urge the state government to move in concert with the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to reach 
a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	That consensus would take down the battle flag from the dome,  
hoist it at a Confederate memorial on the Statehouse grounds, 
protect other Confederate monuments in the state and declare the 
right of individuals to fly the so-called battle flag at their 
homes. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 17  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Oklahoman, Oklahoma City, on candidate questions:  
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush is starting to catch the flack  
normally directed at the front-runner for a party's presidential 
nomination. Most nettlesome are questions from reporters and 
Republican rivals concerning Bush's past personal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush admits he once had a problem with alcohol but refuses to  
say whether he ever used illegal drugs. His reluctance is 
understandable; if he answers one personal question, 10 more likely 
would be raised. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet to questions concerning past drug use, Bush should respond.  
Voters are entitled to either a flat denial or a contrite admission 
-- which, recent history suggests, Americans surely would accept 
with forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug question will not just go away. Bush should deal with  
it now. The alternative is to see the issue surface deeper into the 
campaign, where the potential political impact will be much 
greater. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 16  
</P>
<P>
	The Clarksburg (W.Va.) Exponent-Telegram, on school clothes:  
</P>
<P>
	Maybe school uniforms aren't such a bad idea after all.  
</P>
<P>
	Teens and pre-teens throughout the country are currently  
enjoying those final, precious days of freedom before heading back 
to the education grind. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, more than a few are spending their -- or  
perhaps more likely, their parents' -- hard-earned cash to buy the 
latest in back-to-school fashions. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, the ``industrial'' look is big this year. For those  
of you who are out of your teen years and don't have children, the 
fashion trend includes heavy work shirts and jeans that give the 
impression of being worn and dirty. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It's all crazy, but all of us can understand it to a certain  
degree. After all, school years represent a time when we all 
experience the most insecurity and least confidence about 
ourselves; the approval and acceptance of our peers is the most 
important thing in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But let's realize that the reason we go to school is to get an  
education. In the long run, it usually turns out to be more 
important than what our friends thought of our clothes. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 15  
</P>
<P>
	Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal, on Kansas Board of Education:  
</P>
<P>
	Kansas is mostly flat, and the Kansas Board of Education may  
next announce that the rest of the Earth is flat as well. The 
elected state board of education warmed up for that possibility by 
last week ordering all reference to Darwin and evolution removed 
from the state's science curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of education's wrongheaded decision hoists warning  
flags for other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Kansas Board of Education is elected, religious  
conservatives have been able to target and win enough seats for a 
6-4 vote in favor of ignoring scientific evidence that supports the 
theory of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	As Kansas has discovered, all board members should be appointed  
by and answerable to the governor. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 18  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Telegraph, London, on Russian politics:  
</P>
<P>
	As Russia's parliamentary elections approach, anti-Yeltsin  
forces are coalescing. This month, Yuri Luzhkov, the mayor of 
Moscow and a potential presidential candidate, formed an alliance 
with a handful of regional governors in an attempt to increase his 
appeal beyond the confines of the capital. Yesterday, that 
alliance, known as Fatherland-All Russia, was joined by Yevgeny 
Primakov, former head of government and front-runner in the opinion 
polls since February. On the day that Boris Yeltsin was singing the 
praises of Vladimir Putin, his latest choice as prime minister, Mr. 
Primakov trumped the president's card by re-entering the political 
fray. The battle for the succession is on, and the tide is not 
flowing Mr. Yeltsin's way. Indeed, his endorsement of Mr. Putin 
appears to be galvanising his opponents. Their immediate goal is to 
win the parliamentary poll on December 19. With Messrs Primakov and 
Luzhkov at the head of the Fatherland-All Russia list, the centrist 
alliance could even dislodge the Communists as the dominant party 
in the Duma. If it does, what happens then? ... 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 16  
</P>
<P>
	The Courier-Mail, Brisbane, Australia, on Boris Yeltsin:  
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin has turned his country's politics into a  
mixture of high drama and low farce. His erratic behavior, drunken 
lapses and public clowning have made him the buffoon of the world 
stage. The tragedy is that he has betrayed his early promise and 
his achievements as founder of Russian democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin no longer has his nation's best interests at heart -- he  
is primarily concerned with protecting his family and business 
cronies who fear retribution if political enemies win next year's 
presidential elections. Yeltsin is now pinning his hopes on Putin. 
</P>
<P>
	The country is in a mess -- the economy shrank by more than 4  
percent last year and is less than half the size it was in 1991. 
Many Russians are either unemployed or working in unpaid jobs. The 
country needs firm and responsible leadership, but with Yeltsin in 
charge this appears a remote prospect. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 17  
</P>
<P>
	Le Matin, Lausanne, Switzerland, on Russia's new prime minister:  
</P>
<P>
	It's done. Vladimir Putin has received the approval of the Duma  
in the post of prime minister. The man to whom Boris Yeltsin has 
promised the top post of all in June 2000 is in place to lead 
Russia along the tortuous roads which await it, and in particular 
the one which is attracting all the attention, the conflict in 
Dagestan. In his investiture speech, Putin recalled that the 
``territorial integrity of Russia could not be questioned.'' 
Basically, all means will be used to restore order in the rebel 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, from inside the Kremlin, Boris Yeltsin was allowing  
himself a little self-satisfaction: his heart is fine, his back is 
fine and there is no question of decreeing a state of emergency. 
Plenty of reason to worry then, for in the Russian capital there 
has long been a maxim: when the president announces one thing, you 
should expect the opposite in the following days or weeks. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 17  
</P>
<P>
	Goteborgs-Posten, Goteborg, Sweden, on Kashmir conflict:  
</P>
<P>
	It is urgent to finally try to create a lasting, mutually  
accepted border and political guarantees that prevent new fights 
from suddenly erupting. 
</P>
<P>
	Incidents such as the recent downing of a Pakistani surveillance  
plane in an insufficiently mapped area could become the spark that 
fires a rapidly escalating war. If either side in such a situation 
felt it was inferior, it would be tempting to use the most extreme 
fighting tool -- nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	In the long term, it's unsustainable to have a situation where  
the United States and other powers repeatedly are forced to calm 
things down to prevent a disastrous war. Unfortunately, experience 
demonstrates that neither side is willing to launch new 
trust-creating measures in the military arena. While awaiting 
negotiations on the main issues of the conflict, such activities 
would be a very constructive first step toward a greatly desired 
de-escalation. Disturbingly, no real progress is expected before 
next month's parliamentary elections in India. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 18  
</P>
<P>
	Le Figaro, Paris, on Saddam Hussein:  
</P>
<P>
	Since December 1998, the Americans and British have been  
conducting the war alone. ... Why this stubbornness? Why condemn a 
people to go through misery and tolerate the hold onto power of 
Saddam? 
</P>
<P>
	... Today, Paris questions itself about the legitimacy of the  
strategy of Washington and London. The government even has 
expressed its `uneasiness,' estimating that it is necessary to 
establish a `change of logic,' and re-establish `cooperation' with 
Iraq, since the situation is `as bad as it gets.' 
</P>
<P>
	The current embargo, as is said in Paris, is `unjust and cruel.'  
Child mortality has doubled within ten years, Saddam Hussein has 
consolidated his power. Finally, there are no U.N. inspectors left 
with the mission of disarmament, so that Iraq could rearm, while 
profiting from this current vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, to get out of this dead-end, France proposes a  
total lifting of the oil embargo, along with strict financial 
control, and the deployment of a renewed, ` independent and 
professionalized' commission of experts, and not uniquely composed 
of intelligence agents. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 15  
</P>
<P>
	The Nation, Bangkok, Thailand, on French workweek:  
</P>
<P>
	Many of France's workers, already some of the least physically  
taxed in the world, will likely find their employers making even 
fewer demands on their time. If a government-authored draft bill 
passes parliament as it should, French workers will not be allowed 
to work more than 35 hours a week, or 1,600 hours a year. That 
works out to about forty 40-hour weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In reality, the modern work place, despite all its machinery and  
technology, is becoming more demanding of workers' time, not less. 
In the industries that are quickly forming the main pillars of the 
much heralded `new economy' -- IT, media organizations and financial 
services -- long hours are de rigeur. 
</P>
<P>
	France's inability to attract foreign investment in these  
industries says much about the course it has chosen. In many ways, 
that is too bad. Work may be good for the soul, but too much of it 
wears out our bodies and dispirits our minds. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be good for all workers if France could pull it off, if  
it can create more jobs while its workers have more time to live. 
Sadly, that is unlikely to be the case. Somebody else in the world 
wants that job and is willing to work longer and harder at it -- 
even if it is only so they can have a new fridge or set of wheels.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down, Gold Up in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The U.S. dollar fell in European trading today,  
sinking to its lowest level against the Japanese yen since 
February. Gold rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0548 in late European trading, up from  
$1.0502 Tuesday. Later, in midday trading in New York, the euro 
traded at $1.0506. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose above 124 yen in May, but the Japanese currency  
has steadily regained lost ground. Today, the dollar slumped from 
113.07 at midday to 111.70 by midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has been boosted by bullish Japanese economic data --  
industrial output up 3.2 percent and machinery orders up 6.3 
percent in June, and first-quarter growth revised upward from 1.9 
percent to 2.0 percent. The market also expects that a fiscal 
stimulus package will push Japanese government bond yields above 2 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dollar/yen seldom goes in a straight line,'' said Claudio  
Piron, treasury economist at Standard Chartered Bank in London. 
``We expect it to reach 110 yen, but it will be a bumpy ride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday,  
included 111.70 Japanese yen, down from 114.33; 1.5160 Swiss 
francs, down from 1.5239; 1.4838 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4758. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound was quoted at $1.6060, down from $1.5976.  
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading in New York, the dollar bought 112.26 yen, and  
the pond was worth $1.600. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Staples To Open Stores in Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Staples Inc., which sells everything from pencils  
to PCs, now plans to begin offering office supplies to travelers at 
airports, the company announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	By putting outlets at the airport, marketing experts say Staples  
gives itself access to a captive market of shoppers with time on 
their hands and money to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great thing about the airport is that you have nothing  
else to do,'' said David Bell, a professor of marketing at Harvard 
Business School. ``If you're in Chicago on a two-hour layover, 
you've spent $300 on a flight; I think the purse strings are a 
little looser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Staples' first airport store is scheduled to open in September  
in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	It will offer a traditional retail environment, as well as a  
computer that will let shoppers buy products from Staples' Web site 
or order through a direct phone line to a Staples catalog 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers will also be able to order supplies and have them  
delivered to their destination, home or office. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Framingham-based company expects self-service copy and  
fax machines to be popular with the business travelers it says make 
up 50 percent of the clientele at Philadelphia International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport retailing has been on the rise in recent years, a trend  
Babson College marketing professor Kathleen Seiders attributed in 
part to increasing numbers of travelers and decreasing numbers of 
shoppers at traditional malls. 
</P>
<P>
	``The airports are much fuller. The opportunities for retailers  
have increased,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also noted that the rise of women in the workplace has led  
to a decline in the number of recreational shoppers at malls. With 
fewer people spending their days at the malls, more people are 
buying on the go. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these shopping behavior factors really encourage the  
development of airport retailing,'' she said. ``When you can offer 
all these chain stores that people would find in a mall in an 
airport, the appeal is very high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies selling their wares at airports include the Gap  
and the Body Shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Vassalluzzo, president of Staples' realty and development  
arm, said Staples plans to open stores in two other airports by the 
end of the year, but he declined to specify where.

<HEADLINE> Woods, Garcia To Renew Duel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASTLE ROCK, Colo. (AP) -- Even with a new young gun in town who  
has challenged his dominance of the game and stolen his galleries, 
Tiger Woods likes his chances in the Sprint International. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those weeks that I can thoroughly enjoy because  
you can stretch it out there,'' Woods said after Wednesday's 
pro-am. ``You can be aggressive. In fact, you have to be 
aggressive. You have to get birdies and hopefully a few eagles 
along the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The long-hitting Woods is even longer at Castle Pines Golf  
Club's 6,200-foot elevation, having uncorked a 403-yard drive in 
his first International last year, when he finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	With his ability to make a lot of birdies, he looms as a  
favorite, since birdies are rewarded under the modified Stableford 
scoring system used in this 14-year-old event. 
</P>
<P>
	A player gets 5 points for an eagle, 2 for birdie, 0 for par,  
minus-1 for bogey and minus-3 for double bogey or worse. 
</P>
<P>
	When the event begins today, Woods, just 23 and in only his  
third full season on the PGA Tour, will have to fend off the threat 
of an even younger player. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods staged a riveting duel with 19-year-old Sergio Garcia in  
the final round of the PGA championship on Sunday, edging the 
swashbuckling Spaniard by one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was bound to happen,'' Woods said Wednesday with a laugh  
and without a trace of wistfulness. ``You can't be the young guy on 
the block forever. I welcome that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, who got his driver's license just last month, ranks only  
31st in the world because of having played a limited number of 
tournaments. But his performance last week -- he was the youngest 
runner-up in PGA championship history -- clinched a berth on the 
1999 European Ryder Cup team and galvanized the sport as no one has 
since, well, Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Drawing a reaction usually reserved for rock stars, Garcia was  
mobbed by autograph seekers -- most of them kids -- after Tuesday's 
practice round here and again before Wednesday's pro-am. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an extension of the gallery support he received on Sunday  
at Medinah, when the crowd became more pro-Garcia than pro-Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it was the largest crowd I have played in  
front of,'' Garcia said, ``but it was one of the best. A crowd has 
never pushed me and helped me as much as they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, asked if Garcia's sudden popularity will relieve some of  
the pressure that has been on him since 1996, said, ``No doubt 
about it. Now, he is getting the galleries and the attention, the 
media coverage. When I first came out, it was very tough to focus 
on golf and budget your time with all the demands on it. David 
(Duval) went through the same thing. Now Sergio is starting to find 
that out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, meanwhile, was still adjusting to Castle Pines'  
6,200-foot elevation, which causes shots to fly 10-15 percent 
farther than at sea level. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last week I was hitting a 3-wood about 260 yards,'' Garcia  
said. ``Today I hit a 3-iron that went 280 almost. I'm sure I am 
going to hit some shots over the green. We're not used to playing 
here, but it will probably affect me a little more because it is my 
first time playing here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The event features eight of the world's top 10 players,  
including No. 1 Woods, No. 2 David Duval and No. 3 Davis Love III. 
</P>
<P>
	Also contending are fifth-ranked Lee Westwood; No. 6 Vijay  
Singh, the defending champion; No. 8 Ernie Els; No. 9 Mark O'Meara 
and No. 10 Nick Price.

<HEADLINE> Jamaican Athlete May Have Used Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Jamaicans reacted with disbelief  
Wednesday at reports that Merlene Ottey tested positive for using 
steroids, and government officials came to her defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Ottey withdrew from the World Championships in  
Seville, Spain, after traces of the steroid Nandrolone were found 
in her system in an initial A test. If the B sample test returns 
positive, she will probably be suspended for two years, effectively 
ending her career. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamaican Sport and Labor Minister Portia Simpson-Miller on  
Wednesday called for a retest and said she fully supported Ottey. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey's performance is ``just the sheer strength, courage and  
determination of a Jamaican woman who is on track in any event and 
saying I am the best by any test,'' Simpson-Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Callers to various Jamaican radio talk-shows expressed shock at  
the report, many claiming it to be a conspiracy on the part of the 
International Amateur Athletic Federation or a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Prime Minister Seymour Mullings said the country was  
``sticking by Merlene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herb McKenley, a member of Jamaica's gold medal-winning 400  
meter relay team at the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, expressed 
``shock and horror'' at the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Paul Wright, who has acted as team physician for several  
Jamaican track teams, says the report has been devastating. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always held Merlene as an icon, a drug-free track  
queen,'' said Wright. ``Now that's all crumbled to dust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with West Indies cricket fastbowler Courtney Walsh, Ottey  
is the most popular sports personality in Jamaica. The country 
comes to a standstill when she competes at major meets such as the 
Olympics and the World Championships.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Trade Outfielder to A's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Oakland Athletics, looking for help since Tony  
Phillips broke his leg and was lost for the season, obtained 
outfielder Rich Becker from the Milwaukee Brewers on Wednesday for 
a player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker hit .252 with five home runs and 16 RBIs in 89 games for  
the Brewers. He had a .395 on-base percentage, and was safe on all 
five of his stolen base attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker, 27, signed with the Brewers as a free agent in January.  
He also has played for Minnesota, the New York Mets and Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland began the day one game behind Boston in the AL wild-card  
race. The Athletics played at Fenway Park on Wednesday and 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another piece of our puzzle,'' Oakland manager Art Howe  
said. ``He's going to help us out in a critical situation in center 
field. He's a quality player and does a great job against 
right-handed pitching, and that's why we acquired him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There had been rumors Oakland was trying to make a trade for New  
York Yankees outfielder Chad Curtis. Teams must complete deals by 
Aug. 31 in order for new players to be eligible for the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips broke his leg trying to break up a double play Sunday  
at Toronto. The 40-year-old leadoff man was hitting .244 with 15 
home runs and 49 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee recalled first baseman Kevin Barker from Triple-A  
Louisville to take Becker's roster spot.

<HEADLINE> New Rabbit Discovered in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Biologists have discovered a previously unknown species of  
rabbit in the forested mountains between Laos and Vietnam, an 
animal with short ears, short tail, yellowish fur with black 
stripes on the back and a red rump. 
</P>
<P>
	Details on the Annamite rabbit, named after the mountain range,  
are reported in today's issue of the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Timmins, a British naturalist working at the time for the  
Wildlife Conservation Society based in New York, spotted the first 
specimen of the rabbit for sale at a meat market in Laos in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have never encountered the rabbit alive, but one was  
caught on film by a camera rigged to photograph passing animals in 
a nature reserve across the border in Vietnam in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to be very shy, very elusive,'' Timmins said. It is  
not known how many rabbits there are. 
</P>
<P>
	The Annamite rabbit looks very similar to a species found on the  
Indonesian island of Sumatra, so it was not clear at first that it 
was a new species. 
</P>
<P>
	But DNA analysis revealed considerable genetic differences  
between the two, said Diana Bell, a biologist specializing in 
rabbits at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, Britain, who 
is part of the team that reported the finding. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNA indicates that the two species diverged around 8 million  
years ago, when Sumatra was connected to the Asian mainland, Bell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other large mammals have been discovered in Vietnam and the  
surrounding countries in the last decade as biologists have started 
exploring a little-studied area.

<HEADLINE> Neo-Nazis Cancel Idaho Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- The neo-Nazi group Aryan Nations has  
canceled its planned Labor Day weekend march through downtown 
because of the attack on a Los Angeles Jewish center. 
</P>
<P>
	The city had granted the group a parade permit for Sept. 4, but  
Richard Butler, founder of the white supremacist sect, delivered a 
letter to the city clerk's office Tuesday canceling the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``In view of the tragedy that has occurred in Los Angeles and  
the attempt of various media to link Buford Furrow to our church, 
we feel it would be unseemly to host a march at this time,'' Butler 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow, a former Aryan Nations security guard, is charged with  
murder and attempted murder in the Aug. 10 killing of a postman and 
wounding of five people at the North Valley Jewish Community Center 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aryan Nations is the political arm of Butler's Church of  
Jesus Christ-Christian, a ``Christian Identity'' sect that promotes 
anti-Semitism and racial separation. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials, facing the prospect of a third Aryan event this  
summer and the potential for large crowds of protesters in light of 
the Los Angeles shootings, were pleased with Butler's announcement, 
Mayor Steve Judy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aryan supporters and human rights demonstrators clashed in a  
city park July 3. A July 10 march by the group was cut short when 
opponents sat in the middle of the city's main street, forcing the 
Aryans to take a detour.

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Ignoring Straw Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Top Republican presidential candidates  
are ignoring Alabama's first GOP straw poll next week, despite its 
billing as the initial test of their strength in the South, and the 
state party's director is fuming. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are they telling Southerners, `You are not good  
enough'?'' Alabama GOP director Chris Neeley said. ``I just don't 
see how they can snub the South.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of Iowa's straw poll, only one candidate has  
agreed to attend the Aug. 28 event in Birmingham: radio talk show 
host Alan Keyes, a former interim president of Alabama A&AMP;M 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes' campaign notified the state GOP of his intentions  
Wednesday. Neeley said Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah is also a possible 
participant. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the Iowa straw poll last Saturday, several  
candidates said they weren't coming to Alabama, including Texas 
Gov. George W. Bush, former American Red Cross President Elizabeth 
Dole, publisher Steve Forbes, former Vice President Dan Quayle, 
Arizona Sen. John McCain, conservative activist Gary Bauer and 
commentator Pat Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	Some said the nonbinding poll was too hastily arranged last  
spring or didn't fit their campaign strategy. Alabama's primary is 
not until June 6, late in the nomination process, and few 
candidates see it as a place that warrants their time or money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to do any more straw polls,'' Mrs. Dole's  
deputy press secretary, Chris Hawes, said Wednesday. ``What we 
found, as far as straw polls in general, it's just not the most 
efficient way to campaign. I think we owe the people who send us 
money a little more than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Bush aide said the Texas governor plans to campaign in South  
Carolina and Georgia in the days before the Alabama straw poll and 
then spend time with his family in Texas on Aug. 28. A Forbes' 
campaign spokesman said Forbes would not attend because he 
previously scheduled a vacation with his daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all due respect to the Alabama party, it was put together  
late and the rules were convoluted, at best,'' said Buchanan 
spokesman Bob Adams. ``If they had done it and announced it two or 
three years out, there might have been an opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers of the Alabama GOP's first straw poll have said that,  
unlike Iowa, where each candidate was allowed to buy tickets for 
thousands of supporters to vote as delegates, some candidates could 
be shying away from a contest that limits each one to handing out 
100 tickets among the more than 2,000 votes that will be cast. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegates to the straw poll in Birmingham qualified by  
paying a $15 fee at county conventions in June. They are paying 
another $35 to qualify for Aug. 28 and organizers predict the straw 
poll, if it does little else, will generate $200,000 for the party. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Alabama political analyst William Stewart said the  
candidates' decisions to ignore the straw poll would not likely 
have any regional impact. And he said that without in-person 
campaigning by the candidates, the winner of the poll would gain 
little from a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the straw poll would still ``make money for the  
party and hopefully generate some enthusiasm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neeley said planning for the straw poll has ``helped us build up  
our grass roots. We signed up at least 3,000 new activists'' who 
will be precinct workers, poll watchers and helping with our voter 
registration. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's spokesman said the straw polls in general ``are the  
kind of thing where if you win them you promote it and if you don't 
do so hot you downplay it. ... They probably have less credibility 
than your average poll. But they sure are a lot of fun for party 
activists.''

</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- William Becker, a longtime civil rights  
organizer and activist, died Aug. 6 from injuries suffered in a car 
accident. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker headed San Francisco's Human Rights Commission for eight  
years. He later became deputy director of the California Department 
of Industrial Welfare, where he worked until his 1982 retirement. 
</P>

<P>
	Palmer found that children enjoyed watching other children and  
animals, loved music and slapstick, wanted characters to be kind to

<HEADLINE> Calif. Said More Prepared for Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Far fewer people would die if an earthquake  
like the one that struck Turkey were to rock urban Southern 
California or the San Francisco Bay area, experts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advanced construction techniques and strict building codes  
should prevent a disaster like the one visited on Turkey, according 
to experts. As many as 4,000 people may have died and tens of 
thousands are injured or missing in the aftermath of Tuesday's 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Many buildings that collapsed in the magnitude-7.4 quake may not  
have adhered to standards such as those in force in much of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be somewhat better off but not complacent,'' said  
Lucy Jones, chief scientist for the U.S. Geological Survey in 
Southern California. ``Even though we have modern construction, we 
have older buildings too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California's modern earthquake safety law was enacted following  
the 1933 Long Beach quake that killed 120 people. It has been 
updated with subsequent quakes, particularly the 1971 San Fernando 
shaker that left 65 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1994 Northridge quake, the city of Los Angeles  
instituted tougher inspections of steel-frame high-rises after 
welds in some buildings cracked during the shaking. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some warn that urban California has never sustained a  
direct hit by a strong quake. The strongest shaking in the 
Northridge and 1989 Loma Prieta quakes occurred far from populated 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're right up within a mile of a really big fault, you  
have really big motions,'' Ms. Jones said. ``That level of movement 
hasn't been incorporated into the building codes. How bad will it 
be? We really don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In California, older buildings, particularly those constructed  
of unreinforced brick, pose the biggest threat, said Ron Hamburger, 
senior vice president of the risk consulting firm EQE 
International. 
</P>
<P>
	A magnitude-7.0 quake on the Hayward Fault, east of San  
Francisco, could result in a death toll in the low thousands and 
cause $50 billion in damage, he said. A similar quake in the more 
densely populated Los Angeles Basin also could kill thousands and 
cause up to $250 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In Turkey, nearly 3,900 people are known dead, 18,500 were  
injured and more than 10,000 were still missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The fallout of such a strong quake in California would vary  
depending on a number of factors, including when the tremor hits, 
Ms. Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	A nighttime earthquake in California would lead to fewer losses  
than a daytime quake because residents tend to live in flexible, 
wood-frame homes, not the concrete apartment high-rises common in 
Turkey. Californians also are less likely to be working inside the 
most dangerous buildings at night. 
</P>
<P>
	In Istanbul, contractors have made a killing by throwing up  
slapdash, concrete-and-cinderblock apartment blocks to house 
millions of rural Turks looking for work. When the earthquake hit, 
many of the cheaply made, never-inspected housing blocks pancaked 
into the ground, crushing thousands as they slept. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the region has suffered several quakes over the past  
decade, experts say little has been done to address the problems of 
contractors who don't bother with permits and skimp on materials, 
or corrupt officials who don't enforce building codes. 
</P>
<P>
	Code enforcement is also an issue in California, said Jim  
Slosson, former state geologist and former commissioner of the 
Seismic Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Many buildings that collapsed in Northridge, for example, were  
found to have been defective -- with bad welds, improper braces or 
the wrong-size nails. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd be very foolish to think that this is only an issue in  
Turkey,'' Ms. Jones said. ``If you skimp, it might not matter in 
the first few years. But as nails rust, you have less of a buffer. 
Then the skimping makes more of a difference.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Thompson Endorses McCain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John  
McCain told veterans Wednesday that U.S. military forces are 
``perilously close to the breaking point'' because of declining 
defense budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost 100,000 Americans are serving overseas in an  
unprecedented number of contingency, peacekeeping and humanitarian 
operations,'' the Arizona senator said at the annual convention of 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain criticized both the Clinton administration and Congress  
on defense issues and also picked up a presidential endorsement 
from Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, who had backed Lamar 
Alexander until the former Tennessee governor withdrew from the 
race Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes to reforming the way Washington does business,  
John McCain is a leader,'' Thompson said. ``In his personal courage 
and integrity, John McCain has shown characteristics of leadership 
like nobody I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a 25-minute speech focusing on security, veterans issues,  
military readiness and China policy, McCain criticized Congress for 
failing to close defense bases and said Kosovo should not be a 
model for future military challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	He said some military units were unfit for deployment because of  
recruiting and retention problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``After six years of severely underfunding the military, the  
president reversed himself and proposed increasing the defense 
budget,'' said McCain, a Navy fighter pilot during the Vietnam War 
who spent nearly six years as a prisoner of war. ``Once again, 
however, his rhetoric far exceeded his actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton addressed the convention Monday and called for VFW  
support to push Congress for full support of his foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said the United States should encourage political change  
in China and that the Clinton administration should ``change its 
failed policy of pressuring only Taiwan to avoid open 
hostilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who received a standing ovation from VFW delegates at  
the end of his speech, called for a veterans' bill of rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of the promises of benefits that were made or implied to  
active duty personnel and to us veterans have been ignored, changed 
or abandoned over the years,'' he said. ``This primarily is true in 
the area of veterans' health-care benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference after his speech, McCain said closing  
unneeded military bases would save about $4 billion a year, and he 
called for canceling the Navy's Seawolf submarine, which costs 
about $4 billion each. 
</P>
<P>
	In May the Senate rejected a move by McCain and Sen. Carl Levin,  
D-Mich., to authorize a new round of base closings in 2001 as part 
of the defense spending bill for the fiscal year that begins Oct 1.

<HEADLINE> Delta, Pilots Discuss New Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines and its pilot union have begun  
negotiations to try to set a pay scale for a new airplane, the 
Boeing 767-400. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta expects the new 287-seat domestic widebodies to be  
delivered in May 2000. The plane, currently under development, is 
Boeing's longest and widest 767. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based airline had ordered 777s, but in April  
postponed delivery of the popular international jet after talks 
with the pilots union over new pay rates fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new talks that began Tuesday, Delta's opening offer would  
pay 767-400 captains $208 an hour in base pay, or about $195,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Line Pilots Association said that hourly rate is only 18  
cents above the current top rate for domestic DC-10 captains at 
American Airlines. The union did not present its opening demand 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Cards' Benes Set for Sept. Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Alan Benes, out  
more than two years with shoulder woes, said Wednesday he's on 
schedule for a September return. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long time since I could say I'm 100 percent  
confident that I'm going to pitch here, and at this point I can say 
that,'' Benes said. ``After my last start I kind of solidified 
everything for me. Being able to go out and throw and feel as good 
as I did, it feels great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benes threw 2 1-3 innings in his first rehab start for Triple-A  
Memphis, allowing one hit and throwing 34 pitches. The plan calls 
for him to make three more starts, Friday, Aug. 25 and Aug. 30, and 
then join the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Benes, 27, was one of the NL's most promising pitchers when he  
was injured in July 1997. He was 9-9 that year with a 2.89 ERA 
after going 13-10 as a rookie, but has had two operations since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he's been a starter all his career and is starting for  
Memphis, Benes probably will pitch out of the bullpen in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Benes is one of three starters out for the season. Matt Morris  
had elbow ligament surgery in April and Donovan Osborne had 
shoulder surgery in May. Morris began throwing lightly earlier this 
week and is hopeful of being ready by spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Cardinals pitcher, Garrett Stephenson, escaped serious  
injury Tuesday after he took a line drive from Mike Lieberthal off 
his left wrist. Stephenson had to leave the game after 3 2-3 
innings and had a seam imprint on his wrist on Wednesday, but 
wasn't expected to miss a start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel that lucky,'' said Stephenson, 3-0 with a 3.49  
ERA. ``As long as it's not broken it'll be fine, but it's real 
sore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the Cardinals had originally feared it would be much  
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boy, it was scary,'' pitching coach Dave Duncan said. ``You  
could see the lump all the way from the dugout. I thought, `Oh man, 
he's got a broken wrist.''' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Cardinals are undecided whether to call up 20-year-old  
phenom Rick Ankiel, 6-3 with a 3.39 ERA at Memphis, for the final 
month of the season. ``We just want to let him get a little more 
experience,'' general manager Walt Jocketty said. ``He's still 
struggling from time to time. We have not made a decision one way 
or another.'' Ankiel has 110 strikeouts in 82 1-3 innings.

<HEADLINE> Affirmative Action Challenge in Ga. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A conservative legal foundation that has used  
lawsuits to get rid of affirmative action programs around the South 
has trained its sights on Atlanta, the very symbol of black 
economic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike some of the Southeastern Legal Foundation's previous  
targets -- which surrendered rather than fight -- Atlanta's black 
politicians have angrily defended the system that requires that 
one-third of the companies doing business with the city be 
minority- or female-owned. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Bill Campbell, who as a child was the first black to  
integrate a North Carolina school system, vowed to ``fight to the 
death'' to keep the set-aside program. He has likened the 
foundation to the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no compromise, no mediation, no capitulation. We  
will never stop. We will use all means necessary,'' Campbell said. 
``We are pulling the sheets off the Southeastern Legal 
Foundation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based foundation has said it will file a lawsuit  
next week challenging Atlanta's set-aside program as 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't about race. This is about the city of Atlanta  
breaking the law,'' said Matt Glavin, the foundation's president. 
``When you have statutes that grant certain benefits to one group 
of people because of the color of their skin that are not granted 
to another group, then you're violating the Fourteenth Amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backers of the program -- started in 1975 by Maynard Jackson, the  
city's first black mayor -- say it's still needed to help fledgling 
minority-owned businesses in an environment in which discrimination 
is still prevalent. They fear dismantling it in the cradle of the 
civil rights movement and the birthplace of the Rev. Martin Luther 
King Jr. would have national repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can eliminate it here, the house of cards sort of falls  
down around America. If Atlanta goes, so goes affirmative action,'' 
said Lou Walker, president of the Georgia Black Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta area has been an economic success story for blacks,  
with a thriving black middle class. Just outside the city limits, 
southwest DeKalb County, where many well-to-do and middle-class 
blacks have moved in the past 15 years, is the wealthiest 
predominantly black community in the nation outside of Prince 
George's County in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of the city's 400,000 residents are black.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the threat of a lawsuit from the Southeastern  
Legal Foundation was enough to force the DeKalb County school board 
to abolish a voluntary busing program that allowed blacks to attend 
primarily white schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the foundation forced Atlanta's school system to  
agree to a two-year ban on mandatory racial hiring goals. And in 
Florida, the group successfully challenged Jacksonville's set-aside 
program for contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The group won perhaps its biggest victory earlier this year in a  
suit against the Clinton administration over its statistical 
sampling plan for the 2000 census. The Supreme Court disallowed the 
plan, which was expected to increase the number of minorities 
counted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal should be a racial-neutral society,'' Glavin said.  
``There's no way we'll achieve that dream if we have affirmative 
action programs in place because affirmative action programs 
inherently judge people based on the color of their skin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlanta, the city that called itself ``too busy to hate''  
during the civil rights era, black political and civic leaders have 
promised marches and rallies to save the affirmative action 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Black leaders also threatened to boycott companies led by  
members of the board of directors of the Southeastern Legal 
Foundation. Two business leaders immediately resigned from the 
foundation board. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation was formed in Atlanta in 1976 by a group of  
conservative business and civic leaders. Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who 
represents the suburbs northwest of Atlanta, ran the organization 
during the early 1990s before he got elected to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation had 110,000 contributors and $1.75 million in  
donations last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation said it doesn't want to hurt minorities, even  
publishing a brochure of what it calls race-neutral alternatives 
that would benefit economically disadvantaged businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Affirmative action backers scoff at the idea.  
</P>
<P>
	``If Matt Glavin and the Southeastern Legal Foundation was  
trying to help us obtain first-class citizenship we would welcome 
that, but that's not what they're striving for,'' said Democratic 
state Rep. Billy McKinney of Atlanta. ``I would love for the 
playing field to be level, but we're not there yet.''

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T-MediaOne Merger Protested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A merger that would make AT&AMP;T the nation's  
largest cable TV provider violates antitrust laws and federal 
restrictions on the number of cable customers a single company can 
control, consumer groups say. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America and the Media  
Access Project on Tuesday asked federal regulators to block AT&AMP;T's 
bid to buy MediaOne, saying the cable merger would give the company 
too much control in the markets for cable TV and high-speed cable 
Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups argue that with such a large percentage of the  
market, AT&AMP;T could block new companies from getting into the cable 
business -- which they say already suffers from inadequate 
competition and high prices. Steeper cable rates for consumer could 
be one result of the merger, the consumer advocates warn. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a failure to aggressively apply antitrust and  
competitive policy,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement announced in May, AT&AMP;T would acquire the  
nation's fourth-largest cable TV company, MediaOne, and its 5 
million cable TV customers. AT&AMP;T also would acquire MediaOne's 25 
percent stake in cable systems owned by Time Warner Inc., the 
nation's largest cable TV company. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would lead to AT&AMP;T, which recently took over the  
nation's No. 2 cable TV company, Tele-Communications Inc., becoming 
the nation's largest cable TV provider. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an economic analysis by the consumer groups, AT&AMP;T  
would have a 57 percent market share of homes with its ownership 
stakes in various cable companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission has a cap limiting a  
company's share of total cable households at 30 percent, but the 
rule has not been enforced. The FCC is expected to review the 
ownership restrictions this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T spokesman Jim McGann disputed the consumer groups' figures  
and said they are inflated. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates say even if AT&AMP;T spins off some of its  
smaller holdings, it will still hit the federal limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just don't believe you can fiddle around at the edges of  
this and fix it,'' said Mark Cooper, research director for the 
Consumer Federation of America. The groups have filed a petition 
asking the FCC to enforce its ownership rules, which they say would 
automatically block the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Another petition filed with the Justice Department -- which has  
an ongoing review of the merger -- asks that the deal be halted for 
antitrust concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T asserts that the merger is in the interest of consumers. As  
part of the deal, AT&AMP;T has said it intends to enter the local phone 
market by delivering service over cable lines -- something 
attractive to Washington lawmakers and regulators who would like to 
see more players in that arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very surprising to see consumer leaders attack a merger  
that is so clearly intended to benefit consumers,'' said McGann. 
``The whole point of AT&AMP;T's acquisition of MediaOne is to offer 
consumers a choice in local telephone service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer groups say increased local phone competition is not  
an adequate tradeoff for allowing AT&AMP;T to develop monopolies in the 
cable TV and high-speed Internet market. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, AT&AMP;T would acquire MediaOne's 50 percent  
management interest Road Runner, a major cable Internet services 
provider. Road Runner is the biggest competitor to At Home, in 
which AT&AMP;T now has a controlling stake through its takeover of TCI.

<HEADLINE> SEC Accuses Bala Cynwyd of Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALA CYNWYD, Pa. (AP) -- A brokerage operated by a father and son  
defrauded 7,000 investors of $60 million by selling them unsecured 
debt obligations that were advertised as being safe investments, 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia  
accused William S. Shapiro, 75, owner of Welco Securities Inc., and 
his son, Kenneth Shapiro, 46, president of the company, of 
suggesting in advertisements on kiosks in airports, bus stations 
and other public places that the speculative investments were as 
safe as bank certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shapiros marketed the investments -- debentures of Walnut  
Leasing Co. and a subsidiary -- from 1988 to 1997, the SEC lawsuit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone call to Welco Securities and Walnut Equipment  
Leasing went unanswered this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Walnut Equipment Leasing and the subsidiary were controlled by  
the Shapiros, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit said the two companies filed for bankruptcy in August  
1997, making it unlikely that investors would recoup their money. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary income of Welco Securities has been from  
underwriting the sale of $60 million worth of the debentures in the 
leasing firms, which were in the business of financing leases of 
small-business equipment, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way Walnut (and the subsidiary) were able to generate  
funds sufficient to pay their operating expenses and interest 
payments to existing debenture holders was by selling to the public 
new issues of debt securities,'' according to the lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Heart Plunger Said Better Than CPR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A French study suggests that a gadget that looks something like  
a toilet plunger is better than CPR at saving heart attack victims. 
</P>
<P>
	While some earlier studies have found that the device, the  
Cardio-Pump, can be a life-saver, others have declared it no better 
than standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
	With CPR, a person's palms are pressed against the victim's  
chest to force blood through the body, while oxygen is blown into 
the lungs. The pump is a handheld suction device that is intended 
to apply more pressure to the chest than bare hands alone can 
achieve. 
</P>
<P>
	The pump sells for about $200 overseas and has been used in  
France since 1992 but is not approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration and is not widely available in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine, found that among those patients treated with the pump, 5 
percent survived at least one year, compared with 2 percent of 
those given CPR. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that 6 percent of the patients treated with  
the pump were discharged from the hospital without any brain 
damage, compared with 2 percent for those given CPR. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a better technique out there than standard CPR when it  
is used correctly,'' said study co-author Dr. Keith G. Lurie of the 
University of Minnesota, a co-inventor of the pump. 
</P>
<P>
	The study examined heart attack cases in Paris and Thionville,  
France, from 1993 to 1995. People were given either the pump or 
standard CPR, depending on whether the attack occurred on an even 
or odd day of the month. A total of 377 were treated with the pump 
and 373 had CPR. 
</P>
<P>
	Lurie and colleagues reported in 1994 that short-term survival  
improved using the pump, but that research, conducted in St. Paul, 
Minn., was cut short by the FDA because people who are in cardiac 
arrest cannot give their consent to be test subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released a year later out of California found no  
significant improvement in survival. 
</P>
<P>
	And the American Heart Association has thus far declined to  
endorse the pump, noting that is not FDA-approved. Dr. Lance 
Becker, a member of the AHA council on cardiopulmonary and critical 
care, called the research a ``very promising preliminary study'' 
but said it has some notable weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The study has relatively small numbers for a city as large as  
Paris. Probably the most worrisome fact is that several other 
cities in the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany and California have 
had completely negative results with the same device,'' Becker 
said. ``Additional data needs to be collected before one would want 
to advocate the widespread use of the devices for the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lurie said he believes the inconsistencies arise from varying  
quality of emergency services and training from city to city. 
</P>
<P>
	``I very much regret that this device is not available in the  
United States, because I believe with time, it would lead to 
improved outcomes if used correctly,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Schourek May Go on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A magnetic resonance imaging test Wednesday  
confirmed that Pittsburgh left-hander Pete Schourek has an inflamed 
left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates had not decided Wednesday night whether to put  
Schourek on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Schourek complained of a sore shoulder following his start  
Monday night, a 9-2 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. Schourek lasted a 
season-low 2 2-3 innings, giving up four hits, four walks and five 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Schourek traveled back to Pittsburgh on Tuesday night and had  
the MRI as a precaution to make sure the problem was nothing more 
severe than inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	Schourek, 30, has been bothered by elbow problems since he led  
the Reds to the NL championship series in 1995. He had surgery to 
tighten ligaments in the elbow and clean out scare tissue in July 
1996, followed by arthroscopic surgery to remove bone spurs in 
October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In 16 starts and eight relief appearances, he's gone 3-7 with a  
5.68 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Illinois Power Co. Problems Rampant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A state panel will investigate the reliability  
and management of Commonwealth Edison's distribution system as 
power outages blamed on the July heat wave left more customers in 
the dark Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Commerce Commission, which regulates state  
utilities, announced its planned investigation Tuesday. The 
commission could order ComEd to improve reliability and could seek 
fines, penalties and court injunctions if the utility did not 
comply. 
</P>
<P>
	``The level of performance we have seen in the last two or three  
weeks is totally unacceptable,'' said ICC Chairman Richard Mathias. 
</P>
<P>
	A ComEd executive, meanwhile, said it may be a year before the  
public sees a significant increase in the reliability of ComEd's 
service and three years before all problems are solved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have accomplished a great deal in the last five days toward  
making substantial and necessary improvements in ComEd's system, 
although certainly much more work remains to be done,'' said David 
Helwig, ComEd's acting senior vice president of transmission and 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Helwig was named to his post Friday. The utility's top official  
in charge of distribution, Paul McCoy, resigned under pressure only 
hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	More power outages struck early Wednesday, causing hours-long  
outages to about 8,400 customers in Chicago's western suburbs. The 
company blamed trouble with overhead lines and underground cables. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an unusual summer for us,'' company spokesman Keith  
Bromery told WBBM-TV. He said the extra demand caused by extremely 
high temperatures in late July ``caused some problems with our 
underground cable systems and some transformers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a blackout in the city's business district snarled  
traffic, sent workers scrambling out of darkened skyscrapers and 
forced the Chicago Board of Trade to shut down early.

<HEADLINE>  Sonics Sign Forward Vin Baker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle SuperSonics have managed to keep Vin  
Baker to go along with All-Star point guard Gary Payton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Gary was going to allow me to go anywhere  
else,'' the 27-year-old Baker said Wednesday after signing a 
seven-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gary and I are very good friends,'' Baker added. ``We never  
even talked about me going to a different place. All our talks were 
about next year and how we're going to be a better team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, a four-time All-Star power forward coming off his worst  
season, terminated the remainder of his contract by opting for free 
agency as of July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of Baker's new contract weren't disclosed by Sonics  
president and general manager Wally Walker or Aaron Goodwin of 
Oakland, Calif., Baker's agent. But it's believed he signed for the 
maximum the Sonics could have offered him, $87 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have lost more than $20 million by signing with another  
team. The only clubs with enough room under the salary cap to sign 
him were Toronto, Chicago and the Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker would have received more than $2 million in the coming  
season under his old contract, which was scheduled to run through 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never a doubt,'' Goodwin said. ``It was just a  
matter of timing. We always knew we would get something done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a season shortened by a lockout of the NBA players by the  
owners, the 6-foot-11 Baker reported to training camp about 20 
pounds overweight, missed 16 games with thumb and knee injuries and 
averaged 13.8 points and 6.2 rebounds. His previous lows were 13.5 
points and 7.8 rebounds in his rookie season with Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	He has career averages of 18.1 points and 9.0 rebounds. In  
1997-98, his first season in Seattle, he averaged 19.2 points and 
8.0 rebounds and made the playoffs for the first time in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin wouldn't say if Baker's new contract contained a weight  
clause. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't want to say there's a weight clause,'' he said.  
``There were issues in the negotiations that Seattle had and issues 
that we addressed. The fact that Vin was heavier this year than the 
previous year was an issue. But Vin's a player, a good player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker came to the Sonics on Sept. 25, 1997, in a three-way trade  
involving Milwaukee and Cleveland. Shawn Kemp left Seattle and 
wound up with the Cavaliers in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Sonics signed free agent center Greg Foster to a  
three-year, $5 million contract. He played last season for Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Sonics went 25-25 last season, Walker dumped 10  
players and added six, including Horace Grant, Vernon Maxwell, 
Ruben Patterson and Brent Barry.

<HEADLINE> Astronomers Baffled by Space Light </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An arsenal of analytic tools used to figure  
out the makeup and distance of stars and galaxies has failed to 
unlock the secrets of a mysterious celestial light detected three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fairly uncommon to stumble on something you don't have a  
clue about,'' astronomer S. George Djorgovski said Tuesday. ``It 
certainly hasn't happened to me, and I've been doing this for many 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Djorgovski was part of the team at Caltech's Palomar Observatory  
that detected the object, a pinpoint of light, during a digital 
survey of the northern sky. 
</P>
<P>
	It remains one of the biggest mysteries uncovered by the Digital  
Palomar Sky Survey. The survey, which has collected information on 
more than 50 million galaxies and about 2 billion stars, is about 
two-thirds complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Some astronomers believe the object may be a new class of  
quasar, sources of energy found in the center of galaxies and 
believed to be powered by matter falling into massive black holes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sort of looks a little like them, but not quite. The  
similarity may be superficial,'' Djorgovski said. ``That's the 
closest thing we have found in all the astronomical literature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, astronomers are able to determine an object's  
composition and distance by breaking down and analyzing its light. 
But the mystery object's spectrum does not fit any of the known 
patterns, Djorgovski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Light also usually holds clues about an object's distance. But  
because graphs derived from the light do not match anything known, 
researchers aren't sure whether it is inside or outside the Milky 
Way galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated photographs revealed no changes in its appearance,  
ruling out the possibility that it's an exploding star or 
supernova. 
</P>
<P>
	Djorgovski challenged fellow astronomers to help explain his  
discovery at the June meeting of the American Astronomical Society 
in Chicago. So far, nobody has produced an adequate explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably have looked at the spectra of several thousand  
quasars, and this just doesn't seem to fit,'' said David Crampton, 
an astronomer with the National Research Council of Canada. ``It 
didn't ring any bells.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next step will be to analyze the object's infrared spectrum,  
something Djorgovski hopes to do next month at the Keck Observatory 
in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers also hope that the Hubble Space Telescope might  
someday be pointed at the object, which is located in the 
constellation Serpens. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's very competitive to get time on the Hubble, and they  
don't like fishing expeditions,'' he said.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A crowd including Sacramento Kings forward  
Chris Webber was fired upon by a drive-by shooter early Wednesday, 
but no one was hurt. 
</P>

	The crowd was standing by a hamburger stand about 2:30 a.m. when  
a car with four people inside drove past and shots were fired from 
a 9mm gun, police officer Jason Ficken said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a large group that had gathered. Some knucklehead

Kings was in the area. He wasn't the intended target. He was 
amongst the group.''

<HEADLINE> Loans OK'd for Steel, Oil, Gas Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steel, oil and natural gas companies hurt by  
fallen prices will be allowed to share $1.5 billion in 
government-backed loans to help tide themselves over. 
</P>
<P>
	The loan program was signed into law Tuesday by President  
Clinton on the same day U.S. steel producers announced a challenge 
to deals the Clinton administration reached with Brazil and Russia 
over steel shipments to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., chief proponent of the steel loan  
program, welcomed the help it would provide to steel communities 
and companies that have suffered from low-priced imports. 
</P>
<P>
	``These loan guarantees will provide important access to capital  
for U.S. steel companies,'' he said. ``It is time to stanch the 
damage and give the domestic steel industry a chance to recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steel companies will be able to tap into a $1 billion loan fund  
and borrow up to $250 million each at market interest rates. U.S. 
oil and gas producers and service companies could borrow up to $10 
million each from a $500 million fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure will cost taxpayers an estimated $270 million to  
back the loans. Opponents say the measure will force U.S. taxpayers 
to support companies and banks that make bad business decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, lawyers for U.S. steel producers said they will seek  
to void the agreements Brazil and Russia reached separately with 
the United States to avoid punitive tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Five companies mailed their lawsuits Monday night, while seven  
other producers plan to join the complaint against Russia later. 
The U.S. Court of International Trade in New York, which handles 
trade disputes, will hear the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry attorney Mike Stein said the two agreements would not  
sufficiently protect American producers from illegal foreign 
pricing, although he admitted the challenge will be ``an uphill 
battle.''

<P>
	Had the deals not been reached, Brazil would have faced tariffs  
of as much as 53 percent and Russia as much as 185 percent on the 
industry's main product, hot-rolled carbon steel. Brazil and Russia 
agreed to quotas and minimum prices to avert tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry already won tariffs on Japanese hot-rolled  
shipments and sought sanctions against Russia and Brazil as well to 
combat low-priced hot-rolled imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits filed this week do not challenge a second deal with  
Russia restricting other types of steel. The federal government is 
named as the defendant, although Russia, Brazil and their steel 
producers will be allowed to join in the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Department spokesman Morrie Goodman said the department  
had not received the lawsuit. Lawyers for Russian and Brazilian 
producers also said they had not seen the complaints but believed 
the agreements complied with U.S. trade laws. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision is likely to take at least a year.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Crime Down, Except Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The city's murder rate, already among the highest  
in the nation, has jumped 16.7 percent in the first half of 1999, 
although other serious crimes dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	The city recorded 57,736 serious crimes from January through  
June, a 15.8 percent drop over the same period a year ago. The 
largest drop came in larcenies, which were down 25.5 percent, while 
assaults, auto thefts, burglaries, rapes and robberies also 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
	But murders were up 16.7 percent to 224. Mayor Dennis Archer and  
Police Chief Benny Napoleon said the increase was baffling -- 
especially after declining in 1998 -- because it had no clear cause 
and no obvious solution. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we had sufficient police officers that we could put an  
officer on every corner of the streets where we live,'' Archer 
said. ``The reality is that the homicides that are taking place are 
taking place behind closed doors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit's murder rate still ranks among the highest in the  
country. In 1998 Detroit had 429 murders, or 44.2 per 100,000 
people, ranking it sixth among U.S. cities with more than 100,000 
residents. In recent years, murder has been the leading cause of 
death among children and young adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Crime has been a sore spot for Detroit leaders for many years.  
Safety was often cited as a cause of flight to the suburbs; poverty 
and drugs were blamed for driving crime rates up. 
</P>
<P>
	Making people feel safe was one of Archer's prime goals when he  
took office in 1994, and since then Detroit's crime rate has gone 
down, mirroring a national trend.

<HEADLINE> Heart Plunger Said Better Than CPR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A gadget that looks something like a toilet plunger is better  
than CPR at saving heart attack victims, researchers reported today 
in the latest study on the device called the Cardio-Pump. 
</P>
<P>
	While some earlier studies have found that the device can be a  
lifesaver, others have declared it no better than standard 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
	With CPR, a person's palms are pressed against the victim's  
chest to force blood through the body, while oxygen is blown into 
the lungs. The pump is a handheld suction device that is intended 
to apply more pressure to the chest than bare hands alone can 
achieve. 
</P>
<P>
	The pump sells for about $200 overseas and has been used in  
France since 1992 but is not approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration and is not widely available in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest study, published in today's New England Journal of  
Medicine, found that among those patients treated with the pump, 5 
percent survived at least one year, compared with 2 percent of 
those given CPR. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that 6 percent of the patients treated with  
the pump were discharged from the hospital without any brain 
damage, compared with 2 percent for those given CPR. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a better technique out there than standard CPR when it  
is used correctly,'' said study co-author Dr. Keith Lurie of the 
University of Minnesota, a co-inventor of the pump. 
</P>
<P>
	The study examined heart attack cases in Paris and Thionville,  
France, from 1993 to 1995. People were given either the pump or 
standard CPR, depending on whether the attack occurred on an even 
or odd day of the month. A total of 377 were treated with the pump 
and 373 had CPR. 
</P>
<P>
	Lurie and colleagues reported in 1994 that short-term survival  
improved using the pump, but that research, conducted in St. Paul, 
Minn., was cut short by the FDA because people who are in cardiac 
arrest cannot give their consent to be test subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released a year later out of California found no  
significant improvement in survival. 
</P>
<P>
	And the American Heart Association has thus far declined to  
endorse the pump, noting that is not FDA-approved. Dr. Lance 
Becker, a member of the AHA council on cardiopulmonary and critical 
care, called the research a ``very promising preliminary study'' 
but said it has some notable weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The study has relatively small numbers for a city as large as  
Paris. Probably the most worrisome fact is that several other 
cities in the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany and California have 
had completely negative results with the same device,'' Becker 
said. ``Additional data needs to be collected before one would want 
to advocate the widespread use of the devices for the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lurie said he believes the inconsistencies arise from varying  
quality of emergency services and training from city to city. 
</P>
<P>
	``I very much regret that this device is not available in the  
United States, because I believe with time, it would lead to 
improved outcomes if used correctly,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes 5th Inmate This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A parolee who raped and strangled an  
80-year-old woman in 1983 was put to death by injection Wednesday, 
the fifth execution in Texas in 14 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Mario Trevino Jr., 37, declined to make a final statement.  
</P>
<P>
	Trevino was paroled after serving less than two years for  
burglary. Four months later, he broke into Blanche Miller's home 
near Forth Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Trevino told police that Ms. Miller had surrendered her jewelry  
and silverware and he was loading her stereo into his car when he 
saw her grab a phone to call for help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took the phone away from her and went crazy,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Trevino acknowledged that he was on cocaine and heroin at the  
time, but he insisted in a recent interview that he was only a 
lookout for an accomplice who actually committed the crime. 
Prosecutors said there was no accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
	Trevino was executed a day after the state's highest criminal  
court stopped the execution of a mentally ill killer of five and 
ordered a new examination of whether he is competent to comprehend 
his punishment.

<HEADLINE> Fryar To End Brief Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Apparently, Irving Fryar isn't satisfied just talking to  
football players. The 36-year-old receiver is about to turn in his 
microphone for a helmet and pads. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryar, a 15-year veteran with New England, Miami and  
Philadelphia, has agreed to terms with the Washington Redskins and 
will leave his television reporting job, The Associated Press has 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The signing's a foregone conclusion,'' a team source, speaking  
on the condition of anonymity, said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The wide receiver retired last December following the Eagles'  
season and has been working as a football analyst at WPVI-TV in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryar, expected to sign today, could be in uniform for the  
Redskins' exhibition game on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Luring Fryar back on to the field has been in Washington's plans  
for months and negotiations intensified in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	WPVI sports director Gary Papa said Fryar agreed on Tuesday to  
come back, left for Washington on Wednesday and had a physical and 
tryout scheduled at Redskin Park today. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryar, a five-time Pro Bowl selection, originally decided  
against playing anywhere else because it would mean moving his 
family. After failing to meet performance incentives needed for a 
contract extension with the Eagles, he became a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't change my mind. I'm done. I am done,'' Fryar said  
following last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the agreement were not available. Neither Fryar nor his  
agent, Michael George, were available for comment. Redskins 
director of player personnel Vinny Cerrato would only say that the 
Redskins were in negotiations with the receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryar, who will turn 37 next month, caught 46 passes for 556  
yards with the Eagles last season. He last made the Pro Bowl in 
1997, when he had 86 receptions for Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Broncos    	
</P>
<P>
	Free safety Tori Noel was diagnosed with a herniated disc, an  
injury that might be career threatening. The team said surgery 
would keep Noel out for the year, if not longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Noel collided with running back Olandis Gary at practice.  
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Noel was motionless on his back and remained  
that way as team trainer Steve Antonopulos and his staff attended 
to him. He was later taken away by ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	No paralysis was involved.  
</P>
<P>
                              *Titans    	
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Steve McNair did not practice Wednesday and likely  
will not play in Tennessee's exhibition game Friday night against 
the Arizona Cardinals due to a stiff back. 
</P>
<P>
	The back has given McNair trouble throughout training camp. He  
was able to play last week against Kansas City, but hasn't 
practiced this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil O'Donnell will start if McNair is unavailable to play.  
</P>
<P>
                               *Jets    	
</P>
<P>
	New York added to its receiving corps with the signing of Quinn  
Early. The 12-year veteran has caught 454 passes in a 12-year 
career and will compete with Dedric Ward and Dwight Stone for a 
spot behind starters Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet. 
</P>
<P>
	Early played for Buffalo for the last three years following  
stints with the Chargers and Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets training facility at Hofstra University in Hempstead,  
N.Y., is only about 10 miles from where Early attended high school 
in Great Neck. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	His return was brief, but Mark Collins decided to call it a  
career where he started. Collins, a cornerback on the Giants' two 
Super Bowl championship teams, re-signed with the club for the 
purpose of announcing his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, who played nine games with Seattle last season, wanted  
to end his 13-year career with his original team. 
</P>
<P>
	A second-round draft pick from Cal State-Fullerton in 1986,  
Collins played eight seasons with the Giants. He started on both 
their Super Bowl teams and was in the starting lineup for 104 of 
his 112 games with New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins also played three seasons with Kansas City and one  
apiece with Green Bay and Seattle. In 168 career games, he had 749 
tackles, 27 interceptions and three touchdowns, two on 
interceptions and one on a fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins is the third member of the Super Bowl teams who  
re-signed to retire as a member of the Giants. Center Bart Oates 
and defensive tackle Leonard Marshall did the same. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Bears    	
</P>
<P>
	Chicago signed linebacker Antony Jordan after releasing veterans  
Andre Collins and Jim Schwantz. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, waived by the Indianapolis Colts earlier this week,  
started three games last season and had 27 tackles. The 6-foot-2, 
239-pound linebacker, who also plays on special teams, was selected 
in the fifth round of the 1998 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwantz, who returned to the Bears last season after playing in  
Dallas and San Francisco, was one of just two current Bears who 
played for Mike Ditka, Dave Wannstedt and Dick Jauron. The 
linebacker played in all 16 games last season and led Chicago with 
23 special teams tackles. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Cowboys    	
</P>
<P>
	Deion Sanders said Wednesday that rehabilitation on his left big  
toe still hasn't made it strong enough to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything a cornerback does is on the toes,'' said Sanders,  
who was wearing open-toed sandals with tape holding a foam wedge in 
between the injured toe and the next one. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, turf toe kept Sanders out of the final five games,  
although he returned for a first-round playoff loss and the Pro 
Bowl. He had the toe surgically repaired in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of his rehabilitation is for the left big toe to be as  
strong as the right one. Doctors have told him that might not 
happen for as long as six months after the operation, which would 
be October.

<HEADLINE> Food Lion Buying Hannaford Bros. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCARBOROUGH, Maine (AP) -- Food Lion, a big supermarket chain in  
the Southeast, is buying New England-based Hannaford Bros. Co. and 
its 152 stores as the grocery industry further consolidates in a 
fight for survival with discounters like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The company to be created under Wednesday's deal would have more  
than 1,400 stores from Maine to Florida, and $13.5 billion in 
annual sales, making it the nation's six-largest food retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	The $3.35 billion cash-and-stock offer from the  
Belgian-controlled Food Lion Inc. was the best of four bids for the 
116-year-old company, said Hugh G. Farrington, Hannaford's 
president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrington said Hannaford would have been hard-pressed to  
survive as a small company with $3.3 billion in sales as wave after 
wave of mergers sweep through the supermarket industry and as 
discounters use the ``Wal-Mart competitive model'' to enter the 
grocery business. 
</P>
<P>
	If the industry's consolidation continues over the next few  
years, ``there's not any way Hannaford could continue to compete 
and provide value that shareholders and Wall Street expect,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to discounters Wal-Mart and Kmart Corp. getting into  
the grocery business, recent industry combinations include Safeway 
Inc.'s agreement to buy Randall's Food Markets chain, Kroger Co.'s 
acquisition of Fed Meyer Inc., Dutch food retailer Royal Ahold's 
purchase of Pathmark and the combination of Albertson's Inc. and 
American Stores Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Food Lion offered $79 in cash and stock for each share of  
Hannaford stock, with payments totaling $2.7 billion in cash and 
about $650 million in stock. The value of the stock portion of the 
deal could tumble because Food Lion's stock was immediately 
battered following the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Food Lion's Class A shares plunged 23 percent, or by $2.53 1/8, to  
close at $8.46 7/8 a share Wednesday on the Nasdaq Stock Market. But 
Hannaford soared 14.2 percent, or by $9.06 1/4, to $72.75 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in Food Lion was a reflection of the premium price and  
heavy financing that is expected to hurt earnings over the next 
three years, said Meredith Alder, an analyst with Lehman Brothers 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to buying Hannaford shares, Food Lion also is  
assuming about $300 million in Hannaford debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the road, the merged company is expected to save $40  
million in the first year and about $75 million by the third year 
by combining distribution, marketing, training and buying power, 
the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Together, we are very complementary companies, both  
operationally and geographically,'' Bill McCanless, president and 
chief executive officer of Food Lion, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal provides a premium for Hannaford shareholders,  
continued autonomy for the company and job security for Hannaford's 
work force, Farrington told reporters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hannaford operates in eight states from Maine to the Carolinas  
under the names of Shop 'n Save and Hannaford Food and Drug 
Superstores. It has 24,000 workers, including about 8,000 in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Food Lion Inc. is based in Salisbury, N.C., and owns 1,258  
stores in mid-Atlantic states and the South. Its biggest chain is 
Food Lion, with 1,143 supermarkets in 11 states, and it also owns 
104 Kash n' Karry and 11 Save n' Pack stores. Food Lion has more 
than 92,000 employees and annual sales of $10.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The boards of both companies approved the merger on Tuesday and  
the contract was signed at about 4:30 a.m. Wednesday. The 
transaction still must win antitrust clearance from regulators as 
well as approval from Hannaford shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was announced shortly after Food Lion disclosed it is  
creating a holding company, Delhaize America Inc., ``to facilitate 
future acquisitions as well as the expansion of the company's 
existing operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new holding company reflects the influence of Delhaize SA of  
Belgium, which owns 53.5 percent of Food Lion. Food Lion accounts 
for more than 70 percent of the Belgian company's sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Farrington would continue to operate the  
Hannaford division and would become vice chairman of board. 
McCanless will continue as chief executive of Delhaize America. 
</P>
<P>
	Hannaford, along with Food Lion and Kash 'n Karry, will become  
separate operations of Delhaize America. Save 'n Pack will continue 
to operate under Kash 'n Karry's umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
	Delhaize America is to be listed on the NYSE beginning Sept. 9.  
Food Lion will then discontinue its Nasdaq listing.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Takes on AOL's Messaging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft is aligning itself with three rival  
providers in a bid to loosen America Online Inc.'s grip on the 
fast-growing online instant messaging market. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was expected to announce today that Prodigy, Tribal  
Voice and PeopleLink have agreed to give their users the ability to 
instantly exchange notes with the 1.3 million users of the 
Microsoft Network's instant message service. 
</P>
<P>
	The move increases the pressure on AOL, which is refusing to  
allow MSN's subscribers to communicate by instant messaging with 
the 43 million users of AOL's service. 
</P>
<P>
	Instant messaging offers Internet users the ability to exchange  
notes that immediately pop up on the recipient's computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past month, AOL has repeatedly counterattacked  
Microsoft's attempt to link its product with AOL's service. AOL, 
for its part, has allied with three other Internet service 
providers to enable their users easy access to AOL's Instant 
Messenger service.

<HEADLINE> Qatar's Weightlifters Disqualified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Arab Games authorities on Wednesday  
disqualified Qatar's weightlifting team after nine countries 
threatened to withdraw from the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesting the inclusion of four Bulgarian-born lifters on the  
Qatar team, the other countries issued their threat 45 minutes 
before the start of the competitions Wednesday, Azam Zoubi, 
president of the Jordan Weightlifting Federation, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoubi said the teams agreed to wait until Thursday to give  
organizers time to resolve the dispute. But within a few hours, 
``we were informed by the Players Qualification Committee that the 
entire Qatari team has been disqualified,'' Zoubi told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is expected to put an end to the row in which the  
International Weightlifting Federation also got involved when the 
Arab Games organizers asked it to arbitrate after initial protests 
by other competitors on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy was over Qatar's six-member team, which includes  
one Lebanese and four Bulgarian lifters holding Qatari citizenship. 
Under Arab Games rules, foreigners must have been a citizen for 
four years before representing a country at the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IWF decided on Tuesday that the Bulgarians met that  
criterion. Also, looking at the case from an international 
perspective, it ruled that the four Bulgarians should be allowed in 
the Arab Games because they had not represented Bulgaria in any 
international event. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nine protesting countries provided documentary evidence  
to prove that one of the Bulgarians, Nader Sufiyan, had represented 
Bulgaria last year in Athens under a different name, Zoubi said. 
</P>
<P>
	In light of the new information, Sufiyan was disqualified. But  
the nine countries demanded that the other three Bulgarians be also 
thrown out of the competitions, Zoubi said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was eventually decided to disqualify the entire team.  
</P>
<P>
	The weightlifting events, which had been suspended since  
Tuesday, are now expected to resume on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Suburban Chicago Gun Dealers Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Federal prosecutors have launched what they  
called the nation's first concerted attack on suburban gun dealers 
who arm city gangs, announcing charges Wednesday against 13 buyers 
and sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners and employees of five suburban gun shops and two of the  
shops themselves were accused of supplying guns to ``straw 
purchasers'' with clean police records who were standing in for the 
actual buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say gang members with long rap sheets use the method  
to get around state laws barring convicted criminals from buying 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	While handgun sales are illegal within Chicago's city limits,  
officials say the gangs can get them easily in nearby suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is very simple,'' U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar said.  
``If you violate federal gun laws, you're going to prison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its handgun sales ban, Chicago is awash in gun violence,  
much of it attributed to drug-selling street gangs with thousands 
of members, such as the Gangster Disciples and the Vice Lords. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Chicago had 704 homicides, 536 of them attributable to  
guns, police spokesman Pat Camden said. Gangs members were 
responsible for 182 homicides, all but four involving guns. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1998 undercover investigation by Chicago police produced  
videotapes and other evidence that suburban dealers knowingly sell 
guns to straw purchasers. That investigation prompted Mayor Richard 
M. Daley to file a $433 million lawsuit in February against a dozen 
suburban gun shops and the firearms industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the gun shops whose owners and employees were charged in  
the indictments announced Wednesday were identified in the same 
police investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictments charged owners and employees of shops in the  
suburbs of Franklin Park, Elmwood Park, Melrose Park, New Lenox and 
Oak Lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictments charged that some of the owners and employees  
sold guns to individuals not eligible to buy them. In other cases, 
attempts were made to hide the identity of the buyers with 
falsified receipts and forms for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, Terrace Hampton, 29, of Chicago is charged with  
possessing a gun with the serial number removed and making straw 
purchases of 84 handguns in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Kelvin Jones, 31, of Glendale Heights, bought  
186 guns since July 1998, either directly or through straw buyers. 
Just since May, he has allegedly directed the purchase of 150 guns, 
later resold for profit.

<HEADLINE> Lawrence Welk Memory Keeps Popping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- It's been seven years since he died, 17  
since his phenomenally successful television show left the air, its 
trademark bubbles and its bouncy musical signoff wafting into 
history. And yet Lawrence Welk's appeal -- unlike those 
effervescing, bursting bubbles -- endures. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans from all across America come to the Welk Resort's Champagne  
Theatre to see the Welk show. And they're not just the ones you 
would expect. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh yeah, the blue-haired, elderly ladies, the ones the comedians  
do a brisk trade making fun of, are here. But then so is 
39-year-old Bill Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot here for families,'' Miller said during an  
intermission as he struggled to keep his rambunctious 3-year-old 
son in tow. 
</P>
<P>
	Welk, who died in 1992 at age 89, sought to appeal to families  
during the 31 years he was a Saturday night staple on television. 
And he's still pulling them in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It brings back a lot of memories,'' says Andrea Grogan, who  
came from Texas with her sons, 12-year-old Clint Jarman and 
8-year-old Jake, as well as her parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``They used to watch it every Saturday night,'' she said,  
gesturing toward her parents. ``And I used to sit there and watch 
it with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the secret in pulling in three generations of fans, says Tom  
Bahler, the show's producer, isn't in just putting a live version 
of reruns up on a stage. It's in doing a stage show the way Welk 
would have. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, the challenge was to bring Lawrence into the show as  
much as we could,'' says Bahler, who was given the task of 
revamping the Champagne Theatre's 6-year-old show this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahler, who has worked with such performers as Billy Joel and  
Quincy Jones, produced Super Bowl halftime shows and co-produced 
Michael Jackson's ``We Are the World'' video, could take much of 
the credit for that. But Bahler, who met Welk decades ago when he 
was caddying to raise money for college, insists it really belongs 
to the bandleader himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``See, I think the thing is Lawrence was a lot hipper than  
people knew about,'' the producer says backstage after a recent 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	And so Welk is all but here, a ubiquitous presence on video.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a whole segment of our audience that doesn't know  
Lawrence Welk,'' says one of the show's stars, Janet Lennon of the 
Lennon Sisters, the group Welk's show turned into a household name 
in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're younger, and all they know is this legacy that he left  
behind,'' said Ms. Lennon. ``But now, through the show, they get to 
know the man as well as the legacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, almost a half-century later, it is 1956 again and Welk  
is introducing the Lennon Sisters, saying in that familiar North 
Dakota-German accent of his, ``I'd like you fine people to meet 
some of my fine neighbors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's still presenting his honky-tonk piano player, Jo Ann  
Castle, with a surprise cake on her 17th birthday. And still 
embarrassing his marimba player, Jack Imel, with a picture of him 
when he 12. Imel, balding and middle-aged now, still looks sheepish 
when it flashes on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Somehow there's a freshness to it as the cast of nearly 40  
singers and dancers, backed by the 20-piece Lawrence Welk 
Orchestra, runs through a century of American music, including 
George Gershwin and Willie Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why I think people still like him like they like Count  
Basie and Duke Ellington,'' Bahler says. ``Who, by the way, were 
friends. Who knew Lawrence brought their music to more people than 
they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Welk used to do, the show mixes in favored old performers  
with newer ones, at the same time offering up just about every form 
of music that has been popular, within certain limits. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no disco, and no rap. And when it came time to showcase  
1960s rock 'n' roll, the year highlighted was the relatively tame 
1963. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought about 1968,'' says Larry Welk Jr., the bandleader's  
son. ``But we didn't want to do 1968 because that was the year 
everyone got assassinated. And that was the year of riots and 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like his father would have done, the producers put together a  
show that strove to stir up happy memories, says Welk Jr., the 
principal owner of the Welk Resort 
</P>
<P>
	And that's why people who never knew the Champagne Music Man  
still line up to see him, Bahler says. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure he did some things people said were corny: Played the  
accordion. Featured a polka song on seemingly every one of his 
1,542 shows. Took a turn around the dance floor every time his 
orchestra struck up a waltz. 
</P>
<P>
	But all that worked, says Bahler, because the band was great,  
the music was happy, and if there was one thing Welk wanted to do 
more than anything in the world, it was put on a good show. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was still a teen-ager, Bahler says, he once asked Welk  
to tell him the secret of his success. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `When people pay me $4 for a ticket to hear my music,  
I try to give them $6 worth of entertainment.''

<HEADLINE> Injured Saberhagen To Miss Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston right-hander Bret Saberhagen will miss at  
least one start because of a weak shoulder and current closer Tim 
Wakefield will move back into the rotation Sunday in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen, the two-time Cy Young Award winner, was chased after  
two innings -- his shortest outing in four years -- in Tuesday's 12-1 
loss to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now the shoulder's the weakest it's been my career,''  
said Saberhagen, who missed all of the 1996 season after shoulder 
surgery. ``(Physical therapist, Rich) Zawacki thought that taking 
seven days, doing weights a couple of times a day, getting plenty 
of ice and taking anti-inflammatories will strengthen the 
shoulder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen, 35, who was 15-8 last season -- the most wins since  
winning his second Cy Young in 1989 -- gave up four runs and six 
hits Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen was on the disabled list twice this season, in May  
because of a strained shoulder and in June with a laceration on his 
left foot. 
</P>
<P>
	After Tuesday's game he knew his shoulder didn't feel right when  
he said, ``The choices are to miss a start, miss a couple of starts 
or go on DL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen is 9-5 with a 3.36 ERA in 18 starts.  
</P>
<P>
	Along with the loss of Saberhagen, the team will be looking for  
a closer or a few closers. 
</P>
<P>
	With Wakefield moving back into the rotation, manager Jimy  
Williams apparently intends to work with a bullpen by committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that makes everyone stay on their toes,'' reliever  
Derek Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a fast start, Wakefield has struggled in the closer's  
role, blowing his last two opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to get back to starting condition, where I can last  
more than four innings,'' said Wakefield, who was 14-for-17 in save 
situtaions after Tom Gordon was lost for the season with a strained 
elbow in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	Wakefield, 4-8 with a 5.16 ERA, started 11 games earlier in the  
season. He is the first knuckleball pitcher to record a save since 
Charlie Hough did it with Texas in 1981.

	LOWERING YOUR LONG DISTANCE COSTS: Consumers who make relatively  
few long-distance phone calls each month may want to dispense with 
a long-distance carrier altogether, says Consumer Reports. The 
magazine says many customers pay minimum charges and usage fees to 
big carriers even before they make a single call, but they can 
escape those charges by selecting a cheaper ``dial around'' 
service. These services, which are accessed through phone numbers 
beginning 1010, can cost less than 10 cents a minute and there are 
no up-front fees or charges. But people who drop their carriers 
will find local phone companies are charging them 53 cents per 
month for line-maintenance costs, and there may be a one-time 
charge for dropping your current long-distance provider.

	ARE YOU SATISFIED? ASK ME AGAIN IN AN HOUR: Companies that  
survey their employees about job satisfaction once a year are 
getting an inaccurate picture, says Purdue University psychology 
professor Howard Weiss, who studied managers at a Midwestern office 
and found satisfaction tends to increase and decrease throughout 
the work day. Weiss said daily turmoil, which includes events like 
the boss yelling at someone, may have the greatest effect on how 
people feel about their work. ``Too often organizations assume that 
employees' feelings are constant,'' Weiss said. ``Actually, 
workplaces are more like emotional cauldrons, with daily 
circumstances influencing employee feelings and job performance.''

	IN IT FOR THE MONEY?: It's popularly believed that most of us  
believe we're underpaid, but a survey sponsored by the Lutheran 
Brotherhood, a financial services organization, found 53 percent of 
Americans actually believe they're paid the right amount. The 
survey, which questioned 1,000 people, found that 41 percent 
believe they're not paid enough, and 2 percent said they were 
overpaid. The survey also found that 40 percent of the respondents 
have stayed in a job they didn't like because it paid well. Men 
were more likely than women to stay in a job for the pay. People 
under age 50 were also more likely to stay than older workers were.

<HEADLINE> French Regulators Offer Banks Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- French banking regulators, hoping to break a  
deadlock in a six-month-long banking merger battle, reportedly have 
proposed a compromise centered around both banks taking a minority 
interest in one another. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal calls for Banque Nationale de Paris and Societe  
Generale to hold cross-shareholdings in each other and seek 
cooperative ventures, Dow Jones News Service reported Wednesday, 
citing a person familiar with the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan drawn up by Bank of France chairman Jean-Claude Trichet  
seeks to end the impasse following BNP's bid to acquire both 
Societe Generale and Paribas to create the world's largest bank in 
a three-way merger. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP succeeded in winning a majority stake in Paribas, but it  
gained only a third of Societe Generale's shares and 31.5 percent 
of its voting rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Now regulators have to decide whether BNP should be allowed to  
keep its shares in Societe Generale and proceed with the three-way 
merger with Paribas, or to force it to give up its stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale maintains it will resist BNP's overtures and  
instead seek other European partners. Societe Generale argued that 
BNP should return its shares to the market, because holding a 
minority stake in its main domestic rival destabilizes France's 
banking system. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Dow Jones, the proposed compromise would have BNP  
retain at least part of its stake in Societe Generale, while 
Societe Generale would hold a stake in BNP that would be smaller 
than BNP's stake in Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	The two banks could cooperate in certain areas, but the  
relationship would fall short of the three-way merger BNP had 
sought. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea is to allow the participants to save face, but  
whether it's acceptable depends on the level of shareholdings,'' a 
person close to the talks was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Trichet nor the banks would comment for the story.

<HEADLINE> `Dawson's Creek' Star Growing Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Katie Holmes is growing up -- whether she likes  
it or not. 
</P>
<P>
	She still plays a teen-ager on TV, but Holmes is no longer one  
in real life. She put college on hold to relive the joys and 
heartaches of high school on the WB network's ``Dawson's Creek,'' 
but finds herself back at the crossroads between adolescence and 
adulthood in art and life as Joey, Dawson and the gang enter their 
senior year, and her real world begins changing dramatically, too. 
</P>
<P>
	She's ``a big girl now,'' as she puts it, but is the first to  
admit feeling torn between two worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still having fun playing a teen-ager and I'm still having  
fun being that little kid, and continuing to kind of embrace my 
youth,'' the 20-year-old actress says, sprawled across a couch in 
her Manhattan hotel suite. ``Parts of me do want to be that 
25-year-old who is in complete control and, you know, ready to 
conquer the world and there's the other part that still wants to be 
that demure little 16-year-old, that is still protected. I don't 
know, is that normal?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Complicating any hopes for an easy adjustment into the adult  
world is her thriving film career. She co-stars opposite Helen 
Mirren in the new movie ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,'' and opposite 
Michael Douglas in the recently completed ``Wonder Boys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Holmes reveals the central contradiction that  
surfaces continually in her film and TV work, seeming at once 
unattainable and the quintessential girl next door, a wholesome 
daughter of the Midwest who can't help her undeniably savvy sex 
appeal. She displays the same disarming blend of pixielike 
innocence, brains and guile that makes high school boys weak-kneed 
and melts the hearts of casting agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Green eyes sparkling behind wisps of hair that fall into her  
face as she talks, Holmes at first tries to lounge casually, 
leaning back and speaking in slow, mature tones, but soon she 
speeds up and bounces forward, sitting up to talk with her hands, 
gesturing broadly to emphasize the point she's making: that even 
her seemingly charmed life isn't always easy. 
</P>
<P>
	What's been toughest for Holmes is how easy her leap to stardom  
was, an unknown Catholic schoolgirl from Toledo landing a movie 
role (``The Ice Storm'') in her first Hollywood audition, then 
starring in a teen TV hit right out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
	More movies (``Disturbing Behavior,'' ``Go'') followed,  
accompanied by trappings of fame that included magazine covers 
(Life, Rolling Stone, Seventeen) and a slew of Web sites devoted to 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did struggle for a while with the knowledge and the guilt,''  
Holmes says. ``You know, why did this happen for me? Why didn't I 
struggle for five years? Is this in any way indicative of a long 
career or is this just a short thing? What is THIS? What does this 
all MEAN?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Entering it's third season, ``Dawson's Creek'' will continue  
without creator Kevin Williamson, the writer of such horror films 
as ``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer,'' who leaves 
popcorn hack-and-slash behind in ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,'' his 
directorial debut. 
</P>
<P>
	His departure -- to focus on his new TV project, ``Wasteland'' --  
makes some wonder how long ``Dawson's Creek'' can survive without 
him, especially as its rising young stars (Holmes, James Van Der 
Beek, Michelle Williams) get more movie roles. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``Dawson's Creek'' run that avoids becoming a lifelong saga a  
la ``Beverly Hills 90201'' would suit Holmes just fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to take it slowly and learn as much about it as I can,  
and really take the time to grow up and take the time to challenge 
myself with different roles at the times when I am ready,'' she 
says. ``I also really want to go to college ... I don't know, 
obviously, the time frame. It all depends on what's going on with 
`Dawson's Creek' and where my career is headed after that, if 
anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes sees the irony of playing Leigh Ann Watson in ``Teaching  
Mrs. Tingle, which features Mirren as a heartless teacher out to 
crush Holmes' spirit and prevent her from getting out of their 
one-horse town. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leigh Ann was essentially me when I was in high school, in  
that I was very ambitious and driven and I wanted a life outside of 
what I knew,'' she says, rolling her eyes at how things turned out 
for her, how her all her dreams came true. ``It was so out of the 
blue, so unexpected. I mean all of a sudden my life changed, and it 
was unbelievable, and I was like a deer in the headlights, so many 
emotions going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still am not used to it, I guess. It's been really wild.  
Such a great ride,'' Holmes says, choosing her words carefully 
despite her obvious excitement. ``Right now I just want to be smart 
about it. I know that I've been given so many unbelievable 
opportunities and what I hope to do is just take advantage of those 
opportunities and really take control and grow up and mature into a 
strong woman, a strong actress.''

<HEADLINE> American Airline's Dispute Lingers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Six months of haggling have failed to  
sort out a bitter dispute between American Airlines and its pilot 
union over how Reno Air Inc. should be integrated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline and the Allied Pilots  
Association have argued for months over how the company should fold 
the low-cost carrier -- and its lower-paid pilots -- into its system. 
The disagreement escalated in February into a sickout that stranded 
hundreds of thousands of passengers and cost the company $225 
million -- over $100 million more than it cost to purchase Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Some unsettled issues include the effective date of American's  
takeover of tiny Reno and the treatment of American pilots laid off 
in the early 1990s when a marketing agreement was made between the 
two companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Baker, executive vice president of operations, said the  
items under dispute could add $20 million to the cost of the Reno 
agreement, an amount equal to Reno's current pilot costs for a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	American, the nation's second-largest air carrier, plans to  
continue with its plans to merge the airlines at the end of the 
month even without the blessing of its pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The union met Wednesday to brief its board members on the  
results of the failed mediated talks. 
</P>
<P>
	APA spokesman Gregg Overman said an amended proposal accepted by  
the union -- but unacceptable to the company -- remains the union's 
choice. He said APA continues to meet with lawyers to discuss 
options. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Bernstein, a labor law professor at Washington University  
in St. Louis, said the mediation attempt was the ``last, best 
chance'' for the two sides to reach agreement and what is left is 
an impasse. He said because of a court order from the sickout, the 
pilots have few avenues left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the pilots are pretty much over a rather uncomfortable  
barrel and all they can do is make noises and complain and indicate 
they won't be happy campers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A permanent injunction agreed to by the company and the union  
after the sickout bars APA and its members from strikes, sickouts 
or slowdowns involving this merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been, and will continue, to comply with the judge's  
order, and part of that order prohibits any further job actions 
with the Reno Air dispute,'' said Overman. 
</P>
<P>
	American has not made preparations at this point for any illegal  
work action from the pilots if no deal is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say that we have any active preparation. We certainly  
think we should have an agreement,'' said company spokeswoman 
Andrea Rader.

<HEADLINE> Elliott Continues To Recuperate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Sean Elliott's brother had no hesitation  
about donating a kidney to the San Antonio Spurs forward. 
</P>
<P>
	But Noel Elliott joked Wednesday that he wants a few things in  
return, especially after all the blood tests performed to determine 
whether he was an eligible donor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him that this wasn't going to change anything, things  
would be pretty much the same. But after some of the tests, I told 
him I was going to have to have tickets to the Spurs games -- and a 
book deal,'' said Noel Elliott, 32, who provided a kidney for his 
famous brother Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that I would have done for either one of my  
brothers. Fortunately for Sean and myself, I was a good match,'' 
Noel Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Elliott, 31, a 10-year NBA veteran who helped lead San  
Antonio to its first NBA championship in June, continues to 
recuperate at Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	His blood pressure is good, he is becoming more active and he  
has been taken off intravenous fluids, said transplant surgeon Dr. 
Francis Wright. Sean Elliott is expected to be hospitalized about a 
week. His brother could be released this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, it continues to be good news all around for both of  
them,'' Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Elliott needed the transplant because of a disease called  
focal segmental glomerular sclerosis that prevents his kidneys from 
properly filtering waste from the blood. It is not known what 
causes the illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott has not spoken publicly since the surgery. Through  
spokesman Armando Rios, Elliott issued a statement Wednesday 
calling Noel's kidney ``a gift of love and life'' and thanking 
well-wishers for their support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there will be difficult days ahead. Knowing that I have  
your continued prayers and support, I'm sure it will go well,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Noel Elliott urged others to become organ donors.  
</P>
<P>
	``I do want to encourage anyone that's on the line, on the edge  
of being a donor or not, to seriously consider donating an organ or 
bone marrow,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their mother, Odiemae Elliott of Tuscon, Ariz., also thanked the  
public for prayers, phone calls and messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a step for Sean,'' she said. ``It's his first  
step toward recovery. Noel will be well. Sean has a lifelong 
journey to make, and if you would continue your support and prayer, 
that would be helpful to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Elliott has indicated he wants to return to the NBA after  
the transplant. Doctors have said it could be 2-3 months before 
they know the feasibility of his returning to the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that he'll be able to get back to where he wants to be.  
If he wants to play next season I hope that that's something 
that'll happen for him,'' his brother said. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Sean have seen each other several times since the  
transplant, ``slowly creeping back and forth from room to room,'' 
Noel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The exchanges are just, I would call them, normal brotherly  
love kind of exchanges. He's thanked me repeatedly. I think we just 
feel just a deep commitment to each other,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Low IQs Said Linked to Thyroid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Pregnant women with underactive thyroids are four times more  
likely to have children with low IQs if the disorder is left 
untreated, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine, found that 19 percent of the children born to mothers 
with thyroid deficiency had IQ scores of 85 or lower, compared with 
only 5 percent of those born to mothers without such problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``These children who score in this range may face lifelong  
developmental challenges,'' said the study's lead author, Dr. James 
E. Haddow of the Foundation for Blood Research in Scarborough, 
Maine. ``It's the kind of cutoff that tells you you're going to 
have more troubles in school and more troubles in life in 
general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An underactive thyroid, or hypothyroidism, can be diagnosed with  
a simple blood test and treated with a once-a-day hormone pill. 
</P>
<P>
	The thyroid gland produces a hormone that regulates the  
metabolism and is vital to brain development. Symptoms of 
hypothyroidism include tiredness, muscle weakness, cramps, 
constipation, a slow heart rate, dry and flaky skin, hair loss and 
a deep and husky voice. 
</P>
<P>
	Hypothyroidism affects between 6 million and 7 million Americans  
of all ages, but more than half of those cases are undiagnosed, 
according to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. 
</P>
<P>
	About one out of every 50 women has hypothyroidism during  
pregnancy, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors don't know exactly what causes hypothyroidism, but many  
link it to a lack of iodine, which is found in seafood, dairy 
products, bread and some table salt. 
</P>
<P>
	Untreated hypothyroidism previously had been associated with  
early miscarriages and stillbirths. In addition, thyroid disease 
can raise the risk of heart disease and worsen osteoporosis and 
infertility. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, doctors have also known that a deficiency in thyroid  
hormone in both the mother and fetus could cause developmental 
problems in the child. But researchers were not sure whether the 
child would be affected if the deficiency were found in the mother 
alone. In this study, the children had normal levels of the hormone 
as newborns. 
</P>
<P>
	Haddow and his colleagues believe widespread screening of  
pregnant mothers could help prevent retardation and other severe 
problems with brain development in their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Haddow said decreases in a child's mental abilities can result  
even when the mother's hypothyroidism is mild and she shows no 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, researchers compared 62 women with a deficiency of  
thyroid hormone to 124 women with normal levels, then studied the 
intelligence of their 7- to 9-year-old children. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors looked at the youngsters' language and reading  
abilities, school performance, visual and motor skills and ability 
to pay attention. 
</P>
<P>
	The children of the women with hormone deficiencies scored an  
average of four points lower in IQ than the other youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Robert D. Utiger, an  
endocrinologist and deputy editor of the Journal, said iodine in 
the American diet has declined substantially in the past 15 years 
because of lower salt intake and a reduction in the amount of 
iodine added to bread and animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before routine screening for hypothyroidism in pregnant women  
is introduced, efforts should be made to increase dietary iodine 
intake by ensuring, for example, that all prenatal vitamins and, 
indeed, all vitamin products contain iodine, by increasing the 
amount of iodine added to salt, or by adding iodine to other 
foods,'' Utiger wrote.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Instructs U.S. SWAT Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- There were no set guidelines for it, no  
handbook to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation was new -- two teen-aged gunmen armed with assault  
weapons, ammunition and pipe bombs had entered Columbine High 
School and opened fire. Some students were shot. Others were 
trapped in the school with the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen people died last April, including the gunmen.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you're dealing with a case like Columbine, there is no  
textbook to fall back on,'' said Jefferson County sheriff's 
spokesman Steve Davis. ``We couldn't go on the scene and say, `Last 
time, we had a situation like this.' 
</P>
<P>
	``You're kind of just flying by the seat of your pants.''  
</P>
<P>
	Soon, the questions came. Should officers have moved through the  
building faster? Should they have focused more on finding the 
gunmen than on helping the injured? 
</P>
<P>
	In the four months since the massacre, police across the country  
have begun to alter training procedures based on lessons learned 
from the most deadly school shooting in U.S. history to better 
prepare for the worst-case scenario. 
</P>
<P>
	``Columbine was a big wakeup call for a lot of people,'' said  
Dave Klinger, a University of Missouri professor who oversees a 
federally-funded study of the use of forces by SWAT teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is no longer unpredictable that some school, somewhere is  
going to be assaulted by some sort of lunatic, so you'd better 
prepare for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a recent four-day police seminar in Palm Beach, Fla.,  
participants reenacted the Columbine tragedy, using fake blood, 
screaming students, screeching fire alarms and paint-ball guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Austin, Texas, Police Department recently started a program  
called Homicide in Progress for officers who are among the first to 
respond, said Paul Ford, a senior police officer and SWAT team 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	``It teaches them to recognize situations like Columbine, and  
give the officers some options on what they can do ... whether it 
is rescuing victims or going directly to the source of the 
threat,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to wait until it happens here to start training.  
We're trying be proactive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Columbine, police and emergency response crews descended on  
the school within minutes of 911 calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Terry Manwaring, a Jefferson County SWAT team commander who  
arrived within 12 minutes, found some students, who quickly 
sketched a layout of the school. 
</P>
<P>
	A hastily assembled team of 10 officers from three agencies  
approached the building 20 minutes later, using a fire truck as a 
shield, Manwaring said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the next 1 1/2 hours, three SWAT teams made up of nearly 50  
officers from four jurisdictions gingerly walked through 
debris-filled hallways as explosions echoed, fire alarms blared, 
water flowed from sprinkler systems and emergency strobe lights 
flashed. 
</P>
<P>
	They found hundreds of terrorized students, many barricaded in  
classrooms and closets. 
</P>
<P>
	Manwaring said they received a lot of false information: there  
were as many as eight gunmen; snipers were on the roof; killers 
were hiding in ceilings or in heating ducts or trying to mingle 
with escaping students. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers agree one of their biggest problems was  
communication because different agencies operated on radios set on 
different frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, vital information did not reach crews inside the  
school. Critics have said that may have contributed to the death of 
Dave Sanders, the only teacher killed in the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	A student placed a sign that said ``1 bleeding to death'' in a  
window and it was spotted by police before noon. No one reached 
Sanders until after 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the criticism, Ron McCarthy, who owns a company that  
specializes in training SWAT team members, said he was amazed at 
how well the Jefferson County officers performed, given the 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I think they can respond better, now that this has  
happened? Sure,'' he said. ``As bad as your heart breaks for kids 
in so much pain and trouble, you're going to have to run right past 
them and to the shooters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This went beyond the worst case scenario for a SWAT team,''  
added Larry Glick, executive director of the National Tactical 
Officers Association in Doylestown, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it taught was that an incident as large as Columbine or  
as devastating needs to be planned for.''

<HEADLINE> Jewish Center 911 Call Shows Panic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The terror of a white supremacist's rampage  
at a Jewish community center filled with children was captured in 
911 tapes of urgent pleas for help. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people shot and people are injured!'' an anguished  
woman frantically yelled to a 911 dispatcher. ``I see people's 
blood!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes that police released Wednesday revealed fear and panic  
as well as fast action by employees of the North Valley Jewish 
Community Center, where three boys, a teen-age counselor and a 
receptionist were wounded Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The callers, one a woman hiding under a desk, provided  
dispatchers vital information. Police arrived within four minutes 
of the first call. 
</P>
<P>
	There also was confusion about the gunman's description and  
weapon -- which turned out to be a 9 mm semiautomatic assault 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please hurry. He's got a huge machine gun,'' cried the first  
caller. ``I don't know how many people are dead, but there's 
hundreds of children. There's a summer camp here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a dispatcher sought information about the shooter, the woman  
said she had seen a white, heavyset man wearing black. 
</P>
<P>
	In another call a woman who said she was hiding under her desk  
shouted, ``There's been a shooting here. He shot the whole damn 
place! ... Oh my God! ... He came in with a shotgun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another call came from a man at a convalescent center next door  
to the community center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their preschool just ran in here and they're saying that an  
Asian man just shot somebody,'' the man said before putting a woman 
from the center on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody said they saw an Asian man,'' she said, adding that  
the man was still inside the building ``just shooting randomly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police also received reports that the shooter was a teen-ager,  
and another that he was Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	The very first description phoned in matched that of Buford  
Furrow, 37, the white supremacist who eventually surrendered and is 
charged with attempted murder at the center and the murder of a 
postal worker a short distance away.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Yen and Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against both the yen and the  
euro Wednesday as yen buyers dominated the foreign exchange market. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0523, up  
from $1.0509 late Wednesday. The dollar also was quoted at 112.03 
Japanese yen, down from 114.05. 
</P>
<P>
	A third straight day of gains by the yen stemmed from traders  
selling euros to purchase yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all yen,'' said Mark Gargano, manager of foreign exchange  
at First Union National Bank in Charlotte, N.C. ``The market is 
selling euros and buying yen ... The market has no impetus to buy 
anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strong economic data out of Japan in recent weeks, and a  
possible shift in yen policy by the Japanese government has fueled 
the yen's surge, according to foreign exchange experts. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5203 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5228, and 1.4827 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4786. The British 
pound fell to $1.6015 from $1.6044. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8584 German

<HEADLINE> 'Dolphin-Safe' Label Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Environmental groups say new federal  
``dolphin-safe'' tuna standards taking effect next month amount to 
consumer fraud and predict dolphins will die in much larger numbers 
once huge, encircling nets are allowed again. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups sued in federal court here Wednesday, seeking to  
overturn a finding by Commerce Secretary William Daley in April 
that cleared the way for revisions in the decade-old 
``dolphin-safe'' standard to take effect in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a death warrant for dolphins,'' said Sam LaBudde, a  
marine biologist who led the ``dolphin-safe'' campaign in the 1980s 
after posing as a cook on a Mexican tuna boat for six months and 
videotaping the slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The existing standard, which bans such nets and requires  
observers on the tuna boats to certify that no dolphins are harmed, 
has dramatically decreased dolphin deaths. Fewer than 2,000 
dolphins were reported killed because of tuna fishing last year, 
compared with 133,000 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Latin American fleet generally has not complied and  
therefore is barred from selling its tuna in lucrative U.S. 
markets. Mexican officials consider it a free trade issue, 
complaining that the ``dolphin-safe'' standard is an unfair 
barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, President Clinton signed a 1997 law changing the  
rules to allow the purse-seine nets as long as boats carry 
observers and allow the dolphins to escape without injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists got an amendment passed that put off the  
changes until the government could prove the nets don't harm 
dolphin populations. Despite extensive evidence to the contrary by 
the department's own scientists, the plaintiffs say, Daley declared 
in April that researchers couldn't prove such harm. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins have been at risk because schools of yellowfin tuna  
often swim below dolphin herds off the central Pacific coast. From 
the 1950s to 1980s, dolphin populations were decimated as tuna 
fishermen hauled in both species in hydraulic nets, keeping the 
tuna and sloughing off the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all environmental groups back the lawsuit. Greenpeace, the  
World Wildlife Fund, the Center for Marine Conservation and the 
Environmental Defense Fund argue that it is better to have 
observers on board the boats than not. 
</P>
<P>
	LaBudde says that places too much faith in the ability of a  
solitary observer to monitor boatloads of fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you think a Mexican observer won't be under pressure to  
fabricate that dolphins weren't injured, you're wrong,'' he said. 
``The observer's job under this proposed system would be an 
unbelievable nightmare.''

<HEADLINE> Cohen Vietnam Visit Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Vietnam are discussing  
arrangements for a possible visit to Hanoi by Defense Secretary 
William Cohen but no date has been set, Cohen's chief spokesman 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Kenneth Bacon said both governments ``fully expect'' a  
suitable date to be worked out ``but it's unlikely to be 
September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Far Eastern Economic Review reported that Hanoi called off a  
Cohen visit that had been scheduled for Sept. 30. Asked about the 
report, Bacon said, ``Both the United States and Vietnam continue 
to discuss an appropriate time for the secretary to go.'' He 
declined to go into more detail. 
</P>
<P>
	The main vehicle for U.S.-Vietnamese military relations is the  
Joint Task Force Full Accounting, which was established to search 
for and recover the remains of American servicemen lost in the 
Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	No U.S. defense secretary has visited Vietnam since the war.  
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of increased cooperation, Vietnam sent two observers  
this month to a U.S.-Thai counter-narcotics training exercise in 
Thailand involving U.S. military and Drug Enforcement Agency 
personnel as well as Thai border patrol police and provincial 
police, Bacon said. It was the first time Vietnam had associated 
itself with such an exercise, he said.

<HEADLINE>  Sean Elliott Continues Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- San Antonio Spurs forward Sean Elliott must  
be feeling better. He's complaining -- not about his condition, but 
about his computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, who underwent kidney transplant surgery Monday at  
Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital, complained Tuesday 
that he couldn't log onto the Internet while he was in intensive 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	The basketball player, who received a kidney from his brother,  
Noel, was later moved to a private room so he could use the 
Internet to check for electronic get-well messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors told reporters Tuesday that Elliott would be allowed to  
start eating some solid food after he was moved out of intensive 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kidney is functioning very well right now,'' said Dr.  
Francis Wright, who performed the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sean is doing so well right now. His spirits are still high,''  
said Armando Rios, a spokesman for Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Steve Kerr visited his teammate with the Spurs and  
the University of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr was the only Spurs player who knew the seriousness of  
Elliott's kidney problems until he revealed July 21 that he needed 
a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best possible scenario,'' Kerr said. ``I was  
worried that Sean was going to have to wait in line behind 
thousands of people. When I heard that his brother was a match, I 
was thrilled. He's one of my favorite people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have refused to speculate whether Elliott will be able  
to resume his NBA career, but Kerr believes his friend will return 
to the NBA championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr is convinced Elliott will return because of the resolve he  
showed during the NBA playoffs when he continued to play although 
he knew his kidneys were failing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is unprecedented, and I don't think anybody has ever  
attempted this,'' Kerr said. ``But the fact that he played 
throughout the playoffs and in the finals at such a high level, it 
probably tells you what kind of athlete Sean is and what his body 
is able to withstand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The surgeon said Elliott is taking high doses of antirejection  
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott will spend the rest of the week building his strength  
and meeting with ``predischarge teachers'' about his recovery 
regimen. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll kind of get his owner's manual for his new kidney so  
that he can learn about things to be on the look out for,'' Wright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, 31, who helped lead the Spurs to their first NBA  
championship in June, needed the transplant because of a condition 
that prevents the kidneys from properly filtering waste from the 
blood. It is not clear what causes the disease, known as focal 
segmental glomerular sclerosis.

<HEADLINE>  Crew 4, MetroStars 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Stern John tallied three goals and  
took over the Major League Soccer goal-scoring lead as the Columbus 
Crew handed the New York New Jersey MetroStars their eighth 
straight loss, 4-2 Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	John, who registered his second hat trick of the season and a  
record fifth of his MLS career, now has 16 goals and is one ahead 
of D.C. United's Roy Lassiter. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory boosted Columbus to 15-8 and left the Crew in second  
place in the MLS East with 35 points. The MetroStars, who have lost 
14 of 15, are now 5-18 with nine points. 
</P>
<P>
	John tallied his first goal in the 17th minute with a header  
into the right corner of the MetroStars net. 
</P>
<P>
	The play began with a corner kick by Robert Warzycha which went  
to Brian Maisonneuve at the top of the box. Maisonneuve volleyed 
the ball to John and when the MetroStars' attempt at an offside 
trap failed, John headed the ball home. 
</P>
<P>
	After missing several good chances, the MetroStars finally tied  
it in the 38th minute after Ansel Elcock's foul on Miles Joseph 
gave the home team a free kick from just outside the box. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Kelly bent his free kick into the box where Mark Semioli  
looped a header over Columbus goalkeeper Mark Dougherty, who had 
come off his line. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus wasted little time taking charge in the second half.  
The Crew snapped the deadlock in the 47th minute on a left-footed 
shot from the top of the box by John DeBrito following a Warzycha 
free kick. 
</P>
<P>
	John then took over, running into a header from Brian McBride  
and flicking in a shot from short-range in the 59th minute. Three 
minutes later Warzycha recorded his third assist of the game, 
passing to McBride whose cross was headed home by John. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars closed the scoring in the 77th minute when John  
Wolyniec, on loan from the Long Island Roughriders, knocked home a 
rebound of a shot by Petter Villegas.

<HEADLINE> Purdue Appeals NCAA Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Purdue University is appealing NCAA  
sanctions that include two years of probation, forfeiture of 24 
basketball games and the loss of revenue from the 1996 NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the NCAA's findings didn't meet the organization's  
minimum standard of being ``credible and persuasive,'' and the NCAA 
enforcement staff failed to follow required procedures in some 
aspects of its inquiry, Purdue athletic director Morgan Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said some of the recommended penalties were excessive,  
compared with those levied against other institutions in similar or 
more serious cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have a disagreement,'' Burke said in announcing the  
appeal on Tuesday. ``Unlike the old West when you go out with your 
six-shooter, these are the rules. You play it out and get the 
disagreement resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a chip on our shoulder. We just have strong  
enough convictions about our positions that we want to take it all 
the way to the wall,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA's Committee on Infractions ruled in June that Purdue  
had violated rules on recruiting, extra benefits and ethical 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal challenged the committee's conclusions concerning a  
$4,000 bank loan made to former Purdue player Luther Clay in August 
1995 and financial assistance provided by Indianapolis businessman 
Gene McFadden to the mother of former Purdue player Porter Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, the committee said former assistant coach Frank  
Kendrick arranged the contacts between the students and the outside 
parties. Kendrick has since been reassigned to a university 
position outside the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	The game forfeitures, if upheld on appeal, could cost Purdue the  
Big Ten championship it won in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also recommended a reduction in the number of  
official recruiting visits to campus by prospects from 12 to four 
each in 1999-2000 and 2000-2001, and the loss of one scholarship 
each year in the 2000-20001 and 2001-2002 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke said the school did not appeal the scholarship reduction  
because it wanted to show it was being reasonable and to 
acknowledge that some punishment might be warranted from the 
charges levied against Kendrick. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals process is likely to take several months. It was  
sent to the NCAA last weekend, and the association has 30 days to 
respond. Purdue then will have two weeks to file a rebuttal of the 
response, and after that the NCAA Infractions Appeals Committee 
will schedule a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee could uphold all the sanctions, reduce them or set  
them aside completely. According to the NCAA, sanctions have been 
modified in about one-third of the 18 cases that have gone before 
the committee since 1993.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Says Teen Drug Use Is Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teen drug use is beginning to creep down after  
climbing through the 1990s, the government reported Wednesday. An 
annual survey found that one in 10 teen-agers uses marijuana or 
other illegal drugs -- down from 1997 though still nearly double 
what it was in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and others called the results solid evidence  
that the nation had reversed course. ``We have turned an important 
corner,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and others credited increased attention to the issue by  
government, communities, parents, media and schools. ``The message 
is finally getting through,'' said Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, drug use among Americans of all ages remained level  
last year, and use among young adults continued its steady rise, 
according to the household survey of 25,500 people ages 12 and up. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, 78 million Americans have tried illegal drugs at some  
point in their lives, the survey said. Marijuana remained far and 
away the most popular drug, but 41.3 million Americans also had 
tried heroin, cocaine or some other illegal drug, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
	Of them, 13.6 million were current users -- about 6.2 percent of  
all Americans -- half what it was at its 1979 peak. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse also measures  
alcohol consumption, which was steady last year, and cigarette 
smoking, which fell to its lowest level since 1971 when the survey 
began. Last year, 27.7 percent of Americans smoked, with teen 
smoking unchanged and smoking among young adults continuing to 
rise. Cigar smoking edged up. 
</P>
<P>
	But the survey is most carefully watched as a gauge of teen  
illicit drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	It found 9.9 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds had used some sort  
of drugs within the past month, down from 11.4 percent in 1997. A 
second government survey, which uses a different method to measure 
teen drug use, has found drug use stable over the past two years 
after years on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Shalala said the combination of these results leads her to  
conclude that drug use may actually be falling. In the past, she's 
called it a ``glimmer of hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others weren't as sure.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would want to see at least another year or two of declining  
figures before I could feel that we have a real trend going,'' said 
Dr. Herbert Kleber, who worked on drug policy under President Bush 
and now is medical director at Columbia University's Center on 
Addiction and Substance Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, overall teen drug use and use of marijuana has  
fluctuated over the last few years, though the drop from 1997 was 
statistically significant. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline was driven by older teens -- those ages 16 and 17 --  
with the percentage having used drugs in the past year falling from 
30.7 percent to 26.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, teen drug use rose through much of the 1990s and  
remains much higher than it was in 1991 and 1992. Researchers 
attribute the rise to a relaxing of the intense prevention efforts 
of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	But Shalala and Barry McCaffrey, Clinton's drug policy adviser,  
say renewed attention is making a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sending a tough message against drugs, particularly to young  
people, is a little like sending a message into deep space,'' 
Shalala said. ``The message goes out, and then you wait a year or 
more to find out if it's been heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kleber agreed that positive messages are making a difference.  
When government officials from Clinton on down talk about drugs, 
the media report on the issue, parents talk about it and 
communities mobilize, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled going to see the new Star Wars movie with his  
grandson and seeing two anti-marijuana ads before the previews. 
``That's an audience you really want to get,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, he said, anti-drug messages are back in vogue. ``Every  
day, when I walk in downtown Manhattan, I see a billboard that 
says, `Are you waiting for your child to talk to you about 
marijuana?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's news was not as good for young adults aged 18 to 25.  
The survey found 16.1 percent of them were ``current users,'' 
meaning they had used drugs in the past month. That rate has 
fluctuated over the last few years but is up from 13.3 percent in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, cocaine use rose last year, from 1.2 percent in  
1997 to 2 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials suspect that the rising statistics relate to this  
particular group of people -- the same people who were more likely 
to use drugs when they were teen-agers, who have now become young 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
	And young adults are particularly hard to reach, said McCaffrey.  
``It's easier to influence (them) as adolescents.''

<HEADLINE> Lyndon LaRouche Seeks Matching Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic candidate Lyndon LaRouche filed  
papers with the Federal Election Commission Wednesday asking for 
federal matching funds for the presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	The LaRouche campaign says it has raised more than $7,000 in  
contributions of $250 or less, beating the $5,000 requirement to 
receive matching funds. National spokeswoman Debra Hanania-Freeman 
expects the FEC to respond to the request within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hopeful that along with the participation of Bill  
Bradley and Al Gore this will open up a broad spectrum of debate 
within the Democratic Party,'' Freeman said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	LaRouche, who is in Germany recovering from double bypass  
surgery, has waged five other unsuccessful bids for the White 
House. With this latest try, Freeman said the campaign has raised 
more than $1 million and recruited some 7,000 volunteers thus far. 
</P>
<P>
	His campaign will focus on the ``advanced state of the global  
economic crisis,'' Freeman added. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Reagan administration, LaRouche was imprisoned for  
five years on charges of tax fraud and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	FEC spokesman Ian Stirton said the commission will process the  
request in a timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Stirton said, 35 states will not put the names of  
convicted felons on the ballot. LaRouche also has lost the right to 
vote for himself.

<HEADLINE> 2.7M Americans May Have Hepatitis C </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	At least 2.7 million Americans carry the hepatitis C virus,  
making it the most common blood-borne infection in the United 
States, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in  
Atlanta represents the first look at the prevalence of hepatitis C 
in the United States. The estimate was published in Thursday's New 
England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what we consider a conservative estimate,'' said Dr.  
Harold S. Margolis of the CDC. ``This is everyday Mr. and Mrs. 
American who live in a household. This doesn't include the homeless 
and the prison population. The number could be higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For reasons that aren't entirely clear, an estimated 1.2 million  
other people who were once infected no longer have any signs of the 
virus, Margolis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We and others have said that once infected, not everyone  
remains infected. Unfortunately, it's still a pretty high 
percentage that stay infected, 75 percent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists discovered the virus in 1989.  
</P>
<P>
	People who inject illegal drugs or engage in unprotected sex  
account for most people who carry hepatitis C, but people who had 
blood transfusions before mid-1992 also are at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease and alcohol abuse rank as the leading causes of  
liver disease. The infection can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer 
and results in about 1,000 liver transplants annually in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The standard treatment is the drug interferon or a combination  
of interferon and ribavirin. In some patients, drugs can make all 
signs of the virus disappear, but it's unclear how long the effect 
lasts.

<HEADLINE> Three Insurers Sued for $100M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UPPER MARLBORO, Md. (AP) -- Seven Maryland motorists are seeking  
$300 million in damages from three of the nation's largest 
insurance companies for allegedly cheating policyholders out of 
millions in personal injury protection benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys filed three class action lawsuits Wednesday against  
Allstate, Geico and State Farm Mutual insurance companies in Prince 
George's County, Md., Circuit Court. Each of the lawsuits seeks 
$100 million in punitive and compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``They purchased insurance coverage for their payments of  
medical bills and lost income in the event of a car accident,'' 
said attorney Joseph Cammarata. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the companies rely upon computer programs, record  
reviews, and the interpretations of company doctors to determine 
how medical claims benefits are reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The insurance companies used those reports as a pretext to  
slash and deny their legitimate claims,'' said Cammarata. 
</P>
<P>
	``We charge each of those companies with using unfair and  
deceptive trade practices,'' Cammarata said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although company officials declined to discuss the allegations,  
pending reviews by their lawyers, a spokesman for State Farm 
defended the practice of reviewing claims to determine appropriate 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps to keep the costs of insurance down for our  
customers,'' acknowledged spokesman Charles Ingram. 
</P>
<P>
	An American Insurance Association spokesman condemned the  
lawsuits as an effort to chill steps taken to control costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``State law requires insurers to review medical bills to  
determine what is reasonable and necessary,'' said David Snyder, 
general counsel for the trade association. 
</P>
<P>
	The AIA contends that aggressive review measures reduce the  
incentives for fraudulent treatment and overbilling in personal 
injury lawsuits because medical bills are the basis for determining 
pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suspect charges not only increase the medical payments, but  
they also increase settlement values and legal fees,'' said Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers involved in the case said they expect ``thousands if not  
hundreds of thousands'' to become parties in the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	According to records filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange  
Commission, authorities in five states are pursuing lawsuits 
against Allstate over company mailers that suggest that those 
involved in accidents with its policyholders can settle their cases 
without legal representation. Allstate is also the target of five 
prospective class action suits alleging consumer fraud and the 
unauthorized practice of law. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, a state of Washington appeals court reinstated a class  
action lawsuit against State Farm that alleges that medical 
reimbursement claims were improperly denied by the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some of the clients say their cumulative losses have  
run as high as $3,000 to $6,000, many of the unreimbursed claims 
total less than $100 each. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of principle and fraud,'' said Silver Spring,  
Md. resident, Herbert Ostrof. ``State Farm was not a good neighbor 
at all in my case,'' said Ostrof, referring to the company's 
advertised slogan ``Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.'' He 
added that his unreimbursed expenses totaled just $87. 
</P>
<P>
	``Geico did not stand up to their contract,'' said George Lewis,  
of Fort Washington, Md. Lewis had $7,500 in personal injury 
protection coverage on Jan. 12, 1998 when he was injured in a 
traffic accident. He contends that Geico has failed to pay $3,028. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been three years and I still have outstanding benefits  
that have not been paid up to $5,900,'' said LaCountess Corbitt, of 
Lanham, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the plaintiffs have maintained their coverage with the  
companies despite the disputes.

<HEADLINE> Shatner's 911 Call About His Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor William Shatner told a 911 operator  
``my wife's at the bottom of the pool'' in a plea for help after 
finding her submerged body. 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner returned to his Studio City estate shortly after 10 p.m.  
Aug. 9 and found his wife Nerine, 40, in the deep end, authorities 
said. Police said it was an accidental drowning and autopsy results 
are due in about a month, pending toxicology tests. 
</P>
<P>
	On the audio tape released Tuesday, the 68-year-old ``Star  
Trek'' actor and host of the old ``Rescue 911'' TV series makes a 
frantic plea. 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner: ``Oh my God!''  
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: ``What's your problem there, sir?''  
</P>
<P>
	Shatner: ``My wife's at the bottom of the pool.''  
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: ``OK, did you get her out of the pool yet, sir?''  
</P>
<P>
	Shatner: ``No, not yet.''  
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: ``I want you to take her out of the pool right  
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner: ``She's at the very deep end (unintelligible).''  
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: ``OK, sir. If you can, grab something and get her  
out of the pool. Sir. Sir. Right away, get your wife out of the 
pool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner: ``OK.''  
</P>
<P>
	Dispatcher: ``Don't hang up the phone. (Shatner hangs up.)  
Hello?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner then dove in and pulled his wife out of the pool, but he  
was unable to resuscitate her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, a tearful Shatner emerged briefly from his home and  
told reporters: ``My beautiful wife is dead. She meant everything 
to me. Her laughter, her tears and her joy will remain with me the 
rest of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shatner, a former model, married the actor less than two  
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner, best known as Capt. James T. Kirk on the 1960s science  
fiction television show ``Star Trek'' and the ``Star Trek'' movies, 
also starred in the TV police drama ``T.J. Hooker'' and served as 
host of ``Rescue 911,'' a reality-based show on real-life 911 
rescues.

<HEADLINE> Softball Fight Causes Prison Melee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ESTANCIA, N.M. (AP) -- A fight during an inmate softball game led  
to a melee at a private prison in which seven people were injured, 
including a guard who was in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The inmates apparently gained brief control over a couple of  
areas of the Torrance County Detention Facility on Tuesday but none 
escaped, said Darren White, state Department of Public Safety 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Two guards ``got beat up real bad'' and others suffered minor  
injuries, Torrance County Sheriff Pete Golden said. One guard was 
in critical condition today at University Hospital in Albuquerque. 
Another person -- hospital spokeswoman Cindy Foster did not know 
whether he was a guard or a prisoner -- was in satisfactory 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The disturbance spread after two inmates attacked each other  
with baseball bats, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	Inmates rushed one of the prison's inner fences, and when guards  
closed the gate one officer was left behind, White said. Another 
guard fired a shotgun as a warning, and some pellets hit one 
inmate, he said. The inmate was treated at a hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
	When deputies arrived, 60 to 80 inmates were trying to tear down  
the innermost of three fences, Golden said. 
</P>
<P>
	The disturbance lasted about 20 minutes, state police Sgt.  
Robert Holguin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prison, about 55 miles southeast of Albuquerque, is operated  
by Corrections Corporation of America, based in Nashville, Tenn. It 
houses about 400 inmates, mostly federal prisoners, and has 250 
employees, said Gerges Scott, state Corrections Department 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunately the case that the inmates behind bars are  
behind bars for a reason,'' Susan Hart, a CCA spokeswoman, said 
today in Nashville. ``Their behavior doesn't change when they are 
incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been in this business long enough to know that incidents  
can and will occur.''

<HEADLINE> Credit Solicitations Greet Students / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On many college campuses, credit card  
solicitations are as much a part of the back-to-school scene as pep 
rallies and sorority and fraternity rush week. 
</P>
<P>
	Applications are pinned to bulletin boards, passed along at book  
stores or handed out from tables set up in student centers and 
cafeterias -- along with free T-shirts and other enticing trinkets. 
</P>
<P>
	About three-quarters of all colleges and universities allow some  
form of on-campus solicitation, and a near-equal percentage of 
full-time undergraduate students already hold some type of plastic, 
studies show. 
</P>
<P>
	But is a teen-ager preoccupied with classes and dorm living --  
and with no steady income and little budgeting skills -- deserving 
of credit? 
</P>
<P>
	Credit cards can be beneficial to students. They're a convenient  
way to pay for school supplies, useful in emergencies, and 
establish a credit history that someday will allow the student to 
finance a new car or home. 
</P>
<P>
	And credit card companies love doing business with students  
because of their immense customer loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``You give a college kid a credit card and 15 years later they  
still have that credit card,'' said Howard Dvorkin, president of 
Consolidated Credit Counseling Services, a nonprofit service in 
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's (also) a profitable market and the risk factor is  
generally low,'' he noted. ``No. 1, the balance (limit) they give 
to students is relatively low, and No. 2, Mommy and Daddy will bail 
the student out if the card goes into default.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that's the downside of giving credit cards to students,  
critics say. In fact, some college administrators are starting to 
show concern about credit card debt, and a handful of schools have 
even banned credit card marketing on campus. At least one school, 
Indiana University, has made a credit card debt seminar part of its 
new student orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	The average undergraduate has $2,226 in credit card debt, 14  
percent of students carry balances between $3,000 and $7,000, while 
10 percent have balances exceeding $7,000, according to Nellie Mae, 
a nonprofit student loan provider. Many of the biggest debtors, it 
says, hold four or more cards. 
</P>
<P>
	What a contrast from just two decades ago when credit card  
underwriting criteria was more stringent and most students couldn't 
even secure a card without the backing of a co-signer, noted Alan 
D. Blair, director of credit management at Nellie Mae. ``In the 
early 1970s, students borrowed an average of $2,000 to cover the 
entire cost of their education,'' he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	While most students are conscientious about repaying debts --  
nearly 40 percent pay off their card balances each month, according 
to the Public Interest Research Group in Washington, D.C. -- even 
the most responsible student can get into serious trouble. And the 
last thing students need is more debt when they're already facing a 
mountain of student loans after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the credit card companies busily soliciting on campus  
right now, there is an army of consumer groups quick to offer 
recommendations for students and their parents for managing debt. 
</P>
<P>
	CCCS, for example, offers a pamphlet, ``Budgeting 101: Your  
Money Guide for Getting Through School,'' free through its Web site 
(www.debtfree.org) or by calling 1-800-SAVE-ME2. 
</P>
<P>
	Useful information also can be found on the Web sites of other  
groups, including PIRG (www.pirg.org) and Nellie Mae 
(www.nelliemae.org). 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the nonprofit National Foundation for Consumer  
Credit in Silver Spring, Md., welcomes parents and students to drop 
in on any of its offices for budgeting tips and counseling, free of 
charge or for a nominal fee. To locate the nearest office, check 
out the Web site (www.nfcc.org) or call 1-800-388-2227. 
</P>
<P>
	A few of their many basic suggestions for students:  
</P>
<P>
	--Understand credit cards basics, such as the issues of grace  
periods, late payments, finance charges and minimum payments. 
</P>
<P>
	--Create a budget for the school year to better understand how a  
credit card should be used within the spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
	--Maintain only one card and keep the credit limit low.  
</P>
<P>
	--Shop around for the best card deal, though avoid low ``teaser''  
rates since they will increase in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pay off the balance each month, or pay more than the minimum to  
avoid running up big interest charges. 
</P>
<P>
	--Consider starting out with a debit card, which deducts charges  
from a checking account, or a secured card, which only allows you 
to charge what's deposited in an account.

<HEADLINE> Callaway Golf May Sue Taylor Made  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Callaway Golf Co. has a new president. Its next step may be  
going to court to keep Taylor Made Golf from hiring one of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Ely Callaway, after announcing Chuck Yash would replace him as  
president, on Wednesday said he was exploring legal options whether 
he could prevent Taylor Made from hiring as president a former 
executive who worked under Yash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our lawyers are looking at all our potential actions,'' he  
said from Callaway headquarters in Carlsbad, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Across town, Taylor Made announced that George Montgomery, the  
president and CEO since 1996, is leaving and that Mark King would 
take over as president of Taylor Made and Adidas. Both are owned by 
Adidas-Salomon AG. 
</P>
<P>
	King has spent the past 18 months working as vice president of  
sales for Callaway Golf Ball Co., which plans to launch its new 
golf ball in January. Callaway said King's contract, which has 14 
months remaining, includes a no-compete clause. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a very strong hold on everybody in our company about  
the use of proprietary information,'' Callaway said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Taylor Made spokesman did not immediately return calls seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the irony is that Yash came to Callaway after spending  
four years as president of Taylor Made. King also worked at Taylor 
Made, first as a sales representative and later as vice president 
before joining Callaway. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not have an employment agreement'' with Taylor Made,  
Callaway said. ``We hired him to be involved in our golf ball 
business, to set up a sales operations. He did not go into our golf 
club area because of his golf club experience at Taylor Made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yash, who also has worked for Spalding's golf division, assumes  
the job as president immediately. He also will replace Callaway as 
CEO by Dec. 31, 2000, unless the 80-year-old founder and chairman 
decides to get out of active management any sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	Yash will remain in charge of the golf ball subsidiary through  
the year 2000 to preside over the launch of Callaway into the 
competitive golf ball market. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor Made entered the ball market earlier this year, as did  
Nike and Cobra. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the largest golf club business in the world,'' Yash  
said. ``We have to do what we need to do to compete in the ball 
business with equal force, and as a major player.''

<HEADLINE> Boxer Fernando Vargas Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Felony assault charges were filed  
against IBF junior middleweight champion Fernando Vargas and could 
lead to a nearly eight-year prison term if he's convicted, a 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, 21, of Oxnard and four friends were charged Tuesday with  
assault with a deadly weapon and conspiracy to commit a crime 
stemming from a July 25 altercation at a Summerland home, Deputy 
District Attorney Hilary Dozer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boxer, who has maintained his innocence, said in a  
statement: ``I would like to thank all my fans for standing by me 
in these moments of crisis. I am your champion now and always will 
be your champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants were accused of assaulting Doug Rossi, 23, who  
had broken up a fight between Vargas and a female friend's 
ex-boyfriend, sheriff's Sgt. Bill Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight took place eight days after Vargas, whose professional  
record is 17-0 with 17 knockouts, defended his title by defeating 
Raul Marquez.

<HEADLINE> Food Lion-Owner To Buy Hannaford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- The Belgian-controled business that runs  
Food Lion supermarkets is buying Maine-based Hannaford Bros. Co. 
for $3.35 billion in cash and stock to create the sixth-largest 
food retailer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today comes as the supermarket industry  
consolidates to better compete with one another and with huge 
discounters, notably Wal-Mart, which are expanding grocery 
operations. In addition, by expanding, the supermarkets hope to be 
able to drive better deals with their suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company would have more than 1,400 stores from  
Maine to Florida with annual revenue of about $13.5 billion and 
more than 116,000 full- and part-time workers, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hannaford Bros., based in Scarborough, Maine, is a 152-store  
supermarket chain with stores from Maine to the Carolinas. The 
116-year-old business has 24,000 employees and annual sales of $3.3 
billion. Its stores operate under the names of Shop 'n Save and 
Hannaford Food and Drug Superstores. 
</P>
<P>
	Food Lion Inc. is based in Salisbury, N.C., and owns 1,258  
stores in mid-Atlantic states and the South. Its biggest chain is 
Food Lion, with 1,143 supermarkets in 11 states, and it also owns 
104 Kash n'Karry and 11 Save n' Pack stores. Food Lion has more 
than 92,000 employees and annual sales of $10.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Delhaize SA of Belgium owns 53.5 percent of Food Lion, which  
accounts for more than 70 percent of Delhaize's sales. Separately 
today, Food Lion said it was forming a holding company to be called 
Delhaize America Inc. ``to facilitate future acquisitions as well 
as the expansion of the company's existing operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delhaize America is to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange,  
beginning Sept. 9. Food Lion will then discontinue its listing on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's deal, Food Lion will pay $79 in cash and stock for  
Hannaford, with payments totaling $2.7 billion in cash and about 
$650 million in stock. It also will assume about $300 million in 
Hannaford debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Hannaford stock was halted at $63.68 3/4 a share on Tuesday as  
rumors of a takeover circulated in markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Together, we are very complimentary companies, both  
operationally and geographically,'' Bill McCanless, president and 
chief executive officer of Food Lion, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The boards of directors of both companies have approved the  
merger. But the transaction must win antitrust clearance from 
regulators as well as approval from Hannaford shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Hannaford would maintain its headquarters in Scarborough and  
there would be no reduction in its work force, said Hugh G. 
Farrington, Hannaford president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrington would continue to operate the Hannaford division and  
would become vice chairman of Delhaize's board. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the road, the merged company is expected to save $40  
million in the first year and about $75 million by the third year 
by combining distribution, marketing, training and buying power, 
the companies said.

<HEADLINE> Serena Williams Exits With Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Serena Williams withdrew from the du Maurier Open  
today after injuring a shoulder during morning practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old strained her right rotator muscle and defaulted  
her second-round match against Silvija Tajala of Croatia. Williams 
had received a first-round bye. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury will be re-evaluated before the U.S. Open at the end  
of this month, but Williams, ranked eighth on the WTA Tour, is 
expected to be able to play.

<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China will not release 7-foot center Wang Zhizhi  
of the Bayi Rockets to play for the Dallas Mavericks, an official 
of the Chinese army team was quoted Wednesday as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nice thing that Wang was selected by Dallas at the NBA  
draft on June 30. But we can't let him go because it's not the 
right time either for our team or for Wang himself,'' the state-run 
Xinhua News Agency quoted Bayi's manager Qian Limin as saying.

<HEADLINE> Man Admits Selling Pistol to Teens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The man accused of supplying the Columbine  
High gunmen with their semiautomatic pistol pleaded guilty 
Wednesday, and also disclosed that he bought 100 rounds of 
ammunition for them the night before the bloodbath. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Steve Jensen said there was no evidence that Mark  
Manes, a 22-year-old computer programmer and Columbine graduate, 
knew what the teen-agers had planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes pleaded guilty to supplying a weapon to a minor and  
possession of a sawed-off shotgun. He faces one to 18 years in 
prison at sentencing Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, killed 12 fellow  
students, a teacher and themselves at Columbine High on April 20 in 
the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes bought the TEC-DC 9 at a gun show last fall and sold it to  
the teen-agers in January for $500. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes also told authorities Harris asked him to purchase the  
ammunition, Jensen said. Manes bought two boxes of 9 mm ammunition 
at a K-Mart, then drove to Harris' house and sold them to the 
teen-ager for $25. 
</P>
<P>
	The ammunition purchase -- which was not disclosed until  
Wednesday -- was legal, Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Ransome, Manes' lawyer, said his client pleaded guilty  
because ``the family wants to do the right thing.'' He said Manes 
was horrified by the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes had been to shooting ranges with Harris and Klebold before  
the attack. Ransome has said that it never crossed Manes' mind that 
they would go after their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes is one of two people accused of helping Harris and Klebold  
acquire the TEC-DC 9, one of four weapons used in the rampage. 
Philip Duran, a pizza shop employee who worked with Harris and 
Klebold, is accused of introducing the teen-agers to Manes. 
</P>
<P>
	Duran, 22, is charged with providing a gun to a minor, which  
carries up to six years in prison and a $500,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold also used two shotguns and a rifle legally  
purchased and given to them by Klebold's friend Robyn Anderson, 18.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin's Dayne Makes Heisman Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- College football's premier tailback spends  
most of his free time baby-sitting. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Dayne admits he's devoted to his infant daughter, Jada. She  
was a primary reason he passed on the riches of the NFL and 
returned to Wisconsin for his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a big part of my life,'' Dayne said, unable to suppress  
a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are other reasons Dayne is leading the No. 10 Badgers  
for one more year. He would like to write his name in the record 
books -- right at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	With 1,717 yards, Dayne could pass Texas' Ricky Williams and  
become major college football's career rushing leader. Williams 
claimed the record last season from Pittsburgh's Tony Dorsett. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time, I see a record that he's set as a goal,  
and that's important to him,'' coach Barry Alvarez said. ``He's 
really focused. He's a mature young man now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez has watched Dayne mature from an uncommunicative  
freshman into a quietly confident senior. Though he still isn't 
entirely comfortable with the attention continually heaped upon 
him, Dayne said he has learned to tolerate the many demands of 
being a superstar. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a skill he has applied to fatherhood.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know she's special to him,'' Alvarez said. ``He spends as  
much time with her as he possibly can, and he wants to be a good 
father. When a kid comes to your program as a raw 18-year-old, 
that's what you hope to see by the time he leaves you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne has little left to prove on the field. He rushed for 246  
yards and four touchdowns in Wisconsin's 38-31 win over UCLA in 
last January's Rose Bowl in an overwhelming performance that would 
have been a perfect cap to an extraordinary career. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dayne returned to Madison, which he said finally feels like  
home. He hibernated through the Wisconsin winter, setting his 
sights on the season to come and the records he will attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaching Williams' record is far from a sure thing. Every  
defense the Badgers play will be keyed to stopping Dayne, who 
hasn't rushed for more than 1,700 yards since his freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
	With 499 yards, Dayne will pass Ohio State's Archie Griffin to  
become the Big Ten's career rushing leader. Dayne also could become 
the first player to lead the conference in rushing three times. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's the Heisman hype. Williams, Griffin and Dorsett  
all won college football's top award, and Dayne is a front-runner 
for the 1999 trophy even before he has played a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of those things -- the records, the Heisman -- are things  
that happen when you're in a good team situation,'' Dayne said. 
``They're important because they prove that what you're doing as a 
team is working. You can be the best player on a bad team, and 
you're not going to win awards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 253-pound Dayne has been prone to minor injuries during his  
years at Wisconsin, but he is in top shape entering the fall. He is 
running behind an offensive line that lost two starters, including 
mammoth right tackle Aaron Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive coordinator and running backs coach Brian White said  
the Badgers' primary offensive strategy -- give it to Dayne and get 
out of the way -- won't be difficult for opponents to figure out. 
Stopping it will be another thing entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron has had to earn every bit of respect he gets in the Big  
Ten,'' White said. ``You play to your strengths as a football team, 
and Ron is our strength, no question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Dayne feels his greatest accomplishment this season  
might be leading the Badgers to another Big Ten title, an 
exceedingly tall order in a conference this competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody talks about the rushing record, and that would be  
good, but I'm more concerned about winning,'' Dayne said. ``That 
feeling we had at the Rose Bowl last season was the best feeling 
I've ever had that wasn't about my daughter.''

<HEADLINE> Woods, Garcia To Duel Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASTLE ROCK, Colo. (AP) -- A mere 23 years of age and in only his  
third full season on the PGA Tour, Tiger Woods already is having to 
fend off challenges from the younger set. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was bound to happen,'' Woods said Wednesday with a laugh  
and without a trace of wistfulness. ``You can't be the young guy on 
the block forever. I welcome that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods staged a riveting duel with 19-year-old Sergio Garcia in  
the final round of the PGA Championship on Sunday, edging the 
swashbuckling Spaniard by a stroke. The two young guns will hook up 
again this week in the Sprint International, which begins Thursday 
at Castle Pines Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The event features eight of the world's top 10 players,  
including No. 1 Woods, No. 2 David Duval and No. 3 Davis Love III. 
</P>
<P>
	Also contending are fifth-ranked Lee Westwood; No. 6 Vijay  
Singh, the defending champion; No. 8 Ernie Els; No. 9 Mark O'Meara 
and No. 10 Nick Price. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, who got his driver's license just last month, ranks only  
31st in the world because of having played a limited number of 
tournaments. But his performance last week -- he was the youngest 
runnerup in PGA Championship history -- clinched a berth on the 1999 
European Ryder Cup team and galvanized the sport like no one since, 
well, Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Drawing a reaction usually reserved for rock stars, Garcia was  
mobbed by autograph seekers -- most of them kids -- after Tuesday's 
practice round here and again before Wednesday's pro-am. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an extension of the gallery support he received on Sunday  
at Medinah, when the crowd became more pro-Garcia than pro-Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it was the largest crowd I have played in  
front of,'' Garcia said, ``but it was one of the best. A crowd has 
never pushed me and helped me as much as they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, asked if Garcia's sudden popularity will relieve some of  
the pressure that has been on him since 1996, said, ``No doubt 
about it. Now, he is getting the galleries and the attention, the 
media coverage. When I first came out, it was very tough to focus 
on golf and budget your time with all the demands on it. David 
(Duval) went through the same thing. Now Sergio is starting to find 
that out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia's shot from the base of a tree on the 16th hole on Sunday  
-- and his dash up the fairway and leap to see the ball reach the 
green -- will be a highlight of the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods doubted that Garcia, who also jokes and appears to be  
genuinely having a good time on the course, can maintain that 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if he can play with such emotion day to day for  
12 months,'' Woods said. ``Speaking from my own experience, I 
couldn't. I remember in 1997 I was still a very emotional player, 
but by the time I got to just past the U.S. Open, I was worn out 
because I had never played that much golf in my life. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me to last for 12 months, I had to be a little more  
subdued on the golf course. I don't have the highs and lows like I 
used to, and hence I can last for 12 months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who finished fourth in his first International last year,  
liked his chances here because of his length off the tee and his 
ability to make birdies, which are rewarded under the modified 
Stableford scoring system used in this event. A player gets 5 
points for an eagle, 2 for birdie, 0 for par, minus-1 for bogey and 
minus-3 for double bogey or worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those weeks that I can thoroughly enjoy because  
you can stretch it out there,'' he said. ``You can be aggressive. 
In fact, you have to be aggressive. You have to get birdies and 
hopefully a few eagles along the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, meanwhile, was still adjusting to Castle Pines'  
6,200-foot elevation, which causes shots to fly 10-15 percent 
farther than at sea level. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last week I was hitting a 3-wood about 260 yards,'' Garcia  
said. ``Today I hit a 3-iron that went 280 almost. I'm sure I am 
going to hit some shots over the green. We're not used to playing 
here, but it will probably affect me a little more because it is my 
first time playing here.''

<HEADLINE> Cassini Probe Gets by Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The plutonium-powered Cassini spacecraft flew  
within 728 miles of Earth's surface, successfully using the 
planet's gravity to gain speed and change direction for the final 
stretch of its journey to Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft made its closest  
approach to Earth late Tuesday, arriving within three miles of its 
target and six-tenths of a second late -- all within an acceptable 
margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was right by the book,'' said Bob Mitchell, Cassini's  
program manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	But concern over the safety of nuclear-powered spacecraft are  
not likely to diminish as the $3.4 billion Cassini speeds away. 
Anti-nuclear activists plan to protest any future missions that use 
radioactive materials. 
</P>
<P>
	``The odds are with space technology you're going to have an  
accident sooner or later,'' said Bruce Gagnon of the Global Network 
Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space. ``God forbid it's on a 
mission with plutonium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Activists had feared that human error or some other mishap could  
fling Cassini and its 72 pounds of radioactive plutonium into 
Earth's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of demonstrations took place in June to protest the  
flyby, but most activists conceded nothing could be done to prevent 
it. Before Cassini's launch, protesters filed lawsuits and 
threatened to chain themselves to the pad. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA experts said there was only a 1-in-1.2 million chance of  
accidental re-entry. And even if that happened, the plutonium was 
well-protected, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The robotic probe reached its closest point over the  
southeastern Pacific Ocean as expected at 8:28 p.m. The 
spacecraft's closest point was nearly 110 times higher than 
commercial jets normally cruise. 
</P>
<P>
	The swingby was designed to give the spacecraft momentum for the  
remainder of its trip, and the mission would have been impossible 
without the gravity assistance of Earth and other planets, Mitchell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassini has twice used the gravity of Venus to increase its  
speed since its launch in October 1997. In December 2000, it will 
swing by Jupiter for a final push toward Saturn and its moons, 
which the probe will study for four years beginning in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has used ``gravity assists'' of Earth and Venus since 1973  
to fling other spacecraft to their destinations, including the 
successful -- and plutonium-powered -- Galileo probe to Jupiter. 
Galileo twice flew close to Earth without incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassini doesn't use the plutonium for propulsion but to power  
its dozen instruments. Heat from the naturally decaying element is 
converted into electricity in the craft's three nuclear batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Once it arrives at Saturn, Cassini will make close-up studies of  
the planet, its rings, moons and magnetic environment. It also will 
release a European Space Agency probe named Huygens, which will 
parachute to the surface of Titan, Saturn's biggest moon.

<HEADLINE> Honda To Recall 115,000 Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Honda Motor Co. will recall 114,913 cars exported  
from Japan, including about 95,000 Acuras in the United States, to 
replace potentially defective transmission bolts that can become 
disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States and Canada, the recall affects some 1996-99  
model-year Acura RLs and some 1996-98 Acura 3.2 TLs, Honda 
spokesman Andy Boyd said Wednesday. Honda did not say how many of 
the Acuras are being recalled in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, where the cars are sold as the Honda Legend, Inspire  
and Saber, 29,060 vehicles are being recalled for the same reason. 
Additional cars are being recalled in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda will notify owners of the cars in the United States by  
mail starting at the end of this month, Boyd said. Dealers will 
replace the differential sealing bolts that connect with drive axle 
and the differential, the set of gears that allows more power to go 
to one wheel than the other in a turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyd said no accidents or injuries have been reported as a  
result of the defect. In most cases, the axle and differential 
became disconnected and the car would not move. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda did not say how much the recall will cost.

<HEADLINE> Phils' Brogna Signs New Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Rico Brogna signed his second one-year contract  
extension in two years with the Philadelphia Phillies on Wednesday, 
this one for a base salary of $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Brogna, 29, also got a $200,000 signing bonus. He was batting  
.268 with 15 home runs and 68 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rico has been a big part of the club the last three years,''  
general manager Ed Wade said. ``He's done a great job for us and 
we're happy to be able to reward him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies acquired Brogna from the New York Mets on Nov. 11,  
1996, for pitchers Toby Borland and Ricardo Jordan. He had career 
highs for games played, runs, hits, doubles and RBIs in each of his 
first two seasons with the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Since joining the Phillies, he had a combined average of .260  
with 55 homers and 253 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rico has worked himself into being a consummate  
professional,'' manager Terry Francona said. ``I appreciate him, 
the coaches appreciate him and his teammates appreciate all he 
brings to the ballclub.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Brogna signed a one-year extension on Aug. 11.

<HEADLINE> Cyberwar Threatens Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- An international squad of computer  
hackers will wreak electronic mayhem on Indonesia if the country 
hampers voting in East Timor's independence referendum, a Nobel 
Peace Prize laureate warned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than 100 computer wizards, mostly teen-agers in Portugal,  
Spain, Ireland, Belgium, Brazil, the U.S. and Canada, ... are 
targeting the entire computer network of the Indonesian government, 
army, banking and finance institutions to create chaos,'' Jose 
Ramos Horta wrote in a newspaper commentary published Wednesday 
</P>
<P>
	``A dozen special viruses are being designed to infect the  
Indonesian electronic-communications system, including aviation,'' 
said Horta, an East Timorese leader who was co-winner of the 1996 
Nobel Peace prize. 
</P>
<P>
	His commentary was published in the Thai newspaper The Nation  
and Australia's Sydney Morning Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N.-supervised referendum scheduled for Aug. 30 will give  
East Timor's people a choice between full independence from 
Indonesia or becoming an autonomous region within the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia occupied the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and East  
Timor has been wracked by guerrilla warfare and human rights abuses 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Horta said if the referendum was unfair, the independence  
movement would also try to hurt Indonesia's tourist industry by 
organizing a worldwide campaign to boycott the resort island of 
Bali. 
</P>
<P>
	Horta wrote that he believed a free vote in the referendum would  
show ``an overwhelming majority of East Timorese'' favoring 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the conditions on the ground remain far from appropriate  
for a free and democratic ballot to take place,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted the eruption of full-scale violence before or after  
the ballot and accused the army of ``clinging to the illusion that 
through terror and fraud'' it can ensure independence will be voted 
down. 
</P>

	Indonesia itself has been accused of waging cyberwar against the  
East Timorese.

<P>
	In January, the Irish Internet service provider Connect-Ireland,  
which hosted a pro-independence East Timor website, was the target 
of a coordinated attack from as many as 18 different points. The 
company had said it suspected the Indonesian government was behind 
the attack.

<P>
	In early 1997, Portuguese hackers broke into the Web sites of  
the Indonesian military and foreign ministry and defaced their 
websites with pro-independence propaganda.

<HEADLINE> Elizabeth Dole Keeps Plugging Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Given a new lease on political life, Elizabeth  
Dole laid out a simple fall strategy as she launched a West Coast 
fund-raising swing: ``Just keep moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She promised to roll out the ideas on crime, drugs, taxes and  
education to prove herself more qualified than George W. Bush to 
head the GOP ticket in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But the more electable she looks, the more she battles whispers  
-- within her own camp, even -- that the vice presidential nomination 
is her Plan B. 
</P>
<P>
	After a dismal spring of organizational disarray and sinking  
poll numbers, aides felt vindicated when Dole placed a strong third 
behind Bush and Steve Forbes in a GOP presidential straw poll in 
Ames, Iowa, last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of confirmation that we made the right choice,''  
said Dole's finance committee chairwoman, Bonnie McElveen-Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Bush campaign co-chairman Haley Barbour, former head of the  
Republican Party, allowed: ``Ames is a vivid reminder that there is 
a huge appetite out there for Elizabeth Dole's candidacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of Saturday's Iowa vote, telephone operators at her  
northern Virginia headquarters logged a record 250 cold calls from 
Monday morning to Wednesday afternoon -- half of them from wannabe 
volunteers, half from people asking where to send their cash 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidate herself downplayed the splash. ``It can't hurt to  
have had a strong position in the top three,'' she said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just keep moving.''  
</P>
<P>
	Some in her circle of Washington staff and advisers, with an eye  
on Bush's formidable bankroll and poll numbers, said privately that 
if Dole can keep the momentum going into the winter primaries, she 
cements herself a fallback position by forcing Bush to make her his 
running mate. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's strong appeal among women already makes her a must-have  
on any Republican ticket hoping to overcome the GOP's gaping 
deficit to Democrats when it comes to female voters. 
</P>
<P>
	One top Bush operative, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
flipped the Dole team's postulate inside out, saying that if Dole 
now does poorly in the primaries, she loses any chance of joining a 
Bush ticket. She would have a more guaranteed shot, this person 
said, had she stayed out of the race, keeping her mystique and 
celebrity unblemished. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's press secretary, Ari Fleischer, called the talk of No. 2  
``inevitable chitchat in political circles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the better she does, the more the chitchat will  
grow. But she's running for one position and one position only, and 
she's running to win,'' Fleischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole herself seems to strain to keep the competition with Bush  
congenial, which only feeds theories that she wants to burn no 
bridges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing personal,'' she said, painting herself as a workhorse  
candidate keeping her head down. When arguing her point that Bush 
is less qualified than she for the White House, Dole gently poked 
at him not by name but as ``one other candidate I can think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her fall unveiling of policy initiatives ``will just be a matter  
of comparing records,'' she told The Associated Press in an 
interview Wednesday between connecting flights to a $1,000-a-head 
reception with about 75 Utah contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	There were traces of resentment over Bush's whopping lead and  
his ``gobs of money,'' as she called it. 
</P>
<P>
	Strategist Tony Fabrizio put more of an edge on the strategy to  
show substance on issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll draw a very, very clear line in the sand ... and force,  
if we can, a discussion with George W. Bush. If he chooses to 
remain silent, he gives Mrs. Dole a wide open field,'' Fabrizio 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole is rushing out two fund-raising appeals this week that  
boast of her Iowa showing and ask for the money to keep going. 
Aides said she will probably move up -- from October to September -- 
a planned fall kickoff from her hometown of Salisbury, N.C. And she 
looked ahead to a dizzy pace of 25 fund-raisers in the next 45 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican strategist close to her campaign said that when  
the next finance reports are filed Sept. 30 she'll need to bring 
her fund-raising tally to at least $5 million to remain a credible 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
	She raised $3.5 million in the first six months of this year.  
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Dole promised ``more surprises'' but not until  
after time off next week with her husband, former Sen. Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been almost, virtually two months on the road nonstop,''  
she said with some weariness. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good time to pull away from politics for a while ...  
put our feet up, watch movies, talk to people who might be helpful 
with fund raising and whatever. When Labor Day hits, the whole 
campaign goes into high gear.''

<HEADLINE> Island Evacuated Due to Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSTON ISLAND (AP) -- A weakening Hurricane Dora churned west  
into the central Pacific Ocean after passing near this little 
island and its chemical weapons incinerator run by the United 
States military. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was on Johnston Island when Hurricane Dora passed about  
75 miles south of the atoll Tuesday night. All 1,100 military and 
civilian personnel had been evacuated to Hawaii, 825 miles to the 
northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds of only 25 mph to 30 mph with gusts up to 45 mph extended  
from the storm over the island, said National Weather Service 
forecaster Hans Rosendal. The storm earlier had sustained winds of 
85 mph as it headed toward the island, part of a four-island atoll 
that is a U.S. possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was too far away and too weak to give the island much of a  
lashing,'' Rosendal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force planes were to fly over the island today to assess any  
damage, said Army spokesman John Fairbank. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanks and lines in the incinerator were closed, and remaining  
weapons were secured in earth-covered bunkers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The facility was designed, built and maintained to withstand  
tropical storms. It is extremely safe from mishaps,'' said Army 
Maj. Bruce Foreman, executive officer of the 185-member Army 
security and support force on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The incinerator has not been in operation since July when the  
last of some mustard gas was burned, he said. It is in the process 
of being cleaned and reconfigured for the next disposal project. 
The facility is scheduled to be closed next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding was a chief concern because the atoll has a high point  
of only 7 feet. Waves of up to 12 feet were forecast on the island, 
which is two miles long and a quarter-mile wide. 
</P>
<P>
	The other three islands are a national wildlife refuge and home  
to about 150,000 sea birds, which are now in the reproduction 
process. Hatchlings and recently-laid eggs were not expected to 
survive, said Robert Smith, manager of the Pacific island 
ecological services office. 
</P>
<P>
	However, after Hurricane John swept through the atoll five years  
ago, city terns, which make up 80 percent of the local bird 
population, recolonized within days, said Dave Johnson of the 
Pacific Islands National Wildlife Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 hurricane caused up to $15 million in damage and forced  
a one-month shutdown of the incinerator.

<HEADLINE> Reduced Sentence for Lyons Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- A judge refused Wednesday to reduce  
the 5 1/2-year state prison sentence for the Rev. Henry Lyons, the 
former leader of a large and influential black church denomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Susan Schaeffer wasn't swayed by scores of letters  
and pleas from pastors, church members and relatives seeking mercy 
for Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said the sentence for racketeering and grand theft was  
fair and took into consideration Lyons' good deeds. He could have 
been sentenced to eight years and one month. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, former president of the National Baptist Convention USA,  
was convicted Feb. 27 of swindling $4 million from businesses. He 
also was found guilty of stealing nearly $250,000 donated by the 
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith to rebuild burned black 
churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced to four years and three months on federal bank  
fraud and tax evasion charges, but that term is being served 
concurrently with the state sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, 57, now works in a prison library.  
</P>
<P>
	``Thirteen days alone in a 5 x 8 hotbox tested me and my faith.  
Thank God my faith held,'' Lyons wrote in a three-page letter to 
the judge, describing his first days of confinement. ``My lessons 
here in prison are hard and well learned and earned.''

<HEADLINE>  Riley Says Miami Job is Long-Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Pat Riley, the NBA's second-winningest coach,  
reached an agreement Wednesday with the Miami Heat that will keep 
him in charge of the team well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	In keeping with club policy, no terms of the agreement were  
disclosed. Riley also serves as team president, overseeing all 
aspects of the club's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family and I have fallen in love with Miami and we hope  
that this is the final destination of a long coaching journey,'' 
Riley said in a statement announcing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley, who came to Miami in 1995 and has taken the Heat to the  
playoffs in each of his four seasons, has not missed the postseason 
in 17 seasons as an NBA coach. The Heat is 191-105 during Riley's 
years with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami has won the past three Atlantic Division titles under  
Riley, who orchestrated trades early in his tenure to land center 
Alonzo Mourning, and point guard Tim Hardaway. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Heat has suffered first-round playoff exits in each  
of the past two seasons. This year, the Heat owned the Eastern 
Conference's best record but became the first East top seed to not 
reach the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have much to do in the coming years, with our main  
objective forever and always being the building of a championship 
team,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The closest Miami has come to the NBA Finals was in 1997, when  
they reached the Eastern Conference finals before losing to the 
eventual champion Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am delighted that Pat has decided to firmly plant his  
coaching and family roots here in Miami,'' Heat managing general 
partner Micky Arison said. ``We have developed a great relationship 
over the past four years and have found our passion for the game 
and desire to win a championship for Miami greater than ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley owns a career record of 947-404, trailing only Lenny  
Wilkens on the career list. His 149 playoff victories are an NBA 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley coached the Los Angeles Lakers to four NBA championships  
in the 1980s and also led the New York Knicks to the 1994 finals.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Prices Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stocks markets closed mostly higher  
Wednesday, after news of a mild increase in U.S. consumer prices 
suggested any rise in U.S. interest rates likely would be slight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose for the eighth  
consecutive session on strong showings by several blue chips, 
although the gains were modest as traders worried the rally was 
losing steam. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei rose 32.17 points, or 0.18 percent, to 17,892.26. The  
average had gained 34.06 points, or 0.19 percent, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that only a limited group of issues have gained in  
recent sessions overshadows upside prospects for the overall 
market,'' said Masatoshi Sato, manager of investment information at 
Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 209.94 points, or 1.6  
percent, to 12,993.10 as traders were cheered by the prospect that 
interest rates would not jump sharply. On Tuesday, the Hang Seng 
had fallen 0.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rate movements in Hong Kong usually track those in the  
United States to maintain Hong Kong's currency pegged to the U.S. 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore shares also rallied, with the U.S. inflation data  
giving some of the impetus. The Straits Times Index rose 65.36 
points, or 3.3 percent, to 2,048.88. 
</P>
<P>
	Bangkok shares bucked the regional trend, dropping to a  
four-month low after the Thai central bank released figures showing 
that the number of bad loans has not gone down recently. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand index lost 1.55 points, or 0.4  
percent, to 409.76. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar fell to a six-month low  
against the Japanese yen amid fading expectations that Japan will 
intervene to halt a potentially damaging rise in its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In late dealings, the dollar was trading at 113.08 yen, down  
1.52 yen from its level late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its 
overnight level in New York of 114.05 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares rose on late buying in some blue  
chips, as the currency, the rupiah, rose against the U.S. dollar. 
The JSX Composite index rose 0.884 point, or 0.16 percent, to 
561.365. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares rallied on investors'  
anticipation of positive second quarter economic growth figures. 
The Composite Index closed at 760.80 points, up 1.2 percent, or

</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: South Korea's Kospi index closed down 0.5 percent, or

<HEADLINE> Justice May Not Take On Starr Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr  
has been told by Justice Department officials that, if he were to 
leave office, they probably would be unable to take over his 
unfinished investigation of President Clinton and his wife, 
Hillary, a Justice Department official says. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's never said to us, 'I'm leaving,''' said the official, who  
spoke late Tuesday only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	But Starr's staff has had theoretical discussions with Justice  
Department attorneys about how his unfinished work would be handled 
if he left, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr, whose five-year investigation of the Clintons led to the  
first impeachment of a president since Andrew Johnson in 1868, 
resigned once before, in February 1997, to take a job at Pepperdine 
University in California. But he rescinded it within days after 
coming under heavy criticism for leaving the post before his 
investigation was completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department official said Starr's aides and the  
department's staff attorneys had discussed the possibility and 
ramifications of referring the unfinished investigation back to the 
Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said that was probably impossible given the kind of things  
he's investigating,'' the official said. ``We said we would either 
have to decline to accept them or seek a new independent counsel or 
special counsel to complete the work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office would not comment Tuesday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Among the ongoing subjects of Starr's investigation is first  
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's work in the 1980s as a private lawyer 
on a fraudulent Arkansas land deal that played a role in the 
insolvency of a Little Rock, Ark., savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's inquiry was expanded by Attorney General Janet Reno to  
include a controversy about the Clinton White House's use of FBI 
files, possible lies by presidential aides in the White House 
travel office firings and the Monica Lewinsky sex and cover-up 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said last week he hoped to wrap up the investigation and  
write a final report at the ``earliest practicable moment.'' He 
told reporters he expected the work to be completed before the 
general election in November 2000, when Mrs. Clinton likely will be 
the Democratic nominee for a U.S. Senate seat from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation's status, should Starr resign, is murky  
because the independent counsel law expired at the end of June. The 
act provided that Starr and any other existing independent counsel 
could complete their work but did not specify what was to happen if 
a counsel resigned once the act expired and the work wasn't 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
	All the matters Starr has been investigating were initially  
referred to the independent counsel to avoid a conflict of interest 
if investigated by the Justice Department. The Justice official 
said the now-expired act allowed an independent counsel to refer 
cases back to the department only when they were ``substantially 
completed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If any independent counsel chose to step down before an  
investigation were completed, it might raise questions we would 
want to address,'' said Myron Marlin, a Justice Department 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the act's silence, there would be a certain logic in  
Starr asking the three-judge panel that selected him to name a 
successor, one Justice Department official said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's investigation of Clinton's relationship with Ms.  
Lewinsky led to the president's impeachment by the House and 
subsequent acquittal by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's report to the House on possible impeachable offenses  
found ``substantial and credible evidence'' of perjury and 
obstruction by the president. After a trial, the Senate voted not 
to remove Clinton from office.

<HEADLINE> New Illinois Track Is Challenging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- Juan Montoya looked over at teammate Jimmy  
Vasser and rival Michael Andretti and chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is in the same boat this week,'' Montoya said,  
looking around the gleaming new Chicago Motor Speedway on 
Wednesday. ``Nobody knows this track yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya, the sensational rookie, came to the CART series from  
Formula 3000 in Europe and has had to learn the nuances of every 
track this season. He has done it well enough to sit second in the 
driver standings, trailing third-year driver Dario Franchitti by 
one point heading into Sunday's inaugural Target Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than two slow laps by Montoya in an earlier press day and  
one on Wednesday, nobody has had a chance to try the wide, smooth 
one-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	The track, the first built in Chicago in more than a  
half-century, is on the site of thoroughbred racing's Sportsman's 
Park in this western Chicago suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	The track is squeezed between train tracks on one side and the  
Hawthorn Park harness track on the other. The skyscrapers of 
downtown Chicago, seven miles away, are visible from the infield 
and the immediate neighborhood is a mixed bag, with homes and 
apartments mingled with businesses and abandoned factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the single massive grandstand, which seats 65,000, is  
new, with 56 luxury suites, plenty of corporate hospitality areas 
and spectacular views of the asphalt oval from virtually every 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's media day was the first chance for most of the  
drivers to look over CMS. The biggest concern wasn't the view. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this track is going to be great for racing,'' Montoya  
said. ``It's wide and smooth. Out there alone, it's very, very 
wide. Racing in traffic could be completely different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti, considered one of the best oval racers in the CART  
series, said, ``Until we get out there, you really don't know, but 
it looks like it's going to be a great racetrack. I love small 
ovals and this one looks wide enough in the turns to make an 
outside pass and the straightaways are long enough to get a good 
run going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chip Ganassi, owner of the team for which Montoya and former  
series champion Vasser drive, is also the president of the track. 
It was Ganassi who contacted Charles Bidwell II, owner of 
Sportsman's Park, with the idea just 14 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thankfully, Charley is a race fan,'' Ganassi said. ``He told  
me right away he had season tickets to Michigan Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``My idea was to try to combine the simplicity of an oval with  
the excitement of a temporary city circuit like Long Beach or 
Toronto. We're trying to get the best of both worlds, and I think 
we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bidwell said Ganassi's call came right when he was trying to  
figure how to fill the days when horses weren't racing at the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``The challenge was to keep the horses here. We had to take down  
our barns and make a deal with our neighbor, Hawthorn, to lease 
their barns. But that wasn't a big problem because we've been 
sharing barns with them for 40 years anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the horses do run at Chicago Motor Speedway, it will be on  
the pit lane and warmup lane that parallels the one-mile oval. A 
rubber base topped by gravel and dirt will be trucked in to form 
the horse track. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning with practice on Thursday, though, the only horses at  
the track will be in the form of 800-horsepower Champ Car engines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dario and Michael both are very strong right now,'' Montoya  
said. ``Michael is great on ovals and I'm sure he's going to be 
very good here. And I think we will be good here, too. Chip would 
like to see us win the first one here.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Talked To Company Under Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush acknowledged Wednesday  
he talked briefly with the head of a funeral home company while it 
was being investigated by the state, but he said there was no 
discussion of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a 20-second conversation. I had no substantive  
conversation with the guy,'' said Bush, a GOP presidential 
candidate. ``Twenty seconds. That's hardly enough time to even say 
hello, much less sit down and have a substantive discussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Bush spoke with the head of Service Corp. International  
while its embalming practices were being investigated has become an 
issue because of a whistleblower lawsuit filed by the former head 
of the state agency that handled the probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Eliza May, the former head of the Texas Funeral Service  
Commission, contends she was fired because of the investigation. 
Bush is not a defendant, but she has subpoenaed him and filed a 
motion Wednesday seeking to have him declared in contempt of court 
for saying he had no contact with the company's officials about the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's spokeswoman, Linda Edwards, dismissed the contempt motion  
as ``nothing more than a publicity stunt.'' Bush called the case 
frivolous and said it was politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May is a former treasurer of the state Democratic Party.  
</P>
<P>
	She contends she was fired from the funeral home regulatory  
agency in February after the investigation of Service Corp. 
International, which has donated money to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry resulted in a recommended fine of $445,000. SCI is  
fighting the fine and says the agency misinterpreted state 
embalming law. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May is suing the Funeral Service Commission, SCI and SCI  
founder and chairman Robert Waltrip. She says SCI's political 
action committee and Waltrip gave Bush $45,000 in gubernatorial 
campaign contributions, and Waltrip is a longtime Bush family 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Her contempt motion accused Bush of making ``false, misleading  
and deceptive'' statements in an affidavit in which he said he 
``had no conversations with SCI officials, agents, or 
representatives concerning the investigation or any dispute arising 
from it'' and ``no personal knowledge of relevant facts of the 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May says she was called into the office of Joe Allbaugh,  
Bush's executive assistant, and asked to explain inspections on 
April 10, 1998, at two SCI affiliates. Allbaugh now manages Bush's 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In the contempt motion, Ms. May's lawyers cite a Newsweek  
magazine article that recounted a conversation between Bush and 
Waltrip on April 15, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip and SCI lobbyist Johnnie B. Rogers had come to the  
governor's office to give Allbaugh a copy of a letter, addressed to 
the head of the Funeral Service Commission, that complained of 
tactics being used in the investigation, SCI spokesman Bill Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Waltrip and Rogers were waiting to give a copy to  
Allbaugh when Bush walked out, on his way elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek reported that, according to Rogers, Bush said to  
Waltrip, ``Hey Bobby, are those people still messing with you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Waltrip responded yes, the magazine reported, Rogers said  
the governor turned to him and said: ``Hey, Johnnie B. Are you 
taking care of him?'' Rogers said he replied, ``I'm doing my best, 
governor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers hasn't returned calls from The Associated Press. Bush  
said he doesn't remember what was said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is it lasted no time. And that hardly constitutes a  
serious discussion,'' Bush said. ``I did not have any knowledge at 
all of Waltrip's problem with this case.''

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Prices Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stocks markets closed mostly higher  
Wednesday, after news of a mild increase in U.S. consumer prices 
suggested any rise in U.S. interest rates likely would be slight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose for the eighth  
consecutive session on strong showings by several blue chips, 
although the gains were modest as traders worried the rally was 
losing steam. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei rose 32.17 points, or 0.18 percent, to 17,892.26. The  
average had gained 34.06 points, or 0.19 percent, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that only a limited group of issues have gained in  
recent sessions overshadows upside prospects for the overall 
market,'' said Masatoshi Sato, manager of investment information at 
Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 209.94 points, or 1.6  
percent, to 12,993.10 as traders were cheered by the prospect that 
interest rates would not jump sharply. On Tuesday, the Hang Seng 
had fallen 0.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rate movements in Hong Kong usually track those in the  
United States to maintain Hong Kong's currency pegged to the U.S. 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore shares also rallied, with the U.S. inflation data  
giving some of the impetus. The Straits Times Index rose 65.36 
points, or 3.3 percent, to 2,048.88. 
</P>
<P>
	Bangkok shares bucked the regional trend, dropping to a  
four-month low after the Thai central bank released figures showing 
that the number of bad loans has not gone down recently. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand index lost 1.55 points, or 0.4  
percent, to 409.76. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar fell to a six-month low  
against the Japanese yen amid fading expectations that Japan will 
intervene to halt a potentially damaging rise in its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In late dealings, the dollar was trading at 113.08 yen, down  
1.52 yen from its level late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its 
overnight level in New York of 114.05 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares rose on late buying in some blue  
chips, as the currency, the rupiah, rose against the U.S. dollar. 
The JSX Composite index rose 0.884 point, or 0.16 percent, to 
561.365. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares rallied on investors'  
anticipation of positive second quarter economic growth figures. 
The Composite Index closed at 760.80 points, up 1.2 percent, or 
9.33 points. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks rose on the U.S. inflation data, after  
a 4.1 percent slump on Tuesday. The PSE index rose 17.96 points, or 
0.9 percent, to 2,105.09. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: South Korea's Kospi index closed down 0.5 percent, or  
4.76 points, at 868.94 points, after an early fall of more than 2 
percent on Daewoo Group's financial woes. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares rose, buoyed by gains on Wall Street.  
The All Ordinaries Index rose 1.3 percent, or 38.0 points, to 
3,026.0. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwan shares fell back, after soaring 18.5 percent in  
the nine previous sessions. The Weighted Price Index fell 89.72 
points, or 1.1 percent, to 7,993.71. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares rose, buoyed by a raft of  
favorable corporate earnings results. The NZSE-40 Capital Index 
rose 9.66 points, or 0.44 percent, to 2,198.05.

<HEADLINE>  Redskins Coax Fryar From Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FROSTBURG, Md. (AP) -- The Washington Redskins have agreed to  
terms with receiver Irving Fryar, luring the five-time Pro Bowl 
receiver out of retirement, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The signing's a foregone conclusion,'' a team source, speaking  
on the condition of anonymity, said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said Fryar could come as early as Thursday and that  
he could be in uniform for Friday's home exhibition game against 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Irving retired at the end of last season after a 15-year career  
with New England, Miami and Philadelphia. He has since been working 
as a football analyst at WPVI-TV in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to sign, definitely,'' WPVI sports director  
Gary Papa said. ``They've worked out some preliminary numbers. They 
told him they want to make him their third-down receiver. He likes 
it because it's close to his home, it's a grass field and he likes 
the offense. He feels like he can end his career on a better note 
than he did last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins have been courting Fryar for months, and  
negotiations intensified in recent weeks. Papa said Fryar finally 
agreed Tuesday to come back, left for Washington on Wednesday and 
had a physical and tryout scheduled at Redskin Park on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the agreement were not available. Neither Fryar nor his  
agent, Michael George, were available for comment. Redskins 
director of player personnel Vinny Cerrato would only say that the 
Redskins were in negotiations with Fryar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins have Michael Westbrook and Albert Connell as their  
starting receivers, but neither is a proven 16-game performer. 
However, Fryar will initially compete with James Thrash and Chris 
Thomas for the No. 3 spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryar, who will turn 37 next month, caught 46 passes for 556  
yards with the Eagles last season. He last made the Pro Bowl in 
1997, when he had 86 receptions for Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryar became a free agent at the end of last season because he  
did not meet performance incentives needed for a contract extension 
with the Eagles. He said didn't want to play anywhere else because 
it would mean moving his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't change my mind. I'm done. I am done,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fryar isn't the only retiree who could be suiting up for the  
Redskins soon. The source said negotiations continue with defensive 
end Chris Doleman, who quit at the end of last year despite a 
15-sack season with San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be a 1-2 punch,'' the source said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Shifts on Assault Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The state attorney general has agreed  
to drop an appeal of a lawsuit over gun registration, clearing the 
way for the state to order owners of about 1,600 assault weapons to 
give them to law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Bill Lockyer will ask the Legislature to  
provide funding to compensate owners who turn in the weapons, 
valued at $750 to $1,500 each, spokesman Nathan Barankin said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1989 state law prohibited the sale and possession of 62 models  
of military-style assault weapons. But it let residents who owned 
the weapons at that time keep them if they registered them with the 
state by March 30, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockyer's predecessor, Dan Lungren, let people who owned the  
guns before June 1989 register them without prosecution or 
confiscation after the 1992 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 50,000 assault weapons were registered by the deadline.  
</P>
<P>
	Handgun Control and the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence sued  
Lungren and won a ruling from a San Francisco judge in 1997 that 
any registration of the banned weapons after March 1992 was 
invalid. Lungren appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockyer, a Democrat who succeeded the Republican Lungren as  
attorney general eight months ago, plans to ask a state appeals 
court this week to approve the settlement, Barankin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lungren did not respond to a message left Tuesday on his home  
answering machine by The Associated Press seeking comment on 
Lockyer's decision.

<HEADLINE> Asian Hot Spots Command Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While conflicts have subsided elsewhere, it's  
been a hot, dangerous summer for Asia -- with confrontations brewing 
in the Taiwan Strait, on the Korean peninsula and on the Indian 
subcontinent. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Clinton administration is mindful that any one of these  
trouble spots might suddenly burst into a full-fledged crisis that 
could involve the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflicts:  
</P>
<P>
	--North Korea seems on the verge of launching another ballistic  
missile, which could further destabilize the region and increase 
weapons proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
	--China could move against Taiwanese territory, perhaps one of  
the offshore islands claimed by Taiwan, in response to what it sees 
as provocative sovereignty claims from Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
	--An escalation of fighting between India and Pakistan could  
bring them to the brink of a nuclear war. Both militaries have gone 
on high alert recently and India announced Tuesday a new nuclear 
deterrent plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Other world conflicts have quieted -- for now.  
</P>
<P>
	Peacekeeping operations are progressing in Kosovo, U.S.-British  
air skirmishes with Iraq have settled in at relative low levels, 
and even the bloody 15-month war between Ethiopia and Eritrea 
appears to be winding down. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, foreign policy has hardly been a blip on the radar  
screens of the 2000 U.S. presidential and congressional campaigns, 
although Republicans still hope to turn alleged Chinese nuclear 
espionage into a campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Probably the most imminent tension-raiser is North Korea, which  
may soon test its Taepodong 2 missile. With a believed range of 
3,750 miles, it could theoretically reach Hawaii or Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea last August launched a ballistic missile over Japan  
that landed in the Pacific. The United States fears the test of an 
even longer-range missile would further destabilize the peninsula 
and increase pressure in South Korea and Japan for missile-defense 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have offered North Korea economic incentives in  
exchange for an agreement to end missile development and other 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
	But intelligence reports suggest North Korea may be only days  
from launching a test. ``We don't know whether one's going to occur 
or not at this stage,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Taylor, director of political-military studies at the  
Center for Strategic and International Studies, sees such a missile 
test as ``pretty imminent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The long-isolated North Korea regime has little to lose, from  
its vantage point, from testing and improving its missile 
capability, Taylor suggested. ``In a war between the North and the 
South, would North Korea resort to using its missiles? The answer 
is yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And while North Korea is destined to lose such a war, he said,  
``it could do devastating damage to South Korea'' in the process. 
About 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	As to China, any military offensive toward Taiwan could directly  
entangle the United States. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act includes 
a U.S. commitment to come to the island's defense in case of an 
attack from the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	China views Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's advocacy of ``state  
to state'' relations as a move toward Taiwanese independence -- and 
has made it clear it would not rule out force to keep Taiwan in 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	Such statements have already unleashed a torrent of pro-Taiwan  
sentiment in Congress. ``We must be very clear with Beijing. The 
United States will do what it must to defend freedom and stability 
in Asia,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in remarks reflecting 
widely held views. 
</P>
<P>
	John Steinbruner, a foreign policy analyst with the Brookings  
Institution, doesn't expect a military move by China, ``but I 
wouldn't rule it out. Every time that (China-Taiwan) situation 
appears to get out of hand, China does something largely symbolic 
to remind us they're not kidding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It seems unlikely China would try anything openly provocative  
before President Clinton's September meeting with Chinese Prime 
Minister Jiang Zemin, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, India's announcement that it was creating a nuclear  
deterrence program drew immediate criticism from the Clinton 
administration, which hopes to persuade both India and Pakistan to 
abandon their nuclear programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, they're moving in the wrong direction,'' said State  
Department spokesman James P. Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	India's statement came at a time of increased military  
skirmishes and a day after an Indian scientist disclosed that 
country can make a neutron bomb, which kills people but leaves 
buildings standing.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested for Posing as Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A 36-year-old Nebraska man who posed as NFL  
players to receive free hotel rooms, meals and limousine rides has 
been arrested after he tried his scheme one more time in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Willis Clyde Thomas was charged Tuesday with two counts of  
burglary and two counts of defrauding an innkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Thomas had been posing as Chad Fann, a San Francisco  
49er tight end, and had received complimentary hotel rooms, meals 
and limousine rides from various Las Vegas hotels and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas had been the subject of a five-month fraud investigation  
conducted by NFL security officials, who enlisted police help in 
catching the impostor. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL suspects Thomas of also using Fann's name in Reno,  
Sparks, Lake Tahoe and several other states for the past 1 1/2 years, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was arrested Tuesday after he obtained a complimentary  
room at the Fremont Hotel by posing as Jamain Stephens, a 6-foot-6, 
336-pound member of the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas is 6-foot-7 and weighs 305 pounds. Fann is 6-foot-3, 252  
pounds.

	``Thomas is huge,'' police Sgt. Sam Hilliard said. ``He's a  
mountain of a man. One of the things that he does when he gets 
these comps is he always exerts some attitude, like he really is a 
pro football player and deserves special treatment.''

	Hilliard said Fann has said he wants to prosecute Thomas.

<HEADLINE> New NFL Stadium Draws Raves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Cleveland Browns and some of their fans got their first  
chance to see the new home of the NFL's newest team. 
</P>
<P>
	As workers continued putting finishing touches on the $283  
million, 72,000-seat Cleveland Browns Stadium on Tuesday, the team 
took the field for an afternoon practice after working out in the 
morning at their training facility in Berea, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beautiful,'' linebacker Chris Spielman said. ``I can't  
believe there's this many people here for a practice. The turf is 
great and I can't wait until we can get started for real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd estimated at 25,000 watched the team run through its  
drills for two hours. They roared as the defense jogged toward the 
famed ``Dawg Pound,'' Cleveland's rabid bleacher section of 10,000 
that was replicated and remodeled in the new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The team used the day, dubbed ``Stadium Sneak Preview'' as a dry  
run for Saturday's exhibition game against Minnesota, the first NFL 
game in Cleveland since Dec. 17, 1995, just before owner Art Modell 
took his team to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Season-ticket holders were invited to the event to check out  
their new seats. Concession stands served hot dogs, burgers and 
beers. Videos were shown on the stadium's two giant scoreboards and 
a high school marching band provided prepractice entertainment as 
if it was a football Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's gorgeous,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer said.  
``It's a monument to the city of Cleveland for what they've done, 
how they built the stadium and how they brought their team back.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *Titans    	
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Kenny Holmes will be out at least 10 days after  
undergoing arthroscopic surgery to repair a flap of cartilage in 
his left knee. Holmes played in Tennessee's 22-20 exhibition loss 
to Kansas City on Sunday after missing a few practices with the 
sore knee. The knee stiffened up Monday, and coach Jeff Fisher said 
they decided to fix the problem now rather than wait. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Colts    	
</P>
<P>
	Running back Vaughn Hebron, a member of Denver's Super Bowl  
champion teams the past two years, signed with Indianapolis after a 
morning workout, and was returning kicks during afternoon practice. 
</P>
<P>
	In six seasons, Hebron averaged 24.1 yards on 158 kickoffs and  
4.2 yards on 273 carries as well as catching 41 passes for 303 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Hebron was the backup to NFL MVP Terrell Davis last season. He  
had only 58 carries for 253 yards the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Packers    	
</P>
<P>
	Tight end Mark Chmura will miss the next two weeks while resting  
a bulging disc in his neck, but coach Ray Rhodes cautioned against 
reading too much into the Pro Bowl selection's condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to let that thing cool down,'' Rhodes said.  
``We'll reassess it when the time's right. It's too early to worry 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura has been treated with traction, ultrasound and massage.  
He has experienced periodic numbness in his upper body after 
contact drills. 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura watched practice from the sidelines Tuesday and will  
continue to do so. Both he and Rhodes expect him to be ready for 
the Sept. 12 season opener against Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Lions    	
</P>
<P>
	Rookie defensive end Jared DeVries, who injured his foot early  
in camp, is expected to be fitted for a cast. It is not known when 
he will return. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to put a cast on him for a full week and see what  
happens,'' coach Bobby Ross said. ``(If it doesn't get better), 
we'll have another step to take. I don't know what that step will 
be. We'll have to wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	Halfback Gary Brown, who underwent surgery shortly after  
training camp opened to have a painful hematoma drained from his 
buttocks, hopes to practice early next week for the first time. He 
hurt it in a motorcycle accident over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants' leading rusher with 1,063 yards last season, Brown  
has been limited to running in camp. Doctors have been afraid 
contact would cause the hematoma to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting itchy now,'' said Brown, who no longer has pain.  
``It's getting close. I'm like a caged dog who hasn't eaten in a 
year. I want to eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            *Cardinals    	
</P>
<P>
	The condition of offensive lineman Ernest Dye was upgraded to  
serious from critical after extensive surgery to repair his right 
arm produced a pulse. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye, defensive end Carl Simpson and offensive guard Lester  
Holmes were injured Monday when their car overturned as they were 
driving to a team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ernest's situation is day to day, then week to week,'' said  
Dr. Jerry Mohr, one of the surgeon's who operated on Dye for more 
than eight hours Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't known how long Dye will have to remain in the hospital.  
</P>
<P>
	Simpson was checked for pain in his hip and released. Holmes  
received a severe cut to the forehead and was released from the 
hospital on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Eagles    	
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia waived placekicker Chris Boniol and signed Norm  
Johnson to a two-year deal. Johnson, 39, is entering his 18th NFL 
season after a four-year stint with Pittsburgh. He ranks sixth on 
the NFL's career scoring list with 1,657 points. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Seahawks    	
</P>
<P>
	Starting tight end Christian Fauria will be sidelined for up to  
three weeks because of torn cartilage in his right knee, coach Mike 
Holmgren said. Fauria, who hurt the knee in Saturday's exhibition 
loss to Buffalo, is to undergo arthroscopic surgery on Wednesday. 
Itula Mili will start in Fauria's absence, with Deems May backing 
him up.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Tries To Recover Noxious Weed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- State and federal agriculture officials are  
scrambling to recover a noxious weed banned by the government that 
may have found its way to 35 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Home Depot received the weed in a shipment of exotic reeds from  
Holland and sold it as a pond plant. Agriculture inspectors have 
recovered many plants from gardeners but fear they can't trace them 
all. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping to get as many of them out of circulation as  
possible,'' said Randy Westbrooks, coordinator of the U.S. 
Agriculture Department's noxious weed program. ``Chances are most 
of them will die, but some will live and we will have another 
invasive species.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Known as the bur reed, or Sparganium erectum, the weed can choke  
waterways and interfere with recreation in shallow waters without 
its natural predators. The 6-foot-long, green reed has a small 
yellow flower that contains a bur-like fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal plant inspectors inadvertently allowed about 4,200 bur  
reed plants into the country in the shipment from Holland in May, 
Westbrooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant was not known to exist in the United States before the  
shipment arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	A note was attached to the container stating it was a  
pre-cleared shipment, Westbrooks said. Under an agreement, the U.S. 
and Holland certify some shipments to each other's country do not 
contain plants that are contaminated or banned. 
</P>
<P>
	Westbrooks said the noxious weed was identified near the bottom  
of the shipping papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can say our folks on this side were kind of lulled into  
this. They didn't look at all the paperwork,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors plan to scrutinize imported plants more closely and  
have asked the Netherlands to stop any further shipments of the 
unwanted weed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Shields, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Home Depot, said  
the home improvement chain was cooperating with inspectors to 
recover the plants. 
</P>
<P>
	David Reeves, the Agriculture Department official who issued the  
alert, estimated that the plants have reached 35 states. No list 
was available.

<HEADLINE> Sonia Gandhi Runs for Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Fearing possible defeat in the  
constituency represented by her assassinated husband, Sonia Gandhi 
announced today she will run for a safe seat in Parliament -- one 
her party has never lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi, 52, flew by helicopter to file her nomination  
papers in Bellary, a district in the southern state of Karnataka, 
900 miles south of New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
	The district is known for limestone quarries, mining of  
semiprecious stones, and electing Congress Party candidates to 
parliament since India's first elections in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of her party have indicated Mrs. Gandhi may also seek  
election from Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, once represented by her 
husband, Rajiv, and his brother, Sanjay. 
</P>
<P>
	In India, candidates are allowed to run in up to 10 districts.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bharatiya Janata Party, which controls the caretaker  
government, won Amethi in the 1998 election, defeating Mrs. 
Gandhi's hand-picked nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi resisted years of urging by political leaders to  
take over the Congress Party after her husband was killed in 1991. 
Last year, she changed her mind and jumped into politics to lead 
the party when it was at a low ebb. Congress has controlled India's 
governments for most of the 52 years since independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I am in politics now and I shall remain in politics,''  
she said in an interview taped for broadcast Friday on the private 
Star Plus television channel. She said her daughter, Priyanka, and 
son, Rahul, ``are extremely interested in politics,'' but are 
apparently not interested in being candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	As the staggered fall elections draw near, her Italian birth,  
political inexperience and the strength of Prime Minister Atal 
Bihari Vajpayee appear to be weighing heavily against Mrs. Gandhi. 
Her illustrious name, image as the dutiful daughter-in-law to 
former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and later grieving widow, 
appear to be of little help. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked who would make the best prime minister, 50 percent of  
respondents chose Vajpayee and just 26 percent selected Mrs. Gandhi 
in a poll of 20,640 voters published Monday in the news magazine 
India Today. The poll had a margin of error of 2 to 3 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	After a strong start, Mrs. Gandhi's campaign has steadily  
weakened. She is still her party's lead campaigner, but is no 
longer projecting herself as India's next prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi portrays Congress as the only national party that  
can unite a country in which religious and separatist movements 
have spread conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	But she has resisted building a large multiparty coalition.  
Congress has only two alliance partners while the Hindu 
nationalist-led governing coalition headed by Vajpayee has 19. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bellary, Mrs. Gandhi will face a tough opponent, Sushma  
Swaraj, a former information minister under Vajpayee and the most 
prominent woman politician in the Bharatiya Janata Party.

<HEADLINE> Jets Sign Veteran Wide Receiver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Quinn Early knew that he'd come home  
again. He just didn't know when. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran wide receiver, who as a youngster recalls watching  
Jets quarterback Joe Namath at training camp, was signed by the 
club Tuesday to battle for the fourth wide receiver slot. The 
12th-year player is graduate of Great Neck South High on Long 
Island, about 10 miles from the Jets' base at Hofstra University. 
</P>
<P>
	Early was first at Jets' camp in 1988.  
</P>
<P>
	``I came out here before the draft and worked out for the  
Jets,'' Early said. ``As a free agent, I've been out here about 
three or four times throughout my career, I just never signed. I 
think I was destined at some point to sign with the Jets. I'm glad 
it's now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Early, who played for the Buffalo Bills the past  
two seasons, immediately strengthens a receiving corps that 
includes starters Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet and emerging 
backup Dedric Ward. The need to seek out Early intensified over the 
weekend when fourth-receiver hopeful Chris Brazzell damaged knee 
ligaments in the preseason opener at Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of those guys that I think knows how to play,'' Jets  
coach Bill Parcells said of the 6-foot, 190-pound Early. ``I'm not 
asking him to come in here and be a starter at this moment, but I'm 
trying to prepare him for that eventuality in case something 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early, was a third-round draft selection of the San Diego  
Chargers in 1988, staying there three seasons. In 1990, he began a 
five-year stint with the New Orleans Saints before joining the 
Bills before the '96 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Jets quarterbacks coach Dan Henning directed Early as Chargers  
head coach in 1989 and '90 and as Bills offensive coordinator in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan Henning, who has experience with Quinn, told me that he  
can learn any wide receiver position -- quickly,'' Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
	Early 119 starts in 163 career games, compiling 454 receptions  
for 6,365 yards and 40 touchdowns. Two seasons ago at Buffalo, he 
enjoyed the third-best receiving total of his career with 60 
catches for 853 yards and 5 TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he caught only 19 balls for 217 yards, including  
eight receptions against the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever my role is, I'm just going to try to do my best to  
help the team in the situations that the team is put in,'' Early 
said. ``I'm going to give them the help I can, and if the 
opportunity materializes, I'm going to make the best of my 
opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells called Early three months ago at his home in San Diego,  
then again last week before finalizing a one-year deal for 
undisclosed terms late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is definitely the place to be,'' Early said. ``I've never  
gotten even close to getting to the Super Bowl or anything like 
that. This team has a great opportunity here and I'm just glad to 
be a part of that.''

<HEADLINE> Child Abuse Conviction Reinstated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The state's highest court Wednesday once again  
reinstated the conviction of a former day-care center operator 
accused in one of the most lurid mass child-molestation cases of 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means Cheryl Amirault LeFave, who has served eight  
years behind bars but has been free since 1995, will probably be 
sent back to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	A lower court had granted Ms. LeFave a new trial last year in  
light of new research that showed prosecutors' suggestive interview 
techniques made it impossible to tell if her young accusers were 
telling the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Supreme Judicial Court ruled Wednesday that those issues  
had been properly dealt with at Ms. LeFave's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. LeFave reasserted her innocence after the ruling and said  
she will keep trying to clear her name. Her attorney said he likely 
will ask the governor to pardon her and her brother, who was also 
convicted in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will continue to fight from behind the wall,'' Ms. LeFave  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. LeFave, Gerald Amirault and their mother, Violet Amirault,  
were convicted of sexually assaulting young children at their 
center in Malden, the Fells Acres Day School. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said there were about 40 victims between the ages of  
2 and 4. Children testified that they had been tied to trees, 
sexually penetrated with knives and tortured by a ``bad clown'' in 
a ``secret room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the women were released after serving eight years of an  
eight- to 20-year prison sentence, when a judge overturned their 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ruled the women had been improperly denied their right  
to literally confront their accusers, because the children 
testified with their backs to the defendants. Prosecutors appealed, 
and in March 1997, the Supreme Judicial Court reinstated the 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother died in 1997, while the brother, who was convicted in  
a separate trial in 1986, remains in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Then last year, a judge again ordered a new trial for Ms. LeFave  
and said there should be no testimony -- old or new -- from the 
accusers, now in their late teens. Prosecutors appealed, and the 
Supreme Judicial Court on Wednesday ruled in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defendant presented evidence at her trial tending to show  
that the child witnesses' testimony was unreliable as a result of 
improper interviewing techniques,'' the justices wrote. ``The jury 
nevertheless believed the child witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Martha Coakley said she will seek to have Ms.  
LeFave sent back to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's decision vindicates all of the children who testified  
to devastating abuses suffered at the Fells Acres Day School,'' Ms. 
Coakley said. ``It is our hope that those victims will now be able 
to put their terrible ordeal behind them.''

<HEADLINE> UFW Loses Large Strawberry Grower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- An upstart union defeated the United Farm  
Workers in a final count of votes determining who would represent 
workers at the nation's largest strawberry grower. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Agricultural Labor Relations Board on Tuesday tallied  
725 votes for the Coastal Berry of California Farm Workers 
Committee, compared to 616 for the UFW, Coastal Berry Co. President 
Ernie Farley said in a statement. There were 19 unresolved ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy the election is over and we look forward to a long  
and prosperous relationship with a certified union representing our 
work force,'' Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were long considered a foregone conclusion, but the  
final count was delayed as labor officials tried to determine the 
validity of ballots cast in a runoff election in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The UFW had been trying to unionize Oxnard-based Coastal Berry  
for several years in hopes of building momentum for union contracts 
throughout the state's $600 million, 20,000-worker strawberry 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Representation was seen as key to the future of the UFW. The  
union's membership has increased from about 20,000 in 1993 to about 
27,500 now, according to UFW spokesman Mark Grossman. 
</P>
<P>
	The UFW said it plans to pursue objections to the election it  
filed to the Agricultural Labor Relations Board. ``This election 
cannot be certified and no party can claim victory until those 
objections are resolved,'' the group said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of the outcome, the UFW will not be deterred by  
industry thugs fronting for strawberry growers from continuing to 
organize farm workers in strawberries and other crops,'' the group 
said.

	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Some of the biggest doping scandals in the  
history of track and field: 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Johnson, Canada, sprinter -- Johnson was stripped of his  
Olympic gold medal and 100-meter world record after testing 
positive for steroids at the 1988 Seoul Games. After serving a 
two-year suspension, he later received a lifetime ban for testing 
positive for high levels of testosterone in 1993. Last month, the 
International Amateur Athletic Federation rejected his petition for 
reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Slaney, United States, long distance runner -- The 1983  
world champion in the 1,500 and 3,000 meters was given a two-year 
retroactive ban after testing positive for abnormally levels of T-E 
(testosterone-epitestosterone) at the 1996 Olympic trials. Slaney 
claimed the high levels were due to birth control pills she was 
taking. She has repeatedly proclaimed her innocence and is still 
fighting the charges. Slaney has filed lawsuits against the IAAF 
and the U.S. Olympic Committee, which administered the original 
test.

	Katrin Krabbe, Germany, sprinter -- Krabbe, the 100-meter and  
200-meter champion at the 1991 World Championships at Tokyo, 
received a one-year ban in 1992 after she admitted taking the 
banned substance clenbuterol in an asthma medicine. Krabbe 
maintained she was unaware it was on the list of banned drugs. 
Three years ago, a German court ruled the German federation's one 
year ban was appropriate but that the IAAF had no right to extend 
Krabbe's suspension beyond the one year. 
</P>
<P>
	Butch Reynolds, United States, sprinter -- Reynolds, who set the  
world record in the 400 meters in 1988, received a two-year ban 
after a positive steroid test in 1990. USA Track and Field later 
exonerated Reynolds, but the IAAF refused to budge. Reynolds won a 
$27 million civil judgment against the IAAF, only to see it 
overturned, and the IAAF extend his suspension through Jan. 1, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Mitchell, United States, sprinter -- Mitchell, the  
100-meter bronze medalist in the 1992 Olympics and two-time world 
championship bronze medalist, was handed a two-year suspension from 
competition after testing positive for high levels of testosterone. 
Mitchell will be ineligible from April 1, 1998, until March 31, 
2000. USA Track and Field cleared Mitchell in December, but the 
IAAF last month overturned the ruling and banned him for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Linford Christie, Britain, sprinter -- The 1992 Barcelona Olympic  
100-meter champion and 1993 world champion tested positive for 
Nandrolone following an indoor meet in Dortmund, Germany, in 
February. The 39-year-old denies he used the banned substance, 
claiming there was no point since he has effectively retired from 
top competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Javier Sotomayor, Cuba, high jumper -- The world indoor and  
outdoor record-holder and the only high jumper to clear 8 feet (2.4 
meters), Sotomayor was stripped of his gold medal at the Pan 
American Games two weeks ago after testing positive for cocaine. 
Sotomayor denies taking the substance and insists something he 
ingested must have been contaminated. He faces a possible two-year 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Merlene Ottey, Jamaica, sprinter -- The veteran sprinter with the  
most medals (14) in the history of the world championships, 
withdrew Wednesday from the upcoming edition in Seville after her 
``A'' sample turned up positive for Nandrolone from a test last 
month in Lucerne, Switzerland. The ``B'' sample is yet to be 
tested.

<HEADLINE> Elliott Continues To Recuperate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A brother of Spurs forward Sean Elliott said  
Wednesday he had no hesitation about donating a kidney for 
Elliott's transplant and urged others to become organ donors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that I would have done for either one of my  
brothers. Fortunately for Sean and myself, I was a good match,'' 
said Noel Elliott, 32. His kidney was removed in surgery Monday 
then immediately used in his brother's transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Elliott, 31, a 10-year NBA veteran who helped lead San  
Antonio to its first NBA championship in June, continues to 
recuperate at Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	His blood pressure is good, he is becoming more active and he  
has been taken off of intravenous fluids, said transplant surgeon 
Dr. Francis Wright. Elliott is expected to hospitalized about a 
week. His brother could be released later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, it continues to be good news all around for both of  
them,'' Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Elliott needed the transplant because of a disease called  
focal segmental glomerular sclerosis that prevents his kidneys from 
properly filtering waste from the blood. It is not known what 
causes the illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott has not spoken publicly since the surgery. Through  
spokesman Armando Rios, Elliott issued a statement Wednesday 
calling Noel's kidney ``a gift of love and life'' and thanking 
well-wishers for their support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there will be difficult days ahead. Knowing that I have  
your continued prayers and support, I'm sure it will go well,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott has indicated he wants to return to the NBA after the  
transplant. Doctors have said it could be two or three months 
before they know the feasibility of his making a return to the 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, Odiemae Elliott of Tuscon, Ariz., also thanked the  
public for prayers, phone calls and messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a step for Sean,'' she said. ``It's his first  
step toward recovery. Noel will be well. Sean has a lifelong 
journey to make, and if you would continue your support and prayer, 
that would be helpful to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Elliott said she was glad both of Sean's brothers offered to  
provide a kidney. Noel was determined to be an appropriate match. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is actually every mother's dream and every mother's  
nightmare, because you want your children to love enough to be 
willing to do that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But then by the same token ... I had my two sons in the  
operating room at one time. I think fathers could even understand 
this. It was scary. It was scary,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Noel Elliott, a sales associate for Wal-Mart in Arizona, joked  
that the kidney donation had made him ``kind of an instant 
celebrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the worst parts of the ordeal was the blood testing done  
before the surgery to determine donor eligibility, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They draw a lot of blood. But you just do what you have to  
do,'' Noel Elliott said, adding with a laugh that he told Sean, ``I 
was going to have to have tickets to the Spurs games -- and a book 
deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noel Elliott urged others to become organ donors.  
</P>
<P>
	``I do want to encourage anyone that's on the line, on the edge  
of being a donor or not, to seriously consider donating an organ or 
bone marrow,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Sean have seen each other several times since the  
transplant, ``slowly creeping back and forth from room to room,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The exchanges are just, I would call them, normal brotherly  
love kind of exchanges. He's thanked me repeatedly. I think we just 
feel just a deep commitment to each other,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bank Error Nets Man Surprise Fortune </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- Roger Dudley made the most of the $1.6  
million that showed up in his checking account: He invested, bought 
gifts for his wife, and paid off his truck and credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he may face federal charges.  
</P>
<P>
	The Secret Service and federal prosecutors are reviewing the  
case. Officials at AmSouth Bank said no charges had been filed as 
of Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley, 21, told WAAY-TV he discovered the extra money in his  
AmSouth account when he asked for his balance about two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a dream and a nightmare at the same time,'' he said.  
``Reality didn't set in for a couple of days. It mixes you up 
bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley kept most of the money in the bank. But he still spent  
plenty, buying 7,000 shares of AmSouth mutual funds and an airplane 
ticket and earrings for his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	The fortune vanished almost as quickly as it appeared: Federal  
agents met Dudley at the bank on Monday, and the account was 
frozen. 
</P>
<P>
	AmSouth Bank spokesman Jim Underwood said the mistake apparently  
resulted from a printing error when another customer ordered new 
deposit slips. Underwood did not identify the customer whose money 
went into Dudley's account, but WAAY reported it was a hospital in 
Mobile. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood said customers must notify the bank if extra money  
shows up in an account. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nice while it lasted,'' Dudley said. ``Someday I'll  
say, `I remember when I was a millionaire.'''

<HEADLINE> Ali Sues To Get Rights to His Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Lawyers for Muhammad Ali have filed a  
lawsuit claiming a one-time personal lawyer of Ali and an associate 
duped the former heavyweight boxing champion into signing away the 
rights to his life story. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed last Friday in U.S. District Court, accused  
Richard Hirschfeld, a longtime friend as well as lawyer of Ali, of 
taking advantage of Ali's weak condition while he was being treated 
for Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali asked the court to declare his 1988 business agreement with  
Hirschfeld and the associate, Ali's former manager and spiritual 
adviser, Jabir Herbert Muhammad of Chicago, null and void. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Pictures has announced plans, with Ali's cooperation,  
to make a movie about Ali, who will be portrayed by Will Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Ali's lawsuit, he was never paid anything for  
signing the contract giving 40 percent interest in his life story 
to Hirschfeld and Muhammad. The contract created a Virginia company 
called Muhammad Ali Productions Inc., with Ali, Hirschfeld and 
Muhammad as directors. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court papers, the company owns exclusive rights to  
any autobiography or authorized biography of Ali's life, including 
books, TV shows and movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Cooter, a Washington lawyer for Muhammad Ali Productions,  
said Wednesday that Ali got a fair deal when he signed the contract 
and was not misled. ``Muhammad Ali entered into a business 
transaction, and he knew exactly what he was doing,'' Cooter said. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Muhammad Ali Productions filed a lawsuit in federal  
court in Roanoke, Va., to block the Columbia Pictures movie. The 
lawsuit sought $50 million from Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., 
parent company of Columbia Pictures. The suit was dropped in June, 
and Cooter wouldn't say whether the case would be refiled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're weighing all of our options,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hirschfeld, who spent four years in prison for a 1991 tax and  
securities fraud conviction, fled the country in 1996 after being 
indicted on additional fraud charges. Cooter declined comment on 
Hirschfeld's whereabouts.

<HEADLINE> Old Stadium Finds New Life As Reef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The old Cleveland Municipal Stadium is still  
attracting scores of visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Only this time, they aren't sports fans -- they're fish.  
</P>
<P>
	A joint project by Ohio Sea Grant and the city of Cleveland has  
turned rubble from the old stadium into an artificial underwater 
reef, teeming with life and a boost to both fishing and diving. 
</P>
<P>
	The reefs are the latest additions to a program designed to  
provide gathering points for fish in the relatively featureless 
central Lake Erie basin, said Dave Kelch, an Ohio Sea Grant agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Three reefs were built out of concrete from the old stadium,  
which was demolished so the home of the new Cleveland Browns' could 
be built on the same spot. That stadium will open Saturday when the 
Browns play the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reefs are known, marked, close to shore, safe, and there's  
lots of fish,'' Kelch said. ``Our studies have shown they 
concentrate 20 to 60 times the amount of fish than are in non-reef 
areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three stadium reefs sit on the lake bottom anywhere from 32  
to 36 feet underwater, rising to about 20 feet below the water 
surface. They're easily accessible by small boat -- about 
three-quarters of a mile offshore -- and have a combined length of 
over 1,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The new habitat for fish and other marine life means spectacular  
views for divers and some pretty good fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	On one recent afternoon, fishermen hauled in two 14-inch-long  
smallmouth bass within minutes of casting their lines into the 
water over the Edgewater Park reef. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this spot two years ago, you might have sat here all day  
and you wouldn't catch anything,'' said Andy Emrisko, a boat 
captain and fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
	A dive team explores the reef areas once a month, checking lake  
temperatures, taking pictures and videotaping underwater. Kelch 
said the latest diving expedition uncovered just what he was hoping 
for -- an abundance of marine life. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to their recreational uses, the reefs also have  
research potential. Kelch and several volunteer anglers tag and 
record the smallmouth bass they throw back into the water, as part 
of an ongoing project to track movement of the fish and to study 
survival rates for fish that are caught and released. 
</P>
<P>
	Walleye, bass and yellow perch congregate around the reef,  
although they spawn elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio Sea Grant's reef project, begun in 1984, was already  
underway when it was announced that the Great Depression-era 
Municipal Stadium would come down. When Kelch heard about the 
demolition, he approached the city with a proposal to make use of 
the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old stadium was ``perfect,'' Kelch said.  
</P>
<P>
	The stadium reefs were constructed offshore of Cleveland in late  
1997. About 15,000 tons of rubble -- free of oil, paint, asbestos 
and other contaminants -- was broken into pieces, loaded onto a 
barge, transported to the current reef sites and dumped into the 
lake.

<HEADLINE> Who Is This FICA Guy? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It has been an eventful few weeks in NFL training camps.  
</P>
<P>
	But then it usually is.  
</P>
<P>
	No rookies got beat up with a bag of coins, as happened during  
hazing last summer in New Orleans Saints camp. And no one got cut 
with a pair of scissors waiting for a haircut, as happened last 
summer in the fun-loving Dallas camp. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were enough holdouts, hijinks and Boys Town  
reclamation projects to keep the cops and coaches busy. One guy 
even disappeared on religious grounds. And as a just-completed 
survey of the top draft picks of 1998-99 makes only too clear, 
chances are slim things will change anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to hope that the kids have gotten smarter since the  
days when I played,'' said agent Ralph Cindrich, who commissioned 
the survey. ``But I still think they take way too much for 
granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young men, sudden fame and fortune, and a livelihood that  
rewards reckless behavior made for a volatile mix long before 
Cindrich was a tough-guy linebacker with Houston and New England 
from 1972-75. It still does -- even though the NFL runs its rookies 
through a very thorough orientation program and offers counseling 
on a need basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Anybody who doubts how volatile could drop in on any camp almost  
any day of the week. The most eventful stop this week was in Miami, 
where Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson claimed Dimitrius Underwood off 
waivers Monday, hoping to persuade the former Vikings' first-round 
pick that there was room in his life for both religion and 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood went AWOL from the Vikings after just one practice,  
saying he wanted to pursue the ministry. One thing Johnson can 
offer is a chance to minister to some very troubled young men; the 
Dolphins' training camp roster includes three convicted felons and 
receiver Tony Martin, currently on trial on federal charges of 
laundering drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindrich knows only too well how some of those ballplayers got  
into trouble. ``They get exposed to a world they have very little 
experience in, or preparation for. They get pulled along too 
fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His first attempt to gauge what the kids coming into the league  
knew -- or thought they knew -- about finances, injuries, drugs and 
the like came in 1992. Cindrich hired an independent research firm 
to complete 100 surveys from among the 400 top-rated draft picks. 
This time, his survey sample was nearly twice as big, and the 
questions more refined. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news is the kids appear to be a little more savvy about  
money and AIDS, and they hold enlightened positions on racial 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad news is they are more desperate to make money. Nearly  
one in 10 would risk his health for pay. That same number claimed 
to know a college football player who bet against his team in a 
game he played in. 
</P>
<P>
	And while 99 percent said athletes who commit violent acts  
against coaches, teammates or officials should be fined or 
suspended, the number fell to just over half (54 percent) when 
players were involved in domestic violence incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	What Cindrich found most depressing finding was the threefold  
increase -- from 3 percent to 9 percent -- in the number of players 
who would use steroids to become a first-round draft choice of 
All-Pro, even if it reduced their life expectancy by five years. 
But recklessness is clearly part of the bargain. One-third of the 
respondents reported being knocked out by a concussion, and 
one-fifth had experienced temporary amnesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Short-term thinking bothered Cindrich enough to undertake the  
survey in the first place. He found himself feeling bad at NFL 
alumni functions watching former buddies struggle up and down a 
small set of stairs because of crippling injuries. And he found 
himself feeling worse when players who squandered what money they 
made during brief careers tried to hit him up for a loan. 
</P>
<P>
	There should be a little less of that in the future. Players  
have an increasingly realistic notion of what they'll be paid. 
Unfortunately, half still don't know they're likely to wind up in a 
39 percent tax bracket. Five percent of the ballplayers thought 
they would pay no taxes at all -- a marked improvement from the 24 
percent who thought that six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first call is always about taxes,'' Cindrich said. ``So  
few of these guys have had even after-school jobs that they see 
their first paycheck and demand to know where the rest of the money 
went. The calls were so frequent I used to have a lady in the 
office, a very motherly type, whose specialty was handling those 
guys. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a while,'' he said, ``I didn't have the patience.''  
</P>
<P>
	Imagine how Cindrich would have felt if Nick Kypreos was one of  
his clients. After the New York Rangers won the Stanley Cup, they 
were invited to the White House and Kypreos, a forward, became a 
man on a mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to find out who this FICA guy is,'' Kypreos said, ``and  
how come he's taking so much of my money.''

recalled: ``We just kept staring at each other. It literally must 
have been about 30 seconds, which was like the longest time -- like, 
Normandy wasn't that long. And I remember the whole time in my mind 
going, `I have the next line. I hold the cards. Let me show them 
how NOT afraid of Tom Cruise I am.''' Mohr plays an unscrupulous 
movie producer in the half-hour sitcom ``Action,'' which debuts 
Sept. 16 on the Fox network.

<HEADLINE> Teammates Remember Pee Wee Reese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Brooklyn Dodger teammates attending Pee  
Wee Reese's funeral Wednesday remembered the Hall of Fame shortstop 
as a man among the Boys of Summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the tradition, he was the greatest Dodger of them  
all,'' center fielder Duke Snider said. 
</P>
<P>
	Snider recalled a trip to Hawaii with Reese and Don Zimmer to  
attend the baseball winter meetings. ``They had a big chair there 
that was called the `Kahuna chair,' '' he said. ``Zimmer said to 
him, `Captain, that's your chair.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2,000 people attended Reese's funeral at Southeast  
Christian Church. The eight-time All-Star, who played on seven 
pennant winners and one World Series champion in Brooklyn, died 
Saturday at age 81 after a two-year fight with lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the mourners were nearly all the surviving regulars from  
the Brooklyn glory years of the 1940s and '50s: Snider; Zimmer (who 
took a temporary leave from his post as bench coach of the New York 
Yankees); Joe Black; Don Newcombe; Carl Erskine; Ralph Branca; 
Clyde King -- even the deeply private Sandy Koufax. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a teammate for four years, a friend for 40,'' Koufax  
said. ``What is there to say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rachel Robinson, widow of Jackie Robinson, said Reese's  
leadership helped hold the Dodgers together in 1947, the year her 
husband broke major league baseball's color barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	A Kentucky native, Reese first refused to sign a petition that  
threatened a boycott if Robinson joined the team. Then, as Robinson 
was being heckled by fans in Cincinnati during the Dodgers' first 
road trip, Reese went over to him and put his arm around Robinson's 
shoulder in a gesture of inclusion and support. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in New York, Mrs. Robinson heard what Reese had done.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a very supportive gesture, and very  
instinctive on Pee Wee's part,'' she said. ``You shouldn't forget 
that Pee Wee was the captain, and he led the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Think of the guts that took,'' said Erskine, a pitcher on that  
team. ``Pee Wee had to go home (to segregated Louisville) and 
answer to his friends. ... I told Jackie later that (Reese's 
gesture) helped my race more than his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Southeast minister Bob Russell eulogized Reese, who followed his  
playing career with one in broadcasting, in a 45-minute service 
which included video clips and a rendition of ``Amazing Grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been a lot of great baseball players, a lot of  
well-known announcers,'' Russell said. ``Pee Wee Reese is more 
remembered for being a good man, a gentleman, a leader, a 
competitor, a courageous person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell noted that ``Teammates,'' a book about Reese and  
Robinson and the friendship that grew between them, is now used to 
teach racial tolerance in some elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley, whose father moved the team  
from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, was impressed as a teen-ager by the 
esteem in which Reese's Boys of Summer teammates held their 
captain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pee Wee had something, today you'd call it people skills,''  
O'Malley said. ``He knew how to communicate. I think he would have 
been an extraordinary manager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Green Bay Packers running back Paul Hornung, also a  
resident of Louisville, remembered golfing with Reese and traveling 
with him to sign autographs at sports shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really something special when we went to New York,'' he  
said. ``His lines were as long as (Joe) DiMaggio's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of love and admiration had as much to do with Reese's  
personality as with his sparkling play in the field, Snider said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not all that analytical to be able to put into words what  
it was,'' he said. ``Whenever anyone needed any help, you went to 
Pee Wee, or he went to them. He was very concerned about each 
individual on the ball club and their happiness. Whenever anyone 
was having family problems, or in a slump, he'd help them out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the way he handled himself.''

<HEADLINE> Dell Stock Surges on Earnings Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp.'s shares surged today  
following a report of a 47 percent increase in second-quarter 
profits that was helped by a 67 percent increase in sales to small 
businesses and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell, the largest seller of computers directly to customers,  
said it earned $507 million, or 19 cents per share, in the quarter 
that ended July 30. That was up from a profit of $346 million, or 
12 cents a share in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 42 percent to $6.14 billion from $4.33 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The profit beat the 17 cents per share expected by financial  
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. The results were 
released after the close of financial markets Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell stock was up 8.1 percent, or by $3.13 1/4, at $44.43 3/4 a share  
this afternoon in heavy trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell's upbeat results were in sharp contrast to archrival Compaq  
Computer Corp., which posted a $184 million quarterly loss last 
month as it lost sales to Dell. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell's growth in the home user market probably has affected  
several competitors, particularly Hewlett-Packard Co. and Compaq, 
which depend on retail sales, said Lou Mazzucchelli, senior vice 
president of the New York investment house Gerard Klauer Mattison. 
</P>
<P>
	``The direct (sales) model is steadily encroaching on the retail  
market,'' Mazzucchelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway Inc., another direct seller of PCs, probably also has  
been affected but not as deeply, he said. Gateway Inc. recently 
reported a 47 percent increase in second quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, has set a scorching industry  
pace with its unconventional tactic of selling machines directly to 
customers and cutting out the retailers and distributors who can 
drive up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's overseas sales also continued to grow. Dell said  
it now ranks first in PC shipments within the United Kingdom and 
that revenue in France increased 55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far it looks like their business model continues to work  
for them,'' said Mazzucchelli. ``They are blessed with overall good 
demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the six months that ended July 30, Dell said it earned $941  
million, or 34 cents a share. That was up from a profit of $650 
million, or 23 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 
to $11.68 billion from $8.25 billion.

<HEADLINE> Gun Shots Killed Ex-NFL Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Former NFL player Demetrius DuBose was shot 11  
times by police, mostly in the back and stomach, when they say he 
fought them during an arrest attempt last month, according to an 
autopsy report released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose, 28, also had traces of Ecstasy, cocaine and alcohol in  
his blood when he was killed in his Mission Beach neighborhood 
where police say he burglarized a home. 
</P>
<P>
	The blood tests revealed only a trace of alcohol -- about the  
equivalent of one beer -- but there was a significant amount of 
cocaine, a stimulant, and Ecstasy, a methametamphine-type drug that 
can cause hallucinations, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had likely ingested cocaine a few hours before the shooting  
and the (Ecstasy) up to a day earlier,'' said Dwight Reed, forensic 
toxicology manager for the San Diego County Medical Examiner's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he could only guess at the effect the combination had on  
DuBose's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know anything about his tolerance level,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	DuBose's family hired their own investigators and another  
autopsy after police initially refused to release details of his 
death. They believe excessive force was used because DuBose was 
black. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Watkins, a San Diego lawyer hired by the DuBose family,  
disputed the analysis of the drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report doesn't say he was under the influence of drugs,''  
Watkins said. ``Regardless, nothing justified him being shot 
multiple times in the back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose's roommate, Randy West, has said DuBose slipped onto a  
neighbor's balcony for a better view of the sunset and fell asleep 
on a bed, which ``doesn't indicate someone who was whacked out, 
foaming at the mouth under the influence of cocaine,'' Watkins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And Ecstasy is the touchy-feely love drug,'' Watkins said,  
noting that DuBose was a recreational drug user, not an addict. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the tenants found DuBose, asked him to leave and called  
police, which had already received two burglary reports for the 
neighborhood, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	While West and DuBose were trying to resolve the situation with  
the neighbor, police arrived. After questioning the men, police 
tried to arrest DuBose. When he refused, police tried to spray him 
with Mace, but DuBose ran down an alley. They caught him, scuffled 
and he got away again. 
</P>
<P>
	When they caught him a second time, they struggled with him. He  
somehow managed to get the officers' nunchakas, a martial arts 
weapon that consists of two wooden sticks joined at the ends by a 
short chain or rope. That's when the officers fired. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose was shot 11 times with 9-millimeter guns, many of the  
copper-jackets bullets ricocheting throughout rather exiting his 
body, the autopsy showed. 
</P>
<P>
	He was shot five times in the chest and six times in the back.  
The report didn't specify which shot was fired first, although 
eight were labeled fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	The autopsy report, usually a public record, was sealed while  
the San Diego Police Department conducted an internal investigation 
into the July 24 shooting, said Lloyd Amborn, a spokesman for the 
San Diego County Medical Examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Amborn said the office decided to make the document public after  
police investigators Tuesday submitted their report to the district 
attorney, which investigates all police shootings resulting in 
injury or death. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Paul Pfingst will decide within the next few  
weeks whether criminal charges are warranted against the officers, 
spokeswoman Gayle Falkenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The district attorney's findings don't cover personnel or  
disciplinary action,'' she said, noting the recent police shooting 
in Riverside County in which prosecutors found no criminal 
wrongdoing but the four officers were fired for killing 19-year-old 
Tyisha Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``And, nothing stops a civil lawsuit from being filed by the  
family,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Watkins said he will reserve a decision until the district  
attorney concludes his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Dave Bejarano won't comment on the case until that time,  
either, police spokesman Bill Robinson said Wednesday. The officers 
are on administrative duty pending the outcome. Their names haven't 
been released. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose played for Notre Dame from 1989 to 1992, and was a team  
captain. He was a second-round draft pick of Tampa Bay in 1993 and 
played four seasons with the team as a linebacker. He signed with 
the New York Jets in 1997, but was cut during training camp.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Official Resigns Over Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The head of the Massachusetts Port Authority  
resigned Wednesday after it was learned that he went on a ``booze 
cruise'' paid for by his agency during which a woman bared her 
breasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Blute said in a letter of resignation to Gov. Paul  
Cellucci: ``Recent errors in judgment by myself have called into 
question my ability to remain as executive director of this 
authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The authority, commonly known as Massport, oversees Logan  
International Airport and Boston Harbor and has annual revenue of 
$330 million. Blute made $120,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Photographs of the four-hour party boat cruise on Tuesday were  
published in Wednesday's Boston Herald, which said its reporters 
saw Blute and lobbyist Sandy Tennant, a top state Republican party 
official for about 20 years, drinking beer and champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men admitted later that they drank heavily during the  
afternoon cruise. Blute, a former two-term congressman, said he 
took a vacation day for the cruise. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the harbor tour, the newspaper said, a female  
passenger lifted her shirt, eliciting whoops and hollers from other 
passengers. The Herald published a photo of the woman with her 
shirt raised. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to Massport told The Associated Press that Blute  
was not on deck when the woman bared her breasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Blute said in a telephone interview that resigning was a tough  
decision, ``but I think ultimately what's important is moving the 
agenda of Massport forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennant said he was on the cruise to help Maureen Stemberg,  
divorced wife of Staples office-supply founder and Republican 
fund-raiser Thomas Stemberg, plan a fund-raiser for a cancer 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we're here is we're trying to do something good for  
a person,'' Tennant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Massport spokesman Jeremy Crockford said the authority paid $834  
for the charter with the understanding that Ms. Stemberg would 
reimburse the agency. The agency has since been reimbursed for the 
cruise. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gov. Jane M. Swift said that because of the incident, she  
and Cellucci have severed all ties with Tennant, who once headed 
the state GOP. Tennant also was barred from raising money for the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor was incredibly angry,'' Swift said.  
</P>
<P>
	Tennant's driver's license was revoked for four months after a  
May 20 drunken driving arrest, which happened shortly after he 
challenged Texas Gov. George W. Bush about his past drinking.

<HEADLINE> Profile of Social Security Pioneer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAR ISLAND, N.H. (AP) -- Old magazines, some of them dating back  
to the 1930s, are stacked along the staircase in Bob Ball's summer 
retreat on this island in Lake Winnipesaukee. But nothing about 
Ball is in retreat: He's still fighting battles he waged in the 
early days of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. 
</P>
<P>
	He is one of the pioneer builders of the Social Security system,  
and White House advisers, members of Congress and presidential 
candidates still seek him out. So he finds it useful to keep a 
cordless telephone and a fax machine in his cottage. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than half a century, the 85-year-old Ball has offered  
the same message: Social Security works. Be careful about tampering 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to more or less retire a few times and then somebody  
attacks the program,'' Ball said with mock exasperation. ``What am 
I going to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton's top economic expert, Gene  
Sperling, said Ball ``is still the type of butt-to-chair, 
pound-out-the-memos policy wonk that we look for when we're trying 
to hire people half his age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when lawmakers and many Americans question Social  
Security's viability, Ball is perhaps the most influential holdout 
against the idea -- which has caught the public imagination during 
the stock market boom -- that the program should be replaced with 
individual investment accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball's 1998 book, ``Straight Talk About Social Security,'' grew  
from memos he wrote to Clinton administration officials considering 
whether individual investment accounts should be part of a 
presidential proposal to bolster Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball advised against it, even visiting the White House to argue  
his point in a debate for Clinton's staff. Ultimately, Clinton 
dropped the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Some would-be reformers suggest Ball's influence impedes  
progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robert Ball comes from a generation that saw government as a  
solution to national problems,'' said Richard Thau, director of 
Third Millennium, a youth organization advocating individual Social 
Security stock market accounts. ``This is a dynamic, not a static 
program, and each generation has an obligation to model it 
according to its needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ball can't be dismissed as disdainful of youthful ideals.  
</P>
<P>
	He reminisces about how, fresh out of college and newly married  
in 1936, he put aside job worries in the midst of the Great 
Depression to take his bride Doris on a two-month honeymoon, 
camping in the Adirondacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple still make the run from Bear Island to the mainland  
in their own speed boat and mix mean martinis for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball sees himself as among the last defenders of a  
Depression-era inspiration that remains relevant. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security, he explains, was conceived as a way for society  
to share the cost of some universal risks -- disability, death of a 
family breadwinner and poverty in old age. In 1965, Medicare was 
added to safeguard against high-cost illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear whole discussions today about proposals to save  
Social Security as if it were just a retirement system,'' said 
Ball. ``I think of it as really our family insurance plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ball agrees that the time has come to invest Social Security's  
cash reserves in the stock market. But he insists it must be done 
through a central government account to preserve risk-pooling -- or 
not be done at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Social Security can ride out the ups and downs of the stock  
market, but it's risky for an individual investor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Governor Edward Gramlich recalls that Ball  
couldn't be budged from that stance when the two served on a Social 
Security reform commission that ended in deadlock in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get on his difficult side on an issue, he can be very  
tenacious,'' said Gramlich. ``But it never bothered me too much in 
the sense that I knew he was doing it for good reasons that he felt 
deeply about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ball has been a Social Security advocate most of his adult life.  
</P>
<P>
	At age 25, in 1939, he took a job in a New Jersey office of the  
brand new agency running Social Security. Work there included 
explaining the program to employers and helping elderly people file 
some of the first claims for benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1942, Ball moved to Social Security's headquarters in  
Baltimore to help train growing ranks of Social Security employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty years later, Ball was named Social Security commissioner  
by President Kennedy, and he stayed in the job through President 
Nixon's first term. 
</P>
<P>
	He helped President Johnson win enactment of and launch  
Medicare, a job that included overseeing the desegregation of many 
hospitals that otherwise could not have received federal dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The health facilities for blacks just clearly, like schools,  
were not equal, regardless of what was said,'' recalled Ball. ``So 
we greatly improved access to health care as well as eliminating 
race discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ball continues to lend his expertise. For most of the year, he  
and his wife live in a Washington suburb where he can be close to 
the action. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's supposed to be what he calls semi-retired,'' said Doris  
Ball, ``but nobody in the family believes it.''

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Flight Came Close to Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- An hour before it crashed, John F.  
Kennedy Jr.'s plane came close enough to an American Airlines plane 
that a radar controller alerted the crew on the jetliner, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board confirmed the incident  
but it was not clear how close the planes came to each other, The 
Providence Journal reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The planes were close enough to prompt the traffic advisory to  
the commercial plane, but there was ``no apparent risk of 
collision,'' according to NTSB spokesman Paul Schlamm. 
</P>
<P>
	Such advisories are not rare, Schlamm said. He said the incident  
was not serious enough to require a course adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's plane went down off Martha's Vineyard, Mass., on July  
16. Kennedy, his wife and his sister-in-law died. One possible 
explanation for the crash is that Kennedy was disoriented by 
nighttime haze. 
</P>
<P>
	A radar controller on New York's Long Island issued the traffic  
advisory to the American Airlines crew while the two planes were 
northwest of White Plains, N.Y., 150 miles from the crash site. The 
pilot told the radar controller that he could see the smaller plane 
from his cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's Piper Saratoga, which was heading from New Jersey to  
Massachusetts, did not receive an advisory, Schlamm said.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Airline Grounded for Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIMA, Peru (AP) - Peru's flagship carrier Aeroperu, which ceased  
flights in March saddled with $174 million in debts, was grounded 
for good Wednesday after creditors voted to liquidate its assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came two months after U.S.-based Continental  
Airlines pulled out of talks to refloat the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Aeroperu had announced the Houston-based carrier would inject  
$30 million into a restructuring plan, but Continental Airlines 
never confirmed the offer and dropped out at the last minute after 
a closed-door meeting with Peru President Alberto Fujimori. 
</P>
<P>
	Four new restructuring plans were rejected by major creditors on  
Wednesday, including an offer by minority shareholders to pump $80 
million into the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S.-based Delta and Aeromexico had each held 35 percent  
interests in Aeroperu, but dissolved their stakes in January, 
deepening Aeroperu's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Many blamed a two-year price war with national competitor  
Aerocontinente for Aeroperu's demise. But minority shareholders on 
Wednesday charged that mismanagement was the true cause.

<HEADLINE>  Boxer Fernando Vargas Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Felony assault charges were filed  
against IBF junior middleweight champion Fernando Vargas and could 
lead to a nearly eight-year prison term if he's convicted, a 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, 21, of Oxnard and four friends were charged Tuesday with  
assault with a deadly weapon and conspiracy to commit a crime 
stemming from a July 25 altercation at a Summerland home, Deputy 
District Attorney Hilary Dozer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boxer, who has maintained his innocence, said in a  
statement: ``I would like to thank all my fans for standing by me 
in these moments of crisis. I am your champion now and always will 
be your champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants were accused of assaulting Doug Rossi, 23, who  
had broken up a fight between Vargas and a female friend's 
ex-boyfriend, sheriff's Sgt. Bill Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight took place eight days after Vargas, whose professional  
record is 17-0 with 17 knockouts, defended his title by defeating 
Raul Marquez.

<HEADLINE> Sonics Sign Forward Vin Baker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle SuperSonics, who did a rebuilding job  
in the free-agent market after missing the playoffs for the first 
time in nine seasons, on Wednesday signed forward Vin Baker to a 
seven-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, 27, a four-time All-Star coming off his worst season, had  
decided to terminate the remainder of his contract by opting for 
free agency as of July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	He was free to sign with any club as of Thursday but had said  
his first choice was to remain with the Sonics. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum he could receive would be a seven-year contract  
worth nearly $87 million from the Sonics. He could lose more than 
$20 million by signing with another club. The only ones with enough 
room under the salary cap to sign him are Toronto, Chicago and the 
Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-11 power forward would have received more than $2  
million under his old contract, scheduled to run through 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	In a season shortened by the players' strike, Baker reported to  
training camp about 20 pounds overweight, missed 16 games with 
thumb and knee injuries and averaged 13.8 points and 6.2 rebounds. 
His previous lows were 13.5 points and 7.8 rebounds in his rookie 
season with Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker came to the Sonics on Sept. 25, 1997, in a three-way trade  
with Milwaukee and Cleveland. Shawn Kemp left Seattle and wound up 
with the Cavaliers in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Sonics signed free agent center Greg Foster to a  
three-year, $5 million contract. He played last season for Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Sonics went 25-25 last season, team president and  
general manager Wally Walker dumped 10 players and added six, 
including Horace Grant, Vernon Maxwell, Ruben Patterson and Brent 
Barry.

<HEADLINE> Drug Use Among Ari. Teens High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- For Scott Gwin, drugs are a part of everyday  
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Weed, coke, speed. Most of my friends do it,'' the 15-year-old  
Central High School student said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwin insists it's easy for teens in Phoenix to get drugs at  
school, around the corner, anywhere -- and a new government survey 
suggests they do. 
</P>
<P>
	Illicit drug use among Arizona teen-agers has dropped 3 percent  
since 1997, but remains significantly higher than use among their 
peers nationwide, according to a survey released Wednesday by the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The portion of Arizonans ages 12 to 17 who last year said they  
have used drugs was nearly 24 percent, the study found -- the worst 
figure in the country and far above the national average of 16.4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	And no state had more teens smoking cigarettes last year, with  
20.9 percent saying they'd had a drag within the previous month. 
The U.S. average is 18.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I smoke cigarettes to get away from my problems,'' said Lilly  
Rhianna, a 14-year-old student whose mother took her cigarettes 
away this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said easy access to drugs and family problems were to  
blame for the state's poor showing. Teens at Central High seemed to 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't start young, they catch on during high school,''  
said Norman Harley, 16. ``They see others doing it, or their moms 
and pops or friends. It's just something to get into.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall drug use among Americans of all ages remained level last  
year, but use among young adults continued its steady rise, 
according to the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, which 
included answers from 25,500 people ages 12 and up. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, 78 million Americans have tried illegal drugs, the  
survey said. Marijuana remained the most popular drug, but 41.3 
million Americans also have tried heroin, cocaine or some other 
illegal drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Of them, 13.6 million were current users -- about 6.2 percent of  
all Americans and half what it was at its 1979 peak. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also measures alcohol consumption, which was steady  
last year, and cigarette smoking, which fell to its lowest level 
since 1971 when the survey began. Last year, 27.7 percent of 
Americans smoked, with teen smoking unchanged and smoking among 
young adults continuing to rise. Cigar smoking edged up. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey -- carefully watched as a gauge of illicit drug use  
among teens -- also found 9.9 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds had 
used some sort of drugs within the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of California and Arizona were oversampled to study  
effects of voter initiatives to legalize some illicit drugs for 
medical use. Arizona Gov. Jane Dee Hull's office had not seen the 
report and declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 11.5 percent of Arizona teens reported they were current  
marijuana users, compared with 7.4 percent in California and 8.3 
percent in the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found that while overall teen drug use has  
dropped in Arizona since 1997, the number of current cocaine users 
ages 12 to 17 increased from 1.9 percent to 2.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Terri Leveton, director of chemical dependency treatment at  
Samaritan Behavior Health Services in Scottsdale, said she's not 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crack is the most prevalent because it's easily accessible and  
it's relatively cheap,'' Leveton said. ``It's easy to make and 
there's a whole system of dealers in place in Arizona.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leveton said the high percentage of teen drug use also indicates  
a much larger problem in Arizona: family problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's definitely correlations between substance abuse and  
family crisis,'' Leveton said. ``With Arizona having the highest 
statistics of child abuse, it just makes sense to me that we'd have 
the highest number of children who are self-medicating at an early 
age, especially when they see it in their home.''

<HEADLINE> Swiss Threaten Bosnia Aid Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Switzerland threatened today  
to review its aid program to Bosnia after international officials 
said corrupt Muslim, Croat and Serb authorities may have stolen 
more than $1 billion in public funds and foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief international official in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  
meanwhile, warned that Bosnia has no future unless it faces the 
corruption issue squarely. The United States and other donor 
nations have poured about $5.1 billion into Bosnia since the 1995 
Dayton peace agreement ended 3 1/2 years of ethnic conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Alexandra Stiglmayer, spokeswoman for the Office of  
the High Representative, confirmed that an American-run anti-fraud 
unit had uncovered evidence indicating that more than $1 billion, 
most of it from Bosnian public funds, had been misappropriated. 
</P>
<P>
	The OHR oversees compliance with the Dayton accord.  
</P>
<P>
	Craig Buck, USAID mission director for Bosnia, Montenegro and  
Kosovo, told reporters Tuesday in Washington that he was 
``absolutely confident'' there had been no diversion of U.S. funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Buck acknowledged, however, that his agency had so far not  
recovered about $500,000 in loans to the Bosnia and Herzegovina 
Bank, which collapsed. USAID was providing funds to the bank to 
loan to private businessmen in an effort to revive commerce and 
industry in the country. He said USAID was taking unspecified steps 
to get back the money. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bern, an official of the Swiss development agency, Reinhard  
Voegele, said about $987,000, in aid money had been tied up by the 
bank failure and if the problem is not resolved, Switzerland will 
``reconsider'' its commitment to rebuilding Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	A European Union spokesman, Thierry Daman, said in Brussels that  
the EU had no comment on the issue and that ``we are in the process 
of checking with the services concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first press conference here, the newly appointed High  
Representative, Wolfgang Petritsch, said combatting corruption in 
Bosnia would be among his highest priorities ``because, otherwise, 
there is not going to be a future for this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bosnian officials, however, appeared more concerned about damage  
to the country's reputation. Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of the 
Muslim government for much of the Bosnian war, said the corruption 
charge ``has done immense damage to Bosnia,'' coming at a time when 
the country is trying to win the confidence of international 
financial organizations and investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Alija Izetbegovic, the Muslim member of the country's three-man  
presidency, disputed the report and claimed it was an attempt by 
Bosnia's enemies to undermine reconstruction. Izetbegovic called on 
the OHR to release the report detailing alleged corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources in the High Representative's office, speaking on  
condition of anonymity, said much of the allegations involve 
misappropriation in the northern city of Tuzla. They also said the 
allegations are contained in several reports, not a single 
document.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bancorp Sues Over Web Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The nation's 13th-largest bank holding  
company is suing a banking firm many times its junior over the use 
of an Internet address. 
</P>
<P>
	Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp is suing USABanc.com Inc. to stop  
it from using the Internet address www.usabanc.com. 
</P>
<P>
	With $77 billion in assets, U.S. Bancorp fears the online  
banking business launched Monday will confuse customers looking for 
its own World Wide Web site at www.usbank.com. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in Minneapolis ordered USABanc.com to suspend  
use of its site and halt advertising until the name dispute is 
cleared up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've invested literally millions of dollars in our name and  
service marks. It's central to our identity,'' said Don Waage, a 
spokesman for U.S. Bank, a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp. ``We think 
that having others' identity mingled and confused with ours erodes 
the value that we're building in our name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	USABanc.com has $230 million in assets and three Philadelphia  
area branches. The company was known as USABancshares until the 
spring, when it decided to abandon traditional community banking to 
focus on doing business over the Internet. It had registered for 
its Internet address two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But a trademark attorney said that the timing of the  
registration may not matter in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who registered first isn't the issue,'' said Michael Cohen, an  
intellectual property lawyer at the Merchant &AMP; Gould law firm in 
Minneapolis, who is not representing either party. ``The question 
is: Is there a likelihood of confusion?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before USABanc went virtual, the two companies peacefully  
co-existed. But the Web made USABanc an international company, 
thrusting it into competition with U.S. Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doing business on the Internet exposes you to a whole variety  
of laws that you may not have had to consider when you were just 
doing business within the confines of your own state,'' Cohen said.

<HEADLINE> Alcan May Seek Some Reynolds Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The battle for Reynolds Metals Inc. became  
a bit more complicated as Alcan Aluminium Ltd. disclosed it has no 
plans to bid for the whole company, but would be interested if 
Reynolds decided to sell some assets. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, two suitors have made offers for the nation's  
third-largest aluminum company. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh-based Alcoa, the largest aluminum producer, has made  
a hostile bid for Reynolds worth $65 a share, or about $4.2 
billion. Chicago-based investment group Michigan Avenue Partners 
has also made a bid, but has not disclosed details other than to 
say it's higher that Alcoa's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds has said that the company is open to ``exploring all  
alternatives to maximize shareholder value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, however, Reynolds' board rejected Alcoa's bid, saying  
it was not good enough. Alcoa subsequently took its all-cash bid to 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcan spokesman Marcel Barthe said Wednesday that APA, Alcan's  
parent company, would not participate in the bidding for Reynolds. 
``Things might evolve differently in the weeks to come if 
circumstances evolve if the Reynolds assets are not sold in one 
unit,'' Barthe added. 
</P>
<P>
	An Alcan offer -- even for a part of Reynolds -- will not happen  
any time soon, said J. Clarence Morrison, senior metals analyst at 
Prudential Securities. The Canadian aluminum maker last week 
announced its own merger with Pechiney SA of France and 
Switzerland's Alusuisse Lonza Group and has its hands full. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed mergers are taking place near the end of what has  
been a devastating decade for the aluminum business. The collapse 
of the Soviet Union, one of the biggest aluminum producers, caused 
a number of Russian companies to flood the market with aluminum as 
they sought foreign currency, pushing prices down. 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis in Asia, Russia and Latin America  
also depressed the market. As a result, a number of companies have 
been seeking partners and shedding assets in an attempt to 
streamline operations and reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcan's expression of interest does raise the possibility of a  
spinoff, said Lloyd O'Carroll, an analyst at Scott and Stringfellow 
in Richmond and former chief economist at Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the options in selling Reynolds is to find buyers for  
all of the various assets and then see whether the total proceeds 
would be higher than what Alcoa or Michigan Avenue have offered for 
the whole thing,'' O'Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Reynolds can present a credible threat to spin the company  
off, it could bring in more money for shareholders either directly 
or by forcing Reynolds' suitors to raise their offering price, said 
Robert Dammon, an assistant professor of finance at the 
Carnegie-Mellon University Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Reynolds has accepted they're going to be sold and  
they're making an effort to bid the price up,'' Dammon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now their efforts are going to be focussed on doing the  
best for their shareholders,'' Dammon said. ``One tactic they might 
follow to get the best price is to threaten Alcoa with selling the 
assets of the company piecemeal. Alcoa certainly wouldn't want that 
to happen. That may force Alcoa's hand and raise the price a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alcan is particularly interested in some of the ``crown jewels''  
of Reynolds' aluminum assets -- two smelters in Canada and a 
refinery in Australia, said O'Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcan, already the world's second largest aluminum foil producer  
behind Reynolds, might face antitrust problems if it were to 
acquire Reynolds' consumer packaging business, O'Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Reynolds fell 25 cents to $68.25 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Bank Error Nets Man Surprise Fortune </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- When $1.6 million showed up in his  
checking account, Roger Dudley made the most of it. He invested 
thousands, bought gifts for his wife, and paid off his truck and 
credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he may face federal charges.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was nice while it lasted,'' said Dudley, 21. ``Someday I'll  
say, `I remember when I was a millionaire.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Secret Service and federal prosecutors are reviewing the  
case. Officials at AmSouth Bank said no charges had been filed as 
of Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley told WAAY-TV he discovered the extra money in his AmSouth  
account when he asked for his balance about two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a dream and a nightmare at the same time,'' he said.  
``Reality didn't set in for a couple of days. It mixes you up 
bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley kept most of the money in the bank. But he still spent  
plenty, buying 7,000 shares of AmSouth mutual funds and an airplane 
ticket and earrings for his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	The fortune vanished almost as quickly as it appeared: Federal  
agents met Dudley at the bank on Monday, and the account was 
frozen. 
</P>
<P>
	AmSouth Bank spokesman Jim Underwood said the mistake apparently  
resulted from a printing error when another customer ordered new 
deposit slips. Underwood did not identify the customer whose money 
went into Dudley's account, but WAAY reported it was a hospital in 
Mobile. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood said customers must notify the bank if extra money  
shows up in an account.

<HEADLINE> Panthers' Bure Says Knee Feels Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POMPANO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Pavel Bure's surgically repaired knee  
is holding up through his first hockey action in six months, 
leaving the Florida Panthers marquee player optimistic he'll be 
ready for the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-scoring right wing has been working out with about 20  
other Russian players at an informal training camp scheduled to run 
through next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously I'm going to be a little rusty, but it feels pretty  
good,'' Bure said Tuesday. ``I'm ahead of schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure skated four times last month in brief sessions without  
equipment at the Red Army team's facility in Moscow. Now he's 
wearing pads and a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared tentative at first, but has been gaining confidence  
as he goes. Bure made it through the first two-hour session and 
walked through the parking lot without a limp as he signed 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to do it is on the ice, one step at a time. It  
can't happen overnight,'' said Bure, who only showed flashes of his 
ability with 13 goals in 11 games last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have to be in a game situation, going full speed  
with someone alongside pushing me to build up trust in the knee 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure came to the Panthers from Vancouver last January, ending a  
lengthy contract dispute. He scored eight goals in his first seven 
games, and the Panthers rewarded him with a five-year contract 
worth $47.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	After twisting his right knee, Bure missed nine games.  
</P>

	Bure's season came to an end March 3 after a hit by Colorado's  
Adam Foote led to season-ending knee surgery. Three weeks later, 
the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee had to be rebuilt for 
the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure, 28, completed 12 weeks of formal rehabilitation by the end  
of June, working out six days a week at the Cleveland Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very good worker, very patient and smart,'' said Mary  
Ann Towne, the clinic's rehabilitation services director who is 
monitoring Bure's progress. ``His knee is stable. The biggest issue 
now is confidence, and the more he skates, the more confident he 
will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers open training camp Sept. 3 in Hull, Quebec, with  
the season opener Oct. 2. Club president Bill Torrey has little 
doubt his franchise player will be available. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what this guy is all about,'' Torrey said. ``He'll be  
back, and he'll be every bit of the player he was before.''

<HEADLINE> Three Insurers Sued for $100M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UPPER MARLBORO, Md. (AP) -- Three major insurance companies were  
sued for $100 million each Wednesday by customers who accused them 
of failing to fully pay for medical expenses and lost wages after 
automobile accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the seven people who filed the lawsuits said they  
expected many other plaintiffs to join the Maryland lawsuits naming 
Allstate Insurance, Geico, and State Farm Mutual Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people have paid premiums expecting that in the event of  
an accident that their medical bills would be paid,'' said Joseph 
Cammarata, one attorney representing individuals in the 
class-action suits filed in Prince George's County Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits allege the companies use computer programs, medical  
record reviewers and doctors to shortchange customers who file 
personal injury protection claims following the crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is happening is that they are 'nickeling and diming'  
policyholders on a systematic basis in order to keep costs down,'' 
said Cammarata, who is handling the cases with attorney Ira 
Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Geico and Allstate said they would not comment  
until company attorneys review the complaints, but a State Farm 
spokesman defended the practice of reviewing claims to determine 
appropriate charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps to keep the costs of insurance down for our  
customers,'' said Charles Ingram. 
</P>
<P>
	Each lawsuit seeks $100 million in punitive and compensatory  
damages. The lawyers said they expect ``thousands if not hundreds 
of thousands'' of people to become parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reviewing medical bills is not just rubber-stamping them for  
payment,'' said David Snyder, assistant general counsel for the 
American Insurance Association. The Washington-based trade 
association contends that preventing fraudulent treatment and 
overbilling is in consumers' best interest. ``It means that 
ratepayers are not being stuck with huge bills,'' Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Records filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  
indicate authorities in five states are pursuing lawsuits against 
Allstate over company mailers suggesting that those involved in 
accidents with its policyholders can settle their cases without 
legal representation. Allstate is also the target of five 
prospective class-action suits alleging consumer fraud and the 
unauthorized practice of law. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, a state appeals court in Washington state reinstated a  
class-action lawsuit against State Farm that alleges the company 
improperly denied medical reimbursement claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Cammarata said he believes the Maryland cases will become a  
national effort. They were filed in Maryland because all the 
plaintiffs live in suburban counties outside the nation's capital, 
but the lawyers said anyone who has had medical benefits reduced or 
denied could become a party. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been three years and I still have outstanding benefits  
that have not been paid, up to $5,900,'' said LaCountess Corbitt of 
Lanham. Corbitt had $10,000 in medical benefit and lost wages 
coverage with State Farm when she was in an accident May 25, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was severely injured, I was out of work,'' said Corbitt,  
saying her medical bills and lost wages caused her to fall behind 
on other bills and presented a financial hardship. 
</P>
<P>
	George Lewis of Fort Washington had coverage worth $7,500 when  
he was injured in a traffic accident Jan. 12, 1998. He contends 
Geico failed to pay $3,028 in reasonable benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert Ostrof of Silver Spring acknowledged his losses were  
minor, but said State Farm's reduction of benefits by $87 after an 
Oct. 13, 1998 fender bender is ``a matter of principle and fraud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of the plaintiffs have maintained coverage with the  
insurers.

<HEADLINE> Mom Acquitted of Shooting Daughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A frail woman was acquitted Wednesday of  
attempting to kill her daughter, who was left paralyzed from the 
shooting and later died when a court granted her permission to 
remove herself from life support. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury deliberated for seven hours before acquitting 68-year-old  
Shirley Egan of attempted murder, which carries a maximum sentence 
of life in prison. Ms. Egan, an 85-pound woman who is blind in one 
eye and has emphysema, smiled and squeezed her attorney's hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, she said she didn't mean to shoot her daughter.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's up there with God, I pray to her in God's hands,'' Ms.  
Egan said later. ``She was my best friend; we were together our 
whole lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Ms. Egan opened fire after hearing her daughter,  
Georgette Smith, and her daughter's boyfriend, Larry Videlock, 
talking about putting the 85-pound woman in a nursing home. 
Videlock was not hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith, 42, was paralyzed from the neck down, left barely  
able to speak and incapable of swallowing or controlling her 
bladder. In May, she won the right to be taken off life support. 
</P>
<P>
	The day before she died, Ms. Smith gave a 20-minute videotaped  
deposition in which she said her mother didn't mean to shoot her 
when she opened fire. Jurors were riveted as they watched the tape 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it was an accident,'' Ms. Smith said, struggling to  
pronounce each word. ``I know it was. She can't see that good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney Lawson Lamar decided against bringing a murder  
charge, citing Ms. Egan's poor health and closeness with her 
daughter. Even so, prosecutors said the shooting was deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no accident when you pull this firearm and you aim it at  
two victims and you use your finger to pull this back,'' prosecutor 
Pam Smith told jurors, holding up the gun. 
</P>
<P>
	But defense attorney Bob Wesley told the jury that Ms. Egan was  
involuntarily intoxicated from prescription drugs and didn't intend 
to shoot the couple. ``She is not to be blamed,'' Wesley said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia 0, Croatia 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia and Croatia played to a  
0-0 tie Wednesday in a Euro 200 qualifier delayed for 40 minutes 
because of a blackout at the Belgrade stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The first match between the countries since the bloody 1991 war  
that officially ended only in 1995 included a huge element of 
national pride. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was postponed from March 27 because of NATO's bombing  
of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams played nervously, controlling the midfield and trying  
to launch attacks with long passes. Croatia controlled the play 
late in the first half, but Yugoslavia took over in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav striker Predrag Mijatovic hit the left goal post in the  
opening minute, and Croatia's Davor Suker struck the right post 
with a low shot in the 23rd minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Croatia had another good chance in the 35th minute when Yugoslav  
defender Sinisa Mihajlovic's diving header hit his own goal's 
crossbar following a cross by Croatia's defender Robert Jarni. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second half, the only real opportunity came in the 79th  
minute when Yugoslav free-kick specialist Mihajlovic fired from 
some 30 yards, but Croatian goalkeeper Drazen Ladic made a 
spectacular one-handed save. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a 40-minute blackout at the Red Star stadium starting  
in the 49th minute, with 50,000 fans chanting ``Slobo Go Away'' and 
``Red Bandits,'' referring to autocratic Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic. A tear gas canister was launched at one of the 
stands, but there were no injuries.

<HEADLINE> Alabama University Supports Sorensen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- University of Alabama President Andrew  
Sorensen said he supports football coach Mike DuBose, despite a 
sexual harassment case involving DuBose and a university employee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorensen said comments he made about DuBose last week were taken  
out of context. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters after a Board of Trustees meeting on the  
DuBose matter, Sorensen was quoted as saying he didn't know if he 
could trust DuBose to follow NCAA rules in the wake of the sexual 
harassment claim against the coach, who admitted that he misled the 
public when he denied rumors about him and an employee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Sorensen spoke to the football team before practice.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told them I'm committed to do all in my power to ensure the  
success of coach DuBose, the assistant coaches and all the players 
on the team,'' Sorensen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The school settled the claim with the university employee for  
$350,000 and cut DuBose's salary by $360,000 over three years in a 
separate action. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a press conference last week my comments about NCAA  
compliance were misinterpreted,'' Sorensen said. ``I'm extremely 
proud of our compliance program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sorensen also said he believed his and DuBose's relationship  
would be restored to where it previously was. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose said he appreciated the show of support.  
</P>
<P>
	``That means an awful lot,'' DuBose said. ``He understands I'm  
very sorry for the things I've done. I don't need to keep saying 
it, but at the same time it's easy for me to say all the right 
things. I've got to do all the right things. A lot of it is wait 
and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sorensen said he meets with the team twice a year -- once in the  
spring and once in the fall -- ``whether they need it or not.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Said More Prepared for Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Far fewer people would die if an earthquake  
like the one that struck Turkey were to rock urban Southern 
California or the San Francisco Bay area, experts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advanced construction techniques and strict building codes  
should prevent a disaster like the one visited on Turkey, according 
to experts. As many as 4,000 people may have died and tens of 
thousands are injured or missing in the aftermath of Tuesday's 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Many buildings that collapsed in the magnitude-7.4 quake may not  
have adhered to standards such as those in force in much of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be somewhat better off but not complacent,'' said  
Lucy Jones, chief scientist for the U.S. Geological Survey in 
Southern California. ``Even though we have modern construction, we 
have older buildings too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California's modern earthquake safety law was enacted following  
the 1933 Long Beach quake that killed 120 people. It has been 
updated with subsequent quakes, particularly the 1971 San Fernando 
shaker that left 65 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1994 Northridge quake, the city of Los Angeles  
instituted tougher inspections of steel-frame high-rises after 
welds in some buildings cracked during the shaking. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some warn that urban California has never sustained a  
direct hit by a strong quake. The strongest shaking in the 
Northridge and 1984 Loma Prieta quakes occurred far from populated 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're right up within a mile of a really big fault, you  
have really big motions,'' Ms. Jones said. ``That level of movement 
hasn't been incorporated into the building codes. How bad will it 
be? We really don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In California, older buildings, particularly those constructed  
of unreinforced brick, pose the biggest threat, said Ron Hamburger, 
senior vice president of the risk consulting firm EQE 
International. 
</P>
<P>
	A magnitude-7.0 quake on the Hayward Fault, east of San  
Francisco, could result in a death toll in the low thousands and 
cause $50 billion in damage, he said. A similar quake in the more 
densely populated Los Angeles Basin also could kill thousands and 
cause up to $250 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In Turkey, nearly 3,900 people are known dead, 18,500 were  
injured and more than 10,000 were still missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The fallout of such a strong quake in California would vary  
depending on a number of factors, including when the tremor hits, 
Ms. Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	A nighttime earthquake in California would lead to fewer losses  
than a daytime quake because residents tend to live in flexible, 
wood-frame homes, not the concrete apartment high-rises common in 
Turkey. Californians also are less likely to be working inside the 
most dangerous buildings at night. 
</P>
<P>
	In Istanbul, contractors have made a killing by throwing up  
slapdash, concrete-and-cinderblock apartment blocks to house 
millions of rural Turks looking for work. When the earthquake hit, 
many of the cheaply made, never-inspected housing blocks pancaked 
into the ground, crushing thousands as they slept. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the region has suffered several quakes over the past  
decade, experts say little has been done to address the problems of 
contractors who don't bother with permits and skimp on materials, 
or corrupt officials who don't enforce building codes. 
</P>
<P>
	Code enforcement is also an issue in California, said Jim  
Slosson, former state geologist and former commissioner of the 
Seismic Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Many buildings that collapsed in Northridge, for example, were  
found to have been defective -- with bad welds, improper braces or 
the wrong-size nails. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd be very foolish to think that this is only an issue in  
Turkey,'' Ms. Jones said. ``If you skimp, it might not matter in 
the first few years. But as nails rust, you have less of a buffer. 
Then the skimping makes more of a difference.''

<HEADLINE> Australia, Japan in Tuna Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Australia and New Zealand went before an  
international tribunal Wednesday to try to freeze Japan's 
experimental bluefin tuna fishing program. 
</P>
<P>
	The case before the International Tribunal for the Law of the  
Sea aims to secure a temporary injunction halting the program. A 
verdict is expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian attorney-general Daryl Williams rejected Japan's  
argument that the catches were needed for scientific purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	``That excuse cannot prevail,'' he said, presenting his  
country's case as the three-day hearing opened. ``Japan is 
endangering the stock of southern bluefin tuna.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement distributed at the hearing, the Japanese  
government challenged charges by Australia and New Zealand and 
offered to hold talks on catch quotas for the prized fish. 
</P>
<P>
	The three countries agreed on quotas for bluefins in 1985. Japan  
started experimental fishing after failing to win a higher quota in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hamburg-based tribunal rules in disputes between countries  
that have joined the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said the tuna issue -- only the second case before the  
tribunal -- was a test of its ability to resolve fishing disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribunal is expected to announce a verdict next week.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Reviews Papers About Diana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is taking a second look at U.S.  
intelligence documents containing references to the late Princess 
Diana at the request of Mohamed Al Fayed, the father of her 
boyfriend Dodi Fayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Tuesday an initial review  
of the documents in May yielded no information useful to the 
investigation of the Paris car accident that killed Diana and Fayed 
in August 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Tyrer, the chief of staff to Defense Secretary William  
Cohen, agreed to review the papers again, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not anticipate that a re-review of the documents will  
reach a different conclusion than we've already reached, which is 
there is nothing in these documents that relates in any way to 
information explaining the circumstances of the death of Princess 
Diana,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December Al Fayed said he talked to the French judge  
handling the accident investigation about alleged British and 
American surveillance of his son and the princess before their 
deaths. Al Fayed claimed the British secret services had enlisted 
the CIA to help follow the couple. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Fayed contended in a lawsuit filed last month that four  
people sold him bogus documents indicating the deaths were the work 
of a carefully planned assassination. He accused a Beverly Hills 
attorney and two of the attorney's associates of forging documents 
purporting to be secret files from the CIA and the MI6, a British 
intelligence agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Fayed has said he believes the car crash was a conspiracy  
plotted by people who did not want the future king of England to 
have an Egyptian stepfather. Diana's eldest son, Prince William, is 
in line to become king. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Fayed owns Harrod's department store in London and the Ritz  
Hotel in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon declined to discuss the nature of the documents under  
review except to say they number ``several dozen'' and were 
generated ``in ordinary operations.'' He said, for example, that 
they may include reports from American embassies on the public 
reception received by Diana and Prince Charles on trips abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, the U.S. government acknowledged that  
intelligence documents compiled by the National Security Agency 
over many years included mention of Diana on 1,056 pages. They said 
the references were incidental and that she was never a target of 
U.S. intelligence operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that NSA agents picked up mentions of Diana in  
international electronic monitoring was disclosed when the agency 
denied a Freedom of Information Act request by APB News, an 
Internet news service, for any intercepts mentioning her. 
</P>
<P>
	In a November 1998 letter denying APB News' request, the NSA  
acknowledged the existence of 1,056 pages of intelligence documents 
containing references to Diana. They include 124 ``top secret'' 
pages originated and controlled by the NSA which, if released, 
could reasonably be expected to cause ``exceptionally grave damage 
to the national security,'' according to the NSA's rejection 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The NSA, which monitors electronic communications abroad and  
protects U.S. communications from foreign intercepts, is under the 
control of the secretary of defense.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Jockey Brokers Deal for Horse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Billy Peterson always had a knack for  
spotting a fast horse as one of the best quarter-horse jockeys and 
still does as a stock broker in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson, who won the 1995 All American Futurity with Winalota  
Cash, left the saddle for Wall Street two years later. It wasn't an 
easy decision and Peterson has been unable, and unwilling, to shake 
his love for horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still in my blood,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	But for his clients and the 20 pounds he's put on since he quit  
riding, Peterson might be aboard the 2-year-old gelding Mahogany 
Lane in one of Thursday's 17 trial races involving 166 horses at 
Ruidoso Downs that will determine the field for this year's $2 
million All American. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 horses with the fastest times from the trials at a  
distance of 440 yards advance to the futurity Sept. 6, with the 
winner earning $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to Peterson, Mahogany Lane and owner Johnny Trujillo are  
getting a chance to qualify for the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The purse for the All American is built up through a series of  
payments made by the owners of the horses nominated. If a horse is 
nominated while still a weanling, the owner will end up paying 
$3,550 by the time the trials roll around. But if a horse isn't 
initially nominated, the owner has to pay a late supplemental fee 
of $50,000 to get his horse into the trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahogany Lane wasn't an original nominee and Trujillo couldn't  
afford to put up the $50,000 by himself. Peterson intervened and 
brokered a deal between Trujillo and four Texas businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The four Texas investors, led by Frank Richardson of Houston,  
agreed to pay the late fee in exchange for half the horse's 
earnings if he qualifies for the All American. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt he had the credentials to go down there and run with  
the big boys,'' Peterson said this week in a telephone interview 
from his office in Utah. ``He has some breeding that doesn't jump 
off the page ... but he's one of those that has the talent anyway. 
He's darn sure a runner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mahogany Lane has won four of his five races this summer, the  
only defeat a fourth in the $200,000 Utah Classic at Wyoming Downs, 
where he was repeatedly bumped by other horses in the run to the 
wire. 
</P>
<P>
	Trujillo, who grew up in the northwest New Mexico village of  
Blanco, owns a ceramic tile company in Salt Lake City. He bought 
Mahogany Lane as a weanling from another Utah horseman for $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Trujillo not sent Mahogany Lane to Ruidoso Downs, the horse  
would likely have qualified for the upcoming American West 
Futurity, another $200,000 race at the Wyoming track. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking a gamble,'' Trujillo said. ``All he would need is  
a touch of luck to win the American West. He's that good a horse. 
But we're skipping that to gamble on the big dude.''

<HEADLINE> Former Dolphins Receiver Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ga. (AP) -- James Pruitt, a wide receiver who played  
three seasons with the Miami Dolphins in the 1980s, was one of four 
people arrested Tuesday by federal drug agents who also seized four 
kilograms of cocaine and $27,000 cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests by a narcotics task force occurred at Pruitt's  
Columbus home. Pruitt, 35, was charged with drug trafficking, along 
with Crystal Pugh, 26, of Columbus, and Hector Devalle, 23, of 
Delray, Fla. Monica Hood, of Columbus, was charged with disorderly 
conduct as police served the warrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Pruitt played with the Dolphins from 1986 to 1988, mostly as a  
backup to Mark Clayton and Mark Duper. A native of Los Angeles, 
Pruitt attended Fullerton State. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the cocaine they seized is worth an estimated  
$400,000.

<HEADLINE> Jays' Escobar Is Sent to Bullpen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Struggling right-hander Kelvim Escobar was sent  
to the bullpen by the Toronto Blue Jays and replaced in the 
rotation by Roy Halladay. 
</P>
<P>
	Escobar, (10-9) with a 6.13 ERA, struggled this season after  
going 7-3 with 3.73 last year. He gave up seven runs in 4 1-3 
innings during his last start. 
</P>
<P>
	``His stuff is good, but his location is off at times and he  
doesn't use all his pitches,'' Toronto manager Jim Fregosi said. 
``When he comes out of the bullpen he won't have to use all his 
pitches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Escobar, 23, had 14 saves as the Blue Jays closer in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	Toronto entered Wednesday with a six-game losing streak, and its  
starters allowed 28 runs in 22 innings during the last five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi has also decided to give struggling right-hander Pat  
Hentgen an extra two days' rest. 
</P>
<P>
	In Toronto's 8-5 loss to Seattle on Tuesday night, Hentgen  
(7-10) lost his third straight start as he gave up seven runs and 
nine hits in six innings.

<HEADLINE> Teachers in Swing Case Can Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The public backlash over the unpaid  
suspensions of two teachers caught in a private sex club has helped 
the educators get back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the teachers will not be returning to the classroom.  
</P>
<P>
	The Broward County school board voted Tuesday to pay Kenneth  
Springer and Tonya Whyte their salaries for up to nine months and 
assign them to other tasks in the district until an administrative 
judge hears their cases of alleged immorality. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer, a teacher at South Broward High School, and Whyte, a  
teacher at Deerfield Beach High School, were arrested in January 
along with 19 other people during a raid at a now-defunct club in 
Pompano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer was there with his wife and Whyte was there with a male  
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were charged with lewd and lascivious conduct, though the  
charges against Springer have been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the board voted 8-1 to suspend the teachers  
without pay. Board member Miriam Oliphant raised the subject for 
reconsideration after complaints from the public and her own 
concerns about whether the board was attempting to police morality. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did not happen on a child. It did not happen on our  
property,'' Oliphant said. ``Everybody I've talked to said this 
should not be here on our agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the public who attended Tuesday's board meeting spoke  
overwhelmingly in favor of the board dropping proceedings against 
the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we going to start becoming witch hunters? This is  
absolutely ludicrous,'' said Lori Glasser. 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers did not attend the meeting. There was no telephone  
listing for Whyte, and Springer did not return repeated calls for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were obviously looking for a total exoneration, but as a  
fallback position, we'll take this,'' said Anthony Gentile, 
president of the Broward Teachers Union, who spoke on the teachers' 
behalf.

<HEADLINE> Army Turns to Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Army is going Hollywood in an effort to  
boost the quality of training for soldiers and make simulated war 
exercises more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army signed a five-year, $44.3 million contract today with  
the University of Southern California to establish a research 
center to develop better military simulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The military wants to use Hollywood's talent and creativity to  
create training programs for soldiers with ``very real story and 
character content to prepare them for the missions they're going to 
do,'' Army Secretary Louis Caldera said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The center will use film students and video game designers to  
make the simulations, using the latest technology and advances in 
virtual reality and artificial intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, the entertainment industry would be able to use the  
technology to improve special effects in movies, make more 
realistic video games and improve theme park rides. New technology 
could also be used to reduce the cost of motion picture and 
television production by using more virtual sets and more realistic 
digital actors. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea to use Hollywood's technological know-how for military  
applications arose several years ago when defense officials 
realized that video game and special effects technology could be 
helpful for military simulations. The National Research Council 
recommended two years ago that the defense and entertainment 
industries should collaborate on advancing simulation techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	Both university officials and the Pentagon hope the center, to  
be called the Institute for Creative Technologies, will put 
military training scenarios on the cutting edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to make our training much more realistic,'' said  
William Bond, commanding general of the Army's Simulation Training 
Instrumentation Command in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the ability to create a state where the soldier feels  
this is so real that he actually perspires, his heart rate goes up, 
and he reacts in a manner that is consistent with what he would do 
in a real environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linking with the private sector and using the advances of  
commercial technology could save the Pentagon money and speed its 
technology development, said Michael Macedonia, chief scientist at 
the Orlando training center. 
</P>
<P>
	Film and game companies are expected to contribute money and  
experience, including storytelling techniques and computer special 
effects. It is not clear how many will take part in the venture 
since recruitment of outside companies has just begun. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army wants filmmakers to make simulated characters more  
realistic and devise story lines that help soldiers make decisions 
in emotionally charged situations. A scenario could combine the 
pizzazz of something like Steven Spielberg's realistic war drama 
``Saving Private Ryan'' with lifelike training scenarios derived 
from military intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials involved in the institute say its primary focus will  
not be on battle simulations, though some will be done. 
</P>
<P>
	They hope to develop simulators to help soldiers learn the  
customs of foreign countries to prepare them for the kind of 
peacekeeping missions that have taken troops on short notice to 
places like Bosnia and Kosovo. For example, a soldier could take an 
online course about an area's history, then enter a virtual reality 
where a ``guide'' could lead the soldier through a town. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles and Berkeley campuses of the University of  
California were also considered for the institute, but they didn't 
have the same relationship with the entertainment community, said 
Cathy Kominos, deputy director of Army research in Crystal City, 
Va. USC was also chosen for its strength in electrical engineering 
and computer science, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's schools of cinema-television, engineering and  
communication will also be involved in the program.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Fires Volley at AOL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. said Wednesday it would  
release code for its new Internet instant-messaging service to aid 
in development of an industrywide standard. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes as Microsoft duels with America Online Inc. over  
instant messaging, which gives Internet users the ability to 
exchange real-time notes that pop up on the recipient's computer 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's Instant Messenger service, which user base dwarfs  
Microsoft's MSN Messenger Service in number of users, has been 
refusing to allow Microsoft's subscribers to communicate with its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	The code, or ``protocol'' release is significant because it will  
aid in development of a universal standard for Internet messaging, 
which could force AOL to comply, said Vijay Saraswat, co-chairman 
of the independent Internet Engineering Task Force's working group 
on messaging. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this spirit of open protocols that benefit the entire  
Internet community, we strongly encourage other vendors to publish 
their protocols,'' he said in a Microsoft release. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has promised to release the code for its MSN Messenger  
Service to the group by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Since beginning its own service last month, Microsoft has been  
battling with AOL, which has about 43 million users to Microsoft's 
1.3 million. Both services are free. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Microsoft announced that three internet  
services -- Prodigy, Tribal Voice, and People Link -- had agreed to 
give their users the ability to instantly exchange messages with 
MSN's users.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Grace Gets One-Year Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Mark Grace, who has played for the Chicago Cubs  
his entire 12-year major league career, signed a one-year contract 
extension Wednesday believed to be worth $5.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs general manager Ed Lynch said the team wanted a longer-term  
contract, but Grace wanted only to commit for one season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't fear one-year contracts,'' Grace said. ``I've had an  
awful lot of them, at least nine or 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old first baseman said he considered testing the  
free-agent market this year but decided to wait until after next 
season. He went into Wednesday night's game against Arizona batting 
.324 with 12 home runs and 67 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, there weren't a whole lot of other situations out  
there right now,'' Grace said. ``Everything was pretty iffy. But 
with one year, there's going to be more available after next 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grace said there is a possibility he would sign with the San  
Diego Padres after next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where I'm from. I went to San Diego State,'' Grace  
said. ``It's a good place to play, so that's something we've 
thought about. Hopefully, it won't come to that. I've always said 
I'd like to end my career as a Cub, but that's certainly an 
intriguing possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he thought the Atlanta Braves might be interested  
in him after this season, considering the uncertain status of 
Andres Galarraga, who is battling cancer. But Grace decided that a 
one-year contract with the Cubs was the best way to go, even though 
Chicago is mired in last place in the NL Central. 
</P>
<P>
	Grace, a three-time NL All-Star and four-time Gold Glove winner,  
has a career .311 average with 403 doubles, 133 home runs and 898 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Grace ranks in the career top 10 in 11 offensive categories for  
the Cubs, including batting, hits, extra-base hits, games played, 
runs scored and RBIs. He is the second player in Cubs' history to 
be the opening day starter at the same position for an entire 
decade. The other was first baseman Cap Anson in the 1880s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly an exception now when a guy plays as long as  
Mark has with one club,'' Lynch said. ``You can count on one hand 
the guys who have had success solely with one club -- the Tony 
Gwynns of the world, the Cal Ripkens. Mark is certainly in that 
category in terms of longevity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grace expects that he, Sammy Sosa and Henry Rodriguez will be  
back to form the heart of Chicago's offense next season. But he 
knows changes are coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret there's going to be some new faces here next  
year, I would imagine,'' Grace said. ``Somehow, some way, we've got 
to have a more consistent lineup. We've got to have more consistent 
defense and more consistent pitching. It hasn't been one area. It 
has been a lot of areas for us.''

<HEADLINE> Court Keeps Starr Probe Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A divided federal court has given Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr authority to continue his investigation of 
President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, even as there were fresh 
indications Starr wants to quit before the job is done. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing Starr's ``unusually productive'' record of 24  
indictments, 16 convictions and a presidential impeachment during 
his five-year probe, two Republican-appointed appeals court judges 
wrote Wednesday that they gave Starr the go-ahead to carry on after 
he said his work wasn't finished. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has said his office was trying to wrap up its work and  
there has been speculation he might leave office before a final 
report was filed. Starr said Wednesday his office was working with 
the Justice Department on ``whether appropriate matters can be 
referred back to the department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials have told Starr they probably would  
be unable to take over his unfinished investigation, a department 
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr told U.S. Court of Appeals Judge David Sentelle, who  
presides over the three-judge panel, on Aug. 2 that he expected to 
leave the job before the end of the year, The Washington Post said 
in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC News quoted sources on its Web site Tuesday as saying Starr  
had informed the judges he hoped to leave in the next several 
months and had submitted the resumes of three deputies as possible 
successors. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office has refused comment. The independent counsel said  
last week he hoped to wrap up the investigation and write a final 
report at the ``earliest practicable moment.'' Starr told reporters 
he expected the work to be completed before the general election in 
November 2000, when Mrs. Clinton likely will be the Democratic 
nominee for a U.S. Senate seat from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In its ruling Wednesday, two members of the three-judge panel  
said the court didn't have the authority to go beyond a routine 
request to Starr asking where his work stood. The court considered 
whether Starr's probe should be terminated under a provision of the 
now-expired independent counsel law, which still applies to Starr. 
``We have never interpreted this section to empower the division 
(of the court) to supervise independent counsel,'' Sentelle, joined 
by Judge Peter Fay, wrote. ``Indeed, it could not constitutionally 
do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But dissenting Judge Peter Cudahy, a Democratic appointee, said  
Starr's past record ``is quite irrelevant'' to the future of the 
investigation and wrote that the ``endless investigation'' has gone 
on long enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also weighed in. He contended that Cudahy had a  
``fundamental misunderstanding'' of the remaining work in the probe 
of Arkansas land deals involving the president, the first lady and 
others, along with investigations into misuse of FBI files and 
firings at the White House travel office. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge court is composed of appellate judges who  
appoint independent counsels, receive their reports and settle 
legal challenges to their investigations. Sentelle and Fay pointed 
out that no such challenges were before them during the latest 
review. 
</P>
<P>
	Cudahy said he sought the majority's approval to request  
information from Starr ``about further investigative activity that 
he could usefully undertake. ... My efforts along these lines have 
been rebuffed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cudahy said the only responses he received were ``very general  
representations'' conveyed ``in an informal 'contact' between the 
independent counsel and the presiding judge (Sentelle).'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his dissenting opinion, Cudahy wrote, ``This is a natural and  
logical point for termination'' of the probe, with Clinton already 
impeached and acquitted on charges arising out of his affair with 
Monica Lewinsky, and no prosecutions pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said his office was still dealing with an appeal involving  
his prosecutions related to the Whitewater real estate venture in 
which the Clintons were partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Yannett, a former Iran-Contra prosecutor, said the dissent  
is ``a remarkable development and is illustrative of the lack of 
respect that many hold the Starr office in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But St. John's University law professor John Barrett, also an  
ex-Iran-Contra prosecutor, said the court majority was properly 
cautious in limiting its role as the Constitution requires. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentelle originally was a Ronald Reagan appointee. He is the  
only one of the three judges on the panel when it appointed Starr 
in August 1994. Fay, originally a Richard Nixon appointee, joined 
the group later that year. Cudahy, selected by Jimmy Carter, was 
named to the special court in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Satellites Measuring Wash. Monument </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Monument is a bit taller than  
previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of government geodesists on Wednesday used satellites to  
take the monument's most accurate measure ever. Their preliminary 
result was 555-feet-5.9-inches. Geodesy is the science of measuring 
the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the height of the monument has been reported as  
555-feet-5.5 inches. It was last measured 65 years ago by 
government surveyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Scaffolding erected for a renovation of the monument gave the  
team from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) access to the top of the giant stone pillar. 
</P>
<P>
	The team from NOAA'S National Geodetic Survey took several  
measurements during their visit to the apex and will report final, 
detailed figures in about a week, NOAA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Engineers will also use this information to monitor the  
monument's stability, measuring any shifting, settling, or other 
movement of the structure,'' NOAA Administrator D. James Baker said 
in a statement.He added that the same methods used in the project 
can be used for navigation and transportation and communications 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The geodesists used state-of-the-art Global Positioning System  
receivers and other specialized gear to take hundreds of 
measurements at the top of the monument and at several other nearby 
Washington landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The last official geodetic measurements from the top of the  
Washington Monument were made in 1934 by the U.S. Coast and 
Geodetic Survey, the National Geodetic Survey's predecessor agency. 
At that time, manual observations were made with instruments such 
as theodolites, spirit levels and leveling rods. 
</P>
<P>
	Such precise measurements are part of the Geodetic's Survey's  
National Spatial Reference System, which is the foundation for all 
types of surveys and allows government, industry and researchers to 
measure the position of objects in three-dimensional space.

<HEADLINE> Cone Mills To Lay Off 250 in S.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Cone Mills Corp. will trim 250 positions  
from a dyeing plant in South Carolina as demand for printed 
home-furnishings fabric has declined. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant in Carlisle, S.C., which employs about 1,070 people,  
will eliminate about 200 hourly and 50 salaried positions in the 
coming weeks, Cone Mills announced Wednesday. Some positions will 
be eliminated as early as month's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.3 million-square-foot plant provides commission dyeing,  
printing and finishing services for fabric used in home furnishings 
and apparel. 
</P>
<P>
	``In recent years, Carlisle's product mix has changed  
substantially,'' said Anthony Furr, Cone's chief financial officer. 
``In addition, volume has declined due to both lower cyclical 
demand for printed home-furnishings fabrics and the company's 
decision to streamline apparel fabrics product lines to improve 
efficiency and effectiveness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone Mills, the world's largest denim maker and North America's  
largest commission printer of home-furnishings fabrics, announced a 
companywide restructuring in recent months. The company made 
announcements earlier this year to trim its work force by 1,200 
workers to about 5,000 employees. Lower denim sales has accounted 
for much of Cone's recent sales shortfall.

<HEADLINE> Jury Considers Mother Shooting Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A jury began deliberating attempted murder  
charges today against a 68-year-old woman for the shooting that 
paralyzed her daughter, who later died after her ventilator was 
removed at her request. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments, the prosecutor said Shirley Egan knew  
precisely what she was doing when she fired a bullet into 
42-year-old Georgette Smith's neck March 8. The defense told the 
jury that Ms. Egan was under the influence of prescription drugs 
and didn't intend to shoot anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Ms. Egan opened fire after hearing her daughter and  
her daughter's boyfriend, Larry Videlock, talking about putting her 
in a nursing home. Videlock was not hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no accident when you pull this firearm and you aim it at  
two victims and you use your finger to pull this back,'' prosecutor 
Pam Smith told jurors, holding up the gun. 
</P>
<P>
	In his summation, defense attorney Bob Wesley told the jury that  
Ms. Egan was involuntarily intoxicated from prescription drugs and 
didn't intend to shoot the couple. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is not to be blamed,'' Wesley said.  
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, jurors sat riveted as they watched a videotape of  
Ms. Smith saying her mother didn't mean to shoot her when she 
opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it was an accident,'' Ms. Smith said, struggling to  
pronounce each word. ``I know it was. She can't see that good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting left Ms. Smith paralyzed from the neck down, barely  
able to speak, and incapable of swallowing or controlling her 
bladder. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms Smith's 20 minute hospital-bed deposition was taken in May,  
one day before she was taken off life support at her request and 
died. Ms. Egan, who is blind in one eye and has emphysema, clasped 
a wrinkled hand over her mouth and looked down in horror as the 
tape of her daughter was played. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love her dearly. She is the best friend,'' Ms. Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan was charged with two counts of attempted murder. State  
Attorney Lawson Lamar decided against bringing a murder charge 
after the daughter died, citing Ms. Egan's poor health and 
closeness with her daughter.

<HEADLINE>  N. Korea Ready for Missile Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea said today it was ready  
for negotiations over its reported plan to test-launch a long-range 
ballistic missile. 
</P>
<P>
	The conciliatory gesture came amid other indications that the  
Stalinist country is willing to resolve the issue through dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are always ready for negotiation if the hostile nations  
honestly ask for it out of an intention to alleviate our concern,'' 
a spokesman for the North Korean Foreign Ministry told its foreign 
news outlet, KCNA. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea alarmed Northeast Asia a year ago by launching what  
the United States said was a long-range ballistic missile over 
northern Japan and into the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The North now has a new missile that military analysts believe  
could reach Alaska or Hawaii. Japan, South Korea and the United 
States have said North Korea would face economic and diplomatic 
penalties if it test-launches the missile. Hard hit by food 
shortages, Pyongyang gets aid from all three countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Some U.S. and South Korean officials believe North Korea is  
using the threat of another launch to extract economic and other 
concessions in exchange for shelving the test. On Tuesday, the 
secretary of North Korea's ruling Korean Workers' Party hinted at 
that type of tradeoff.

<HEADLINE>  N. Korea Ready for Missile Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea said today it was ready  
for negotiations over its reported plan to test-launch a long-range 
ballistic missile. 
</P>
<P>
	The conciliatory gesture came amid other indications that the  
Stalinist country is willing to resolve the issue through dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are always ready for negotiation if the hostile nations  
honestly ask for it out of an intention to alleviate our concern,'' 
a spokesman for the North Korean Foreign Ministry told its foreign 
news outlet, KCNA. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea alarmed Northeast Asia a year ago by launching what  
the United States said was a long-range ballistic missile over 
northern Japan and into the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The North now has a new missile that military analysts believe  
could reach Alaska or Hawaii. Japan, South Korea and the United 
States have said North Korea would face economic and diplomatic 
penalties if it test-launches the missile. Hard hit by food 
shortages, Pyongyang gets aid from all three countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Some U.S. and South Korean officials believe North Korea is  
using the threat of another launch to extract economic and other 
concessions in exchange for shelving the test. On Tuesday, the 
secretary of North Korea's ruling Korean Workers' Party hinted at 
that type of tradeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a visitor brings us cake, we will also give cakes,'' Kim  
Yong Sun said in an interview with Cable News Network. 
</P>
<P>
	The Foreign Ministry spokesman said today that North Korea has

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vacates for 53rd Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, among the nation's oldest  
baby-boomers, is celebrating his 53rd birthday today by going on 
vacation. The White House was tightlipped about Clinton's birthday 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes it's a surprise, so maybe we should leave it at  
that,'' White House spokesman Jake Siewert said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's a safe bet that Clinton will celebrate his birthday  
during his stay on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. His friend 
Vernon Jordan threw parties for him each of the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and his family are dividing their vacation this year  
between two places: Martha's Vineyard, a family favorite, and New 
York state, a nod to Hillary Rodham Clinton's senatorial 
aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the fifth Martha's Vineyard vacation for the Clintons.  
They will spend nine days on the 20-acre Oyster Pond estate of 
developer Richard Friedman, their host for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	They are expected to be far more visible this year than last,  
when they remained indoors because Clinton's admission that he had 
an affair with Monica Lewinsky was still fresh. 
</P>
<P>
	Now though, with the Lewinsky matter ended and Mrs. Clinton's  
bid for a Senate seat from New York all but official, the president 
and first lady are making lots of plans. Already, they have 
penciled in a jaunt to Nantucket on Friday for an event with the 
American-Ireland Fund, a non-profit group that finances educational 
ventures in Northern Ireland and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund has agreed to finance projects for Vital Voices, an  
effort to foster understanding between Protestants and Catholics 
that Mrs. Clinton has been involved with in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 28, the Clintons leave the Vineyard to go to East  
Hampton, N.Y., where they will take part in a Democratic National 
Committee weekend retreat and other events to help raise money for 
Democratic candidates. On the 30th, they go to Skaneateles in 
upstate New York, returning to Washington at the start of the Labor 
Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Siewert acknowledged there were plans for the Clintons to make  
appearances during their stay in New York state, but ``on balance, 
the vacation will be a vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skaneateles, a quiet resort town of 7,500 people on Skaneateles  
Lake just southwest of Syracuse, once was a stop on the Civil 
War-era Underground Railroad that ferried slaves north to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons will stay at the lakeside home of real estate  
developer Thomas McDonald.

<HEADLINE>  Ottey Withdraws Amid Drug Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Sprinter Merlene Ottey pulled out of the  
world championships today after testing positive for a steroid 
involved in at least three other recent doping cases. 
</P>
<P>
	It was yet another blow for track and field, after Dennis  
Mitchell's two-year ban for testosterone, Javier Sotomayor's 
positive test for cocaine at the Pan-American Games and Linford 
Christie's suspension over Nandrolone, the same drug found in 
Ottey's test. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey, winner of a record 14 medals at the world championships  
including four golds, expressed shock at the result of the test 
taken after a meet July 5 in Lucerne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Jamaican runner said she was the victim of a  
``terrible mistake,'' and vowed to prove her innocence. She 
volunteered to take another test. 
</P>
<P>
	``To write this statement (of withdrawal) has been the most  
difficult and emotionally draining experience of my life,'' she 
said. ``I have lived my personal and athletic life with the utmost 
honesty and integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have applied only the highest ethical standards to myself  
and expect the same from others. I have always proclaimed fairness 
in sports and adamantly oppose the use of banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I owe it to my family, my country, my beloved sport and all my  
fans around the world to prove that this is a terrible mistake and 
that I will do everything in my power to find the truth and prove 
my innocence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey's management agency said it was contacted Sunday by a  
representative of the International Amateur Athletic Federation 
after a positive A-test sample was supposedly found in a drug test 
at an International Olympic Committee laboratory in Lausanne, 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The B sample apparently has not yet been tested.  
</P>
<P>
	IAAF general secretary, Istvan Gyulai, confirmed the report,  
saying he was informed a couple of days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a personal shock,'' Gyulai said.  
</P>
<P>
	He added that it was in the best interests of the championships,  
which begin Saturday, that Ottey withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in nobody's best interests if she comes here and runs and  
turns out positive (after the results of the B sample)'' Gyulai 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey's agent, Daniel Zimmerman, launched a strong defense of  
his client, saying,''she will fight this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can categorically state that she will defend herself,'' he  
said on BBC radio. ``I spent the last 40 hours with her. It was 
emotional and she was certain this is impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	``She went through all the possible ways this could happen and  
she has no answer. She has to get to the truth of the matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey's management group, FKG Communications, said she had not  
yet received any detailed or specific information about the test 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``based on these circumstances, Merlene Ottey has decided to  
withdraw from the upcoming IAAF World Championships in Seville,'' 
the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1979, Ottey has been tested approximately 100 times during  
her international career, and all results were negative, FKG said. 
The most recent tests at Ljubjliana May 12, 1999, and in Stockholm 
July 30, 1999, also have shown negative results, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Merlene Ottey competed every week at international  
competitions since May 29, 1999, until July 5, 1999, and was easily 
accessible for testing,'' FKG added. 
</P>
<P>
	``Merlene Ottey is planning to undergo a voluntary drug test  
under the supervision of the Jamaican Athletic Federation as soon 
as possible and intends to communicate such results to the 
public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey's positive test is the latest in a series of recent  
Nandrolone cases in track and field. Among those caught using the 
drug were Christie, the 1992 Olympic 100-meter champion; Britain's 
Doug Walker, the 1998 European 200 champion, and the Dominican 
Republic's Juana Rosario Arrendel, the Pan American Games women's 
high jump gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey, winner of 34 medals at major championships, had always  
been a silver or bronze medalist in individual events until winning 
the 200 at the 1993 World Outdoor Championships, after losing the 
100 by .001 second. She also won the 200 in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	She was ranked in the world's top 10 each year from 1980-98. She  
was undefeated in 73 consecutive finals (and 15 heats) from May 
1989 to March 8, 1991, before losing to Irina Privalova of Russia 
in the 60 meters at the World Indoor Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey's unbeaten streaks in the 100 of 57 meets, starting at the  
1987 World Championships, and in the 200 of 36 finals, starting May 
6, 1989, ended at the 1991 Worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	She was appointed a roving ambassador for Jamaica in 1993 and  
was Jamaican sportswoman of the year 15 times between 1979 and 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Herb Elliott, another Jamaican delegate at the IAAF Congress,  
first heard of Ottey's test from the media and was very upset. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a travesty of justice. In every lab, you are supposed  
to protect the interests of the athlete until the procedure has 
been completed,'' he said, referring to the B-sample. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing official yet. We know the tests are not  
completed. We have not been notified officially. The normal 
procedure is the athlete has the right to a hearing and the 
B-sample is tested. As far as we know, this has not happened yet. 
The IAAF has certain procedures and these procedures have not been 
totally fulfilled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She will withdraw because she is a proud woman. This is a  
shock for all of us. I have known her since she was 7. I have never 
known her to be on any substance.''

<HEADLINE> Protest Threatened at Arab Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Nine countries have threatened to withdraw  
from the weightlifting competitions at the Arab Games in protest 
against Qatar having four Bulgarian-born players on its team. 
</P>
<P>
	The countries have given organizers until Thursday to either  
disqualify the Bulgarians or face mass boycott, which will leave 
only Qatar and Jordan in the contests, said Azam Zoubi, president 
of the Jordan Weightlifting Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoubi told The Associated Press the protesting countries  
announced their decision 45 minutes before the start of the 
competitions Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The competitions were then put off and Prince Faisal, the head  
of the Arab Games Higher Organizing Committee, was asked to resolve 
the controversy, Zoubi said. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the latest twist to an ongoing dispute, which appeared to  
have been resolved on Tuesday when the International Weightlifting 
Federation ruled that the Bulgarians can take part in the Arab 
Games because they are now Qatari citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Arab Games rules stipulate that foreigners should have been  
citizens of a country for four years before representing it. The 
IWF also concluded that since the Bulgarians had never participated 
in international events as Bulgarian citizens, there was no 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	But the protesting countries provided documentary evidence on  
Wednesday to prove that one of the Bulgarians, Nader Sufiyan, had 
represented Bulgaria last year in Athens under a different name, 
Zoubi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sufiyan was disqualified, but the nine countries demanded that  
the other three Bulgarians be also thrown out of the competitions, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The organizers have already disqualified a Lebanese-born Qatari  
lifter because he represented Lebanon in the Asian Weightlifting 
Championship held in Thailand in December.

<HEADLINE> New NFL Stadium Draws Raves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Cleveland Browns and some of their fans got their first  
chance to see the new home of the NFL's newest team. 
</P>
<P>
	As workers continued putting finishing touches on the $283  
million, 72,000-seat Cleveland Browns Stadium on Tuesday, the team 
took the field for an afternoon practice after working out in the 
morning at their training facility in Berea, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beautiful,'' linebacker Chris Spielman said. ``I can't  
believe there's this many people here for a practice. The turf is 
great and I can't wait until we can get started for real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd estimated at 25,000 watched the team run through its  
drills for two hours. They roared as the defense jogged toward the 
famed ``Dawg Pound,'' Cleveland's rabid bleacher section of 10,000 
that was replicated and remodeled in the new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The team used the day, dubbed ``Stadium Sneak Preview'' as a dry  
run for Saturday's exhibition game against Minnesota, the first NFL 
game in Cleveland since Dec. 17, 1995, just before owner Art Modell 
took his team to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Season-ticket holders were invited to the event to check out  
their new seats. Concession stands served hot dogs, burgers and 
beers. Videos were shown on the stadium's two giant scoreboards and 
a high school marching band provided prepractice entertainment as 
if it was a football Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's gorgeous,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer said.  
``It's a monument to the city of Cleveland for what they've done, 
how they built the stadium and how they brought their team back.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *Titans    	
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Kenny Holmes will be out at least 10 days after  
undergoing arthroscopic surgery to repair a flap of cartilage in 
his left knee. Holmes played in Tennessee's 22-20 exhibition loss 
to Kansas City on Sunday after missing a few practices with the 
sore knee. The knee stiffened up Monday, and coach Jeff Fisher said 
they decided to fix the problem now rather than wait. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Colts    	
</P>
<P>
	Running back Vaughn Hebron, a member of Denver's Super Bowl  
champion teams the past two years, signed with Indianapolis after a 
morning workout, and was returning kicks during afternoon practice. 
</P>
<P>
	In six seasons, Hebron averaged 24.1 yards on 158 kickoffs and  
4.2 yards on 273 carries as well as catching 41 passes for 303 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Hebron was the backup to NFL MVP Terrell Davis last season. He  
had only 58 carries for 253 yards the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Packers    	
</P>
<P>
	Tight end Mark Chmura will miss the next two weeks while resting  
a bulging disc in his neck, but coach Ray Rhodes cautioned against 
reading too much into the Pro Bowl selection's condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to let that thing cool down,'' Rhodes said.  
``We'll reassess it when the time's right. It's too early to worry 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura has been treated with traction, ultrasound and massage.  
He has experienced periodic numbness in his upper body after 
contact drills. 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura watched practice from the sidelines Tuesday and will  
continue to do so. Both he and Rhodes expect him to be ready for 
the Sept. 12 season opener against Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Lions    	
</P>
<P>
	Rookie defensive end Jared DeVries, who injured his foot early  
in camp, is expected to be fitted for a cast. It is not known when 
he will return. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to put a cast on him for a full week and see what  
happens,'' coach Bobby Ross said. ``(If it doesn't get better), 
we'll have another step to take. I don't know what that step will 
be. We'll have to wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	Halfback Gary Brown, who underwent surgery shortly after  
training camp opened to have a painful hematoma drained from his 
buttocks, hopes to practice early next week for the first time. He 
hurt it in a motorcycle accident over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants' leading rusher with 1,063 yards last season, Brown  
has been limited to running in camp. Doctors have been afraid 
contact would cause the hematoma to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting itchy now,'' said Brown, who no longer has pain.  
``It's getting close. I'm like a caged dog who hasn't eaten in a 
year. I want to eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            *Cardinals    	
</P>
<P>
	The condition of offensive lineman Ernest Dye was upgraded to  
serious from critical after extensive surgery to repair his right 
arm produced a pulse. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye, defensive end Carl Simpson and offensive guard Lester  
Holmes were injured Monday when their car overturned as they were 
driving to a team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ernest's situation is day to day, then week to week,'' said  
Dr. Jerry Mohr, one of the surgeon's who operated on Dye for more 
than eight hours Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't known how long Dye will have to remain in the hospital.  
</P>
<P>
	Simpson was checked for pain in his hip and released. Holmes  
received a severe cut to the forehead and was released from the 
hospital on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Eagles    	
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia waived placekicker Chris Boniol and signed Norm  
Johnson to a two-year deal. Johnson, 39, is entering his 18th NFL 
season after a four-year stint with Pittsburgh. He ranks sixth on 
the NFL's career scoring list with 1,657 points. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Seahawks    	
</P>
<P>
	Starting tight end Christian Fauria will be sidelined for up to  
three weeks because of torn cartilage in his right knee, coach Mike 
Holmgren said. Fauria, who hurt the knee in Saturday's exhibition 
loss to Buffalo, is to undergo arthroscopic surgery on Wednesday. 
Itula Mili will start in Fauria's absence, with Deems May backing 
him up.

<P>
	ANDERSON, S.C. (AP ) -- Michelin North America plans to build a  
$400 million plant that will employ 400 people in northwest South 
Carolina, the governor's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Hodges and Commerce Secretary Charlie Way were to  
attend a midday announcement by the French tire manufacturer, said 
spokeswoman Nina Brook. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Tuesday, Michelin called a midday news conference at its  
North American headquarters in Greenville for a ``major 
announcement about our expansion,'' company spokesman Michael 
Fanning said. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Quoting public officials close to the negotiations, the Anderson  
Independent Mail said a site in Anderson County off U.S. Highway 29 
beat out a location in Stephens County, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's office also said that Michelin planned to  
announce a $60 million expansion in Lexington County that will 
create up to 300 jobs.

<HEADLINE> Orosco Celebrates Appearance Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Jesse Orosco has heard all the wisecracks about  
his advanced age and his seemingly simple workload. 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco, 42, is the oldest player in the Baltimore Orioles  
clubhouse. When he broke into the big leagues in 1979, teammate 
Sidney Ponson was 2 years old and Cal Ripken was playing Class A 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why some fans in opposing ballparks ask Orosco how he  
pitched to Ty Cobb, or whether he's cashed his latest Social 
Security check. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the matter of his job, which essentially requires  
no more than 10 minutes of hard work a day. Orosco usually faces no 
more than two or three batters per stint and has registered more 
games than innings over the past nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, they ask me if I'll be able to pitch tomorrow after  
going one-third of an inning,'' he said. ``But doing that has 
probably helped me. My arm might be dead now if I'd pitched two or 
three innings at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco set a major league record Tuesday night by pitching in  
his 1,072nd game, breaking the mark set last year by Dennis 
Eckersley. Orosco's nervous walk in from the bullpen probably took 
more energy than his stint on the mound, which lasted all of two 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	After Orosco disposed of Minnesota's Todd Walker to end the  
seventh inning, the Orioles showed footage of the durable reliever 
falling to his knees after recording the final out of the 1986 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene served as a reminder that Orosco has done more during  
his 20-year career than merely show up every day and face a batter 
or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco began the season with a lifetime ERA of 2.97, and while  
he struggled early this year, he has since retired 21 of 24 batters 
over his last 15 appearances. When the opposition sends up a 
left-handed slugger in the late innings, manager Ray Miller usually 
waves in Orosco from the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about Jesse is that in those 1,072 games he's  
probably warmed up twice in each one and never been on the disabled 
list,'' Miller said. ``That's not including spring training, 
postseason or anything like that. ... He's probably been up about 
3,000 times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco's most significant appearance was in the 1986 World  
Series. After a season in which he became the New York Mets' career 
saves leader, he posted three wins in the NL championship series 
and then recorded the save in Game 7 of the Series against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco later played with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Cleveland and  
Milwaukee. After compiling a 5.08 ERA with the Brewers in the 
strike-shortened 1994 season, he was afraid his career was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't know if I was going to be able to get a job.  
Then Baltimore called me just before spring training started,'' he 
said. ``To come to this wonderful ballpark, I felt like a kid 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He still feels that way.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm throwing the same speed I was 20 years ago. I feel as good  
today as I have throughout my career,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco is signed through next season with a vesting option for  
2001, so there's no telling how many games he will add to his 
pitching record. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game's always going to need a left-hander to get out the  
left-handers. That's what he does,'' teammate Mike Mussina said. 
``And he's been doing it forever.''

<HEADLINE> Ifill Said Courted by Public TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Public TV's ``Washington Week in Review'' is  
talking to NBC correspondent Gwen Ifill about hosting the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Discussions have taken place, but there's no signed  
agreement,'' Public Broadcasting Service spokesman Tom Epstein said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ifill, a political correspondent for NBC and a former  
reporter for The New York Times, has been offered the job and the 
role of chief national correspondent on the ``NewsHour with Jim 
Lehrer,'' The Washington Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	She would continue at NBC in a reduced capacity, at least for  
the short term, the Post said. Ms. Ifill has been a longtime 
panelist on ``Washington Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington Week'' fired host Ken Bode six months ago. Bode  
said it arose from a desire by the producers to put ``more edge, 
more opinion and more attitude'' on the show. At the time, WETA 
talked to Ms. Ifill about taking the job, but she rejected the idea 
out of concern for Bode, the Post said.

<HEADLINE> Baritone With Biker Look 'Genius' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With his black leather jacket, buzz cut and  
biker boots, Matthias Goerne looks ready for a night in a punk bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, at night, he sheds that garb for a dark jacket and a  
white Nehru-style shirt -- ready to sing at Carnegie Hall as one of 
the world's finest classical baritones. The 33-year-old German has 
been called a ``genius.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is true? It is true?'' he asks, laughing nervously when  
told of the word lavished upon him by The New York Times. ``I think 
it's not realistic, it's too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The truth is: Goerne is still getting used to flying the globe,  
his agile, creamy voice fueling a career that has skyrocketed in 
just a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, he performed a cycle of Schubert songs at Carnegie  
Hall with pianist Alfred Brendel. Despite his youth -- and his 
off-stage biker look -- Goerne has become a leading interpreter of 
the 19th century Romantic composer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in his manager's office near Carnegie Hall, Goerne notes  
that Schubert's tormented, seductive songs reflect his ``continuous 
search for love.'' The composer ``had a frightfully tragic life, he 
was very alone. He had friends, but he was unhappy in love ... And 
yet, he was always optimistic, always. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Schubert's music, nature is often harsh, solitary, without  
people. But even in these situations, it's still possible to love 
and be loved,'' adds the baritone, his large pale-blue eyes 
gleaming. 
</P>
<P>
	Goerne has been attracted to Schubert's songs since he was a  
child in East Germany -- a rather precocious son of a theater 
director. ``I told my parents that I would like to be a singer when 
I was maybe 8 or 9.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He laid the groundwork for his current success in his 20s with  
his first teacher, Hans Beyer. For two years, creativity came 
second to developing basic skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me, `You have to sing this way, this is right, this is  
wrong,''' says Goerne, who spent those years mostly on scales and 
exercises, learning few songs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had to figure out whether he was a tenor or a baritone.  
Because of his shimmering high notes, ``some teachers thought I 
might be a tenor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The solid technical foundation allowed him to then study with  
two of the century's finest vocal artists, baritone Dietrich 
Fischer-Dieskau and soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. 
</P>
<P>
	She taught him to darken the tone color of his upper register,  
resulting in what is now Goerne's seamless stream of sound, 
spanning 2 1/2 octaves. ``But I don't need it all,'' he says of his 
range, adding that he never pushes his physical resources to the 
limit. ``As they say, you shouldn't sing with your capital, but 
with the interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From Fischer-Dieskau and Schwarzkopf, Goerne absorbed the great  
tradition of the Romantic song, the ``lied.'' He now brings his own 
living intensity to music written almost two centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you want to interest an audience, you have to take the  
listeners with you, and you have to make the music new each time, 
rediscover it,'' he says. ``It has to exist in that moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his fluid, expressive body and round, wide-eyed face, he  
creates anew the stories of a soul yearning for an impossible love 
and an all-embracing God. He delivers them with a palette of sound 
-- from a voice that caresses words almost inaudibly to a 
penetrating vibrancy that embraces every corner of a hall. At 
moments, he seems a man possessed. 
</P>
<P>
	With each brief song, Goerne captures an emotional world sung  
intimately as if only to one person -- although he left a Carnegie 
Hall audience of about 2,000 people rapt. They then leapt to their 
feet for a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is that the Romantic era carried an unbelievably  
humanistic message, and in our time of computers and the Internet, 
we have relatively little humanism,'' he says. ``The tempo is very, 
very fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's when music is a bridge: ``The fantastic thing is that  
this musical product from the past is so great artistically that it 
is timeless. People are people, then and now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His ``product'' has popped up in a string of new recordings,  
from collections of Schubert and Robert Schumann to Hanns Eisler's 
``Hollywood Songbook.'' The Paris daily Le Monde touted the Eisler 
album as last year's classical recording of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Goerne is looking to another concert season of both recitals and  
opera: Alban Berg's fiendish drama ``Wozzeck'' in Switzerland in 
November, and appearances with such leading orchestras as the 
Berlin Philharmonic, the Vienna Philharmonic and Amsterdam's 
Concertgebouw Orchestra. And after a lauded debut at the 
Metropolitan Opera last year in Mozart's ``The Magic Flute,'' he'll 
return to New York for more recitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, music doesn't consume his life.  
</P>
<P>
	During time at home with his wife in the German countryside, he  
keeps company with local farmers and visits their barns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do nothing that's connected to my profession. I don't sing,  
I don't rehearse, I don't study, because I'm at home too little,'' 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he adds with a hearty laugh, ``I love to cook, and I  
love to drink wine -- a lot!''

<HEADLINE> Low IQs Said Linked to Thyroid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Pregnant women with underactive thyroids are four times more  
likely to have children with low IQs if the disorder is left 
untreated, researchers reported today in the New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that 19 percent of the children born to mothers  
with thyroid deficiency had IQ scores of 85 or lower, compared with 
only 5 percent of those born to mothers without such problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``These children who score in this range may face lifelong  
developmental challenges,'' said the study's lead author, Dr. James 
Haddow of the Foundation for Blood Research in Scarborough, Maine. 
``It's the kind of cutoff that tells you you're going to have more 
troubles in school and more troubles in life in general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An underactive thyroid, or hypothyroidism, can be diagnosed with  
a simple blood test and treated with a once-a-day hormone pill. 
</P>
<P>
	The thyroid gland produces a hormone that regulates the  
metabolism and is vital to brain development. Symptoms of 
hypothyroidism include tiredness, muscle weakness, cramps, 
constipation, a slow heart rate, dry and flaky skin, hair loss and 
a deep and husky voice. 
</P>
<P>
	Hypothyroidism affects between 6 million and 7 million Americans  
of all ages, but more than half of those cases are undiagnosed, 
according to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. 
</P>
<P>
	About one out of every 50 women has hypothyroidism during  
pregnancy, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors don't know exactly what causes hypothyroidism, but many  
link it to a lack of iodine, which is found in seafood, dairy 
products, bread and some table salt. 
</P>
<P>
	Untreated hypothyroidism previously had been associated with  
early miscarriages and stillbirths. In addition, thyroid disease 
can raise the risk of heart disease and worsen osteoporosis and 
infertility. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, doctors have also known that a deficiency in thyroid  
hormone in both the mother and fetus could cause developmental 
problems in the child. But researchers were not sure whether the 
child would be affected if the deficiency were found in the mother 
alone. In this study, the children had normal levels of the hormone 
as newborns. 
</P>
<P>
	Haddow and his colleagues believe widespread screening of  
pregnant mothers could help prevent retardation and other severe 
problems with brain development in their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Haddow said decreases in a child's mental abilities can result  
even when the mother's hypothyroidism is mild and she shows no 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, researchers compared 62 women with a deficiency of  
thyroid hormone to 124 women with normal levels, then studied the 
intelligence of their 7- to 9-year-old children. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors looked at the youngsters' language and reading  
abilities, school performance, visual and motor skills and ability 
to pay attention. 
</P>
<P>
	The children of the women with hormone deficiencies scored an  
average of four points lower in IQ than the other youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Robert Utiger, an  
endocrinologist and deputy editor of the journal, said iodine in 
the American diet has declined substantially in the past 15 years 
because of lower salt intake and a reduction in the amount of 
iodine added to bread and animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before routine screening for hypothyroidism in pregnant women  
is introduced, efforts should be made to increase dietary iodine 
intake by ensuring, for example, that all prenatal vitamins and, 
indeed, all vitamin products contain iodine, by increasing the 
amount of iodine added to salt, or by adding iodine to other 
foods,'' Utiger wrote.

<HEADLINE> Court Keeps Starr Probe Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A three-judge panel divided Wednesday over a  
routine go-ahead for Kenneth Starr's work, with one judge arguing 
the independent counsel's office should close because ``endless 
investigation'' doesn't serve justice. 
</P>
<P>
	But the majority in the 2-1 decision said Starr has assured the  
court ``his work is ongoing,'' including writing a final report. 
The panel issued an order allowing Starr to proceed with his 
five-year investigation of President Clinton and his wife, Hillary. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has said his office is trying to wrap up its work and  
there has been speculation he might leave office before a final 
report is filed. Starr said Wednesday his office was working with 
the Justice Department on ``whether appropriate matters can be 
referred back to the department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his dissenting opinion, appellate Judge Richard D. Cudahy of  
Chicago said, ``This is a natural and logical point for 
termination'' of the probe, with Clinton already impeached and 
acquitted on charges arising out of his affair with Monica 
Lewinsky, and no prosecutions pending against others. 
</P>
<P>
	``An endless investigation, which the passivity of the majority  
invites, can serve no possible goal of justice and imposes needless 
burdens on the taxpayers,'' wrote Cudahy, who was appointed by 
President Carter in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr issued a statement saying Cudahy's dissenting opinion  
``reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the breadth of this 
office's work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said his office is still dealing with an appeal involving  
his prosecutions related to the Whitewater real estate venture in 
which the Clintons were partners. 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted his office's responsibility for investigating the  
firing of White House Travel Office workers and the alleged misuse 
of FBI files inside the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Republican-appointed judges -- David Sentelle of  
Washington, who presides over the special panel, and Peter Fay of 
Miami-- wrote that Starr's probe should continue if only to complete 
tasks that ``would normally accompany the winding-down of an 
investigation of the present scope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The majority said the court didn't have the authority to go  
beyond asking Starr where his work stood. 
</P>
<P>
	The court considered whether Starr's probe should be terminated  
under a provision of the now-expired independent counsel law, which 
still applies to Starr. ``We have never interpreted this section to 
empower the division (of the court) to supervise independent 
counsel,'' the two judges wrote. ``Indeed, it could not 
constitutionally do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Yannett, a former Iran-Contra prosecutor, said the dissent  
is ``a remarkable development and is illustrative of the lack of 
respect that many hold the Starr office in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But St. John's University law professor John Barrett, also an  
ex-Iran-Contra prosecutor, said the court majority was properly 
cautious in limiting its role as the Constitution requires. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's staff has had theoretical discussions with Justice  
Department attorneys about how his unfinished work would be handled 
if he left, said a Justice official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department officials told Starr they probably would  
be unable to take over his unfinished investigation of the 
Clintons, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentelle, a Reagan appointee, is the only one of the three  
judges on the panel when it appointed Starr in August 1994. Fay, a 
Nixon appointee, joined the group later that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cudahy was named to special division by Supreme Court Chief  
Justice William Rehnquist in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentelle and Fay called Starr's probe ``unusually productive,  
having resulted ... in the impeachment of a president, as well as 
24 indictments and 16 convictions not alluded to by our dissenting 
colleague.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cudahy, however, contended that Starr's past record ``is quite  
irrelevant to future prospects or legitimate needs at this stage of 
the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``From the information at my disposal, I must conclude that  
there is nothing further to be done, beyond a final report, and 
certainly nothing that cannot properly be turned over to the 
Department of Justice as the statute provides,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would therefore terminate the office of this independent  
counsel subject to completion and submission of a final report.''

<HEADLINE> Paper: Wizards To Pay Richmond $40M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mitch Richmond and the Washington Wizards have  
reached agreement in principle on a $40 million deal that will make 
Richmond the highest paid shooting guard in the NBA, The Washington 
Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing sources with knowledge of the negotiations, the newspaper  
said Richmond will earn at least $40 million over four years, with 
most of the money guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there are some performance incentives in the pending  
contract that would have to be reached for Richmond to get all the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond is likely to receive $10 million in the first year of  
the contract, with annual raises of as much as 12.5 percent for the 
following three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said the deal is likely to be signed next week after  
Richmond returns from a vacation in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really happy about getting this done and getting it behind  
me,'' Richmond told the paper. ``I think if you look at what the 
team has done, there is a big upside now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost some quality players, but we also gained some quality  
in the guys we picked up. I'm glad to be in a position where I'm 
with a team that I can finish my career with. Now the goal is to 
get into the playoffs and make some noise this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond, a free agent, averaged a team-high 19.7 points for the  
Wizards last season after coming from Sacramento in the trade that 
sent Chris Webber to the Kings.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Man Convicted of Rape, Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- A man who told police he had consensual sex  
with an 88-year-old woman but had nothing to do with her death was 
convicted Wednesday of killing and raping her. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Williams Jr., 35, told police that Velma McDowell invited  
him into her apartment Feb. 18 and they had sex. He said he 
panicked afterward and placed a pair of pantyhose around her neck, 
pulling once but not killing her. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury convicted Williams of murder, rape, burglary and robbery.  
Jurors will begin deciding Thursday whether he should be sentenced 
to die or given life in prison. Prosecutors will push for the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Merle Dech said he wouldn't comment until the  
sentence is determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was staying with his mother at the apartment complex  
where Mrs. McDowell lived. Neighbors said Mrs. McDowell often left 
her door open and they saw Williams near her apartment around the 
time of the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	He shoved a rag down her throat, raped her and strangled her  
with the pantyhose, police said. He admitted taking about $300 from 
her purse to pay for a car and crack cocaine.

<HEADLINE> Panel To Study Trade Deficits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For three decades, America has been buying  
more from foreigners than it sells to them. Now come 12 Americans, 
picked by Congress, to answer the question: Do we have a problem 
here? 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's latest blue-ribbon commission, which holds its  
first public hearing Thursday, has been given the job of figuring 
out what causes trade deficits, what is their impact on the U.S. 
economy and what should be done about them. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's chairman, Murray Weidenbaum, who was head of the  
Council of Economic Advisers in the Reagan administration, says he 
believes the panel will reach a consensus in a single report rather 
than one split between the six Republican-appointed members and the 
six chosen by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We go in with a united determination that we are not going to  
issue two separate reports. That would be the easiest way out, but 
not very helpful,'' said Weidenbaum, an economist at Washington 
University in St. Louis who was named to the panel by Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	But the very existence of the U.S. Trade Deficit Review  
Commission, created by a provision in last year's budget bill, 
underscores the deep divide in American trade policy. Politicians 
often turn to study panels to handle political hot potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who won office as a centrist new Democrat,  
has seen his trade agenda stymied for more than two years by 
members of his own party who have twice turned back his efforts in 
the House to win authority to negotiate new global trade deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Republicans, normally backers of free trade because of its  
support in the business community, have seen a growing split on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination,  
conservative commentator Pat Buchanan points to the soaring trade 
deficits and says, ``America's working men and women are being 
sacrificed to the global economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the United States last enjoyed a trade surplus in goods  
and services in 1975, the deficits recently have been skyrocketing 
as the Asian economic crisis has dried up export markets for 
American manufacturers and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's deficit hit an all-time high of $164.3 billion and  
this year's deficit is running at an even higher annual rate of 
$225 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Such figures have politicians in both parties worried about a  
backlash, especially if the economic boom begins to slow and the 
unemployment level, now at a three-decade low, starts creeping back 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress has become deeply fragmented on trade policy,'' said  
Greg Mastel, an economist at the National Policy Center, a 
Washington think tank. ``The consensus that kept trade policy 
moving in the same direction since World War II has really begun to 
erode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That consensus accepted the general economic principal that all  
countries can benefit from a lowering of trade barriers through a 
process known as comparative advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Each country makes and then sells abroad what it produces best  
and buys from other nations what they produce best. Consumers 
benefit from the global competition, which drives down prices. 
While workers in noncompetitive industries lose jobs, they find new 
employment in industries benefiting from the opening of overseas 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	For America, even the existence of perennial deficits was not  
viewed as a problem because foreigners have been happy to exchange 
their products for U.S. dollars, which they invest in U.S. 
financial markets, thus pushing American stock prices higher and 
helping hold down U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But those rising trade deficits have triggered a flood of  
dollars into foreign hands, and some economists have begun to worry 
what the future might hold should foreign investors suddenly rush 
for the exits. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we keep running trade deficits of the magnitude we have  
been running, at some point it will hurt the economy,'' said 
Lawrence Chimerine, economist at the Economic Strategy Institute in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The new commission, which plans at least four hearings in cities  
around the country over the next year before issuing its report, 
brings an assortment of views to its task. Members range from 
George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers union, to Carla 
Hills, chief trade negotiator in the Bush administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Dimitri Papadimitriou, a Bard College economist and the  
commission's vice chairman, said the panel's goal is to answer 
``whether a deficit is something one needs to worry about or 
whether in a prosperous economy, things will turn out all right.''

<HEADLINE> Investigators Doubt Mercy Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- David Coughlin went camping in the New Mexico  
desert with his best friend and never made it out alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Raffi Kodikian stabbed the Massachusetts man twice in the chest,  
claiming later that the two got lost and ran out of water and that 
a dehydrated, panicky Coughlin begged to be put out of his misery. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators won't say exactly what they think happened in  
Carlsbad Caverns National Park on Aug. 7, but one thing is clear: 
They don't buy Kodikian's story. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodikian, who met Coughlin while attending school in Boston, is  
charged with murder. He returned to his family's home Sunday in 
Doylestown, Pa., after posting $50,000 bail but must return to New 
Mexico for trial. His attorney did not return calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary McCandless, chief of detectives for the Eddy County  
Sheriff's Department, said this is as unusual and puzzling as any 
case he's seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodikian, 25, and Coughlin, 26, had arrived at the park Aug. 4  
and got a two-day camping permit. Four days later, rescuers found a 
dehydrated Kodikian in a lean-to. When a ranger asked where his 
companion was, Kodikian said he had killed him to end his suffering 
and buried him in a shallow grave nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, McCandless questions whether Kodikian and  
Coughlin were hopelessly lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Their campsite was only 250 feet from the trail and a mile away  
from Coughlin's Mazda. Had they climbed to the top of the canyon 
they would have seen the park's visitors center. 
</P>
<P>
	``People actually have gotten lost there, but it didn't take  
them long to find their way out,'' McCandless said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also question Kodikian's claim that Coughlin  
suffered so much he begged to die. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy showed that Coughlin was moderately to severely  
dehydrated, which could have impaired his judgment, but Kodikian 
felt fine an hour after he was found and given food and water, 
McCandless said. Also, Kodikian was coherent when park rangers 
found him, and had enough strength to bury Coughlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were real, real thirsty and they hurt, but they weren't  
close to death,'' McCandless said. 
</P>
<P>
	The detective also said he considers the fact that Coughlin was  
stabbed twice as evidence that there was a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	The mystery has sent local, state and federal investigators in  
search of whether something happened on the young men's 
cross-country road trip to cause its tragic ending. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trek, Coughlin kept a journal in a spiral-bound  
notebook given to him by his girlfriend. With that journal in hand, 
the FBI is retracing the young men's steps -- questioning people 
they may have met, analyzing handwriting and fingerprints, even 
working with the behavioral science unit to figure out what made 
them tick. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin initiated the journey. He had quit his job as a  
management analyst with the town of Wellesley, Mass., and was 
heading to the University of California at Santa Barbara. He 
planned to get a master's degree in environmental science. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodikian, who had traveled cross-country alone after graduating  
from Northeastern University two years ago, agreed to accompany 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men were described as bright, articulate and engaging, and  
each had a streak of the romantic outdoorsman in him. 
</P>
<P>
	In a two-part free-lance series in The Boston Globe, Kodikian  
portrayed his earlier trip -- a sometimes dangerous, sometimes 
ecstatic series of encounters -- as an attempt to emulate Beat 
writer Jack Kerouac. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin, too, loved the outdoors, although his chosen medium of  
expression was photography. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men met in the 1990s when a friend introduced them while  
Kodikian attended Northeastern University and Coughlin went to the 
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 75 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	They became so close they talked to each other on the phone  
every day, according to Sandy Hobson, Coughlin's co-worker. 
Kodikian lived in Boston and Coughlin lived 20 miles away in 
Millis, but they spent a lot of time together, at movies, bars, 
skiing, biking and snowboarding. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin's girlfriend of six months, Sonnet Frost, recalled  
recently for the Milford Daily News how, before he left for the 
West Coast, she gave him the notebook with the inscription: ``While 
you're away from me, you'll be in God's hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin's family believes Kodikian's story. At a memorial  
service last week in Wellesley for Coughlin, his brother Michael 
asked mourners to pray for Kodikian.

<HEADLINE> Legal Bills Dip Into ACOG's Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games has  
written a check to the U.S. Olympic Committee for $4.6 million, 
with one more payment due in December. But outstanding lawsuits may 
shrink the final payment, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	After making the latest payment Tuesday, the committee had $7  
million in a contingency fund set aside to pay the USOC, which was 
ACOG's joint marketing partner for the 1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC, which funds the training and living expenses of  
potential Olympic athletes, has said it is content to receive 
whatever money is left from the Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the $7 million contingency fund may be  
reduced by legal fees and accounting fees, which last year totaled 
$581,402, and by pending lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee is engaged in a legal battle over whether Olympic  
records are subject to Georgia open records laws. Two other 
lawsuits still pending against ACOG involve a property dispute and 
a lost painting. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax returns obtained by the newspaper indicate ACOG spent $8.8  
million last year, primarily to complete the conversion of the 
Olympic Stadium to Turner Field, to demolish Atlanta-Fulton County 
Stadium and to build a parking lot for the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues in 1998 totaled $1.4 million, including $791,290 from  
interest earned on cash investments and $550,521 from a final 
settlement on the commemorative Olympic coin program.

<HEADLINE> Woman Convicted of Murdering 4 Sons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- A woman who shot her four sons to death and  
blamed it on drugs, alcohol and bad relationships has been 
convicted of murder and now faces the possibility of a death 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors will return next week to consider whether Susan Eubanks,  
35, should get the death penalty or life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Eubanks shot her sons, ages 4 to 14, after an argument with  
her boyfriend in October 1997. She stopped once to reload the 
.38-caliber revolver and then shot herself in the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	She was convicted Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Bill Rafael claimed his client -- an unemployed,  
debt-burdened nursing assistant -- was a good mother until 
work-related injuries led to her addiction to pain killers. She 
also began drinking to kill the emotional pain caused by bad 
relationships with men, Rafael said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued that Ms. Eubanks deliberately plotted to kill  
the children to torment her boyfriend and the boys' fathers -- her 
two ex-husbands. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Eubanks, the father of the three youngest boys, testified  
he was concerned after receiving a cryptic message on his answering 
machine from Ms. Eubanks that said: ``Say good-bye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day of the killings, Ms. Eubanks' boyfriend, Rene Dobson,  
called police and asked deputies to accompany him to her home. The 
two had been drinking all day and argued, and she took away his car 
keys and slashed his tires. 
</P>
<P>
	Eubanks stopped by during that time, and Dobson said he told the  
father, ``She's a little whacked and I want you to know that's 
she's talked about killing herself and the boys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Less than three hours later, deputies found 14-year-old Brandon  
Armstrong shot twice in the head, laying face-down on the living 
room floor, his half-eaten cereal spilled around him. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bedroom, his 7-year-old brother, Austin, was found sitting  
upright on the top level of his bunk bed, dead from two shots to 
the head. Two younger brothers, 6-year-old Brigham and 4-year-old 
Matthew, were on the bottom bunk, also with gunshot wounds to the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bedroom, deputies found Ms. Eubanks crying and clutching a  
bloody towel to her stomach.

<TEXT>
<P>
	MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) -- A 10-year-old boy spent a night in the  
hospital after being attacked by a shark just off the Grand Strand, 
a popular beach area packed with thousands of summer tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack Monday prompted the beach patrol to evacuate swimmers  
along about three miles of coastline. 
</P>
<P>
	Police on Tuesday confirmed that it was a shark that had bitten  
Christopher Handley of Richmond, Va., on the head and back. They 
did not know what type of shark attacked him. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was released from Grand Strand Regional Medical Center  
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharks are not uncommon in the ocean off South Carolina, but  
attacks on humans along the popular beaches are rare. An Alabama 
man visiting Myrtle Beach was bitten in the leg by a shark in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Indians DL Langston, Add 2 Pitchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Mark Langston was placed on the 15-day disabled  
list Wednesday as the Cleveland Indians made roster moves involving 
four pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Langston was put on the DL for the second time this season after  
pulling his left quadriceps on the last pitch of a rough first 
inning Tuesday night. He gave up six runs and six hits in a 15-4 
loss to the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians also optioned left-hander Tom Martin to Triple-A  
Buffalo, purchased left-hander Chris Haney from Buffalo and 
recalled right-hander Jason Rakers from their top minor league 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin had a 9.00 ERA in six innings since being activated from  
the 60-day DL on Aug. 9. He had been rehabilitating from shoulder 
surgery in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom was not sent down because he was hurt or because he has  
pitched bad,'' manager Mike Hargrove said. ``He was sent down 
because our bullpen is fried. We needed two fresh arms.''

	That was down from $266 million, or 27 cents a share, in the  
same period in 1998, and below Wall Street forecasts for a 
per-share profit of 24 cents a share, according to an analyst 
survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results do not reflect spending related to the  
transition to digital set-top boxes by the satellite television 
service BSkyB, expenses that left News Corp. with a net loss $224 
million in the fourth quarter. The year-ago quarterly results also 
exclude certain one-time factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the just-ended quarter totaled $3.3 billion, edging  
higher from $3.2 billion in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	For its full fiscal year, News Corp. posted an operating profit  
of $917 million, or 92 cents per share, a drop of 25 percent from 
the prior fiscal year's $1.22 billion, or $1.26 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the 12 months ended June 30 totaled $13.6 billion,  
up 6 percent from $12.8 billion in the prior fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	News Corp. said a strong showing by its movie, TV stations and  
magazine insert operations were offset by lower profits at Fox 
Broadcasting Network, losses at Fox News Channel, and the loss of 
earnings from TV Guide, which was sold in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding TV Guide and other businesses sold, operating income  
for both the year and fourth quarter were almost even with 
year-earlier levels. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Fox Entertainment Group, which was partially spun off  
last year through an initial public offering of stock, 
fourth-quarter income totaled $35 million, or 5 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a sharp improvement from the $3 million, or 1 cent a  
share reported in the same period last year, but slightly shy of 
the per-share profit of 6 cents expected by most Wall Street 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's earnings before taxes, depreciation and amortization  
-- a popular measure of a company's performance -- totaled $246 
million in the latest quarter, up 30 percent from an ``EBITDA'' of 
$189 million in the fourth quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Entertainment's fourth-quarter revenues rose 12 percent to  
$2.00 billion compared with $1.80 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said revenues grew 10 percent or better in all  
business segments, producing stronger results from movie 
operations, television stations and the Fox News Channel. However, 
higher costs for sports and prime-time programming resulted in a 
lower profit contribution from Fox's broadcasting operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie segment finished the fiscal year strongly with the  
release of ``Never Been Kissed,'' ``Entrapment'' and the much 
anticipated ``Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace,'' which has 
already generated $416 million in domestic receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	For the fiscal year, Fox Entertainment's net income totaled $205  
million, or 33 cents per share, an improvement of 16 percent from 
$176 million, or 32 cents per share, in the prior 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-year revenues rose to $8.1 billion, a 15 percent increase  
over the prior year's $7.0 billion. EBITDA rose 14 percent to 
$1.031 billion compared with $906 million a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Bush Won't Answer Drug Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush testily refused to answer  
questions Wednesday about whether he had ever used illegal drugs. 
Rumors about his personal life, he said, are ``ridiculous and 
absurd,'' possibly planted by political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what happens? Somebody floats a rumor and that causes  
you to ask a question,'' Bush said, interrupting a reporter who 
said she was trying to ask who might be planting such rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that's the game in American politics, and I refuse to play  
it,'' he said. ``That is a game. And you just fell for the trap. 
And I refuse to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since his first campaign for Texas governor in 1994, Bush has  
declined to answer some questions about his past. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was young and irresponsible, I behaved young and  
irresponsibly,'' is his oft-repeated answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's refusal to directly answer the drug question has become  
the fodder for jokes on late-night television. It continued to dog 
him as he campaigned later Wednesday in Baton Rouge, La. ``I made 
some mistakes years ago,'' he said. ``But I learned from my 
mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said that, upon turning 40, he quit drinking alcohol.  
And in the wake of the President Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal, 
Bush has said he's been faithful to his wife of more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But since launching his presidential bid, Bush has steered clear  
of the drug question, saying he believes voters are weary of what 
he called ``the politics of personal destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign says the governor believes there is a line to  
be drawn between legitimate questions about his record and some 
other inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Important facts that people deserve to know about are how he's  
fulfilled his duties as governor, father, husband and employer. 
Those are relevant questions,'' said Bush spokesman Scott 
McClellan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is going to take this on and say 'enough is enough.' If  
that leads to mistaken assumptions about his past, that's fine with 
him. He's not going to itemize for the children of America and his 
daughters, who are watching, everything he did or did not do in the 
past,'' McClellan said. 
</P>
<P>
	During Wednesday's exchange, Bush did not say who he thought was  
planting rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I think they're being planted? I know they're being  
planted. And they're ridiculous and they're absurd and the people 
of America are sick and tired of this kind of politics. And I'm not 
participating,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether his campaign earlier had pointed to the campaign  
of millionaire publisher Steve Forbes as a source of rumors, Bush 
replied, ``I don't remember, I don't remember that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' political director, Bill Dal Col, said the campaign  
``never made the accusation, and no we don't get involved in the 
rumor game.'' Asked whether Forbes ever used illegal drugs, Dal Col 
said, ``No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, while seeking the White House in 1992, also faced  
questions about drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in England I experimented with marijuana a time or  
two and didn't like it,'' Clinton said. ``I didn't inhale and I 
didn't try it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Clinton's first direct public acknowledgment that he ever  
tried illegal drugs. Before that, he'd always responded to 
questions about drug use by saying that he never violated state or 
federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an opinion poll taken earlier this year, Americans  
are about evenly divided on the question of whether the public 
needs to know about a candidate's drug use in the past. Just over 
half said ``yes'' in the February CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential rival John McCain says he has not used  
illegal drugs. As to whether Bush or other candidates should answer 
questions about any drug use in their past, McCain spokesman Howard 
Opinsky said, ``The question about what is appropriate or not is 
going to be made by the media and the voters. He realizes it is 
part of running for office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, who also is seeking the GOP nomination, said Sunday  
on CNN: ``We ought to be able to say with no hesitation that 'No, 
we have not broken the drug laws of the United States,' and 'No we 
have not used cocaine.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Comedians have capitalized on Bush's refusal to answer the drug  
question. 
</P>
<P>
	An Aug. 11 monologue on ``The Tonight Show'': ``Bush has come  
under fire lately for not answering questions about possible 
cocaine use. Well, today, he came out for mandatory drug testing. 
He says he is for it. In fact, he said, 'Look, whatever drugs 
you've got, bring them by. I will test them.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, former Gov. Ann Richards, whom Bush ousted in 1994,  
faced drug use questions from a Democratic primary election rival 
when she first sought the party's nomination in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	A recovering alcoholic, Richards openly discussed her drinking  
and her recovery, but she refused to answer questions about 
possible drug use. She won the primary, and GOP candidate Clayton 
Williams didn't raise the drug issue. Neither did Bush four years 
later.

<HEADLINE> Smith Decides Against Taxpayer Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) -- In the latest twist to his maverick  
presidential campaign, U.S. Sen. Bob Smith reversed course 
Wednesday and said he would not seek the nomination of the U.S. 
Taxpayers Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a second-term senator from New Hampshire, resigned from  
the Republican Party last month, saying it had abandoned its 
conservative base. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he announced last week he would seek the presidential  
nomination of the Taxpayers Party during its convention next month 
and called on conservatives to ``come home'' to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	But at a political breakfast Wednesday, Smith said his wife,  
Mary Jo, had checked into Catholic Medical Center with chest and 
arm pains Tuesday, and he hinted he might drop out of the running 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have a presidential campaign. At the moment, I haven't  
made a decision today,'' he said. ``Right now, I'm focused on my 
family situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would make a decision within a few days about whether  
to continue his presidential campaign. ``I'm an independent, and 
I'm enjoying it, frankly. I feel free,'' he told about 150 business 
leaders at ``Politics and Eggs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers Party founder Howard Phillips said Smith had been  
uncertain about his intention for some weeks. ``I think one 
increasing concern the senator had was increasing talk of Pat 
Buchanan seeking the Reform Party nomination,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith spokeswoman Karen Hickey said Buchanan had nothing to  
do with Smith's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, that's not true at all,'' she said. She also said Smith  
did not make his decision until late Tuesday, after his wife's 
admission to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was expected to win the Taxpayers Party nomination easily  
if he committed himself to its platform and other candidates, 
Phillips said. He said Smith also had agreed to stay in the entire 
race once he accepted the nomination.

<HEADLINE>  Mutiny 1, Revolution 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Ritchie Kotschau's first-half goal  
Wednesday night gave the Tampa Bay Mutiny a 1-0 victory over the 
New England Revolution . 
</P>
<P>
	The 43rd-minute goal, the defender's first of the year, lifted  
Tampa to its first win at Foxboro in nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mutiny snapped a two-game losing streak, improved to 10-14  
and moved into a third-place tie with Miami, four points ahead of 
New England (8-14). 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolution -- with two games in hand on Tampa and one on  
Miami -- have lost six straight. 
</P>
<P>
	The top four teams in each conference qualify for the playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
	The game was played before 13,087, the smallest crowd of the  
year at Foxboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams had chances in the opening half, but it was Tampa  
that made the most of its opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Valderama passed to Raul Diaz Arce, who pushed the ball  
back to Dominic Kinnear on the right side, where he swung a cross 
to Kotschau. 
</P>
<P>
	Kotschau, who made a number of dangerous overlapping runs in the  
game from his left back position, rose above New England's Mike 
Burns and put the ball into the far right side of the net with a 
perfectly timed header about two yards from the left post. 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolution tried in vain to tie it in the second half. Ivan  
McKinley headed a cross by Leonel Alvarez from 12 yards out over 
the crossbar at 86 minutes. A minute earlier, Joe-Max Moore's 
direct kick from 20 yards deflected off a Tampa defender before it 
went wide to the right. In the 76th minute, a well-struck 22-yard 
shot by Burns went wide to the right. 
</P>
<P>
	The match marked the Revolution debut of midfielders Alvarez and  
Jeff Baicher who joined the team Friday.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Accuses U S West of Bad Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. filed complaints against U S West Inc.  
with regulators in five states Wednesday, alleging the Baby Bell is 
ignoring telephone customers to steal a bigger share of the 
high-stakes multimedia market. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has built a nationwide communications network by acquiring  
or partnering with four of the country's biggest cable TV 
companies, including the MediaOne Group Inc. Several consumer 
groups have urged federal regulators to require AT&AMP;T to open its 
cable lines to other companies to offer Internet and other services 
or reject the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, U S West is merging with Denver neighbor Qwest  
Communications International Inc. The new company would be a major 
rival to AT&AMP;T in providing telephone, Internet and cable services. 
</P>
<P>
	Against this backdrop, AT&AMP;T and U S West spent Wednesday lobbing  
barbs at one another after AT&AMP;T filed complaints with regulators in 
Colorado, Arizona, Minnesota, New Mexico and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``U S West provides its customers with the poorest service in  
the country and it's rapidly getting worse,'' said Frank Ianna, 
AT&AMP;T's network services president. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T also accused U S West deliberately failing to adequately  
invest in its facilities; refusing to build needed facilities; and 
favoring itself and its affiliates when it does invest in the 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West ``has made it impossible for AT&AMP;T to provide timely,  
quality services to many customers ...,'' Ianna said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Smith, U S West vice president for Colorado, denied the  
charges. ``(AT&AMP;T) provides worse service to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said U S West completes requested work for AT&AMP;T on time 80 to  
94 percent of the time while its competitor meets deadlines only 28 
percent of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints were simply a case of AT&AMP;T simply running scared,  
he added. ``AT&AMP;T is well aware of the fact that Qwest's data and 
long distance network around the world is bigger than theirs and 
more modern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the main reason why these complaints were filed, said Rex  
G. Mitchell, an analyst with Bank America Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has very little to do with service levels in U S West  
territory and a whole lot to do with competition in the local 
market and the long distance market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said AT&AMP;T is hoping its complaints about U S West service  
will convince regulators to approve its merger with MediaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	``The complaint may have merit but their motivation'' is winning  
approval of MediaOne and blocking U S West-Qwest from becoming a 
competitor for long distance. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said regulators will understand what is going on ``but  
consumers may not. If AT&AMP;T can convince consumers, regulators will 
vote with consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U S West is the primary provider of local telephone service in a  
14-state area of the Midwest and West. It is required to provide 
timely access to its network for competitors who want to offer 
local service. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said it does nearly $1 billion business with U S West, and  
is the Baby Bell's largest access customer. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators in several states served by U S West have been  
critical of the company in recent years because of complaints about 
delays in filling new service and repair orders. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West officials have said they are working to improve  
service, but were hampered last year by a labor strike and weather 
problems in several states. They also say the big demand for second 
phone lines for faxes and Internet service could not have been 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, a J.D. Power and Associates survey concluded  
that U S West was on a par with Southwestern Bell and two other 
regional phone companies in a customer satisfaction survey. 
</P>
<P>
	It also found that 51 percent of U S West customers polled said  
they would possibly switch service if offered a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey came after the Colorado Public Utilities Commission  
decided to review U S West's performance because of complaints 
about deteriorating telephone service. That case could result in 
fines or customer refunds for U S West.

<HEADLINE> Feds Bust Drug Network in 14 Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Omar Rocha Soto lived in a $649,000 home with  
an immaculately landscaped lawn, a father of three with no known 
criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
	But federal authorities say there's a dark side. The 37-year-old  
Rocha, a Mexican national living illegally in the United States, 
was arrested Tuesday and labeled by authorities as a key figure in 
one of the nation's top drug distribution networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Operation Southwest Express also led to the arrests of 70 other  
people in 14 cities. The organization allegedly imported tons of 
cocaine and marijuana into the Southwest and distributed it to the 
Midwest and East. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 28 more arrests were expected.  
</P>
<P>
	During the yearlong investigation, agents seized more than two  
tons of marijuana, nearly three tons of cocaine, luxury cars, 
weapons and more than $1.15 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization ``embraced the American capitalist idea and  
would sell any type of drug for a profit,'' Assistant FBI Director 
Thomas Pickard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities say Rocha coordinated the smuggling of  
cocaine and marijuana from Mexico to El Paso, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs, which originated in Mexico, South America and  
Southeast Asia, were then shipped to Chicago and on to Cleveland, 
New York, Boston, Nashville, Tenn., and Atlanta, Pickard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocha's alleged vocation was news to his neighbors in the  
upscale Rancho Bernardo community, an exclusive development with 
wide, gently sloping streets where some ride golf carts from their 
driveways to a nearby country club. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't suspect at all. I'm really shocked,'' neighbor Amy  
Kaneshiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one answered the door Tuesday at the house, a  
Mediterranean-style home on a hill, or at the servant's quarters in 
the back yard. A new Dodge pickup was parked in the driveway, with 
two packages of chocolate Easter candy melting on the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocha and his wife, Adriana Espinoza Rocha, a U.S. citizen,  
bought the house 18 months ago for $649,000, with a $452,000 
mortgage, said William Gore, special agent in charge of the San 
Diego office of the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents swarmed the house at 5 a.m. Tuesday, arresting Mrs. Rocha  
and putting the couple's three young children in protective 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Six others at the house, including a gardener and maid, were  
taken into custody by the Immigration and Naturalization Service as 
suspected illegal immigrants, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the home, agents found $10,000 in cash and a .25-caliber  
handgun, but no drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocha had been arrested four hours earlier while driving south  
toward downtown San Diego. Agents feared he might be fleeing to 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Rocha and his wife were jailed in San Diego pending a court  
hearing today on charges of drug trafficking, money laundering and 
conspiracy. The trafficking charges alone can carry 20-year prison 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Also arrested Tuesday as part of the investigation were three  
brothers -- Daniel, Raul and Angel Sotello-Lopez -- who agents said 
coordinated transportation for the group from their El Paso base.

<HEADLINE> European Share Prices Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European shares closed mostly lower Wednesday,  
with chemical and resources stocks leading the decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said European equity prices had been depressed by the  
lack of support from U.S. equity and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Market watchers pointed to the yen, which surged to a fresh  
six-month high against the dollar and a record high against the 
euro Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more dangerous issue is the dollar,'' said George Hodgson,  
pan-European equity strategist at ABN Amro in London. ``If the 
dollar continues to come under pressure, then U.S. equities will 
suffer. In light of that, we have a wary view on the second half 
for European equities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies closed down  
0.09 points at 306.19. The biggest decliners were basic resources 
and chemicals; those indexes dropped 1.4 percent and 1.2 percent 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Mining stocks in London were hit by heavy selling for the third  
straight day, after the sector enjoyed a substantial rally last

<HEADLINE> Catfish Hunter's Condition Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Doctors upgraded the condition of Hall  
of Fame pitcher Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter to serious from critical 
Wednesday and said he continued to make slow progress from a head 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I visit him, he is a little more alert,'' said his  
wife, Helen Hunter, in a statement released by the Hunter's 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our family is hopefully optimistic that Jimmy is well on the  
road to recovery. We continue to be encouraged and uplifted by the 
concern and prayers of so many people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hunter said she believed prayer would be the key to her  
husband's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Well-wishers have sent hundreds of cards to Hunter, including  
some 100 that were delivered Tuesday to Pitt County Memorial 
Hospital neurological intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter began some physical rehabilitation on Tuesday at the  
hospital 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old Hunter fell and hit his head Aug. 8 on concrete  
steps at his home in Hertford. He was unconscious for several days, 
but awoke and began responding to commands. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, who retired in 1979 to his northeastern North Carolina  
farm after 15 years in the majors and five World Series rings, was 
diagnosed last year with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The 
condition, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a gradual, 
irreversible deterioration of the muscles.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Rise Again / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose for a fourth straight session  
on Wednesday, driving yields briefly below 6 percent for the first 
time in a month, as traders grew confident the Federal Reserve will 
only need one more interest rate hike this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 5/32 point, or  
$1.56 1/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, fell to 6.00 percent from 6.01 percent late 
Tuesday. Wednesday's yield officially fell to 5.996, but it is 
rounded up to 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a week ago, the 30-year bond yields had moved to 6.27.  
</P>
<P>
	The optimism about interest rates comes a day after the Labor  
Department released a report showing the Consumer Price Index rose 
a moderate 0.3 percent in July, a sign inflation is under control. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed is expected to raise interest rates a quarter point at  
its meeting next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders don't like higher interest rates because they make  
fixed-rate investments like bonds less attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader secondary market, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities were up 2/32 point, and intermediate maturities ranged 
1/16 point to 3/32 point higher, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.74 percent with a  
discount of 4.62 percent, down 0.06 percentage point from late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields were 5.04 percent while the discount was 4.85  
percent, down 0.06 percentage point from late Monday. One-year 
yields were 5.15 percent with a discount of 4.89 percent, down 0.04 
percentage point from Tuesday's Treasury auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.87 1/2 percent from 4.93 3/4 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 5/32 point to 113 5/32. The average 
yield to maturity was 5.85 percent, down from 5.86 percent.

<HEADLINE> Annual Pa. Pigeon Shoot Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A pigeon shoot that animal-rights  
activists have protested for years has been canceled by organizers 
who cited a recent Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling that allows 
activists to try to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Tobash of the Labor Day Committee Inc., which has  
sponsored the fund-raising event for 65 years, said Tuesday he does 
not want activists dictating how he runs the Hegins pigeon shoot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not give one person from Philadelphia the opportunity  
to enforce his private version of the Pennsylvania animal cruelty 
laws, which, for the past 100 years, have been interpreted to allow 
the shooting of pigeons,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each Labor Day since 1933, thousands of birds have been released  
at Hegins Community Park in Schuylkill County as targets for as 
many as 200 people who pay to shoot. Last year's fee was $75. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of the birds die immediately from their wounds, and  
hundreds more die outside the fenced-in, 35-foot circle designated 
for the shoot. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court ruled three weeks ago that an agent of the  
Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals had 
the authority to seek a court order blocking the pigeon shoot. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobash said he did not know whether he would end the shoot  
entirely or just cancel it for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our primary purpose is not to shoot pigeons,'' he said. ``It's  
to raise money'' for the park and other civic groups.

<HEADLINE> Tripp Seeks Indictment Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Linda Tripp has asked a judge to dismiss her  
felony wiretapping indictment, arguing state prosecutors improperly 
relied on her immunized testimony about Monica Lewinsky's affair 
with President Clinton during their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In motions filed Tuesday, Mrs. Tripp's lawyer, Joseph Murtha,  
argued state prosecutors cannot prove that she illegally taped the 
former White House intern without using her federal testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``The source of the information utilized by the State could only  
have been obtained as a result of information directly or 
indirectly derived from the federal grand jury proceeding,'' Murtha 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli denied that his office  
used information gathered by federal sources. 
</P>
<P>
	No judge has been assigned to hear the motions and no court date  
has been set, meaning trial will likely be scheduled no earlier 
than this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury indicted Mrs. Tripp on July 30 on two felony counts  
charging that she illegally tape-recorded Ms. Lewinsky and 
disclosed the contents of the conversation to Newsweek magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp secretly taped Ms. Lewinsky numerous times and gave  
the tapes to independent counsel Kenneth Starr under an agreement 
that protected her grand jury testimony and provided immunity from 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	The information helped lead to the impeachment of President  
Clinton in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp admitted to a federal grand jury that she eventually  
learned that taping conversations without the other person's 
consent is illegal in Maryland, but continued to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed to protect myself,'' she testified.  
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Mrs. Tripp could be sentenced to five years in  
prison and fined $10,000 for each of the two counts.

<HEADLINE> Spartans Coach Gets Pay Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Tom Izzo has been rewarded by  
Michigan State with contract revisions that will raise his salary 
to coach the basketball team to at least $725,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an elite program with an elite coach,'' said Terry  
Denbow, vice president for university relations. He said the 
contract was approved by university president Peter McPherson, who 
was traveling in Turkey but unhurt in Tuesday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a recognition of past performance and excellence and  
of shared expectations,'' Denbow said. ``And a consideration of 
market forces in that profession. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do see this as a win-win situation. The incentive is  
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Izzo led the Spartans to their second straight Big Ten  
championship and a berth in the NCAA Final Four last season. He 
earned national Coach of the Year honors two seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ecstatic about the contract,'' Izzo told the Lansing State  
Journal. ``The administration has been very fair to me. And it's 
only a good deal if both sides feel good about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denbow said the new contract was justified.  
</P>
<P>
	``Say what you will, your identity and your image as an  
institution is affected by winning and losing programs,'' Denbow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that additional revenue from fund-raising and licensing,  
plus exposure generated by 21 nationally televised games, made 
Izzo's contract a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Izzo's pay remains lower than some other Big Ten coaches, such  
as Indiana coach Bob Knight and Purdue coach Gene Keady, who both 
reportedly make over 1 million, the State Journal reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is I'm happy with mine,'' Izzo said. ``If there are  
four coaches ahead of me, that's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Izzo reaches seven incentive goals for his team's success on  
the court and in the classroom, he can earn an additional $195,000. 
And if he's still the head coach on July 1, 2004, he will get a 
$500,000 bonus, repeated every five years thereafter.

<HEADLINE> Washington State Receiver Gets Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -- Washington State wide receiver and  
co-captain Nian Taylor has been sentenced to three days in the 
Whitman County jail and two years probation after pleading guilty 
to charges of malicious mischief. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor was accused of grabbing his ex-girlfriend and punching  
her in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor originally was sentenced to a year in jail in the June  
incident but Superior Court Judge Wallace Friel on Tuesday 
suspended 362 days of the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely believe that this is fair,'' county prosecuting  
attorney Toby Crowell said. ``We recommended a week in jail. But he 
already spent one night in jail the night he was arrested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor was ordered to undergo domestic violence counseling and  
pay $511 in damages, plus court costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor wasn't at practice Tuesday because of the court hearing.  
Coach Mike Price said Taylor ``has been punished already by the 
football department. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was suspended for a month in the summer, he couldn't go to  
the weight room, which is like death for these guys, or be a part 
of the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price said he isn't sure when Taylor will serve his jail time.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Blames Self for Colo. Spree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- The teen-ager facing trial in the shootings  
at Springfield's Thurston High School believed he was an 
embarrassment to his parents because they expected him to be 
perfect. He also blamed himself for the Columbine High School 
shootings, according to new records filed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Kip Kinkel's statements to a defense psychiatrist also touched  
on his thoughts of suicide after the slayings of his parents on May 
20, 1998, the day before the school shootings that left two dead 
and 22 wounded, according to a sworn statement by Lane County 
Deputy District Attorney Kent Mortimore. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's statements were excerpted by Mortimore from a 45-page  
report prepared by Dr. Orin Bolstad, a psychiatrist who will 
testify for the defense at Kinkel's Sept. 27 trial. The excerpts 
were made public in court documents Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel, 15 at the time of the shootings, has been in the Lane  
County Jail since his 16th birthday. He is charged with 58 counts, 
including four counts of aggravated murder. 
</P>
<P>
	In the documents, Bolstad asked Kinkel about his relationship  
with his parents, Bill and Faith Kinkel. ``I had to be 100 
percent,'' Kinkel said. ``No one is perfect, though. Lots of times, 
life sucked. With my parents, if I didn't do the best, I was an 
embarrassment to my parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Concerning the Thurston shootings, Kinkel told Bolstad, ``I knew  
people would be in cafeteria. Just started shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the documents, Kinkel also told Bolstad that when  
he learned of the April shootings in Littleton, Colo., ``I flipped 
out. Started blaming myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mortimore referred to Kinkel's statements in legal arguments  
over the prosecution's attempt to retain noted forensic 
psychiatrist Dr. Park Dietz. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortimore indicated in the documents that the Kinkel excerpts  
were intended to give the judge a sample of the kind of information 
Dietz, who has taken part in the cases of John Hinckley, Jeffrey 
Dahmer and others, has reviewed in preparing to examine Kinkel for 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel's lawyers claim they discussed Kinkel's case ``in some  
detail'' with Dietz's staff and that the law doesn't allow Dietz to 
now work for the prosecution. In sworn statements to the court, 
however, Dietz and two staff members denied discussing Kinkel's 
case with defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane County Circuit Judge Jack Mattison is expected to rule  
Thursday on whether Dietz may testify for the prosecution.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Renews Emphasis on Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steve Forbes is entering a new stage of his  
campaign with a familiar strategy: Talk about weighty issues, 
accuse presidential rivals of running ``content-free campaigns'' 
and prepare to go negative when the time is right. 
</P>
<P>
	After finishing second Saturday to Texas Gov. George W. Bush in  
Iowa's straw poll, Forbes believes that by hammering issues in the 
fall, he can make the Republican front-runner appear shallow and 
overmatched. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, who finished one place behind Forbes, is in for  
similar treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to turn up the decibel level on issues, because  
that is where Bush and Dole are most vulnerable,'' Forbes media 
adviser Greg Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes begins a book tour this week to promote ``A New Birth of  
Freedom,'' a 186-page book that outlines his views on taxes, health 
care, Social Security, the environment and education -- all with an 
overarching argument that Americans would be more free with less 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	He accepted an invitation to debate Bush at The Oxford Union in  
England, then needled Bush for not following suit. 
</P>
<P>
	A new fund-raiser letter from the Forbes camp says the Iowa  
straw poll showed that voters desire an ``issues candidate.'' 
Though he finished well behind Bush in the Iowa contest, Forbes 
fared better than he does in polls -- evidence, aides say, that 
voters rally to the millionaire publisher when they get a long 
look. 
</P>
<P>
	And he plans to accelerate the pace of his ad campaign to  
highlight his commitment to issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes spent $10 million this summer on a series of television  
and radio ads, many of which promised action on taxes and Social 
Security. He has increased his budget for a new set of issues ads 
this fall, but Forbes said Thursday the spots will not mention Dole 
or Bush -- even by inference. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, blasted in 1996 for airing critical ads against eventual  
nominee Bob Dole, may be preparing for similar tactics beyond the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign said Wednesday that supporters had received  
calls from Forbes pollsters who appeared to be testing negative 
themes. One of the Bush backers, Sharice Schwarm, said the caller 
asked if she would change her mind about supporting Bush if she 
knew ``that he'd send troops to Taiwan.'' The caller also asked 
about a Texas funeral home agency controversy involving the 
governor, Schwarm said. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the Forbes campaign did not deny that polling is  
being done to gauge any Bush weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continuously poll. We poll all our political opponents and  
we poll on issues. But we don't talk about our questions,'' said 
political director Bill Dal Col. ``If our opponent is paranoid 
enough or weak enough, they'll have to figure that out. If they're 
feeling a little paranoid, it's probably because of their 
less-than-stellar showing Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker: ``Republicans wants a  
positive, optimistic and hopeful campaign that details a vision for 
the future. The don't want -- and will reject -- the old-style, 
trashmouth politics of ugly attack ads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has always considered himself an issues-driven candidate,  
but he is increasing his focus on policy to shame Bush into 
discussing politically difficult issues -- or to criticize him for 
not taking the bait. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other campaigns are going to have to start putting some  
things on the table,'' Forbes said in a telephone interview 
Wednesday. ``They're going to realize that content-free campaigns 
mean victory for Steve Forbes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to Bush and Dole say their candidates have discussed  
issues, and plan to unveil more proposals in the fall. Bush has 
given a major policy speech on the role of religious institutions 
in government. Dole has offered gun control measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been vociferous on issues ... while at the same time  
reserving detailed discussion of the major issues -- education, 
crime, drugs and taxes -- for the fall when millions of people are 
paying attention instead of a few columnists,'' said Dole spokesman 
Ari Fleischer. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican operatives are unsure how much mileage Forbes will  
gain from the strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody cares about issues. The reason they don't care right  
now is it's too soon to care. They're not paying attention -- and 
they shouldn't,'' said Joe Gaylord, a longtime GOP strategist. 
``It's August in a non-election year, for crying out loud.''

<HEADLINE> Gary Coleman Files for Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former ``Diff'rent Strokes'' star Gary  
Coleman has filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, who once earned $70,000 an episode on the sitcom,  
blamed financial woes on his lifelong kidney problems, 
mismanagement of his money and settlement of a 1993 lawsuit over 
his earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is not a day to focus on the past, but rather to look  
forward to a productive, happy and constructive future,'' Coleman 
said Wednesday outside federal court, where he filed for bankruptcy 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, 30, last month paid a $400 fine for punching  
autograph-seeker Tracy Fields. Coleman, who was working as a 
security guard, pleaded no contest in February to disturbing the 
peace. He also was ordered to attend anger management classes. 
</P>
<P>

1978 to 1986.

<HEADLINE> Ball's Thoughts on Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Thoughts on the nation's retirement system from one of Social  
Security's pioneers, Robert M. Ball, who ran the program from 1962 
to 1973 and remains active in the debate over its future: 
</P>
<P>
	--''Social Security is our family protection plan. The very basic  
amount of money that Social Security provides for retirees, for 
totally disabled people, for families facing the death of a wage 
earner, that really basic amount I think ought to be very secure. 
You couldn't depend on the benefit if you allowed people to invest 
individually. 
</P>
<P>
	--''In contrast to welfare, eligibility for Social Security is  
not determined by the beneficiary's current income and assets, nor 
is the amount of the benefit. This is a crucial principle. The 
absence of a means test makes it possible for Social Security to 
provide a stable role in anchoring a retirement system in which 
private pensions and personal savings can be built on top of Social 
Security's basic assured protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--''Social Security compels all of us to contribute to our own  
future security. A voluntary system simply would not work. Some of 
us would save scrupulously, some would save sporadically, and some 
would postpone the day of reckoning forever, leaving the community 
as a whole to pay through a much less desirable safety-net 
system.''

<HEADLINE> Are `Balloon' Mortgages Worth It? / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With interest rates up, ``balloon'' mortgages  
may be looking more attractive to some home buyers searching for 
ways to bring down expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rates on balloon notes right now are more than half a percentage  
point below rates on many conventional mortgages, and that could 
translate into hundreds of dollars in annual savings on interest 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a mid-August survey of lenders by HSH Associates, a Butler,  
N.J.-based mortgage-research firm, five- and seven-year balloons 
averaged between just over 7 percent and 7.5 percent, while rates 
on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages had risen to 8.3 percent, 15-year, 
7.8 percent, and five-year adjustable rate mortgages, 7.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Not a bad comparison, most industry experts will agree. Yet many  
of the experts think most folks should let go of the balloon-loan 
idea because such mortgages may be too risky to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``A balloon note is a recipe for perpetual debt for most people,  
assuming they're not foreclosed,'' said Peter G. Miller, author of 
several home-buying books and operator of a consumer information 
Web site (www.ourbroker.com). 
</P>
<P>
	With balloon mortgages, payments are based on a 30-year  
repayment schedule, which keeps the monthly payments down. That's 
one advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	But here's the downside: After a short period -- usually just  
five or seven years, depending on the note's maturity -- the entire 
balance is due and payable. Homeowners must then pay off the 
mortgage or get another loan and refinance the debt, which usually 
means additional closing costs. If they can't, they could be forced 
to sell their home or be foreclosed on. 
</P>
<P>
	``If rates rise and your income doesn't, you may not be  
qualified to refinance,'' said Miller. ``And what happens if the 
value of your home declines? Lenders may not give you as much 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's why balloons haven't exactly been the most popular  
home-financing option in recent years. In July alone they accounted 
for slightly over 1 percent of mortgage applications received by 
mortgage companies, according to the mortgage lender Freddie Mac. 
However, Freddie Mac predicts that if rates continue to climb, as 
they have through the summer, ``a resurgence in balloon-lending 
activity may occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a time, most homeowners in the United States financed their  
homes continuously over short periods. ``People couldn't get 
financing for more than five years, but that changed after the 
Depression,'' said Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	While balloons may carry many risks, they can be useful for some  
home buyers, mainly those who don't expect to be in their homes for 
very long. That may include first-time buyers with growing families 
or individuals who expect to be relocated by their employers in the 
near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Such home buyers can clearly benefit from the lower rates in the  
meantime, although nearly all their monthly payments will be going 
toward interest rather than principal. 
</P>
<P>
	Balloons also can be beneficial to those individuals who are  
betting (correctly) that rates will drop in the next few years and 
don't want to be concerned with the subsequent payment adjustments 
that occur with ARMs. 
</P>
<P>
	To attract more borrowers, many lenders have added a conversion  
or reset option, which enables a balloon to be converted or 
automatically refinanced for the remainder of the 30-year term near 
the maturity date. 
</P>
<P>
	But here again there's a catch: A conversion usually will only  
be guaranteed if certain criteria is met. In most cases, that may 
mean the borrower would have to make the last 12 to 24 monthly 
mortgage payments on time. 
</P>
<P>
	Such ``unknowns'' only add to the risk factor of balloons,  
experts say. A surprise job loss or illness can lead to a missed 
monthly payment; a company merger can thwart relocation plans; a 
pay cut at work could prevent a family from affording a bigger 
home; interest rates could go north ... 
</P>
<P>
	``You just don't know what's going to happen down the line,''  
said Miller. ``Most households benefit by having conservative 
mortgage options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at HSH, agreed: ``If you think  
you're going to move in the near future ... or you think interest 
rates are going to fall, then you're better off with an ARM.''

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ross Elliott, a character actor who appeared  
in ``I Love Lucy'' and many other television series, died of cancer 
Thursday. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott portrayed Sheriff Abbott for more than three years on  
the long-running 1960s Western series ``The Virginian.'' He was a 
series regular on the soap opera ``General Hospital,'' originating 
the role of Lee Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott had a recurring role on Lucille Ball's sitcom as Ricky  
Ricardo's agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in New York, Elliott began his acting career with Orson  
Welles' Mercury Theater, where he performed in Welles' famed radio 
program ``War of the Worlds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After serving in World War II, Elliott moved to Hollywood and  
appeared in films including ``Woman on the Run,'' ``D-Day the Sixth 
of June,'' ``Kelly's Heroes,'' ``Skyjacked'' and ``The Towering 
Inferno.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His many TV credits included appearances on ``Gunsmoke,''  
``Alfred Hitchcock Presents,'' ``The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' ``Perry 
Mason,'' ``The Twilight Zone,'' ``Maverick'' and ``Little House on 
the Prairie.'' 

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Brion James, who played Leon the murderous  
replicant in ``Blade Runner'' and appeared in character roles in 
more than 100 other movies, died Aug. 7 after suffering a heart 
attack. He was 54. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot, 3-inch James had key roles in such motion pictures  
as ``Corvette Summer,'' ``48 HRS'' and ``Another 48 HRS''. 
</P>
<P>
	James regarded his role as a studio executive in Robert Altman's  
``The Player'' as a career turning point that led to a wider 
variety of roles. But the actor remained in greatest demand for 
thrillers, many of which went straight to video. 
</P>
<P>
	In the classic science fiction film ``Blade Runner,'' James was  
one of the four replicants pursued by a former police officer 
played by Harrison Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	James also appeared in a variety of TV movies and in guest roles  
on such series as ``The Waltons,'' ``CHiPs,'' ``Little House on the 
Prairie,'' ``The Dukes of Hazzard,'' ``The A-Team,'' ``Matlock,'' 
``Miami Vice'' and ``Walker, Texas Ranger.''

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Hanoch Levin, whose plays made him one of  
Israel's most controversial writers and then one of its most 
respected, died Wednesday in Tel Aviv after a long illness. He was 
56. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1968 play, ``You, Me and the Next War,'' bitterly criticized  
what he saw as the delusions of grandeur that swept Israeli society 
in the wake of its victory in the 1967 Mideast war. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, the play pilloried the Israeli mainstream for  
maintaining that Israel had no choice but to launch the war, and 
hard-liners who hoped to retain all the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 
spite of the presence there of Palestinians. The play predicted 
that the Israeli smugness would have dire consequences, including 
another war. 
</P>
<P>
	His supporters argued he proved right when Israel was taken by  
surprise by the 1973 Middle East war.

<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Edward L. Morgan, a Nixon  
administration White House staffer who pleaded guilty to signing a 
backdated deed to Nixon's gift of official vice presidential 
papers, has died. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan died of heart failure Aug. 6 after a lengthy, undisclosed  
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon was seeking a $576,000 tax deduction for donating his  
papers to the National Archives and the donation was actually made 
after expiration of a law providing deductions for such gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan, who said he agreed to sign the deed and backdate it to  
take advantage of the law, pleaded guilty in 1974 to conspiring to 
defraud the government. He wasn't sentenced to prison because he 
cooperated with prosecutors of other Nixon associates. 
</P>
<P>
	He was an attorney who served on the Nixon domestic policy staff  
and as assistant treasury secretary under William E. Simon.

often-defeated prosecutor on television's ``The Perry Mason 
Mysteries,'' died Friday of cancer. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Macaulay was a longtime actor and director in theater, TV and  
movies. Through his friendship with Raymond Burr, television's 
Perry Mason, Macaulay became a partner six years ago in the Raymond 
Burr Vineyards in Healdsburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Born and raised in Kentucky, Macaulay graduated from the Royal  
Academy of Dramatic Arts in London, where he won the First Judges 
Medal. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hollywood he appeared as a guest star in over 200 television

	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Michael Sveda, the researcher who discovered  
cyclamate, a sugar substitute used in soft drinks until it was 
banned in 1969, died at his home in Stamford, Conn. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Sveda, a Toledo native, died Aug. 10 from complications of  
Parkinson's disease, his family said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1934 graduate of the University of Toledo, Sveda accidentally  
discovered cyclamate a few years later while working as a chemical 
researcher for E-I duPont de Nemours &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclamate had become a $1 billion business by the 1960s and  
quadrupled diet drinks' share of the soft-drink market. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FDA banned the substance as a possible cancer hazard.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 125.70 at 10,991.38 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While Internet stocks soared on the promise of a  
strong Christmas, the broader market slumped Wednesday due to a 
more immediate event, a possible interest rate increase next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 125.70 to close at  
10,991.38. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also ended lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 fell 11.32 to 1,332.84. The technology-dominated Nasdaq 
composite index contained its losses, dropping 13.49 to 2,657.73, 
as Dell and many Internet issues rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to  
prevent inflation from accelerating have hurt stocks and bonds over 
the past month, dragging market indicators well below the records 
reached July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, analysts believe the market may not be able to sustain any  
new rallies until after Aug. 24, when the Fed will announce its 
decision on a rate hike. Higher rates can make stocks less 
appealing by cutting into corporate profits. They also can turn 
investors toward bonds, which offer a guaranteed, stable rate of 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the current climate, it will be difficult for the market to  
go much higher,'' said Robert Robbins, senior vice president and 
market strategist at The Robinson-Humphrey Co. Inc. in Atlanta. 
``It will crawl and claw its way up if it goes up at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, stocks did edge higher, helped along Tuesday  
by a moderate report on consumer prices that suggested the Fed may 
restrict its action to a one quarter-percentage point increase in 
short-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wednesday, with no new data to affect trading, buyers backed  
off. Low volume has magnified price swings for the past few weeks 
as many traders take summer vacation and other investors wait for 
the Fed's announcement before making any new commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	Most new bets Wednesday were in favor of technology companies.  
Dell, the nation's largest direct seller of computers, rose 3 7/16 
to 44 9/16 after beating earnings estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet shares were mostly higher after Merrill Lynch analyst  
Henry Blodget raised his rating on several companies, saying they 
should flourish as people turn to the Web for holiday shopping. 
Amazon.com gained 3 7/8 to 113 1/8 and Yahoo! jumped 6 3/16 to 145 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Blodget said investors who seek out the largest, most profitable  
Internet companies should be rewarded with higher share prices as 
inexpensive computers draw more consumers online. 
</P>
<P>
	Applied Materials, a maker of equipment used to make  
semiconductors, plunged 6 11/16 to 65 1/16. The company met 
analysts' expectations in its earnings report, released late 
Tuesday, but warned of slower growth in new orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services companies, typically hurt by higher interest  
rates as lending volume shrinks, fell Wednesday. American Express 
dropped 3 to 137 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM was the worst-performing Dow component, finishing 4 5/8 lower  
at 123 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Weakness in the dollar also hurt stocks as the U.S. currency hit  
a six-month low against the Japanese yen. A weak dollar makes U.S. 
securities less attractive to foreign investors, who may determine 
that stocks or bonds in their own country offer better values. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Volume of all NYSE-listed shares totaled 
831.19 million shares, compared with 829.61 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 5.06 to 623.65, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.41 to 783.92. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.90 to 433.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.18 percent.  
European indexes were mixed, as Germany's DAX index fell 0.6 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 
slipped 0.01 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Swim Team Raises Suspicions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUMBI UMBI, Australia (AP) -- Five-time Olympic and world  
championship swim gold medalist Jenny Thompson says she is 
suspicious of China's decision to send a token squad to the Pan 
Pacific championships. 
</P>
<P>
	China, which has failed to clear up a lingering doubts about the  
use of performance-enhancing drugs, will have just five swimmers at 
the PanPacs starting Sunday, in the last big international meet 
before next year's Sydney Olympics in the same pool. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese squad was cut from 20 and includes no world or  
Olympic champions. Officials said conflicting schedules forced the 
decision to send fewer swimmers but Thompson doesn't buy the 
excuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems awfully strange that they wouldn't come to this  
competition because this is the best competition of the year, the 
best one they're able to swim in,'' Thompson said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why wouldn't they do that? Why wouldn't they want to race the  
people they're going to be racing in the Olympics? 
</P>
<P>
	``If they are going to go to some local meet in China instead  
then it doesn't make much sense. If they want to be good next year 
you'd think they'd want to race the people who are going to be 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another top class swimmer, Australian Olympic champion Susie  
O'Neill, earlier described China's decision as ``suspect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't got any respect for the Chinese swimmers to be  
perfectly honest,'' said O'Neill. ``They've cheated over the years 
and there's been evidence to prove it so hopefully they won't turn 
up at the Olympics either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who is aiming to beat fellow American Mary T.  
Meagher's 1981 100-meter butterfly world record at the meet, has 
been a strong anti-drug activist. 
</P>
<P>
	Having missed out on a gold medal when the Chinese women  
dominated the 1994 world championships in Rome, Thompson came to 
the next edition in Perth armed with ``Say no to drugs'' badges and 
left with four golds and a silver. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States argued for a PanPac ban on China but the  
Chinese were allowed to compete with the support of other member 
nations such as Australia, Japan and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	While world governing body FINA believes China is cleaning up  
its act, Thompson is not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're getting their act together, they could be doing it  
a little faster,'' Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese swimmers Xiong Guoming and Wang Wei tested positive for  
the performance-enhancing drug Clenbuterol in out-of-competition 
check March 8.

<HEADLINE> Bush Won't Answer Drug Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Criticizing what he called the politics of  
rumormongering, Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush 
said today that he won't answer questions about whether he ever 
used drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	At a heated Capitol news conference, the Texas governor chided  
news reporters who raised the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody floats a rumor and it causes you to ask a question,  
and that's the game in American politics, and I refuse to play 
it,'' Bush said. ``That is a game. You just fell for the trap. I 
refuse to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he made mistakes in his youth. ``I was young and  
irresponsible and I behaved young and irresponsibly,'' the governor 
has said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has repeatedly refused to answer questions about whether  
he used drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he was convinced that rumors about his personal life  
were being planted, but he didn't identify who he believes is doing 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're ridiculous and they're absurd, and the people of  
America are sick and tired of this kind of politics. And I'm not 
participating,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if branding such rumors as ``absurd'' meant that he was  
denying ever using drugs, Bush ignored the question and turned to 
another reporter who asked him about a different subject.

<HEADLINE> MetLife Settles Class-Action Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- MetLife would pay at least $1.7 billion to  
settle allegations of improper sales practices involving individual 
life insurance policies and annuity contracts and certificates, 
according to a preliminary agreement with plaintiffs' attorneys 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The class-action litigation, pending in U.S. District Court in  
Pittsburgh for more than four years, was filed on behalf of about 7 
million current and former customers who purchased products from 
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. between 1982 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement must be approved by the court, and a hearing has  
been set for Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	MetLife paid a $25 million fine in Tampa, Fla. and an $800,000  
fine in Connecticut over similar allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	MetLife plans to mail information about the settlement to about  
4 million current and 3 million former customers beginning Aug. 27. 
A toll free number will be available at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``This settlement provides a fair resolution to issues that have  
been the subject of protracted litigation and that have affected 
much of our industry,'' Robert H. Benmosche, chairman and chief 
executive officer of MetLife said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Melvyn L. Weiss, co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said the  
settlement is one of several in recent years involving 
reimbursement for alleged deceptive insurance sales practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The main allegations include:  
</P>
<P>
	--A practice known as ``churning,'' in which an agent sells a  
customer a new, larger policy using the cash value of an existing 
policy to purchase it. When the cash value of the old policy is 
exhausted, the customer must pay the larger premium or let the 
policy lapse. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sales of policies with so-called ``vanishing premiums.''  
Customers were told that after a certain number of years, they 
would not have to pay their premium anymore, but in some cases that 
never happened. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Insurance policies were portrayed as investment products but  
didn't earn the kind of money that customers believed they would 
for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``These practices were common in the industry since the early  
'80s. MetLife was not alone,'' Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prudential Insurance Co. of America has already paid $70 million  
in penalties and set aside $2.6 billion to pay policyholders who 
sued over similar sales practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Foley, vice president of public relations at MetLife, said  
the settlement is in the best interest of its customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's behind us. We think that this settlement ends the issue  
for us,'' Foley said. ``It does not mean that we have any knowledge 
that the allegations are true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar industry settlements have prompted widespread changes in  
terms of insurance industry policies and practices are perceived, 
Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators are continuing investigations into MetLife's  
practices in Florida and Massachusetts.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Louisville Assistant Sues NCAA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Former Louisville basketball assistant  
Scooter McCray sued the NCAA on Wednesday, claiming an 
investigation into the school's basketball program tarnished his 
reputation and has blocked him from coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	After a long career as a player and assistant with the  
Cardinals, McCray left Louisville this summer when his contract 
expired. He has been unable to land another coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every school that had an opening, I sent out resumes and  
received a `thank you, but no thanks' letter,'' McCray said. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer claims the rejections are a fallout from the NCAA  
probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and his family went through two to three years of very bad  
times as a result of the NCAA's allegations,'' lawyer Gregg Hovious 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And even though we believe that in large part the NCAA  
exonerated Scooter of the allegations, it turns out ... people 
across the country in the college basketball community continue to 
believe he was somehow, frankly, a cheat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCray, who filed the suit in Jefferson Circuit Court, claimed  
defamation of character and invasion of privacy by the NCAA. The 
suit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to the NCAA's headquarters in Indianapolis seeking comment  
were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also names Wilson Inn &AMP; Suites as a defendant, claiming  
fraud, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. 
</P>
<P>
	McCray became embroiled in the NCAA's investigation into  
benefits provided Fred Johnson, father of forward Nate Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	McCray was accused of arranging for Fred Johnson to reside at  
the hotel for a discounted rate, then providing his personal credit 
card to ensure Johnson wouldn't be evicted when he was delinquent 
paying his bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit accuses Wilson Inn and its employees of fraudulently  
posting charges to McCray's credit card in violation of his 
agreement with them. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA accused him of two rule violations, and McCray later  
left coach Denny Crum's staff after 10 years and was reassigned as 
a special assistant to athletic director Tom Jurich. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA originally placed the school on probation and banned  
the Cardinals from postseason play last season. It required any 
school interested in hiring McCray to clear the move through the 
NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	An NCAA appeals committee lifted the postseason ban in February  
and limited McCray's penalty to time served. 
</P>
<P>
	McCray still carries the stigma of the investigation, his lawyer  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scooter has sent a lot of resumes out and has not been able to  
even land an interview to be an assistant coach,'' he said, noting 
that before the investigation McCray was often mentioned as a 
future head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``That seems to us to illustrate what this investigation has  
done to Scooter's reputation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit makes no claim against Louisville or Crum. McCray, who  
played on the Cardinals' 1980 national championship team under 
Crum, said the coach supported his fight to have the NCAA charges 
dropped.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Co. Snuffs Out Importers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A tobacco company wants to snuff out U.S.  
sales of cigarettes meant for overseas markets, claiming the 
practice confuses smokers and hurts everyone's profits, from the 
company down to distributors and retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. filed a complaint Tuesday with  
the International Trade Commission in Washington, D.C., accusing 
four importers of violating U.S. laws by dealing in cigarettes 
re-imported into this country. 
</P>
<P>
	B&AMP;W said the Florida- and California-based import businesses buy  
the exported cigarettes at cheap rates and bring them back to this 
country, where the smokes are sold at sharp discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consumers are not getting the product they expect,'' said  
B&AMP;W spokesman Stephen Kottak. ``We're trying to protect the value 
of our trademarks and guard against our consumers being confused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kottak said the re-imported cigarettes also don't carry costs  
associated with the tobacco industry's settlement with states to 
pay for the costs of treating patients with smoking-related 
illnesses. He said that gives the importers a price advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	The cigarette maker had no estimates of how much the so-called  
``gray market'' was costing the company. 
</P>
<P>
	B&AMP;W, the nation's third-largest tobacco manufacturer, asked the  
ITC to ban any domestic sale of its Kool or Lucky Strike brands 
that were meant for export only. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint also seeks to halt the sale of ``gray market''  
cigarettes already imported. 
</P>
<P>
	Importers named in the complaint are Allstate Cigarette  
Distributors Inc. and R.E. Tobacco Sales Inc., both based in Miami; 
Prestige Storage &AMP; Distribution Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and 
Dood Enterprises Inc., based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricardo Hernandez, manager of R.E. Tobacco Sales, said the  
importers are legitimate businesses and that his business pays 
state and federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez said he thought B&AMP;W's action was in response to  
complaints from its traditional distributors who felt threatened by 
the importers who offered cigarettes at lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smokers can buy it cheaper and what's wrong with that?'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the other three import businesses named in the  
complaint did not return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	ITC spokesman John Greer said the agency will decide within a  
month whether to start an investigation into B&AMP;W's complaint.

<HEADLINE> Appeals Court To Rethink Irish Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Three former Irish fugitives who were freed  
last fall after a federal appeals court overturned their 
extradition had the same court withdraw that decision Wednesday and 
schedule a new hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals set a new hearing for  
Sept. 28 after the federal government asked it to reconsider its 
earlier ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The court had previously set aside a judge's extradition order  
and called for an examination of possible bias in Northern Ireland 
courts under British occupation. 
</P>
<P>
	In requesting reconsideration of the ruling, the Justice  
Department said there was an issue of whether U.S. courts can 
inquire into possible bias in another country's court system. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men, Kevin Artt, Pol Brennan and Terence Kirby, remain  
free on bail. They were among 38 opponents of British rule in 
Northern Ireland who escaped from the Maze prison near Belfast in 
September 1983. The three were arrested separately in California a 
decade later. 
</P>
<P>
	Artt and Kirby were both serving sentences for murder,  
convictions based on confessions that they said were beaten out of 
them. Brennan was convicted of possessing explosives that police 
said were to be used to blow up a Belfast shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's order comes at a time of uncertainty about the May  
1998 peace agreement in Northern Ireland. A new Protestant-Catholic 
administration was to have been in place by now, but the major 
Protestant party has balked because of the Irish Republican Army's 
refusal to disarm.

	DENVER (AP) -- Newly acquired Ariel Graziani scored the only goal  
Dallas needed in the fourth minute as the Burn shut out the 
league-leading Colorado Rapids 3-0 Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Graziani was acquired from New England last Friday.

<P>
	It was the Ecuadorian's first Major League Soccer goal. Oscar  
Pareja passed the ball to Graziani, who kicked it past two

	Dallas goalkeeper Matt Jordan got his eighth shutout of the  
season, matching Kevin Hartman of Los Angeles for the league lead.

	Burn forward Jason Kreis' pass in the 30th minute set up  
Pareja's goal against Rapids goalie Ian Feuer.

	Food Lion Buying Hannaford Bros.  
</P>
<P>
	SCARBOROUGH, Maine (AP) -- Food Lion, a big supermarket chain in  
the Southeast, is buying New England-based Hannaford Bros. Co. and 
its 152 stores as the grocery industry further consolidates in a 
fight for survival with discounters like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The 
company to be created under today's deal would have more than 1,400 
stores from Maine to Florida, and $13.5 billion in annual sales, 
making it the nation's six-largest food retailer. Food Lion's $3.35 
billion cash-and-stock offer was the best of four bids, Hannaford 
said. Hannaford stock ended up 9 1/16, or 14.2 percent, at 72 3/4.

<HEADLINE> Text of Merlene Ottey's Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Following is the text of the statement issued by  
sprinter Merlene Ottey's management on her withdrawal from the 
World Track and Field Championships in Seville, Spain, following 
reports she tested positive for the banned substance Nandrolone: 
</P>
<P>
	On August 15, 1999, the management agency of Merlene Ottey was  
contacted via phone by a representative of the IAAF that supposedly 
a positive A-test sample was found in a drug test taken from 
Merlene Ottey at the EAA-Meeting in Lucerne on July 5, 1999, with 
the alleged substance Nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	However, to this date the athlete has not received any detailed  
or specific information about the actual results of the test. Based 
on these circumstances, Merlene Ottey has decided to withdraw from 
the upcoming IAAF World Championships in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	Merlene Ottey: ``To write this statement has been the most  
difficult and emotionally draining experience of my life. I have 
lived my personal and athletic life with the utmost honesty and 
integrity. I have applied only the highest ethical standards to 
myself and expect the same from others. I have always proclaimed 
fairness in sports and adamantly oppose the use of banned 
substances. I owe it to my family, my country, my beloved sport and 
all my fans around the world to prove that this is a terrible 
mistake and that I will do everything in my power to find the truth 
and prove my innocence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1979, Merlene Ottey has been tested approximately 100  
times during her international career. All results were negative. 
The most recent tests in Ljubjliana on May 12, 1999, and in 
Stockholm on July 30, 1999, have also shown negative results. 
Merlene Ottey competed every week at international competitions 
since May 29, 1999, until July 5, 1999, and was easily accessible 
for testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Merlene Ottey is planning to undergo a voluntary drug test under  
the supervision of the Jamaican Athletic Federation as soon as 
possible and intends to communicate such results to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	She will be available for further comments when the exact  
A-sample test results from the meeting in Lucerne on July 5, 1999, 
are received.

<HEADLINE> Nebiolo Elected as IAAF President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Primo Nebiolo, who has ruled track and  
field for two decades, was reelected to a sixth term today as 
president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 76-year-old Italian, the only candidate on the ballot, was  
reaffirmed by acclamation for another four-year mandate at the IAAF 
Congress on the eve of the World Championships in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebiolo received a standing ovation from the delegates after  
IAAF vice president Lamine Diack praised his ``exceptional 
competence'' and asked for a unanimous vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have dedicated my life to athletics,'' Nebiolo said after  
the applause. ``I pledge you my energy and commitment and will 
strive to live up to your expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nebiolo, who has run the IAAF since 1981, has retained his  
unchallenged hold on power despite rumors of ill health and 
frequent complaints about his autocratic style. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than a year, Nebiolo has been rumored to be suffering  
from prostate cancer, but he and his aides have denied the 
suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am well and I hope people continue to talk about my health  
because it brings me luck,'' Nebiolo said this week. ``I heard I am 
sick, but what can I say? I am not the fighter I once was, but I am 
still in perfect shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two decades, Nebiolo has been among the world's  
most powerful sports rulers, along with IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch and former world soccer (FIFA) president Joao Havelange. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being chief of the IAAF, Nebiolo has been  
president of the International University Sport Federation (FISU) 
since 1961, president of the Association of Summer Olympics 
International Federations (ASOIF) since 1983, a member of the 
International Olympic Committee since 1992, and president of the 
University Sports Club of Turin, his hometown, since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	During his time in power, Nebiolo has revolutionized the sport  
and his federation. 
</P>
<P>
	When he took over in 1981, the IAAF had fewer than 100 members.  
Now, there are 210. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF had a one-room office in a dingy London neighborhood.  
For the past six years, it has had a sprawling layout in wealthy 
and glamorous Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization's budget then was $50,000. Now, it's more than  
$50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebiolo has skillfully overseen the transition of the sport from  
amateur to professional. 
</P>
<P>
	He introduced prize money, appearance fees, world-record  
bonuses, the world indoor and outdoor championships, the World Cup, 
the lucrative Grand Prix and Golden League circuits, and the world 
cross country, world marathon, world half-marathon and world junior 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	While directing the IAAF's steady growth, Nebiolo also has been  
the center of much controversy. He has been called dictatorial, 
scheming and money grabbing, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action today, the IAAF elected four vice presidents:  
Diack of Senegal, Arne Ljungqvist of Sweden, Amadeo Frances of 
Puerto Rico, and Lou Dapeng of China. They also were the only 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Also reappointed by acclamation was honorary treasurer Robert  
Stinson of Britain.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Still Good Mortgage Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- No jobs, little recent credit history, and  
$5.5 million in debts. With that balance sheet, President Clinton 
and his wife, Hillary, are shopping for million-dollar real estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Would a banker go for this deal?  
</P>
<P>
	The short answer is yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Although the Clintons might look like a poor credit risk in some  
ways, if history is any guide they will earn plenty after leaving 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has said this himself ... 'Don't cry any tears for me.'  
Ex-presidents do just fine,'' said Stephen Hess, who lectures and 
writes about the presidency at the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-presidents typically make a bundle from writing their memoirs  
and perhaps another book or two. They can give speeches at $50,000 
a pop and line up cash or stock deals for service on corporate 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess said Clinton's first book deal alone could pay for any of  
the swank, secluded Westchester County, N.Y., houses the Clintons 
are scouting. One they saw last weekend runs $2.3 million. Another 
is a relative bargain at $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Reagan, the last two-term president to retire, commanded  
$50,000 a speech after leaving office, and once took $2 million for 
a few days of speeches and appearances in Japan. He also got a 
reported advance of $5 million for his memoirs and a book of 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Ford has made millions serving on corporate directors'  
boards, and George Bush, wealthy to begin with, has also done well 
on the speech circuit. Jimmy Carter, the last Democrat to leave the 
office, makes a comfortable living as an author and lecturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, seven figures for a house is fast company for a couple  
who have not carried a mortgage since 1983 in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons have a reported net worth of roughly $1.5 million --  
much of it in trust. Clinton makes $200,000 a year as president. 
</P>
<P>
	But they still owe about $5.5 million to lawyers for work on the  
Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky investigations. If an independent 
legal trust fund runs dry, the Clintons may have to pay the bills 
out of pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	When he leaves office at the end of his second term in January  
2001, Clinton will have a $151,800 presidential pension, plus an 
undetermined amount for expenses such as an office and staff to 
answer mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``The typical loan approval process would raise some questions  
about stability of income,'' was the dry observation of Paul Reid, 
executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would obviously say in this case there's some extenuating  
circumstances'' that make the Clintons a good credit risk, Reid 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Clintons will be relatively young when they leave the White  
House -- still in their 50s -- with years of earning potential before 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	They would qualify for a pretty hefty mortgage just assuming  
Clinton will be the family breadwinner, but Mrs. Clinton could do 
as well or better financially, particularly if she did not win a 
Senate seat in New York. As a senator, her annual salary would be 
about $130,000. As a partner in a marquee law firm she'd probably 
pull down at least $500,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is considering the 2000 race to succeed retiring  
Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. If she runs, she would 
have to live in the state before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said last month that he and his wife decided shortly  
after settling in at the White House that they would move to New 
York when his presidency ended, although neither has lived there. 
He said he would ``divide my time between New York and going home 
to Arkansas, and finishing my library and doing my work there.'' 
While he was governor, Mrs. Clinton was a partner in the Rose Law 
Firm in Little Rock.

	``Houses are expensive in New York,'' Hess said. ``It does seem  
unrealistic to anyone outside of that market ... but what are they 
going to do? A little pied-a-terre above the library in Little 
Rock?''

<HEADLINE> Alcan Interested in Reynolds Metals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The battle for Reynolds Metals Inc. became  
a bit more complicated as Alcan Aluminium Ltd. disclosed it has no 
plans to bid for the whole company, but would be interested if 
Reynolds decided to sell some assets. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, two suitors have made offers for the nation's  
third-largest aluminum company. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh-based Alcoa, the largest aluminum producer, has made  
a hostile bid for Reynolds worth $65 a share, or about $4.2 
billion. Chicago-based investment group Michigan Avenue Partners 
has also made a bid, but has not disclosed details other than to 
say it's higher that Alcoa's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds has said that the company is open to ``exploring all  
alternatives to maximize shareholder value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, however, Reynolds' board rejected Alcoa's bid, saying  
it was not good enough. Alcoa subsequently took its all-cash bid to 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcan spokesman Marcel Barthe said Wednesday that APA, Alcan's  
parent company, would not participate in the bidding for Reynolds. 
``Things might evolve differently in the weeks to come if 
circumstances evolve if the Reynolds assets are not sold in one 
unit,'' Barthe added. 
</P>
<P>
	An Alcan offer -- even for a part of Reynolds -- will not happen  
any time soon, said J. Clarence Morrison, senior metals analyst at 
Prudential Securities. The Canadian aluminum maker last week 
announced its own merger with Pechiney SA of France and 
Switzerland's Alusuisse Lonza Group and has its hands full. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are tied up for probably three months or better meeting  
regulatory requirements and I cannot see them doing anything in 
that time frame, by which time Reynolds will already be 
dissipated,'' Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alcan's expression of interest raises the possibility of a  
spinoff, said Lloyd O'Carroll, an analyst at Scott and Stringfellow 
in Richmond and former chief economist at Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the options in selling Reynolds is to find buyers for  
all of the various assets and then see whether the total proceeds 
would be higher than what Alcoa or Michigan Avenue have offered for 
the whole thing,'' O'Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Reynolds can present a credible threat to spin the company  
off, it could bring in more money for shareholders either directly 
or by forcing Reynolds' suitors to raise their offering price, said 
Robert Dammon, an assistant professor of finance at the 
Carnegie-Mellon University Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Reynolds has accepted they're going to be sold and  
they're making an effort to bid the price up,'' Dammon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now their efforts are going to be focussed on doing the  
best for their shareholders,'' Dammon said. ``One tactic they might 
follow to get the best price is to threaten Alcoa with selling the 
assets of the company piecemeal. Alcoa certainly wouldn't want that 
to happen. That may force Alcoa's hand and raise the price a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alcan is particularly interested in some of the ``crown jewels''  
of Reynolds' aluminum assets -- two smelters in Canada and a 
refinery in Australia, said O'Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcan, already the world's second largest aluminum foil producer  
behind Reynolds, might face antitrust problems if it were to 
acquire Reynolds' consumer packaging business, O'Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Reynolds were down 62 1/2 cents to $67.87 1/2 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> 4 Charged in Internet Stock Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. (AP) -- Four men were arrested by federal  
authorities Wednesday on charges they used Internet Web sites and 
e-mail newsletters to try to drive up the stock values of eight 
companies through misleading information. 
</P>
<P>
	The four were charged in a two-count indictment in U.S. District  
Court in Hauppauge with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and 
conspiracy to commit money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch said the case was striking  
because it demonstrated how traditional boiler room securities 
fraud schemes had moved to cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants were accused of reaching hundreds of thousands of  
potential investors through the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defendants were able to manipulate stock supply and prices  
without hiring large staffs of brokers, traders and cold callers to 
do their bidding,'' she said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This perverse abuse of the immense communicative power of the  
Internet should act as a warning to all investors to be wary when 
relying on the accuracy of Internet investment recommendations,'' 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI Assistant Director Lewis Schiliro said the case should serve  
as a warning to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Caution should be the password used by all before logging on  
to cyberspace commerce,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of those who were arrested and charged had been barred  
from the securities industry before. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment said the defendants promoted the eight companies  
through a Web site known as ``stockplayer.com'' and through a 
related Internet investment newsletter known as ``Stockplayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants allegedly misstated the financial results and  
business prospects of the companies it profiled. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors identified the four as Vincent Napolitano, 38, of  
Oyster Bay; Irving Stitsky, 45, of Brookville; Jordan Shamah, 41, 
of Westbury; and Robert Kessler, 40, of Syosset. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, the four could face prison terms of up to 20 years  
on the most serious charge, along with millions of dollars in fines 
or restitution.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Have Troubled Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Since last January, when they won their first  
playoff game in more than half a century, very little has gone 
right for the Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	First came the usual, injuries and contract disputes.  
</P>
<P>
	But the latest blow is the worst -- an auto accident that injured  
starters Lester Holmes and Carl Simpson and left doctors trying to 
save the right arm of backup offensive lineman Ernest Dye. 
</P>
<P>
	It's left the players shaking their heads.  
</P>
<P>
	``All things turn for the better at some point,'' defensive end  
Simeon Rice said. ``Our backs aren't to the wall yet. We still have 
bullets we haven't fired yet. The best is yet to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was supposed to be a season of great expectations.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Cardinals were 9-7, their first winning season  
since they moved from St. Louis, and they won a playoff game for 
the first time in 51 years. They also developed an emerging star at 
quarterback in charismatic Jake Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
	But things turned in the off-season, as they have so often for  
this franchise wherever it's been. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters in Mesa defeated a plan to finally build the Cardinals a  
stadium of their own. Two of last season's leaders, offensive 
tackle Lomas Brown and linebacker Jamir Miller, left via free 
agency, then the Cardinals angered fans by cutting fullback Larry 
Centers, who had toiled without complaint through the years of 
losing only to become expensive excess baggage to the front office. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on the first day of camp, came another public relations  
disaster, the release of tight end Chris Gedney, who had undergone 
surgery to remove his colon. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a week into camp, the team signed its top draft pick,  
wide receiver David Boston, but its other first-round choice, 
offensive tackle L.J. Shelton, remains in a bitter contract dispute 
with owner Bill Bidwill, who has refused to give in to the trend of 
voidable years and incentive clauses. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Rob Moore, miffed at being tagged the team's  
franchise player, stayed away from camp. So did defensive tackle 
Mark Smith, who insists he is worth at least twice the $500,000 the 
Cardinals are offering. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to put a team together when you have some key parts  
missing,'' coach Vince Tobin said. ``We've had a lot of different 
things off the football field that have affected these guys. 
Whether it's been injury or illness, or guys going to other teams, 
we're going to be a different football team than we were at the end 
of last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The tragic stuff with the kids in the accident, you feel  
fortunate they're alive,'' said general manager Bob Ferguson. ``So 
we're happy to be able to see them and look them in the eye again. 
That's not a regular happening. But the holdouts are, that happens 
everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, unfortunately, are injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	Eric Swann, one of the NFL's best offensive tackles when  
healthy, is still rehabilitating from extensive knee surgery and 
it's uncertain whether he will be ready for the season opener. 
Starting guard Chris Dishman went back to his native Nebraska for 
surgery to flush bone fragments from his right elbow and might not 
be ready for the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Swann and Smith, the Cardinals' defense was manhandled  
in a 38-7 loss to Denver last Saturday in Arizona's preseason 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	What happened next was worse.  
</P>
<P>
	Headed up Interstate 17 for a final week of training camp, Dye's  
Mercedes veered off the rain-slicked freeway and overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes, a starting offensive guard, was driving and was the only  
one wearing a seatbelt. He severely cut his face and went back to 
his home in Phoenix to recuperate. Simpson, a starter at defensive 
tackle in the absence of Swann and Smith, injured his hip. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye's arm was pinned beneath his car, crushed so badly that  
doctors feared they might have to amputate. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the coaching staff is trying to fill the holes left  
on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive line, already missing a starter with Brown's  
departure, is without Holmes, Dishman and Dye. The defensive line, 
without Swann, Smith and now Simpson, has gone from a strength to a 
major liability. 
</P>
<P>
	One more problem.  
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals break camp on Thursday and play at home Friday  
night against Tennessee at Sun Devil Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Because school starts next week at Northern Arizona University,  
site of the training camp, the workouts shift next week to the 
team's Tempe headquarters, where 100-plus degree heat will make 
things even more uncomfortable.

<HEADLINE> David Rosengarten Has `Taste' Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Rosengarten's most successful recipe may  
not be something he can eat, but it sure is something he can 
``Taste.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosengarten hosts three programs on the cable Food Network: the  
chef-demonstrated ``Taste'' cooking show; ``In Food Today,'' a talk 
show; and ``Taste Test,'' which he describes as ``food 
`Jeopardy!''' 
</P>
<P>
	When the producers of ``Taste Test'' first approached him,  
Rosengarten said he was unsure if he could carry off a game show. 
But it didn't take long to discover ``the Bob Eubanks inside me,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had all the game show voices running through my head. It was  
alarmingly natural. I loved the game aspect. I really couldn't wait 
to see who'd win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Taste Test,'' which premiered last month, is taped before a  
live audience in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosengarten, 49, earned a doctorate in theater history and  
taught that subject at Cornell University and Skidmore College, 
both in upstate New York. It was while he was at Skidmore that he 
began to teach cooking classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up in an insane foodie family. Since I was a kid, I'd  
be a part of making the shopping list and the meals,'' he said 
during an interview at the Food Network studio. 
</P>
<P>
	``My knowledge comes from interest. In France, chefs are proud  
that they are self-taught. I taught myself how to cook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is the author of three cookbooks. His most recent, ``Taste''  
(Random House), builds on the themes of the TV show. The cookbook 
won a 1999 Julia Child Cookbook Award. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosengarten said the ``Taste'' cooking show is his chance to be  
a ``food kvetch.'' He gives his point of view on each dish as he 
explains its history and demonstrates the proper presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've done five years of `Taste,' which is 500 shows, and I  
could do 500 more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His only on-screen recipe disaster was a ``Taste'' show about  
chocolate mousse. After he spent most of the half-hour discussing 
the criteria of a perfect light and airy mousse, the mousse fell 
flat. 
</P>
<P>
	Contrary to his image -- that he dines on only expensive foie  
gras, caviar and champagne -- Rosengarten said he is truly 
interested in all food. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good food doesn't have to be `chichi.' I try to make people  
understand that every food is worthy of respect and is capable of 
providing enjoyment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosengarten gained between 20 and 30 pounds during the years he  
reviewed restaurants as the New York food critic for Gourmet 
magazine, a post he recently resigned. He was so busy analyzing the 
food, he didn't feel like he had dined, so he would go home and eat 
a couple of burgers at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	He is now on a low-carb, high-protein plan to shed the weight,  
but doesn't like diets. 
</P>
<P>
	French food eaten in France is his favorite cuisine. For his  
last meal, he would want French oysters, Chaource cheese (which he 
describes as smelly, runny and ripe), and fruit ice cream from 
southern Italy. If he were going to be stranded on a desert island 
with only one thing to eat, he would want shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Taste Test'' airs Saturdays at 6:30 p.m. (EDT) and Sundays at  
2 p.m. (EDT). ``Taste'' is shown weekdays at 10:30 a.m. (EDT). ``In 
Food Today,'' co-hosted by Donna Hanover, is shown weekdays at 6:30 
p.m. (EDT).

<HEADLINE> Ventura As Referee Called a Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The watchdog group Common Cause Minnesota  
filed a complaint Wednesday against Gov. Jesse Ventura, saying he 
will violate conflict of interest laws by refereeing a wrestling 
event this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wrestling Federation match is to be held Sunday at the  
Target Center. Ventura is a former professional wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
	Common Cause President David Schultz said the governor has used  
his ``official position to secure benefits for himself which are 
distinct from benefits available to the general public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint also said Ventura's refereeing job might affect  
his judgment as governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Specifically, as governor, he may be called upon to make  
official decisions now or in the future regarding the Target Center 
or the WWF,'' the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz has asked the state Department of Employee Relations to  
determine whether the governor has violated conflict of interest 
laws and, if so, to ``undertake appropriate enforcement action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department official who would handle such a complaint was  
unavailable for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has said he will donate to charity the $100,000 fee he  
is getting from the WWF to referee. He also is likely to receive at 
least $1 million in video royalties and the use of his trademarked 
name. Ventura has not said what he would do with that money. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's spokesman John Wodele called the complaint  
``irritating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor obviously is not one out of the conventional  
mold,'' Wodele said. ``Common Cause, other politicians and elected 
officials obviously have some trouble with that.''

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Prices Mostly Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures prices rose, and corn and soybean  
futures prices settled lower in trading Wednesday on the Chicago 
Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices moved higher as export business remains  
strong. The market was buoyed by news Egypt has purchased 120,000 
metric tons of soft white wheat for October loading. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase was in addition to buys made by a private Egyptian  
miller on Tuesday and purchases by several other nations. The 
export news countered profit-taking that entered the market 
following Tuesday's strong showing. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices fell on the belief in the market that  
Tuesday's price rise was overdone. There was also concern about 
weak export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain in the Midwest also affected the market, although experts  
believe it is unlikely the precipitation will be of much help to 
the corn crop. 
</P>
<P>
	The Midwest rain did have an adverse affect on soybean futures  
prices. The weakness of corn prices also put pressure on soybean 
futures. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for September delivery settled 1 1/2 cents higher at $2.70 1/2 a  
bushel; September corn was 1 1/2 cents lower at $2.15 a bushel; 
September oats were 3/4 cent lower at $1.06 1/2 a bushel; August 
soybeans were 2 1/4 cents lower at $4.62 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Livestock and hog futures were mostly lower in trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakness of hog futures put pressure on the entire market,  
the weak hog prices stemming from lower cash prices and light 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle were .15 cent higher at 66.50 cents a pound;  
August feeder cattle were .07 cent lower at 77.30 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs were 1.45 cents lower at 42.40 a pound; August 
pork bellies were .05 cent lower at 51.35 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Profit-Taking Sinks Grain, Soybeans / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were lower in  
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices slipped as the market reacted to concern  
that Tuesday's advance was overdone. The selloff was limited by 
ongoing worries that the size of the corn crop will be smaller than 
previous estimates by the U.S. Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakness of the corn market spilled over to soybean futures.  
</P>
<P>
	Overnight rain in Nebraska and Iowa and the expectation the wet  
weather will move east had limited impact on the market. Experts 
say the rain will be of little benefit to crops. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline of wheat futures prices was limited by the prospect  
of strong export sales. The warm, dry weather forecast for the 
northern Plains is expected to speed the harvest of the spring 
wheat crop, which is adding pressure to prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading, wheat for September delivery was a 1/2 cent  
lower at $2.68 1/2 a bushel; September corn was 1 3/4 cents lower at 
$2.14 3/4 a bushel; September oats were 1 cent lower at $1.06 1/4 a 
bushel; September soybeans were 2 1/2 cents lower at $4.63 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and hog futures were mostly lower in early trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live hogs were unchanged at 66.35 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle were .05 cent higher at 77.42 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs were .10 cent lower at 43.75 cents a pound; August pork 
bellies were .40 cent lower at 51 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Report Says Teen Drug Use Is Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teen drug use fell last year, with about one  
in 10 teen-agers using marijuana and other drugs, the government 
reported today. Officials say it's solid evidence that the nation 
has turned a corner after rising drug use through the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, drug use among Americans of all ages remained level,  
but use among young adults continued its steady rise, according to 
the annual household survey of 25,500 people ages 12 and up. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, 78 million Americans had tried illegal drugs at some  
point in their lives. Marijuana remained far and away the most 
popular drug, but 41.3 million Americans also had tried another 
heroin, cocaine or some other illegal drug, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of them, 13.6 million were current users, about half what it was  
at its 1979 peak. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey results were released today by Health and Human  
Services Secretary Donna Shalala and Barry McCaffrey, President 
Clinton's drug policy adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	``While these results give us reason to be optimistic, we cannot  
let up on our efforts,'' a statement from Clinton said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse also measured  
cigarette smoking and found it down to 27.7 percent overall, the 
lowest rate recorded. But smoking remained steady among teens and 
continued to rise among young adults. Cigar use edged up. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey is most carefully watched as a gauge of teen drug  
use. 
</P>
<P>
	It found 9.9 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds had used some sort  
of drugs within the past month, down from 11.4 percent in 1997. A 
second government survey, which uses a different method to measure 
teen drug use, has found that drug use was stable over the past two 
years after years on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the battle against illicit drugs we've turned the corner,''  
Shalala said today. But she added a cautionary note: ``We have a 
long way to go. We have a long way to go because more than a 
million young people are dependent on drugs. As far as we're 
concerned, that's a million too many.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier reports signaling a leveling off of teen drug use have  
been greeted with cautious optimism, but researchers are now 
confident that a real decline is under way. 
</P>
<P>
	The portion of teens saying they had ever used drugs was also  
down, from 18.8 percent in 1997 to 16.4 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The declines were driven by older teens -- those ages 16 and 17 --  
with the percentage having used drugs in the past year falling from 
30.7 percent to 26.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Marijuana -- the most popular drug -- tends to fuel the overall  
rate, though its usage has fluctuated over the past few years. Last 
year it fell to 8.3 percent among teens, back to its 1995 level and 
still significantly higher than the 3.4 percent recorded in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, teen drug use rose through much of the 1990s and is  
still much higher than it was in 1991 and 1992. Researchers 
attribute the rise to a relaxing of the intense prevention efforts 
of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's news was not as good for young adults aged 18 to 25. The  
survey found 16.1 percent of them were ``current users,'' meaning 
they had used drugs in the past month. That rate has been gradually 
rising, up from 13.3 percent in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, cocaine use was up, from 1.2 percent in 1997 to 2  
percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials suspect that the rising statistics relate to this  
particular group of people -- the same people who were more likely 
to use drugs when they were teen-agers, who have now become young 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, drug use among all ages remained level in 1998, with  
13.6 million current users. That's 6.2 percent of the population, 
statistically unchanged from 6.4 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But over time, the rates have increased among minority groups.  
The percent of blacks currently using drugs has jumped from 5.8 
percent in 1993 to 8.2 percent last year. Hispanics saw a similar 
rise, from 4.4 percent to 6.1 percent over those five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen and adult drug use is driven largely by use of marijuana,  
which attracts nearly twice as many users as cocaine, heroin, LSD 
and other drugs combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall use of marijuana was steady in 1998, with about 11  
million Americans smoking it in the month preceding the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings from the survey:  
</P>
<P>
	--Heroin: A total of 130,000 people were currently using heroin,  
double the number in 1993. And the age of users was dropping. In 
1997, the typical heroin user was 17.6 years old the first time 
they tried it, down from 18.3 percent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cocaine: The number of users was stable in 1998, with about  
1.75 million, though there were increases among teens and young 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cigarettes: Some 60 million Americans age 12 and up said they  
were current smokers, down from 29.6 percent in 1997. Among young 
adults, the percentage has steadily increased from 34.6 percent in 
1994 to 41.6 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cigars: Use increased to 6.9 percent last year from 5.9 percent  
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> 'Dolphin-Safe' Label Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Environmental groups sued Wednesday to  
block a federal decision allowing tuna to be sold as 
``dolphin-safe'' even when it is caught with the huge, encircling 
nets once blamed for killing hundreds of thousands of dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a death warrant for dolphins,'' said Sam LaBudde, a  
marine biologist who led the ``dolphin-safe'' campaign in the 1980s 
after posing as a cook on a Mexican tuna boat for six months and 
videotaping the slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The decade-old ``dolphin-safe'' standard, which bans such nets  
and requires observers on the tuna boats to certify that no 
dolphins are harmed, has dramatically decreased dolphin deaths. 
Fewer than 2,000 dolphins were reported killed because of tuna 
fishing last year, compared with 133,000 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Latin American fleet has generally not complied and  
therefore is barred from selling its tuna in lucrative U.S. 
markets. Mexican officials consider it a free trade issue, 
complaining that the ``dolphin-safe'' standard is an unfair 
barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the Clinton administration in 1997 ordered the  
rules changed to allow use of the purse-seine nets as long as boats 
carry observers who must certify that the fishermen allowed the 
dolphins to escape without injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists got an amendment passed blocking the change  
unless the government could prove the nets don't harm dolphins. 
Despite extensive evidence to the contrary, the plaintiffs say, 
Commerce Secretary William Daley declared in April that researchers 
couldn't prove that depleted dolphin populations would be harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	That cleared the way for the proposal to go into effect in  
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce officials dispute that the changed standard will kill  
more dolphins. Terry Garcia, assistant commerce secretary for 
oceans and atmosphere, said using the big nets is actually better 
environmentally because it will reduce bycatch of other species. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins are at risk because schools of yellowfin tuna often  
swim below dolphin herds off the central Pacific coast. From the 
1950s to 1980s, dolphin populations were decimated as tuna 
fishermen hauled in both species, keeping the tuna and sloughing 
off the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	About 95 percent of the world's tuna fleet has given up fishing  
with purse-seine nets, but about 100 boats in Mexico, Panama, 
Colombia and Venezuela still fish the old way, said David Phillips, 
director of the Earth Island Institute, another of the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all environmental groups back the lawsuit. Greenpeace, the  
World Wildlife Fund, the Center for Marine Conservation and the 
Environmental Defense Fund argue that as long as the Latin American 
fleets are treated as renegades, they will kill dolphins in higher 
numbers than if observers are on board the boats. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules require the observers to certify that tuna caught  
while dolphins are injured or killed was stored and processed 
separately. But without the ``dolphin-safe'' label, tuna is worth 
roughly half as much, a loss of up to $1 million per boatload, 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	LaBudde says that places too much faith in the ability of a  
solitary observer to monitor boatloads of fishermen who depend on 
the higher profits that come with the ``dolphin-safe'' label. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you think a Mexican observer won't be under pressure to  
fabricate that dolphins weren't injured, you're wrong,'' he said. 
``The observer's job under this proposed system would be an 
unbelievable nightmare.''

<HEADLINE> Students Face Suspension for Hazing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURNSVILLE, Minn. (AP) -- Nearly 100 Burnsville High School  
students face suspensions or community service for taking part in a 
hazing incident in which popular freshmen were paddled, smeared 
with ketchup and mustard, and forced to roll in mud. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen to 20 students were humiliated and bruised during the  
end-of-the-school-year ritual in June. The freshmen apparently were 
chosen by seniors-to-be on the basis of their popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	People identified as participants have a choice of two  
disciplinary options, Burnsville Superintendent Benjamin Kanninen 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	They can elect to be suspended from school for five days and  
from extracurricular activities for six weeks. Those who aren't 
involved in after-school activities would be excluded from prom and 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	The alternative is making presentations to their peers on why  
hazing is wrong and performing 20 hours of community service 
through the Dakota County corrections department. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of kids think what this amounts to is just a slap on the  
wrist, but it is more than just that,'' said Burnsville Police 
Chief David Farrington. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanninen said he believes the hazing may have been going on for  
three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this is where it has to stop,'' he said. ``And we will  
stop it.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Fearing Mutilation Has Asylum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A woman who fled Africa two years ago to avoid  
genital mutilation has been awarded political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Immigration Appeals granted the petition of  
Adelaide Abankwah on the ground that she had good reason to fear 
genital cutting if she returned to her native Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Abankwah, 29, is the second woman to win asylum in the  
United States because of the threat of genital mutilation, which 
millions of African girls and women undergo each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Abankwah was arrested for trying to enter the country with  
false immigration papers when she arrived at Kennedy International 
Airport on March 29, 1997. She had fled her isolated tribe of about 
400 people. 
</P>
<P>
	She immediately requested asylum, telling Immigration and  
Naturalization Service officials that she feared village leaders 
would order her killed or would force her to undergo genital 
mutilation because she violated tribal customs by losing her 
virginity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Immigration Appeals, which rules on asylum issues,  
granted her petition Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandy Sullivan of Equality Now, a feminist group that lobbied  
for asylum, said Ms. Abankwah was relieved by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very hard for her to comprehend -- that it's all over and  
no one (is) going to come snatch her back,'' Ms. Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Abankwah has been living in the Bronx with Pentecostal  
Minister Victoria Otumfuor, who also is from Ghana, and has been 
volunteering at Equality Now. 
</P>
<P>
	The precedent for recognizing genital mutilation in amnesty  
rulings was established in the case by Fauziya Kassindja, who fled 
Togo hours before she was to be cut. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ms. Kassindja reached the United States, she was  
imprisoned for 16 months. She ultimately won a landmark 1996 asylum 
ruling in which the INS recognized female genital mutilation as a 
form of persecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., is sponsoring a bill that would  
formalize gender persecution as a grounds for granting amnesty.

<HEADLINE> Great Lakes Water Moratorium Backed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Canada should not  
consider any bulk sales of Great Lakes water while the issue is 
being studied, a U.S.-Canadian commission said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be a bias in favor of retaining water in the  
system and using it more efficiently and effectively,'' said 
Leonard Legault, chairman of the International Joint Commission's 
Canadian section. 
</P>
<P>
	The Great Lakes water has never been sold in bulk, and there are  
no requests pending in either country to move water out via 
pipeline, truck or ship. However, an aborted sales proposal last 
year aroused concern on both sides of the border, leading to the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	``You fix the roof when the sun shines, and right now there are  
not any demands for big bulk removal,'' said Thomas Baldini, who 
heads the commission's U.S. section. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission -- in an interim report released Wednesday --  
suggested a six-month moratorium on bulk water sales while it 
completes its yearlong study of the issue. That study is intended 
to help determine the governments' next steps. 
</P>
<P>
	There is sentiment in both governments for making sure the water  
doesn't become a long-haul commodity. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ottawa, Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy issued a  
statement promising to introduce amendments to the International 
Boundary Waters Treaty Act this fall that will enable Canada to 
prohibit removal of water from the lakes.	   In Washington, legislation already has been introduced to ban 
bulk shipments of Great Lakes water pending joint action by both 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	That bill's sponsor, Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., said Wednesday  
that the report's conclusion that the lakes have no surplus water 
support his plan ``for legislative action to prevent water sales 
now and set a policy for any future sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In general, experts are concerned only about large-scale  
movement that takes water out of the Great Lakes system. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all of the water drawn out for irrigation, manufacturing  
and drinking water gets used locally and then makes its way back 
into the basin. The commission cited a 1995 statistic estimating 
that withdrawals that year amounted to 88,000 cubic feet per second 
and only 4,096 cubic feet per second was deemed to have been 
consumed, or not somehow returned to the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the lakes' entire volume (about 6 quadrillion gallons), rain  
and snow recycle only about 1 percent, Legault said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't think of the Great Lakes as a virtually bottomless  
reservoir,'' he told reporters. ``Once you go beyond that 1 
percent, you're mining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission intends to examine both surface water and ground  
water in the Great Lakes basin. 
</P>
<P>
	It plans public hearings in Milwaukee in September and in  
Buffalo, N.Y.; Detroit; Gary, Ind.; Duluth, Minn.; Washington, 
D.C.; Toronto, Ottawa, Thunder Bay, Sault Ste. Marie and London, 
Ontario; and Montreal, Quebec, in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, which helps the two nations jointly manage their  
border waters, said it has so far concluded: 
</P>
<P>
	--Taking water out of the system reduces its ability to cope with  
future stresses on the Great Lakes basin. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Great Lakes system has no water surplus, even in years with  
high water levels.

<HEADLINE> Smog and Soot Research Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A scientific advisory panel is pressing the  
Environmental Protection Agency to expand its research into the 
hazards of smog and soot despite a court ruling overturning EPA 
clear air standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever the resolution of legal proceedings, public health  
and regulatory issues concerning particulate matter will remain,'' 
the National Research Council said in its second annual report on 
research into airborne particulate matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA established regulations in 1997 to control particulates  
-- the tiniest particles of soot and smog that are thought able to 
penetrate deep into the lungs, posing a serious health risk to 
people with asthma and other breathing problems. 
</P>
<P>
	But in May, a three-judge panel overturned those standards. In a  
2-1 decision, the panel ruled the EPA lacked authority to impose 
the tougher smog rule and improperly issued new standards for soot. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has asked a full appeals court to  
reconsider the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent report by the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis said  
that while scientists still do not understand how particulates 
affect human health, ``there is a growing body of epidemiological 
evidence that suggests that such effects do exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Potential effects of exposure to particulates cited in the  
Harvard report included the possibility of lack of oxygen reaching 
the heart muscle and inflammation of the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to review the EPA'S study of particulate matter, the  
Research Council, part of the National Academy of Sciences, issued 
a report in 1998 recommending extensive research into the health 
effects. Much of that work has begun and the new report Wednesday 
is an update, suggesting additional analysis and calling for 
expanded research. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an area in which scientific uncertainties are of  
paramount importance to public policy and a promising national 
research effort to reduce those uncertainties has been initiated at 
great effort and expense,'' according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall research plan is scheduled to cover 13 years at a  
total cost of $370 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``A research program of this scope cannot be stopped and easily  
started again and any significant disruption ... might be very 
costly to the nation in public health and economic terms,'' the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The court action came in a lawsuit filed by some of the  
country's most powerful business interests, including trucking, 
auto, chemical, and oil industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 regulation that was struck down was one of the most  
controversial ever developed by EPA. It required much tougher air 
pollution controls to reduce soot and ozone levels in the air to 
ensure better protection of children, the elderly and people with 
respiratory illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The standards had limited ozone, an essential part of smog, to  
0.08 parts per million, instead of 0.12 parts per million under the 
previous requirement. Also, for the first time they required that 
states to regulate microscopic particulates, or soot, from power 
plants, cars and other sources down to 2.5 microns, or 28 times 
smaller than the width of a human hair.

<HEADLINE> Track &AMP; Field Suffers Drug Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- On the eve of the World Championships,  
track and field got the last thing it needed -- another drug 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Already reeling from a series of high-profile doping cases, the  
sport took a massive blow Wednesday with the news that one of its 
most prolific stars, sprinter Merlene Ottey, had tested positive 
for a banned steroid. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Jamaican pulled out of the championships, which  
open Saturday, after learning that traces of Nandrolone were found 
in her urine sample at a meet in Lucerne, Switzerland, on July 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Nandrolone, a performance-enhancer that goes back to the 1970s  
and has been detectable for years in conventional drug controls, 
has produced a recent rash of positive tests in track and field and 
other sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said this could be the result of more sensitive testing  
procedures or a sign that Nandrolone is being ingested unwittingly 
in other products or food supplements. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey, who has won more World Championship medals (14) than any  
other male or female athlete, said she was the victim of a 
``terrible mistake'' and would fight to prove her innocence. She 
offered to undergo another test. 
</P>
<P>
	``To write this statement has been the most difficult and  
emotionally draining experience of my life,'' Ottey said in 
announcing her withdrawal. ``I have lived my personal and athletic 
life with the utmost honesty and integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have applied only the highest ethical standards to myself  
and expect the same from others. I have always proclaimed fairness 
in sports and adamantly oppose the use of banned substances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation, the sport's world  
governing body, confirmed that Ottey's ``A'' sample turned up 
positive for Nandrolone. The backup ``B'' sample is due to be 
analyzed in the next few days at the IOC-accredited laboratory in 
Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	If the ``B'' sample is also positive, Ottey faces a possible  
two-year ban that would effectively end her career and erase her 
hopes of competing in her sixth Olympics next year in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a shock to me,'' said IAAF general secretary Istvan  
Gyulai, who was notified of the positive test earlier this week. 
``It was also a personal disaster (for Ottey). ... You can say it 
is sad, it is disappointing, that at a rather mature age, some 
athletes believe this is the way to continue at center stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey's agent, Daniel Zimmerman, said the sprinter was adamant  
that the test result was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is a strong personality that has given the sport something  
for the last 20 years and she does not want that taken away,'' he 
told BBC radio. ``She will fight this; she will get the best help 
possible from all sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1979, Ottey has been tested approximately 100 times and  
all results were negative, her management company FKG said. The 
most recent tests at Ljubjliana, May 12, and in Stockholm, July 30, 
also have shown negative results, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF and Jamaican track officials said they were upset the news  
of the positive test had leaked out before the ``B'' sample test. 
Under confidentiality rules, an athlete is not supposed to be 
identified until both samples have been analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a travesty of justice,'' Jamaican IAAF delegate Herb  
Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 10 years after Ben Johnson was stripped of his gold  
medal and world record at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, drugs are 
tarnishing the image of the sport like never before. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last month alone, Cuban high jumper Javier Sotomayor, the  
world champion and world-record holder, tested positive for cocaine 
at the Pan American Games and was stripped of his gold medal; 1992 
Olympic and world 100-meter champion Linford Christie of Britain 
was suspended for a positive Nandrolone test; and U.S. 100-meter 
champion Dennis Mitchell received a two-year ban for testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey's withdrawal came on the same day she had been scheduled  
to arrive in Seville to prepare for the 100 meters. She had 
competed at every World Championships since their inception in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey has won 34 medals in major championships, including three  
golds at the worlds. She has won seven Olympic medals -- five 
bronzes and two silvers -- but no golds. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for her glamour and grace as well as her speed, Ottey has  
been a dominant figure in the sport for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	She has dabbled in modeling and fashion design, and has been a  
roving ambassador for Jamaica. She was Jamaican sportswoman of the 
year 15 times between 1979 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a shock for all of us,'' Jamaican IAAF delegate Herb  
Elliott said. ``I've known her since she was 7 and have never known 
her to be on any substance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Ottey and Christie, those testing positive for  
Nandrolone include Britain's Doug Walker, the 1998 European 200 
champion, and the Dominican Republic's Juana Rosario Arrendel, the 
Pan American Games women's high jump gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF doping experts say the levels of Nandrolone found in the  
recent tests were too high to have been produced naturally in the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	Arne Ljungqvist, the IAAF's top anti-doping official, said the  
positive cases may indicate improved testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unlike people who are saying that the athletes are steadily  
ahead, it may be to a certain extent that we are more and more 
closing the gap,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ljungqvist said it's also possible that Nandrolone is contained  
in over-the-counter drugs or food supplements. Under IAAF rules, 
athletes are responsible for any drug found in their system, 
whether or not they took it knowingly. 
</P>
<P>
	He also some athletes who have tested positive for the drug are  
at or near the end of their careers, suggesting ``they are more 
inclined to use food supplements or other types of assistance to 
keep going.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs KKK Rally in Cleveland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A federal judge ruled today that a Ku Klux Klan  
rally may go ahead as planned, rejecting a police union's lawsuit 
complaining that the event would stretch law enforcement too 
thinly. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally is set for Saturday, on the same day a Black Family  
Expo a few blocks away is expected to draw 20,000 people, and a few 
hours before the Cleveland Browns play for the first time in their 
new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Patricia Gaughan agreed with the city's  
black mayor, Michael R. White, who says that even though he 
despises the Klan the city is legally obligated to let the white 
supremacist group speak. 
</P>
<P>
	In throwing out the suit by the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's  
Association, the judge said that even forcing the Klan to 
reschedule the rally would violate the group's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also upheld the city's plan to protect the Klan  
members' safety by letting them ride in police vehicles to a police 
garage, where they could don their white robes. 
</P>
<P>
	Police union attorneys said they would not appeal, but they  
blasted what they believe to be friendly treatment of the Klan. 
``This mayor has not fought the fight and has been a traitor to the 
cause,'' said union attorney Pat D'Angelo. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey L. Berry, national imperial wizard of the American  
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, the KKK faction that will hold the 
rally, said ``the judge upheld the Constitution for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to divert attention from the Klan rally, local  
political, religious and business leaders are promoting events 
including prayer services, a cultural festival and a basketball 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The Black Family Expo, an annual event featuring gospel and  
blues music, poetry readings and seminars on topics such as health 
and home buying, was planned long before the Klan rally. 
</P>
<P>
	The leader of the local chapter of the National Association for  
the Advancement of Colored People, George Forbes, a longtime 
political rival of White, accused the mayor of coddling the Klan. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP asked the city for a permit to hold a  
counterdemonstration, but the city rejected the request Tuesday 
because the proposed location is part of the city's detailed 
security plan for the Klan rally. The city has recommended other 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Ratner, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League,  
which tracks Klan activity, said the KKK will have a big turnout if 
it attracts 25 members. The group officially asked that up to 100 
members be allowed.

<HEADLINE> Gwen Ifill May Move to PBS Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After months of uncertainty, public television's  
``Washington Week in Review'' is talking to NBC News correspondent 
Gwen Ifill about being its new host, the Public Broadcasting 
Service confirmed today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Discussions have taken place, but there's no signed  
agreement,'' PBS spokesman Tom Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's edition of The Washington Post reported that Ifill, a  
political correspondent for NBC and a former reporter for The New 
York Times, has been offered the moderator's job as well as a role 
on PBS' ``NewsHour with Jim Lehrer'' as chief national 
correspondent. 
</P>
<P>
	She would continue at NBC in a reduced capacity, as well, at  
least for the short term, the Post said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Ifill takes over at ``Washington Week,'' where she has been a  
longtime panelist, it would bring to a close a tumultuous chapter 
for the 32-year-old public affairs program. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble began six months ago when its host, Ken Bode, was  
fired after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Bode said his dismissal arose from a desire by the  
show's producers to put ``more edge, more opinion and more 
attitude'' in the weekly show. Loyal viewers of the thoughtful, 
calm analysis program were outraged. WETA, the public television 
station that produces it, denied the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Duke, who preceded Bode as ``Washington Week'' moderator  
for 20 years, has filled in as host since February. 
</P>
<P>
	WETA had talked to Ifill about taking the job at the time of  
Bode's departure, but Ifill had rejected the idea, out of concern 
for Bode, the Post said.

<HEADLINE> Luther Campbell To Take Cops To Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Now that prosecutors have dropped aggravated  
battery charges against him, rapper Luther Campbell says he may 
take the Miami Beach police to court. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't apologize, maybe I'll sue them and get my money  
back,'' said Campbell, who estimated his legal bills at $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, whose gained notoriety as front man for 2 Live Crew,  
was arrested last month after allegedly hitting a man with a 
whiskey bottle outside a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney's office said Monday the charge was dropped  
due to conflicts among the witnesses over what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell has been arrested at least five times on gun or assault  
charges that were later either dropped or downgraded. 
</P>
<P>
	He still faces a misdemeanor domestic violence case, stemming  
from a May 8 incident at a South Beach club.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Donny Osmond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Donny Osmond started singing professionally when  
he was 5. Now, 36 years later, he looks back on his career in 
``Life Is Just What You Make It: My Story So Far,'' published this 
summer by Hyperion. 
</P>
<P>
	To the many fans who have watched him grow up, his life has been  
an open book. 
</P>
<P>
	But Osmond wants to dispel some myths.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's about time that people know the true side of my  
life because for so many years there's been a, shall we say, 
sugarcoated aura around us, around me, and after writing it, people 
come up to me and say, `I can't believe the roller coaster ride 
that you've been on in your life.' And ... it was very difficult to 
revisit some of those moments,'' he said during an interview in a 
New York hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	In the book, written with Patricia Romanowski, Osmond describes  
how he kept his Mormon faith, his dignity and his sense of humor 
through creative, emotional and financial setbacks. He also reveals 
his battle with social phobia, a debilitating anxiety disorder that 
threatened his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Social phobia, he said, ``comes from trying to be perfect, from  
ridicule, you think people are talking about you behind your 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My case is kind of interesting because it was actually  
happening. To a lot of people, it's all in their mind. Whether it's 
real or in their mind, it's still a scary proposition,'' he said. 
``It never goes away. You just have to let it go. What you do is, 
you just don't control it anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He characterizes his life as a ``survival story'' -- a story of  
``how I got through all of those years of the high pressure of show 
business.'' But, he adds: ``I had parents who were so supportive, I 
have a wife who is so supportive, I've gotten through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Osmond, who was born in Ogden, Utah, began his career as one of  
the Osmond Brothers (Alan, Wayne, Jay, Merrill), making his debut 
on ``The Andy Williams Show'' in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	He learned music from Henry Mancini and comedy from Jerry Lewis  
and Milton Berle. He cut records, including the Top 10 hit ``Puppy 
Love'' (1972), played Las Vegas, and broke the hearts of teen-age 
girls everywhere when he got married. (He and wife Debbie have been 
married for 21 years and have five sons.) 
</P>
<P>
	In their teens, Osmond and his sister Marie became a popular  
singing duo. They were hosts of a musical-variety series, ``The 
Donny and Marie Show,'' which debuted in 1976. Over the course of 
three years, they taped 68 episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	After struggling through much of the '80s to set his career on a  
new course, Osmond found success touring in Sir Andrew Lloyd 
Webber's ``Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat.'' He starred in 
1,800 shows from June 1992 until March 1998, making his final 
appearance in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, he flew to London for filming of the video, which will  
be released in Great Britain in November. (Meanwhile, Alan's sons 
are touring in ``Joseph.'') 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he teamed up with his sister for ``Donny &AMP; Marie,'' a  
syndicated daytime entertainment-talk show. Osmond commutes from 
his home in Provo, Utah, to Los Angeles, where ``Donny &AMP; Marie'' is 
taped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've committed five years to this television show, and I'm  
glad I did because it's working now. I see that relationship with 
Marie coming back now, that chemistry that we have that we had back 
in the former show. The last five months, last six months, we just 
go out there and we have the time of our lives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Osmond and his sister are scheduled to host the 79th annual Miss  
America Pageant, dubbed Miss America 2000, to be broadcast live on 
ABC-TV from Atlantic City, N.J., on Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love being in the business,'' he said. ``Can't get any  
better. Can't get any busier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	1. You write that purple socks no longer hold any special power  
over you, as you believed they did in the past. And yet the cover 
of your book is purple. Why? 
</P>
<P>
	Osmond: I did that for a reason. Because revisiting the past,  
first of all, I went through a period of time where I just didn't 
want anything to do with it. `Puppy Love,' I didn't even want to 
know about it. `Donny and Marie,' I don't want to know about it. I 
did that because it acknowledges to me that I can embrace the past 
now. It's absolutely fine. 
</P>
<P>
	2. You've had a lot of success, but your life hasn't been  
perfect. Was it hard to go back to the past and revisit all the bad 
stuff? 
</P>
<P>
	Osmond: Well, not just the bad, but the good, too.  
</P>
<P>
	3. What would you say if one of your sons said he wanted to go  
into show business? 
</P>
<P>
	Osmond: If they want to get into the business, I'll say, `Read  
my book,' because there are a lot of pitfalls they could avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Your sister is pretty feisty. How does Marie let you get away  
with putting your name first? 
</P>
<P>
	Osmond: It's in the contract. (Laughs.) No, it's been the `Donny  
and Marie' show; always will be the `Donny and Marie' show! (Still 
laughing.) 
</P>
<P>
	5. How is ``Donny &AMP; Marie'' different from your '70s show?  
</P>
<P>
	Osmond: There's really no comparison. This one, I have to say,  
I'm enjoying more than the first one, because I'm more in control. 
I'm producing the show with Marie, so we can sit down, we have a 
nice conversation with some wonderful people, yet we can still do 
what we want to do. We can sing, we have wonderful guests on the 
show, a wide variety of guests, it's turning into an entertainment 
show rather than just a straight talk show, which is what I wanted 
in the first place. And people seem to be lovin' it.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Jail Nude Picture Ban Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- When female guards in an Arizona jail  
complained that male inmates were taunting them with magazine 
centerfolds, its famously tough sheriff banned all nude pictures -- 
from Hustler to art books. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Maricopa County policy, described by the  
county's lawyer as the probably the strictest in the nation, was 
upheld by a divided 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 7-4 ruling, the court said a prohibition on pictures of  
frontal nudity was a reasonable measure to stop sexual harassment 
and improve security, and didn't violate free expression. 
Dissenters said a ban that included Michelangelo as well as Larry 
Flynt was too broad and had little to do with sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel P. Struck, a lawyer for the county and Sheriff Joseph  
Arpaio, said the ruling would ``set the standard as to what's 
allowable by prisons and jails in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arpaio has earned the nickname ``America's toughest sheriff'' --  
and criticism from civil libertarians and the Justice Department -- 
for such highly publicized moves as banning coffee and cigarettes, 
housing inmates in tents and dispatching inmates, even female 
inmates, in old-style chain gangs to cut weeds. His jail system has 
6,500 inmates serving sentences or awaiting trial, making it one of 
the largest in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban, imposed by Arpaio in 1993, extends to photos and  
drawings of frontal nudity. A lawsuit was filed in 1995 by Jonathan 
Mauro, an imate who was denied a copy of Playboy magazine while 
awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Robert Broomfield ruled in favor of the  
county, but the ruling was overturned in July 1998 by a three-judge 
appellate panel, which said the ban could be justified only if the 
county showed that any type of nude picture in jail was likely to 
cause problems. But a majority of the entire court voted to rehear 
the case before a larger panel. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday's ruling, Judge Thomas Nelson said the sheriff was  
entitled to take reasonable steps to protect guards, even if some 
innocent material also was covered by the ban. He said there was a 
clear relationship between the possession of sexually explicit 
materials and sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	In a dissent, Judge Andrew Kleinfeld there was evidence that the  
real purpose of the ban was to punish inmates, many of whom have 
not been convicted of crimes. He cited Arpaio's 1995 interview with 
Penthouse in which the sheriff said, ``when you go to jail you 
should have to give up certain things. ... Jail means punishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas Hentoff, Mauro's lawyer, could not be reached for  
comment after Tuesday's ruling. Repeated calls to him were answered 
by a message saying his voice mail system was full.

<HEADLINE> Old Sounds Fuel Moby's Modern Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The composer Moby was mildly surprised when,  
after dinner one night, a friend offered to lend him a copy of Alan 
Lomax's box set, ``Sounds of the South.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Moby parlayed his success in the techno dance music  
field into an unusually eclectic career, he had never shown any 
interest in early 20th century field recordings of 
African-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's grateful he took the discs home.  
</P>
<P>
	The music he heard provided the spark for ``Play,'' a creative  
high point and critical triumph. It was the only album released 
this year to crack the Top 20 of Spin magazine's list of the 90 
best discs of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Moby used a handful of vocals from the box set to build his own  
songs, using elements of hip-hop, blues, dance, even classical. For 
the most part, his piano and percussion provide the instrumental 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a purely technical standpoint, the fact that a lot of the  
vocals were recorded a cappella made it very easy for me to sample 
them and write songs around them,'' he explained. ``The emotional 
quality of the vocals, the way they were recorded, the cultural and 
spiritual traditions that they represent, the lyrical quality -- I 
loved everything about them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He worked alone in a small studio built next to his living room  
in a Manhattan co-op. The soundproof room is stuffed with 
electronic equipment, keyboards, guitars and a mattress. 
</P>
<P>
	The soft-spoken, 34-year-old Moby grew up as Richard Hall grew  
up in a Connecticut suburb. His parents gave him the nickname as an 
infant, telling him he was distantly related to ``Moby Dick'' 
author Herman Melville, and it stuck. 
</P>
<P>
	The dance-floor hit, ``Go,'' was his breakthrough five years  
ago. Many thought Moby would become the face to popularize a 
faceless techno movement, but his work derailed the idea. The 1997 
album, ``Animal Rights,'' was a harsh affair, a punk rock screed 
that pushed his vegan views. 
</P>
<P>
	``Play'' is, by design, more apt to capture casual listeners.  
But it's not an album the dance music world can unite behind; Moby 
describes it as a disc better suited to late Sunday afternoons than 
Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't intentionally try to confound people,'' he said. ``I  
never try to be idiosyncratic or weird or difficult. I think the 
reason I've ended up confounding some people is that they might 
have only known me for one thing, making dance music. From my 
perspective, dance music is just one small aspect of contemporary 
music that I'm interested in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He knew from age 8 that he wanted to be a musician because of  
the way music hit him emotionally. As a teen-ager, he was a punk 
rocker in the un-punk rock town of Darien, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Moby's record company contracts guarantee him creative control,  
so now he's able to pursue his diverse interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more than happy to incorporate the opinions and advice of  
people I respect about what I do,'' he said. ``But I don't want to 
be legally compelled to do that. I want to defer to my own idea of 
what my records should be like, even if in the process I make 
something that's not commercial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His music-making is done methodically, alone, in a work space  
down the hall from his living room. Moby hired musicians this 
summer to accompany him on a tour that included one of Woodstock 
'99's all-night raves. 
</P>
<P>
	The song ``Honey'' is the best example of how he uses the source  
material from Lomax's box set. He samples a four-line vocal from 
Bessie Jones that ends with this order to her honey: ``Better hop 
in the back, come on over here.'' From there, he builds a catchy, 
insistent melody around the oft-repeated vocal. Were she able to 
hear it today, Jones would probably shake her head, then tap her 
toes. 
</P>
<P>
	He considers vocals just another element of the music, so his  
songs frequently land in the middle ground between instrumentals 
and music with verses and choruses. 
</P>
<P>
	During songs where he uses his own deadpan vocals, ``Play''  
sounds similar to David Byrne and Brian Eno's ambient experiments 
of two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an indication of how the music world has opened up in the  
intervening years that ``Play'' is considered commercial. Making a 
warmer, more inviting record was one of Moby's goals after the 
admittedly self-indulgent ``Animal Rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't put on `Play' if I was having a party,'' he said.  
``It's kind of a solipsistic record. I imagine people listening to 
it while going for a long drive late at night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than in the songs, Moby uses the CD booklet to  
disseminate political views. A series of short essays are printed 
in the booklet, in which Moby explains why he's a vegetarian, says 
he's ``horrified'' at how prisoners are treated in U.S. society and 
condemns religious people who preach violence against abortion 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	The essays aren't related to the music, he writes, so it's  
possible to love the music and hate the essays, or vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows,'' he writes, ``maybe by some bizarre twist of fate  
you'll like them both.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. May Redraw 8 Congr. Districts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Democrats and civil rights groups have attacked the  
state's decision to settle a lawsuit challenging Florida 
congressional districts, denouncing a plan to alter several 
districts as a ``backroom deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, approved by lawyers for Gov. Jeb Bush, still must be  
approved by a panel of three federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would change the boundaries of seats now held by two  
black Democrats -- Alcee Hastings and Carrie Meek -- and a Hispanic 
Republican, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, along with five neighboring 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was devised to settle a lawsuit filed last year by a  
white candidate, Tom Fouts, who lost a bid for a state Senate seat 
held by a black incumbent. Under the terms of the settlement, Fouts 
dropped any challenge over state districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Meek, a lawyer for Hastings and state NAACP President Leon  
Russell said they will contest the plan at a court hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``For over a hundred years, black voters were denied voting  
rights and meaningful representation in Florida,'' Meek said. 
``This deal is a step backward, and I am concerned that 
African-Americans have a fair opportunity to compete for a seat in 
Congress in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She called the proposal ``a secret backroom deal that threatens  
to undermine the congressional representation of hundreds of 
thousands of African-American Floridians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastings' existing district ties together black neighborhoods in  
seven counties in southern Florida, yielding a black voting 
constituency of 44 percent. The proposed settlement would reduce 
that number to nearly 37 percent; in Meek's redrawn district, the 
black voting-age population would decrease from 51.3 percent to 
45.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastings' district was one of three designed to give black  
voters a better opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice 
when it was drawn by a panel of federal judges in 1992. That year, 
Florida elected its first blacks to Congress since Reconstruction: 
Corrine Brown, Meek and Hastings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. Supreme Court has since ruled that race cannot be  
the predominant factor in drawing political boundaries. That has 
forced changes in congressional and legislative districts across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Republicans emphasized that Democrats would keep safe  
seats. State Senate Majority Leader Jack Latvala of Palm Harbor, 
who was involved in the negotiations, said the goal was to draw 
compact districts for Hastings and Meek that would meet new 
requirements set by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing in this settlement that is going to change  
the makeup of these districts politically,'' Latvala said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats contend Republicans manipulated the new boundary  
lines to their advantage.

<HEADLINE> Berkeley Cafeterias Going Organic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Berkeley school kids are going granola.  
</P>
<P>
	The city's school board unanimously passed a measure Wednesday  
night designed to promote organic foods with a homegrown approach 
that encourages students to not only eat their veggies, but grow 
them, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the cafeteria to be a learning experience,'' says Tom  
Bates, a former state assemblyman who now heads the Berkeley Food 
Systems Project, which has been working with the district on the 
new food policy. 
</P>
<P>
	While many schools are trying to get more fresh fruit and  
vegetables on to their menus, Berkeley's comprehensive approach 
seemed fairly unique, said U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesman

	The new policy will start more school gardens, and incorporate  
eating, gardening and nutrition into the curriculum. A garden 
planning session, for instance, might be an opportunity for a math 
exercise calculating the area of vegetable plots. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers also will get an education in eating, with regular  
training on nutrition and agriculture.

<P>
	Although it is far-reaching, Berkeley's new plan is couched in  
terms of goals rather than edicts, phasing in organic food as it 
becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
	One immediate obstacle is price. Organic food generally is more  
expensive than conventionally grown produce, in some cases quite a 
bit more, but the school will have to work with fixed USDA lunch 
reimbursement rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Bates said costs can be kept down by dealing with local growers  
and buying in bulk.

<HEADLINE> Cartoon Doll Creates Taiwan Frenzy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Hello Kitty, a 25-year-old cartoon  
character doll whose image appears on everything from toys to 
motorcycles, has suddenly created such a public frenzy in Taiwan 
that customers have been fighting as they wait on line for 
giveaways at McDonald's.The big demand also has people lining up 
outside banks for credit cards with the little white kitten's 
picture and has sent others shopping on the black market for the 
doll. 
</P>
<P>
	Hello Kitty is a billion-dollar business for its inventor,  
Sanrio Co. of Japan, and is bringing in big sales for companies 
that put the doll on their products. 
</P>
<P>
	The allure is simple, fans say.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind all the fuss raised by the doll. I only know it  
is cute,'' said Lin Shu-chih, a secondary-school girl who snapped 
up a pair after standing in line for three hours at a McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of Hello Kitty fever has surprised many Taiwanese,  
arriving amid rising tension with China, which is denying Taiwan's 
claims to independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lovely Hello Kitty doll helps us relax a little,'' said  
Chou Nien-yung, a manager at Makoto Bank, which helped the craze 
spread into Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Others suggest the frenzy may be due to rising stress levels as  
the Taiwanese become more prosperous but work harder. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's more to the story than any Taiwanese angst. Hello  
Kitty is booming across Asia, with big sales in the United States 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's, expecting to capitalize on Hello Kitty's popularity,  
selected the doll for promotions in its Asian and Pacific outlets 
this year. Makoto Bank began printing the doll on checkbooks and 
credit cards in an attempt to change the stiff and aloof image of 
Taiwanese financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, lines of new depositors were so long outside  
Makoto's 50 branches that some passersby worried there was a run on 
the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Hello Kitty brought Sanrio more than $1.1 billion in revenues  
from the doll and related products for the fiscal year ending in 
March. Exports came to $70 million, an 11.9 percent increase, with 
the biggest overseas sales from the 200 U.S. retail outlets that 
sell Hello Kitty merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanrio's annual dividend to shareholders is rising by two-thirds  
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The doll has become a marketing vehicle for bread, tofu dishes,  
pins, gold necklaces, telephones and just about anything else 
manufacturers can think of. 
</P>
<P>
	Hello Kitty had been targeted solely at children until about  
three years ago when Sanrio found a new market: Women drawn to 
products that looked more feminine. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales soared as customers rushed to buy the dolls and anything  
imprinted with the cat. But while people are running to get the 
merchandise, they're not always polite about it. 
</P>
<P>
	After McDonald's started selling Hello Kitty dolls in Taiwan,  
impatient customers standing in long lines got into fights. One 
McDonald's outlet in a museum was ordered to close temporarily 
because of the chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of dolls of Hello Kitty and Dear Daniel, her boyfriend,  
can fetch up to $74 on the black market, or 10 times the original 
price. And counterfeits have been turning up. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses selling Hello Kitty merchandise are thrilled with  
their sales, but some Taiwanese are wary about a cultural invasion 
by a Japanese firm. And they question how Taiwan has deteriorated 
from a hot spot of toymaking 10 years ago to one engulfed by 
imported dolls. 
</P>
<P>
	The China Times said the craze could stifle Taiwan's creativity.  
</P>
<P>
	``If a simple white kitty can drive everyone crazy, why do we  
need to make any efforts to create other products?'' the newspaper 
asked.

<HEADLINE> CB Mark Collins Retires From Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Mark Collins, a cornerback on the New York  
Giants' two Super Bowl championship teams, announced his retirement 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, who played nine games with Seattle last season,  
re-signed with the Giants earlier this week so he could end his 
13-year career with his original team. 
</P>
<P>
	A second-round draft pick out of Cal State-Fullerton in 1986,  
Collins played eight seasons with the Giants. He started on both 
their Super Bowl teams and was in the starting lineup for 104 of 
his 112 games with New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins also played three seasons with Kansas City and one  
apiece with Green Bay and Seattle. In 168 career games, he had 749 
tackles, 27 interceptions and three touchdowns, two on 
interceptions and one on a fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins is the third member of the Super Bowl teams who  
re-signed to retire as a Giant. Center Bart Oates and defensive 
tackle Leonard Marshall also did.

<HEADLINE> Pavement Takes Profile Up a Notch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While Pavement's new record ``Terror Twilight''  
won't likely bring it superstar status, the album is certainly the 
inconspicuous band's most serious attempt to cultivate its 
fragmented and ``low-fi'' approach to music. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had done all these other records just kind of haphazardly.  
... An out-of-time drum take here or an out-of-tune guitar there,'' 
said guitarist Scott Kannberg in an interview during Pavement's 
summer tour. 
</P>
<P>
	For ``Terror Twilight,'' the band decided to ``spend a few more  
bucks,'' Kannberg said, to make sure there would be no mistakes to 
regret later. 
</P>
<P>
	Producer Nigel Godrich, who has worked with R.E.M., Beck and  
Radiohead, was brought in to help shape the band's indiscriminate 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't looking for something radio-friendly or  
MTV-friendly, just a sound with a little more cohesiveness and 
better in a classic rock way,'' Kannberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Working with an outside producer for the first time presented  
some awkward moments in the studio for the usually self-reliant 
band. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, while working on the album's closing sequence,  
Godrich ``tried to push his producer power on us and we were like 
`nope,''' Kannberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was totally noncommercial. He had slow songs first and the  
pop songs at the very end. That's fine, but I don't want it to be 
boring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pavement's attention to detail on ``Terror Twilight'' runs  
contrary to the band's previous disdain for improvement or 
accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of the Pavement mystique is this band that doesn't really  
know how to play its instruments and is kind of stumbling along 
through its songs,'' Kannberg said. After a decade together, 
``we're still that way, but at least we have gotten more proficient 
on our instruments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, the band has been hesitant to fully expose its knack  
for writing engaging and lyrically smart pop songs, choosing to 
bury its catchy melodies beneath layers of dissonance, unusual 
chord progressions and off-key singing. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Pavement seems willing to take its profile to a higher  
level, ``Steve would never go on television and act like a rock 
star,'' said Kannberg, referring to singer Stephen Malkmus. 
</P>
<P>
	Kannberg and Malkmus got together in Stockton, Calif., in 1988.  
They released a series of self-produced EPs, which eventually led 
to a debut album on the independent Matador Records label in 1992. 
Wary of allowing their ``musical project'' to graduate to a band, 
they kept their identities hidden behind their respective aliases, 
Spiral Stairs and S.M. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavement was well-received by the alternative music press, which  
dubbed the music ``low-fi.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Success remains Pavement's own private joke. The band has a  
reputation for snubbing the media, musical contemporaries and 
opportunities for mainstream acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
	While the band has had opportunities to capitalize on its  
underground popularity, Pavement has always fallen short because 
Kannberg and Malkmus just never tried very hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all luck and the amount of work you put in,'' Kannberg  
said. ``The Smashing Pumpkins are willing to go on the road for two 
years. We're willing to go on the road for nine months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kannberg prefers a less rigorous life at home with his wife in  
California. For him, spending time on the golf course is much more 
appealing than living on a tour bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Percussionist Bob Nastanovich prefers spending his time away  
from the band tending his horses. His house sits across from 
Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., and his horses have competed in 
preliminary races at the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Nastanovich and his bandmates attended this year's Derby while  
rehearsing at his house for their summer tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Bob's one thing he looks forward to every year -- this  
race,'' Kannberg said.

<HEADLINE> Morgan Stanley Analyst Sues Broker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A second Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst is  
alleging that the prominent firm discriminated against him because 
he is black. 
</P>
<P>
	The $35 million lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in  
Manhattan, comes a month after state prosecutors concluded that the 
firm used poor judgment but broke no laws when it dismissed 
Christian Curry, who filed an earlier lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry sued the company in May for $1.35 billion, saying he was  
fired in April 1998 because he is black and because nude photos of 
him had appeared in a gay men's magazine. Morgan Stanley said he 
was fired for expense account abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the most recent lawsuit, Alan Damon Harvey said he was  
treated differently than non-black employees when he worked for the 
company as a financial analyst in its real estate department from 
July 1997 to May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Wednesday, Morgan Stanley said: ``We believe that  
the allegations in Damon Harvey's suit have no merit. We do not 
tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind and we did not 
discriminate or harass Mr. Harvey in any way during his employment. 
We plan to demonstrate these facts in court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said Harvey was one of six black financial analysts  
out of a total of more than 200 analysts worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was humiliated and suffered mentally and emotionally  
from constant treatment that differed from the treatment of his 
white colleagues and from the use of disparaging racial references 
and stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
	The severe physical shock and anguish resulted in Harvey  
suffering a nervous breakdown in May 1998, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the winter of 1997, he was told to watch a videotape from the  
previous year's Christmas party in which one skit making fun of a 
black manager with the firm featured a man dressed in an ``afro'' 
wig with enlarged lips and a pillow in his shirt, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said white supervisors seeking black employees would  
ask, ``Where's your boy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also said a supervisor once asked two black employees as all  
three men studied a menu if they planned to order fried chicken.

<HEADLINE> Deion Sanders' Return Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Deion Sanders can run forward and  
backward as fast as he wants for as long as he wants. It's making 
the cuts necessary to play cornerback that are keeping the All-Pro 
on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said Wednesday that despite his efforts to rehabilitate  
his injured left big toe, he still doesn't know when it will be 
strong enough for him to return to the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything a cornerback does is on the toes,'' said Sanders,  
who was wearing open-toed sandals with two strips of tape holding a 
foam wedge in place between the injured toe and the next one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to really try my best to turn it on up in the next  
few weeks, a little bit at a time. Right now, it's tremendous pain 
to push off on, plant -- and that's my whole game, reaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A severe case of turf toe kept Sanders out of the final five  
games of last season, although he returned for a first-round 
playoff loss in January and the Pro Bowl in February. He then had 
the toe surgically repaired in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of his rehabilitation is for the left big toe to be as  
strong as the right one. Doctors have told him that might not 
happen for as long as six months after the operation, which would 
be October. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say it's better, worse,'' Sanders said. ``I can say  
it's getting better all the time, but I can't really tell that 
until I really turn it up another level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders refused to give a timetable for his return and was  
protective of the details of his recovery regimen. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he did seem to have fun discussing both subjects, even  
turning the topic of his return into a lively guessing game. 
</P>
<P>
	When told that trainer Jim Maurer said Tuesday he's aiming for  
Sanders to be back for the Sept. 12 opener against Washington, 
Sanders raised his eyebrows and said: ``Yeah? On the sideline? 
Coaching?'' 
</P>
<P>
	When reminded that Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has said Sanders  
could be back by October, Sanders said: ``I would think people must 
confer with me before speaking their goals.'' He then cackled and 
added, ``My goal is just whatever the Lord will have me to do, 
brother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Sanders has a financial incentive to return  
quickly. If he plays 70 percent of Dallas' defensive snaps and 
makes the Pro Bowl, he'll get a $1.5 million bonus. He's already 
made $3.5 million in bonuses and he has a $3 million base salary as 
part of a five-year deal that pays him the highest annual salary 
($10.5 million a year) in league history. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was skipping rope on the sidelines Wednesday and said he  
runs every morning. He's also been riding a bicycle around the 
Midwestern State University campus, but that's as much 
transportation as rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders vowed that when he returns he'll be available at  
cornerback and punt returner. He didn't mention wide receiver, but 
he was wearing a Cowboys cap that belongs to Tommie Robinson, an 
assistant receivers coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to come back just the way I left,'' he said. ``I  
don't want limitations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All this time off has given Sanders plenty of time to think, and  
he admits he's thought about the day when his career will be over. 
He said he's convinced his strong faith -- and a strong bank account 
-- will help him handle it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it isn't His will for me to come back this year or to play  
any more, I'm fine -- financially, mentally, physically and 
spiritually,'' said Sanders, who in May married actress-model Pilar 
Biggers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm praying that He allows me to come back this year. But if  
not, I'm fine.''

<HEADLINE> Global Temp Co. Adecco Buys Olsten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consolidation in the global temporary staffing  
industry continued Wednesday as worldwide leader Adecco SA 
purchased the staffing operations of Olsten Corp., one of the top 
firms in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Adecco, based in Switzerland, said it will pay about $710  
million for Olsten's general and information technology staffing 
businesses, or about $8.75 a share, and assume $750 million worth 
of Olsten's debts. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, the Melville, N.Y.-based Olsten will spin  
off its health care services business into a new publicly traded 
company. The new firm will be headed by current Olsten president 
and chief executive Ed Blechschmidt and continue to provide home 
nursing services. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Marcon, senior equity analyst at First Union Capital  
Markets in Richmond, Va., said consolidation among the top global 
temporary staffing companies is likely to continue over the next 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 4,000 temporary staffing companies in the U.S.  
alone, which makes the $63 billion industry ripe for acquisitions 
by the bigger players, said Marcon. ``The deals just keep getting 
larger and larger and more strategic in nature. This is an early 
part of that overall trend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olsten operates more than 1,000 offices in 14 countries. Prior  
to the purchase, Adecco operated 3,200 offices in 52 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Current Olsten shareholders will receive shares in the new  
health services company, as well as cash and Adecco shares traded 
in the United States, known as American depositary receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal must be approved by Adecco's shareholders, who will  
meet Sept. 10 to vote on the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsten's health care business, which had been under  
investigation by the Justice Department over allegations of 
Medicare fraud, agreed last month to pay $61 million to settle the 
charges. Olsten will pay nearly $51 million in a civil settlement, 
and its subsidiary, Kimberly Home Health Care, Inc., agreed to pay 
$10 million in criminal fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Olsten rose 25 cents to $9.75 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. Trading in Adecco was suspended on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Tokyo Stocks Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar fell to a six-month low against the  
yen Wednesday amid fading expectations Japan will intervene in 
financial markets to halt a potentially damaging rise in its 
currency. Stock prices rose for the eighth-straight session. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading at 113.08 yen in late afternoon trading,  
down 1.52 yen from its level late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its 
overnight level in New York of 114.05 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the dollar was lower late in Tokyo was Feb. 5 when  
it was traded at 112.06 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 32.17 points, or 0.18  
percent, to close at 17,892.26. On Tuesday, the average rose 34.06 
points, or 0.19 percent, to finish at 17,860.09. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has been slowly strengthening in recent months against  
the dollar on optimism that Japan's long-battered economy was 
beginning to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	But Japanese finance officials have long maintained that a  
sudden surge in the yen could hurt Japan's giant exporters and have 
intervened in markets to keep the yen low and those companies 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen hurts exporters by making their products more  
expensive overseas and reducing the value of their earnings in 
those markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, though, they have mostly stayed out of the  
market. On Tuesday, Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami said 
targeting of specific exchange rates wasn't a good idea and warned 
Japanese corporations to prepare for a stronger yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically the BOJ should not intervene now because the yen's  
strengthening is reflecting Japan's economic fundamentals,'' said 
Kazuki Fujita, a senior foreign exchange analyst at the Industrial 
Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar fell as low as 113.00 yen in Asian trading  
Wednesday and rose as high as 114.30 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	As the dollar continued to fall Wednesday, senior Japanese  
finance official Haruhiko Kuroda said that the yen's strengthening 
is undesirable and Japan is ready to take decisive action to curb 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``A premature yen rise is detrimental not only to the Japanese  
economy, but also to the global economy,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders said his remarks had little impact.  
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 119.30 yen, down  
from 120.66 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo stock exchange, the Nikkei rose slightly on strong  
gains by a few select blue chip shares. But many traders doubted 
the rally would last. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that only a limited group of issues have gained in  
recent sessions overshadows upside prospects for the overall 
market,'' said Masatoshi Sato, manager of investment information at 
Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 4.29 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,478.43. The 
TOPIX added 5.63 points, or 0.38 percent, to close at 1,474.14 the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 501.86  
million shares, up from 387.00 million shares Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But declines far outnumbered rises by 769 to 394, while 150  
issues finished unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders attributed much of the increase in trading volume to a  
reshuffle in Morgan Stanley Capital International's Standard Index 
for Japan, which was announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley announced 30 additions and 39 deletions to its  
Japan index, prompting many fund managers and speculators to buy 
the new additions and sell off the deletions, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.9400 percent from Tuesday's close of 1.9300 percent, 
nudging its price down to 98.81 yen from 98.90 yen.

<HEADLINE> MetLife Settles Class-Action Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., the nation's  
No. 2 insurer, has agreed to pay at least $1.7 billion to settle 
allegations it engaged in deceptive sales practices involving 
individual life insurance policies and annuity contracts and 
certificates. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed agreement announced Wednesday covers approximately  
seven million current and former policyholders and annuity 
contractholders who purchased MetLife products between 1982 and 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The class-action settlement requires approval by the U.S.  
District Court in Pittsburgh. A hearing has been set for Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``This settlement provides a fair resolution to issues that have  
been the subject of protracted litigation and that have affected 
much of our industry,'' Robert H. Benmosche, chairman and chief 
executive officer of MetLife said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Melvyn L. Weiss, co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said the  
settlement is one of several in recent years involving 
reimbursement for alleged deceptive insurance sales practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The main allegations include:  
</P>
<P>
	--A practice known as ``churning,'' in which an agent sells a  
customer a new, larger policy using the cash value of an existing 
policy to purchase it. When the cash value of the old policy is 
exhausted, the customer must pay the larger premium or let the 
policy lapse. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sales of policies with so-called ``vanishing premiums.''  
Customers were told that after a certain number of years, they 
would not have to pay their premium anymore, but in some cases that 
never happened. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Insurance policies were portrayed as investment products but  
didn't earn the kind of money that customers believed they would 
for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	MetLife paid a $25 million fine in Tampa, Fla. and an $800,000  
fine in Connecticut over similar allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	MetLife plans to mail information about the settlement to about  
4 million current and 3 million former customers beginning Aug. 27. 
A toll free number will be available at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``These practices were common in the industry since the early  
'80s. MetLife was not alone,'' Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prudential Insurance Co. of America has already paid $70 million  
in penalties and set aside $2.6 billion to pay policyholders who 
sued over similar sales practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar industry settlements have prompted widespread changes in  
terms of insurance industry policies and practices are perceived, 
Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators are continuing investigations into MetLife's  
practices in Florida and Massachusetts.

<HEADLINE> Neighbors Snitch During Droughts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- It used to be that a healthy lawn  
would keep you in good standing with the neighbors. In the 
drought-stricken Northeast, having a lush lawn these days might 
bring a visit from the police. 
</P>
<P>
	Since water restrictions went into effect in Maryland, Delaware,  
New Jersey and Pennsylvania this summer, calls have poured into 
police and public works departments from citizens complaining of 
water wasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Most calls are variations on a couple of themes: My neighbors'  
grass is TOO green. And their car is TOO shiny. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman in Queen Anne's County asked if it was legal for her  
neighbor to collect condensation dripping off her air conditioner 
for sprinkling her plants. (It's legal.) 
</P>
<P>
	In suburban Washington, police investigated neighbor complaints  
of a man washing his car and found him dousing the lime-green 
Mercedes with bottled water. (Expensive, but legal.) 
</P>
<P>
	One caller in Maryland asked if there was a reward for turning  
in scofflaws. (No, sorry.) 
</P>
<P>
	In some areas, police radios even ring out with reports of  
``woman watering lawn'' and ``someone washing car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most people figure that ``if their lawns are going to have to  
die, all the lawns in their neighborhood are going to die,'' said 
Officer Richard Krause of Upper Makefield, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The region's worst drought in a century is killing crops and  
turning lawns brown in Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey 
and parts of Virginia and New England. Rainfall is down by 18 
inches in some areas over the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	A drought enforcement hot line in Delaware last week received  
more than 2,200 calls. Since Aug. 5, the Fair Lawn, N.J., Police 
Department has gotten more than 100 calls from people reporting 
violations. Most have been anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also are being dragged into personal disputes. One couple  
on Maryland's Eastern Shore reported a neighbor for watering the 
grass -- and added that they hadn't been invited to the neighbor's 
Christmas party. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ellicott City, a prosperous Baltimore suburb where the lawns  
are burned out, resident Bill Blair said he would confront the 
water waster himself instead of calling police. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if she'd snitch on a neighbor, Rosemarie Joyce gasped. ``I  
can't imagine anybody doing that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dana Shillingburg said he wouldn't hesitate to call  
authorities about a water-wasting neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I saw them do it two or three times, I'd probably make a  
phone call,'' he said. ``We have a pretty severe water problem 
around here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most police and public works departments say they are letting  
first-time offenders off with a warning. But one man in Upper 
Makefield was fined $300 after police twice found his automatic 
sprinkler watering a $6,000 bed of flowers and other plants. And 
police in Delaware temporarily shut off the water at the home of 
one repeat offender who wouldn't stop watering his lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some exceptions, but not everyone knows. For example,  
it's OK to water flowers from a watering can or hand-held hose. 
</P>
<P>
	Rickie Martinez said he was confronted by a passing motorist as  
he watered his geraniums. 
</P>
<P>
	``A guy stopped and said, `Hey you can't do that, sir,' and I  
told him, `I think you'll find that I can,''' Martinez recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	The water restrictions have reduced consumption considerably. In  
Maryland, water use has dropped 14 percent compared with last 
year's figures for early August. In Pennsylvania, it's down 10 
percent to 20 percent in some areas. New Jersey's largest water 
utility reported last week that consumption is down as much as 39 
percent in some places. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzanne Smith of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland  
said the use of hot lines to rat on neighbors ``feels a little 
creepy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But on the other hand, they do it in all kinds of contexts.  
You're supposed to report child abuse,'' she said. ``It would be 
much more problematic if you could call in and that was sufficient 
to get a citation issued.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Morrill, Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening's spokesman, said  
the governor was hoping that folks would talk to one another before 
calling the cops. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted this to be friendly,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cards Waive Receiver, Sign Tackle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals waived wide  
receiver Ronnie Anderson on Wednesday and signed offensive tackle 
Todd Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson appeared in four games for the Cardinals late last  
season, primarily on special teams. He was with Green Bay in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 6-foot-5 and 290 pounds, started 34 consecutive games  
for the University of California from 1994 to 1996. He was on the 
Carolina Panthers' practice squad in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals are short on offensive linemen because of injuries  
to Chris Dishman, Lester Holmes and Ernest Dye, as well as lesser 
injuries to several other players. Dishman is out with arthroscopic 
elbow surgery. Holmes and Dye were injured in an auto accident on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye's arm was crushed, likely ending his playing career. Holmes,  
who was driving the car, had severe facial cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Vince Tobin also said defensive end Andre Wadsworth won't  
play in Friday night's preseason game against Tennessee at Sun 
Devil Stadium. Wadsworth has been bothered by a sore knee 
throughout training camp. Defensive back Aeneas Williams also 
probably won't play, Tobin said. Williams is bothered by a sore 
neck and shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Ottis will likely start in place of Wadsworth. Tommy Knight  
will start in Williams.

<HEADLINE> Farmer's Internet Use Jumps / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- Before Lyle Samuelson hits the fields each  
morning, he hits the Internet. Sitting at his computer desk with a 
cup of coffee, the Sarles farmer logs on and checks the latest crop 
reports, weather forecasts and commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting information this way is so much easier,'' he said.  
``It's something you can sit and do early in the morning, and it 
only takes a few minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samuelson is among a growing number of farmers who find  
computers and Internet access to be an important part of farming. 
He has even started selling computers in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1997 to 1999, the percentage of farmers nationwide with  
access to the Internet more than doubled -- from just 13 percent to 
29 percent, according to a June survey by the Agriculture 
Department's Agricultural Statistics Service. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Dakota, the figure increased from 11 percent to 32  
percent, with an equal number saying they use their computers and 
the Internet regularly in their farm operation. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Dakota, 29 percent of farmers had Internet access,  
compared with 38 percent in Montana and 27 percent in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	For many, it is becoming a primary source for sharing and  
gathering information and even for purchasing products ranging from 
chemicals and fertilizers to tractors and combines. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of farmers out there have e-mail now, and it certainly  
makes it a very easy and useful way of exchanging information,'' 
said Tim Bryan, a fourth-generation farmer near the small town of 
Bowbells. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan has used computers in his operation for about a decade, at  
first mostly for bookkeeping purposes. He signed on to the Internet 
only about three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're always seeking information, whether it's on new crop  
varieties or access to certain chemicals we need,'' he said. ``The 
Internet is a way to keep connected and keep track of trends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samuelson said other farmers make up about 30 percent of his  
customer list for computer sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people like the idea that they can look at the  
markets on the Internet every morning,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recognizing the growing popularity of the Internet among  
farmers, the North Dakota State University Extension Service, the 
state Agriculture Department and many manufacturers and suppliers 
have for years posted much of their information on Internet web 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington led all states in the percentage of farmers with  
Internet access at 50 percent, up from 20 percent in 1997. In 
Kentucky, just 14 percent of farmers had access to the Internet, 
according to USDA statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ABBEVILLE, La. (AP) -- Extremely low rice prices caused by a  
worldwide glut have some farmers thinking of getting out of 
farming. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 attended a meeting here this week during which  
experts held out bleak prospects for prices getting better and 
provided information on how to get out of the business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to cry wolf, but at these prices, the wolf is at  
the door,'' Vermilion Parish county agent Howard Cormier told the 
overflow crowd, some of whom came straight from the rice fields. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU farm management expert Gerald Giesler provided advice on how  
to negotiate with financial institutions, terminate land lease 
agreements and seek protection under bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU Agriculture Center economists said rice price estimates for  
this year's crops are less than $8 per 100 pounds, a huge drop from 
prices that reached $17 last year for the same amount.

<HEADLINE> PGA Championship Sees Stellar Shots  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It was a remarkable shot -- a play drawn in the dirt that worked  
-- that Sergio Garcia pulled off in the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball's lie was between two tree roots, putting the  
19-year-old Spaniard in deep trouble on the 16th fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	Then with one eyes-closed swing, the ball was on the green, and  
the running, jumping Garcia was still in the title hunt. He was 
only a stroke behind Tiger Woods, and suddenly, the gallery was 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	A celebrity was born.  
</P>
<P>
	It was only an 8-foot putt for par, but it might have been the  
most important putt to date in the lucrative and sometimes 
overhyped career of the 23-year-old Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the putt of a champion.  
</P>
<P>
	The great ones suck it up and find a way to win when things  
aren't going well for them. And things definitely were going wrong 
for Woods, who was five shots ahead after 12 holes and was only one 
shot in front as he prepared take the 8-footer on 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The tiger came out of the Tiger.  
</P>
<P>
	One admiring television viewer -- how else do you watch a golf  
tournament if you want to see anything? -- for some reason thought 
of Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali needed to win the 12th and final round to win his rematch  
against Ken Norton on Sept. 10, 1973. On March 31, Norton had 
broken Ali's jaw in winning a 12-round decision. 
</P>
<P>
	A second straight loss by Ali most likely would have changed  
drastically the course of heavyweight boxing history. Ali won the 
round and went on to add significantly to his legend. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, barring the unforeseen, would seem to have many more wins  
and many more years in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	It is interesting, however, to speculate on how a loss might  
have affected him at this stage. A defeat would have been a 
collapse. ``Choke'' would have been spoken and written. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, like Ali, saw pressure as just another obstacle to  
overcome -- and did. His 12-stroke victory in the Masters in 1997 
was made of gold. His PGA Championship win was constructed of 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the exuberant Garcia, he was a breath of fresh air in a  
sport whose competitors often appear dour. The duel also swung many 
in the gallery from rooting for Woods to rooting for the Spaniard, 
to the point that some people hurled taunts at Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	How ungallery like. Spectators at a golf tournament apparently  
are called a gallery because they're expected to be quiet, as if 
they were in a museum. 
</P>
<P>
	By the way, why do people go to golf tournaments? It must be to  
get the exercise, because very few get to see much of the action. 
People watch a player tee off and shout ``aaahhh'' when the ball is 
hit, then tramp to next hole and go ``ooohhh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Television definitely is needed for golf. It enables one to doze  
off in a soft chair, but it must be admitted that Sergio and Tiger 
kept a lot of weekend nappers wide awake.

<HEADLINE> Employers Use Transcripts for Hires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Youngsters seeking work at more than 10,000  
businesses, from McDonald's to IBM, are finding they cannot hide 
from a spotty academic career: Their high school records are being 
requested by companies worried that poor grades and lax attendance 
may suggest an employment risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospective employers hope they're sending a message to high  
school students and recent graduates that school performance and 
their commitment to learning matter -- even in today's job market, 
where employers are crying for help. 
</P>
<P>
	``We let standards go down over the years; it's time to get them  
back to where they used to be,'' said John Wentling, the general 
manager of a McDonald's restaurant in Dover, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	Wentling is a participant in a campaign by the National Alliance  
of Businesses to encourage employers to study high school records 
when hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	One applicant this summer did not get a job after Wentling's  
check of the school records showed the applicant missed 12 days of 
school and was late 37 times. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our profession, we have to schedule according to hourly  
needs,'' said Wentling, who has about 70 employees. ``We need to 
pick someone reliable, dependable and professional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-year-old ``Making Academics Counts'' campaign grew out  
of discussions among business and education groups; they both 
wanted to produce better students who can continue their education, 
and make themselves more attractive to potential employers. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance, which started out with about 2,000 participants,  
reached its goal of 10,000 this month, the group said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	High school transcripts vary by district, or even school, but  
most usually include students' grades, attendance history, course 
work and teacher evaluations. Transcripts always have helped 
students get into college but were used less often for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes parents and students can be reluctant to give  
permission for the records' release because they worry employers 
will use the information on gender, race, disability and the like 
as an excuse to deny a job application. 
</P>
<P>
	However, business leaders facing shortages of skilled  
entry-level workers began to complain that students were graduating 
from high school without the skills -- particularly in technology -- 
necessary for today's workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were days when I could get a manufacturing job with  
reading, writing and basic arithmetic,'' said Robin Willner, IBM's 
director of corporate social policy. ``Those days are over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	International Business Machines Corp., based in Armonk, N.Y.,  
asks for high school transcripts at all of the company's 
manufacturing facilities, which are in California, Minnesota, New 
York, North Carolina, Texas and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 percent of the company's 296,000 employees are in  
manufacturing and development. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers have not always cared to delve too deeply into  
entry-level applicants' school records. As recently as 1995, a 
federal education study found that employers ranked grades and 
school performance well down on the list of qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
	About 36 percent of high school graduates do not go straight to  
college, even though a college graduate's earning power over a 
lifetime is nearly twice that of a high school grad. Also, many 
students, unless they were college-bound, felt school performance 
and attendance counted for very little, said IBM's Willner. 
</P>
<P>
	However, production line managers prefer workers who have taken  
math courses such as algebra and statistics because they stand a 
better chance of figuring out increasingly complex quality-control 
measures at the plants, Willner said. Students who have had a lab 
science such as chemistry tend to do better with hands-on work, she 
added.

<HEADLINE> Development Angers in Steinbeck Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEREY, Calif. (AP) -- Developer Dan Summers eyes the  
rubble-strewn lot along historic Cannery Row and sees it filled 
with dozens of new shops, restaurants and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
	His vision isn't popular among locals and conservationists who  
want to make sure the people and places John Steinbeck wrote about 
don't go out with the tide. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't come to Cannery Row to buy a pair of jeans at The  
Gap,'' said Molly Erickson, a fourth generation Monterey resident. 
``They come to experience our unique history and our natural 
beauty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say a $50 million plan to build dozens of new shops,  
restaurants and condominiums just yards from where the crumbling 
foundations of canneries meet the Monterey Bay will destroy the 
city's cultural heritage and create terrible traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers, one of three Palo Alto-based partners behind the  
Cannery Row Marketplace plan, says development will fill a blighted 
gap in the area and bring new jobs and $700,000 a year in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The City Council will hold hearings on the proposal and is  
scheduled to decide Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The single remaining structure on the site is the former  
Stohan's gift gallery, which in Steinbeck's era served as a 
reduction plant where inedible fish parts were turned into 
fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Stohan's is one of the last vestiges of the extensive canning  
industry that made Monterey the ``sardine capital of the world'' 
early in the 20th century. The vibrant, bustling industry supported 
by immigrant labor has since been replaced by the Monterey Bay 
Aquarium and blocks of tourist stores and restaurants that draw 
close to 2 million visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of this commercial district sits the blighted,  
vacant block. ``Clearly this spot is a black eye for the city of 
Monterey,'' Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers and his partners bought the 3.5 acre site in 1997 for  
about $6 million. They sold two newer buildings on one end for 
about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The project calls for Stohan's to be moved and rebuilt into a  
small cannery museum. The rest of their development would include 
four large buildings with 115,000 square feet of stores and 
restaurants, 47 condominiums and rental units, a plaza overlooking 
the Monterey Bay and 613 parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big development, yes, but when you look at the history  
of Cannery Row, all the buildings used to be big,'' said Doug 
Thompson, chairman of the board of the Monterey Peninsula Chamber 
of Commerce who has been hired by Summers to handle public 
relations on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said opponents to the project ``are the locals who are  
opposed to every project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monterey residents aren't the only ones concerned.  
</P>
<P>
	The National Trust for Historic Preservation included Cannery  
Row on its list of ``Eleven Most Endangered Historic Places'' last 
year. And the Monterey County Herald's editorial page recently 
declared that the City Council ``should find a way to say no to the 
Cannery Row Marketplace without hindering the city's future 
options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbeck's heirs also have weighed in.  
</P>
<P>
	The author's son, Thomas Steinbeck, says his father would have  
welcomed the development idea. But Nancy Steinbeck, widow of the 
author's son John Steinbeck IV, told the city council that her 
husband ``often told me Steinbeck disliked the tourist traps that 
had sprung up to commercialize Cannery Row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal has been rejected by the city's Planning Commission  
and is opposed by Chief of Planning Bill Fell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cannery Row is a very significant site for this city,'' he  
said. ``Do we redevelop it with sardine canneries? Probably not, 
because there are very few sardines left to harvest. But we don't 
forget the history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strolling next to a chain link fence surrounding the site,  
tourist Linda Royer of Oregon City, Ore., said the property ``looks 
devastated,'' but she would hate to see more shops and restaurants 
built there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've already been really disappointed by the tackiness,'' she  
said, pointing toward the souvenir and T-shirt shops next to the 
aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
	``My preference would be to see the old wooden cannery buildings  
here, some gardens, and more opportunity to look out at the 
water.''

<HEADLINE> Detroit Crime Down, Except Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The city's murder rate, already among the highest  
in the nation, jumped 16.7 percent in the first half of 1999 -- 
baffling city leaders who have watched a decline in the number of 
other serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The city recorded 57,736 serious crimes from January through  
June, a 15.8 percent drop over the same period a year ago. The 
largest drop came in larcenies, which were down 25.5 percent, while 
assaults, auto thefts, burglaries, rapes and robberies also 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
	But murders increased to 224. Mayor Dennis Archer and Police  
Chief Benny Napoleon said they were concerned because there was no 
clear cause and no obvious solution. The murder rate in the city of 
1 million dropped last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we had sufficient police officers that we could put an  
officer on every corner of the streets where we live,'' Archer said 
Wednesday. ``The reality is that the homicides that are taking 
place are taking place behind closed doors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit's murder rate still ranks among the highest in the  
country. In 1998 Detroit had 429 murders, or 44.2 per 100,000 
people, ranking it sixth among U.S. cities with more than 100,000 
residents. In recent years, murder has been the leading cause of 
death among children and young adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Crime has been a sore spot for Detroit leaders for many years.  
Safety was often cited as a cause of flight to the suburbs; poverty 
and drugs were blamed for driving crime rates up. 
</P>
<P>
	Making people feel safe was one of Archer's prime goals when he  
took office in 1994, and since then Detroit's crime rate has gone 
down, mirroring a national trend.

<HEADLINE> Berkeley Cafeterias Going Organic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Forget about mystery meat. Berkeley's  
school cafeterias are going organic. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's school board is expected to approve a plan today that  
would give students the option of munching on pesticide-free baby 
carrots and sandwiches made with organic bread. 
</P>
<P>
	The food would be grown in school gardens and purchased from  
local organic farmers. Milk would be certified clean of bovine 
growth hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's pretty rare -- and pretty expensive -- but Berkeley is an  
unusual place,'' said Rick DeBurgh, who added that he has never 
heard of schools serving organic cafeteria fare in his 22 years 
with the California School Food Services Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa Monica has experimented with a farmer's market salad bar,  
but Berkeley wants to serve organic foods in the main dishes and 
after-school snacks. The plan also calls for removing irradiated 
and genetically altered foods. 
</P>
<P>
	The new menu is intended to emphasize healthy eating habits and  
teach students where their food comes from. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most kids don't even know what organic means,'' said Berkeley  
High School junior Coriale Areceneaux.

<HEADLINE> Ex-NJ Trooper of Year Gets Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The 1997 Trooper of the Year was  
sentenced to five years' probation Wednesday for shaking down 
motorists on the New Jersey Turnpike. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge scolded Francis M. Burke, 31, for trashing his career  
for ``a few dollars here, a few dollars there'' and ordered him to 
undergo psychiatric counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the five-year veteran told two motorists in  
1998 he wouldn't ticket them for driving with revoked licenses if 
they paid him for a tow truck he said had been sent to get their 
cars. Burke allegedly pocketed the cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke pleaded guilty to official misconduct in May under a plea  
agreement that forced him to give up his job and pension and agree 
to never hold another public service job in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the judge Wednesday that he had no explanation for his  
conduct and was sorry. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was fined $1,000 and ordered to perform 1,000 hours of  
community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke was named State Trooper of the Year in 1997 for issuing  
more than 1,000 tickets and making 128 arrests, more than any other 
trooper.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Courts Organized Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATERLOO, Iowa (AP) -- Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley,  
opening a two-day courtship of organized labor, said Wednesday that 
working families are missing the ``prosperity train.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting with union leaders, Bradley sounded solidly pro-union  
themes, with the glaring exception of trade, as he sought inroads 
to an important Democratic constituency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the only candidate for president of the United States  
with a union pension,'' Bradley said. ``I grew up early with an 
understanding of the importance of labor unions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spoke Wednesday at the annual convention of the Iowa  
Federation of Labor. He was being followed on Thursday by Vice 
President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Most early polling shows Gore with a lead in the race for the  
Democratic presidential nomination, with much of the party's 
establishment quietly in his corner. He also has the overt support 
of the White House political network. 
</P>
<P>
	That's left Bradley casting about for constituencies where he  
can begin to make inroads, and labor is an obvious place to start. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO has not issued a formal endorsement, though a couple  
of Iowa affiliates have done so. The Iowa chapter of the United 
Auto Workers union and the largest union representing state workers 
have endorsed Gore. But the lack of a national stamp of approval 
has left the door open, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the national level, no endorsement has been made and that  
has given me a chance and is giving me a chance to make my case,'' 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley used his appearance to sound pro-union themes ranging  
from banning companies from replacing striking workers to making it 
easier for unions to win representation election. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my absolute key objectives is to make sure that more  
Americans, working families in America, get on this prosperity 
train,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to his days as a professional basketball player,  
saying he spent nine years as a shop steward for the players' 
union. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was at a time when you had to go out and fight for  
things,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The unions have had occasionally rocky relations with Gore and  
President Clinton. Gore has faced tough questions from labor 
leaders unhappy with trade policies they say allow American jobs to 
be shipped overseas. Clinton and Gore argue that boosting foreign 
trade bolsters the economy and creates jobs in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is not well positioned to take advantage of that rift,  
however, because his trade policies are not much different from 
Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be careful in international trade negotiations to  
take full consideration of the impact on working people in this 
country,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most often attacked by labor leaders are the North American Free  
Trade Agreement, and the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, 
and Bradley said there's no realistic chance of either being 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Gore and Bradley also face another balancing act on trade.  
While unions, a key Democratic constituency, dislike those trade 
deals, they are very popular in farm circles because they make it 
easier to sell commodities abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually every Iowa politician in both parties back the  
agreements, though some call for additional talks to bolster worker 
rights and environmental standards in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Smith, president of the labor federation, said Gore  
probably enjoys the same lead among union members as he does among 
Democrats generally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they are any different from everyone else,''  
Smith said. ``It's Gore's to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are also conflicting pressures on union leaders. Some  
pragmatists argue that it makes sense to align early with Gore and 
make quick work of the nomination fight, conserving resources for 
the fall campaign against Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Others argue that it's important for labor leaders to make clear  
their displeasure with the administration to keep leverage.

<HEADLINE> Fed Seeks Electronic Disclosures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve is proposing allowing  
banks and other financial institutions to electronically disclose 
required information to consumers, with their consent. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank announced the proposal Wednesday. It is seeking  
public comment through Oct. 29 on the plan, which would allow 
banks, thrifts and credit unions to electronically deliver 
disclosures required by federal law regarding equal credit 
opportunity, electronic fund transfers, truth in lending and other 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosures could be sent to consumers' e-mail addresses or  
posted on a financial institution's Web site. In the latter case, 
the institution would have to send a notice alerting consumers that 
the information had been posted. 
</P>
<P>
	Before obtaining customers' consent for electronic disclosure,  
financial institutions would have to provide information about 
online disclosures and how consumers can receive and retain them. 
</P>
<P>
	Exceptions would be information that is generally available to  
the public, such as fee schedules for bank accounts, which could be 
provided electronically without customers' consent.

	Mom Acquitted of Shooting Daughter  
</P>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A jury today acquitted an elderly woman of  
attempting to kill her daughter, who was left paralyzed and went to 
court for permission to remove herself from life support. Jurors 
deliberated for seven hours before acquitting 68-year-old Shirley 
Egan of attempted murder. Police said Ms. Egan opened fire after 
hearing her daughter, Georgette Smith, and her daughter's 
boyfriend, Larry Videlock, talking about putting her in a nursing 
home. Videlock was not hit. Ms. Smith, 42, was left barely able to 
speak and incapable of swallowing or controlling her bladder. In 
May, she won the right to be taken off life support.

	Turkey Quake Toll Near 3,900  
</P>
<P>
	IZMIT, Turkey (AP) -- Ink-black smoke from a blazing oil refinery  
soared into the sky today, the result of a devastating earthquake 
that has claimed nearly 3,900 lives, left wide sections of western 
Turkey in ruins and threatens to derail its already-struggling 
economy. The inferno at the Tupras refinery was the latest disaster 
linked to the 7.4-magnitude earthquake that struck the highly 
populated region before dawn Tuesday. So far, 3,839 people have 
died and nearly 18,500 were injured, according to a special Turkish 
crisis unit. But many people -- perhaps more than 10,000 -- were 
still missing, officials estimated. 

</P>

	Calif. Is More Prepared for Quake  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Far fewer people would die if an earthquake  
like the one that struck Turkey were to rock urban Southern 
California or the San Francisco Bay area, experts said today. 
Advanced construction techniques and strict building codes should 
prevent a disaster like the one visited on Turkey, according to 
experts. California's modern earthquake safety law was enacted 
following the 1933 Long Beach quake that killed 120 people. It has 
been updated with subsequent quakes.

	Talks on Palestinian Prisoners End

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Talks on freeing jailed Palestinians collapsed  
today, setting back efforts to revive a U.S.-brokered peace accord. 
The talks ended when Israel refused to discuss any changes in its 
criteria for freeing the captives. Negotiators on both sides said 
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak -- like his hard-line predecessor 
Benjamin Netanyahu -- refused to include Palestinians who had been 
involved in violent attacks on Israelis in the prisoner release 
mandated in the U.S.-brokered Wye River accords. Netanyahu froze 
the accords last year with this refusal.

was driven from power, as sympathizers have sent her many pairs. 
``I seem to get more and more shoes, and I'm afraid that I will 
have more shoes than before,'' she said, estimating the collection 
at 3,000 pairs or more. When the Marcoses fled the Philippines, she 
left 1,220 pairs of shoes behind. The shoe collection astounded the 
world and became a symbol of excessive living.

	Heart Plunger Said Better Than CPR  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A French study suggests that a gadget similar to  
a toilet plunger is better than CPR at saving heart attack victims. 
While some earlier studies have found that the Cardio-Pump can be a 
life-saver, others have declared it no better than standard 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. With CPR, a person's palms are 
pressed against the victim's chest to force blood through the body, 
while oxygen is blown into the lungs. The pump is a handheld 
suction device that is intended to apply more pressure to the 
chest. The pump is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration.

<HEADLINE> Alternative Care Used as Supplement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Americans who try alternative medicine  
generally use it to supplement -- not replace -- traditional care, 
researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The research from Yale University is the largest study ever on  
the use of unconventional remedies, using a population sample four 
times larger than any previous survey on the subject. The study 
looked at patient visits for such services as chiropractic care, 
herbal treatments, acupuncture and hypnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were published in today's edition of The Journal of  
the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``These results show that alternative or unconventional medicine  
isn't really an alternative at all,'' said the study's lead author, 
Dr. Benjamin Druss. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers considered the cases of just over 16,000 adults. The  
responses were drawn from a 1996 study called the Medical 
Expenditure Panel Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	During that year, an estimated 6.5 percent of the U.S.  
population sought both conventional and unconventional health care, 
the study found. A little less than 2 percent used only 
unconventional medicine, while close to 60 percent used only 
traditional medicine. About 32 percent reported using neither. 
</P>
<P>
	People who had used both types of health care had significantly  
more outpatient visits -- eight vs. five -- and used more 
preventative services. 
</P>
<P>
	But only 20 percent of patients who used both types of care told  
their primary care physicians about the alternative therapies, 
Druss said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our findings reinforce the need for physicians to ask their  
patients about unconventional medical care so that these treatments 
are not at odds with conventional treatments,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Stephen Barrett, a retired psychiatrist and consumer  
advocate, said he found the study noteworthy because it contradicts 
previous findings that alternative treatments are widely used. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's long been known that most people who use so-called  
alternatives are satisfied with their medical care and go into it 
as something extra,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Won't Answer Drug Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush says he hasn't used illegal  
drugs within the past seven years, while insisting that such 
personal issues have no place in the 2000 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	He snapped at reporters asking about possible illegal drug use  
Wednesday, saying he would ``refuse to play'' that game. But he 
answered a hypothetical question The Dallas Morning News put to him 
later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper questioned him about the requirement that federal  
employees answer questions about drug use to get high-level 
security clearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I understand it, the current form asks the question, 'Did  
somebody use drugs within the last seven years?' and I will be glad 
to answer that question, and the answer is 'No,''' the News, in a 
story for today's editions, quoted Bush as saying in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a departure from the response he gave during a news  
conference in which he said rumors about his personal life were 
``ridiculous and absurd,'' possibly planted by political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what happens? Somebody floats a rumor and that causes  
you to ask a question,'' Bush told reporters. ``And that's the game 
in American politics, and I refuse to play it. ... That is a game. 
And you just fell for the trap. And I refuse to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since his first campaign for Texas governor in 1994, Bush has  
declined to answer some questions about his past. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was young and irresponsible, I behaved young and  
irresponsibly,'' is his oft-repeated answer. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug question continued to dog him as he campaigned later  
Wednesday in Baton Rouge, La. ``I made some mistakes years ago,'' 
he said. ``But I learned from my mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he quit drinking alcohol 13 years ago, when he  
turned 40. And in the wake of the President Clinton-Monica Lewinsky 
scandal, Bush said he's been faithful to his wife of more than 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	But since launching his presidential bid, Bush has steered clear  
of the drug question, saying he believes voters are weary of what 
he called ``the politics of personal destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's campaign says Bush believes there is a line to be  
drawn between legitimate questions about his record and other 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Important facts that people deserve to know about are how he's  
fulfilled his duties as governor, father, husband and employer. 
Those are relevant questions,'' said Bush spokesman Scott 
McClellan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is going to take this on and say, `Enough is enough.' If  
that leads to mistaken assumptions about his past, that's fine with 
him. He's not going to itemize for the children of America and his 
daughters, who are watching, everything he did or did not do in the 
past,'' McClellan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Comedians have capitalized on Bush's refusal to answer the drug  
question. 
</P>
<P>
	An Aug. 11 monologue by Jay Leno on ``The Tonight Show'': ``Bush  
has come under fire lately for not answering questions about 
possible cocaine use. Well, today, he came out for mandatory drug 
testing. He says he is for it. In fact, he said, 'Look, whatever 
drugs you've got, bring them by. I will test them.''' 
</P>
<P>
	During Wednesday's exchange, Bush did not identify anyone he  
thought was planting rumors.

	``Do I think they're being planted? I know they're being  
planted. And they're ridiculous and they're absurd and the people 
of America are sick and tired of this kind of politics. And I'm not 
participating,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, while seeking the White House in 1992, also faced  
questions about drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in England I experimented with marijuana a time or  
two and didn't like it,'' Clinton said. ``I didn't inhale and I 
didn't try it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An opinion poll taken earlier this year indicated Americans are  
about evenly divided on the question of whether the public needs to 
know about a candidate's past drug use. Just over half said ``yes'' 
in the February CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll. 
</P>
<P>
	An AP survey of 11 presidential hopefuls on Wednesday found that  
both the Democrats -- Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill 
Bradley -- have acknowledged trying marijuana. Eight Republicans 
said they hadn't used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaigns offered differing opinions on whether the question  
should be asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said the question is appropriate. ``I  
think Governor Bush is making a big mistake in not settling that 
issue and getting it behind him. ... Why not just say you didn't, 
if you didn't? And if he did, say why -- and how he's overcome it,'' 
Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every candidate has a responsibility to decide what questions  
are appropriate and how they are going to respond,'' said Gore 
spokesman Roger Salazar. ``The vice president thinks that this 
election will be decided by the voters on issues that affect their 
everyday lives and that is what he is focusing on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, former Gov. Ann Richards, whom Bush ousted in 1994,  
faced drug use questions from a Democratic primary election rival 
when she first sought the party's nomination in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	A recovering alcoholic, Richards openly discussed her drinking  
and her recovery, but she refused to answer the drug question. She 
won the primary, and GOP candidate Clayton Williams didn't raise 
the drug issue. Neither did Bush four years later.

<HEADLINE> Raitt, Hornsby, Colvin, Browne Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Jackson Browne, Shawn Colvin, Bruce  
Hornsby and Bonnie Raitt, whose paths often have crossed on tours 
and in the studio while working on one another's albums, have 
packaged their mutual admiration for a 22-show tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are my favorite singers and songwriters in the world,''  
Raitt said in an interview with Browne, Colvin and Hornsby at NBC's 
``Tonight'' show studio before a recent performance. 
</P>
<P>
	While it's a dream date for singer-songwriter fans to see so  
much talent on stage for three hours, the foursome say it's their 
chance to hit the road with people and music they love and respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is like running away with the circus,'' Browne said.  
``We're leaving all the responsibilities and the hard-fought-for 
control that you have and giving it up to people that inspire you 
and challenge you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tour, which begins Aug. 26 in Mansfield, Mass., and finishes  
Sept. 25 in George, Wash., grew out of benefit shows Raitt, Browne 
and Hornsby did together for Hurricane Mitch victims in December. 
They enjoyed themselves so much they decided to turn it into a 
longer gig. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had such a great time,'' Hornsby said. ``Bonnie called me  
once a week for the whole month of January and said, `We have to do 
this. It's too much fun, too much of a kindred-spirit feeling. We 
have to do this for real.''' 
</P>
<P>
	They invited Colvin to join them, along with David Lindley, a  
longtime Browne collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
	They've put together a five-piece band to back them and plan to  
perform a combination of one another's music and some songs by 
other musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like a Vegas show. This is four people playing in a  
living room, basically, and inviting 15,000 people,'' Raitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll be trading vocals on one another's songs, offering new  
takes on familiar material. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're like super versions of these songs because of the  
concentrated vocal power,'' Browne said. ``Some of my songs are 
just better than they've ever been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The friendship and good humor they hope will characterize the  
tour showed through during the ``Tonight'' show rehearsal, when the 
four and their backing band broke into a playful, funked-up version 
of ``End of the Innocence'' -- a Hornsby-Don Henley composition -- 
and a semi-bluegrass take on ``Amazing Grace,'' complete with 
whoops and hollers. 
</P>
<P>
	All four said they were happy to back out of the leader's spot  
and blend into a band. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything's a relief if you do one thing long enough,'' Colvin  
said. ``If you play solo long enough then you get to play with a 
band, that's a relief. If you're with a band, then you get to play 
solo, that's a relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you do your own material constantly, then suddenly there's  
a world of other people's material that you admire and love open to 
you, what a relief. It's great for me to be a backup singer and a 
rhythm guitar player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They'll be recording the tour and have talked about putting out  
a live album or video afterward. And Colvin said they even talked 
about extending the quartet's travels to Europe, Africa and 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The group kicked around ideas for a band name in the vein of  
other super groups such as the Traveling Wilburys. In the end, they 
decided a name would have been too confining and would detract from 
``something as special as this,'' Colvin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they said, they've simply focused on the music and  
having fun with musicians they've long admired. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the practice singing along in the car with these people's  
songs is now paying off,'' Hornsby said.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Accuses U S West of Bad Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Complaints filed by AT&AMP;T against U S West Inc.  
amounts to a jab at its competitor as they jockey for the lead in 
the high-stakes market to provide Internet, cable TV and telephone 
service, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keeping the other guy off balance is the way the game is  
played today. So I'm not sure how much of this is diversionary 
rhetoric and how much is real. We'll just have to wait and see what 
happens,'' said Jeff Kagan, an Atlanta-based industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T filed complaints with regulators in five states Wednesday,  
alleging the Baby Bell is ignoring telephone customers to steal a 
bigger share of the burgeoning multimedia market. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is fire behind the smoke signals AT&AMP;T is sending it  
makes me wonder why they didn't get together with the other 
competitors and file a joint complaint like they've done in the 
past,'' Kagan said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has built a nationwide communications network by acquiring  
or partnering with four of the country's biggest cable TV 
companies, including the MediaOne Group Inc. Several consumer 
groups have urged federal regulators to require AT&AMP;T to open its 
cable lines to other companies to offer Internet and other services 
or reject the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West is merging with Denver neighbor Qwest Communications  
International Inc. The new company would be a major rival to AT&AMP;T 
in providing telephone, Internet and cable services. 
</P>
<P>
	Against this backdrop, AT&AMP;T and U S West spent Wednesday lobbing  
barbs at one another after AT&AMP;T filed complaints with regulators in 
Colorado, Arizona, Minnesota, New Mexico and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``U S West provides its customers with the poorest service in  
the country and it's rapidly getting worse,'' said Frank Ianna, 
AT&AMP;T's network services president. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T also accused U S West deliberately failing to adequately  
invest in its facilities; refusing to build needed facilities; and 
favoring itself and its affiliates when it does invest in the 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West ``has made it impossible for AT&AMP;T to provide timely,  
quality services to many customers ...,'' Ianna said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Smith, U S West vice president for Colorado, denied the  
charges. ``(AT&AMP;T) provides worse service to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said U S West completes requested work for AT&AMP;T on time 80 to  
94 percent of the time while its competitor meets deadlines only 28 
percent of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints were simply a case of AT&AMP;T simply running scared,  
he added. ``AT&AMP;T is well aware of the fact that Qwest's data and 
long distance network around the world is bigger than theirs and 
more modern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the main reason why these complaints were filed, agreed  
Rex G. Mitchell, an analyst with Bank America Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has very little to do with service levels in U S West  
territory and a whole lot to do with competition in the local 
market and the long distance market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said AT&AMP;T is hoping its complaints about U S West service  
will convince regulators to approve its merger with MediaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	``The complaint may have merit but their motivation'' is winning  
approval of MediaOne and blocking U S West-Qwest from becoming a 
competitor for long distance. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said regulators will understand what is going on ``but  
consumers may not. If AT&AMP;T can convince consumers, regulators will 
vote with consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U S West is the primary provider of local telephone service in a  
14-state area of the Midwest and West. It is required to provide 
timely access to its network for competitors who want to offer 
local service. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said it does nearly $1 billion business with U S West, and  
is the Baby Bell's largest access customer. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators in several states served by U S West have been  
critical of the company in recent years because of complaints about 
delays in filling new service and repair orders. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West officials have said they are working to improve  
service, but were hampered last year by a labor strike and weather 
problems in several states. They also say the big demand for second 
phone lines for faxes and Internet service could not have been 
predicted.

<HEADLINE> Perelman Divorce Case Drags On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The marriage lasted just 20 months, but the  
divorce case is nearing its third anniversary with no amicable end 
in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Perelman vs. Patricia Duff is an interminable fight  
freighted with so much excess that even other rich New Yorkers are 
appalled -- and entranced -- by its many vanities. 
</P>
<P>
	Duff, a major fund-raiser for the Democratic Party, so far has  
run through 20 lawyers and $3 million in fees. But when the target 
is worth $6 billion, why scrimp? 
</P>
<P>
	The case now focuses on custody of 4-year-old daughter Caleigh.  
Though both parents profess to want the best for their child, the 
trial judge has seen otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have two very rich, two very willful people locked in a  
dispute which I'm absolutely certain is causing severe damage to 
Caleigh,'' Judge Franklin Weissberg complained last week. ``The two 
have been too focused on attacking, torturing and slandering each 
other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such acrimony seemed impossible when the power couple first  
locked eyes at a Los Angeles charity ball in 1992. The attraction 
was instant. 
</P>
<P>
	They'd both been down this aisle before, with five failed  
marriages between them. Perelman left each union poorer -- $80 
million poorer after his second divorce -- while Duff invariably 
prospered. 
</P>
<P>
	Her net worth after divorce No. 3 was in the area of $30  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Descriptions of Duff, who raised money for President Clinton's  
campaign, inevitably focus on her looks, and are inevitably 
flattering: ``gorgeous, green-eyed'' ... ``man magnet'' ... 
``luminous, like Grace Kelly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Descriptions of Perelman inevitably focus on his money: He is  
the chairman and chief executive officer of McAndrews &AMP; Forbes 
Holdings Inc., through which he owns the Revlon cosmetics company. 
He travels by private plane, private helicopter, private yacht. 
He's dropped $1 million on legal bills fighting Duff. 
</P>
<P>
	Noted divorce attorney Raoul Felder, asked about the case,  
laughed mirthlessly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It goes on because they have the money to fuel it,'' Felder  
said. ``There's a different justice for people with a lot of 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the trial's more petty episodes, the Jewish Perelman  
accused his wife of sacrilege: letting their daughter join an 
Easter egg hunt during Passover. 
</P>
<P>
	Another time, testimony was interrupted by this objection:  
``Your honor, if Mr. Perelman can stop smirking and laughing, I 
would appreciate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snapped Perelman's attorney, ``My client is not smirking and  
laughing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Is too. Is not. Is too. Is not.  
</P>
<P>
	The divorce case, launched in September 1996, seemed simple.  
There was a prenuptial agreement; under it, Duff receives $125,000 
a month in alimony and $12,000 a month in child support. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Duff, 45, wants child support bumped to $100,000 a month,  
allowing Caleigh to live in the same ultra-glamorous style with her 
mother as she does with her father. 
</P>
<P>
	The hard feelings escalated when both sides decided they wanted  
full custody of Caleigh, who was born one month before her parents' 
January 1995 wedding. She was Duff's first child and Perelman's 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Duff, concerned that her husband could somehow buy victory in  
the case, moved last year to open the trial to the public. The 
public then learned probably too much about Duff, the 56-year-old 
Perelman and their parenting: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Duff portrayed her ex-husband as an absentee father who never  
spent more than five minutes alone with his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A court psychiatrist testified that Duff was ``paranoid ...  
narcissistic ... histrionic.'' The psychiatrist added that Perelman 
needs long-term therapy to control his volcanic temper. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Perelman testified that when Caleigh is with him, she eats  
about ``$3 a day'' in food -- less than half the price of a 
Manhattan restaurant appetizer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The couple has squabbled over whether their daughter can  
receive riding lessons; where she should attend summer camp; and 
whether her afternoon nap should be cut short for private 
schooling. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither combatant has given up on love. Duff was recently linked  
with Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., while gossip columnists have 
spotted Perelman canoodling with actress Ellen Barkin. 
</P>
<P>
	Lost in the muddle is Caleigh, now a child of both privilege and  
pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``In one way she is very blessed to have wealthy parents,''  
Weissberg said. ``But in another way she is unlucky, because no 
child should have to go through this.''

<HEADLINE> Stephanopoulos Tries Out As Reporter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- So this is the life of a big-time network  
newsman. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa in August. Reading from a TelePrompTer at 3 a.m. Trying to  
persuade Dan Quayle to let you shadow him for a day. 
</P>
<P>
	George Stephanopoulos is experiencing all of this, completely by  
choice. After three years as an analyst at ABC News, he's trying to 
become a journalist, and this summer has been his screen test. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's former spinmeister wants to walk through the  
revolving door between politics and journalism, following the lead 
of onetime Nixon speechwriter Diane Sawyer, ex-Pentagon spokesman 
Pete Williams and former Democratic aide Tim Russert. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to try everything at this point,'' Stephanopoulos said  
before leaving to cover last weekend's Iowa presidential straw 
poll. ``I like reporting. I really enjoy it, although I'm very new 
at it and I still have a lot to learn. But I don't have a definite 
job in mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither does his boss, ABC News President David Westin, at least  
publicly. But summer is the time to try something new, and Westin's 
on the lookout for fresh, recognizable talent. Stephanopoulos is 
nearing the end of his first ABC contract as a pundit, and it's the 
right moment to see if he can do more. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very talented, bright, charismatic man, and there's a  
lot of things he can do,'' Westin said. ``At the same time, we're 
very aware that the transition from what he's done and what he 
could do is a delicate one and it's important to handle it just 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's no lower profile anchoring job at ABC than the overnight  
news, which Stephanopoulos tried for about a week. He also filled 
in for Charles Gibson one day in June as co-host of ``Good Morning 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He quickly learned the perils of the TelePrompTer, tripping over  
some words. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately he's tried reporting, handling peripheral political  
stories where his past life is unlikely to come into play. He 
interviewed Henry Kissinger about Nixon's final days in office and 
contributed a feature on political humor. 
</P>
<P>
	For some, time will have to pass before they can see the Clinton  
campaign strategist and White House adviser outside a political 
context. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think conservatives look at this administration like the  
Nixon administration,'' Tim Graham of the Media Research Center, a 
conservative watchdog group, said. ``I don't think the liberals 
would have abided by the idea of an ABC News correspondent being 
(Nixon aide) Ron Zeigler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanopoulos has taken shots from the other side, too. His  
expressions of disappointment in Clinton's behavior with Monica 
Lewinsky strained friendships. Some Democrats said he was disloyal 
and saw his criticisms as coldly calculated to advance his new 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanopoulos said that his remark when the Lewinsky charges  
first surfaced -- that, if true, they were serious enough to lead to 
impeachment proceedings -- were proven right. 
</P>
<P>
	``People got angry,'' he said, ``but what was the alternative?  
To say it was OK? I wouldn't be doing my job, and it's not what I 
believe. It wasn't fun all the time, but I just tried to do a fair 
and accurate job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those first days of the scandal were ``awkward, at times  
painful,'' because it was hard for Stephanopoulos not to think 
about how he would feel if he were still in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``But,'' he said, ``I thought the only way I could get through  
it personally and professionally was to be as straight as I could 
in the analysis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Steele, an expert on ethics for the Poynter Institute, said  
as Stephanopoulos steps into a news role, ABC must be careful to 
protect its credibility, making sure he isn't put in situations 
where people will be reminded of his old job. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalism purists, and people who watch the news, are by now  
familiar with reporters who have been through the revolving door, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He comes across as bright and thoughtful and there are times  
he has been quite critical, as he was in his book, of Clinton and 
the Clinton administration,'' Steele said. ``As consumers of news, 
we must all take everything we see with a certain grain of salt. 
There is no perfect journalism out there. It is all presented 
through lenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he won't do day-to-day coverage of the 2000  
presidential campaign, Stephanopoulos is freeing up time to follow 
it for ABC. It's a chance to experience politics from a different 
angle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved what I did at the White House. It was an amazing  
experience, but I was pretty burned out when I left,'' he said. 
``I'm still interested in politics and public service, but for now 
this is a deal that's interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>

	THE FULL NELSON: A political talk show with a studio audience?  
That's what Fox News Channel is trying, starting this Saturday at

group took the side of young people during the debate about Social

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Noel Has Bad Disc Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- Denver Broncos free safety Tori Noel was  
diagnosed Wednesday with a herniated disc, an injury that might be 
career threatening, 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time the second-year player has had such an  
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos said surgery would mean Noel would be lost for the  
year if not longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tori has a herniated disc between the fifth and sixth  
vertebrae before,'' Denver coach Mike Shanahan said. ``Now he has 
the same thing between the sixth and seventh vertebrae.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noel collided with running back Olandis Gary on Wednesday at an  
early morning practice.

	Gary jumped up immediately and returned to the huddle but Noel  
did not. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old lay motionless on his back and remained that way  
as team trainer Steve Antonopulos and his staff attended to him. He 
was later taken away by ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tori got a shot right in the back of his neck,'' Shanahan  
said. ``He went down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Gary, the injury came at the end of a routine goal  
line running play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was making a second effort just to get into the end zone,''  
Gary said. ``He pulled up on the play thinking the play was over 
and left himself defenseless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The good news was that no paralysis is involved. However,  
Shanahan said doctors feel they must fix the herniated disc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chances are he is going to need an operation,'' Shanahan said.  
``Dr. Richard Hawkins will give us an update if he is going to need 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had three or four come back after a herniated disc and  
played again,'' Shanahan said. ``I can't say I know anybody that 
has come back after two.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Audi of America Inc. said Wednesday  
it is recalling 46 2000-model TT sports cars because of a fuel line 
problem that could cause gasoline to leak. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker said that in some of the TTs, a small section of  
the fuel line assembly -- attached to the vehicle's underside -- 
could have been damaged during production. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, which could lead to gasoline leaking, has not  
produced any reports of fires, accidents or injuries, Audi said. 
One company-owned car did leak fuel, Audi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners are being contacted by mail and asked to bring the cars  
to an Audi dealership for a free fuel line replacement.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A fledgling Nashville, Ky.-based hospital  
company, working with a New York investment firm, is buying 15 
hospitals in four states for $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The unnamed company, formed by investment firm Joseph Littlejohn  
&AMP; Levy and Iasis Healthcare of Nashville, is buying 10 hospitals in 
Arizona, Florida and Texas from Tenet Healthcare for about $520 
million and five Utah hospitals from Paracelsus Healthcare Corp. 
for $280 million. The deals were announced Monday.

	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- An Iraqi opposition group said today that  
its military wing has shot and wounded an Iraqi deputy prime

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Energy Futures Prices Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Energy futures prices, reacting to bearish oil and gasoline  
inventory data, were mostly lower in trading Wednesday on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, cocoa futures declined, copper futures prices  
lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
	American Petroleum Institute figures released after the close of  
trading Tuesday reported U.S. crude oil stocks fell 3.245 million 
barrels in the week ended Aug. 13 to 319.828 million barrels, while 
gasoline stores rose 337,000 barrels to 207.013 million barrels, 
from an upwardly revised 206.676 million barrels the previous week. 
Refineries operated at 95.7 percent capacity, up slightly from 95 
percent a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures released Wednesday by the U.S. Energy Department also  
showed an increase in gasoline stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest surprise was the increase in gasoline stocks,''  
said analyst Tim Evans of Pegasus Econometric Group, noting it was 
first increase in nine weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks to higher domestic production and slightly higher level  
of imports, we have an uptick in inventories,'' he said. ``Combined 
with the page on the calendar, this is an indication that the peak 
concern over driving season supplies is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	API figures also showed an increase in heating oil stocks, which  
is expected at this time of year and had little influence on the 
market, according to Evans. 
</P>
<P>
	Technical factors also influenced the market's move lower, with  
the feeling being that Tuesday's price rise was overdone, according 
to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Light sweet crude for September delivery was 22 cents lower at  
$21.52 a barrel; September heating oil was .36 cent lower at 56.45 
cents a gallon; September unleaded gasoline was .44 cent lower at 
65 cents a gallon; September natural gas was .084 cent higher at 
$2.792 per 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures prices settled lower in modest trading on the  
Board of Trade of the City of New York as the triggering of 
automatic sell-stops accelerated the selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop was a continuation of a downward drift in prices that  
goes back to late July. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was pressured by reports of scattered rains in  
west-central Africa on Tuesday and Wednesday and forecasts of 
additional rain this week, which is expected to boost next-crop 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	Deliveries to Ivory Coast ports in the October 1998-September  
1999 production season totals 1.12 million metric tons as of 
Sunday, compared to 1.1 million metric tons in the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
	There continues to be concern in the market over the  
privatization of the cocoa industry in the Ivory Coast, done at the 
behest of international creditors, according to analyst Arthur 
Stevenson of Prudential Securities Inc. However, those concerns 
have already been factored into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	September cocoa settled $14 lower at $917 a metric ton.  
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures settled lower in trading on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The selling was triggered by news the Chilean government is  
making stronger efforts to end the port strikes that have blocked 
most copper shipments since Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also was pressured by reports that a labor dispute at  
the closed Highland Valley mine in British Columbia, Canada may be 
close to being resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the selling pressure were technical factors, including  
the triggering of automatic sell stop orders. 
</P>
<P>
	September copper was 2.50 cents lower at 74.55 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Major Turkish Quake Was Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	U.S. and Turkish scientists predicted two years ago that within  
the following three decades, a major earthquake was likely to 
strike Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	When the North Anatolian fault Tuesday unleashed a quake so  
strong it killed more than 2,000 people and injured thousands more, 
the epicenter was in the area of the port city of Izmit. The team 
of scientists had estimated a 12 percent probability of a ``large 
event'' near that city. 
</P>
<P>
	Earthquake researchers say the 30-year timeframe of the study,  
published in 1997 in the England-based Geophysical Journal 
International, is too broad to claim a bull's eye prediction, or to 
have prevented the death and destruction associated with Tuesday's 
7.8-magnitude quake. 
</P>
<P>
	But the authors of the study said the similarities between the  
prediction and Tuesday's quake demonstrated that the inexact 
science of earthquake prediction is improving. 
</P>
<P>
	``This method can tell us something useful about how earthquakes  
occur,'' said James Dieterich of the U.S. Geological Survey in 
Menlo Park, Calif. ``But I would not claim it's far enough along to 
base public policy on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another earthquake expert, Lucy Jones, said the prediction was  
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``They predicted that two sections of the fault would have  
stresses, and one of those sections had the earthquake today,'' 
said Jones, scientist-in-charge of the U.S. Geological Survey 
office in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The study predicting movements along the North Anatolian fault  
was conducted by Dieterich and Ross Stein of the geological survey, 
as well as Aykut Barka of Istanbul Technical University. 
</P>
<P>
	Searching seismic records, the scientists determined that the  
500-mile long fault, which runs east-west across Turkey, unleashed 
10 earthquakes of magnitude 6.7 or greater between 1939 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, they reported, the stress released by each tremor  
only served to transfer more stress and pressure to other weak 
locations along the fault. The process has helped to trigger the 
next quake, the scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stress is calculated to be high today at several isolated  
sites along the fault,'' Dieterich said. ``Increased stress means 
there is an increased probability that another earthquake will 
occur. Our calculations narrow it down as to where it might 
occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's event was the deadliest recorded earthquake to hit  
western Turkey. The subsequent shaking destroyed buildings, 
collapsed highways and cut off power and water to millions living 
along the heavily populated Bosporus Strait. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists were analyzing information from a worldwide network  
of seismic monitoring stations Tuesday. Teams of investigators from 
U.S. agencies and universities were preparing to fly to Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Geophysicists at the National Earthquake Information Center in  
Golden, Colo., described the quake as one of the most powerful 
recorded in the 20th century, rivaling the 7.9-magnitude tremor 
than devastated San Francisco in 1906. 
</P>
<P>
	The earthquake in Turkey was initially reported as a magnitude  
7.8 quake, but scientists said its intensity might be downgraded as 
low as 7.4 as additional measurements were taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't expect one of this magnitude very often,'' said Bill  
Smith, a geophysicist at the Golden center. ``It set off alarms at 
quite a few of our monitoring stations around the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a shallow tremor -- six miles deep along the North  
Anatolian fault. Much like the more famous San Andreas fault in 
California, the North Anatolian runs along the line where two 
plates in the Earth's crust grind against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneath Turkey, the Eurasian plate sits to the north and moves  
westward. The African plate is located to the south and moves 
eastward. 
</P>
<P>
	Seismic monitors recorded as many as 250 aftershocks in western  
Turkey in the hours after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest aftershock measured 5.3 in magnitude. It occurred 3  
hours and 15 minutes after the primary tremor, which struck at 3 
a.m. local time (8 p.m. EDT Monday), catching most people asleep. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, 485 people were killed by a 6.5 magnitude quake in  
Ercinzan, located on the eastern end of the North Anatolian fault. 
The U.S. Geological Survey study predicts a 15 percent probability 
for another major quake in that same area in the next 30 years.

<HEADLINE> SBC Plans E-Mail-Only Phone Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- SBC Communications, the telephone company for  
the Southwest and California, plans to sell an e-mail-only phone 
service for people who want to communicate online, but don't want 
to use a computer or surf the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The new eMessage service, expected to be announced on Thursday,  
uses a portable telephone attachment with a computer-like keyboard 
and screen. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC, based in San Antonio, hopes eMessage will appeal to those  
who find that e-mail has become an essential tool for business or 
personal dealings -- but also find computers and the Internet either 
intimidating, confusing, time-consuming or too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	eMessage would mark the first time a major phone company has  
offered service for an ``information appliance'' designed for those 
who want to use the Internet with the ease of turning on a 
television or making a call. 
</P>
<P>
	But an e-mail-only device might prove too limited compared with  
a new breed of Internet telephones that will enable people to 
engage in popular Web activities like shopping and chatting without 
having to boot up a computer or log on. 
</P>
<P>
	eMessage will be introduced in September at a cost of about $10  
a month, about the same as the typical monthly fee for limited Web 
access via computer, or half the fee for unlimited Web access. 
Likewise, the eMessage device will sell for about $180, half as 
much as the new Web-phones. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC will sell eMessage through its Pacific Bell unit in  
California and through its Southwestern Bell unit in Texas, 
Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Arkansas.

<HEADLINE> Mitch Richmond Stays With Wizards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The salary cap foiled Mitch Richmond's chances  
to go elsewhere, so he's staying with the Washington Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Wizards unable to work a sign-and-trade deal with  
Miami, Seattle, Golden State or Sacramento, Richmond agreed in 
principle this week on a contract with Washington that will make 
him the highest paid shooting guard in the NBA this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, first reported in The Washington Times, will pay  
Richmond $40 million over four years with most of the money 
guaranteed, according to a source close to the negotiations 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond is likely to receive $10 million in the first year of  
the contract, with annual raises of as much as 12.5 percent for the 
following three years. Richmond would have to meet certain 
performance incentives to receive all the money, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract puts Richmond ahead of Reggie Miller, Kobe Bryant,  
Latrell Sprewell and Ray Allen, four shooting guards who will make 
about $9 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
	A Wizards' source, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
the deal is likely to be signed next week after Richmond returns 
from a vacation in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really happy about getting this done and getting it behind  
me,'' Richmond told the Times. ``I think if you look at what the 
team has done, there is a big upside now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost some quality players, but we also gained some quality  
in the guys we picked up. I'm glad to be in a position where I'm 
with a team that I can finish my career with. Now the goal is to 
get into the playoffs and make some noise this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond, a free agent, averaged a team-high 19.7 points for the  
Wizards last season after coming from Sacramento in the trade that 
sent Chris Webber to the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	But that scoring average was also the lowest of the 33-year-old  
Richmond's career, and Wizards were 18-32 last season. With 
Washington selecting another shooting guard, Richard Hamilton, in 
the June draft, general manager Wes Unseld declined to offer 
Richmond the maximum $14 million per year for which he was eligible 
under the new collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	So Richmond's agent talked to several other teams. Golden State  
could only pay less than half of what Washington offered. Seattle 
could have paid more, but the Wizards turned down the Sonics' trade 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami was Richmond's preferred choice, even if it meant a  
substantial pay cut, but the complex salary cap rules meant a third 
team needed to be involved in a sign-and-trade deal. With the Heat 
unwilling to part with P.J. Brown, no deal could be worked out.

<HEADLINE> 3 Siblings Get U.S. Open Wild Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Former Wimbledon finalist MaliVai  
Washington and two of his siblings are among 16 players who 
received wild card entries into the 1999 U.S. Open on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	MaliVai Washington, 30, lost in the 1996 Wimbledon final to  
Richard Krajicek and also played in the 1996 Olympics. He has been 
sidelined with an injury most of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also given wild cards into the main draw were his brother,  
Mashiska, and sister, Mashona. 
</P>
<P>
	It is believed to be the first time three siblings have received  
wild cards into the main draw of America's premier tennis 
tournament. This year's tournament begins Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Mashiska and Mashona Washington received wild cards into the  
U.S. Open qualifying in 1994-97. 
</P>
<P>
	MaliVai Washington also played for the U.S. Davis Cup team in  
1993, 1996 and 1997 and was ranked as high as No. 11 in the world 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Other men receiving wild card entries were James Blake, Bob  
Bryan, Taylor Dent, Kevin Kim, Phillip King and Jeff Morrison. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dixie Union Wins at Del Mar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) -- Dixie Union remained undefeated Wednesday  
with a half-length victory over Exchange Rate in the $150,000 Best 
Pal Stakes at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Alex Solis, Dixie Union covered 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:16  
2-5 and paid $4.80, $2.80 and $2.40. Exchange Rate returned $3.80 
and $2.60, while Captain Steve, another 5 1/2 lengths back in third, 
paid $2.60 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Exchange Rate took the lead from the outside entering the  
stretch, but Dixie Union fought back to get in front. 
</P>

	Dixie Union, a 2-year-old Kentucky-bred, won the Hollywood

<HEADLINE> Upstart Union Defeats UFW in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- The head of the nation's largest  
strawberry grower says an upstart union has defeated the United 
Farm Workers in a final count of votes to determine which one will 
represent its pickers and packers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the UFW did not concede the election and said Tuesday  
that it plans to pursue objections filed with the state 
Agricultural Labor Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``This election cannot be certified and no party can claim  
victory until those objections are resolved,'' the group said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Relations Board officials did not return a call Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	In June, nearly 1,400 workers at Coastal Berry Co. voted for the  
UFW or the rival union, Coastal Berry of California Farm Worker 
Committee. No winner could be announced because enough ballots were 
contested to prevent either union from gaining the required 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a statement Tuesday from Coastal Berry Co.  
President Ernie Farley, the Labor Relations Board tallied 725 votes 
for the Farm Worker Committee and 616 for the UFW. There were 19 
unresolved ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy the election is over and we look forward to a long  
and prosperous relationship with a certified union representing our 
workforce,'' Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UFW has been trying to unionize Oxnard-based Coastal Berry  
for several years in hopes of building momentum for union contracts 
throughout the state's $600 million, 20,000-worker strawberry 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Representation was seen as key to the future of the UFW, whose  
membership has dwindled over the years.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Lineman To Be Cited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona Cardinals lineman Lester Holmes will be  
issued a traffic citation in connection with a rollover accident 
that severely injured a teammate, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Holmes is going to be cited for speed not reasonable and  
prudent,'' state Department of Public Safety officer Mark Hall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such tickets typically carry fines of $80 to $100, according to  
clerks at the Flagstaff Justice Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The DPS said Holmes was driving teammate Ernest Dye's luxury  
sports car when it veered off rainy Interstate 17 and rolled Monday 
morning about 25 miles south of Flagstaff, where the team has its 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The car was traveling about the posted 75 mph speed limit in a  
heavy rain at the time of the crash, according to DPS reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Carl Simpson and Dye, a tackle, were thrown from  
the car. Dye's right arm was crushed and nearly torn off. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes, the only player wearing a seat belt, suffered a severe  
cut on the forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	All three were taken to Flagstaff Medical Center. Simpson was  
checked for pain in his hip and released. Holmes spent one night at 
the hospital before being released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye remained at the hospital Wednesday in serious condition. He  
is still recovering from more than eight hours of surgery Monday 
night to reattach his arm and repair the bone, arteries and soft 
tissues. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Holmes has returned to Phoenix to recuperate, Hall said  
the ticket will be sent to the Flagstaff Justice Court by the end 
of the week and a summons will then be mailed to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals spokesman Paul Jensen said the team was aware of the  
pending citation and had informed Holmes, but had no comment on the 
situation.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Coax Fryar From Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FROSTBURG, Md. (AP) -- The Washington Redskins have agreed to  
terms with receiver Irving Fryar, luring the five-time Pro Bowl 
receiver out of retirement, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The signing's a foregone conclusion,'' a team source, speaking  
on the condition of anonymity, said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said Fryar could come as early as Thursday and that  
he could be in uniform for Friday's home exhibition game against 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Irving retired at the end of last season after a 15-year career  
with New England, Miami and Philadelphia. He has since been working 
as a football analyst at WPVI-TV in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to sign, definitely,'' WPVI sports director  
Gary Papa said. ``They've worked out some preliminary numbers. They 
told him they want to make him their third-down receiver. He likes 
it because it's close to his home, it's a grass field and he likes 
the offense. He feels like he can end his career on a better note 
than he did last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins have been courting Fryar for months, and  
negotiations intensified in recent weeks. Papa said Fryar finally 
agreed Tuesday to come back, left for Washington on Wednesday and 
had a physical and tryout scheduled at Redskin Park on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the agreement were not available. Neither Fryar nor his  
agent, Michael George, were available for comment. Redskins 
director of player personnel Vinny Cerrato would only say that the 
Redskins were in negotiations with Fryar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins have Michael Westbrook and Albert Connell as their  
starting receivers, but neither is a proven 16-game performer. 
However, Fryar will initially compete with James Thrash and Chris 
Thomas for the No. 3 spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryar, who will turn 37 next month, caught 46 passes for 556  
yards with the Eagles last season. He last made the Pro Bowl in 
1997, when he had 86 receptions for Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryar became a free agent at the end of last season because he  
did not meet performance incentives needed for a contract extension 
with the Eagles. He said didn't want to play anywhere else because 
it would mean moving his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't change my mind. I'm done. I am done,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fryar isn't the only retiree who could be suiting up for the  
Redskins soon. The source said negotiations continue with defensive 
end Chris Doleman, who quit at the end of last year despite a 
15-sack season with San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be a 1-2 punch,'' the source said.
