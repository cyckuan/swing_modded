<HEADLINE> Cypriot, Greek Leaders to Discuss Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot and Greek leaders
is to meet in Athens Friday to discuss the latest developments in
the Cyprus problem, including the missile issue, Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides made the remarks before his departure for Athens to
join President Glafcos Clerides, who arrived in Greece Wednesday
after a visit to London.
</P>
<P>
"This is a regular, routine meeting to exchange views and
assessments about all the parameters of the Cyprus problem,"
Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
He said his personal assessment is that one should not expect
to see "either black or white smoke" at the end of the meeting
about any of the aspects of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula, but the
Turkish Cypriots opted out of the peace negotiations last year to
protest against a decision of the European Union to begin
accession talks with Cyprus while scraping Turkey off its
immediate membership candidates list.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy
anti-aircraft S-300 missiles in a bid to boost its defense
capability.
</P>
<P>
The deal was criticized by the U.S. and other western
countries. Turkey, the Turkish Cypriots' ally, has threatened to
launch a pro-emptive military strike to prevent missiles from
being deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here suggested that the leaders of the two
countries are expected to discuss a number of solutions to the
missile issue to avoid the cirsis arising from the planned
deployment of Russian missiles.
</P>
<P>
The foreign and defense ministers of the two countries as well
as other officials dealing with the Cyprus problem are expected to
be present at the Athens meeting.

<HEADLINE> Official: Russia-Iran Nuclear Cooperation Conforms to NPT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia reiterated Thursday that
its cooperation with Iran in the nuclear industry fully conforms
to all international commitments of Moscow and Tehran, including
those on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iran's activity in the nuclear sphere is being controlled by
the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has not reported any
violations on the part of that country, Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Nuclear Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov has just
returned from a visit to Iran, which is a signatory to the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
During Adamov's visit to Tehran, the two countries signed an
agreement to accelerate the construction of a nuclear reactor in
Bushehr and contemplate possible cooperation in building more
nuclear power stations in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently
criticized the Russia-Iran agreement as a threat to the entire
region. He expressed hope that Russia will revise this initiative
because, he said, it contradicts attempts to achieve peace and
stability in the region, Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> Saddam's Deputy Makes Public Appearance After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Izzat Ibrahim, vice-chairman
of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), visited on Thursday
two religious holy shrines in Samarra Province, 120 kilometers
north of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
This is the first public appearance since Ibrahim, the deputy
to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, narrowly escaped an
assassination attempt on Sunday morning, the Iraq News Agency
(INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim was accompanied by Iraq's Command of Arab Baath
Socialist Party member Mohammed Younis al-Ahmed and Samarra
Province Governor Salah Eddin, INA said.
</P>
<P>
The assassination occurred in Karbala, a holy shrine of the
Shiite Muslim 50 kilometers south of Baghdad, where Ibrahim, a
Sunni himself, was to attend a religious ceremony on behalf of
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Two hand grenades were thrown towards Ibrahim when he was
getting out of his car to shake hands with people greeting him.
Ibrahim survived sound and safe, but his body guards and some
people nearby were injured.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's assassination attempt was the second against Iraqi
senior officials in recent years. Saddam's elder son Udai Saddam
was injured in the leg by assassins on December 12, 1996 when he
was driving alone in the center of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
RCC is Iraq's most powerful decision-making body, with
President Saddam Hussein being its chairman.

<P>
One car parked on central Syntagma square was set ablaze by a

<HEADLINE> Museveni Leaves for Summit in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni left for Paris Thursday morning at the invitation of
French President Jacques Chirac to attend a three-day summit over
the Congo (K) crisis.
</P>
<P>
Museveni was seen off at the Entebbe International Airport by
Vice-President Specioza Hazibwe and other senior officials, Radio
Uganda reported Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
This summit is expected to be attended by Congolese (K)
President Laurent Kabila and leaders from Zimbabwe, Chad, Namibia
and Angola.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's call came after the failure of several earlier
summits on Congo (k) crisis convened by leaders from southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The four-month-long crisis seems set to drag on with no signs
of foreign troops withdrawing out of the third largest African
country.
</P>
<P>
Now, troops from Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad are
fighting alongside with Kabila forces.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have been accused of fomenting and backing
the Tutsi rebels fighting to oust Kabila and they are demanded to
pull out of the mineral-rich country unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
They, however, said their military presence in Congo (K) is to
safeguard their border safety and advocate that all foreign
troops withdraw out of the country and that Kabila hold direct
talks with rebels.
</P>
<P>
With the widening of the conflict, all the countries involved
sent reinforcements there in order to control the outcome of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The allied forces recently downed a rebel plane, a signal
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe announced marks the beginning
their long-awaited offensive against the rebels.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A total of 5,396 Iraqi
children aged under five and 2,464 elderly people died in October
of curable disease for lack of medicine in sanction-wrecked Iraq,
statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
The statistics, released by the Health Ministry Thursday,
showed that 1,811 children died of diarrhea, 1,507 children of
pneumonia and respiratory infections and 2,051 children of
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 631 elderly people died of heart diseases and
hypertension, 349 of diabetes and 1,484 of malignant neoplasms.
</P>
<P>
These figures formed a sharp contrast to those in October 1989,
or 10 months before the sanctions, when 272 children and 394
elderly people died of various diseases.
</P>
<P>
A health ministry study showed that 57,421 children and 54,638
elderly people died in the first 10 months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990 will not be lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify
that Baghdad has cleared of all weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Al-Zawra weekly said Thursday
that cholera was spreading in northern Iraq's three Kurdish
autonomous regions. The epidemic so far has claimed some 240 lives.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities there have taken measures to prevent the

<HEADLINE> Visiting Chinese Military Leader Calls for New Concept of Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese military
leader Chi Haotian said that it is an imperative to cultivate a
new concept of security and seek a new way to safeguard peace in
the current circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Chi said he believes the correct way to safeguard security is to
enhance trust through dialogues, to seek security through
cooperation, to respect sovereignty mutually and solve disputes
peacefully so that common development could be pursued.
</P>
<P>
Chi made the point when he met with Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister Tony Tan here Thursday. Chi is Vice Chairman of China's
Central Military Commission, State Councilor and Minister of
National Defense, who is now in Singapore on a four-day goodwill
official visit from November 26 to 29 at the invitation of Tan.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Tan expressed Singapore's appreciation for
China's contribution to stabilize the regional economy.
</P>
<P>
Tan also told Chi that Singapore holds on to its "One China"
policy, saying Singapore's consistent and clear-cut stance over
the issue of Taiwan is that there is only one China and Taiwan is
part of China.
</P>
<P>
On relations between China and Singapore, the two leaders spoke
highly of rapid development in bilateral relations between the two
countries and their armies since the establishment of diplomatic
ties and they agreed to further strengthen friendly cooperation
between defense institutions and armed forces of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Chi arrived in Singapore in the morning on his last leg of a
five-nation tour which has brought him to South Africa, Botswana,
Namibia and Mozambique. He was greeted at the airport by Tan and
his wife as well as other Singapore high-ranking officers.
</P>
<P>
In his written speech on arrival at the airport, Chi said he is
paying the return visit to Tan's visit to China last year and his
trip is aimed at further developing friendly cooperation between
defense institutions and armed forces of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chi also said he believes that exchanges and cooperation
between defense institutions and armed forces of the two countries
will not only be helpful in deepening the mutual trust and
friendship of the two countries and their armies, but also be
conducive to peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Tan held a grand ceremony at the Ministry of Defense Thursday
morning to welcome Chi and his party before the two leaders began
their talks.
</P>
<P>
Chi will call on Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew Friday and deliver a lecture in the
Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies. He will also visit the
Singapore Military Institute and some military bases.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Raise Commercial Banks' Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Commercial banks in Uganda
will be required to raise their minimum operational capital from
one billion Shillings (one million U.S. Dollars) to two billion
Shillings (two million Dollars) by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by the Executive Director of Bank of Uganda
Katimbo Mugwanya at a one-day media workshop here Thursday, Radio
Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
Mugwanya said the current requirement for both the foreign and
local banks is inadequate and proposed that a credit rating
bureau be created to protect depositors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the central bank will give a chance to the
three closed banks to revive.
</P>
<P>
In September, the central bank discontinued the normal
operations of the International Credit Bank, Trust Bank and
Trans-Africa bank for failure to work for the interests of their
customers and to rescue the falling Shilling.
</P>
<P>
At present, the central bank is paying depositors of
International Credit Bank through the bank's credit insurance
scheme, he added.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Uganda follows Ministry of Finance guidelines in
inflation rates and growth rates parameter to determine the
desired liquidity in the economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The German federal deficit in 10
months this year ballooned to 82.1 billion marks (48.2 billion
U.S. dollars), the German Finance Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the increase had been planned and was under control,the
German Finance Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The deficit figure included short-term borrowing and if this
was ignored, the new debt would amount to only 44.7 billion marks
(26.3 billion dollars), officials said.
</P>
<P>
It said the budget allows a deficit for the full year of 56.4
billion marks (33.1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
To the end of October, federal spending amounted to 381.2
billion marks (223.8 billion dollars) while revenues were 299
billion marks (175.5 billion dollars) including 258.8 billion
marks (151.9 billion dollars) in taxation income. Projections in
recent weeks suggest the full-year tax take will be well above
budget.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry said the year-end deficit would also be
lower thanks to upcoming income from privatizations of state
assets.

<HEADLINE> Blair Urges Closer Ties Between UK, Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair Thursday called for better relations between Britain and the
Irish Republic after a peaceful settlement to the 30-year-long
Northern Ireland conflict.
</P>
<P>
In a historic address to a joint sitting of the Irish
parliament in Dublin, Blair said that after decades of division
caused by Northern Ireland, the province could now bring the two
countries closer together.
</P>
<P>
In the first speech to the Irish parliament by a British prime
minister since the Irish Republic declared independence in 1922,
Blair urged the Irish not to fear or hate unionists.
</P>
<P>
"They are good and decent people just like you," he said. "They
feel threatened -- threatened by terrorism and worried that the
Good Friday Agreement would force them into a united Ireland."
</P>
<P>
Blair stressed the links between Britain and Ireland, including
the impact of Irish immigration on his own constituency and the
whole of Britain's development.
</P>
<P>
Later, at a Dublin school, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
said his country too was working towards the same end.
</P>
<P>
He said the end of Ireland's constitutional claim to Northern
Ireland was a major step forward.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar, Laos Further Boost Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The official visit by Lao Prime
Minister Sisavath Keobounphan to Myanmar from Monday to Thursday
will further strengthen the bilateral ties between Myanmar and
Laos and bring their cooperation including that in trade and
economy to a new stage, Myanmar officials here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sisavath left for home Thursday afternoon after visiting Nyaung
Shwe, Shan state of the country. He earlier toured Yangon, capital
of Myanmar, Mandalay and Bagan.
</P>
<P>
Sisavath, invited by Senior-General Than Shwe, chairman of the
Myanmar State Peace and Development Council and prime minister,
came for the first time to Myanmar since he became prime minister
in February this year.
</P>
<P>
Sisavath was also the fifth leader of an ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) member country to visit Myanmar this year
after those of Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Sisavath was accompanied by his wife Khamla Keobounphan,
Vice-Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Somsawat Lengsavad,
Commerce and Tourism Minister Phoumi Thipphavone and two other
vice ministers.
</P>
<P>
During Sisavath's visit, an agreement on mutual visa exemption
for holders of diplomatic and official passports of the two
countries' citizens was signed. Another agreement on cooperation
between the state-run Myanmar News Agency and the Lao official
news agency Khaosan Pathet Lao was also signed.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations between Myanmar and Laos have developed
markedly in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
In June 1994 and May 1995, Than Shwe and then Lao president
Nouhak Phoumsavanh visited each other's country respectively.
</P>
<P>
During the latter's visit to Myanmar, three agreements on trade
and agricultural cooperation and the agreed minutes of the first
meeting of the Myanmar-Laos Joint Commission for Bilateral
Cooperation (JCBC) were signed.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also exchanged ratification instruments
regarding their agreement on the fixed international boundary in
the Mekong river.
</P>
<P>
In March 1997, then Lao Prime Minister Khamtay Siphandone (now
the president) visited Myanmar and two agreements on drug control
and border areas management and cooperation were signed.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on tourism cooperation was also endorsed in May
that year when Lao Deputy Minister of the Prime Minister's Office
Cheuang Somboumkhanh visited Yangon.
</P>
<P>
In August 1997, Lao Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavad met
then his Myanmar counterpart U Ohn Gyaw in Yangon and co-chaired
the third meeting of the two countries' JCBC, during which a wide
range of bilateral issues were discussed.
</P>
<P>
In September last year, Lao Vice Foreign Minister Phongsavath
Boupha visited Myanmar and had discussions with Myanmar officials
on the implementation of the two countries' agreement on border
areas management and cooperation. This month, the two sides held
the First Meeting of Border Authorities at the Central Level in
Yangon.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Laos, in an effort to facilitate the two countries'
transport and communications, established air links in December
1995, with the Lao Aviation Co. flying between Vientiane and
Yangon.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, which have a bilateral cooperation agreement
on drug control, are also among the six signatories to the 1993
New York Memorandum of Understanding on control of illicit
trafficking and abuse of narcotic drugs in the region.
</P>
<P>
In July 1997, Myanmar and Laos, together with Thailand, agreed
in Vientiane at the third ministerial conference of the three
nations on cooperation in eradicating opium poppy cultivation in
border areas and combating trafficking of chemicals and materials
for the production of narcotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
In that month, Myanmar and Laos were simultaneously admitted
into the ASEAN and since then the two countries have been
receiving technical assistance from the grouping for the
fulfillment of their obligations to the ASEAN Free Trade Area.

<HEADLINE> CBI Warns UK Recession Possible in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Pressure has mounted for
another cut in interest rates as the Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) revised down its forecast for growth in the economy
next year and warned that a recession looked increasingly likely.
</P>
<P>
The employers' organization also believes unemployment is set
to rise to more than 2 million again.
</P>
<P>
In its latest quarterly economic forecast, the CBI calls for
further cuts in interest rates after revising its growth
predictions downwards.
</P>
<P>
According to its predictions, Britain's gross domestic product
will grow by just 0.7 percent next year against an estimated 2.7
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The latest figure for 1999 is 0.5 percent less than the CBI
forecast in August and worse than Chancellor Gordon Brown's recent
predictions.
</P>
<P>
The CBI expects interest rates to fall to 5.5 percent by the
middle of next year and stay at that level through 2000.
Underlying inflation should be at or below the Government's 2.5
percent target.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of people out of work will grow from 1.74
million at the end of this year to 1.93 million at the end of next
year and 2.05 million within a further 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the survey pointed to another easing of interest
rates when the Monetary Policy Committee meets next on 8 December.
</P>
<P>
Kate Barker, the CBI's chief economic advisor, said CBI
forecasts assumed the European central bank would make a small cut
in interest rates in January next year.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been preferable to have seen the Bank make more
substantial interest rate cuts a couple of months earlier," she
added.

<HEADLINE> Warrant of Arrest Issued for Zimbabwe's Former </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's former
President Canaan Banana was found guilty in absentia Thursday on
all 11 counts of sodomy and indecent assault.
</P>
<P>
High Court Judge President Godfrey Chidyausiku issued a
warrant for his arrest with immediate effect, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Chidyausiku postponed sentence to enable Banana to be located
so that he could take part in the sentencing process.
</P>
<P>
Chidyausiku said in his judgment, "the accused has been found
guilty on all 11 counts."
</P>
<P>
In applying for a warrant of arrest, State Prosecutor
Augustine Chikumira said the state was aware that Banana had left
for Botswana around November 17 to seek for political assylum.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the publicity in the matter means he was aware of
judgment. His departure is illegal and the method of departure he
used was sinister," Chikumira said.
</P>
<P>
Banana was found guilty of sodomy at the president residence
where he sodomized his body-guard, Jefta Dube, during the period
between January 1984 to December 1986.
</P>
<P>
Banana was Zimbabwean president from April 1980 to December
1987.

<HEADLINE> Many People in Chechnya Face Another Harsh Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Life in the Chechen capital of
Grozny remains difficult for a great many inhabitants, especially
with winter setting in, said the International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"About 60,000 vulnerable people living in and around Grozny
depend on humanitarian aid for survival," the ICRC said. "Most of
them are elderly members of the Russian minority."
</P>
<P>
It is more than two and a half years since hostilities ended in
Chechnya of the Russian federation.
</P>
<P>
As part of the ICRC's winter assistance program, the local Red
Cross in Chechnya will receive this week food, blanket and candles
for distribution to about 1,100 people registered in its social
welfare and/or visiting nurses programs. School supplies will also
be provided for some 78,000 pupils.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC supports the efforts of local Red Cross branches to
assist particularly vulnerable people in seven republics of the
northern Caucasus and in the territories of Krasnodar and
Stavropol in the southern part of the Russian federation.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC said that security conditions still prevent the ICRC
from deploying expatriate staff in Chechnya, Daghestan and
Ingushetia. Assistance programs in these three republics are
therefore conducted from afar with the cooperation of local Red
Cross branches and local ICRC staff.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President, Japanese PM Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi held talks here
Thursday, exchanging views on a wide range of important matters in
bilateral relations and issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Both sides believed the talks were important and useful, and
would boost the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During the two-hour-long talks, Jiang elaborated China's stance
on the issues of history and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of history, Jiang said friendship and cooperation
constitute the mainstream of the Sino-Japanese relationship in its
more than 2000 years' history of development.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that Japanese militarists launched aggressive
wars against China several times in the contemporary history,
bringing severe sufferings to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking frankly, Jiang said that Japan topped the big powers
which invaded China in the late 19th and early 20th century for
the amount of sufferings it brought to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, Jiang said, China has always held that the
militarists should be accountable for the aggression, and
the Chinese people should harmoniously co-exist with the Japanese
people as they were also victims of the wars.
</P>
<P>
He added that there will be no change in China's basic policy
of developing lasting friendship with the Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president called on both sides to adopt a
forward-looking attitude on the issue of history, but the
precondition, he stressed, was to squarely face the
history and acknowledge it as it was.
</P>
<P>
The point, he explained, was also one of the political
foundations on which the 1972 Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and
the two countries' Treaty of Peace and Friendship were signed.
</P>
<P>
However, Jiang pointed out, it was regretful that the past 26
years since the normalization of Sino-Japanese bilateral ties
repeatedly witnessed such incidents as some Japanese created
disturbances over the issue of history. Some of them even denied
or distorted historic facts.
</P>
<P>
All these deeds have greatly hurt the feelings of the people in
the war-torn countries, including the Chinese people. They have
hampered the smooth development of Sino-Japanese ties, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China had to make necessary responses over these incidents in
order to safeguard the truth of history and political basis of the
Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that militarism was a common foe to both
the Chinese and Japanese people, and called on the two peoples
to fight against it.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has taken a definite stance on the
issue, Jiang pointed out, saying this will be conducive to Japan's
progress on the road of peace and development.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, Japan will gain understanding and trust from its
neighbors including China, Jiang said, adding that will also help
Japan play a more active role in international and regional
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Japan holds the key to settlement of the issue of
history, Jiang hoped that the Japanese government will draw
lessons in this regard, and contain forces in Japan that deny and
distort history.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said it is necessary to face up the history in order to
develop future-oriented bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Japan and China had an unfortunate history, Obuchi said. The
Japanese government had expressed deep remorse and apology for its
past colonial role and aggressive war in a speech delivered by
then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government hereby expresses remorse and apology
once again to China, Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
Japan, based on the sincere recognization of the past, has
walked along the road of peaceful development since the end of
World War II, Obuchi said, adding that Japan would not seek to
become a military power in the future. More

<HEADLINE> NASA's Ion Engine on Spacecraft Back in Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The ion engine aboard
NASA's Deep Space 1 probe was restarted Wednesday after ground
engineers sent commands to get it back in operation, The
Washington Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft was launched into space on October 24 from Cape
Canaveral by a small Delta rocket. The ion engine was powered on
November 10 but for only 4.5 minutes before shutting down.
Controllers tried to find out what caused the shutting down.
</P>
<P>
According to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the shutdown may
be caused by metallic grit or other contamination between two
high-voltage grids.
</P>
<P>
It is common for new ion engines to shut themselves off a few
times when they are first used, said Marc Rayman, chief mission
engineer at the JPL. The ion engine on Deep Space 1 may do so
again over its first few days or weeks in use.
</P>
<P>
The engine is necessary for the spacecraft to complete an
asteroid rendezvous planned during the mission.

...in the future.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Jiang said that maintaining a country's
reunification and territorial integrity is the sacred right for
every sovereign state. He added that it is a long-cherished wish
of the Chinese people to resolve the Taiwan issue and realize
China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
From a historic point of view, Japan owes to the Chinese
people, Jiang said, noting that Japan had annexed Taiwan by force
and enforced colonial rule in Taiwan for more than five decades.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government clearly acknowledged in the
Sino-Japanese joint statement that the People's Republic of China
is the sole legitimate government representing China, and
expressed full respect for and understanding of China's stance
that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added that the China-Japan Peace and Friendship Treaty
signed in 1978 had further confirmed the principles of the joint
statement.
</P>
<P>
This has not only settled the status of Taiwan politically and
legally, but also set a clear guiding principle in properly
dealing with Taiwan-related issues, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that it should be noted that there were some wrong
perceptions concerning the Taiwan issue in Japan. He hoped that
the Japanese government should respect the Chinese government's
stance on the Taiwan issue, stick to its commitment on the Taiwan
issue and handle the Taiwan issue properly.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said that Japan deeply understands the importance of the
Taiwan issue to China.
</P>
<P>
Japan has been adhering to the One-China principle, as set in
the Japan-China joint statement since the two countries normalized
diplomatic ties 26 years ago, Obuchi said. Japan is willing to
further expand bilateral relations on the basis of this stance, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Japan does not support Taiwan's independence and has no
ambition over Taiwan. This, Obuchi said, was made clear in the
past, and will not be changed in the future, Obuchi stressed.
</P>
<P>
Japan will stick to the principles set forth in the joint
statement and Japan-China Peace and Friendship Treaty while
dealing with the Taiwan issue, Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister also expressed the hope that
exchanges across the Taiwan Straits would be further boosted and
the Taiwan issue be eventually resolved by peaceful means.

...peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that since the normalization of the
Sino-Japanese ties, the mainstream and trend of the development of
the bilateral relationship are good. A comparatively solid
foundation has been laid for the bilateral ties through joint
efforts by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement and the peace and friendship treaty between
the two countries have laid an important political foundation for
the bilateral ties, said Jiang, who hopes to promote the ties to a
new phase through his visit.
</P>
<P>
The traditional friendship between the people of the two
countries has developed under the new historic conditions.
Exchanges and cooperation between the two countries have displayed
a good tendency to full development, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese and Japanese governments have attached great
importance to the bilateral ties, and have made clear that it is
one of each country's policies to develop a long-term neighborly
relationship of friendly cooperation, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Drastic changes have taken place in the international
situation presently. The trend of globalization has become clearer
day by day," Jiang said. "However, peace and development are still
the main task of modern times."
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese president, China is still the biggest
developing country in the world, and Japan is the only developed
country in Asia. The two countries have shouldered important
responsibilities for safeguarding peace and promoting development.
</P>
<P>
"It is importantant that China and Japan have accorded with the
evolving trend of the time and fixed a cross-century orientation
of the bilateral relationship," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President said that he is happy to see that through
consultations, both sides have reached agreement on building a
friendly and cooperative partnership devoted to peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
"I'm willing to make confirmation together with Prime Minister
Obuchi here about the agreement. And China is also willing to make
due efforts to achieve this goal together with Japan," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said that recalling the 26 years of history since Japan
and China normalized relations, the bilateral ties have scored big
improvements.
</P>
<P>
During the visit by President Jiang, the two countries have
proclaimed to establish the friendly and cooperative partnership
devoted to peace and development, which will set up a new
framework for the long-term and stable development of the
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
On strengthening the exchange between youngsters of the two
countries, the two sides have decided to sign the framework of a
cooperation plan on further increasing the exchange of young
people between China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the youth is the future of a nation and the
hope of the mankind. So it is very important to increase the
exchange between young people of the two countries and to further
promote mutual understanding and trust.
</P>
<P>
He hopes this plan will lead the exchange of young people in
the two countries in all sectors to a more active situation.
</P>
<P>
On China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), Jiang
said China's entry not only accords with the interests of China,
but also it is beneficial to the world trade system and all
trading partners.
</P>
<P>
Expressing appreciation for the positive attitude and the
efforts Japan has undertaken on China's entry into WTO, Jiang
hopes that Japan will adopt a more flexible and constructive
attitude, and complete bilateral negotiations with China as soon
as possible, to accelerate China's entry into WTO.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Greece Backs Italy to Extend Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis said here Thursday that his country supported Italy to
extend political asylum to Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) leader
Abdullah Ocalan, who is currently under arrest in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to foreign correspondents at a luncheon, Simitis
criticized Turkey for its reaction to the Italian government's
handling of the Ocalan issue, saying that European leaders had to
evaluate Turkey's reactions which he described as "intense,
exaggerated and almost violent."
</P>
<P>
Turkey was angry at a recent decision made by an Italian court,
which ruled that it could not recognize Turkey's arrest warrant
for Ocalan because the Italian constitution forbids extradition of
suspects to a country where they could face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Simitis stressed that Greece supported the recognition of the
rights and identity of the Kurds, as it did the application of all
international measures and agreements which related to minorities
and which would guarantee that the Kurdish minority would be able
to deal with issues related to their language and culture.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that Athens did not like to be involved in
the Ocalan issue because it would affect the improvement of
relations between Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The premier expressed the hope that the Kurdish problem could
be resolved through peaceful means.

<HEADLINE> WHO Focuses on Curbing AIDS Spread in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) regional office for Africa Thursday said in Harare it will
focus on reducing the spread of AIDS among young people on the
continent where three new infections occurred each minute among
the 10 to 20 years age-group.
</P>
<P>
In a message to mark the world AIDS Day which will fall on
December 1, WHO Regional Director for Africa Ebrahim Samba said
the severity of AIDS among the young was a cause for concern
because of their importance to the future of the continent.
</P>
<P>
He said AIDS was expected to reduce the average life
expectancy at birth in southern Africa from 55 to 42 by 2005.
</P>
<P>
" There are 1.7 million new HIV infections among the young
people of Africa out of the overall 2.6 million new infections
among all the young people of the world," Samba said.
</P>
<P>
He said the experimental nature of young people with sex and
drugs made them highly susceptible to HIV infection while adults
also preyed on them because of the belief that young people were
"safe" from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Part of the strategy, he said, is to talk to young people and
discuss how to reduce unfavorable societal factors that made them
vulnerable to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The WHO official said the AIDS pandemic had worst affected
Zimbabwe and Botswana which now recorded the highest rates
infection in the world with a maximum adult HIV prevalence rate
of 25.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Samba said, however, WHO operations were hindered this year by
armed conflicts occurring in 23 of the 46 African member states.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts have affected disease control operations, he
said. But he was still optimistic that diseases such as polio,
leprosy, guinea worm and river blindness would be eradicated by
the targeted date of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Britain Hopes Syrian, Lebanese Talks with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain said it hopes that
Syrian and Lebanese peace talks with Israel will be revived in
view of the recent progress on the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
The stance was indicated in a letter from British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook to his Lebanese counterpart Fares Boueiz
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After delivering the letter, British Ambassador to Lebanon
David Maclennan told reporters that the message tackled the
current situation in the Middle East, especially the Wye peace
accord between by the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Maclennan said his country sees the accord as a very positive
step in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed the
accord in Washington, under which Israel should withdraw its troops from
a further 13 percent of the West Bank in return for Palestinian
authority's tougher measures on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Maclennan said that Britain also wished to see similar progress
appear on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Israel is now in control of Syria's Golan Heights, that it
captured in the 1967 Middle East war, and a self-declared security
zone in south Lebanon since 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting
its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
But the peace negotiations between Israel and Syria, Lebanon
have been suspended since early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon have demanded the talks be resumed from
where they left off while the Netanyahu administration holds that
the talks should restart from the scratch.
</P>
<P>
Maclennan said that the European Union's Mideast envoy Miguel
Moratinos is continuing his contacts and consultations with
parties concerned in order to push the stalled peace process
forward.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Accuses EU of Interfering in Its Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Belarus Thursday accused the
European Union of interfering in its domestic affairs and trying
to impose its own vision of constitutional standards, public
institutions and democracy on the Belarussian people.
</P>
<P>
Belarussian Foreign Minister Ivan Antonovich told reporters in
Minsk that Belarus "is not to blame" for the difficulties in its
relations with the EU.
</P>
<P>
"European structures are trying to punish Belarussian
authorities for their decision to submit disputed internal issues
to a nationwide referendum in 1996 and for the opposition's
disapproval of them," Interfax quoted Antonovich as saying.
</P>
<P>
Antonovich said the EU "made a serious mistake when deciding to
support the defeated opposition." The opposition has talked
Western countries into imposing "some sanctions to punish"
Belarus, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Belarus has not shut itself off from the European community.
The country received a group of OSCE (Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe) observers in the spring," Antonovich
said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the OSCE, Belarus "is studying European experience,
bringing its legislation into line with European standards and
analyzing European expertise in democratic changes," he said.

CAIRO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The 22nd Cairo International
Film Festival, which lasts from November 25 to December 8,

delegations, a sign of improvement of their relations.
</P>
<P>
As a tradition, no Israeli films will be shown at the festival,
although Egypt has formal ties with Israel,
</P>
<P>
Israel has expressed regret that there is no cultural
cooperation with Egypt despite a peace treaty between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Two hundred films from forty-nine countries will be screened in
the film festival, including 80 from the the United States,
France, Italy and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries will be represented by 12 films at the festival,
one of the 10 most significant of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen films from 16 countries will compete for the
festival's highest award - the Golden Pyramid. The best Arab film
will obtain the Naguib Mahfouz Award, named after the 1988
Egyptian Nobel laureate for literature.

<P>
Special tributes will be paid to several filmmakers and actors,
including Japan's Akira Kurosawa who died earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Drug, Alcohol Abuse Becomes Social Problem in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Health Minister Nkandu
Luo said here Thursday that drug and alcohol abuse among the
Zambian youth has become a social problem.
</P>
<P>
When opening a three-day consultative seminar on management of
alcohol and drug abuse in the workplaces, Luo attributed the
abuse to personal, family and social negative factors.
</P>
<P>
Zambia News Agency ZANA quoted the minister as saying that in
the workplaces, various negative factors precipitated alcohol and
drug abuse and so far a total of 2,000 people in Zambia had been
registered as drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
After explaining the severe impact of alcohol and drug abuse,
Luo appealed to industries and all other sectors of the Zambian
society to join hands and eradicate substance dependence
behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
She noted the Zambian government would enhance and strengthen
health education programs on alcohol and drug abuse throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
Luo also warned that if alcohol and drugs were left to
penetrate workplaces, the socio-economic developmental fabric of
the country would be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
While speaking at the meeting, President of Program Against
Substance Abuse (PASA) Steve Kaliminwa regretted that many people
had lost their lives due to drunkenness and some others had also
lost jobs due to the same problem since working under the
influence of alcohol, drugs or any other substances of abuse
always resulted in accidents.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Russian company Gazprom
intends to build a new gas pipeline in Dobrogea of southern
Romania, Gazprom President Rem Viakirev told Romanian Prime
Minister Radu Vasile, whom he met Thursday in Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
The new pipeline will allow Gazprom to double its capacity of
transiting natural gases through Romania's territory to the Balkan
countries. Besides Romania that will be supplied 1 billion cubic
meters of gas annually, recipients will be Bulgaria, the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
For the accomplishment of this investment and the establishment of
the financial details that do not entail any effort from Romania, the
Russian party proposed the conclusion of an addendum to the
Romanian-Russian inter-government agreement of 1996 regarding the
Russian gas transit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The construction could start next spring, with local labor and
the participation of Romanian companies that were to manufacture
components, and end in 2000-2002.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian prime minister stressed at the meeting that
Romania was interested in relaunching the economic relations with
Russia. He said that the building of the pipe must not generate
exclusiveness for the Russian company, given that the European
energy market is a common market. The Russian party agreed to it.

<HEADLINE> WTO Starts Consultations Over Japanese Leather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization
(WTO) started consultations here Thursday on restrictive Japanese
trade practices in the leather sector at the request of the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The EU investigated access to the Japanese leather and raw hide
market for European exporters, according to a press release by the
EU mission in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The EU said that it concluded that complex tariff quota
management and subsidies to domestic producers discriminate
against European leather products and conflict with WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral contacts with the Japanese authorities failed to
improve market access and the EU issued a formal WTO complaint
last October.
</P>
<P>
The WTO consultations will investigate Japan's 45 percent duty
applied to the majority of leather imports. It will also review
the complex management system applied to the small quantity of
imports which are permitted at a lower duty rate, 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The EU claimed that the Japanese government also subsidize
domestic leather production and the EU believes several of these
subsidy schemes do not comply with WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
"If the WTO consultations fail to lead to an acceptable
solution, the EU may request a WTO panel as the next stage in the
WTO dispute settlement procedure," the EU warned.

LAGOS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian leader General
Abdulsalam Abubakar met with a visiting Chinese military
delegation Thursday in Abuja, which is led by Lieutenant-General
Liang Guanglie, Commander of the Shenyang Military Command Area
of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar expressed his welcome to the Chinese military
delegation and recalled his visit to China last July as Nigerian
Chief of Defense.
</P>
<P>
He thanked China for its precious help in the last few years
when Nigeria was at a difficult time.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar reaffirmed his government's willingness to further
improve bilateral relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-General Liang conveyed to General Abubakar Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's greetings and praised Nigeria's important
role in both international and regional affairs under the
leadership of Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The senior Chinese officer said China attaches great
importance to the Sino-Nigerian relations and expressed the hope
that his delegation's visit would further improve the existing
friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries as
well as the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the second leg of the delegation's three-nation
Africa tour. It had already visited Cote d'Ivoire and would

<HEADLINE> Starr's Office May Remain Open Two More Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's office may remain open at least two more years to handle
ongoing criminal cases and a final report, while a prosecution of
U.S. President Bill Clinton cannot be ruled out, Starr's spokesman
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Charles Bakaly said his estimate does not mean Starr would be
investigating the president for that entire period. There are two
criminal cases pending against presidential friend Webster Hubbell
-- one of which on appeal -- and a third against former Clinton
business partner Susan McDougal.
</P>
<P>
Starr also is still using a federal grand jury in Virginia to
investigate the activities of a land developer and Democratic
fund-raiser who had contacts with Kathleen Willey, an ex-White
House volunteer who alleged she was groped by the president near
the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
Starr's prosecutors are looking into whether the developer,
Nathan Landow, tried to influence or discourage Willey's testimony
against the president.
</P>
<P>
In his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee earlier
this month, Starr said the Constitution would allow him to
prosecute a president after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
"We have not ruled it out, but we don't talk about it," The
Associated Press quoted Bakaly as saying.

<HEADLINE> UK Has Less Than One Week to Decide Pinochet's Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) - The United Kingdom's House of
Commons on Thursday urged their Home Secretary, Interior Minister
Jack Straw, to make an early statement about the future of former
Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
After British House of Lords, the Highest Court in the country,
ruled out Wednesday that 83-year-old Pinochet should not enjoy
immunity from arrest, the Home Secretary was kept under pressure
in the Commons to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
British High Court ruled out early last week that the
government should decide before December 2 whether to proceed with
Spain's request to extradite Pinochet to face charges of torture,
genocide and murder during his 17-year rule.
</P>
<P>
Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said in a
statement on Wednesday that the "old, frail and sick" general
should be allowed to return to Chile "on compassionate grounds."
</P>
<P>
But some other Parliament Members said it would be a mistake if
Pinochet were released.
</P>
<P>
The Home Secretary's decision would lead to a full hearing in
the British court on the grounds for extradition.

<P>
PARIS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- President of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) and Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore
Friday rapped what he called "devastating cynicism of economic
crimes" against Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the opening ceremony of the 20th
African-French summit here, Compaore said the unequal distribution
of the wealth in the world has brought about more insecurity to
the poor countries in contrast with prosperity enjoyed by a
certain number of countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that while African countries are trying to implement
democracy, they are faced with "more and more numerous and
multiformed" crises, conflicts and trans-frontier crimes.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, the inter-state conflicts tend to criss-cross with
internal crises, and their killing consequences are not less heavy
with unbearable tragedies linked with displacement of populations,
famine and diseases," he said.

Forty-nine African states, including 33 heads of state, are

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov on Friday called for a "merciless fight" against
corruption and crime.
</P>
<P>
He told a cabinet meeting that Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin and Justice Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov would come up
with a package of draft laws to tackle the "acute issue" and
submit them to the State Duma, or lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
These measures "envision stricter laws for combating the
anti-public phenomena permeating our country," Interfax quoted him
as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the draft laws call for more transparency
as regards personal background of parliamentarians at various
levels, stronger measures against the illegal use of firearms,
murders and arms smuggling as well as stricter supervision of
private detectives and security agencies.
</P>
<P>
This would be "a first package of draft laws," he said. "This
is not our final appeal to the State Duma which will help us
combat crime," he said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov reiterated that an emergency situation is out of the
question. "This is normal work for the state," he said.
</P>
<P>
Political freedom does not conflict with a stronger state rule,
Primakov said. "Political freedom cannot be preserved if there is
no order, democratization is not anarchy."

LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- An English clockmaker's
journal, documenting his struggle for recognition as the solver of
one of the 18th century's greatest scientific puzzles, is to be
auctioned by Sotheby's in December.
</P>
<P>
The journal is expected to sell for 150,000 pounds (248,000
U.S. dollars) when auctioned in London on December 17.
</P>
<P>
John Harrison fought to persuade British government officials
that his revolutionary clock qualified for a 20,000 pound (33,120
dollar) reward promised to the first person to work out how to
calculate longitude at sea.
</P>
<P>
The journal, kept from 1761 to 1766, covers the construction of
Harrison's H4 timekeeper and the fight against prevailing
scientific opinion that mere mechanical inventions could not solve
the problems that had plagued lost sailors for centuries.
</P>
<P>
Scientists and sailors of the day believed that only more
accurate astronomical observation could provide the answer and
qualify for the reward offered in the 1714 Longitude Act.
</P>
<P>
Accurate readings of the time on board the ship and in another
place of known longitude enabled the user to calculate the ship's
position on the globe's north to south meridians.

<HEADLINE> Clan Fighting Continues in Central Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Reports from Middle Jubba
indicate that the fighting between the Moallimweyneh and Geladleh
clans in and around Sakow District, 400 Km south of Mogadishu,
has escalated in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
According to the field radio reports, the Thursday fighting
which had been one of the most serious at the outskirts of Sakow
District left at least 20 people dead while nearly 30 others
wounded during the clashes which no battle wagons were involved.
</P>
<P>
The armed clashes have reportedly spread towards the road
leading to Qansadhereh District of Bay Region, northeast of Sakow
Town, where both clansmen from the Rahanwein communities are
fighting for who could conquer more of the other's villages and
destroy their properties including the rain-fed farms of the
subsistence farmers.
</P>
<P>
According to radio reports from the area, about a hundred
heavily armed Hoallimweyneh fighters have made a new insurgence
against unexpected strongholds belonging to the Geladleh men,
killing about 17 men and wounding many more others two days ago.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen villages are reportedly deserted by their
inhabitants after the clashes have proven not pardoning neither
people nor wealth.
</P>
<P>
There was a large meeting in Mogadishu Thursday between the
elders from the two sides, in an attempt of containing the
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, the elders of Moallimweyneh and
Geladleh clans agreed upon the implementation of an immediate and
unconditional cease-fire, the opening of a dialog and the
dispatch of a joint committee to the region to start an immediate
mediation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the call for peace by the elders of the two
sides, there doesn't seem that the peace seeking efforts had
attracted the attention of the fighters in Sakow District where
the clashes still continue raging Friday.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China to Become China's Largest Granary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- China will invest an
estimated 10 billion yuan in upcoming seven year to turn its
northeast part into the country's largest granary and meat
processing base.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China, which embraces Heilongjiang, Jilin and
Liaoning provinces and four leagues in the eastern part of the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, covers an area of 1.24 million
sq. km. and has a combined population of 116 million people.
</P>
<P>
The region expects to raise its grain output from 81 billion kg
in 1996 to 99 billion kg by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic increase of 18 billion kg will help to meet half of
the increased demand resulting from a population increase of 90
million people during the period, according to Chen Yiyu,
vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks at a seminar on cross-century
agricultural development in Northeast China, which ended today in
Changchun, capital of Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
The region currently supplies the government with 35 billion
kg of commodity grain annually, with the grain output for areas
accounting for 14.9 percent of the national total. Jilin,
Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia lead other provinces and
autonomous regions in terms of per capita grain consumption.
</P>
<P>
The combined grain output for northeast China and the Plain of
the Yellow, Huai and Hai rivers, another leading grain producer,
averaged 67 billion kg during the 1984-96 period and accounted for
68 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China will be able to provide other Chinese provinces
with 45 billion kg of commodity grain annually by the year
2005. The volume will feed 112 million people, or a third of
China's urban population, according to Li Zhensheng, director of
the agricultural experts committee under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.

<P>
OTTAWA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Finance Minister Paul
Martin is expected to say "no" to two proposed bank mergers before
Christmas, the Canadian newspaper National Post said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision is likely to be announced in mid-December, when
Martin will have received a report from the federal Competition
Bureau on the likely implications of the mergers,
</P>
<P>
Four of Canada's major banks announced their merger plans last
spring. The Royal Bank proposed to merge with the Bank of
Montreal, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce with the
Toronto Dominion Bank.
</P>
<P>
The report from the federal Competition Bureau to Martin is set
to make it clear that the mergers of the four banks will
substantially lessen competition for bank services and run afoul
of federal competition law.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they would not be able to proceed without big
divestitures of bank branches and other business operations.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the report, Martin is expected to announce a
"no, but" decision to the four banks next month, which would kill
the proposed mergers in their current forms.
</P>
<P>
However, the door would be left open to the banks to resubmit
their proposals in modified form some time next year, the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> India Clears 253-member Team for Bangkok Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government
cleared a 253-member contingent, including 188 competitors, for
next month's Asian Games in Bangkok, Indian Olympic Association
(IOA) announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
IOA president Suresh Kalmadi told a press conference here that
the overall strength was expected to be around 320 with a Kabaddi
team being selected and men's volleyball and football "certain"
to go.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the final shape of the Indian squad for the
quadrennial mega event to be held from December 6 to 20, Kalmadi
said India would participate 22 of the total 36 medal disciplines
for which IOA had forwarded lists.
</P>
<P>
The list cleared today also consisted of 40 coaches, five
doctors and masseurs each and one physiotherapist.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of volleyball and men's football, Kalmadi said
technically clearance had not come from the government, but he
had discussed with the Sports Ministry and it was only a matter
of formality for the two teams to be cleared.
</P>
<P>
As for the Kabaddi team, he said that a list had been sent and
there won't be any trouble getting the government approval,
adding that he was confident for a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
The government had slashed the original IOA list by 12 but
added three more in yachting which reduces the final list only by
nine.
</P>
<P>
However, in keeping with its recent practice, all managers had
been cleared only at "no cost" base.
</P>
<P>
The IOA president said that IOA would discuss with volleyball
and football federations to sort out the issue of expenditure on
their respective team.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China to Become China's Largest Granary  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Experts attending the symposium shared the view that northeast
China has great potential to attain the objectives, and noted that
the region covers one of the world's three most fertile black soil
zones.
</P>
<P>
They also noted the fact that the per capita share of farmland
in northeast China is more than double the figure on the Plain of
the Yellow, Huai and Hai rivers, and this will enable the former
to provide more surplus grain to other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the region has 19 million hectares of low- to
medium-yielding land awaiting improvement. The grain output will
also increase by a wide margin once irrigation is introduced to 80
percent of the region's farmland.
</P>
<P>
The experts suggested introducing a series of measures costing
an estimated 10 billion yuan over the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
The academy pledged that 600 agronomists will be assigned to
offer guidance on the use of bio-technology, new types of
agricultural chemicals and efficient irrigation techniques.
</P>
<P>
Farmers on the Plain of the Songhua and Nenjiang rivers will be
taught comprehensive measures to improve fertility on 10 million
hectares of black soil in order to increase the per-hectare yield
of 750 kg. In addition, improvements to low land and wetland areas
on the Songliao Plain will raise the per hectare yield by 1,500 kg.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the measures will help increase the acreage
of northeast China's high yield fileds from the current 33 percent
to over 50 percent of the total cultivated land by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The region is also expected to become China's largest meat
processing base, with the annual output expected to rise to 10
million tons by the year 2005 from 6.55 million tons in 1996. In
addition, the region's meat and poultry egg output will account
for 16 percent of the then national total from the current 11
percent of the present national total.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Military Brass Discuss South Lebanon Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai met with senior military officers on Friday to
discuss the situation in south Lebanon following the killing of
two more Israeli soldiers there.
</P>
<P>
Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, among others,
participated in the meeting, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
The two soldiers were killed during the patrol in south Lebanon
Thursday night when two bombs exploded under their armored
vehicles, bringing the death toll of Israelis there to seven over
the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short his trip to Europe
and will be back home later Friday from London. He is expected to
convene his cabinet on Sunday to discuss the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition Labor Party leader Ehud Barak proposed on
Friday to set up a inter-party forum to work out a solution to the
crisis. He said the forum would include military officers and
representatives from across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres said that it is unlikely
that Netanyahu's right-wing government could achieve a settlement
with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that only a national unity government is capable of
making the decision, and it is a matter of urgency and should not
be delayed for two years until the next general elections.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared "security zone" in South Lebanon
in 1985 after two invasions, allegedly to protect northern Israel
from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah and other militant resistance groups have
been staging attacks against Israeli troops in order to dislodge
them. A total of 23 Israelis have been killed in south Lebanon
since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
In April, Israeli Cabinet approved the U.N. Security Council
Resolution 425, which calls for unconditional Israeli withdrawal
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But the Israelis insisted that they must first get security
guarantees from the Lebanese government before their troops pull
out.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Lebanese government rejected the Israeli
offer, insisting that Israel comply with the U.N. resolution
passed two decades ago and pull back unconditionally.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The State Natural Science Fund
Committee (SNSFC) recently granted research funds totaling 75
million yuan (about nine million U.S. dollars) to 150 young
Chinese scientists currently working both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 outstanding young Chinese scientists under the age of
45 were granted annual financial support of 600,000 yuan each,

<HEADLINE> Federations Agree on Anti-Doping Package but Three Object </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- All Olympic sports
federations, except those for soccer, tennis and cycling, agreed
on Friday in Lausanne to a package of anti-doping measures.
</P>
<P>
The sports federations endorsed a unified Olympic medical code
that calls for a minimum two-year suspension for athletes found
guilty of taking steroids and other serious performance-enhancing
drugs while a life ban will be slammed down for a second offense.
</P>
<P>
FIFA, the governing body of soccer, expressed their reserved
view about the two-year penalty on grounds that certain banned
drugs could not enhance the performance of soccer players.
</P>
<P>
But IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said he was confident
the three federations would sign up to the agreement before the
World Anti-doping Conference in Lausanne from February 2-4.
</P>
<P>
The package included a clause requiring all federations to
comply with the terms of the accord, or risk their spot in the
Olympic Games program.
</P>
<P>
The provision reads: "The sports included on the program of
the Olympic Games must be governed by international federations
which agree to comply" with the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Government to Bail out Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Canadian cabinet ministers have
agreed in principle to raise a disaster fund which could amount to
1.7-billion Canadian dollars (1.1 billion U.S. dollars) to help
beleaguered farmers.
</P>
<P>
They asked Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief to firm up
administrative details so they could formally approve the plan
soon.
</P>
<P>
Under Vanclief's plan, 400 million Canadian dollars (260
million U.S.dollars) will be provided to ease farmers' income
crisis this year, and 500 million Canadian dollars (325 million
U.S. dollars) next year, when the crisis is expected to be
worse.
</P>
<P>
About 400 million Canadian dollars (260 million U.S. dollars)
will be allocated annually in the third and fourth years.
</P>
<P>
While the aid program would be available to any farmer whose
income falls more than 70 percent from their average of previous
years, grain farmers on the Prairies and hog farmers across the
country have been hit especially hard by falling commodity prices
and would likely benefit the most.
</P>
<P>
According to figures from Statistics Canada, grain prices
have dropped 25 percent from a year ago, while hog prices have
seen a even sharper fall of more than 60 percent, mainly because
of the Asian financial crisis and a subsidy war between the United
States and the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Highly Positive Toward Development of Civil Aviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 27 (Xinhua) -- As road transport facility
is not available in all parts of the land-locked and mountainous
country, the Nepali government is very much positive toward the
development of civil aviation, the sole means of contact for all
the people.
</P>
<P>
Of the 75 districts in Nepal, 18-19 in remote and mountainous
areas do not have road access or any other modes of transport,
Nagendra Prasad Ghimire, director general of the Department of
Civil Aviation, told Xinhua Friday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"There you'll find air transport is not like rich men's domain,
but it's kind of poor men's hope," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's not necessarily they should be traveling by air, but to
transport goods, medical supplies and construction materials," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Besides, 88 percent of the tourists visiting Nepal travel by
air, so air transport is playing a very vital role in developing
tourism, a major foreign exchange earner for the Himalayan
kingdom, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the country now has 44 airfields and six more are
under construction with five in the remote and mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
A total of 120 heli-pads have been constructed, where big
helicopters like MI-17 can be used, so as to make air transport
service accessible in remote places, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen airlines are operating domestic flights with 66
aircraft of 15 types.
</P>
<P>
On the international front, Nepal has signed bilateral air
service agreements with 27 foreign countries and regions to make
up for the inadequate air seats of its own national flag carrier.
</P>
<P>
An average of 14 international flights are operating to and
from Kathmandu every week, the director general said.
</P>
<P>
He said that from 1975 to 1998, around one air disaster
occurred per year and it grew to 2.47 per year during the
1992-1998 period after the private sector was allowed to fly
domestically in 1992 with the number of aircraft increasing by
threefold.
</P>
<P>
He said that efforts are being made to upgrade the airports
with new safety facilities, including the adoption of
satellite-based communication, navigation, surveillance and air
traffic management (CNS/ATM) systems.
</P>
<P>
"The government has already laid emphasis upon having another
full-fledged international airport in Nepal," he said, adding that
the pre-feasibility study has been carried out.
</P>
<P>
The Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu is so far the
only one of its kind in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
On the challenges facing the civil aviation in Nepal, the
director general said that the country needs resources to cope
with the changing technologies because civil aviation is an
industry of hi-tech.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in civil aviation in Nepal is encouraged, he
added.

pager-sized Windows CE operating system.
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said Windows CE is a completely new system
which can be used for communications with remote computers and
data processors.
</P>
<P>
He noted that development of the system will lead to a new
revolution in operating systems.
</P>
<P>
"Computers are becoming smaller and smaller. We designed
Windows CE to consumers who want to use computer much the way they
use mobile phones," said Zhang Xianghui, director of the Microsoft
China Development Center.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the "C" represents Consumer, Compact,
Connectivity and Companion, with the "E" representing electronics.

Casio, Philips and Chinese groups Legend and Hisense to develop
hand-held computers using Windows CE operating systems.
</P>

KUNMING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Earthquake victims in
southwest China's Yunnan Province have benefited greatly from
the influx of funds and relief materials donated by people from
both at home and abroad, according to local civil affairs
workers.
</P>
<P>
Two quakes measuring 5.0 and 6.2 on the Richter Scale hit
Ninglang Yi Nationality Autonomous County on November 19, killing
three and injuring more than 1,500 others. The quakes and
subsequent tremors also damaged some 28,000 houses and created
direct economic losses of 475 million yuan.

truckloads of relief materials, mostly donations, had been
delivered to the quake-stricken area by Thursday.

<P>
The ground floor hallway in Xu's department was filled with
relief materials ranging from cotton coats and quilts to blankets
and tents, all of which were packed and ready for distribution.

KUWAIT CITY, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President
George Bush arrived in Jeddah, coastal city of Saudi Arabia, on
Friday for a visit to discuss with Saudi leaders regional and
world issues.
</P>
<P>
Bush is due to hold meetings with a number of Saudi officials

Kuwait and Saudi Arabia since he stepped down in 1992.
</P>

<P>
MOSCOW, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's state of health is "satisfactory" and his temperature is
normal, his spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The president's work has increased compared to Monday and
Tuesday," Dmitry Yakushkin said, citing as evidence that Yeltsin
has held several telephone conversations and worked on a number of
documents.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has to stay in bed "half of the time" in the Central
Clinical Hospital, Yakushkin said. "Sometimes he lies down, and
sometimes he moves around the ward or works at his desk."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Yeltsin's stay in hospital "will depend on
the progress of his treatment."
</P>
<P>
He said Yeltsin was more likely to suffer from colds than many
other people because "his workload is very heavy and his schedule
is packed."
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin noted that in 1996 Yeltsin "had several heart
attacks virtually without hospitalization and conducted a very
energetic election campaign."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's health has prompted calls for him to step down, but
Yakushkin told the Izvestia newspaper that the Presidential
Administration is certain that Yeltsin will remain physically fit
for performing his functions through 2000, when his term expires.

PARIS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan Friday urged African countries to choose peace,
democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Addressing 33 African heads of state and President Jacques
Chirac of France at the 20th Franco-African summit here, Annan
expressed deep concern over the war in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRCongo) and a number of other countries in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Conflicts are caused by human nations and they should be ended
by human nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan praised Nigeria for trying to end two decades of military
dictatorship and open up for democracy.
</P>
<P>
He said that his biggest concern over Africa is for the black
continent to build peace and stability, so that it can win
international investors and go ahead with its programs of economic
development.
</P>
<P>
While economic and social development are inevitable for
Africa, political stability is a precondition for all progress, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Africa is in an epoch of great mutation and crises at the same
time," he said, noting that "if African countries cannot achieve
political stability, they will never go out of the status of
under-development."
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed confidence in the future of the African
continent, which he said has a great potential of development with
its human and material resources.
</P>
<P>
When Annan was making the speech, President Laurent Kabila of
the DRCongo lowered his head and nodded from time to time.
</P>
<P>
The presence of both Kabila and President Yoweri Museveni of
Uganda at the summit has raised high hope that a diplomatic
maneuver could be launched for solving the crisis in the DRCongo.
</P>
<P>
President of the Organization of African Unity Blaise Compaore
said that he will meet with Kabila and Museveni to mediate a
political solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The DRCongo has accused Uganda and Rwanda of aggression.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Buy Local Grain for Angola's Food Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
has signed an agreement with farmers in central Angola's Bie
Province to buy the latters' maize for WFP's relief program for
the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Heanne Biosclair, official with the WFP office in Luanda,
said here Friday that buying grain from Bie and Huambo
Provinces, known as granaries in central Angola, is good in
that it could not only reduce the big cost of transporting food
from abroad, and also promote the development of agriculture of
the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Bioclair said that the practice, piloted in neighboring
Huila Province, where 700 tons of maize and wheat were purchased.
</P>
<P>
She said that WFP will do the same in other Angolan provinces
after an estimated 3,000 tons of grain is bought in the central
provinces in the 1998/99 season.
</P>
<P>
However, the food supply situation is still very serious in
the country, hit by long years of war, Bioclair said, adding
that the country is in need of 470,000 tons of food in the
1988/99 season, with 120,000 tons have to be imported for the
one million refugees.

<HEADLINE> Oral Cholera Vaccine Undergoes Human Trials in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A new and indigenous oral
cholera vaccine, ideal for tropical countries, has been developed
and is undergoing human trials in India, the Press Trust of India
(PTI) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine had worked well on animals and researchers were
testing its immunogeneticity and reactions on humans, the agency
quoted Director General of the Indian Council of Medical Research
N. K. Ganguly as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ganguly told the Center for Cellular And Molecular Biology in
Hyderaban, 1,500 kilometres south of here, that all oral vaccines
except that for polio made in the West had failed in India because
of the microflora lining the gut.
</P>
<P>
Even the anti-typhoid vaccine now marketed in India is a
failure, he said.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies had revealed that the "gut flora",
micro-organisms (mainly bacteria, present in the alimentary canal)
of India, was so complex and high that no oral vaccine can survive
in such a harsh environment, according to Ganguly.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the new anti-cholera vaccine uses a new
"envelope" and is not gobbled up by the microflora, which does not
allow the new organism to establish itself.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Receives Message from Gaddafi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
received a message Friday from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on
the upcoming Franco-African summit, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The message was delivered by Libyan Ambassador to France Ali
Triki to Mubarak, who is in Paris to attend the summit, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who is accompanying Mubarak, told
MENA.
</P>
<P>
Terming the message as "urgent," Moussa said that it deals with
the 20th Franco-African, summit due to open later Friday. But he
refrained from elaborating on the details of the message.
</P>
<P>
France did not invite Libya to attend the summit due to
international sanctions on the North African country.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has been on good terms with Gaddafi, and visited him in
July after the Libyan leader broke his femur while practicing
routine sports exercises.
</P>
<P>
Libya remains under a U.N. air and arms embargo, approved by
the Security Council in 1992 for its refusal to hand over two
suspects in blowing up Pan Am 103 flight in 1988 over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Libya has agreed to a compromise arrangement to try the
suspects in the Hague, the Netherlands, by Scottish judges
according to Scottish laws. The council promised to suspend the
sanctions once Libya turns the men over.
</P>
<P>
But Libya demanded that legal and security detailed be worked
out before it finally surrenders the two suspects. Efforts are
still under way by Arab and African countries to find an
acceptable solution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak arrived in Paris on Wednesday to start his second trip
to France this year after a state visit in May. This is the first
time he attends the Franco-African summit, which will focus on
peace and development of Africa.

<HEADLINE> Chairman's Menu (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Feeling encouraged, Tang moved her stand near Mao's old house
and offered boiled water and souvenirs in addition to the soup,
which would earn her about 10 yuan (a little more than one
U.S. dollar) a day.
</P>
<P>
Although the idea of having a private business had been
accepted and was put into practice in many parts of China at that
time, it was still meeting with resistance in Shaoshan, where the
idea of public ownership still prevailed. And, for quite some
time, Tang was an easy target of criticism and gossip.
</P>
<P>
But the situation changed, and the reforms and opening up
slowly began to take root in Shaoshan and people there began to
follow Tang's example.
</P>
<P>
Then, taking her savings from three years of selling outdoors,
Tang opened a restaurant in 1986 and named it after the late
Chairman. It has gained a reputation for four dishes: stewed pork,
baked fish, home-cured meats, and fermented soy beans, which are
said to have been most favored by Mao.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman's menu, when combined with local rice wine and
tea, have attracted tourists from all over. In the past decade,
Tang's restaurant has had over 300,000 guests from all over China
and abroad. And, she has opened 16 other restaurants in other
parts of China.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, our people were talking politics on the one hand,
and begging for government assistance on the other," Tang says,
"It was after we abandoned old concepts and ideas that we became
better-off."
</P>
<P>
Shaoshan now has more than 200 restaurants and hotels. Half of
the households are involved in private businesses that brought per
capita incomes to 5,200 yuan last year, from less than 100 in
1978.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Tang set up an education fund of 100,000 yuan to help
poor rural students, and in the past several years, has donated
some 800,000 yuan to various social welfare projects.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Assembly Elects Commissions Chairmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's National
Assembly finished its work Friday afternoon of electing nine
chairmen of its key permanent committee's nine commissions.
</P>
<P>
In a deal they had reached, the Cambodian People's Party (CPP)
and FUNCINPEC are equally dividing eight commissions, leaving one
for the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP).
</P>
<P>
The four commissions chaired by the CPP are human rights,
finance, social and women's affairs and education while FUNCINPEC
is in charge of legislation, economy and investment, interior and
defense, and foreign affairs. The commission of public works and
transportation has been offered to the SRP.
</P>
<P>
The nine chairmen plus the president and two vice presidents of
the parliament consists of the assembly's key permanent committee.
</P>
<P>
In the National Assembly, the 12-member committee has the power
to decide what legislation gets through to the floor of the
parliament and what gets buried.
</P>
<P>
A summit chaired by King Norodom Sihanouk two weeks ago
resulted in a breakthrough in the tense and political deadlock
which lasted for four months, paving the way for Wednesday's
parliamentary step to form the new government. A CPP-FUNCINPEC
deal had been struck making the CPP's Hun Sen the country's prime
minister and FUNCINPEC's Prince Ranariddh the assembly president.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's new coalition government will be formed on November
30 after the assembly approved Hun Sen's cabinet and its political
platform.
</P>
<P>
King Norodom Sihanouk already issued a royal decree from
Beijing Wednesday appointing Hun Sen prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Weaker on Quiet Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar faded
Friday to close weaker after a dreary session, following a holiday
on U.S. markets Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Amid light trading a small sell order early Friday morning sent
the domestic currency lower and it did not recover the ground
during the day, MMS Standard and Poor's currency strategist Alex
Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed at 63.58 U.S. cents from 63.78 Thursday,
after spending the day between 63.48 and 63.28.
</P>
<P>
"It's been deadly quiet," Douglas said of the day's trading.
</P>
<P>
"First thing this morning there was a small selling order out
of the United States but seeing as liquidity has been so low, even
small orders have been capable of moving the market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Douglas said a speech Friday morning by Reserve Bank of
Australia Governor Ian Macfarlane did not impact on the markets
but could be taken as supporting an easing in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"If you read between the lines he was talking quite positively
about our floating exchange rate system and what a good thing it
has been for us during the Asian crisis because the weaker dollar
has helped to keep our exports competitive, and so on," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Macfarlane was obviously singing the praises of a weaker
Aussie and I guess if you read between the lines he might be
saying there's some potential for an easing."
</P>
<P>
Douglas said all eyes would now be on the RBA's monthly board
meeting next Tuesday and any movement on interest rates in the
second half of the week.
</P>
<P>
The RBA last reduced rates on July 30, 1997, by 50 basis points
to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Also next week the Australian Bureau of Statistics will release
a raft of data likely to be closely watched by market
participants.
</P>
<P>
On Monday balance on goods and services data will be released.
</P>
<P>
Current account figures, retail trade numbers and building
approvals are due Tuesday and the September quarter domestic
economic growth figures will be released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the cross rates the Australian dollar was buying
78.03 Japanese yen from 77.51 Thursday and 1.0821 German marks
from 1.0866.

<HEADLINE> Syrian, Lebanese Heads Discuss South Lebanon Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Amid escalating violence in
south Lebanon, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad Friday contacted
his Lebanese counterpart Emile Lahoud to discuss the imminent
situation.
</P>
<P>
The Orient radio reported that their talks on the phone focused
on the regional situation, especially the mounting tension between
Israeli occupation forces and their nemesis, Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday night, two more Israeli soldiers were killed by
roadside bombs planted by the militant resistance group Hezbollah,
or Party of God, inside the occupied zone, bringing the death toll
of Israeli soldiers to seven in the past 10 days, and to 23 since
the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
This was the third bloody blow Israeli forces suffered in 10
days. The previous two were in November 16 and 25, in which
Hezbollah's bomb attacks killed five Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim group reportedly backed by Iran
and Syria, is spearheading a guerrilla war in south Lebanon trying
to dislodge 1,000 Israeli occupation forces and its proxy South
Lebanon Army militia.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon in 1985, after two invasions, as a "security zone"
claimed to buffer its northern areas from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud and Assad stressed in their phone discussions that the
two countries will keep full coordination to face Israel's
possible moves.
</P>
<P>
Syria, with 40,000 troops deployed in Lebanon as peacekeepers,
is the main power broker in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had cut
short his European tour and flew back home from London to hold an
emergency cabinet session to discuss the worsening situation in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The heavy losses of life of Israeli soldiers have fueled heated
debate over whether it is wise to keep Israeli presence in south
Lebanon, and reinforced the voice calling for a unilateral
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government on April 1 decided to accept the
U.N. resolution 425, but insisted that a pullout can only happen
after Lebanon makes arrangements to guarantee Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria firmly rejected the offer and demanded Israel
pull out immediately and unconditionally, as asked by the
resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Israel accused Syria of holding south Lebanon as a bargaining
chip to force Israel to return the Golan Heights it captured from
Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.

China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have to make their way
down a zigzagging mountain path every day to reach the only
primary school available for several villages.
</P>
<P>
One of them, Li Tianjing, a member of the Zhuang ethnic
minority, says, "My only wish is to go to college so that I can

Education is still one of the most viable ways for young people
here to get somewhere in the future, so Li's parents are willing
to borrow money to pay for their four children's education.
</P>
<P>
Yao Anhua, a farmer, says, "We will help the children finish
their education even if we have to beg for the money. A good
education will give them a good job."
</P>
<P>
Lan Weiliu, the principal of the Du'an Yao Minority Secondary
School, says that the students come from nine ethnic minority
groups. The school decided to recruit these children in spite of
their low grades because of the difficulties ethnic minority
children face in getting an education.

The officials of the autonomous region have long known that it
is more dangerous to be backward in education than it is
economically, so they have been trying to solve this problem
themselves instead of relying completely on the Central Government.

Courses in ethnic minority secondary schools are more or less
the same as those in schools for Han (China's ethnic majority)
students, except for courses on the history of their ethnic
group. And in many primary schools, courses are not taught in
standard Chinese, but in their own language.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Keen to Promote Stability in Africa: Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has expressed keenness on promoting stability in the African
continent, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Egyptian reporters accompanying him on a trip to
Paris Thursday, Mubarak said that Egypt is eager to see all the
African problems solved and peace and stability prevailing on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is in Paris to attend the 20th Franco-African summit
due in the day on peace and development of African countries.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Mubarak attends the summit and his
second trip to France after his state visit in May.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that Egypt is aware of the problems facing African
countries, especially those of conflicts and instability.
</P>
<P>
Also, Mubarak denied some Sudanese reports alleging that Egypt
has arrested and tried a number of Sudanese nationals for
espionage charges in Halaib, a border triangle disputed by the two
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, diplomats at the meeting said Mubarak is expected to
mediate in the armed conflicts in the Democratic Republic of
Congo, which threatens a wider conflict after its neighbors
dispatched troops to join the country's civil war.

<HEADLINE> Chairman Mao's Menu Means More Money For His Hometown (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A restaurant by a lotus pond
and with a full view of the childhood home of Mao Zedong, the
founder of the People's Republic of China, has a tempting and
tasty dish, stewed pork, that is thought to be the late chairman's
favorite.
</P>
<P>
Tang Ruiren, the restaurant's owner, is in her early 70s. But,
she's still busy talking with visitors or posing for pictures with
them. She has risen to a sort of local stardom in about a decade,
as the first person to become prosperous here in Shaoshan, a small
town in Hunan Province in central China.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years ago, when Tang started her own business here in
the birthplace of the late chairman, she encountered a great deal
of resistance. "Many people were quite upset when the reforms and
opening-up were first introduced in Shaoshan," Tang explains,
because they were asking themselves whether the country was still
on the socialist track that the late Chairman had laid.
</P>
<P>
Some even wept when collectively-owned farmland was divided up
and allotted to various households of peasant farmers, Tang
recalls. But, she had injured one leg on a water conservation
project in the '60s and had difficulty working in the fields, so
she began to think about a way to make money. After all, by that
time, quite a number of people in southern coastal areas had
already got rich by starting their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
Then, one day, in the summer of 1983, Tang took a pot of soup
to the roadside to sell -- without telling her family. "My heart
was beating so wildly when I saw people approaching my stand that
I ran and hid behind the slope," she says.
</P>
<P>
One hungry traveler, spying the pot of soup, called out for the
owner. Still hiding, Tang shouted back in a muffled voice, telling
him to help himself.
</P>
<P>
The traveler then asked her the price. Tang could only answer,
"Whatever you like. It's okay if you don't want to pay."
</P>
<P>
Obviously startled and a bit sympathetic, the traveler said in
a Shanghai accent that she needn't feel ashamed about selling
soup. "Time has changed," he told her, "and so must your point of
view."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Company Signs Mining Agreement With Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar mining authorities
and a company in China's Liaoning reached an agreement here Friday
on mineral prospecting, exploration and feasibility study for
developing gold and copper deposits in the country's northern
Kachin state.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony of the agreement between the Department of
Geological Survey and Mineral Exploration (DGSME) of the Myanmar
Ministry of Mines and the Liaoning Jin Di Construction Consortium
Co., Ltd. of China was attended by Myanmar Minister of Mines
Brigadier-General Ohn Myint, Vice Secretary General of the
Liaoning Provincial People's Government Yu Fengsheng and Economic
and Commercial Counselor of the Chinese Embassy Lin Jian.
</P>
<P>
Representing the respective parties, Director-General of DGSME
U Soe Myint and Vice President Han Zhiming of the Chinese company
signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
This is the first agreement for a Chinese company to carry out
mineral prospecting and exploration in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more than a dozen foreign companies including
those from Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand
and the United States have been participating in mineral
extraction in Myanmar, with Canadian companies specializing in
copper mining.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, foreign investment in
Myanmar's mining sector amounted to 501.36 million U.S. dollars in
43 related projects at the end of May this year.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics also show that the output value of
Myanmar's mining sector rose 1.5 percent in the 1997-98 fiscal
year which ended in March as compared with the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Backs Reopening of Aquino Assassination Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada expressed his support Friday for a call by Benigno
"Noynoy" Aquino for the reopening of the case on his father's
assassination.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters here, Estrada expressed his hope
that the identities of the mastermind of the crime will be
uncovered during his administration.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada stressed the need to finally resolve the
case, and "put the issue that has divided the nation behind us."
</P>
<P>
Former Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. was assassinated on August
21, 1983, upon his return from the United States during the Marcos
administration, which blamed the killing on Rolando Galman, a
civilian.
</P>
<P>
However, the Aquino family refused to accept President
Ferdinand Marcos' explanation for the assassination. Aquino
supporters insisted that it was the late president and his armed
forces chief of staff, the late Gen. Fabian Ver, who masterminded
the crime.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would back up the move to reopen the
assassination case, President Estrada said, "Why not? I will fully
support it. I hope it will be solved during my administration."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the president appealed to persons who may
have direct knowledge of the events that transpired leading to the
assassination to come forward and shed light on the case.
</P>
<P>
He said that once identified, the mastermind of the crime will
be sentenced in court and jailed, so the entire country "can
finally leave behind the issue that has divided our people over
the last 15 years."

PARIS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
opened the 20th Franco-African summit in Paris Friday morning with
the theme of building a pan-African security mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three African heads of state, including President
Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo, are attending
the conference which is expected to see strong diplomatic maneuver
for helping solve the conflict in the DR Congo.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Chirac called on Africa to build a
peace-keeping mechanism to cope with the crises in the region with
the support of the international community.
</P>
<P>
To build security, in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, is
first of all trying to prevent crises. It is also building a
system for solving conflicts which will rely on all the
understanding and support available, reinforced by a resolved
engagement of the international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
France, which is scaling down its military deployment in
Africa, is cooperating with the United States in training
peace-keeping capacities of African countries.
</P>
<P>
With its new African policy of "neither indifference, nor
interference," France has been reducing its political engagement
in Africa for years.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Developing Ship-to-Ship Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korea is developing a
ship-to-ship missile with a range of about 200 kilometers, the
Defense Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first ship-to-ship missile development program
unveiled by South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The Harpoon-class missile development will be finished by the
year 2003 at a total cost of 100 billion won (about 80 million
U.S. dollars), said a spokesman for the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-made Harpoon ship-to-ship missiles are the major
outfit on South Korean destroyers and frigates.
</P>
<P>
A portable defense missile, with a range of 3-5 kilometers,
similar to the U.S. Stinger and French Mistral missile, is
also being developed, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry also said it has succeeded in developing
new 155-mm self-propelled artillery.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has already started mass production of the
self-propelled artillery for deployment to army units next year,
which will pour 106.4 billion won (about 85.1 million dollars)
into the program in the coming two years.
</P>
<P>
The self-propelled artillery can hit targets 40 kilometers away
and carry 50 rounds of 155-mm shells.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Japanese Party Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin met here on Friday with leaders of Japanese major political
parties to exchange views on the development the relations between
China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the Japanese party leaders that the main purpose of
his visit is to discuss with Japan's government and party leaders
on the ways to enhance Sino-Japanese friendly ties oriented toward
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and he have agreed to
establish a friendly cooperative partnership dedicated to peace
and development in their frank talks held on Thursday, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
This is in the fundmental interests of the two countries and
the two peoples, and also conforms to the trend of the times, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Among those who met Jiang were the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party leaders Yoshiro Mori, Yukihiko Ikeda, Takashi Fukatani, head
of the Democratic Party of Japan Kan Naoto, New Komeito leader
Takenori Kanzaki, Liberal Party head Ichiro Ozawa, Social
Democratic Party Chairwoman Doi Takako and Japanese Communist
Party Presidium Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan, two neighbors separated only by a strip of
water, have a long history of friendship which is not often seen
in the history of the relations among different countries in the
world, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The unfortunate history between the two countries in the
contemporary times was caused by aggressive wars against China
launched by Japan's militarists, which has not only inflicted
great sufferings on the Chinese people, but also made Japanese
people victims, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Today's friendly Sino-Japanese ties are hard-won thanks to the
joint efforts by the older-generation of statesmen and those with
insight in both countries, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Past experiences should be remembered and serve as a guide for
the future, Jiang said, adding that China has two basic views on
Sino-Japanese ties.
</P>
<P>
One is facing up history and taking lessons from history, the
other is adopting an attitude toward the future and making joint
efforts to open up the future, Jiang explained.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two basic points are important not only to
the stable development of the bilateral relations and long-term
friendship between the two peoples, but also to peace and
development in Asia and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the two countries should educate their young
generations with a correct understanding of history and further
boost exchanges between them as they hold the future of the
Sino-Japanese friendship.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also expressed the hope that Japanese
party leaders could continue their efforts to play an active role
in promoting the development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Japanese political parties told Jiang that
they support the development of all-round friendly cooperative
ties with China and would continuously make efforts to expand them.
</P>
<P>
Yoshiro Mori hoped that the two countries, on the basis of frank
exchange of views on important issues relating to bilateral
relations, could join hands to contribute to peace and prosperity
in Asia and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Naoto Kan said that Japan should have a clear and definite
recognition of history and look into the future on the basis of
expressing remorse over history.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is one part of China, Japan should not support Taiwan's
independence, Kan said, adding that he hopes China could realize
reunification peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Japan's correct understanding on history is a basis for
Japan-China friendship, Takenori Kanzaki said. He added that
Japan should make deep remorse for its past aggression against
China and will never walk along the road of militarism.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa said that it is of great significance for President Jiang
to visit Japan at the 20th anniversary of the signing of the
China-Japan Peace and Friendship Treaty. He hopes sincerely that
Japan and China can establish a truly long-term relationship of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Fuwa said that a right understanding of historical issues and
correctly dealing with the Taiwan issue are the important
foundation for the development of Japanese-Chinese ties. It is the
key point that Japanese government will stick to the promises made
in the joint statement issued after the talks between Jiang and
Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
Doi said that it is an old saying in China that the past should
not be forgotten as it serves as a lesson to the future. There is
also an old saying in Japan that if you close eyes to the past you
will not see the future.
</P>
<P>
She reiterated that her Social Democratic Party holds that
Taiwan is a part of China and this stance will not be
changed.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Horses Fail Asian Games Health Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's dreams of winning
medals at the Asian Games equestrian competition was blown away as
their horses failed strict health tests, organisers said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Asiad is the first Asian Games in which
equestrian competitors have been allowed to bring their own
horses. After their horses failed the test, the Iranian
equestrian team have to pull-out of the competition.
</P>
<P>
"We could not allow Iran's horses into the competition
because it could jeopardise the health status of the other
horses," said Dr. Siraya Chunekamrai, president of the Asian
Games Veterinary Commission.
</P>
<P>
The horses, which flew in from the United States, are
currently been stabled well away from the Asian Games equestrian
site before being returned home, said the organisers in the
statement.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Lanka's Economy Grows Modestly, Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Through disciplined and
prudent financial management, Sri Lanka has been largely spared
the economic crisis spreading across the globe and continues its
modest economic growth.
</P>
<P>
This year, Sri Lanka expects to achieve a 5.1 percent growth in
GDP, a 23 percent rise in foreign direct investment and a 6
percent increase in export while recording an inflation rate of
10.3 percent compared with 13.4 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists paint a gloomier picture of the
economy for the future despite the respectable growth rates.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's export of three main commodities fell sharply in
August. Export of tea fell by 5 percent, rubber by 38.3 percent
and coconut by 12 percent. Gem exports fell sharply by 71 percent
while garment exports dropped by 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists here say the August figures showed an alarming
turning- point for the Sri Lankan economy.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, striving to set the pace for regional development,
has adopted an opening policy, which is reflected by its tariff
reforms aiming to attract foreign investments, and its active
pursuit of business opportunities with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Guided by a liberalized trade policy, Sri Lanka has been
successfully carrying out its tariff reforms by simplifying the
tariff system and progressively reducing non-tariff barriers, the
direct result of which is a well defined narrow list of
quantitative restrictions on foreign trade and an investment
commitment of 2.1 billion U.S. dollars in 18 projects this year.
</P>
<P>
Various incentives and minimized administrative problems or
delays have made such viable industries as textiles, wearing
apparel and leather commercially attractive to foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
There are also opportunities in the areas of services,
infrastructural development, electronic industries and
construction.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been able to add such export products as magnetic
heads for reading floppy disks to its traditional export goods of
tea, rubber and coconut.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid development and increased investment, Sri Lanka
has found itself in need of improved infrastructure and
communications. Therefore, the government has been encouraging
private sector involvement in developing commercial infrastructure
facilities such as thermal and hydro power generation,
telecommunications, port development, highways and industrial
parks and townships.
</P>
<P>
These measures have paid off. The Public Enterprises Reforms
Commission generated 330 million dollars, or 11.5 percent of the
government's total receipts this year, thus enabling part of the
public debt to be retired and the debt portfolio to be
restructured.
</P>
<P>
Besides, electricity generation increased by 11 percent this
year, transshipment container handling rose by 26 percent and the
number of ships calling at the Colombo port increased by 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists attribute Sri Lanka's immunity from
the Southeast Asian financial crisis to unusually high tea prices
earlier this year, and believe the economy is running out of
steam.
</P>
<P>
Sisira Jayasuriya, an analyst at the private think tank
Institute of Policy Studies, said: "We are generally in a
deflationary environment and the global economy is going into
depression. In that context there is no way Sri Lanka is going to
avoid getting into a serious situation."
</P>
<P>
Politicians from the opposition as well as government officials
privately agree that the economy is heading for a major crisis
because of falling tea prices and the possible decline in job
opportunities for Sri Lankans in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Falling oil prices have helped Sri Lanka reduce its import bill
but at the same time the lower incomes in oil-producing countries
would make it difficult for them to employ Sri Lankan labor, the
country's major foreign currency earner, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the general public did not seem to be impressed by
the 1999 budget unveiled by the government recently, which puts
revenues at 3.64 billion dollars and expenditures at 5.11 billion
dollars with a deficit of 1.47 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Even the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which generally
makes an upbeat assessment of Sri Lanka's economic performance,
believes that growth figures as well as revenue projections in the
budget are overoptimistic.
</P>
<P>
Anton Op De Beke, the IMF representative in Colombo, said the
staggering defense expenditure coupled with falling revenues
affected the upbeat projections made in the budget.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes to raise 30 percent more revenues through
the Goods and Service Tax next year but there was nothing to back
up the expected revenue growth, he added.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu to Hurry Home as More Killed in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu will cut off his trip to Europe and fly home
from London Friday following the killing of two more Israeli
soldiers in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the two soldiers were killed during
a patrol in south Lebanon Thursday night when two bombs exploded
under their armored vehicles. The previous night two other soldiers
were also killed in a bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
The militant resistance group Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
claimed responsibility for the bombing attacks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had been scheduled to visit Spain following his trip
to London. But he sent a message of regrets to his Spanish
counterpart on Thursday and canceled the visit.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that Netanyahu will convene his cabinet on
Sunday to discuss the situation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
And the discussions will be carried out on two levels, with one
being a serious assessment of the tactics and strategies of
Israeli troops in south Lebanon, and the other working on reaching
a long-term solution involving a withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel established a self-styled "security zone" in south
Lebanon in 1985 after two invasions, with the claimed aim of
protecting its northern area from cross-border guerrilla raids.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Iranian Hezbollah and other guerrilla groups have
engaged Israeli occupation forces in a war of attrition, in a bid
to drive them out of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, 23 Israelis have been killed
in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The heavy casualties have fueled heated debate over if it is wise
to keep Israeli presence in Lebanon, and reinforced the voice
calling for a unilateral withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government on April 1 decided to accept the
U.N. resolution 425, but insisted that the pullout can only happen
after Lebanon makes arrangements to guarantee Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
Beirut regards the Israeli demand ridiculous, urging the Jewish
state to exit south Lebanon unconditionally as asked by the
resolution 425.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Facilitate Sale of State-run Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian government has decided
to organize and facilitate the purchase of shares of companies to
be listed in the stock exchange in a further bid to attract
investments.
</P>
<P>
The decision, announced Thursday by Minister of Economy Youssef
Boutros Ghali, is part of Egypt's efforts to privatize its
state-run enterprises, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision makes it obligatory for an investor to buy 15
percent of a company's shares, and the rest are for selective
purchase, sources of the Economy Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The decision also regulates the means, terms and measures,
through which investors should publicize their interest in buying
company shares.
</P>
<P>
And investors should advertise their purchase bids on two
widely circulated Egyptian daily newspapers so as to guarantee
transparency and equality.
</P>
<P>
Egypt started the economic reforms in 1991, preparing a list of
314 state-run businesses for privatization by selling shares
directly to investors.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Finance Minister Mohi Eddin Al-Gharib said Thursday
that so far one third of the selected state-run enterprises have
been sold, and the rest will be put on sale in three years.
</P>
<P>
The reforms have born fruits. Since 1991, Egypt's annual gross
domestic product (GDP) growth rate have increased from 2 percent
to more than 5 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has fallen under 4 percent and foreign currency
reserves stood at 20 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> ADB: Crisis Remains Source of Uncertainty in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) said Friday that the financial and exchange rate crisis
remains the main source of uncertainty in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In an economic outlook report released here, the bank said that
while some currency and equity markets staged partial recoveries
in 1998 and current accounts moved into the black, conditions
continued to deteriorate in many areas of the real economy.
</P>
<P>
"For example," it said, "bad loan rates kept rising in 1998 as
corporate failures exacerbated banking sector problems, even as
many Asian countries initiated significant financial sector
reforms."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, policy makers faced narrowed sets of
alternatives and many felt forced to choose between growth and
stability.
</P>
<P>
"The speed and volatility of the Asian crisis makes it
difficult to forecast how long it will take for fresh portfolio
capital and banking credit to begin flowing again to emerging
markets," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said financial markets in Asia itself are not the only
source of uncertainty in the region.
</P>
<P>
Integrated global capital markets transmit financial contagion
almost instantaneously around the globe, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said Brazil and Russia are two developing economies
outside the Asian region with demonstrated potential to disrupt
Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
"If, despite generous assistance from the International
Monetary Fund, Brazil lost the battle to defend its currency, the
impact on Asia would be considerable," it said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said developments in industrialized countries are also
likely to affect prospects for Asia's recovery.

<HEADLINE> India Takes Measures to Check Price Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee announced Friday a five-point plan to check the
spiraling prices of essential commodities including restructuring
the cabinet committee on prices.
</P>
<P>
During a conference of chief ministers to review the price
situation, Vajpayee proposed to restructure the committee and make
it more functional for enabling timely and monthly reviews on
prices and corrective action.
</P>
<P>
The rime minister said he would set up a group of officials
under the cabinet secretary to make suitable recommendations on
the amendment of Essential Commodities Act and on the steps needed
to improve the enforcement mechanism in the country to check
hoarding and black marketeering.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India (PTI), a special cell
would also be set up under the cabinet secretariat to monitor and
analyze price data and trends of essential commodities.
</P>
<P>
Prices of essential commodities in the country have gone up
sharply since the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to
power in March this year especially sine last May when India
conducted five nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Terming rising prices as a national problem, Vajpayee asked
political parties not to politicize the issue, saying a spirit of
cooperation and sharing of responsibility alone could help his
government evolve long-term, medium-term and immediate strategies
to stabilize and reduce price.
</P>
<P>
During a month-long campaign for the just-ended elections to
the assemblies in four states, the opposition Congress party
fiercely attacked the BJP-led government for the price rises and
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee underlined the need for early establishment of a
national crop forecasting center and said action on this need
would complete expeditiously by the Agriculture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said a nationwide program to establish efficient and
cost-effective storage facilities is needed urgently to minimize
the high percentage of waste, particularly of fruits and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister blamed the recent spurt in prices mainly on
weather, saying agricultural crops have been hit by bad weather
including heavy and unseasonal rains, severe cold, extreme heat
and floods in some parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> Australian Tourism Industry Urged to Go On-Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Australia's tourism industry
should embrace the marketing tool of the future and go on-line,
federal Tourism Minister Jackie Kelly said Friday.
</P>
<P>
While addressing an industry forum in Sydney, Kelly said the
Internet could provide huge opportunities for the sector,
Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 14 million Americans were already using it to plan their
trips, she said.
</P>
<P>
"While I appreciate that tourism is an industry dominated by
small business and the challenge of new technology is difficult
for some, it is getting simpler and cheaper all the time and will
soon be no different than subscribing to the yellow pages," Kelly
said.
</P>
<P>
"I intend to work closely with the industry to develop an
integrated on-line tourism strategy -- it is time to stop
underestimating the potential of new ideas."
</P>
<P>
She also reiterated the potential opportunities to create
lasting wealth and employment from the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Kelly highlighted the importance of going on-line, as this
Friday (November 27) is being marked nationally as "Online
Australia Day," a special day of events organized by the federal
government's National Office of the Information Economy, designed
to showcase the benefits of the on-line economy in the general
community and the business sector.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Avoid Grain Price Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Grain
Marketing Enterprise said it has started making all necessary
precautions to avoid undue grain price falls that may occur due
to the expected bumper harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
Feleke Wakjira, head of the commercial department of the
enterprise, told reporters that the enterprise has taken the
precautionary measures based on field reports which showed that
considerable harvest will be obtained because of the abundant
rains and the consolidation of the agricultural extension
program, the Ethiopian Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Feleke noted that during the past years the enterprise has
allocated considerable budget for its activities and prepared
grain warehouses with a total storage capacity of one million
tons.
</P>
<P>
He said the enterprise, apart from keeping sufficient reserve
capable of stabilizing the market, has undertaken marketing
studies aimed at enabling the country to export more of its
grain and thereby secure foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is expected to have a bumper harvest in crops this
year due to abundant and timely rainfalls this year, according to
harvesting news from different regions.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Grain Marketing Enterprise helped increase the
earning capacity of farmers by purchasing grain at a price
higher than market when farmers got a good harvest.
</P>
<P>
When the public faced grain shortage in the past years, the
enterprise played considerable role in stabilizing the market by
supplying grain kept in reserve at reasonable price.

<HEADLINE> Oxfam Hong Kong Aids Yunnan Quake Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Oxfam Hong Kong has pledged to
provide 1.7 million yuan in relief funds for an
earthquake-stricken village in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
On November 19, Ninglang Yi Autonomous County was hit by two
earthquakes measuring 5.0 and 6.2 on the Richter Scale. The quakes
left three people dead, injured nearly 1,400, and left about
30,000 people homeless.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Oxfam Hong Kong officials in Kunming went to Ninglang
County and its Lanniqing Village, epicenter of the
earthquakes. The Hong Kong non-governmental organization decided
to offer help after learning of the serious conditions in the
quake-damaged areas.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Oxfam signed a contract to provide relief funds with
the government of Ninglang Autonomous County.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, the 1.7 million yuan (about 205,000
U.S. dollars) will benefit 2,215 households in Lanniqing Village
where houses collapsed or became unlivable after the quakes.
</P>
<P>
Each of the 2,215 families will receive 150 kilograms of rice,
two quilts, two cotton-padded coats, and 94 square meters of woven
fibers for building quake-proof shelters by December 1.
</P>
<P>
Lanniqing Village, the poorest village in Ninglang County,
was hardest hit by the earthquakes as three villagers died, 729 people
were injured and 1,823 families lost their homes.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, when Lijiang in Yunnan Province suffered an
earthquake, Oxfam donated more than four million yuan to Ninglang
Autonomous County. Each year Oxfam donates about one million yuan
to a fund to aid the poor in Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, 1,000 tents, 1,000 tons of
chemical fertilizers, 20,000 kilos of grain, 1,000 cotton-padded
quilts, two tons of medicine and a large quantity of clothing have
all been delivered to the county.
</P>
<P>
But the Ninglang still needs more tents and cotton-padded quilts
to help settle the victims, many of whom are now forced to sleep
in the open.

<HEADLINE> World Heritage Chief Rejects Australia's Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 27 (Xinhua) --The Australian government's
criticism of a report on the Kakadu National Park was
extraordinary, head of the World Heritage mission to Kakadu,
Francesco Francioni, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The World Heritage Committee report found the Jabiluka uranium
mine threatened the surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area and
raised the prospect of Kakadu being placed on the committee's
endangered list.
</P>
<P>
Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill blasted the report
as biased and unbalanced and said the mine would go ahead anyway.
</P>
<P>
The report is due to go before the World Heritage Committee
Bureau meeting in Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
While talking over ABC Radio from Tokyo, Francioni rejected
Hill's claim that the mission's report was full of contradictions.
</P>
<P>
He said the recommendations were designed to remove real and
potential dangers from one of Australia's most famous national
parks.
</P>
<P>
He said the majority of the drafting group reflected the views
of the report.
</P>
<P>
"I find it quite extraordinary that this language is used,
especially since I personally ensured that the mission cooperated
and remained open to any kind of input and any kind of interaction
with the Australian government."
</P>
<P>
The World Heritage convention was supposed to be an instrument
of cooperation and not a forum for adversary politics, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government has already insisted that Jabiluka
remain open, which would almost certainly see Kakadu placed on the
endangered list if the World Heritage Committee accepts the report
of its mission to Australia.

<HEADLINE> ADB: Southeast Asia Still at Vortex of Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian economies
remained at the vortex of the Asian financial crisis in 1998 and
the outlook for 1999 depends on the fate of current reform
initiatives and the mood of world capital market, the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) said.
</P>
<P>
In a report released at the Asian Economic Outlook workshop
here Friday, the Manila-based bank said that after a 4-percent
growth in 1997, the region contracted by about 7 percent in 1998,
underperforming even the most pessimistic expectations for the
year.
</P>
<P>
"Over 30 billion dollars fled Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and
the Philippines in 1997 and 1998," the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said Indonesia continued to bear the brunt of the
crisis, as exports and investment collapsed, reducing output by
more than 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thailand implemented a series of financial reforms but still
suffered a 7-percent contraction, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said Malaysia at first appeared to avoid the worst effects
of the crisis, but capital outflows late in the year brought
growth down to minus 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the bank said, its relatively low level of
financial leverage and continued strong export demand helped save
it from some of the worst effects of the crisis and its economy is
expected to grow 0.2 percent this year and 1 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
On the situation of the corporate and banking sectors, the bank
said that at the end of 1998, Indonesia's non-performing loans
could rise to 35 percent of loans outstanding, followed by
Thailand at 30 percent, Malaysia at 25 percent and the Philippines
at 10 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
On the prospects for the sub-region in 1999, the bank said the
outlook depends on the fate of economic reforms in these countries
and world capital markets.
</P>
<P>
"Restructuring and recapitalization of banks and firms will be
high on the priority list," it added.
</P>
<P>
The bank predicted a 0.4-percent negative growth for the
sub-region in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the social impact of the crisis, the bank said the
cost has been "substantial."
</P>
<P>
About 48 percent of Indonesia's population of over 200 million
was estimated to be living in poverty in 1998, up from only 11
percent in 1996, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment rates rose to 7 percent in Malaysia, 9 percent in
Indonesia, 8 percent in Thailand and 13 percent in the
Philippines, according to the bank.

<HEADLINE> Investors Urged to Mine In Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Foreign and local investors
have been challenged to venture into Zambia's gemstone mining if
they are to achieve maximum financial benefit.
</P>
<P>
Margaret Mwanakatwe, acting director-general of Zambia
Investment Center (ZIC), said in a latest issue of Zambian
Investor magazine that apart from copper mining, other
opportunities exist in the mining sector and the greatest
potential lies in the gemstone sector, government-owned Zambia
Daily Mail reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
She noted that it is up to investors to venture into the
country's gemstone industry which has an international advantage
if they are to make benefit.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's gemstone sector that includes emeralds, amethyst,
aquamarine and tourmaline, garnets and rose quartz has great
potential, said the ZIC chief.
</P>
<P>
She added that Zambia's export value of emeralds is currently
estimated at 200 million U.S. Dollars per year which is about 20
percent of the world's production.
</P>
<P>
This sector, however, has been adversely hampered by a lack of
serious investment and is generally run by small companies and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
Mwanakatwe noted that Zambia now needs serious foreign players
who will establish as partners to existing domestic investors in
order to increase production and process the gemstones for added
value.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has other viable mineral endowments which include
cobalt, ferrous metals and precious metals, she said.

<HEADLINE> New Web Site Helps Parents Police Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Parents who have only just
figured out how to switch a computer on have been given a helping
hand with the launch of the "Australian Families Guide to the
Internet" Friday.
</P>
<P>
Developed by the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA), the
site, located at www.aba.gov.au/family, provides parents with
information on risks, parenting tips, suggested rules and
information on technical tools.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of the site is to provide parents and carers
with information and tools so that they can guide their children
toward a rewarding, productive and safe experience of the Internet
-- even if they don't know much about the Internet itself," ABA
chairman David Flint said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet is opening up a new world for children and is
likely to change the way we communicate, entertain ourselves,
study and work in the future.
</P>
<P>
"This is a challenge for parents who may be struggling to keep
abreast with these technological changes."
</P>
<P>
And for parents who are still looking for that elusive switch,
the ABA has also produced a brochure with the information in a
printed form.

<HEADLINE> ADB: China's Performance Much Better Than Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Despite a drop in foreign
export demand and foreign investment, China's economic performance
in 1998 is "substantially better" than most of its neighbors, the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"China's growth slowed in 1998, largely due to a drop in
foreign export demand," the ADB said in a report released at the
Asian Economic Outlook Workshop here.
</P>
<P>
China's export growth, which averaged 20 percent over the last
five years, registered a mere 2-percent increase in 1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The slowdown reflected sharply lower demand from Japan and the
rest of Asia," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Although the drop in export demand reduced its trade surplus
from the previous year, the bank said, China still managed a
surplus on the current account for the fifth consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment inflows fell slightly, but at 38
billion U.S. dollars they were still the second largest in the
world -- after the United States, it said.
</P>
<P>
"China's capital controls helped save it from the large capital
outflows experienced throughout Asia. That contributed to an
increase in the reserve stock to 140 billion dollars, also second
largest in the world -- after Japan," the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ADB projection, China's gross domestic product
will grow 6.5 percent this year and 6 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook for China next year is positive with continued
growth in the six-percent range expected, inflation will remain
under control and the current account will stay positive," the
bank said.

JERUSALEM, November 27 (Xinhua)-- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated Thursday that
Israel is ready to review security arrangements to pave the way
for an Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking a day after two Israeli soldiers were killed in the
self-styled security zone in south Lebanon, Netanyahu said Israel
would withdraw from Lebanon as soon as a way was found to withdraw
without abandoning the ability to defend its northern areas.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The General Security Service has warned that Netanyahu's
stance on the release of Palestinian prisoners - that criminal
prisoners can be released instead of security ones - could push
Fatah members to extremism and even lead them to resume their
involvement in terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- As Israeli casualties have been mounting in south Lebanon
in the last few weeks, Netanyahu did not rule out the possibility
of a unilateral withdrawal from there.

<HEADLINE> Stiff Witchcraft Law Urged in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian traditionalist has
called for a stiff witchcraft law to protect people from
rampaging witch-finders who are terrorizing villagers of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Friday quoted Pardon Katongo, a
traditionalist, as saying in Ndola, northern Zambia, that the
current law is too weak to check the activities of the
witch-finders.
</P>
<P>
Witch-finding has been commercialized as it has become an easy
source of livelihood for lazy people, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There must be a law to check the activities of these people
who are going round villages grabbing property from innocent
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Katongo made the call after it was reported recently that some
witch-finders rounded up 25 villagers in rural Ndola, and
extorted money and property from their victims leaving them
destitute.
</P>
<P>
He said there is need for a clear policy on witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
"These things were there a long time ago but they were kept in
check by the tough stand taken by the colonial government.
</P>
<P>
"The law has not been amended or strengthened to date and the
witch-finders are taking advantage of that," Katongo said.

<HEADLINE> Young Knowledgeable Monks in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Younger and more knowledgeable
monks have become more common in the major Buddhist temples on
Wutai Mountain, according to Liu Zhimin, the deputy head of the
Religious Affairs Bureau of Shanxi Province, north China.
</P>
<P>
Buddhist temples on Wutai Mountain are more influential than
those on Mount E'mei in Sichuan Province, Jiuhua Mountain in Anhui
Province, or Mount Putuo in Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
A young monk, Zhangmuyang Mulan by his religious name, takes
care of daily affairs at Pusading Temple, one of the most famous
temples on Wutai, even though he is only 29 years old. He began to
be trained in Buddhism in Shanxi in the late 1980s and received 10
years of education.
</P>
<P>
He is not alone. Rurui, 34, has become the abbot of Pushou
Temple on Wutai Mountain and deputy president of the Shanxi
Buddhist Association.
</P>
<P>
"Many monks on Wutai Mountain were illiterate in the past," Liu
said, "very few had a college education." But, a training project
was begun in 1984 and three religious colleges and institutes were
set up.
</P>
<P>
Now, more than 80 of the 1,172 Buddhist monks on Wutai Mountain
have at least two years of college education and three-fourths
have nine years of schooling, and more than 1,100 monks and nuns
have graduated from Shanxi's religious colleges and institutes
since the mid-1980s. These institutions also train persons for
services of the Christian religion.
</P>
<P>
This guarantees the continuity of religions in and outside the
province, Liu explained. Shanxi's population is 31 million and it
has more than 710,000 religious believers, an increase of 430,000
from two decades ago.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Suspends Repatriating Angolan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) has suspended the repatriation of 300,000
Angolan refugees from Angola's neighbors due to continued
fighting in the country.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR spokesman Dominik Bartsch confirmed here Thursday that
UNHCR has decided to indefinitely suspend the repatriation
because of the prevailing insecurity, Times of Zambia reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The continued fighting between the Angolan government and the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) forces
has compelled the UNHCR to close its offices and evacuate staff
members from some provinces of Angola, according to the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR also suspended any form of assistance in the
affected areas depriving 144,000 repatriated refugees of basic
needs, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Since June this year 800 more Angolan refugees have arrived in
Zambia, where there are already about 160,000 refugees from
countries including Angola, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of
Congo.

YANGON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Some big powers want to
dominate other countries for their own interests, a senior
official of Myanmar's State Peace and Development Council (SPDC)
said.
</P>
<P>
"In the comity of world nations, each nation strives for its

friendly relations among themselves on the basis of equality and
build their own nations relying on their own resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
"That is the practice truly as a sovereign state in accord with
Myanmar's independent and active foreign policy, freely exercising
its legitimate right to build our own nation relying on our own
resources in conformity with traditions of our country and
nationality, culture and customs, to promote the interests of our
own country and our own nationality," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Myanmar had lagged behind in development because of
armed insurgency, so the SPDC has been wiping out the legacy of
colonialism and carrying out nation-building works with momentum.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1988, a total of 17 anti-government ethnic armed
groups in the country have made peace with the government.
</P>
<P>
The government said it allows the turned-in armed groups to
retain their weapons for "self-protection and area-defense."

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were
killed and another two wounded by two roadside bombs in south
Lebanon overnight, the Orient radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Lebanese guerrilla sources as saying that the
two bombs were detonated when two Israeli armored personnel
carriers passed by on the road of the village of Bilat in the
eastern sector of the Israeli occupied zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attack, saying its operation hit all
Israelis inside the tanks.
</P>
<P>
This is the third bloody blow Israeli forces suffered in 10
days. In Hezbollah's two roadside bombs on November 16 and 25,
five soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
The frequent use of bombs by Hezbollah, responsible for the
death of 18 Israeli soldiers out of a total of 20 killed in south
Lebanon since the beginning of this year, has drawn Israeli army's
concern and revived heated debate over its presence there.
</P>
<P>
Israel's army intelligence chief Major General Amos Malka has
said that the ambushes posed a serious threat to Israeli forces
who have to constantly seek new methods of detection and
prevention.
</P>
<P>
Although the voice calling for an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon is growing, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's government insists that the pullout must be
accompanied by Lebanon's guarantee for the security of Israel's
north.
</P>
<P>
Beirut says that the resistance movement will continue until
all Israeli troops leave the country without any preconditions as
called for by the United Nations Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israel's occupation forces and
their allied South Lebanon Army militia.

<HEADLINE> (with photos) Scientists: Oldest Flower on Earth in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Wu Xiaojun and Chen Mengyang
</P>
<P>
NANJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese and American
researches have identified the world oldest flowering plant, a
scrap of vegetation believed to have been burried by vocanic ashes
145 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
The cover story of today's issue of the United States'
"Science" magazine said that latest research proves that the first
flower on earth blossomed in China, and that their specimens are
unlike any other flowers on record.
</P>
<P>
People can see a spindly twig with peapod-shaped fruit and a
woody stem that looks nothing like a rose, an apple blossom or a
daisy on the fossils unearthed near Beipiao City in northeast
China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
David Dilcher, former vice chairman of the International
Organization of Paleobotany, told Xinhua that "this is the earlist
verified flower in the world."
</P>
<P>
He made these remark during a recent visit to Shenyang, capital
of Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that the discovery is of great importance to
research in the evolution of the earth's environment, and for
modern geology, oil exploration and economic activities.
</P>
<P>
It is widely accepted that flowering plants originated in
tropical zones, and Liaoning is located in the northern temperate
zone.
</P>
<P>
This new discovery pushes the history of flowering plants back
15 to 20 million years earlier than previously believed.
</P>
<P>
The origin of flowering plant has been an issue of debate for
more than 100 years. Naturalist Charles Darwin called it an
"abominable mystery."
</P>
<P>
David Dilcher said he believes that the latest discovery is the
start of the unveiling of the mystery.
</P>
<P>
Sun Ge, researcher at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and
Paleontology attached to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said
around 250,000 kinds of flowering plants are now on earth,
half of all plant varieties.
</P>
<P>
The flowering plants, including most flowers and fruits, have
close links with the evolution of mankind and the earth's
climate. Their appearance is believed to have been a great leap
forward in the history of plant evolution.
</P>
<P>
Sun Zhe, together with Zheng Shaolin and Zhou Zekun, launched
this research project with the help of David Dilcher.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 160 in Train Disaster in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Casualties in the
second-worst train disaster in over a decade in India have gone up
to more than 350 with over 160 others reportedly dead.
</P>
<P>
Exact figures of the dead and those injured are not available
as Friday's newspapers reported the accident from different
sources and the casualties ranged from 300 to 410.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred early Thursday when a south-bound express
train rammed into three derailed coaches near Khanna in northern
Punjab State.
</P>
<P>
Indian President Kocheril Raman Narayanan and Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee sent messages to families of the dead and the
injured, expressing grief at the tragedy and sympathy to the
families.
</P>
<P>
Railway Minister Nitish Kumar, who rushed to the scene Thursday
morning, said there was no mechanism to prevent a freak accident
of this nature.
</P>
<P>
The minister announced extra compensation to the families of
the victims and those injured could get up to 400,000 rupees
(about 9,500 U.S. dollars) each as insurance claim depends on the
nature of injury and disablement.
</P>
<P>
A Statesman daily newspaper correspondent reported from the
spot that the accident site presented a gruesome picture with a
huge pile of steel and iron debris and one engine of the train had
smashed its way through derailed coaches and six bogies of both
trains looked like a mangled mass of steel, twisted out of shape.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported from the spot that
three bogies of the express train named Frontier Mail from Mumbai,
which had left Khanna at 3:10 a.m., derailed and fell on the down
track near a village called Kohri, some four kilometers from
Khanna township.
</P>
<P>
The 3152 express from Jammu rammed into the derailed bogies
with a result that the engine and seven bogies of the train
derailed and six more bogies of the Frontier Mail also went off
the rails, said railway officials in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Statesman said the 3152 express was running at a great
speed and the driver had exchanged OK signals with the Frontier
Mail driver while crossing each other at more than 100 kilometers
per hour.
</P>
<P>
In between, however, part of the Frontier Mail had derailed and
the 3152 express rammed head-on into the derailed bogies, pulling
the bogies behind the engine with it through the derailed train.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the 3152 express died on the spot while the
assistant driver received treatment even as he was trapped inside
the engine till Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Railway Ministry has ordered an investigation by the
commissioner of Railway Safety into the cause of the accident
which is not yet known.
</P>
<P>
Official sources here said a total of 396 train accidents have
taken place since March 1997, the reasons of which were mainly
human failure, equipment failure, sabotage, combination of factors
and incidental causes.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, EC Signs Accord on Anti-Poverty Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and the European
Commission (EC) Thursday signed an agreement here on an
anti-poverty project in the country, an English daily newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which is in the form of a financing
memorandum, the EC will contribute to the project a grant of 1.7
billion taka (35.1 million U.S. dollars), or about 57 percent of
the total cost of the project, over a period of seven years, The
New Nation quoted an official press release as saying.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the anti-poverty project, Adarsha Gram Phase
Two, stands at 3.02 billion taka (62.3 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Landless and homeless people are the poorest segment of the
population in Bangladesh and the Bangladeshi government started
Adarsha Gram Project in 1988, with an aim to provide homeless and
landless families with a homestead in a community on
government-owned land.
</P>
<P>
Each family receives a title deed for their land holding and
assistance in starting up income generating activities, according
to the plan for the project.
</P>
<P>
The EC has been assisting the project since 1990, and the first
phase of its support ended in December 1997 and consisted of a
grant of 631 million taka (13 million dollars) plus 28,500 tons of
food aid, for the creation of 677 villages benefiting 31,206
families.
</P>
<P>
Adarsha Gram Phase Two aims to settle 36,000 families in 650
village communities around the country's three regions of Rangpur,
260 kilometers northwest of here, Barisal, 118 kilometers south of
here and Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the families who are settled can improve their
way of life, particular emphasis will be placed on developing the
villages into viable and sustainable communities.
</P>
<P>
Apart from receiving a title deed for a homestead and
assistance in building a house with a kitchen and latrine,
families will also have access to training in community
organization, trade and business skills and savings and credit
management through local non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The size of each homestead will be 0.048 hectares, providing
families with enough land to plant fruit and vegetables for home
consumption. The families will also benefit from community
facilities and resources such as a community center, tubewells,
social forestry plantations and fishponds.

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis Causes Widespread Regional Contraction:ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) said Friday that the Asian currency crisis has caused a
widespread regional contraction in 1998, and the economy in
developing Asian countries is expected to grow only by 1.8 percent
this year and 3.5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
In a report released at a workshop on Asian Economic Outlook
here Friday, the ADB said the growth rate of gross domestic
product (GDP) in developing Asian economies will decline from 6.1
percent in 1997 to 1.8 percent in 1998, but will grow by 3.5
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the economic slowdown to capital outflows
from the region, lower domestic demand and a large bad debt
problem, all of which were caused by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Private capital flows to emerging Asia, which reached 110
billion U.S. dollars in 1996, turned negative as foreign investors
scrambled to move money out of supposedly risk markets," it said.
</P>
<P>
That forced central banks into monetary contractions, reducing
domestic demand and exacerbating an already large bad debt
problem, it added.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that although currencies remained depreciated
well below their pre-crisis levels, export dollar receipts did not
respond to the exchange rate stimulus as governments and investors
had hoped.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, the bank said, the richer and more open economies
generally did worse during the year.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia remained at the center of the crisis, which
started in July 1997, with Indonesia suffering a huge contraction,
and Thailand and Malaysia hit by substantial declines, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank predicted a negative 6.9 percent GDP growth rate for
Southeast Asia in 1998, and negative 0.4 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Of the four newly industrialized economies, the bank said, only
Taipei, China, weathered the storm with little damage.
</P>
<P>
South Korea suffered a major contraction, or a negative 6.5
percent GDP growth rate in 1998, while China's Hong Kong and
Singapore were unable to avoid the impact of the regional slowdown
on their trade and financial services based economies, the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank said, China and South Asia were less exposed
to international capital flows and so did relatively better.
</P>
<P>
The bank estimated that GDP will grow by 5.1 percent in South
Asia this year.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the states of Central Asia slowed, while Pacific
Island economies as a group grew faster than in the previous year,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said currency devaluations drove up inflation rates in
several crisis-affected Asian countries, and across Asia, the
average rate of consumer price inflation rose to 7.3 percent this
year from 4.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
But current accounts improved throughout the region as capital
flowed out, it said.
</P>
<P>
"From approximate balance in 1997, Asia's aggregate current
account moved to a 2.8 percent of GDP surplus in 1998," it said.
</P>
<P>
Most of that improvement came from import reductions, it added.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Bring Drought-Prone Land Under Irrigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to bring all the land in high drought-prone areas under
supplementary irrigation, a daily newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is a major step taken by the government toward increasing
food production, The Financial Express said.
</P>
<P>
The follow-up steps are under way since the project concept
paper in this regard was approved by the government recently.
</P>
<P>
It will take three years to implement the project, which
involves an expenditure of about 2.2 billion taka (about 45.4
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The permanent gain or achievement of the project will be an
additional food grain production to the tune of 600,000 tons a
year.
</P>
<P>
In the July 1997-June 1998 fiscal year, paddy and wheat
production in the high drought-prone area was recorded at about 2
million tons and the government plans to produce paddy and wheat
to the volume of 2.5 million tons by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mention how many hectares of high
drought-prone areas there are in the country.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the backbone of Bangladesh's economy and no
other sector could see sustainable growth without development in
the agricultural sector.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's C. Bank Okays Two Bank Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK) has approved two mergers in the banking industry, the Daily
Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The mergers involve Commerce and Giro banks on one hand, and
Guardian and First National on the other, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
"We received the request from them and have approved the
move," CBK's chief banking officer Reuben Marambii has confirmed
the mergers.
</P>
<P>
The mergers come in the wake of the placement of five banks
under statutory management by the CBK and ahead of the new
200-million-Shilling (3.36 million U.S. Dollars) capitalization
requirement for banks next year.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement by Giro Bank, their merger creates an
institution with an asset base of over four billion Shillings and
share-holder funds in excess of 340 million Shillings.
</P>
<P>
CBK governor Micah Cheserem has been urging small banks to
merge in order to meet the new capitalization requirement for
banks. The current level is 75 million Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Senior managers at the two banks said the application was made
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Menagers at the two banks said the banks share a chairman,
Chandu Gidumal, as well as a number of directors.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Bank started off as a hire purchase bank 15 years ago
while Giro has operated as a bank since its inception in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Giro Bank is expected to raise 134 million Shillings (2.2
million Dollars) while the rest will come from Commerce Bank.
Both banks have two branches each.
</P>
<P>
"The different backgrounds of the two banks are expected to
result in a compatible synergy," said a source close to the
banks.
</P>
<P>
The deceptive calm in the small banks sector was broken two
weeks ago with the closure of City Finance and Prudential banks
by CBK due to a persistent run by depositors.
</P>
<P>
In late September, the central bank also shut down Trust Bank,
the country's seventh largest bank as well as Reliance and
Bullion banks.
</P>
<P>
There are 55 banks in Kenya, 33 of which are classified as
small.
</P>
<P>
The CBK has said that 14 non-bank financial institutions and
26 of 55 commercial banks risk closure at the end of next year,
when a new banking rule requiring them to increase their capital
base becomes effective.
</P>
<P>
Small banks must raise nearly 3.9 billion Shillings (65
million Dollars) in the next 18 months, according to the

<HEADLINE> Philippines Escapes Recession in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy escaped
recession during the third quarter of this year, posing a
0.8-percent GNP growth as gains in service offset losses in
agriculture and industry, the government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
National Economic and Development Authority Director-General
Felip Medalla told reporters at a news conference that the
0.8-percent growth in the country's gross national product (GNP)
in the third quarter was up from a negative 0.3 percent growth in
the second quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
He was upbeat about the outlook, saying the Philippine economy
has bottomed out and is posed for recovery by the last quarter of
the year.
</P>
<P>
Another factor that pushed up the country's economy during the
third quarter was its foreign exchange receipts from abroad, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Had not the agricultural sector contracted further during the
period, he said, GNP growth could have been more substantial.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the projections made by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), Medalla said, the positive GNP growth has
proved the economy is better off than a further contraction
projected by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
During this period, the country's agriculture recorded its
worst growth in more than three decades due to the severe weather
condition that prevailed in the Philippines during the year.
</P>
<P>
In the industrial sector, Medalla said, weak demand and rising
production costs caused many establishments to close down and lay
off workers.
</P>
<P>
Among those that posted significant declines were
import-dependent sectors like industries of rubber products,
chemical products, petroleum and coal and metal.
</P>
<P>
Hit by the Asian financial contagion, the finance sector
composed of banks, insurance and other related institutions grew
by only 5.3 percent in the third quarter of the year against a
13.8-percent growth last year.
</P>
<P>
With the Philippine economy recovering during the third
quarter, Medalla said the government is expecting higher GNP
growth in the last quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, his agency is not optimistic that the country
will meet its GNP growth target of 1.5 percent for the whole year
since the economic growth for the fourth quarter will not be
enough to meet this yearend target.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Rebels Raid Prison, Grab 65 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 heavily armed gunmen
suspected to be rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) raided
a prison in Soroti district in eastern Uganda early Thursday
morning and abducted 65 inmates.
</P>
<P>
Among the abducted were 11 prisoners convicted for capital
offenses, Monitor daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels killed two and seriously injured three inmates
before carrying out the abductions, the report said.
</P>
<P>
David Wanyama, the deputy officer in charge of the prison,
said the incident occurred at around midnight. The gunmen
stormed the place from all corners, broke into cells after
overpowering prison warders and ordered inmates out at gun point.
</P>
<P>
The officer said the warders could not repulse the attackers
because the prison had only two guns for guarding at night.
</P>
<P>
The raiders were reportedly commanded by someone called Adotu
(one name) who was a former rebel of the defunct Uganda People's
Army and now purports to be LRA rebel.
</P>
<P>
Recently, there are reports that LRA rebels infiltrate into
Uganda and become active in some districts, sending a wave of
panic among local residents and rousing serious concerns among
the security authorities.

NAIROBI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will
sell 26 percent shares of its giant Kenya Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (KP&AMP;TC) when the body is
privatized.
</P>
<P>
Corporation Managing Director Jan Mutai made the remarks at
the extraordinary meeting of the African Advanced Level
Telecommunications Institute Governing Council which opened here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>

investors in the sector, according to Friday's East African
Standard.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that splitting of his company into three
independent entities will be carried out early next year upon the
completion of a number of formalities including opening balance
sheets and dividing assets.
</P>
<P>
Expensive and inappropriate technology are the main problem
stifling the growth of the telecommunication sector in Africa, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The managing director also called on African governments to
improve telecommunications access in the rural areas through the
use of modern technology such as wireless solutions and the

<HEADLINE> China Upgrading Battery Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- China plans to set up three
battery-related production bases by 2000 to manufacture
mercury-free zinc powder, mercury-free electrolytic manganese
dioxide and alkaline batteries.
</P>
<P>
Some of the technologies and key equipment are expected to be
introduced from abroad, according to sources at the China Battery
Industry Association, who also say this program is a major effort
on the part of this largest battery producer in the world to
upgrade the industry.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that China produced 13.1 billion battery
units last year, accounting for more than a third of the world's
total. Of these, about 60 percent were exported.
</P>
<P>
To meet increasing demands for high-quality and
environment-friendly products, China's battery industry launched a
massive campaign in 1995 to readjust its product mix and replace
traditional products with a series of new ones such as the
alkaline zinc manganese battery and lithium ionic battery.
</P>
<P>
A number of production lines for manufacturing these batteries
have already become operational in Shandong and Zhejiang provinces
and Shanghai, the country's leading industrial city.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is steadily pushing
forward changes in taxi fares, with all taxi meters would be
changed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Mr Zhou, a department director with the Beijing Taxi
Administration, said that Beijing has ordered that the meters of
its 66,500 taxis be changed at a rate of 1,000 taxis per day.
</P>
<P>
Since the new rates are generally lower than the old ones, taxi
drivers with changed meters fix a larger price stickers on their
windows to attract customers.
</P>
<P>
"When they and I meet a customer at the same time, the customer
definitely chooses them," complained Tong Jin, a driver of a red
Xiali who has not changed his meter yet.
</P>
<P>
Now, people in Beijing may take a taxi operating under the old
rates or the new.
</P>
<P>
The taxi meters of minibuses will not be changed as they will
be phased out in the city.

Wellington, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Merchandise imports in New

Zealand were up 12 percent in October 1998 to 2.35 billion NZ
dollars
(1.26 billion U.S. dollars) compared with October 1997, Statistics

New Zealand said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, Government Statistician Len Cook said the
latest figures included imports of large aircraft, as did the
figures
for October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Excluding these items, imports were up 5.3 percent or 104
million
NZ dollars (56.1 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Cook said a preliminary October 1998 export figure of 1.88
billion
NZ dollars suggested a trade deficit of about 470 million NZ
dollars
(253.7 million U.S. dollars) for the month.
</P>
<P>
When large irregular items were removed, the deficit was about
175
million NZ dollars (94.5 million U.S. dollars), he added.
</P>
<P>
The deficit for the year to October was 595 million NZ dollars

(321.3 million U.S. dollars) against 622 million NZ dollars (335.8

million U.S. dollars) for the previous year, according to Cook.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's log export to

Asia is improving, The Dominion reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted New Zealand Agriculture
and
Forestry Ministry advisor John Eyre as saying the country's log
exports to Japan and the Republic of Korea jumped 35 percent in
the
third quarter this year after a bad year.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that a recovery is under way," he said.
</P>
<P>
Eyre noted that the recovery is in volume rather than prices,
which were likely to stay relatively flat, but stable, during the
next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
"There have been inquiries from (South) Korea and Japan and
logs
are starting to flow back into those countries. It is the same in
lumber and panel products and ... pulp and paper orders have
started
to come back in.
</P>
<P>
"Pulp and paper is often one of the last to pick up after a
fall-
off in trade, so that indicator is very promising."
</P>
<P>
Eyre said he would not expect anyone to get too excited about
price rises over the next 12 to 18 months, but volumes are going
to
be good for cashflow.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Timber Industry Federation Executive Director Wayne

Coffey said that though there has been a good increase in Asian
log
trade between June and September, the figures were still low.
</P>
<P>
But he is of the view that all Asian economies are showing
signs
of recovery.

NANNING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic minority group
officials now account for 35 percent of the officials in the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in south China, 14 times the
number in 1958 when the region was established.
</P>
<P>
They are also playing a greater role in developing the local
economy. One example is Wei Junlin, a deputy secretary of the
Communist Party Committee of Guigang City, who helped people get
out of poverty in 1996 by planting sugarcane, and making Chongzuo
the first of the region's 49 impoverished counties to escape
poverty.

Xu Aili, a member of the Standing Committee of the Guangxi
Party Committee and head of the Publicity Department, said that
the region has had eight policies on training ethnic minority
officials in the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
Training courses and sending officials to universities,
polytechnic schools, and other schools have also been used to
improve the quality of ethnic minority officials, according to
Xu.
</P>

At present, 32 percent of the ethnic minority officials have
college diplomas, and 45 percent have polytechnic certificates.

NAIROBI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Bomb Disaster
Committee will wind up its work of paying survivors of the August
7 bomb blast by December 11, the committee's secretary David
Hutchinson has said.
</P>
<P>
The committee hopes to compensate about 3,200 victims by the
end of the exercise and will submit its final report to President
Daniel arap Moi on December 22, the East African Standard
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
So far, as many as 2,800 victims have been given compensations

the committee.
</P>
<P>
Hutchinson said at a fund-raising function on Wednesday night
that relatives of the dead will be paid 400,000 Shillings (One
U.S. Dollar equals roughly to 60 Shillings) for each victim.
</P>
<P>
"The very seriously injured will receive a maximum payment of
300,000 Shillings, reducing by stages according to seriousness of
injury," he said, adding that the minimum payment will be 30,000
Shillings.
</P>
<P>
At the function, U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Prudence Bushnell
said the U.S. administration will compensate the bomb victims
with about 2.2 million Shillings.

<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Evergreen lawns will be
planted in the world's largest square -- Tian'anmen Square in
China's capital Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The lawns, to be planted in two sections on the square's
western side, will be 160 meters long from north to south, and 30
meters wide from east to west, each covering a total of 4,800
square meters.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Parks and Woods
said that they will also use the evergreen lawns as part of next
spring's urban beautification project.
</P>
<P>
Gardening experts believe the type of grass will do well even
at 25 degrees Centigrade below zero, but they are likely to turn
yellow in the hot Beijing summer. So measures will be taken during
the hot months to lower the temperature in this area, allowing the
grass to remain green year round.

output value of 40 billion yuan last year, with exports hitting
500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
A local official said overseas investment has greatly promoted
the development of local animal husbandry, and that technology now
plays an important role in the production process in contrast to
conventional operating patterns.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 40 percent of the overseas capital has been
used to improve livestock breeds and production facilities, while
technological input has brought a 2-billion-yuan annual profit to
local farmers.
</P>
<P>
The industry structure has changed as well, with the focus
shifting from pig raising to chicken raising. The output value of
the chicken raising trade now accounts for over half of the total
animal husbandry sector, and the output of other animals has
increased as well.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of animal husbandry provides many job
opportunities for rural surplus laborers, and about four million
rural surplus laborers have found jobs in this sector so far this
year, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Trade Deficit Increases Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's trade deficit exploded
to more than 1.9 billion U.S. dollars or 24.8 percent of its total
export volume in the first 10 months of this year, exceeding the
state ceiling of 20 percent, the latest issue of Vietnam
Investment Review reported.
</P>
<P>
A shrinking international market and lower prices for imported
goods have caused Vietnam's trade deficit to mushroom, the
newspaper said, quoting official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said increasing difficulties in exports and
dropping prices of goods in the international market have worked
to push the trade deficit too high.
</P>
<P>
The prices have dropped considerably since 1996, especially for
goods that top Vietnam's import list.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Vietnam's imports of goods have increased. During
the first 10 months of this year, Vietnam imported over 5.5
million tons of oil and petrol, an extra million tons compared to
the same period of last year. Similarly, this year's imports of
iron and steel have risen by more than 400,000 tons and fertilizer
by 800,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The lower prices may not be the only reason for Vietnam's
skyrocketing import levels. According to some Vietnamese analysts,
many Vietnamese businesses are stockpiling materials in a bid to
avoid paying value added tax (VAT) which comes into effect in
1999.
</P>
<P>
The problem can be solved through better management of
unessential imports, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Overhead Light Rails Suggested to Reduce Urban Traffic Jams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Construction of more
overhead light rails would be an efficient way to reduce traffic
jams in urban areas, according to one Chinese railway expert.
</P>
<P>
Hong Jun, a professor at the China Railways Administrators
College, made this remark while attending a symposium in Xinzheng,
Henan Province, on the development of central China cities in the
economic belt along the Lianyungang-Lanzhou and Lanzhou-Urumqi
railway lines.
</P>
<P>
According to Hong, the average per-kilometer cost of light
rails is around 30 million yuan, only 5-10 percent that of subway.
</P>
<P>
Light rails have other attractive features such as speed and
efficient utilization of land area, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
Light rails are still something new in China, and to date there
are no completed light-rail lines. But in Shanghai, the country's
leading industrial and financial center, construction of a
24.9-kilometer-long overhead light rail is underway along with
the city's subway project.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, has
also started building a light rail system which will be 23.4
kilometers long when completed. This system will initially
transport 450,000 passengers daily, and eventually increase the
capacity to 1.2 million a day.
</P>
<P>
Some experts also suggest employing more flexible fund-raising
methods for light rail construction, including the use of overseas
investment.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Badminton to Appeal Sigit's One-Year Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) will file an appeal to the International
Badminton Federation (IBF) over a one-year suspension it has
imposed on doubles specialist Sigit Budiarto.
</P>
<P>
PBSI secretary-general Leo Chandra Wiranata said that chairman
Subagyo Hadi Siswoyo, who is also the Army Chief of Staff, made
the decision after a meeting with some of his staff on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Sigit has agreed to appeal, and Subagyo has ordered us to
complete the draft of our appeal as soon as possible," Leo said,
adding that Sigit's approval was compulsory to the appeal.
</P>
<P>
In its appeal, PBSI wants the IBF to halve the term of Sigit's
suspension, Leo was quoted by the Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The IBF punished Sigit for using nandrolone, an anabolic
steroid that is listed as a banned substance by the International
Olympic Committee, during the Singapore Open in August.
</P>
<P>
His suspension took effect on October 22, and will end on
November 15.
</P>
<P>
Leo said that even if the IBF refuses to cut the duration of
the suspension, the PBSI could ask the world badminton body to
begin the ban from the day Sigit failed the drug test in August,
because he has not competed since then.
</P>
<P>
He said that the appeal was intended to rescue Sigit's chance
of winning the gold medal at the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic qualifying rounds run from the first of May to the
end of April.
</P>
<P>
Sigit said in Bandung that he wanted to appeal for the sake of
his career, but declined further comments, saying that everything
is being handled by the PBSI.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Province Plans to Use More Taiwan Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Fujian Province in the eastern
coast plans to establish an economic cooperation zone to
strengthen ties with Taiwan across the Taiwan Straits, China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Fujian-Taiwan Cooperation Zone is expected to attract more
investment from Taiwan as Fujian enjoys geographic proximity
advantage and shares language and cultural background with Taiwan,
Vice-Governor of Fujian Cao Degan was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The blueprint of the zone was finished and is waiting for
the central government's approval, Cao added.
</P>
<P>
Economic links between Taiwan and Fujian have developed rapidly
over the past few years. Trade with Taiwan accounted for one-third
of the province's 19.5 billion U.S. dollars foreign trade volume
last year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October this year, the province had utilized 6.84
billion dollars of investment from Taiwan, 26.5 percent of
Fujian's total overseas investment, Cao said.
</P>
<P>
Fujian is the country's biggest recipient of direct foreign
investment, absorbing some 40 billion dollars each year. By the
end of October this year, overseas investors had pledged to put 54
billion dollars into 24,553 projects in the province, according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
The utilized overseas investment accounted for 40 percent of
Fujian's fixed investment and 60 percent of the province's export
last year, the vice-governor added.

<HEADLINE> Southwestern Chinese City Stops Silt Flow into Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The city of Chongqing on the
upper reaches of the Yangtze River is cutting the amount of silt
washing into the main stream of the river thanks to afforestation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The municipal forestry bureau says that the amount of annual
silt from the city is down 26 percent from the early 1980s and it
predicts that by 2009 when the dam downstream at the Three Gorges
is finished, soil erosion in the reservoir area and other nearby
areas will be within state limits.
</P>
<P>
Soil erosion if unchecked will affect shipping in the Three
Gorges reservoir in the future on the middle and lower reaches of
the Yangtze. Chongqing, in the 1980s, began two major
afforestation projects along both banks of the Yangtze and along
the Jialing River, a tributary. The Jialing used to be a major
source of silting in the Yangtze but has fallen 60 percent in mud
content and annual volume of silting.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has been included in a national forest protection
network and banned logging from September 1 this year. By 2010,
forest coverage in the city is expected to reach 46 percent, which
will put a brake on soil erosion.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Myanmar Strives to Promote Border Trade With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has opened a total of
12 border points with neighboring countries to promote its border
trade with them since the government took over the power of state
in late 1988.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has border trade with China, Thailand, India and
Bangladesh under bilateral agreements, carrying out trade
activities at six trade points with China, four with Thailand and
one each with India and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
China is one of Myanmar's major trading partners. The two
countries reached a border trade agreement in October 1988.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration of Bhamo (Lweje) border trade point of the
Myanmar side in August this year brought the number of such points
with China to six, and three of them are designated as
state-level ones.
</P>
<P>
According to Myanmar official statistics, bilateral trade
including border trade between Myanmar and China amounted to 331
million U.S. dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal year, rising from 242
million dollars the previous year, with the balance of trade in
China's favor.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar began border trade with Thailand, its another major
trading partner, in March 1996 at four border points. The addition
of the Thai-Myanmar Friendship Bridge on the Moei (Thaungyin)
River linking border towns of Myawaddy (Myanmar) and Maesot
(Thailand) in August 1997 has also facilitated bilateral border
trade.
</P>
<P>
The Thai trade authorities proposed in September this year to
establish a border trade coordinating agency of the two countries,
and suggested it meet three times a year.
</P>
<P>
The Thai side has asked Myanmar to lift its ban on exports of
such goods as gem stones, seafood and some livestock animals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Myanmar side is considering easing its
restrictions on the export of artificial flowers, seafood and
fresh-water fishery products except buffaloes or cows for fear of
shortages at home.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, bilateral trade including
border trade between Myanmar and Thailand stood at 330 million
dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal year, up from 289 million dollars in
1996-97. The balance of trade was in Thailand's favor.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's trade links with India also grew after the two
countries formally inaugurated border trade in April 1995. Since
then, bilateral trade at the border point of Tamu (Myanmar)-Moreh
(India) has grown markedly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, India has agreed with Myanmar in principle to open
two more border trade points, while undertaking to upgrade the
infrastructure facilities of Tamu-Kalemyo highway.
</P>
<P>
To promote trade with Myanmar, India held two trade exhibitions
in Yangon in 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade has registered significant growth in the past
four years with Myanmar's exports to India rising from 111.9
million dollars in 1993-94 to 236.63 million dollars in 1997-98,
according to Myanmar official Economic Indicators.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's imports from India increased from 46.89 million
dollars to 107 million dollars during the same period. Myanmar
enjoyed a large surplus in its trade with India.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Bangladesh signed an agreement on border trade in
May 1994, with the Maungtaw (Myanmar)-Teknaf (Bangladesh) trade
point formally opened in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade including border trade stands at about 8
million dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
To promote its trade with Myanmar, Bangladesh held two trade
fairs in Yangon in March 1995 and May 1996.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed between the two
countries' major trade organizations in July this year in Dhaka
envisages trade expansion and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the MOU, a Bangladesh-Myanmar business promotion center
will be set up in the private sector to explore the possibilities
of increased bilateral trade and economic cooperation,
particularly the possibility of setting up a special export
processing zone in the border town of Teknaf in southeast
Bangladesh, exclusively for joint ventures based on raw materials
from Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade and investment between the two countries is
expected to rise to 500 million dollars in two or three years.
</P>
<P>
In November 1997, Myanmar adjusted its border trade policy to
turn the trade into a normal one, using U.S. dollars as setting
accounts instead of the local currencies.
</P>
<P>
Starting February this year, Myanmar exempted the commercial
tax, which was previously levied at 5 percent, cut border trade
services charges to 8 percent from 10 percent and raised the rate
of income tax on imported goods from 1.5 percent to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's foreign trade, including border trade with
neighboring countries, in 1997-98 totaled 3.24 billion dollars.
The exports amounted to one billion dollars, running a trade
deficit of 1.24 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Textile Quota Bidding Completes On-line Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- China on-line bidding
mechanisms for government agencies saw another success yesterday
as electronic bidding for next year's textile quotas ended with
844 companies winning contracts in Beijing, "China Daily" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The tender was done through the China International Electronic
Commerce Network (CIECNet) by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The on-line bidding, for half of the total textile quotas in
1999, gathered 2,171 companies for tenders.
</P>
<P>
"The on-line application in the bidding sector shows that our
country's foreign trade is entering an electronic commerce
period," said Xing Wei, director of CIEC Center.
</P>
<P>
Tenders can dial up the network and search for any materials
concerning the bid at issue. Then, they can directly send their
bidding papers for tender through the network.
</P>
<P>
The CIECNet, the country's only special network in the foreign
trade sector, puts administration, information and service of
foreign trade and economic business together. It also provides a
showcase for business exchanges, creating a large information pool
for import and export companies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Wins "Creative Rural Women" Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Zuo Aimin never thought of
receiving a letter from Switzerland while busily working all day
in her duck shed in Feixi County, Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
But recently Zuo was overjoyed when told she had won the
"Creative Rural Woman" award by Elly Pradervand, executive
director and founder of the Women's World Summit Foundation based
in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"As a woman in the countryside, I've never dreamed of receiving
worldwide honors," she said.
</P>
<P>
Han Baojing in Shaanxi, Hu Chunlian in Hubei, and Zhao Xiaojing
in Hunan also shared this honor with Zuo Aimin.
</P>
<P>
The "Creative Rural Women" prize was first presented by the
Women's World Summit Foundation founded in 1993, an organization
supporting creative work beneficial to rural women and
children. The honor includes a prize of 500 U.S. dollars. The
awards are decided annually by the Foundation and the results are
announced around World Rural Women's Day on October 15.
</P>
<P>
The prize is awarded to those rural women who lead their
communities to prosperity with the help of modern technology, and
lift themselves out of poverty, according to Wu Qing, vice
president of the Foundation and a professor of American Studies
at Beijing Foreign Studies University.
</P>
<P>
Among the 64 candidates recommended by China's Women's
Association, only four are chosen. Zuo Aimin led 320 rural
families to riches by raising ducks, Han Baojing borrowed money to
dig wells for irritating her village, Zhao Xiaojing helped 30
villagers become pig-raising specialists, and Hu Chunlian brought
wastelands under cultivation and helped her village grow tea trees.
</P>
<P>
More and more Chinese rural men now choose to seek their
fortunes away from their villages in this time of rapid economic
developments. Wu said the situation now puts more responsibilities
on the shoulders of rural women, and they should be encouraged and
supported.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen Chinese women have won this award since the first two
received the honor at the Fourth World Conference on Women of the
United Nations in Beijing in 1995.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Fails to Change Production Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) failed to make any changes in its
current output policy during its ministerial meeting here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
OPEC Secretary General Rilwanu Lukman said the 11-member
organization decided to maintain its existing output quota at 26.5
million barrels a day (including 2.1 million barrels by Iraq)
despite record low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC ministers, meeting for one day following eight hours
of informal negotiations on the previous day, still could not
patch up their differences on new action to rescue the prices.
They said they would leave the issue to the next meeting in March
1999.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's biggest oil producer Saudi Arabia reportedly opposed
further output cuts and criticized other members for producing and
exporting more oil than their quotas.
</P>
<P>
An over-supply of oil on the world market forced OPEC to cut
its daily output by a total of 2.6 million barrels earlier this
year, but this proved to have little effect on boosting the
sagging price.
</P>
<P>
Average crude oil prices fell to a record low of 9.98
U.S. dollars a barrel on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait,
Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela. They account for some 37 percent of world oil
production.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Rejects Further Oil Output Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela is refusing to
commit to an extension of oil production cuts, sources from the
economic ministry said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the country was forced to reduce crude output
by only 400,000 barrels a day, instead of the 525,000 voluntarily
agreed with Saudi Arabia and Mexico to counter a price slump.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela could not keep its promise because it had no way to
satisfy domestic demand from different sectors strongly affected
by the output cut, the sources explained.
</P>
<P>
All the oil exporting countries have been affected by the drop
in prices, which explained Venezuela and Saudi Arabia's rejection
of more cuts within the present scheme of 2.6 million barrels a
day cut in force from July 1, 1997, until June 30 of next year,
said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The cut meant for Venezuela the dismissal of 8,000 workers from
March until Friday, as a consequence of reduced activity in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan contractors are slashing costs and investments, and
there is the risk of ceasing their activities if the contraction
in oil activities continues.
</P>
<P>
The economy of Venezuela, an OPEC member country, is 80 percent
dependent on oil exports.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela and other oil-producing countries are deeply
concerned about the serious problems facing the world's oil
industry with weak prices.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's average oil price has been cut nearly in half over the
past year because of a global oil glut.

<HEADLINE> More Oceanic Calamities Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- China will suffer form more
oceanic calamities in the next two decades if no immediate and
effective precautionary measures are taken, a marine environmental
official warned in an interview with China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Yu Zhouwen, director of the National Marine Environment
Forecasting Centre, said although oceanic calamities, including
storms, typhoons and red tides, are inevitable, their losses could
be significantly pruned through advanced forecasting and
precautionary reinforcement of dangerous sections of coastal
embankments.
</P>
<P>
Coastal provinces are China's most economically developed areas
and would be seriously affected if any oceanic calamity occurred,
Yu said, adding that the worsening oceanic environment makes this
more likely.
</P>
<P>
China, abundant in marine resources, has an 18,000-km-long
coastline, more than 6,500 islands and an oceanic area of 3
million square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The coastal provinces make up 13 percent of the country's total
area and feed 40 percent of China's 1.2 billion people. They also
contributed 60 percent of China's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
However, the importance of strengthening disaster precautions
and improving countermeasures is not given due attention,
according to Yu.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicated that on average more than 10
billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) has been lost to oceanic
calamities each year since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Qu Qiang, head of the inspecting and forecasting department
with State Oceanographic Administration, said that less than 3
million yuan (362,000 US dollars) was injected into
disaster-precaution measures and forecasting each year, far from
meeting the need.
</P>
<P>
Yu Zhouwen also underlined the importance of construction along
the coastal cities, organizing training and systematically
popularizing precautionary knowledge in the public for the purpose
of reducing disaster damages and easing relief work.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
needs to open 2.25 million hectares of farmland to raise food
production under the Movement for Self-Sufficiency in Rice,
Soybean and Corn by 2001, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
The Movement for Self-Sufficiency in Rice, Soybean and Corn
aims to produce 54.2 million tons of rice, 12 million tons of corn
and 2.2 million tons of soybean by 2001, Chairil Anwar Rasahan,
the Agriculture Ministry's director general for food crops and
horticulture, was quoted by Antara News Agency Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bureau of Statistics noted that with the present
size of Indonesia's agricultural land, the country could produce a
maximum of 46.3 million tons of rice, 9.1 million tons of corn and
1.4 million tons of soybean by 2001.
</P>
<P>
This year, Indonesia's domestic rice consumption is predicted
at 31 million tons, while the country's rice production could only
reach 28 million tons due to the poor harvests. To make up the
shortfall, the government plans to import up to 4.1 million tons
for the fiscal year ending March 1999.

<P>
CHENGDU, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Grain reform in southwest
China's Sichuan Province has produced positive results and
state-owned grain-enterprise losses have been effectively curbed.
</P>
<P>
To date, state-owned enterprises have purchased nearly three
billion kilos of grain, and in the latter half of this year they
were all selling grain at market prices.
</P>
<P>
Since June, losses suffered by Sichuan's state-owned
enterprises have been gradually decreasing and in seven
prefectures there have been no reports of new losses.
</P>
<P>
The local government attributes this achievement to improved
service by state-owned enterprises, the crackdown on illegal grain

<HEADLINE> Chinese Youth Choose New Wedding Ceremonies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Wang Jianfeng, who works for an
advertising company in Qingdao in eastern China's Shandong
Province, celebrated his wedding at a seaside resort two days ago.
</P>
<P>
"The reason we choose the beach to celebrate our wedding is
that we hope the special ceremony will bless our love forever."
explained Wang.
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese young people today prefer not to celebrate their
wedding ceremony by inviting friends and relatives to restaurants,
which is too common and dull in their eyes. The fast development
of the economy has created opportunities for the young to choose
romantic ways to get married.
</P>
<P>
Only 30 percent of young couples still celebrate their weddings
at restaurant, according to a survey conducted by the Beijing
Horizon Market Survey and Analysis Company.
</P>
<P>
New-style wedding ceremonies are popular these days. The beach
symbolizes that the tender love between the newly married couple
is just like the gentle sea, a church ceremony will impress the
couple with its solemnity and grandeur, and if they go mountain
climbing, the difficulty of the climb inspires husband and wife to
cherish their happy life.
</P>
<P>
Li Jianming, a sociologist with the Academy of Social Sciences
in Shandong Province noted that these changes reflect the
development of the local economy and shows that more and more
young people are changing their attitudes under the influence of
the reform and opening up policy.
</P>
<P>
Many wedding service companies are appearing throughout the
country which design wedding ceremonies, and though the cost of
their services is more than 1,000 yuan (120 U.S.dollars), they too
are gaining popularity these days.

Region after two decades of expansion.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the region has hosted a total of

ROME, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Italy intends to spearhead the
debate aimed at merging the Western European Union (WEU) with the
European Union (EU), Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The WEU, a liaison group between the EU and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, oversees Europe's security and defense issues.
</P>
<P>
"The Atlantic Alliance with the U.S. remains the fundamental
pillar of European security, while Italy's aim is to give Europe
the ability to act independently," Dini said in a report to the
Foreign and Defense Committee of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
He said Europe must be given the ability "to think
strategically, to carry out military planning and to run land
operation".
</P>
<P>
Although it was not possible to incorporate the merger of the
WEU with EU in the Amsterdam Treaty, Dini said the project and
method proposed remain valid.
</P>
<P>
The method was a three-step process by which the WEU and EU
would expand operatives activities, merge institutions and adopt
each other's treaties to foster reciprocal defense.
</P>

The WEU, established in 1955, consists of Belgium, Germany,
France, Holland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Britain and

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Calls For Creation of International Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican government
expressed its solidarity Thursday with Chile regarding the
judicial case of former Chilean President Augusto Pinochet. It has
called on the international community to create an international
penal court.
</P>
<P>
"There is a pressing necessity, in view of Chilean Senator
Augusto Pinochet's judicial case, for an international juridical
agency which will guarantee human rights protection and defense,"
said a communique signed by Costa Rican President Miguel Angel
Rodriguez and Foreign Minister Roberto Rojas.
</P>
<P>
This court "would prevent the painful diplomatic confrontations
between friendly countries -- which as in this particular case --
trying to reclaim their own right to apply their internal
juridical mechanisms," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The British House of Lords rejected Wednesday the immunity
allegations of Pinochet, who is being detained in London while
awaiting the British government's decision about the extradition
request made by Spain.
</P>
<P>
During Pinochet's rule from 1973-1990, over 2,000 were killed
for political reasons and another 1,000 disappeared after their
arrests, including some Spaniards.
</P>
<P>
"Chile, a nation which has fought with effort and dedication
for a democratic process, is now at the crossroads of having to
reclaim the sovereignty of territoriality in the application of
the law to its citizens," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
"The Costa Rican government renews in this difficult time its
solidarity with the Chilean people and government, a country with
which we are united by strong ties of closeness and affect," it
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Tomba to be Tried for Tax Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Former skiing idol Alberto Tomba
was ordered by a Bologna judge on Thursday to be tried for tax
fraud, ANSA news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Tomba, one of Italy's greatest sporting heroes, will go
through the trial to be started on March 29, 2000, together with
other six people involved, including his father while his mother
has been cleared of the charge.
</P>
<P>
Investigating magistrate Leonardo Grassi said Tomba is accused
of failing to enter some 23 billion lire (14 million US dollars)
on his tax returns from 1990 to 1996 and using a complex web of
international transfers to hide his earnings.
</P>
<P>
Tomba and the sponsors are both alleged to have set up shell
companies in foreign tax havens, enabling funds to be transferred
from one side to the other without any money appearing in Italian
bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
Tomba risks up to five years in jail if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Tomba's lawyer Marco Zanotti argued that Tomba should be
acquitted because he had signed over all his financial affairs to
his father and was therefore not responible for their management
and the charge should be of tax evasion, rather than tax fraud,
which carries a maximum of two years in jail instead of five.
</P>
<P>
Aside from Tomba's father, the charges have also been made
against three of the former skier's business associates.

<HEADLINE> Second Loan for Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Andean Development
Corporation (CAF) granted a second loan of 80 million U.S. dollars
for the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline, the local press reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The contract was signed by the CAF'S executive president
Enrique Garcia and Transportadora Brasilena Gasoducto Bolivia
Brasil (TBG) Director Cesar Diaz Ramos in Washington.
</P>
<P>
It's said that besides the TGB, a joint enterprise that will
implement the plan, credit was also granted to Petroleos
Brasilenos (Petrobras) and other multinational firms.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the CAF approved 215 million U.S.dollars on building
the 3,061 kilometer gas pipeline, which will go from the Bolivian
city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra to Porto Alegre, a city in the
southeast of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The CAF resources will partially finance the building of the
pipeline on the Brazilian side, the executive president of CAF
said.
</P>
<P>
Three months ago Petrobras received 85 million U.S.dollars to
finance the Bolivian side of the line.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the connection between Santa Cruz and San
Paulo could be inaugurated next year.

<HEADLINE> Many Senior Officers Involved in Indonesia's May Riots, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Many high-ranking officers
were allegedly involved in May riots and the abduction of
anti-government activists in Indonesia, according to the father of
dismissed former chief of the special elite forces Kopassus Lt.
Gen. (ret) Prabowo Subianto.
</P>
<P>
"I feel there is no justice for Prabowo because the people have
focused their condemnation against Kopassus and Prabowo," noted
Economist Soemitro Djojohadikusumo told reporters here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo, the son-in-law of former president Soeharto, led
Kopassus for three years until March when he was promoted to lead
the Army's elite Strategic Reserves Command (Kostrad). He was
discharged from the Army in August after a military investigation
found that some Kopassus units were involved in the abduction of
critics of Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Soemitro said Prabowo was definitely not the sole instigator of
the wave of kidnappings that took place during April 1997-May
1998. Neither was Prabowo the only military official involved in
the May 13-15 riots which left more than 1,200 people dead and
thousands of buildings destroyed or looted.
</P>
<P>
He does not deny the charges. But he said the public should
realize that Prabowo was only following orders from his commanders
in the military.
</P>
<P>
"We know there were other units, and there were other military
officers involved," Soemitro was quoted by national newspapers
Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Soemitro appealed to the public to be fair to his son. He said
his son was an officer willing to take responsibility for his
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
"But what about his superiors, the Army Chief of Staff and the
Armed Forces' Chief of General Staff. There is a (military) saying
that the two immediate superiors should know about any violations
committed by an officer. So you know the answer yourselves," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Soemitro declined to disclose the whereabouts of Prabowo.
Businessman Hasjim Djojohadikusumo, Prabowo's brother, said last
month that he was in Europe for medical treatment.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Minority Areas Modernize with Help of New Construction (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Ten years ago, Dahua Yao
Autonomous County could not be found on the map of the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Today, department stores, law courts, television stations,
night clubs and other modern facilities dot the
barren-slope-turned new county seat.
</P>
<P>
The birth of the new Yao ethnic group town is a result of the
influx of workers and settlers due to the construction of two
central-government financed hydropower stations.
</P>
<P>
"We have requisitioned compensation for our farmland. What's
more important, my grandchildren will no longer have to work
behind the plough animals," said Lan Zhongfu, a 77-year-old farmer.
</P>
<P>
According to a central government decision, 25 percent of the
income of the power stations go into the county's coffer. Now,
this money accounts for 85 percent of the county's revenue.
</P>
<P>
"If not for the power stations, we would still be the poorest
county in Guangxi," said Tan Xianchao, the county's Communist
Party chief.
</P>
<P>
The power stations also turned many local farmers into workers
and generated a need for the construction of high-quality highways.
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to make money here," said Wei Yingkui, a farmer of
the Zhuang ethnic group who moved to Dahua from another county to
sell fish and marry a local girl.
</P>
<P>
The Tianshengqiao Hydropower Station is another source of
wealth for Guangxi's Longlin Autonomous County located at the
Guangxi-Guizhou border.
</P>
<P>
Because of the unique and beautiful scenery around the power
station, Longlin County has decided to build a folklore tourist
center there.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi in south China has some of the richest water, mineral
and biological resources in the country, mainly in its
northwestern region where the ethnic minority population is
concentrated.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Minority Areas Modernize with Help of New Construction (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The region received little central government financing in the
past, and minority areas were too poor to fund any large
construction by themselves.
</P>
<P>
This situation has changed since the central authorities put
in place a development plan which stresses the construction in the
central and western regions of China.
</P>
<P>
According to this plan, on Guangxi's Hongshui River alone, ten
power facilities will be built, including the Longtan Power
Station which will become the second largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year-Plan period (1991-95), the central
government invested 55.5 billion yuan (about 6.7 billion
U.S. dollars) in 30 key projects in Guangxi, surpassing the total
in all the previous five-year-plan periods.
</P>
<P>
A similar construction boom has also emerged in the autonomous
regions of Tibet, Ningxia, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The central government's goal is both economic and political.
</P>
<P>
"Our highest political aim is to surpass the developed areas of
the majority Han nationality both economically and culturally,"
claimed Lan Huaxing, the head of Dahua County.
</P>
<P>
The newly built railway trunk linking Nanning, Guangxi's
capital, with Kunming, capital of neighboring Yunnan Province, is
known as the country's leading poverty-relief project for ethnic
minority areas.
</P>
<P>
Along the railroad flanked by golden rice fields, aluminium
plants have sprung up along with vegetable fairs and new villages,
and locally produced goods are sold as far away as northeast China.
</P>
<P>
"The train can take me to other provinces to look for a job,"
said Lan Zhizhang, a resettler from a rocky mountain areas.
</P>
<P>
"I saw Li Peng, the former premier, when he cut a ribbon for
the completion of the railway," he said. "I felt Li Peng looked
exactly the same as on television," he added.
</P>
<P>
Effectively handling the relationship between the exploitation
of the local resources and protection of local interests is the
concern of Zhao Jing, a Guangxi ethnic-issues scholar.
</P>
<P>
For example, construction of reservoirs can submerge large
tracts of farmland and villages and trigger the need for
resettlement. This has been one focus of his studies.
</P>
<P>
"The long-standing problem under the planned economy of paying
too much attention to construction while neglecting the issue of
resettlement is now being redressed," said Lan Huaxing.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the central government will work out more legislation
for the protection of the interests of the ethnic minority areas,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Sets New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras made history on
Thursday as he became the first man to stay as the world number
one for six years in a row after beating Slovakian Karol Kucera
at the ATP Tour world championship in Hanover, Germany, on Thursda
y.
</P>
<P>
Chilean world number two Marcelo Rios, Sampras' only rival in
the race for number one, had earlier withdrawn injured from the
season's finale, making the American certain to write his name in
the record book.
</P>
<P>
As if to underline his domination, Sampras, who had already
made sure of a berth in the semifinals, taught world number seven
Kucera a tennis lesson on his way to a spectacular 6-2, 6-1 win.
</P>
<P>
Tim Henman became the first British player to secure a place
in the semifinals of the year-ending event by taming Spaniard
Alex Corretja in three sets 7-6, 6-7, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Rios, a mere 33 points behind Sampras at the start of the
week, needed a better result than the American in the tournament
to finish 1998 in front.
</P>
<P>
Rios left his place to Spain's Albert Costa, who lost to
Briton Greg Rusedski in the battle of alternates.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski, who stepped in after American Andre Agassi retired
with a back injury on Wednesday, wasted nine set points before
taking the first set in a tie break. He then relied on his heavy
artillery to cruise to a 7-6, 6-1 win over the Spaniard, who has
never won an indoor match in his professional career.

<HEADLINE> Adams' Career at Crossroads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League Club
Arsenal are steeling themselves for another major blow with fears
that Tony Adams' career is at the crossroads again.
</P>
<P>
Highbury medical staff have ruled out surgery for the England
center-half, 32, who came off at half-time during the 1-0
Champions' League defeat by Lens in agony because of his
long-term back complaint.
</P>
<P>
The favored option is a return to the fitness clinic in
southern France where Adams was sent by manager Arsene Wenger last
 year for 'make-or-break' treatment of the joints in his lower
back. Last December the treatment program lasted just over a week
but the Highbury captain was not ready to return to the Arsenal
side until late January and this time, if the plan goes ahead, it
could be even longer.
</P>
<P>
Adams, who was also battling an ankle injury a year ago,
admitted then that he had seriously considered ending his playing
career and, earlier this season, he spoke of his fears about
long-term stomach damage if he kept taking anti-inflammatory
tablets to deal with back pain.
</P>
<P>
He has been trying to get through this campaign without the
tablets - and been rested altogether from some matches by Wenger
- but now the problem has come to crisis-point again.
</P>
<P>
Adams' problem is yet another daunting problem for Wenger as
he bids to ride out the storm following Arsenal's exit from
Europe.
</P>
<P>
His one feasible transfer target at the moment is 22-year-old
Nigerian World Cup striker Nwankwo Kanu.
</P>
<P>
But Wenger wants the four million pound rated former Ajax
star, who recovered from heart surgery two years ago to rebuild
his career with Inter Milan, on loan until the end of season
before he commits himself to a permanent deal.
</P>
<P>
The Arsenal boss faces a testing run-in to Christmas, without a
dequate replacements for Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Vieira and
Emmanuel Petit - sorely missed at Wembley.
</P>
<P>
And with Adams again adding to his injury worries, Wenger will
need to produce another midwinter miracle, similar to last
season's revival after four chilling defeats in six League games
sent them sliding down the League table. But by the time Adams
returned in late January, Arsenal's amazing recovery was already
underway and what they achieved is now glorious history. Wenger
said: "We overcame huge adversity last year and we can do it
again."

<HEADLINE> Football Hooligans Face New Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The football authorities are
taking further steps to prevent English hooliganism abroad.
</P>
<P>
Fans traveling with the national team are to be vetted more
strictly before being given tickets.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association said 35,000 members of the official
England supporters club will be checked for all convictions for
violence or public order offenses committed anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
Only people with football-related convictions were previously
banned from joining the official club.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown follows the FA receiving a fine for fan trouble
in Sweden last September, and a warning from police that
hooliganism is on the increase again.
</P>
<P>
The extra checks will come into effect during the next month
as existing club members renew their applications for the next
two years.
</P>
<P>
FA security consultant Sir Brian Hayes said: "We want to do
everything we can to ensure that this minority cannot masquerade
as decent fans under the banner of the England Members' Club."
</P>
<P>
The club is the only official way of getting tickets for away
matches and gives members priority for home games.
</P>
<P>
Sir Brian admitted that the FA was still relying on the
honesty of applicants, since they have no legal right to
investigate whether they are telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that "in selected cases, where we think it's
desirable" applicants may have to get a certificate from the
police to back up their claims.
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes on the eve of the government unveiling
their own package of new measures.
</P>
<P>
These are expected to go further, with powers to ban
unconvicted hooligans from traveling to matches abroad simply on
the word of a senior police officer.
</P>
<P>
Kate Hoey, Home Office minister responsible for football
legislation, said: "It is important that everyone in football
works together and plays their part in removing hooliganism from
the game."

<HEADLINE> Villa Starlet Offered Five-year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Premiership leaders Aston
Villa have rewarded teenage defender Gareth Barry for his
impressive performances this season by offering him a new
five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old has won a regular place in the Villa side and
made his debut for the England under-21 side in last week's game
against the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Villa manager John Gregory has admitted he thought Barry was
"rubbish" after watching him for the first time in a reserve
match nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
But he was given his chance when David Unsworth left for
Everton and the new deal will provide Barry with a basic 2,500
pounds a week salary, plus a further 7,500 pounds for every game
he plays.
</P>
<P>
"All things being equal, Gareth is guaranteed a massive future
in the game. I have seen some kids put on a pedestal at 17 and by
19 they have disappeared off the face of the earth," said Gregory.
</P>
<P>
"But he is different in being more of a down to earth kid, is
a quick learner and his progress this season has been tremendous,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
Talks about the contract are ongoing, but Barry hopes to put
pen to paper before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
"Things have gone great so far, but it is still all a learning
process for me and I am not getting carried away," he said.
</P>
<P>
Villa have, meanwhile, named striker Stan Collymore as their
new penalty-taker after missing four of the six spot-kicks
awarded to them this season.
</P>
<P>
They have tried four different penalty takers but Collymore
has been given the job after finding the net with his only
previous effort in the UEFA Cup tie against Celta Vigo.

BONN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer stressed here Thursday that an expansion of relations with
Russia would be an important item on the agenda during Germany's
presidency of the European Union (E.U.) beginning on January 1,
1999.
</P>
<P>
But it was essential that Russia do its utmost to recover, with
a consolidation of the national budget and a reform of the banking
system being of special importance, Fischer told Gennady Zyuganov,
the chairman of Russia's Communist Party, who is beginning his
two-day visit to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov said he expected that the elections planned for June
2000 would be held earlier and that the Communist Party would do
very well.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov urged the German government to support Russia's wish
for integration in Europe and in the European institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Russian politician also met Thursday with German Finance
Minister Oskar Lafontaine and the leaders of the various
parliamentary factions in the Bundestag, the lower house of
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Britain Releases Two Imprisoned Catholic Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Thursday set free
two Catholic militants who had been imprisoned for killing two
soldiers in Northern Ireland 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The two prisoners, Alexander Murphy and Henry Maguire, who were
sentenced life imprisonment, were released under the Northern
Ireland peace agreement which is aimed at ending 30-year-long
conflict in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The presiding trial judge said Murphy had pointed out the
defenceless soldiers to an IRA gunman who shot them and Maguire
had grappled with one of the victims to prevent his escape.
</P>
<P>
The judge described the murders as "particularly savage and
vicious". The pair were also convicted of possessing a gun and
false imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement that was struck in April, all prisoners
involved in the Northern Ireland conflict will be set free within
two years. More than 200 prisoners linked to IRA and Loyalist
groups have already been given early release since September and
200 more others will walk out of the Maze prison next year.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Boosted By Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets moved
gently higher Thursday, boosted by reports of merger talks between
giants Exxon and Mobil.
</P>
<P>
London leading shares shrugged off a gloomy CBI survey and the
FTSE 100 climbed 72.6 points to close at 5827.9.
</P>
<P>
Hopes of further monetary easing were boosted by the CBI's
forecast of a 1.25 percentage point cut by mid-1999 to 5.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
This helped offset a dismal industrial trends survey, which
said a manufacturing recession was "increasingly likely", and a
cut in the CBI's growth forecast for 1999, to 0.7 percent from 1.2
percent in August.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt market was boosted by Siemens shares amid the
company's restructuring. The Dax closed 107.26 points higher at
5051.63.
</P>
<P>
Traders said merger news also buoyed sentiment as shares
reacted positively to a report Exxon is in talks to buy rival
Mobil.
</P>
<P>
Siemens is merging its Munich-based subsidiarly Osram into its
semiconductors business to form a joint venture for optoelectronic
semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
Paris market added to recent gains, driven higher by a rally in
oil shares on the back of the Exxon_Mobil tie-up report and the
CAC 40 index closed 65.69 points higher at 3915.53.

<HEADLINE> UK Takes Action over Worsening Rail Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- British Deputy Prime Minister
John Prescott on Thursday outlined a new package to tackle the
problems of the country's failing railways.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with rail company chiefs, Prescott said new
trains with new drivers will be put into the rail service to
improve the efficiency of the rail transportation.
</P>
<P>
Passenger complaints about punctuality, overcrowding and
reliability have gone up since privatization
</P>
<P>
Following Thursday's meeting, attended by Railtrack, the Office
of Passenger Rail Franchising and representatives of 25 rail
companies, Prescott announced 800 new train drivers are to be
recruited in the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 500 new vehicles - made up of about 370 new
carriages and around 170 new power units - will be introduced over
the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The immediate package will also see train operators and train
leasing companies and suppliers setting up taskforces to deliver
better rolling stock reliability.
</P>
<P>
Railtrack and its contractors are also being pressed to improve
track maintenance to ensure fewer delays. The train companies and
Railtrack will form a "joint hit squad" to identify and tackle the
worst 50 bottlenecks on the system.
</P>
<P>
There will be a national troubleshooter team to tackle problems
across the network and a passenger survey to give a clear picture
of performance will be introduced
</P>
<P>
Prescott said the meeting had been constructive and he had made
it very clear that the current state of problems on the railways
was "just not acceptable".
</P>
<P>
He said: "Rail passengers have a right to expect a railway
which is reliable, safe and fairly priced. I am pleased that the
industry has recognized that it needs to live up to its
responsibilities."
