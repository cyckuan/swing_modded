<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Economy Satisfactory in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' economic performance was
satisfactory in 1998 with a high growth rate and declining
unemployment, said a survey released Thursday by Cyprus' Central
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate rose to 5.0
percent in 1998 compared to 2.5 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The pick-up in economic activity has put a halt to the rising
unemployment observed in the previous two years, as unemployment
fell to 3.3 percent in 1998, from 3.4 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Economic prospect for the 1999 fiscal year is promising with
the GDP growth rate envisaged at about 4.0 percent and the jobless
rate expected to decline to about 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Deficit on the current account is also expected to move for the
better this year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, the main pillar of Cyprus' economy, seems encouraging
with arrivals expected to grow by about 7.1 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Export is also expected to recover in 1999, while inflation is
expected to remain at around 2.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey warned that as the fiscal deficit has been
rising since 1996, economic stability could be damaged if this
imbalance is not addressed soon.

<HEADLINE> Germany Supports Turkey's Bid for EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer Thursday reaffirmed his country's support to Turkey's bid
for European Union (EU) membership.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who arrived in Ankara Wednesday evening for a two-day
official visit, said at a meeting with Turkish human rights
activists that "We support Turkey's full EU membership and we will
extend efforts to overcome the existing obstructions."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the accusation that the union is keeping Turkey, a
Muslim-populated but politically secular state, at arm's length
because it wants to remain a "Christian club," Fischer said "The
EU is not a religious group. It is a group based on common values."
</P>
<P>
"Human rights is the most important among these common values,"
the German official said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer's visit is the first by a senior German official to
Turkey since 1997, when Turkey was excluded from the list of full
membership candidates at the EU summit in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Ankara strongly accused then German Chancellor Helmut Kohl of
blocking Turkey's EU entry.
</P>
<P>
However, incumbent German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and
Fischer have been openly pro-Turkish since the days when their
parties were in opposition.
</P>
<P>
Germany attempted to secure an official announcement of
Turkey's candidacy at the EU summit in Cologne last June, but
failed due to objections from Greece, Italy and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
In remarks to reporters at a reception held in the German
Embassy in Ankara, Fischer said the fate of Abdullah Ocalan,
captive leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), will
have a considerable impact on the EU's stance towards Turkey at
its upcoming summit in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
On June 29, Turkey's Ankara State Security Court gave a death
sentence to Ocalan on charges of treason and separatism.
</P>
<P>
All EU countries are opposed to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that Turkey has not carried out any death penalty
since 1984 is really significant. This is a very good tradition
and I hope it will continue," Fischer stressed.
</P>
<P>
Turkish sources said Turkish officials demanded that the German
government take measures against supporters and affiliates of the
Ocalan-led PKK.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that over 10,000 PKK supporters are active in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a separatist war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, which has claimed over
37,000 lives in the conflicts between the Turkish security forces
and the PKK militants since 1984.

<HEADLINE> NATO Signs Contract With French, U.S. Defense Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- NATO signed on Thursday a contract
with the French defense industrial group Thomson CSF and U.S.
defense industrial group Raytheon on building a new air defense
system, said the two groups in a joint communique.
</P>
<P>
The cost for the primary phase of building this system, which
is aimed at offering NATO member countries a complete
inter-operativeness in air defense, is estimated at 500 million
U.S. dollars and is expected to be completed in six years.
</P>
<P>
Raytheon, the world's second largest electronic defense group,
and Thomson CSF, the world's third largest in the field, set up a
joint venture in 1996 for producing air defense armaments.
</P>
<P>
The new air defense system, which will replace NATO's old air
defense commanding and controlling system it has been using since
1966, consists of equipment for planning air missions, for
controlling military air traffic, and control of command centers.
</P>
<P>
With the new system, NATO will equip its European member
countries with extra air offensive and defensive capacities.
</P>
<P>
NATO launched the project of renewing its air defense system in
1996 to adapt itself to the new security environment after the
fall of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic alliance has also decided to increase
decentralized air defense capacities in Europe after the recent
war against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Urges More attention to AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said in west Kenya Thursday that Kenyans must appreciate the
gravity of the situation and start talking openly and forcefully
about the problem.
</P>
<P>
"Although indications show that 95 percent of Kenyans are aware
of the problem as well as the mode of transmission of the disease,
people tend to ignore the seriousness of the problem," said Moi.
</P>
<P>
The president said that instead of talking vaguely about people
dying of chronic or acute illnesses, Kenyans should be bold enough
to let those concerned know that they have lost a dear one through
this dreaded disease.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that both young and old people must be made aware
that AIDS results from failure to observe basic morals and
necessary precautions.
</P>
<P>
"An effective solution to the AIDS problem does not lie with
better drugs, but with responsible behavior," Moi said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are 750,000 people suffering from
AIDS and some 1.9 million, among the total population of 30
million, are HIV positive in the east African country.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
seeking to reach the 2.3 billion U.S. dollars required for
inter-agency humanitarian response to the needs of about 26
million persons at risk around the world.
</P>
<P>
To date, donors have provided about 30 percent of the funds
sought during the global launch of the Consolidated Appeals last
December in Geneva, of which almost half was in response to the
recent crisis in the Balkans, a U.N. release said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This trend clearly threatens the continuity of vital relief
aid programs around the world," the news release said.
</P>
<P>
Today, the United Nations system and its partners are
presenting their revised appeals to provide life-saving assistance
to people in Afghanistan, Angola, the Great Lakes region,
Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, two new consolidated appeals are being launched to

</P>
<P>
"The revised requirements for emergency and rehabilitation
assistance programs for Kosovo will be presented to the donor
community as part of the revised Consolidated Appeal for
Southeastern Europe next week," the news release said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mitchell Optimistic, Adams Downbeat about N.Irish Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. mediator George Mitchell,
invited back to Northern Ireland to save its peace agreement, said
on Thursday the pact could be salvaged but warned it might take a
long time.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell announced that his review of the agreement would
formally start on September 6, according to a Reuters report filed
from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the Irish Republican Army issued a statement which
pro-British Unionists denounced as a veiled threat to resume
violence, the former U.S. senator said the British province had to
follow the path of democracy.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams was much more pessimistic
after meeting British Prime Minister Tony Blair in London,
according to a Reuters report filed from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Irish Republican Army's political wing said
the peace process was in real trouble and he accused pro-British
Protestant Unionists of "tearing to shreds" last year's Good
Friday peace agreement."
</P>
<P>
The IRA had angrily blamed Britain for the political crisis in
a statement, saying the agreement, designed to end three decades
of sectarian and political violence, had failed to deliver
progress and was now less likely to do so.
</P>
<P>
But British security sources said there was nothing in the
statement to suggest the guerrillas planned to end their
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said the IRA
statement was unhelpful. "I think it is unhelpful because it shows
the degree of mistrust that exists and probably fuels that
mistrust," she said.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, leader of Northern Ireland's main Protestant
group the the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) said aspects of the IRA
statement were "offensive."
</P>
<P>
Mitchell sought to calm the atmosphere. "The conflict lasted a
long time. Establishing a durable peace and achieving genuine
reconciliation will also take a long time and I think it is going
to take patience, determination and perseverance by all
concerned," he said. "I believe it can be done and I am
determined to do all I can to see it through."
</P>
<P>
The IRA gave no direct response to demands by politicians in
Britain and Ireland that it disarm to help the peace process,
which is deadlocked because politicians from the Protestant
majority refuse to sit in a power-sharing provincial government
with Sinn Fein until the guerrillas disarm.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) announced Thursday the approval of 95.9 million U.S.
dollars in financing for a private sector concessionaire in Brazil
for construction, rehabilitation, upgrading, operation and
maintenance on a toll road system that links the cities of Sao
Paulo, Jundiai, Campinas and Limeira.
</P>
<P>
The project, whose total cost is 514.3 million dollars, is an
essential contribution to the roadway rehabilitation and upgrading
plan of Sao Paulo State, the Washington-based IDB said.
</P>
<P>
The project is to build a 76.7 kilometer extension of the
Bandeirantes highway from Campinas to Limeira with three lanes in
each direction in the stretch between Campinas and Americana (36.7
km) and two lanes in either direction for the segment between
Americana and Limeira (40 km).
</P>
<P>
Other investments for the 20-year concession include building
of three additional toll plazas and the modernization of the
existing five toll plazas, establishment of an operational control
center and modernization of traffic control, new intersections and
road segments where needed, road rehabilitation, and construction
of several weight stations.
</P>
<P>
The IDB financing consists of a loan of 50 million dollars from
ordinary capital and a syndicated loan of 45.9 million dollars,
with funds provided by commercial banks under subscription of
participation agreements with IDB.
</P>
<P>
Project funding will be completed with additional debt
financing from the International Finance Corporation and the Banco
Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social, in addition to
equity contributions from private investors, the IDB said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Leans Neither to West nor to  East: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's foreign policy will make
it lean neither to the West nor to the East with Nigeria itself
and not Africa as its center-piece, Foreign Minister Alhaji Sule
Lamido said.
</P>
<P>
In a chat with reporters in capital Abuja Wednesday, the
minister gave an insight into the foreign policy of the President
Olusegun Obasanjo government, the Daily Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that days when Nigeria looked toward the
East or the West were gone.
</P>
<P>
Under the new foreign policy, Lamido pointed out, Nigeria will
no longer play the role of Father Christmas in its relations with
other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Although Nigeria would still reach out to other
countries in need, this time it would prefer to touch the lives of
the people in would-be beneficiary countries rather than give
money directly to the governments.
</P>
<P>
"Our assistance must be seen to touch the lives of the people
of other countries through Nigeria helping such countries fund
road construction or provide potable water to their peoples," the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo said on Monday in Luanda, Angola where he
paid one- day official visit, that Nigeria would revive all
dormant agreements signed with other African countries with a view
to creating closer economic ties among African countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Angola and Nigeria had had a long history of
cooperation and the two nations were now poised to revitalize that
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the two nations would cooperate not
only in the oil and gas sectors, but also in the agricultural and
solid minerals sectors.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that the renewed cooperation, which had
been dormant over the past two decades, could result in increased
trade and other economic cooperation ventures between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Obsanjo disclosed that the long dormant Nigeria/Angola joint
commission was being reactivated, adding that a meeting of the
body would be held in Abuja before the end of the year.

</P>
<P>
After the meeting in London, Cook told a news conference that
he would visit Moscow in the near future to continue the

</P>
<P>
Ivanov's visit "has given us in Britain the opportunity to

that in particular there are good relations between both in the
military sphere."

<HEADLINE> EU Puts Some 204 Million U.S. Dollars to Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
earmarked a further 196 million euro (203.84 million U.S. dollars)
in humanitarian aid for Kosovo, a Yugoslav province, as the return
of refugees and displaced persons continues, a EU news release
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This new appropriation, which will be managed by the European
Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), brings total assistance for
the Kosovo crisis this year to 378 million euro (393.12 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 146 million euro (151.84 million U.S. dollars) is
immediately available for humanitarian actions, while the balance
of 50 million (52 million U.S. dollars) will be kept in a
contingency reserve to allow ECHO to reinforce its assistance as
necessary.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 650,000 people have returned to Kosovo, and
many have found their homes and belongings destroyed or looted.
The challenge for the humanitarian community now is to provide
adequate winter shelter before colder weather sets in from
September.
</P>
<P>
ECHO's partners, the United Nations agencies, the Red Cross
Movement and non-governmental organizations will work on continued
implementation of the Kosovo Return Plan, which has been drawn up
jointly by ECHO and the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), said the news release.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes the distribution of building material and
basic commodities, such as beds, mattresses, blankets and stoves,
and enables returnees to start minor repairs to make their homes
weather-proof before the arrival of winter.
</P>
<P>
The new funding includes 30 million euro (31.2 million U.S.
dollars), a major contribution to UNHCR, which brings ECHO's
contribution to UNHCR's work in Kosovo to 63.3 million euro
(65.832 million U.S. dollars) this year alone, the news release
said.

LOME, Togo, July 22 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
arrived here Thursday afternoon for a 24-hour working visit at the
invitation of Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema.
</P>
<P>
Chirac was received at the airport by Eyadema and an
exceptional reception of 21-cannon salute, although the French
president is on a working visit.
</P>
<P>
He has just ended a two-day visit in Guinea and will leave here
on Friday to visit Nigeria and Cameroun, two other stops in his
fourth visit to the black continent since he became president in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Eyadema are due to hold their first meeting Thursday
evening at the Palace of Congress here.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents are expected to discuss bilateral economic
cooperation and the way to end the 10-year crisis between the
Togolese government and the country's oppositions.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has suspended its economic aid programs to
Togo since 1993, because of what Brussels judged "insufficient
progress in the field of democracy" in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will also meet with the representatives of the
oppositions of Togo to seek a relaxing of the tension between them
and the government.
</P>
<P>
Before flying to Lome, Chirac inaugurated with Guinean
President Lansana Conte a dam on the Konkoure River in Guinea,
which was built with French financial aid.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Offices Raided by EU Antitrust Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) confirmed on
Thursday that its investigators had raided Coca-Cola company's
offices in four European countries over past two days to seize
documents related to anti-competition practices.
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner for competition Karel Van Miert said he
ordered the raids on the offices of American drinking corporation
in Britain, Germany, Austria and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
"A dominant company on any market cannot indirectly bully
competitors by pushing its customers to buy less of the
competitors's products," he said.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, EU's executive body, also said in a
statement that Coca-Cola was "suspected of practices which would
not be in line with European Community law."
</P>
<P>
Under the EU rules, companies found violation of regulations on
fair business competition can face fines of up to 10 percent of
their revenues. In the Coca-Cola case, EU regulators could decide
to launch a full-scale investigation into the powerful drinking
company depending on any information investigators found in the
raids.
</P>
<P>
The raids hit again the American company in Europe as it just
recovers from a health scare last month that led to its drinks
being removed from stores in several European countries. The
crisis began after Belgian schoolchildren complained they fell
sick for drinking Coke.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Rebels Fire at Humanitarian Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- An Angolan military source Thursday
 confirmed that the rebel UNITA forces fired at two transport
planes on humanitarian mission at an airport in central Huambo
Province Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified source said that the two planes belong to the
World Food Program and the International Red Cross respectively.
They were transporting daily necessities and seeds to help some
223,000 refugees besieged in Huambo City.
</P>
<P>
At 4:00 p.m. Wednesday, the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) forces launched sudden attacks at
the planes by using long-range artillery. The planes took off
urgently, trying to return to capital Luanda. But the UNITA
rebels were still attempting to down them.
</P>
<P>
Later, the rebel forces bombarded the downtown and suburb of
Huambo City, killing three people of one family and wounding
several others.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA forces renewed its bombardment after the government
troops destroyed the rebels' artillery position outside the city
and re-opened the airport in Huambo, said the source.
</P>
<P>
He added that some UNITA soldiers early Monday morning tried to
 penetrate into the airport and destroy the infrastructures there,
but they were smashed by the Angolan government troops.

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak will meet Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat Saturday evening for their second summit since Barak took
office early this month, Barak's office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the prime minister's office said the two
leaders would meet at the Erez border crossing between Israel and
the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip and Barak would then travel to
Egypt to meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Barak is expected to discuss with Arafat the way of
implementing the Wye agreement signed last year. He has proposed
to combine the implementation of the interim agreement with the
final-status talks, but Arafat rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
Barak has met Arafat, Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah Bin
Hussein in a diplomatic whirlwind starting three days after he
assumed office on July 6.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Criticizes Barak Over Refugee Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
Thursday criticized Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak for his
recent remarks over the future of Palestinian refugees living in
neighboring Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Barak said in a meeting with United States President Bill
Clinton in Washington on Monday that "I don't believe they
(Palestinian refugees) will be able to return to Israel under any
circumstances and the hosting countries should accept them."
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon emphatically rejects Barak's assertions and will not
settle Palestinian refugees down in the country as this is
stipulated in the (Lebanese) Constitution," Hoss told a group of
visiting Lebanese emigrants.
</P>
<P>
He said it is good neither for the Palestinian refugees to
settle down in Lebanon nor for Lebanon to accept them.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office three week ago, Barak has often made some
remarks which are discouraging and make Lebanon not very
optimistic about the future peace process in the region, the
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Hoss was referring, partly, to Barak's suggestion to wrap the
interim Wye agreement between Israel and the Palestinians into the
final status talks, which was rejected by the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
During talks with clinton, Barak also set a 15-month timetable
for reaching comprehensive peace agreements with the Arab
countries. This also raised Palestinian concern that while
resuming talks with Syria and Lebanon, the implementations of the
Wye accord might be de-prioritized.
</P>
<P>
There are estimatedly 4 million Palestinian refugees scattered
in Arab countries, of whom 350,000 live in 12 refugee camps across
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Beirut fears that their naturalization would tip the delicate
sectarian balance that guarantee the peaceful co-existence between
Muslims and Christians in post-civil war Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> EU Concerned Over Angola Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on
Thursday expressed its serious concern over the situation in
Angola, saying the responsibility for the recent resumption of
civil war in the South African country "lies primarily with
UNITA", the National Union for Total Independence of Angola.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union intends to intensify its efforts to prevent
UNITA form continuing the civil war in Angola in persistent
defiance of U.N.Security Council Resolutions and to encourage
UNITA to return to the peace process," the EU said in a presidency
declaration on behalf of the 15 EU members.
</P>
<P>
The 15 European countries as a whole reiterated its commitment
to "maintaining strong international pressure on UNITA and its
leadership through the full implementation, by all UN member
states, of U.N. sanctions against UNITA".
</P>
<P>
The EU said that lasting peace in Angola can only be achieved
through political means. It urged UNITA and its leadership to stop
military activities and to show its will to resume dialogue in
good faith with the government of Angola on the basis of U.N.
Security Council Resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union is deeply concerned that as a consequence
of the latest outbreak of hostilities, the number of refugees and
displaced persons has risen dramatically, putting a risk on the
lives and wellbeing of a large part of the population," the
declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc also said it was particularly alarmed by the
number of internally displaced persons, now estimated at 1.7
million. "The European Union will continue to make all efforts to
provide humanitarian aid to the victims of the conflict and to
support demining," it added.

<HEADLINE> Food Shortage Situation Worsens in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Incessant conflicts in Somalia
has worsened the humanitarian situation already inflicted by food
shortages.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization noted
earlier this month that some one million Somalis are short of food
while 400,000 are on the brink of starvation due to food
shortages.
</P>
<P>
Abdi Mohamed, a farmer in Bur Hakaba town, about 185 kms south
of the capital along the Mogadishu-Baidoa road, said that he and
most of his friends couldn't go for farming just because of the
on-going conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed said the uncertain situation has not only forced them
to abstain from farming, but also compelled hundreds of families
to flee the area in fear of armed confrontations between the Oromo
Liberation Front fighters and Ethiopian troops in the region.
</P>
<P>
Lack of rains in the major rainy season from March to June has
also attributed to the situation of food shortage in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to the local authorities in Bay, Bakol, Lower and
Middle Jubba regions in the south, there is a serious food
shortage, especially the staple food items such as rice, maize,
sorghum, oil and sugar.
</P>
<P>
Some elders told Xinhua that many families cannot afford the
commodities available.
</P>
<P>
Ali Meris Mohamed, one the Rahanwein community elders, said
that most of the families now sustain their living with only one
meal per day.
</P>
<P>
The situation is especially serious in Bay, Bakol and Lower
Jubba regions in southern Somalia, while Hiran, Galgudud and Mudug
in the central region are also experiencing the same problem.
</P>
<P>
There had been reports of deaths for famine in the remote
villages of Mudug region. More than six people, four of whom
children, were reported to have died of famine in three villages
east of Galkaio town last week.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of families have reportedly moved from the countryside
to Galhareri, Dhusamareb, El-Bur and Adado districts of Galgudud
region owing to hunger and lack of potable water.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many of the towns are also having communication
problems owing to clan hostilities and other relative problems
such as banditry which hindered the smooth flow of both the
humanitarian and commercial traffic.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the humanitarian crises, the Wold Food Program,
the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) and some other international aid
agencies have already reopened their offices in Baidoa town, the
heart of the conflict between faction leader Hussein Aidid's
troops and the Rahanwein Resistance Army fighters. The two sides
are allegedly backed by Eritrea and Ethiopia respectively.
</P>
<P>
A large convoy of food aid by the WFP consisting of 1,050 tons
of miscellaneous food items has left the natural port town of
Merca early this week. However, the food convoy is yet to make to
Baidoa town owing to road problems.
</P>
<P>
In the town of Baidoa, the humanitarian flights have also begun
with a maximum of three flights per week.
</P>
<P>
More international aid agencies are also trying to estimate the
 situation by sending assessment teams to Baidoa for possible
humanitarian operations.
</P>
<P>
However, a full and meaningful humanitarian operation in
assisting the people of Bay and Bakol regions will need more
political settlement in the region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Steel Imports Fall 13 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The country's steel imports
dropped 13 percent in June after going up by nearly one-third a
month earlier, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In preliminary statistics, the department said imports totaled
2.7 million metric tons in June, down from 3 million a month
earlier. Imports rose 30 percent in May, following a drop in
April, an increase in March and another reduction in February.
</P>
<P>
Since November, when the Commerce Department first threatened
punitive tariffs on shipments of the industry's core product,
imports have gone down 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. steel industry has blamed low-priced imports for
thousands of layoffs and has charged more than a dozen foreign
countries and their steel producers with unlawful pricing
practices.
</P>
<P>
For the first six months of 1999, imports totaled 15.1 million
metric tons. That is still higher than the 14.7 million in the
first half of 1997, before the Asian economic crisis reduced
demand for steel abroad and prompted foreign producers to sell
their excesses in the U.S. market. Steel imports in the first half
of 1998 totaled 16.5 million.
</P>
<P>
The June reductions reflected reductions primarily in shipments
from Japan and Mexico. Indonesia, India and Spain also posted
large decreases. Steel numbers for Brazil and Russia, two
countries that agreed this month to curb shipments in order to
avoid tariffs, changed little in June.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Hails WTO Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand welcomes the decision
made by the World Trade Organization (WTO) to let its candidate
and his rival share the post of director-general, Thai Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said in a statement that the Thai government and people
support the decision which appoints former New Zealand prime
minister Mike Moore and Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi as WTO's next two consecutive leaders.
</P>
<P>
The General Council of the WTO has endorsed the term-sharing
arrangement Thursday in Geneva, putting an end to a bitter
leadership dispute within the 134-member organization which
polices global trade agreements and forms a key pillar in the
system of international economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said that he believes both More and Supachai will work
for the development of WTO, adding that Supachai's appointment as
the highest administrator of WTO is not only an honor to Thailand,
but also an honor to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as
well as all Asian countries and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the arrangement, Mike Moore is appointed as
Director-General for three years from September 1, 1999 to August
31, 2002. Supachai will succeed Moore from September 1, 2002 for
three years to August 31, 2005.
</P>
<P>
Supachai will be the first person from developing countries to
take up the top post in the three most important international
economic organizations, namely WTO, International Monetary Fund
and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The post of WTO director-general has been vacant since Renato
Ruggiero of Italy retired at the end of April.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli police Thursday prevented members of a
right-wing Jewish group from visiting the Temple Mount in
Jerusalem, citing "sensitive situation" following confrontation
between rightist Jews and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ra'anan Tal, police commander in charge of the Mount area, told
reporters that he could not permit the Jewish group Temple Mount
Faithful to enter the Al-Aqsa Mosque complex atop the mountain, a
move could spark conflict between Israeli and Palestinian
worshipers.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made after scuffle broke out between
Palestinians and members of the outlawed Jewish group Kach, who
threw pamphlets onto the site shortly after the beginning of the
Jewish holiday Tisha Be'av Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Jews pray and fast to observe Tisha Be'av, which commemorates
the destruction of the First Temple by the Babylonians in 586 BC
and the Second Temple by the Romans in 70 AD.
</P>
<P>

ULAN BATOR -- Mongolia's Great Hural, or parliament, voted 41-
22 Thursday to dismiss the government of Prime Minister Janlaviin
Narantsatsralt after two days of debate.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hural also decided that acting Minister of External
Relations Nyam-Osorin Tuyaa will act as the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The out-going prime minister was pressed to step down after his
private mail to the former First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia,
Yuri Maslyukov, was made public by the parliamentary group of the
Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) one week ago.
</P>
<P>
In that mail, Narantsatsralt reportedly leaked crucial
information about the Erdenet Copper and Molybdenum Mine, a very
important joint venture between Mongolia and Russia, to his
Russian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The bill to dismiss the government was initiated by 21
lawmakers from the ruling Mongolian Social Democratic Party and
the opposition MPRP who accused Narantsatsralt of bringing
substantial damage to the national interests.
</P>
<P>
Narantsatsralt was appointed Prime Minister on December 9 last
year. (Mongolia-Government-Dismissal)

<HEADLINE> Nigerian House Speaker Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- With tear-filled eyes and a plea for
 forgiveness, Nigeria's House Speaker Alhaji Buhari resigned
Thursday, ending his 11-day agony over perjury and forgery
allegations.
</P>
<P>
"I apologize to you, I apologize to the nation and to my family
and friends," he told the 360-member House of Representatives, or
lower chamber of the country's top legislature, as he announced
his decision to quit his post and membership there.
</P>
<P>
His resignation ended days of anxiety and speculation which
engulfed the nation following the allegations made by "the news",
a Lagos based newspaper on July 11.
</P>
<P>
Buhari, the number 4 in the country's hierarchy after the
president, his vice and the president of the 109-member Senate had
once dismissed that the allegations are "orchestrated" for
political purpose and insisted he would not back down.
</P>
<P>
But today, he confessed he had lied about his age and
qualification, claiming 36 years old while he was only 29 and
claiming to have attended the University of Toronto while he
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
"I was misled by my zeal to serve the nation," he said today,
yielding to days of pressure by various segments of this west
African country for him to go.
</P>
<P>
The country's police Thursday also confirmed their arrest of
the unlucky former speaker on charges of forgery and perjury.
</P>
<P>
"Interest of justice and tranquillity" in the country would be
best served by the interrogation of the former speaker, who was
released briefly today only to announce his resignation, according
to Young Arebamen, spokesman of the Nigerian police.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Approves 94 Export Processing Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Export Processing Zones
Authority (EPZA) Thursday said it had approved 94 projects valued
at 400 million U.S. dollars as of last month.
</P>
<P>
An EPZA official told the Zimbabwe News Agency, "The projects,
approved as of June 30, 1999, are expected to create employment
for 22,260 people."
</P>
<P>
The EPZA was established by an Act of Parliament in 1994 to
encourage local and foreign investors to set up businesses geared
primarily for export and employment creation.
</P>
<P>
Companies within the EPZA are given several incentives to
export, including duty free importation of capital goods and tax
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Companies within the EPZA have to export at least 80 percent of
their products, which accounts for their high export earnings,
beefed up last year by the depreciation of the Zimbabwean dollar
which lost more than 50 percent of its value against the U.S.
unit.
</P>
<P>
The EPZA has earmarked 1999 as the year to unfold a promotional
strategy for the EPZA program.

<HEADLINE> S. African Mining Industry Hard Hit by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Much fewer people were
employed by mines today than three years ago, according to the
latest census released on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The census revealed that 563,253 people were employed by South
African mines three years ago -- almost 90,000 more than today.
</P>
<P>
 But the data given by Statistics South Africa does give a
fully accurate picture on the changing fortunes of what used to be
the country's premier industry.
</P>
<P>
 The agency reported that in 1996 the total value of mining
sales was some 60 billion rand (6 billion U.S. dollars) with the
gold and uranium mines contributing 43 percent . Gold and uranium
mines, it said, employed 345,957 workers in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
But currently there is little uranium produced in South Africa
and the gold industry has slumped in recent times with an
estimated 60,000 gold miners losing their jobs during the
industry's main restructuring period in late 1997 and early 1998.
</P>
<P>
It said the total value of salaries and wages paid in the
mining sector was 17.98 billion rand (3.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
 While today's total remuneration figures were not available,
it is well known that more than half of the operating costs of
most South African gold mines is made up of labor.
</P>
<P>
The census discloses that in 1996 the total net profit of the
mining sector was approximately 12 billion rand (6 billion
dollars) with gold and uranium operations contributing 4.24
billion rand (700 million dollars), about 35.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Diana Owen-Thomas of the statistics department of the South
African Chamber of Mines in Johannesburg said that it was at odds
with the government department on the numbers still employed in
the mining industry.
</P>
<P>
While she agreed with the census figure, Owen-Thomas said that
figures given by government in March of approximately 403,000
people employed in the mining industry were more than 70,000 less
than the Chamber figures.
</P>
<P>
 "There is some conflict. We reckon there are between 475,000
and 480, 000 people working in the mining industry. I don't
believe the mines are paying people who are not there."
</P>
<P>
 Owen-Thomas added that employment at coal mines had not been
affected negatively like gold mines and that platinum mining
continued to employ some 90,000 to 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
 She said employment in South Africa's gold industry "took a
big tumble" from November 1997 to January 1998 when some 60,000
jobs were lost.
</P>
<P>
"However some of these miners were re-employed as
contractors," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Holland has donated one
million U.S. dollars to Ethiopia to help alleviate the country's
difficulties resulted from drought, said a press release available
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Justin Bagirishya, official of the United Nations World Food
Program (WFP), was quoted as saying that the Dutch donation would
give the WFP the much-needed flexibility to buy food for
distribution to Ethiopia's starving people.
</P>
<P>
People in many parts of Ethiopia reportedly have been suffering
from grain shortage in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
In parts of southern Ethiopia, people are eating the shells of
coffee beans, wild roots and dried leaves, according to Kirsten
Engebak of Act- Norwegian Church Aid, Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The food crisis in the Horn of Africa is due to the failure of
proper rains from February to May this year combined with poor
rains in 1998, local press said.
</P>
<P>
In March 1999, The WFP approved an emergency operation to
assist 272,000 people displaced by the Ethio-Eritrean conflict
which broke out in May last year.

JOHANNESBURG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The international AIDS
Conference 2000 was launched in Durban, South Africa Thursday,
introducing the theme "break the silence", South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be held next year at Durban's International
 Convention Center from July 9 to 14.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted organizers as saying the conference would be
attended by 12, 000 delegates from around the world, including
scientists, clinicians, public health agencies, people living with
AIDS, politicians and non- governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
A statement said the conference would enable delegates to
research the spread of the disease. It would also enable them to
evaluate progress made in medical research into the disease.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the conference highlighted the need to break the
silence on issues such as equal access to treatment and preventing
the spread of AIDS, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It would also focus on governmental and private sector support
in terms of providing education and resources and promoting a

JOHANNESBURG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The South African rand
Thursday ended stronger against the U.S. dollar, but it was off
its best intra-day level of 6.0850.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said a huge dollar order by a local financial
institution pushed the rand off its best level. And the gold price
dipped below the 255-dollar per ounce level this afternoon,
denting some of the rand's morning gains.

<HEADLINE> Reppas: Greek-Turkish Dialogue Will Proceed as Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Recent developments would not
affect the planned dialogue between Greece and Turkey, which would
take place next Monday in Ankara, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the recent statements by Turkish Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit concerning the Cyprus problem, the
harassment of Greek Transport Minister Tassos Mantelis's plane and
the violation of the Athens Flight Information Region (FIR) by
Turkish fighter jets Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's actions should be addressed by the international
community, Reppas said, adding that Greece would under no
circumstances allow itself to become inactive or a captive to the
situation.
</P>
<P>
As for the notice issued by Turkey to airmen, which requested
that certain areas of the Aegean Sea be reserved for Turkish air
and naval exercises during the two-month moratorium on military
flights over the Aegean during the summer agreed by Greece and
Turkey, he said that this illustrated Turkey's inability to
contribute to the normalization of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned that Turkey would have to bear the entire
diplomatic and political cost of its actions.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both members of NATO, have been at odds over
decades for their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits, and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the
Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the two neighboring countries have restart
the dialogue in order to improve their strained relations.
</P>
<P>
Senior foreign ministry officials of the two countries will
meet in Ankara next Monday to discuss bilateral cooperation in the
field of economy and culture, and then they will hold talks in
Athens some time in the future.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Passes Tax Cut Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Thursday passed a 10-year, 792 billion dollar tax
cut bill which is strongly opposed by President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Republican bill was passed by a vote of 223-208, with only
four Republicans lawmakers breaking ranks and voting against the
measure. Six Democrats also supported the measure.
</P>
<P>
Republicans said that in an age of huge budget surpluses, they
could give Americans the tax relief they deserve and still assure
the future solvency of Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton, who said the Republican tax cut plan
would fail to pay down the national debt or add to the life of Social
Security and Medicare, has vowed to "veto it if it passes."
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Democrats supported a considerably smaller level of
tax cuts, of around 250 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
A Democratic bill seeking the small tax cut level was defeated
earlier Thursday by a vote of 258-1.
</P>
<P>
The House bill highlights the sharp differences between
Republicans and the White House over how to manage a projected 2.9
trillion dollar surplus over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and the Democrats want to use most of the surplus to
ensure the future of Social Security and Medicare and add a
prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
They also want to set aside part of the annual surpluses for
increases in defense and education spending.
</P>
<P>
But the Republicans insisted that the surplus should be used
to cut tax to return money to the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
The bill now goes to the Senate, which is expected to vote next
week on a measure that differs in details but also provides nearly
800 billion dollars in tax cut.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Kennedy Family Members Say Farewell at Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Kennedy family members
aboard a Navy destroyer committed the ashes of John F. Kennedy
Jr., his wife and sister-in-law into the water in the Atlantic
Ocean Thursday, at a site not far from where they died.
</P>
<P>
A group of about 15 relatives carried the cremated remains of
Kennedy, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette onto the USS
Briscoe. Their ashes were committed to the sea off Martha's
Vineyard in Massachusetts State.
</P>
<P>
The Briscoe spent about half an hour nearly motionless off the
Vineyard's southwest coast, four or five kilometers from the crash
site of the young Kennedy's plane. Mourners could be seen moving
down to the stern, where a flag was lowered to half-mast as the
group was seated, flanked by sailors in dress whites.
</P>
<P>
After a short time, during which at least two people appeared
to rise and speak, passengers returned to the upper deck and the
flag was taken down.
</P>
<P>
The Briscoe turned around and headed back to the Woods Hole
port on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
Navy divers recovered the three bodies Wednesday in murky
waters off Martha's Vineyard, 40 meters below the surface and 11
kilometers from shore.
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed on July 16 while carrying Kennedy, 38, his
wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her sister Lauren
Bessette, 34. Kennedy, the pilot, planned to drop off his
sister-in-law in Martha's Vineyard and continue to his cousin's
wedding in Hyannis Port.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plays Down Dispute With U.N. Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States downplayed on
Thursday its dispute with the United Nations over who is moving
too slowly in the peace-keeping operation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times Thursday quoted a United Nations official as
saying that it's not the U.N. that's dragging its feet, it's NATO
that is slow in deploying enough soldiers to create a secure
environment.
</P>
<P>
"I think both the U.N. and NATO are doing an extraordinary job
in a very difficult circumstance of deploying people and resources
to Kosovo under extremely challenging circumstances," State
Department spokesman James Rubin told a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the report by The New York Times is "being blown out
of proportion."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's a real issue here, it's mid-July and
people don't have much to write about, and so I think it's being
blown out of proportion," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin commended the job by NATO while complaining the
United Nations moves too slow.
</P>
<P>
"I think the fact that the bulk of NATO's deployment is already
there in a very short, short time demonstrates that NATO is
capable of acting quickly and effectively, as one would expect
from a military organization," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. is not a military organization, he said. "They
don't have reserves on issues like police and civilian
administrators. They have to start from scratch each time."
</P>
<P>
"We do think the U.N. is moving rapidly, but we do think the
U.N. also can move more quickly, to create a fully functioning
interim civil administration at all levels," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"We also want to the U.N. to deploy as rapidly as possible
international civilian police who will take interim responsibility
for law and order in the province," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has offered 100 police now, but the U.N. says
they're not ready to use those police until September. "That's an
example of th bureaucracy moving slowly," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen complained
that because the U.N. was slow in deploying people and resources
to the Balkans, NATO forces had to perform tasks that the United
Nations should be carrying out.
</P>
<P>
However, John Ruggie, a senior U.N. official, said that the
United Nations was moving "according to plan" in Kosovo and people
and resources were being sent to the region at an "unprecedented"
pace.
</P>
<P>
Ruggie was quoted by The New York Times as saying that it is
not the job of the projected 3,110-member international police
force as Cohen suggested to insure a secure environment, public
safety and civilians freedom to move.
</P>
<P>
NATO is supposed to do the job and only after a secure
environment has been established is the U.N. international police
force supposed to begin insuring law and order, Ruggie added.
</P>
<P>
The NATO force stands at 34,000 troops and 16,000 soldiers
short of the commitments, according to Ruggie.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pentagon: Computers Linked to Nuclear Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
announced Thursday that nearly all U.S. defense computers linked
to nuclear weapons have been verified through testing as ready for
the Year 2000 computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
"There is no risk of accidental launch" or of losing the
ability to fire U.S. weapons if necessary, said Richard Mies,
commander of U.S. Strategic Command, at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
There is no basis to fear a Y2K glitch would affect control of
U.S. nuclear weapons, Mies said.
</P>
<P>
"Procedures for launching our nation's nuclear weapons involve
multiple levels of safeguards such as code verifications and human
interactions to verify and authenticate an order from the
president," Mies said. "Computers by themselves cannot launch
nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Mies said fears that a Y2K computer bug will shut
down the U.S. nuclear arsenal are unfounded, based on extensive
tests that included simulations of launches of every type of
nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen, appearing with Mies at the
Pentagon, said he had been "deeply concerned" a year ago that the
Defense Department was moving too slowly to prepare for Y2K. Since
then, he said, the department has gone all out to test and
validate its computers.
</P>
<P>
"I am reassured and confident that we will defeat the Y2K
attack when it comes on January 1, 2000," Cohen said.

<HEADLINE> Online Shopping Pushing Up Worldwide Electronic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide market for
electronic software commerce is expanding as more businesses and
consumers get accustomed to shopping on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released Thursday by U.S. market research
firm International Data Corporation (IDC), the market will be
worth 3.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1999 and is expected to reach
32.9 billion dollars by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Online retailers are taking a major share of this market and
will continue to command the end-user experience as they improve
their customer tracking and product management, IDC said.
</P>
<P>
Electronic software commerce consists of the sales of software
online, irrespective of the method of delivery. IDC said that the
market is being driven by a surge in the number of online
"e-tailers" with more sophisticated customer tracking and product
management techniques and will be driven by the continued
migration of computer users to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
In addition, IDC said, software vendors are increasingly
recognizing the need to provide end users with more options for
acquiring software, including direct Internet sales and the
electronic delivery of both software and licenses.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Pledges Quick Move if Inflation Picks Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan told Congress Thursday that the central bank would "act
promptly and forcefully" to prevent any pick-up in inflation.
</P>
<P>
In a key testimony on economic conditions to U.S. lawmakers,
Greenspan defended the decision three weeks ago to nudge a key
interest rate up by a quarter-point, the first increase in two
years.
</P>
<P>
"To have refrained from doing so in our judgment would have put
the U.S. economy at risk," Greenspan told the House Banking
Committee in his twice-yearly monetary policy report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said that low unemployment and continued strong consumer
spending make it essential for the Fed to be "especially alert to
inflation risks."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said, "If new data suggest it is likely that the pace
of cost and price increases will be picking up, the Federal
Reserve will have to act promptly and forcefully so as to preclude
imbalances from arising that would only require a more disruptive
adjustment later."
</P>
<P>
While stressing the Fed was ready to act at the first sign that
inflation was heating up, Greenspan did not signal in his prepared
remarks that such a move was imminent.
</P>
<P>
After increasing the federal funds rate on June 30, the Fed
announced it was adopting a so-called neutral stance, indicating a
wait-and-see approach.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the high-flying stock market had been bolstered
by a healthy upturn in U.S. workers' productivity. But he
cautioned investors against becoming overly optimistic that the
strong gains in productivity witnessed in recent years could be
sustained in the future.
</P>
<P>
He said there was the risk of a "euphoric" run-up in stock
prices that could propel the market to unsupportable levels.
</P>
<P>
"The danger is that in these circumstances, an unwarranted,
perhaps euphoric, extension of recent developments can drive
equity prices to levels that are unsupportable," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
Should the stock market undergo a serious correction, he said,
"it is the job of economic policy-makers to mitigate the fallout
when it occurs and, hopefully, ease the transition to the next
expansion."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan devoted an entire section of his testimony to
"pre-emptive policy-making," saying that in order to keep alive
the eight-year-old economic expansion, already the longest in
peacetime history, the Fed must be alert to risks that inflation
could be getting out of control.
</P>
<P>
"While product prices have remained remarkably restrained in
the face of exceptionally strong demand and expanding potential
supply, it is imperative that we do not become complacent,"
Greenspan said. The Fed's policymaking committee next meets on
Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, who appears before Congress twice a year to provide
an update on the central bank's views, called the performance so
far in 1999 "an exceptional year for the American economy" with
almost 1.25 million jobs being created and no pickup yet in
consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Greenspan's testimony to Congress, the Fed
released a revised economic forecast that tracked closely with
recent forecasts by the administration and the Congressional
Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
The Fed predicted the economy, as measured by the gross
domestic product, will expand this year at an annual rate of
around 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent. That compared to the
administration's slightly lower forecast of 3.2 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
The Fed also predicted growth would slow further next year to
2.5 percent to 3 percent, compared to an administration forecast
of 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
On inflation, the Fed saw consumer prices rising around 2.25
percent to 2.5 percent this year and 2 percent to 2.5 percent
last, up from an increase of 1.6 percent last year.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) has warned that HIV/AIDS has reached a catastrophic
proportion in eastern and southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF said in a press statement issued here Thursday that
1.4 million people including children in the region were killed by
AIDS in 1998 alone.
</P>
<P>
The region is hardest hit in the world, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We are confronting a deadly virus that has crippled apart the
social fabrics of societies across Africa, creating a generation
of orphans who face an uncertain future," the statement quoted
UNICEF Deputy Executive Director, Stephen Lewis, as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to UNICEF representative Ibrahim Jabr, the pandemic
has left six million children orphaned in the region, which
represents over 70 percent of the world's AIDS orphans.

<HEADLINE> EU-S. African Trade Accord to Affect Region: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries
were warned Thursday to expect few benefits from the South
African-European Union (EU) trade agreement save those they can
earn for themselves, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
"There may not be so much on the positive side, but potential
for trade development in the BLNS countries (Botswana, Namibia,
Lesotho and Swaziland) does exist under the agreement," said Jan
Isaksen, Executive Director of the Botswana Institute for Policy
Analysis.
</P>
<P>
"What happens depends on what they do. The private sectors in
those countries must take up the challenge and run with it,"
Isaksen was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The analyst was speaking at a two-day conference in Gaborone,
Botswana, to examine the effect of the agreement on the 14-member
states of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and
the four BLNS countries, also SADC members, which together with
South Africa make up the Southern African Customs Union.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's chief negotiator at the talks with the EU, Bahle
Sibisi, who is also South Africa's chief director of trade and
industry, said that opportunities would arise for the region to
take advantage of gaps in export schedules to the EU that South
Africa could not fill.
</P>
<P>
South Africa would maintain customs union and trade agreements
with regional countries only if they were consistent with its own
development policy.
</P>
<P>
"Pain will be felt fast, benefits will accrue more slowly.
Some will lose out under the pressure of competition," he said.
</P>
<P>
Head of the EU delegation to Botswana, Robert Collingwood, said
some countries would lose while some would benefit.
</P>
<P>
"But we think over the region the benefits will outweigh the
costs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU-South African agreement provides for free trade between
them with the progressive elimination of tariffs on industrial
goods over 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Some tariffs on agricultural products will be "liberalized"
over the same period, others reviewed periodically.

<HEADLINE> Zambian People Urged to Fight Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government attributed the
spreading of HIV/AIDS to the selfish attitudes which many people
take without thinking about the repercussions thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health Nkandu Luo who was launching the 1999 report
on the progress of nations said Thursday in Lusaka that many
people do not think beyond themselves to the extent that they
indulge in unprotected sex without thinking of long term impact it
will bring to the children.
</P>
<P>
She said it was not an accident that many people were getting
HIV/AIDS and dying from the infection despite a lot of money being
spent on information about HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that there was need to take stock of what
has been done in the fight against AIDS as, a lot of money has
been spent on the program.
</P>
<P>
She further called for intervention programs in the fight
against HIV/ AIDS and give alternatives to empower the people by
way of capacity building.
</P>
<P>
It is important that voluntary HIV/AIDS testing will give
people an opportunity to plan for their future and their families
once they know their status, she said.
</P>
<P>
She further noted that the 1999 progress of the nations report
focuses on issues which affect Zambian families especially the
women and children.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, representative of the United Nations International
Children's Fund (UNICEF), Peter Macdermott said Zambia occupies a
second position on the number of orphans in the world due to
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
He said HIV/AIDS is the single greatest threat to stability,
development and economic growth in the country because Zambia
occupies the second highest number of HIV/AIDS affected orphans in
the world.
</P>
<P>
He hopes that the world's politicians and media will focus on
Zambia and its HIV/AIDS program as never before.
</P>
<P>
While so much has been done to date so much more needed to be
done now and with greater sense of urgency because gains can be
made especially in the area of prevention and mother to child
transmission, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Sell Bank Shares to S. African Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Executive Chairman of the Presidential Parastatal Sector Reform
 Commission, John Rubumbe, said in Dar es Salaam that the decision
to sell the majority stake in the bank is in line with the
government's initiative to reform and strengthen the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
Rubumbe said ABSA Group Ltd. is one among the four financial
institutions that bade to acquire the majority shares in the
public firm. The rest are Barclays Bank PLC of Britain, First
Adili Bancorp /Tanzania Consortium and Stanbic Bank (Tanzania)
Limited.
</P>
<P>
"Results arising from the evaluation exercise that followed
showed that ABSA group Limited was the winning bidder and it was
invited for the negotiations," Rubumbe said.
</P>
<P>
He said the process to divest the National Bank of Commerce
Ltd. effectively started in 1998 and that the tender for the
purchase of the majority share holding in the bank was initially
scheduled to close on October 30 last year but was later
rescheduled to November.
</P>
<P>
By November 30 last year, four bids were received but the
subsequent screening of the bids disqualified all of the bidders,
Rubumbe said.
</P>
<P>
He said fresh bids were invited, and the previous four bidders
were also invited to submit improved bids, he said.
</P>
<P>
ABSA Executive Director Jean Brown, who signed the pact on
behalf of his firm, said that the signing of the memorandum
signifies a step further in fostering closer economic cooperation
among the Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries.
</P>
<P>
Brown said his group was the largest bank in South Africa,
which has over 1,000 branches and outlets in the country. It also
has branches in London, Hamburg, Hong Kong and Singapore with a
number of 36,000 staff.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Journalists Lash out Taiwan Leader's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Union of Journalists
(NUJ) Thursday lashed out Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui's latest
attempt to split China.
</P>
<P>
"We support the sovereignty of China over the province of
Taiwan," Malam Muhammad Khalid, national secretary of the union,
said in a statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian journalists said in their statement that the
latest claim by Lee "was intended to create division between China
and its province... to make it vulnerable to Western domination."
</P>
<P>
Recently, Lee flagrantly described the cross-strait relations
as "state- to-state" relations, which is a very dangerous step he
has taken toward splitting the country, and a severe provocation
to the "one China" principle recognized by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
This further exposed Lee's nature to split China's territory
and sovereignty, and his attempt to separate Taiwan from China,
</P>
<P>
Blaming "imperialists, hegemonists and those prepared to
enslave the world" for this latest gamble by Taiwan, the
journalists union said that " Taiwan must remain an integral part
of China."
</P>
<P>
"All Nigerian journalists support the determination of China to
keep its territory together and free it from hegemonism," it
noted.
</P>
<P>
The union urged the present generation of China to "ensure a
united China and maintain her steady growth into the next
millenium."
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has said that the realization of
the reunification of the motherland is the strong determination of
the Chinese government, and is also the common aspiration of the
entire Chinese people, including Taiwan compatriots and overseas
compatriots as well.

ABUJA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's House of Representatives
Thursday elected Malam Ghali Na'abba as its new speaker, barely
hours after the resignation of Ibrahim Buhari over allegations of
forgery and perjury.
</P>
<P>
Ghali, 61, member of the ruling People's Democratic Party,
represents the municipal constituency of Kano State, northeastern
Nigeria, the same state with the disgraced former speaker.
</P>
<P>
The unopposed election of Ghali provided a tranquil end to a
day which started with a bang with the resignation of the former
speaker after his admitting to allegations made by a Lagos-based
magazine that he lied about his age and qualification.
</P>
<P>
The new speaker pledged to work with other members of the lower
house in the defense of democracy and protecting the interests of
the electorate.
</P>
<P>
Describing his responsibility as "enormous", Ghali called on
members to join hands with him to discharge the mandate in the

<HEADLINE> Barak, Clinton Hold Phone Conversation on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Ahead of his second round of
meetings with Arab leaders, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak held
a telephone conversation with United States President Bill Clinton
on advancing the peace process, Israel Radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton briefed Barak on his own telephone talks with
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat early
this week, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In that conversation, Clinton reportedly assured Arafat that
Barak had promised to carry out all signed agreements with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat are to meet midnight Saturday at the Erez
check point between Israel and the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who returned from talks in the U.S. and Britain Tuesday,
also plans to fly to Egypt on Sunday to meet President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Danny Yatom, Barak's security adviser, told Israel
Television's Channel Two on Friday that Barak would also see
Jordan's King Abdullah Bin Hussein in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Washington last week, Barak had held his
first round of talks with the three leaders, only days after he
assumed office on July 6.
</P>
<P>
Yatom noted that Barak would suggest in his further talks with
Arafat to combine the last part of the U.S.-brokered Wye accord,
signed last October and then frozen by Barak's predecessor
Benjamin Netanyahu, with the negotiations on a final peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinians have repeatedly rejected such
proposals and insisted on a full implementation of the interim
agreement, which stipulates a three-phase Israeli withdrawal from
13.1 percent of the West Bank.

The survey attributed the rise in the market to the wider use

<HEADLINE> Russian Foreign Debt Accounts for 90 Percent of GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia's foreign debt stands at
some 150 billion U.S. dollars, or 90 percent of its gross domestic
product (GDP), according to a document of the Russian government
and the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
In an economic policy memorandum for 1999 handed over to the
International Monetary Fund, the government's scheduled foreign
debt payments are projected to amount to about 90 percent of the
federal budget revenue, "well beyond any realistic threshold for
repayment capacity."
</P>
<P>
According to the document, which was released by the IMF
Friday, Russia is "seeking a re-scheduling on debt-service
obligations on external debt accumulated prior to January 1, 1992,
the effective Paris Club cutoff date for debt of the former Soviet
Union, while paying in full obligations accumulated by Russia
since then."
</P>
<P>
The Russian government also pledged to "continue to make best
efforts" to reach agreement with the remaining holders of GKO
treasury bills and OFZ bonds who did not take part in a
restructuring plan for this debt, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Where agreement cannot be reached, we will honor obligations
according to the original terms, although the transferability of
proceeds from such payments will be subject to restrictions," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The document also said that the government would keep
inflation under 50 percent until next December.
</P>
<P>
The hard currency component of the country's current accounts
will be increased to 8 percent of GDP by the end of the year by
sharply cutting imports, while gross reserves will probably remain
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The government and Central Bank forecast a drop of 2 percent
in GDP in real terms this year.

<HEADLINE> Portugal's Stand on Angolan War Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the ruling
People's Liberation Movement (MPLA) of Angola Joao Lourenco
described Portugal's stand on the conflicts in Angola as "naive
and unfair," the official Angolan news agency ANGOP reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The MPLA leader made the remarks apparently in reaction to a
statement jointly issued by Portuguese Prime Minister antonio
Guterres and opposition Social Democratic Party leader Jose Manuel
Durao Barroso in mid July.
</P>
<P>
The statement called upon the Angolan government to immediately
hold peace talks with the rebel National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) and abandon war as "the only way
out."
</P>
<P>
Lourenco pointed out that it was "very imprudent" for Portugal,
as an observer monitoring the implementation of the 1994 Lusaka
peace accord and the sponsor of the Bicesse Accord, to make such
an unfair statement.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the "military bandits" could not be treated
equally as a lawful government, hinting that Portugal was either
too naive or could not see the true facts in the Angolan
situation.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party leader noted that "the war in Angola has been
waged by (UNITA Chairman) Jonas Savimbi" and no country in the
world would allow any of its citizens to maintain an army against
the government.
</P>
<P>
As the fighting between the two warring sides in Angola has
reached a stalemate, the international community have raised their
voice to call for peace talks. Even the Catholic church in Angola
has expressed its willingness to play the role as a mediator.
</P>
<P>
However, the Angolan government has stated repeatedly that it
would never negotiate with the UNITA rebels.

In the second half of this year, Guangdong will give priority
to further tapping domestic and overseas markets, and try every
means to increase the incomes of both urban and rural residents.

<HEADLINE> African Women Educationists Call for Gender Equity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Women educationists attending the
Fourth General Assembly of the Forum for African Women
Educationists (FAWE) Friday appealed to the need for gender equity
and improvement in the quality of education for girls in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 women educationists from 31 sub-Saharan African
countries including ministers of education and vice-chancellors of
universities viewed their considerations on how to meet the
challenges to girl's education in the next millennium at the
three-day assembly which ended here Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Kenyan Education Minister Stephen Musyoka
told the participants that about 30 million girls in sub-Saharan
Africa have no access to basic education and by the year 2015, 39
million female children in the region will be out of school.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that about half of the girls enrolled in
primary education in Africa drop out of school before acquiring
functional education, saying that the completion rate in primary
school cycle in Kenya remains at 35 percent for girls and 55
percent for boys.
</P>
<P>
He said the dream for achieving education for all in
sub-Saharan Africa remained elusive and urged the governments in
the region to overcome the hurdles for girls' education such as
increasing poverty at household level, the traditional cultural
practices and high population growth rates.
</P>
<P>
At the workshop, the participants also discussed such topics as
girls' safety and drug abuse in school, sexual harassment in
universities, AIDS and girls' education, persistent cultural
practices that affect girls' education and reproductive health
issues on girls.
</P>
<P>
The participants also decided to set up a policy center to
regulate gender-related issues and make accessible, useful data on
education in the continent.
</P>
<P>
During the assembly, a girls' forum was held simultaneously
with representation from 13 African countries where girls
exchanged their educational experiences in each respective states.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Experts and scholars attending the
Fourth Cross-Straits Symposium on Astronomical Education held here
today called on the whole of society to wipe out feudal
superstition and safeguard the dignity of science.
</P>
<P>
Wang Kemin, deputy director of the Beijing Observatory under
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that the central government'
s decision on handling the Falun Gong issue was quite right, as it
is beneficial to the stability of the political situation, adding
that the illegal activities of Falun Gong have seriously disrupted
public order, misguided people, and confused right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
Lu Benkui, director of the Nanjing Zijinshan Observatory, noted
that Falun Gong is a brazen challenge to science. It was wise for
the Chinese central government to outlaw the sect, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that only by raising the scientific and cultural
levels of the whole nation, can the people resist idealism and
theism.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers from Taiwan also expressed their opinions about
Falun Gong, saying that it denies all science and truth, and
contradicts modern science and modern civilization.

<TEXT>
<P>
Asked to comment on the amendment, Zhu said that the amendment,
demanding that China promise to give up the right to use force
against Taiwan and agitating the U.S. to provide weapons to Taiwan,
seriously infringes upon China's sovereignty and grossly
interferes in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Both the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Chinese embassy in
Washington D.C. have made solemn representations to the U.S. side
about the matter, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Taiwan is related to China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, and associated with the national feelings
of the 1.2 billion Chinese people, Zhu said, adding that it is the
strong aspiration of the entire Chinese people to realize the
complete reunification of China at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government hopes to reunify China through peaceful
means, but it will not promise to abandon the use of force,
because there exist forces both in Taiwan and in the international
arena attempting to split Taiwan from China, Zhu noted. If China
commits itself to not using force, hope for the peaceful
reunification of the country will be lost, he said.

Zhu went on to say that the Chinese government and people are
resolved to maintain their state sovereignty and territorial
integrity, and oppose splittism.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui has openly defined the relations across the Taiwan
Straits as "state-to-state" relations, and spared no effort to
create the theory of "two states", Zhu noted. However, Lee's
attempt to split the motherland is doomed to fail, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that recently some people in the U.S. have repeatedly
harped on the same string by raising anti-China bills related to
Taiwan according to the so called "Taiwan Relations Act", and they
advocate activities interfering in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
It must be pointed out that the "Taiwan Relations Act" is a
serious violation of the Sino-U.S. communique on the establishment
of diplomatic ties between the two countries, Zhu said. It is a
major obstacle to the development of Sino-U.S. relations by
attempting to maintain, in disguised form, the U.S.'s official and
military ties with Taiwan through domestic laws, Zhu stressed.
</P>
<P>
The "Taiwan Relations Act" has met the strong opposition of the
Chinese government and people since it came out in 1979, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that the U.S. government strictly abide by the three
Sino-U.S. joint communiques and the related commitments, and
prevent the amendment seeking "a public renunciation by China of
any use of force against Taiwan" to become law.

<HEADLINE> China Issues First White Paper on Shipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The 1998 China Shipping
Development Report, the country's first white paper on shipping,
was issued here today at the Shanghai Shipping Exchange.
</P>
<P>
This is the country's first authoritative annual report
explaining its policies, strategies and development as regards
shipping, a local source said.
</P>
<P>
The issuing of a white paper is an important means for a
country, region or international organization to regularize
markets, guide enterprises and seek cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China has made much headway in shipping development in recent
years, and has been an A-class member state of the council of the
International Shipping Organization for five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has signed marine and river shipping agreements
with more than 50 countries and regions. The Shipping Department
under the Ministry of Communications, the Shanghai Shipping
Exchange and the Shanghai Mercantile Marine College have jointly
compiled the report.
</P>
<P>
The white paper has nine chapters and 300,000 Chinese
characters, covering various aspects of China's shipping
development, such as domestic and international shipping,
international container services, port services, international
shipping agencies, and the policies and rules governing shipping.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, China's cargo shipping and turnover
volumes topped 1.18 billion tons and 1.93 trillion tons,
respectively, in 1998, representing rises of 4.6 percent and 0.7
percent from a year earlier.

BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Following are highlights of
diplomatic news released by Xinhua today:
</P>
<P>
China Criticizes U.S. Congressional Amendment for Supporting
Lee Teng-hui
</P>
<P>
A recent amendment to the "State Department Authorization Act
(Fiscal Year 2000 and 2001)" of the U.S. House of Representatives
supports Lee Teng-hui's "two-states" remarks, China's National
People's Congress Foreign Affairs Committee was quoted as saying
today.
</P>
<P>
It makes every effort to support "Taiwan independence" forces
and attempts to put obstacles in the path of China's peaceful
reunification, the Committee said.
</P>
<P>
The amendment, put forward by Robert Andrews, demands that "the
U.S. president seek a public renunciation by China of any use of
force or threat to use force against Taiwan," and says that "the U.
S. should help Taiwan defend itself in case of threats or a
military attack by China."
</P>
<P>
Lee made his "two states" remarks on July 9th in an attempt to
negate the "one China" policy and to separate China. In betraying
the nation and using Taiwan compatriots as the stakes, Lee Teng-
hui wantonly decided to call cross-straits relations "state-to-
state" and took a very dangerous step on the pathway of dividing
the country.
</P>
<P>
This act has exposed entirely his determination to separate
Chinese sovereignty and territory and to separate Taiwan from
China.
</P>
<P>
Solving the Taiwan issue and reunifying the motherland is the
common aspiration of all Chinese people, the Committee says,
adding that the Chinese government's basic policy on the
settlement of the Taiwan issue is "peaceful reunification" and "
one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
However, it says, the Chinese government does not commit itself
to not using force. This is needed against the "Taiwan
independence" separatists and some international forces that are
attempting to separate Taiwan from China.
</P>
<P>
China will in no way sit idly by if some people work for "
Taiwan independence" and foreign forces interfere in the country's
reunification cause, President Jiang Zemin said on July 18 in a
telephone conversation with President Clinton.

FM Spokesman Condemns U.S. Congressional Amendment
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people are firmly opposed to the
amendment to the "State Department Authorization Act (Fiscal Year
2000 and 2001)" relating to Taiwan passed by the U.S. House of
Representatives, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the amendment, Zhu said that the amendment,
demanding that China promise to give up the right to use force
against Taiwan and agitating the U.S. to provide weapons to Taiwan,
seriously infringes upon China's sovereignty and grossly
interferes in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Both the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Chinese embassy in
Washington D.C. have made solemn representations to the U.S. side
about the matter, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Taiwan is related to China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, and associated with the national feelings
of the 1.2 billion Chinese people, Zhu said, adding that it is the
strong aspiration of the entire Chinese people to realize the
complete reunification of China at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government hopes to reunify China through peaceful
means, but it will not promise to abandon the use of force,
because there exist forces both in Taiwan and in the international
arena attempting to split Taiwan from China, Zhu noted. If China
commits itself to not using force, hope for the peaceful
reunification of the country will be lost, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu went on to say that the Chinese government and people are
resolved to maintain their state sovereignty and territorial
integrity, and oppose splittism.
</P>
<P>
It must be pointed out that the "Taiwan Relations Act" is a
serious violation of the Sino-U.S. communique on the establishment
of diplomatic ties between the two countries, Zhu said. It is a
major obstacle to the development of Sino-U.S. relations by
attempting to maintain, in disguised form, the U.S.'s official and
military ties with Taiwan through domestic laws, Zhu stressed.
</P>
<P>
The "Taiwan Relations Act" has met the strong opposition of the
Chinese government and people since it came out in 1979, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
We demand that the U.S. government strictly abide by the three
Sino-U.S. joint communiques and the related commitments, and
prevent the amendment seeking "a public renunciation by China of
any use of force against Taiwan" to become law.

<HEADLINE> Manila Urged to Help 1.5 Million Street Kids Nationwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has been
urged to help the country's street children, whose number has been
jumped from 223,000 in 1991 to 1.5 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Herrera, a member of the country's House of
Representatives, said Friday that he was alarmed by the seven-fold
increase and hoped the government to set up the Children's Welfare
Fund early to help deal with this pressing problem.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics culled from a United Nations study, Herrera
said that the number is just the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
He added that figures from the Department of Social Welfare and
Development show that from 1991 to 1997, the number of reported
cases of child abuse and exploitation jumped more than six times.
</P>
<P>
"Street children are just one segment of a growing number of
exploited and abused children nationwide," he said.
</P>
<P>
The legislator estimated that the country has some 5 million
exploited children, comprising 18 percent of the under-18-year-old
group.
</P>
<P>
Herrera has filed a bill establishing the Children's Welfare
Fund for the protection and rehabilitation of abandoned, abused
and sexually-exploited children.
</P>
<P>
The bill designates the Social Welfare Department headed by
Philippine Vice President Gloria Macapagal Arroyoto to manage the
fund set initially at 100 million pesos (2.5 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the fund will be used to set up and operate
facilities for the rehabilitation of exploited children, as well
as for the formal education of these children.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Garment Exports Increase Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia earned 275 million
U.S. dollars from garment exports in the first six month of this
year, a 96 percent year-on-year increase, a local newspaper quoted
the Ministry of Commerce as reporting Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry recorded the figure of the same period of last
year at 140.5 million U.S. dollars, the Commercial News said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the garment exports went to the European Union and
elsewhere, while the garment exports to the United States this
year are affected by the quotas it implemented on Cambodia in
April.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has benefited from special trade privileges from the
United States since 1996 and low tariffs provided under the
European Union's Generalized System of Preferences.
</P>
<P>
Garment exports from Cambodia in 1998 stood at 360 million U.S.
dollars and three-fourths of them went to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Officials, Employees of Central Organs Support Falun Gong Ban (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Officials, Party members and
ordinary employees of departments and enterprises of China's
central authorities said here today that they fully support the
government ban on Falun Gong, an unregistered illegal organization
spreading superstitious and heretical ideas, and disrupting social
stability in the name of physical fitness exercises.
</P>
<P>
The Party Central Committee has made a significant decision in
a resolute and timely manner, and has taken effective measures
which have won the heartfelt support of the people, many of them
noted.
</P>
<P>
China's ministries of civil affairs and public security
Thursday announced that Falun Gong, founded and headed by Li
Hongzhi, was illegal and imposed a nationwide ban on it. The
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) also
issued a circular forbidding all Party members to practice Falun
Gong.
</P>
<P>
The ban on Falun Gong represents the fundamental interests and
common aspirations of the Chinese people, said an employee of the
General Office of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Under the pretext of 'promoting health', the Falun Gong
organizations have conducted many illegal activities which
seriously disturbed the normal order of society, confused the
people's moral and ethical concepts, deceived many innocent people
and inflicted enormous harm on their physical and mental health,"
said one researcher at the Party School of the CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong constitutes a serious disturbance to the cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the overall
situation of reform, development and stability, and therefore must
not be allowed to continue to exist and further develop, noted the
researcher.
</P>
<P>
According to journalists in news media affiliated to the
central authorities, such as People's Daily, Qiushi magazine and
China Daily, the current struggle against Falun Gong is a "serious
political struggle" in which the two sides are fighting for the
occupation of the ideological front and for public support.
</P>
<P>
"Whether we can win the victory in this struggle will have a
bearing on the guiding role of Marxism in our Party, on the
consolidation of our Party's ruling party status and public
support, as well as on the future and destiny of the Party and the
state," said an editor at Guangming Daily.

<HEADLINE> Officials, Employees Of Central Authorities Organs Support Falun Gong Ban (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many former Falun Gong practitioners in the central authorities
departments repented that they had exercised Falun Gong because
they were deceived and never got a chance to learn the truth.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we have seen the harmful nature of Falun Gong, we
will draw a clear line of demarcation with all Falun Gong
organizations and will never participate in any Falun Gong
activities again," one former Falun Gong practitioner said.
</P>
<P>
Many Party members in the central authorities departments said
that while they will undoubtedly keep themselves away from any
Falun Gong practice in according with the CPC Central Committee's
requirements, they will also persuade their family members and
relatives not to believe in or exercise the Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
"The Falun Gong organizations have used extremely evil means to
cheat the public and have caused very serious consequences," said
an angry scholar with the Chinese Academy of Sciences. "The
government must deal a heavy and merciless blow on Falun Gong to
root it out as quickly as possible."
</P>
<P>
In another development, the CPC Central Committee earlier this
week reported its decision to resolve the Falun Gong issue to
China's eight non-Communist parties, the All-China Federation of
Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) and personages without party
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, head of the United Front Work Department of the
CPC Central Committee, was authorized by the Party Central
Committee to deliver the report.
</P>
<P>
"The Falun Gong incident is the most serious political incident
since the June 4 political turbulence in 1989," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
He called on the non-Communist parties, all ACFIC members and
personages without party affiliation to earnestly study and
understand the decision and relevant documents of the CPC Central
Committee, and unify their thinking in accordance with the
guidelines of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to the fact that Falun Gong practitioners also
include members of the non-Communist parties and the ACFIC and
some personages without party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
"We hope you will carry forward your fine tradition of self-
education and help and persuade your members who are also Falun
Gong exercisers to break away from the Falun Gong organizations,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Support Ban on Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Widespread support has been
enunciated for the Chinese government's decision to ban Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
People across the country expressed their firm support for the
series of measures the Communist Party and the government have
taken to ban Falun Gong, saying the step accords with the wish of
the Chinese people and is also conducive to maintaining social
stability and deepening the construction of socialist ethics and
culture.
</P>
<P>
"It's a wise and timely decision to ban Falun Gong, since the
activities of the organizers and some members of Falun Gong are
already jeopardizing social stability and national security." said
Wu Zhongkui, a professor at Beijing Normal University.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guohui, a worker at the Capital Steel Complex, said he
was shocked after watching the TV report on the true nature of Li
Hongzhi, founder of Falun Gong, while Sima Nan, a scholar
researching the abuse of Qigong, described the central government
decision to ban Falun Gong as "a victory of Marxism over pseudo-
science and theism, and a victory of materialism over metaphysics.
"
</P>
<P>
A leading official from the Qigong Society of Shanghai said the
numerous reports that practicing Falun Gong has caused health
problems and deaths indicate that Falun Gong will harm the
practitioners and the country.
</P>
<P>
Li Xinsheng, deputy editor-in-chief of the Qilu Evening News in
east China's Shandong province, said Falun Gong is an illegal
organization with political motives instead of an organization of
Qigong practisers. The newspaper carried three reports exposing
the true nature of Falun Gong between April 1 and 8, which caused
sit-ins and demonstrations organized by Falun Gong leaders, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
Li said a dozen retired workers called him after watching TV
programs exposing the true face of the founder of Falun Gong. "
They said they will never believe Li Hongzhi again, and will
abandon the practice of Falun Gong completely," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists, doctors, and professors in south China's
Guangdong Province said Li Hongzhi deceived his followers by
spreading superstition and taking advantage of their common wish
to keep healthy.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wenjin, the secretary of the Communist Party committee of
Jilin University, said the fight against Falun Gong is an issue
concerning the belief of the members of the Communist Party, and
all the Party members should remain on high alert against Falun
Gong to achieve complete victory.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China's metallurgical industry is
cutting its output and optimizing its product mix in order to
improve its profitability.
</P>
<P>
Pu Haiqing, director of the State Administration of the
Metallurgical Industry, told an on-going national conference that
to support the new strategy the government has offered to increase
tax rebates, curb import, and recently gave permission for turning
debts into equity, to support the metallurgical industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that the production-reduction strategy is aimed at
pushing up the current steel prices by 50 yuan per ton and
enabling the whole industry to make a profit of five billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the industry has made initial success in curbing
production, citing the Wuhan Iron and Steel Works, the Shougang
Corporation and Shanghai Baosteel as examples.
</P>
<P>
Shougang produced 9.61 percent less steel in the first half of
this year than in the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar, South Korea to Enhance Forestry Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and South Korea have agreed
to enhance cooperation in the forestry sector by establishing tree
plantations in Myanmar's central and arid Mandalay division,
official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed here Thursday between the Myanmar
Ministry of Forestry and the Forest Administration of South Korea,
forest plantations will be set up in the Mandalay division's
Nyaung U township with the assistance from the Korea International
Cooperation Agency.
</P>
<P>
In July 1998, Myanmar worked out a three-year project
(1998-2000) to plant trees of 149.8 hectares annually in the
township's Kyubinkwayh Forest Reserve with the help of the Jifpro
Group of Japan and 10 other Japanese organizations.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, Myanmar has been implementing a greening and
environmental program in the arid zone in the central part of the
country, which is aimed at systematic conservation of forests to
maintain sustainable yield of forest products.
</P>
<P>
The greening project was launched in nine districts of the arid
zone in Mandalay, Sagaing and Magway divisions in 1992 and by 1997
more than 16 million trees including teak and hardwood trees had
been planted in areas of over 21,000 hectares, covering 57
townships and 15 mountain ranges.
</P>
<P>
The project was extended to 13 districts after 1997 to cover a
total area of 9.14 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's land area of reserved and protected forest amounts to
more than 104,000 square kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Romania Adheres to "One China" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government Friday
reaffirmed its "one China" policy, saying that the government of
the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government
of China and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
Bogdan Bucur, director of the press office of the Romanian
Foreign Ministry told Xinhua in an interview that Romania will not
have any kind of official links with Taiwan, stressing that this
is the government's long-standing principled stand on the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
Bucur said that the Romanian government is very much concerned
about the remarks made recently by Lee Teng-hui, leader of the
Taiwanese authorities, about Taiwan's status and the subsequent
tension across the Taiwan Straits caused by his separatist remarks.
</P>
<P>
Bucur expressed the hope that cross-straits talks would
continue to avoid any escalation of tension and to maintain peace
and stability in East Asia.

<HEADLINE> Major S. African Banks Cut Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's four major
banks Friday announced a one-percentage-point cut in their prime
overdraft and mortgage interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Standard Bank, First National Bank, ABSA and Nedcor all
announced a decrease in the rates from 17.5 percent to 16.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate cuts, which were expected by economists,
followed a sustained drop in the repo rate -- the rate at which
banks borrow money from the Reserve Bank (the central bank) and a
major barometer of the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts are now predicting that interest rates could
fall to as low as 14 percent by the end of the year. Previous
estimates were 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decrease will be effective from August 2 for most
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
ABSA said its lower mortgage rate would be effective
immediately for new borrowers, whereas First National Bank's new
home loan rate would benefit existing clients from August 16.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The FIFA Confederations Cup
will start Saturday in Mexico and the competition will offer a
challenge for the United States men's team.
</P>
<P>
The tournament, a mini-World Cup, with eight teams from the six
confederations. They include the USA and Mexico, Brazil, Bolivia,
Germany, New Zealand, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The USA expects to do better than in last summer's World Cup,
where it was 0-3 and dealt last.
</P>
<P>
Although this is a quiet year in the world calendar, the team
is enjoying a strong 4-1-1 season with wins against Germany, Chile,
Guatemala and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Making the semifinals won't be easy for the United States. The
USA needs to beat New Zealand on Saturday in Guadalajara because
its next two games get harder. Brazil on Wednesday and Germany on
July 30.
</P>
<P>
Much of the squad that upset Argentina 1-0 last month in
Washington is back, including world-renowned goalkeeper Kasey
Keller. But midfielders Claudio Reyna, Tony Sanneh and Chris Armas
and defenders Eddie Pope and David Regis are missing.
</P>
<P>
Coach Bruce Arena expects more from his usually sound defense
than he got against Argentina. He probably will start defenders
Jeff Agoos, Robin Fraser, Carlos Llamosa and C.J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
The team downed Egypt 4-3 Tuesday. "Obviously, I think we're
underdogs," Fraser says, "But we're capable of playing with anyone
on the right day."

<HEADLINE> Russia Raises Rate of Oil Export Duties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin said Friday that he has signed a resolution raising rate
of the export duty on crude oil by 5 euros per ton to 7.5 euros
per ton.
</P>
<P>
The move was made to make more crude oil available on the
domestic market, Stepashin said a news conference in Yekaterinburg
where he was attending a meeting of the board of the Urals
Economics Association.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the added that proceeds from the duty will be
used to shore up working capital at the oil companies and to
complete the construction of new wells, the Interfax news agency
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The decision came amid reports of a looming crisis of gasoline
shortage blamed on increased exports, lower output in Russian
refineries and rising oil demand on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
By mid-July, gasoline prices have increased in 50 regions of
Russia, of which 13 have experienced a price increase of more than
10 percent.

<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will be the hottest city
in China tomorrow, with its temperature expected to hit 40 degrees
Celsius, according to the Central Meteorological Station.
</P>
<P>
This temperature will be slightly lower than the record of 40.6
degrees Celsius on June 10, 1961. However, Beijing's hot spell is
unusually long this year, because of a lingering massive hot and
dry air mass dominating north China.
</P>
<P>
The dry spell will last several days, shorter than the previous
spell, which lasted from June 24 to July 5, said Tang Huifang,
vice-president of the station.
</P>
<P>
The station also forecast that the highest temperature will be
39 degrees Celsius in Shijiangzhuang and 38 degrees Celsius in
Tianjin, two major cities in north China.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's highest temperature today was 39 degrees Celsius. The
usually teeming streets full of cyclists were almost empty, with
people opting for taxi and subways.
</P>
<P>
Air-conditioners, ice suckers and watermelons are enjoying
brisk sales in the city.

<HEADLINE> Tragic Stories of Falun Gong Practitioners (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Tang Guihua's life was calm and
simple before she began practicing Fa Lun Gong two years ago. But,
one day in 1997, when the farmer was doing a Yoga-style exercise
in her house in Huying Village in east China's Shandong Province,
she felt something unusual.
</P>
<P>
"I heard a person whisper to me that catastrophes were hanging
over the heads of my son and daughter, and the only way to prevent
them was to hammer a nail into my forehead," she told Xinhua after
learning that Falun Gong had been banned by the government on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Without any hesitation, she picked up a nail and tried to
hammer it into her forehead.
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Liu Shunhua, also a Falun Gong practitioner,
rushed her to a hospital immediately. However, Tang refused to
receive any medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
"So I sent her to the psychiatric ward. I spent 2,000 yuan
curing her disease," her husband said, adding that Falun Gong
almost destroyed his family.
</P>
<P>
"I and my wife will no longer practice it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang is lucky compared to Chao Yuzhen, a citizen of
Shijiazhuang, capital of north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
She became involved with Falun Gong in 1995, and soon became
psychopathic. She often told her husband Wang Jianjun that "Master
Li Hongzhi is controlling my mind. We must teach our children to
learn Falun Gong well so that they can become Master Li's
successors."
</P>
<P>
She started practicing at 4:00 am every day and spent all day
reading Li Hongzhi's works. In 1996, she announced that she had
decided to commit suicide. Her husband had to quit his job to take
care of her. However, on April 6, 1997, Chao drowned herself in a
river.
</P>
<P>
She left a note, which read: "The devil Li Hongzhi controls my
mind. He has made me suffer a lot. I can not stand it. It was Li
Hongzhi who urged me not to live any longer."
</P>
<P>
After the death of Chao, Wang Jianjun had to pay off a mountain
of debt he had incurred trying to cure his wife's mental illness.
</P>
<P>
"Falun Gong killed my wife and ruined my family. I hate Li
Hongzhi's guts," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The same tragedy afflicted Zhang Shunxi's family. Zhang is a
worker in a coal mine in Tangshan, Hebei Province, and his wife
Wang Xiuyun was a laid-off cotton spinner.
</P>
<P>
Early last year, a friend told Wang that Falun Gong could cure
her neurasthenia and make her an immortal. So Wang became a
follower of Li Hongzhi.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. Newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Republican-controlled House on Thursday narrowly
approved the largest tax cut since the Reagan era, a 792 billion U.
S. dollar package that would reduce income taxes by 10 percent
over the next decade if Congress makes continued progress in
reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
-- A State Department survey of 161 nations found that about
half of the countries face a medium to high risk of Year 2000
computer breakdowns in their telecommunications, energy and
transportation sectors, which may have an impact on international
trade, the department's inspector general said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The ashes of John F. Kennedy Jr., a reluctant celebrity who
had found snatches of privacy on kayaks and yachts, were committed
to the deep Thursday afternoon during a Roman Catholic ceremony
carried out beyond the reach of long-range television cameras.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Greenspan said the Fed isn't locked into further interest-
rate increases. But financial markets focused on the Fed chairman
's vow to move quickly to stifle any recurrence of inflation,
which rekindled fears of a rate increase. The three big stock
indexes declined, with the Nasdaq dropping 77.33 to 2684.44.
Bonds also fell.
</P>
<P>
-- Aids in Africa killed 1.4 million people in eastern and
southern nations last year, UNICEF said. That means the disease
has passed armed conflict as the No. 1 killer in the area, site of
48 percent of the world's cases.

However, her disease deteriorated after she began practicing
Falun Gong. She lost weight, refused to take medicine, and
suffered from insomnia.
</P>
<P>
When her husband asked her to stop practicing, she answered, "
You know nothing about me. I am on my way to becoming a Buddha."
</P>
<P>
After that, she tried to kill herself several times by various
means. On January 24, 1998, claiming that she could see a lotus
flower throne hovering in the sky, she jumped from the roof of a
four-story building.
</P>
<P>
"I fully support the government's ban on Falun Gong. It was Li
Hongzhi who took my wife's life. He must pay the debt!" said Zhang
Shunxi.
</P>
<P>
Investigations have shown that in Tianjin alone at least eight
people have died as a result of practicing Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Yonggui, section chief of a petrochemical company in
Tianjin, refused to receive medical treatment, believing that
Falun Gong could cure any illness. Even before he died of diabetes
in March this year, he still tried to persuade other people to
believe in Falun Gong because "death is not extinction, but a way
to paradise."
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong also ruins family life. A Chinese Communist Party
member whose family name is Liu has been opposing Falun Gong,
while his wife and children are Falun Gong adherents, who cursed
the husband and father as a "demon". Liu is being forced to
consider divorce.
</P>
<P>
"Falun Gong has sabotaged social and family stability," Liu
said. "We should not let it spread."

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is studying the
advantages and disadvantages associated with the World Trade
Organization (WTO) full membership, the Ministry of Trade and
Industry of Ethiopia said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Trade and Industry Brook Debebe told the press
here that a panel of experts formed last month is expected to
finalize the study and present a conclusive report in a period of
six months.
</P>
<P>
The experts are drawn from, among others, the Ethiopian
Investment Authority, the Ethiopian Quality and Standards
Authority, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Transport
and Communications and the National Bank of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Brook, who chairs the panel, said most African countries are
members of WTO, but their membership has not brought them much
advantage.
</P>
<P>
WTO members make tariff reductions regularly which, in turn,
have affected the industries of certain member African states such
as Kenya and Tanzania, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has enjoyed WTO observer status for the last three
years which has enabled it to get the organization's technical and
financial support, Brook added.

<P>
ZHUHAI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Four men convicted of cross-border
murder and robbery were given death sentences today in this
coastal city in south China's Guangdong Province neighboring Macao.
</P>
<P>
The four criminals, Song Wenhui, Xie Sailong, Dong Chengyu and

Intermediate People's Court and the Xiangzhou District People's
Court announced their sentences in public.
</P>
<P>
Song Wenhui, a native of Jilin City in northeast China's Jilin

<P>
Xie Saihu and Dong Chengyu were sentenced to death for robbery,

<HEADLINE> Non-Communist Parties, Figures Support Falun Gong Ban (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of China's eight non-
Communist parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and
Commerce (ACFIC), as well as some leading personages without party
affiliation, have voiced their support for the nationwide ban on
Falun Gong imposed by the Chinese government Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Founded by Li Hongzhi in 1992, and headed by him, Falun Gong
has widely spread superstitious and heretical ideas and frequently
disrupted social stability in the name of physical fitness
exercises. It was denounced as an "illegal organization" and
formally banned Thursday by the ministries of civil affairs and
public security.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee reported its decision to resolve the Falun Gong issue to
the country's eight non-Communist parties, the ACFIC and
personages without party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
"The Falun Gong incident is the most serious political incident
since the June 4 political turbulence in 1989," said Wang Zhaoguo,
head of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central
Committee, in the report.
</P>
<P>
Wang called on the non-Communist parties, all ACFIC members and
personages without party affiliation to earnestly study and
understand the decision and relevant documents of the CPC Central
Committee, and unify their thinking in accordance with the
guidelines of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to the fact that Falun Gong practitioners also
include members of the non-Communist parties and the ACFIC, and
some personages without party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
"We hope you will carry forward your fine tradition of self-
education and help, and persuade your members who are also Falun
Gong adherents to break away from its organizations," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
After hearing Wang's report, the leaders of the non-Communist
parties and the ACFIC and some leading personages without party
affiliation held a forum in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee has made an absolutely correct and
extremely timely decision in handling the issue of Falun Gong, the
participants agreed.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jieping, chairman of the Central Committee of the Jiu San (
September 3) Society, said that the Falun Gong issue has gradually
become a social problem which can cause enormous harm, and that
with a tight organizational system, the Falun Gong bodies have
turned out to be "subversive organizations with great sabotage
capabilities".
</P>
<P>
"Our struggle against Falun Gong is not only a struggle between
materialism and idealism, but also a serious political struggle,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangying, honorary chairman of the ACFIC, pointed to the
fact that nowadays there are some so-called "masters" who, under
the cover of "scientific research", "carrying forward traditional
national culture" and "promoting health through Qigong exercises",
are actually spreading feudal superstition. They have earned some
people's blind adoration by means of cheating, and Li Hongzhi is
just one of them.
</P>
<P>
"We must take a clear-cut stand in opposing to these people,
and make use of the ideological weapon of Marxist dialectic
materialism and historical materialism to strip the mask from all

<HEADLINE> World's Oldest Giant Panda in Captivity Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Dudu, the world's oldest giant panda
in captivity, died in the zoo in this capital of central China's
Hubei Province yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Dudu, 37, was reported to have been suffering from epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
The hot summer weather in Wuhan, called one of the "furnaces"
of China, may have contributed to her demise, according to the zoo
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The zoo had set up a round-the-clock monitoring team to keep
watch on the state of health of the giant panda and prepared a
range of emergency medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1962 in a nature reserve, Dudu was first transferred to
the Chengdu Zoo, and then moved to Wuhan in 1972.
</P>
<P>
China now has about 1,000 giant pandas, a species under top
state protection, both in captivity and in the wild.
</P>
<P>
The average life span of a giant pandas in the wild is around
15 years, while that of pandas in captivity is around 25 years.
Dudu was a super god of longevity, zoologists say.

<P>
Reacting to a question when the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) will ban Falun Gong, Li Bing, deputy
director of the State Council Information Office, said that the
HKSAR government will have to decide on how to deal with Falun
Gong practitioners there.
</P>
<P>
The central government strictly follows the "one country, two
systems" principle, he said, adding that he believed the HKSAR
government will make its decision in accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
As for Falun Gong's relation to other 'qigong' organizations,
Wu Zhongze, director of the Nongovernmental Organizations
Department under the Ministry of Civil Affairs, said that, in a
socialist country ruled by law, mass organizations have to act in
accordance with the Constitution and laws and that normal qigong
exercises and health-promotion activities are permitted as long as
they observe the law.
</P>
<P>
Wu repeated that the Constitution protects the freedom of
religious belief and normal religious activities and dismissed the
notion that Falun Gong is some kind of religious belief, saying
that it just copies some qigong exercises and religious phrases
pieced together with some superstitious thinking.

Beijing, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army (PLA)
gave its firm support to the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) today in its decision to outlaw Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
The PLA's Headquarters of the General Staff, General Political
Department, General Logistics Department, and General Armaments
Department said that they will carry out the policy decisions of
the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at its core and of the
Central Military Commission and devote themselves to the struggle
against Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
The PLA started a study campaign for all personnel after they
watched TV programs, or listened to broadcasts or read newspapers
about the central government's decision.
</P>
<P>
The PLA told military personnel to take the lead in eliminating
the influences of Falun Gong, to encourage healthy trends and
scientific thought and to maintain social stability.
</P>
<P>
It said that the CPC Central Committee's circular and other
documents from the ministries of civil affairs and public security
have exposed Falun Dafa of Li Hongzhi and Falun Gong, which he
controls.
</P>
<P>
PLA personnel in other parts of the country said they are
determined to support the CPC Central Committee decision on Falun
Gong. They said the decision is the will of the people, the Party,
and the military.
</P>
<P>
The PLA has called for a campaign to study Marxism and to
struggle against idealism, feudal superstitions, and
pseudoscientific ideas in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
The four PLA departments said that their retired officers also
studied the CPC Central Committee's circular that forbids Party
members from practicing Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
The retired army officers were reported as saying that they
will study dialectical materialism and historical materialism as
well as scientific theories, while taking an active part in the
struggle against actions that harm China's reforms, development,
stability, the socialist system and Party leadership.

It makes every effort to support "Taiwan independence" forces
and attempts to put obstacles in the path of China's peaceful
reunification, the Committee said.
</P>
<P>
The amendment, put forward by Robert Andrews, demands that "the
U.S. president seek a public renunciation by China of any use of
force or threat to use force against Taiwan," and says that "the U.
S. should help Taiwan defend itself in case of threats or a

<TEXT>
<P>
Lee made his "two states" remarks on July 9th in an attempt to
negate the "one China" policy and to separate China. In betraying
the nation and using Taiwan compatriots as the stakes, Lee Teng-
hui wantonly decided to call cross-straits relations "state-to-
state" and took a very dangerous step on the pathway of dividing
the country.
</P>
<P>
This act has exposed entirely his determination to separate
Chinese sovereignty and territory and to separate Taiwan from
China.
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows that there is only one China in the world, the
government of the People's Republic of China is the only
legitimate government representing the whole of China, that Taiwan
is an inseparable part of the Chinese territory, that this is an
indisputable fact, and that the U.S. government has made a clear
commitment to the issue in all three Sino-U.S. joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui's remarks and attempts to separate China received
strong condemnation by all Chinese including the Taiwan
compatriots and by people of Chinese origin in other parts of the

China will in no way sit idly by if some people work for "

<P>
The Committee says that the Taiwan issue concerns China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, its great cause of peaceful
reunification and the national pride of the Chinese people. It
also says that the Taiwan issue has always been the most important

urges the U.S. Congress and congressmen to put the overall
situation of Sino-U.S. relations above everything else and
strictly observe the principles stated in the three joint

<P>
The Committee says they should also follow the "three-no"

"one China, one Taiwan" policy, or Taiwanese membership in any
international organization where statehood is required.
</P>
<P>
The Committee is asking the U.S. Congress and congressmen not

The water levels along 929 km. of embankments are still
perilously high, according to local officials.

<HEADLINE> Third Yangtze Flood Crest Pressing Towards Central China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua)-- The third flood crest is estimated
to reach Hankou on the middle reaches of Yangtze river in Central
China's Hubei Province at eight this evening, according to an
expert at the Ministry of Water Resources.
</P>

At eight pm, the flood waters will possibly be 28.9 m, four cm
higher than at eight am.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Denies Confiscating Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has not
confiscated copies of newspapers critical to the administration,
including the last issue of The Manila Times, Press Secretary
Rodolfo Reyes said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Reyes dismissed speculations that the
government could be behind the move to confiscate the last issue
of The Manila Times which pinned the blame on the government for
the closure of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, The Manila Times publisher Ermin Garcia told
the media that copies of The Manila Times have been confiscated by
policemen in Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
However, an initial check conducted by some reporters showed
that the newsstands ran out of supply of the newspaper due to the
high demand for the last issue of The Manila Times, which has been
considered a collectors' item.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said no one in the government is going to order the
confiscation of newspapers. "If ever anyone would do that, it
would be someone pretending to be from the government," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the government stands to gain nothing out of the
confiscation of the newspaper, but more criticisms.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Times, one of the country's oldest English dailies,
has been sold by the Gokongwei family to real estate developer
Reghis Romero II.
</P>
<P>
The deal was sealed Wednesday amid a cloud of doubt on the real
identities of the new owners because presidential adviser Mark
Jimenez was figured in earlier talks with the Gokongweis.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada filed a 101-million-peso
(2.5-million U.S. dollars) libel suit in March against the
newspaper after a story of the newspaper involved him in an
irregular hydro-electric project deal.
</P>
<P>
Estrada dropped the suit in April after Robina Gokongwei-Pe,
president of the newspaper, issued a personal apology to him.

<HEADLINE> Communist Youth League Members Told Not To Practice Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Youth League of
China has forbidden its members from practicing Falun Dafa, also
called Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
A circular from the Central Committee of the league says that
for a time the Falun Gong organization has spread in some
localities and a few league members have practiced Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
As the Ministry of Civil Affairs has banned the Research
Society of Falun Dafa and the Falun Gong organization under its
control after deeming them to be illegal, Communist Youth League
members should see clearly the political nature of Falun Gong and
the harm it has caused, and must not practice it, the circular
says.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Youth League is a mass organization of the
advanced youth led by the Communist Party, an assistant to and the
reserve force of the Communist Party and its members must firmly
believe in Marxism, the circular says.
</P>
<P>
The circular asks the Communist Youth League committees at
various levels to help their members understand that practicing
Falun Dafa runs contrary to the nature and purpose of the League.
</P>
<P>
The circular says that there needs to be an education drive
against Falun Gong so that Communist Youth League members will
receive a lesson in Marxist materialism and atheism and increase
their political insight and capability to tell right from wrong.
</P>
<P>
The circular asks the leagues committees at various levels to
help members who practice Falun Gong change their attitude and to
break ties with the Falun Gong organization.
</P>
<P>
For League members who practiced Falun Gong, but break their
ties with the Falun Gong organization voluntarily, no questions
will be asked, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
Members who have been involved in organizing and spreading
Falun Gong ideas will not be investigated or held responsible if
they break ties with the organization on their own and expose the
problems of Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
League members who are key members of Falun Gong and have
committed serious mistakes will be subject to disciplinary action,
the circular says. But those who repent or render meritorious
services will have their punishment reduced or will not be
investigated.
</P>
<P>
Those who refuse to correct their mistakes after repeated
education will be asked to give up their league membership, and
those who refuse to do so voluntarily will be expelled from the
league, the circular says.
</P>
<P>
A very few behind-the-scenes plotters and organizers who
intentionally caused disturbances with political motives should be
resolutely cleared out of the league, according to the circular.

<HEADLINE> Documents Signed to Provide Japanese Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China and Japan signed three
government documents here today that will allow Japan to provide
more than 2.385 billion Japanese yen in economic aid to China's
ethnic minority regions.
</P>
<P>
The three documents were signed by Long Yongtu, chief
negotiator of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), and Yuji Miyamoto, minister of the Japanese
embassy in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government will provide teaching instruments worth
568 million yen to several middle schools in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Qinghai Province, and
northeast China's Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the aid is to improve the teaching in areas where
ethnic minority people live, and in turn help develop the economy
in those areas, according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Japanese government will provide 1.817 billion
yen-worth of medical equipment to the People's Hospital of the
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and hospitals in the Puyi and Miao
Ethnic Minorities Autonomous Prefecture in southwest China's
Guizhou Province to improve the medical conditions of those
regions, according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government's gratis aid added up to six billion
yen last year. The total Japanese aid to China reached about 107.7
billion yen between 1981 and 1998, and was mainly invested in
agricultural, educational, medical and environmental protection
projects, according to MOFTEC officials.

<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A leading official of the

Party of China (CPC) said here today that it is now necessary and
timely to deal with the problem of Falun Gong in China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters from the People's Daily, the
official said that the central government's decision to deal with
Falun Gong represents the will of the whole Party and all of the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The move conforms to the fundamental interests of the Chinese
people of all nationalities, and it will facilitate the favorable
situation of maintaining stability and unity, China's reforms,
opening up and modernization, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the malicious fallacies spread by Li Hongzhi and
his Falun Gong organization deceived some people, caused
disturbances and undermined stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that the struggle against Falun Gong is a serious
political and ideological struggle.
</P>
<P>
He called for a comprehensive publicity campaign to be launched
on the central government's policies toward Falun Gong, aiming to
unite and educate the overwhelming majority of the practitioners,
and extricate them from Falun Gong's malicious fallacies.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is important to differentiate those who
practice keep-fit exercises from those who spread superstition and
ordinary Falun Gong practitioners from a handful plotters and
organizers of illegal activities, and to make a distinction
between genuine religious beliefs and legal religious activities
from Falun Gong organizations.

<HEADLINE> Civil Servants Forbidden to Practice Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Personnel
today made public a circular forbidding government civil servants
to practice Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
The circular said that in the past years, a small number of
civil servants have been practicing Falun Dafa, concocted by Li
Hongzhi, and some of them even participated in illegal gatherings
under the pretext of "spreading the Falun Dafa," which disturbed
social order.
</P>
<P>
"These activities violate the discipline regarding civil
servants, damage the image of civil servants, harm the national
and the people's interests, and have had a bad impact on society
and should be stopped firmly," said the circular.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs Thursday announced that
it decided to ban the Research Society of Falun Dafa and the Falun
Gong organizations under its control since it deemed them to be
illegal. The Ministry of Public Security Thursday also issued a
notice prohibiting all activities in support of Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the "Circular of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) on Forbidding Party Members to
Practice Falun Dafa (Falun Gong)" and "Provisional Regulations on
Government Civil Servants," the Personnel Ministry's circular
called on civil servants to take a clear-cut stand in opposing the
malicious fallacies advocated by Falun Dafa.
</P>
<P>
Civil servants should strictly abide by discipline and
earnestly follow the Provisional Regulations on Government Civil
Servants, and are not allowed to practice Falun Dafa, the circular
said.
</P>
<P>
The circular also called for enhanced management of incumbent
and retired civil servants.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua)-- China increased the number of
overseas contracts and labor services in the first six months,
mainly in Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, China clinched 8,782 new contracts for overseas
projects and labor services, worth 5.83 billion U.S. dollars in
contractual value during this period, about three percent more
than for the same last year period.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover of overseas contracted projects and labor
services amounted to 4.52 billion dollars worth in the first half
of this year, up 11 percent over the same period last year. By the
end of June, 338,000 Chinese were working abroad, 14,000 more than
last year.
</P>

The value of projects and labor services in Europe increased 31.
3 percent and in North America, 156 percent. During the period,
the turnover from large projects in Africa jumped 70.4 percent.
</P>

One reason for the increase, analysts say, is the rise in the
number of large-scale projects and the use of technology.
</P>
<P>
During the January-June period, there were 48 projects costing
20 million dollars or more, 10 more than for the same last year
period, which is important for exports of Chinese equipment and

<HEADLINE> WTO Seminar Helps Officials, Entrepreneurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Local trade and economic officials
and entrepreneurs from all across China said here Friday they have
cleared up misunderstandings on China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) following the conclusion of a five-day WTO
seminar.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which started Monday, attracted more than 150
officials and businessmen. They were briefed on China's 13-year
bid to enter the multilateral trade body, the nature and rules of
the WTO and the strategy China should take following its entry.
</P>
<P>
"I have become fully aware of the urgency of China's entry into
the WTO," said a businessman from east China's Shandong Province
at the conclusion ceremony of the seminar. "My confidence in China
's future has also grown. The seminar also provided some useful
insights for the development strategy of our company," he added.
</P>
<P>
Launched by the WTO Research Institute of the Beijing-based
University of International Business and Economics, the seminar is
the second of its kind to be held this year. More such seminars
will be held later this year, said a spokesman for the Institute.
</P>
<P>
Xu Bingjin, assistant minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation (MOFTEC), said that such seminars are needed because
there are some misunderstandings about China's WTO entry.
</P>
<P>
"Due to a lack of basic knowledge about the WTO and the
negotiations on China's WTO entry, there have been some
misunderstandings," he said at Friday's ceremony. "Seminars such
as this one help to clarify the issues."
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, MOFTEC's chief representative at the WTO entry
negotiations, and leading Chinese economists like Li Yining and
Liu Ji, were among those who lectured at the seminar.

During the period, overseas projects meant exports of 387
million dollars worth of Chinese equipment and materials.
</P>
<P>
The MOFTEC earlier this year had taken measures to promote the
development of overseas projects by: speeding up the licensing of
qualified enterprises, corporations, and design institutes;
cultivating markets in East and Southeast Asia; developing the
African and Latin American markets; rebuilding markets in the
Middle East; and cultivating markets in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
China began its overseas contracts and labor services in 1978.
MOFTEC Minister Shi Guangsheng has pointed out that China's
overseas contracts now only account for one to two percent of the
global contracts and its labor services only account for one
percent of the global migrant labor force. So there is great
development potential.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Looking for New Palm Oil Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia, the world's largest
palm oil exporter, is making efforts to look for new markets and
is eyeing non-traditional markets like Russia, Iran, Iraq,
Vietnam, Sudan and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The strategy to penetrate non-traditional markets is spurred by
the rising palm oil production, according to Mohd Yusof Hashim,
chief executive officer of the Malaysian Palm Oil Promotion
Council (MPOPC), a body set up as the promotion arm for the local
palm oil industry.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to produce more, so we need to sell more and
expand our markets," Malaysia's national news agency Bernama
Friday quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
MPOPC, which spends 15 million ringgit (3.94 million U.S.
dollars) and 16 million ringgit (4.21 million U.S. dollars)
annually on promotion programs, is working through its nine
overseas offices to assist the country's penetration into
non-traditional markets, Yusof said.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate its expansion to non-traditional markets,
Malaysia is considering providing palm oil credit payment
arrangements to countries like the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea, Sudan, Iran and Cuba for the purchase of the country's palm
oil, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is expected to produce about 9.5 million tons of palm
oil this year due to the favorable climate against 8.3 million
tons in 1998. Malaysia accounted for about 68 percent of the world
palm oil exports in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has secured the markets in 110 countries and regions
to date and its major palm oil markets include China, India and
Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Afghanistan to Face Acute Food Shortage: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Friday
predicted a food shortage of 1.13 million tons in the year 2000 in
war-torn Afghanistan because of unfavorable weather this year.
</P>
<P>
Mike Sockett of the World Food Program (WFP) and Bary Stride of
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) told a weekly press
briefing here that the shortage will be the most serious in
several years.
</P>
<P>
A field study by the WFP and FAO showed that wheat production
fell both in irrigated and rain-fed areas because of the dry
weather in Afghanistan this year with snowfall being the lowest in
40 years.
</P>
<P>
Sockett said Afghan traders are expected to import a total of
800,000 tons of wheat while the WFP plans to supply 206,000 tons
to meet the shortage.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has 97,000 tons of wheat in the pipeline for 1999 and
would require 45 million dollars in donations to arrange the
remaining 109,000 tons of wheat, according to Sockett.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Stride said that the opium crop takes the
best-irrigated lands in Afghanistan. The U.N. experts believe that
poppy was grown on an area of more than 63,000 hectares in 1988.
</P>
<P>
About 85 percent of Afghanistan's estimated 21 million people
depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Only about 12 percent
of the total land are arable, and 3 percent are under forest
cover, 46 percent are permanent pastures, while the rest 39
percent are mountainous.
</P>
<P>
Due to unfavorable weather, production of wheat in Afghanistan
this year is expected to fall by about 12 percent and that of all
cereal crops by 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sockett said that the WFP and its partners in Afghanistan will
keep the situation under continuos review and will appeal for
additional resources should they be needed.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Suspends Bridge Construction for Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The construction of a bridge
over the Mekong River was suspended Thursday by the Cambodian
government for its lack of safety control.
</P>
<P>
So far, two workers have been killed and several others injured
since the operation started early this year.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, being built by a Japanese company, is the biggest
project in Cambodia under Japanese grand aid, worth a total of
nearly 56 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the government has stopped a Japanese
company from its work because of their neglect of the safety of
the workers, according to an official of the Ministry of Public
Works and Transportation.
</P>
<P>
He added the ban was imposed at the request of the Japanese
Embassy to Cambodia and the Japan International Cooperation
Agency, but it is a temporary stop, which would be revoked when
the company improved its administration.
</P>
<P>
The bridge is going to be the first one across the Mekong River
in Cambodia. The construction will be completed in March 2002.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Former Indonesian President
Soeharto's condition has improved and he is now able to
communicate, said Sudjono Martoatmojo, head of the Pertamina
Hospital where Soeharto is being treated for mild stroke, Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sudjono said the medical team looking after Soeharto has been
conducting intensive physiotherapy, focusing on his ability to
speak.
</P>
<P>
The former president's hands and legs could move normally, he
told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
Sudjono denied reports that Soeharto was in a coma when he was
rushed to the hospital on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There had been an obstruction in a blood vessel in his brain
and not in the cerebellum, he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked how long Soeharto would have to stay in hospital, Sudjono
said it is expected that he could return home in no more than two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Normally, a patient of mild stroke has to stay in hospital for
two weeks, he said, adding that it would take about three months
for Soeharto's speech to become normal again.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to resign from his presidential position on
May 21 last year after 32 years in power.

<HEADLINE> Stepashin Pledges No Second War in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin said Friday that his country will not launch another war
in the republic of Chechnya but everything must be done to stop
hostage taking in the region.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no war in Chechnya, nobody wants to repeat the
mistake twice," Stepashin told a press conference in Yekaterinburg,
a city 1,470 kilometers southeast of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He said efforts are continuing to prepare a meeting between
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kidnapping has plagued Chechnya and the neighboring Russian
regions of Stavropol and Daghestan. More than 700 people,
including Russian Interior Ministry's envoy to Chechnya, Gennady
Shpigun, were taken hostage this year alone.
</P>
<P>
"Everything must be done to stop hostage taking in Chechnya,
Stavropol region and Daghestan," Stepashin, who used to be the
interior minister, stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya's separatists declared the republic an independent
state in 1991 and Russian troops launched an attack on the
separatists in 1994. Fighting continued into 1996.
</P>
<P>
In August 1996, Chechen rebel leaders signed a broad agreement
with the Russian government for ending the war. The agreement
called for the immediate withdrawal of Russian forces and the
postponement of a decision on Chechnya's political status until
December 2001.

<HEADLINE> China Properly Deals with Falun Gong Practitioners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Government departments are taking
measures to properly accommodate Falun Gong practitioners who had
gathered in Beijing in the past few days, a government spokesman
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Some practitioners from outside Beijing will be sent back home
after having a break or food at temporary places that were
arranged for those from afar, said Li Bing, deputy director of the
Information Office under the State Council, in response to a
question raised at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said there had been some Falun Gong practitioners coming to
Beijing recently, mostly from Hebei and Liaoning provinces. Words
were running among them that Li Hongzhi, founder of Falun Gong,
let them gather around Zhongnanhai or other places in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Because the majority of the practitioners had been deceived
into coming for the gathering, related government departments
explained the truth to them and dissuaded them from gathering.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Urges End to Media Bickering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin on Friday urged two of the country's largest television
stations to make peace rather than "discredit Russia" by attacking
each other.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin repeated his dissatisfaction over the information
war unleashed by the ORT and NTV national television channels, run
respectively by media tycoons Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir
Gusinsky.
</P>
<P>
The ORT attacks started last week when the channel claimed NTV
was hopelessly in debt. NTV fought back, accusing Berezovsky of
crony-capitalism politics that threatened to turn Russia into a "
banana republic."
</P>
<P>
"I feel ashamed for the information war of the recent days,
not even a war but rather a vulgar informational squabble,"
Stepashin said in an interview with the Vek newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's airwave or newspaper pages are often
turned to a disgraceful feud, a war of personal, basically
mercantile, interests, and that "journalists are used as
gladiators, warping the souls and the hearts of television viewers,
radio listeners and readers."
</P>
<P>
"The high degree of the freedom of information, the
unconditional right to its distribution implies a high degree of
responsibility," the prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Says Falun Gong Ban Follows Chinese Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here today that the decision to outlaw the Falun Dafa Research
Society and Falun Gong is in line with Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
Li Baoku, a vice-minister of civil affairs, told a State
Council Information Office press conference that the Regulations
on Registering and Managing Mass Organizations state that mass
organizations have to register, must abide by China's constitution,
laws, regulations and policies, and should not violate the
fundamental principles of the constitution or jeopardize the
interests of the nation and people or of other organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Falun Dafa Research Society and the Falun
Gong are well-organized but that the Society, which was founded by
Li Hongzhi, had not got the approval of government departments and
was not registered, and was, therefore, illegal.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Falun Gong has fooled many of its
practitioners, getting them to attack Party, government and media
offices in many parts of the country. On April 25, Falun Gong got
a large number of followers to gather outside Zhongnanhai, the
Communist Party of China headquarters compound.

<P>
After the April 25 incident, government departments managed to
educate Falun Gong practitioners better but the plotters of Falun
Gong organizations and some behind-the-scenes figures refused to
stop their illegal activities and even intensified them by
spreading fallacies and creating disturbances, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Some key members spread the heretical ideas and do not allow
other people to express more well-founded opinions when they
disagree with them, he said.
</P>
<P>
They even stir up trouble among some practitioners and put them
up to gathering around government offices, he said, pointing out
that Li Hongzhi makes practitioners obey his instructions
absolutely and they can follow no other belief or theory and he
controls them psychologically.
</P>
<P>
His heretical ideas contradict modern science, modern
civilization, and state ethics, and Falun Dafa and Falun Gong have
had a grave negative impact on society, the official said, adding
that many people have exposed the dark side of Falun Gong and have
appealed to the government to take legal action against the
organization. So, the government ban on the Falun Dafa Research
Society and Falun Gong is the will of the people and has broad
support from the people.

<HEADLINE> Indian Software Export to Grow 53 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- India's software exports are
expected to grow by 53 percent during the current fiscal year to
cross the 160 billion Indian rupee (3.85 billion U.S. dollars)
mark, the National Association of Software and Service Companies
said.
</P>
<P>
"Continuing the growth trend of over 50 percent per annum since
1990-91, software exports from the country are projected to touch
167 billion Indian rupees (4.02 billion dollars) this year," the
association's President Dewang Mehta said in Mumbai Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Software exports touched 109.4 billion Indian rupees (2.7
billion dollars) during 1998-99, recording a growth of 68 percent
in rupee terms (56 percent in dollar terms) over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Mehta also projected that software exports would grow at a
compounded annual growth rate of 70 percent from the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
He added that even according to conservative estimates, this
was expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of more
than 50 percent over the next 10 years on the back of established
skill levels of Indian software engineers worldwide.

The official said that the "Truthfulness, Benevolence and
Tolerance" advocated by Li Hongzhi is meant to misguide and
deceive the people. Li Hongzhi changed his date of birth to
coincide with the birthday of Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism,
to pretend that he is a reincarnation of Sakyamuni and he provided
an array of false data like that about having studied Buddhism
since childhood.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi caused fear among practitioners and some lost their
sense of right and wrong and became ill or died. Some even killed
relatives.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi and his organization could not tolerate criticism or
alternative views and what he did proves that he is neither
truthful nor benevolent and tolerant, the official said.
</P>
<P>
For ordinary Falun Gong practitioners, he said, they will not
be penalized if they break their ties with Falun Gong
organizations and do not participate in Falun Gong activities.
</P>
<P>
He added that most Falun Gong practitioners are victims of
Falun Gong and that the major task now is to educate them.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, those who plot and organize disturbances will
be dealt with in accordance with the law.

<P>
TOKYO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A knife-wielding Japanese young man
hijacked an All Nippon Airways (ANA) jumbo jet bound for New
Chitose airport in Japan's northernmost prefecture Hokkaido on
Friday, but was subdued aboard the plane about one hour later,
Japanese government officials said.
</P>
<P>
The hijacked plane with 517 passengers and crew members
returned to Tokyo's Haneda airport later, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
None of the 503 passengers were hurt in the incident, but the
pilot of the hijacked plane died from injuries sustained while
subduing the hijacker.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old unemployed man was arrested after the hijacked
plane returned to Haneda airport at 12:14 p.m. (local time), Tokyo
police said.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo police said they received a hijack signal from the plane
at around 11:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The male hijacker, armed with a 20-centimeter knife, forced the
copilot out of the cockpit and demanded to be taken to the U.S.
Yokota Air Base in western Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The man told investigators he likes to play flight simulation
games and wanted to fly a real plane, police said.
</P>
<P>
ANA flight 61 left Haneda at 11:23 a.m. and was scheduled to
arrive at New Chitose airport near Sapporo, capital of Hokkaido,
around 12:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government established a special headquarters to
gather information and deal with the incident soon after the
hijacking occurred.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan's Transport Ministry ordered airports
nationwide to step up the detection level of metal detectors to
prevent a recurrence of such incidents. Enditm

<P>
MOSCOW, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires continued to spread
in Russia's Far Eastern region of Khabarovsk despite rain, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fires have engulfed another 7,000 hectares over the past 24
hours, bringing the total area of taiga in fire to 44,000
hectares, Tass said, quoting Vladimir Mukovaz of the Far Eastern
anti-fire air service.

<P>
Fortunately, rain did help to localize 30 fires and eliminate
another 17 in the region that declared a state of emergency last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mukovoz described the situation as "extremely difficult,"
saying over 1,200 fire fighters and emergency workers are fighting
the blazes to protect villages and enterprises. The Federal
Forest Service is sending reinforcements to Khabarovsk from other
the parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Ishayev, head of the Khabarovsk territorial
administration, has instructed local leaders to take exhaustive
measures to combat fires and ordered the use of technical
equipment and personnel from all enterprises and organizations
irrespective of their organizational and legal status.
</P>
<P>
Stocks of food, fuel and lubricants and other property are
being prepared as part of the fire fighting measures.
</P>
<P>
A temporary ban has also been imposed on trips and excursions
to forests. Motor vehicles would need a special permit to enter
forest zones.

(AMM) that he was directed to inform the AMM of his government's
decision to "reaffirm its commitment to the 'one China' policy
which successive governments have pursued since independence."
</P>
<P>
Following a review of the previous government's decision to
establish "diplomatic ties" with Taiwan, Eri said, Prime Minister
Morauta announced on July 21 that PNG's "long-standing 'one China'
policy of maintaining state-to-state relations with the People's
Republic of China remains intact."
</P>
<P>
Morauta was elected PNG's new prime minister on July 14 by an
overwhelming majority of 99 to five in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
PNG has been a special observer at the annual AMM since 1981.
Eri, PNG's ambassador to Indonesia, said the new government's
foreign minister was yet to be appointed, so Morauta named him as
the prime minister's special envoy to the AMM in Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Urged to Sell off Gold Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese leading banker has
called on the Central Bank to sell off its gold reserves to clear
public debt in view of the falling gold prices in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
"A drastic situation requires drastic measures, and the only
way to solve the issue of public debt is to sell the gold
reserves," Francois Bassil, Chairman of the country's biggest bank
Byblos Bank, was quoted by the Daily Star Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why we should sit on the reserves while the
prices of gold is falling," Bassil said.
</P>
<P>
The price of gold slid to a 20-year-low of around 250
U.S. dollars an ounce after the Bank of England announced its
attention of selling 25 tons of its gold reserves a few months
ago.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the value of the Lebanese Central Bank's 9.2 tons
of gold fell to 2.4 billion dollars from 3.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Salim Hoss assured Parliament last week that
the government had no intention of selling its gold reserves now
or in the future.
</P>
<P>
The banker said the money generated from selling off gold
reserves could be deposited in international banks as collateral
to obtain long-term foreign currency loans at low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He called on the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund to persuade the Lebanese government to sell its gold.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is struggling to curb huge budget deficit and public
debt by cutting down expenditures and raising taxes.

JERUSALEM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's chief of staff, Danny

Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States has made clear to Israel that it views
implementation of the Wye accord, including the planned pullbacks
in the West Bank, as the top priority on the road to renewing the
peace process. The U.S. administration has therefore decided to
slow down its moves on the Syrian track, and President Bill
Clinton has delayed his planned phone conversation with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Sources in the prime minister's office said during his
talks with Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat
Saturday, Barak will try to ease the fear of the Palestinians

sources estimated that Barak might suggest a big and qualitative
second withdrawal in exchange for Palestinian agreement to combine
the final phase of the Wye with the final-status talks.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Ruling Party Official Accused as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- National Secretary of the ruling
Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD), Michael Sata, said here
Thursday that MMD chairperson for women's affairs Princess
Nakatindi Wina is a member of the opposition United Party for
National Development (UPND).
</P>
<P>
But MMD National Chairman, Nakatindi's husband Sikota Wina,
denied the allegations saying his wife is still a staunch member
of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Friday quoted Sata, who is minister without
portfolio, as saying that Nakatindi's recent utterances and
actions are enough evidence to show that she is no longer a MMD
member.
</P>
<P>
Nakatindi allegedly organized the July 17 demonstration at the
Mass Media Complex in Lusaka where she paraded UPND youths.
</P>
<P>
She is also among other things alleged to have allowed UPND
cards to be sold at her farm house where demonstrators were
addressed and feted.
</P>
<P>
Sata said "so Princess Nakatindi is not MMD at all because she
is selling UPND cards, and organizing demonstrations with UPND
members. I doubt her morality and integrity. She is already gone
to UPND. She is no longer in MMD."
</P>
<P>
Wina challenged Sata to cite anyone who had bought a card from
their farm where the alleged meeting with demonstrators never took
place.
</P>
<P>
"They made the biggest blunder to imprison her on trumped up
charges and now she is haunting them. Her position in Kanyama
needs no explanation. She stood for second term and won," Wina
said.
</P>
<P>
Nakatindi is the member of parliament of Kanyama, a township of
Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Early 1998, Nakatindi, sole senior MMD official detained in
connection with the foiled coup of October 28, 1997, were charged
together with 77 army solders with treason. She was granted
constitutional bail in December last year together with an
opposition leader since "no evidence has been offered against the
two accused persons."

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Official on Falun Gong Prohibition (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The official went on to say that the emergence of the Falun
Gong issue has "a complicated international and domestic backdrop.
"
</P>
<P>
"China's feudal society lasted for a quite long time, and the
remnants of the decayed ideology of feudalism has not been wiped
out," explained the official. "It will stage a comeback and poison
the people's minds whenever there is an 'appropriate climate'."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, hostile forces in the Western countries have
never stopped trying to "Westernize" and disintegrate China, and
have constantly pursued ideological and cultural infiltration
against China.
</P>
<P>
"Under such circumstances, the ideological and political work
in some places and departments has failed to meet the challenge of
the new situation, and appeared weak, while some Party members
have neglected study and the reform of their world outlooks and
have allowed their faith in communist ideal to waver," the
official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Party organizations at all levels must draw a lesson from the
Falun Gong issue, take concrete measures to strengthen and improve
their education and the management of the Party members, and
adhere to the principle of being strict with all Party members, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to carry out education in Marxist materialism
and atheism among the broad masses of the Party members in an
extensive and profound manner, so as to help them constantly
enhance their Party spirit and capacity to differentiate right
from wrong," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In order to strengthen the management of the Party members, the
official said, all Party organizations must be run in strict
accordance with the Party Constitution and other Party rules and
regulations, and backsliding Party members must be dealt with in
accordance with Party discipline.
</P>
<P>
"All Party comrades must rally closely around the Party Central
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, and strive hard
for the advancement of the great cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics," the official urged.

<TEXT>
<P>
The official pointed to the fact that the so-called "
truthfulness, Benevolence and tolerance" doctrine of Li Hongzhi's
Falun Dafa is something highly deceptive, which has helped Li to
cheat and confuse a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
"However, if we take a close look at Li's evil deeds in recent
years, it won't be hard for us to see through his hypocritical
mask," noted the official.
</P>
<P>
Li always told Falun Gong practitioners not to go to hospitals
or take medicine for their ailments, as illness is caused by one's
"evil debts" accumulated in the past and can only be cured through
Falun Gong practice. Some people who believed his fallacies lost
their lives because they failed to get medical treatment. Some
people have committed suicide or lost their sanity after
practicing Falun Dafa. Li also frequently instigated his followers
to harass, intimidate and even besiege individuals and departments
that criticized Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
"Where in the aforementioned facts can we find the 'benevolence
' and 'tolerance' Li often preaches?" asked the official.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the ethical improvement and self-
cultivation pursued by Communist Party members must be achieved
through constantly reforming their subjective worlds, adhering to
the principle of seeking truth from facts, pursuing truth and
serving the people wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, what we strive for and Li Hongzhi's wanton claim
that a person should 'upgrade' himself or herself to become a '
Buddha', 'God' or other supreme being through Falun Gong exercises
are poles apart," the official stressed.
</P>
<P>
Citing relevant articles in the Party Constitution, the
official said that it is a requirement of Communist Party
discipline that a Party member should not become involved in
practices such as those of Falun Dafa.
</P>
<P>
"If a Communist Party member practices Falun Dafa and believes
Li's malicious fallacies, he has completely betrayed the Party's
fundamental theories, line and creed, and has also violated the
Party's political discipline," he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, many Party members who once
practiced Falun Dafa or participated in illegal gatherings of
Falun practitioners have now voluntarily broken away from the
Falun Gong organization. "This reflects their enhanced political
awareness," he praised.
</P>
<P>
Those extremely few Party members who, despite repeated
persuasion and help from the government and the Party, keep on
practicing Falun Gong and go so far as to participate in the
organization's illegal gatherings aimed at disturbing social
stability, will be severely punished according to Party discipline
and laws of the state, he warned.

<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Communist Party of China
(CPC) official today made a speech, in which he declared that
Party members are prohibited from participating in the activities
of Falun Gong, an illegal organization founded by Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
The official, in charge of the Organization Department of the
CPC Central Committee, pointed out that the CPC has launched an
education campaign within the Party to tackle the Falun Gong
problem.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important decision of the CPC Central Committee,
and it is of great significance fort the building of the Party,
the enhancement of the cohesive and combat strength of the Party,
and the maintenance of China's reform, development and stability,"
he remarked.
</P>
<P>
The official called on Party organizations at all levels and
all Party members to study and implement the Party's recent
circular on Falun Gong, and conscientiously engage in the
education campaign.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Falun Gong groups have mushroomed
across the country in recent years, and some Party members have
joined Falun Gong groups and believe in the doctrine of Falun Dafa,
a superstitious fabrication of Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
Some behind-the-scenes figures plotted, instigated, and misled
a certain number of Falun Gong practitioners to illegally besiege
and attack Party and government institutions, as well as media
units. Even some Party members took part in those activities,
which violated the Party's discipline, tarnished the image of the
Party and resulted in severe consequences.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Civil Affairs announced on Thursday that the
Research Society of Falun Dafa and the Falun Gong organization
under its control are illegal, and the Ministry of Public Security
also issued a notice prohibiting all activities in support of
Falun Gong.

<HEADLINE> China's Consumer Confidence Continues to Rise (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese consumers' confidence in
the economy continued to rise in June, as the Index of Consumer
Expectation (ICE) surged back to a higher level than at the
beginning of the year under the impact of a buoyant stock market.
</P>
<P>
However, consumers still hold a prudent view of the long-term
economic situation for the next five years, expressing concerns
about future employment and income potential.
</P>
<P>
The China Business Climate Monitoring Center under the National
Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in its June report released today said
that the ICE rose by 0.4 points over May to 94.1 points, nearly
one point higher than in January.
</P>
<P>
The report also shows that the other consumer-confidence
indices, the Index of Current Consumer Economic Conditions (ICC)
and the Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS), both registered overall
growth over the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are optimistic about the economy's strength for the
next 12 months, with the percentage of people expecting a better
economic performance rising by 1.7 points over May, while the
proportion of people expecting a worsening economy dropped by 0.7
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Some 45.2 percent of those surveyed said the economy will be
better in the next 12 months, while only 9.1 percent expect a
downturn, and fewer people are uncertain about the economy in the
short term.
</P>
<P>
However, the proportion of people who are optimistic about the
economy for the five years grew by only one percentage point to 44.
6 percent, while that of people who are pessimistic grew at the
faster rate of 1.7 percentage points to 14.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
An NBS official said that the people's caution about economic
performance in the long term can be attributed to four factors.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United chairman
Martin Edwards repeated here that he sees no possibility of the
team attending next season's F.A. Cup on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United, the remarkable treble of England last season,
have declared to withdraw from this season's F.A. Cup to play in
the inaugural World Club Championship to be held in Brazil in
January.
</P>
<P>
The decision has aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the
team's fans and has led to accusations United have not valued the
F.A. Cup.
</P>
<P>
Edwards told reporters that there was no possibility the
decision would be changed because of fixture congestion.
</P>
<P>
Edwards also said they were to play in the World Club
Championship neither for brand-building, nor for financial reasons,
but purely to try to help England's bid for the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United are in Hong Kong, China, to play the South
China Club on Saturday. It's the final match of their Asian tour.

<HEADLINE> China's Jobless Women Eyeing Household-Service Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Laid-off urban women in China now
have greater opportunities for reemployment, as many families in
big cities are now seeking domestic services such as house
cleansing and nursing care for the young and elderly.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics shows
that 70 percent of the families in seven large cities including
Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, now demand such services, which
means 20 million job vacancies.
</P>
<P>
Some 11 million of these jobs are still vacant, and 70 percent
of them are suitable for female workers.
</P>
<P>
Dong Qiaoyun, 37, was laid-off from an electrical appliance
plant last year here in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province. With no specialty or higher education, she could only
find a household service job in a nearby residential area.
</P>
<P>
"I had felt reluctant to leave the plant and ashamed to serve
households, because I thought it was a lower job," said Dong.
</P>
<P>
A year later, she said she would not return to the plant even
if she had another chance, for she now lives a quite comfortable
live with a monthly income of 500 yuan gained from doing house
cleaning and cooking for three families.
</P>
<P>
There are 5,000 other women like Dong in this industrial city
who now find themselves of use in the service sector after being
laid off. The age of these women average between 35 and 45.
</P>
<P>
Most of them have registered at 77 household service companies,
where a contract system has been introduced to guarantee their
rights and regulate their obligations.
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, a large number of redundant rural laborers
flocked to the cities looking for household service jobs which
were, at that time, few and looked down on by the city dwellers.
</P>
<P>
However, as state-owned enterprises struggled to become leaner,
the number of urban laid-off workers soared to 7 million, and by
this month over half of them were female.
</P>
<P>
"I would rather employ a laid-off woman to do the household
work for me than a migrant worker, because it is easier to get to
know her background," said a woman living in Evergreen Park, a new
residential area in Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
Some household service companies now offer training courses for
their employees to raise the standards of service and establish a
company image.

<P>
But this corpse and the clothing have remained intact even
after 30 days, he said, adding that it's also a miracle that the
body has kept dry and in good condition in the tropical humidity.
</P>
<P>
The complete and excellent preservation of the mummy and
textiles in an area with so humid is a first in China, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mo Zhidong, head of the local cultural relics department, said
related departments have mapped out detailed methods for
protecting the corpse and the textiles, such as dirt removal,
desiccation, ironing, and packaging.
</P>
<P>
An Zhimin, an expert from the archeological research institute
of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the well-preserved
corpse and the dress will be important samples for research in the
fields of archeology, folklore, fiber study, anatomy, pathology,
zoology, botany, agriculture, and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
According to historical documents, overseas studies of ancient
corpses began in 1825 on a mummy found in Egypt. China began such
research in 1972 on a corpse unearthed from a tomb of the Han
Dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.) in Changsha, capital of central China'
s Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Tingyu, curator of the autonomous regional museum, said
that a series of scientific research programs aimed at discovering
the preservation techniques used on these mummies are ongoing
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
"This latest discovery will pioneer a new front in the country'
s scientific research on ancient corpses," Jiang added.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A well-preserved corpse dating
back to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) has been found in southwest
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists are now studying the mummification
technique used on the corpse.
</P>
<P>
Apparently having been dipped in formalin liquid, the 1.62-
meter-tall corpse is in good shape, with clear-cut skeleton and
fairly soft skin.
</P>
<P>
The hair is glossy black and in three plaits, of which the
longest is about 30 cm. There is one incisor and six other teeth
in the slightly open mouth.
</P>
<P>
The corpse was unearthed from a tomb in Lingchuan County in
northwestern Guangxi last September. At the same time, some 32
pieces of historical relics including silk gowns, cotton ankle
socks, and damask official caps and shoes, were excavated from the
tomb.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists have identified the mummy as Li Yingpin,
a senior military official who lived near the end of the Ming
Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Li's age at the time of death is estimated to have been between
60 to 70, said one archaeologist, adding that the relics will
provide valuable material for the study of the history and arts
and sciences of the period.
</P>
<P>
This discovery has stirred great interest in state cultural
relics departments and the autonomous regional government of
Guangxi, and many experts have gathered to employ methods for
protecting and preserving the corpse and the other relics.
</P>
<P>
This mummy is typical of others unearthed in southern China,
said the expert, but they usually decompose and lose color in a
few days.
</P>
<P>
"Under the irradiation of sunshine, dry goods buried
underground for a long time will often become crisp or even turn
into powder," the expert explained.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Details on Qigong, Punishments Added Chinese Officials Say Qigong Groups Not Affected By Falun Gong Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice-minister of Civil
Affairs Li Baoku and the deputy director of the State Council
Information Office Li Bing told a press conference here today that
Falun Gong practitioners will not be penalized if they break their
ties with the outlawed organization and that Qigong groups that
abide by the law will not be affected by the ban.
</P>
<P>
 The Ministry of Civil Affairs has said that the Falun Dafa
Research Society was not registered and was therefore an illegal
organization, as are all Falun Gong organizations, but most of the
2 million Falun Gong practitioners are victims of Falun Gong
organizations, the two officials said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said that the government will deal with
ordinary Falun Gong practitioners and a handful of Falun Gong
organizers and key members in different ways and that a
distinction will be made between ordinary religious beliefs and
the Falun Gong organizations.
</P>
<P>
The major task now is to educate those people who have been
hoodwinked and to get them to break away from the organizations,
he said, and Wu Zhongze, the director of the Civil Affairs
Ministry's Civil Organization Administration, added that normal
practitioners of Qigong and other physical exercises will be
allowed to continue if they follow the law.
</P>
<P>
Li Bing, of the State Council Information office, said that
according to evidence collected so far, there are a handful of
organizers and plotters behind the scene who created disturbances
and that those who violated the Public Security Act will be dealt
with accordingly and those who violated the criminal code will be
punished accordingly.

MOSCOW, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia's top women player Anna
Kournikova once again refused to show up for her native country in
the Fed Cup games.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Russia had to send to the Slovakia semifinals the
same line-up which edged favorites France 3-2 in the quarter-
finals.
</P>
<P>
Elena Likhovtseva, ranked 20th in the world, and Tatyana Panova
are expected to play the singles as they did against France.
Panova has a 7-1 record in Fed Cup, a remarkable achievement for a
player who has never reached the top 50.
</P>
<P>
The Slovaks will depend on Karina Habsudova after the team's
top player, Henrieta Nagyova, pulled out on Thursday with a hand
injury.
</P>
<P>
Habsudova, ranked 46th, has shown good form recently, winning a
tournament in Portschach, Austria, and reaching the Polish Open
final in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
She has won nine out of her last 10 matches, losing only last
Sunday's final to Conchita Martinez of Spain. Slovakia blanked
Switzerland 5-0 in the previous round to reach their first
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Russia have reached the finals of both the Fed Cup and Davis
Cup twice but have not won either competition.

MACAO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- All Chinese newspapers in Macao on
Friday carried news stories about China's ban on Falun Gong and
some papers gave comments on it.
</P>
<P>
The Journal Va Kio said in a commentary that in ancient times,
some vicious people in China had tried to achieve their personal
objectives by cheating the masses of people and arousing public
emotion in the name of religion or superstition.

The practice of Qigong, or deep-breath medication, is not a bad
thing itself, but the selfish desire sought in the name of
religion must be guarded against, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Correio Sino-Macanese newspaper said believers of Falun
Gong were carrying out political actions while besieging
government and media places.
</P>

If the adverse current cannot be stopped, the country's

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
whose GDP ranks third in the country, has decided to woo more
overseas funds into the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
An official with the provincial agricultural department said
that key areas for the use of overseas capital include raising and
processing marine aquatic products and developing agricultural
resources in the Yellow River Delta, one of China's three major
deltas.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors are especially encouraged to collaborate
with some 500 local firms in creating famous-brand agricultural
products, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, with rich agricultural resources, is a major
producer of grain, cotton, edible oils, fruit and livestock
products.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the province's agricultural sector has
attracted more than 4.85 billion U.S. dollars in investment from
over 30 foreign countries and regions, including Japan, the
Republic of Korea, Germany, the United States, Britain, Singapore,
France, and Australia.
</P>
<P>
These funds have mainly been used for the development of marine
resources and the improvement of irrigation facilities.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Exports Up 30 Percent Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has managed an export
growth of about 30 percent per annum since 1989, a local report
said.
</P>
<P>
Robert Butaagi, executive director of Uganda Export Promotion
Board, stressed that the growth of the exports is largely due to
the government's policy of trade liberalization and macro economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has varied the export products in the past few years.
Coffee was the dominant export in the early 1990s, taking about 98
percent of the country's total exports, the director said, adding
that this was dangerous for a country to depend on merely one
product, which can be adversely affected by the forces of demand
and supply.
</P>
<P>
Coffee now takes no more than 50 percent of total exports in
Uganda and the other half is taken by non-traditional exports
including fruits, vegetables, cut flowers, live animals and fish
products, Butaagi was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Large British Plant To Open in East China's Suzhou Industrial Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A large drug plant funded by the
Glaxo Wellcome Company of Britain, one of the world's leading
pharmaceutical firms, is scheduled to become operational in the
Suzhou Industrial Park in March next year.
</P>
<P>
The plant, which costs 232 million U.S. dollars for the first
phase of construction and covers an area of 14 hectares, will be
the largest production center set up by Glaxo Wellcome in the Asia-
Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
A Glaxo Wellcome spokesman said the company is confident of its
development in the industrial park and will increase investment
here in accordance with market needs.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou Industrial Park was jointly established by the
Chinese and Singapore governments in 1994, and to date has
introduced 6.07 billion U.S. dollars of investment from overseas.
</P>
<P>
On June 28, a memorandum of understanding on further
development of the park was signed between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, shares held in the park by the Chinese
side will increase from 35 percent to 65 percent as of the year
2001, while the shares held by the Singaporean side will be
reduced from 65 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou Mayor Chen Deming said the park will continue to adhere
to all set policies after these adjustments take effect.

<HEADLINE> PNG Wants Closer Ties With ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea (PNG)'s special
envoy to the on-going ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) in Singapore
said Friday that his country wants to enhance mutually beneficial
ties with the grouping and its members.
</P>
<P>
Tarcisius Eri, who represented PNG Prime Minister Mekere
Morauta as his special envoy to the AMM, told the meeting that he
would like to reaffirm PNG's commitment to maintain and expand its
ties with ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
PNG sees ASEAN and its members as partners not only in trade
and economic exchanges but also in promoting wider regional and
international cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
As scope of cooperation of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) grows, PNG will continue to explore ways of
enhancing and diversifying mutually beneficial relations with
ASEAN and its individual members.
</P>
<P>
PNG became an observer at the AMM in 1976 and has been a
special observer since 1981. "This reflects the maturing and
expanding of our relations with the member states of ASEAN," the
envoy said.
</P>
<P>
"This special relationship will enhance both political and
economic ties" with ASEAN and its members, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also asked ASEAN members to support his country's request
for a permanent associate status in ASEAN, which PNG proposed at
the Jakarta AMM in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said PNG, a South Pacific country, could help encourage the
level of cooperation by building a bridge linking the Pacific
island countries with Southeast Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
PNG is keen to promote closer constructive relations between
countries and the two regional organizations in Southeast Asia and
the South Pacific, ASEAN and the South Pacific Forum, he said.
</P>
<P>
He invited ASEAN's secretary-general and a high-level ASEAN
delegation to a summit of the South Pacific Forum.
</P>
<P>
Morauta was elected by a majority of 99-5 in the parliament as
the country's new prime minister on July 14. Eri said Morauta's
overwhelming election was a clear signal that the people of PNG
want a change of leadership in order to restore integrity to state
institutions and stabilize the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Welcomes House Speaker's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
welcomed the formal resignation of Alhaji Buhari as the Speaker of
the House of Representatives over allegations of forgery and
perjury.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Friday quoted the
President's Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Doyin Okupe as
saying Thursday that Obasanjo generally welcomed the development
and wished that the unfortunate incident be quickly put behind the
nation and that members of assembly would avoid such pitfalls in
future.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the president, Okupe rebuked criticism on the
presidency by saying "This is a young democracy and you should
understand that there is a clear separation of the various levels
of government - the executive, the legislature and the
judiciary... If there is a problem in the Assembly, the President
cannot take responsibility for that and therefore the president
cannot be dishonored by that."
</P>
<P>
Okupe said there was no reason to blame the government and the
ruling People's Democratic Party because the issue was an
individual one.
</P>
<P>
"Now, at least, it has got off everybody's neck and we can now
move forward," said the president's spokesman.

LONDON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The UK Tories held on to the seat
of Eddisbury on Friday with a majority of 1,606 -- an increase on
the 1997 general election margin.
</P>
<P>
Straw polls during the three-week campaign suggested Labor
candidate Margaret Hanson and the Conservatives' Stephen O'Brien
were neck and neck in what became a key test for the two parties.
</P>
<P>
In the event, O'Brien netted 15,465 votes -- 1,606 more than
his Labor rival, Margaret Hanson. The Liberal Democrats trailed in
third with 4,757 votes.
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, taking the seat vacated by Alistair Goodlad after he
was appointed to High Commissioner in Australia, said: "The people
of Eddisbury have sent a clear message to Tony Blair -- they feel
let down."
</P>
<P>
Conservatives hailed the second victory in a month over Blair,
who was trounced by opposition leader William Hague in June
elections for the European Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Australian Leaders Call for Health System Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia's state and territory
premiers said in Sydney Friday that the country's health system
was suffering unsustainable stress and a national inquiry was
needed for radical long-term solutions.
</P>
<P>
During a two-and-half-hour meeting on the medicare issue, the
leaders called on the federal government to conduct a Productivity
Commission inquiry into all possibilities for fixing the system.
</P>
<P>
The leaders issued a communique, saying the health system was
under unsustainable stress as a result of an aging population,
complex funding arrangements and rising costs.
</P>
<P>
It said Treasurer Peter Costello should call an 18-month
Productivity Commission inquiry into the efficiency, effectiveness
and future affordability of the delivery of health services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian Medical Association (AMA) said the
government should agree to the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
"Even Labor leaders have supported an inquiry into medicare --
it would be bizarre for the coalition to knock it back," AMA
President David Brand said.

MOGADISHU, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The insecurity that continuously
 persisted in the Somali capital is now also affecting the senior
officials of the political leaders in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified group of gunmen Friday morning attacked the
vehicle of Hirsi Mohamed Barkhadleh best known as Hirsi Aweyeh in
Huriwa District of the capital controlled by faction leader
Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
About five gunmen have opened indiscriminate fire on the
vehicle of Hirsi Aweyeh soon after he left his house early in the
morning, eyewitnesses in the neighborhood said.
</P>
<P>
According to one of the eyewitnesses, the gunmen had then
violently dragged the body of Hirsi Aweyeh out of the vehicle and
sped away with the Suzuki he was driving all alone.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the attack is not yet known, however it is
learned that the perpetrators of the attack took the Suzuki
vehicle away to an undisclosed area of North Mogadishu controlled
by faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
People in northern Mogadishu suspect that incident is purely
car- jacking banditry related activity which has been popular in
the capital nowadays.
</P>
<P>
The relatives of late Hirsi Aweyeh said he was hit by four
bullets in the head which killed him instantly.
</P>
<P>
The grieved relatives could not imagine who the assailants
could have been. However, they suspected that the killing was
kind of an assassination. A spokesman for the family who is
himself a military officer said the matter will be seriously
investigated.
</P>
<P>
The deceased late Hirsi Aweyeh has been the man in charge of
the security of the international aid agencies operating in
southern Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
He has first been nominated by late General Mohamed Farah
Aidid in an official decree, and since then he had worked for the
aid agencies under that title even after late Aidid had been
succeeded by his son.
</P>
<P>
There's no word as yet from the faction of Hussein Mohamed
Aidid over the incident, however senior officials from his
faction and hundreds of relatives have this morning attended the
funeral of late Hirsi Aweyeh which took place in one of his houses
in Huriwa District of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Despite the efforts of the Islamic courts, the killing of late
Hirsi Aweyeh is signaling how everyone is vulnerable for such
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, serious armed confrontations have been reported
between the forces of the Jubba Valley Alliance that recently
captured the southern port town of Kismaio and those of the
defeated General Mohamed Saeed Hirsi Morgan outside Badhadheh
district, about 70 km southwest of Kismaio in the past two days.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian House Approves Anti-Corruption Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian House of
Representatives approved a new anti-corruption bill during their
plenary session here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the government's explanation delivered during the plenary
session, State Secretary/Justice Minister Muladi said the bill
covers seven main topics, including the existence of corporate
bodies as subjects of corruption, considering that corporations in
various forms have an increasing role in modern life.
</P>
<P>
"To enhance the performance of law enforcers in the process of
investigation, litigation and examination of corruption cases, the
bill stipulates wider authorities for investigators, public
prosecutors and judges, according to the stage of the legal
process, to request the bank(s) to freeze suspects' accounts, and
then ask the central bank (Bank Indonesia) to give clarification
on the suspects," Muladi said.
</P>
<P>
Two other basic topics arranged in this bill are the liability
of a special minimum penalty and the liability of death sentence.
</P>
<P>
The minimum penalty is meant to prevent the wide gap of
penalties.
</P>
<P>
The death sentence as an element to increase the weight of
penalty can be declared against corrupt people who have repeatedly
committed their crimes, and upon those who commit corruption
during a time of national disaster, an emergency, or when the
state is suffering from a monetary or economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"This bill also stipulates a penalty of imprisonment upon a
convict who fails to pay the fines of the state," Muladi said.
</P>
<P>
Of no less importance is the bill's stipulation which gives the
widest opportunity for the people to take part in preventing and
eradicating corruption, while still observing one's rights and
obligations according to the law.
</P>
<P>
"People are given the guarantee of protection to maintain
courage in the fight against corruption. Besides, those who have
given their services in eradicating corruption shall be given
appreciations by the government," Muladi added.
</P>
<P>
On the proposal to form an Anti-Corruption Commission, the bill
instructs the setting up of such a commission within two years.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Central Bank to Intervene Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Minister of
Finance, Daniel Yona, has said that the central bank will take
measures to rescue the country's shilling which depreciated
sharply in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Yona told the National Assembly Thursday in central city Dodoma
that one of the roles of the Bank of Tanzania is to maintain
monetary stability, including protecting the country's currency
from losing its value.
</P>
<P>
"The central bank can intervene and save the shilling. We have
enough foreign exchange reserve to protect our currency," the
minister was quoted by press reports Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
In private foreign exchange centers, the shilling is currently
traded at a mean rate of 815 for the U.S. dollar, compared with
around 720 one month ago.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister explained that the depreciation of the
shilling was a result of high demand for the currency in the local
market.
</P>
<P>
"After the decline of gold prices in the world market, many
people turned to the U.S. dollar as a reserve
currency...Therefore, demand for the dollar has grown rather
suddenly and brought about the depreciation of the shillings," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the governor of the central bank, Daudi Ballali, said
that one of the reasons for the depreciation was low exports of
both traditional and non-traditional goods during the past two
years due to adverse weather conditions.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian foreign
ministers attending a regional meeting here emphasized Friday the
necessity of promoting cooperation and economic integration in
their 10-member regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers made clear the message in their
statements at the opening session of the 32nd Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Ministerial Meeting here, which
for the first time brought together all the 10 countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia formally joined ASEAN on April 30, becoming the 10th
member of the grouping.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon told the meeting
that the forces of globalization and localization have provided
ASEAN not only the challenges to cope with, but also the
opportunities to benefit from.
</P>
<P>
"The first and the foremost condition is for us to maintain
cohesion," Siazon noted, saying the region's past success speaks
loud the "vision of one united Southeast Asia."
</P>
<P>
He also said that by affirming the commitment to the ASEAN Free
Trade Area (AFTA) to accelerate its implementation, ASEAN
countries have done the right thing in strengthening solidarity
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has decided to advance the completion of AFTA in the six
original signatories -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand -- by one year from the year
2003 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
The newer members will maximize the number of their tariff
lines subject to tariffs of 0-5 percent, by 2003 for Vietnam and
2005 for Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuman said ASEAN countries must
coordinate more closely their policies, especially on important
political, economic and social issues.
</P>
<P>
He said the region's interests must continue to prevail in the
process of closer economic integration to ensure the long-term
dynamism and competitiveness of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said ASEAN's
strength lies in enhancing regional cohesion by creating a true
community of Southeast Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
"In a world that is so inter-dependent and inter-connected, the
Southeast Asian region cannot and must not become divided again,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nguyen
Manh Cam said it is important to consolidate and strengthen
ASEAN's unity and cooperation on the basis of the grouping's
fundamental principles, especially consensus, non-interference in
each other's internal affairs and unity in diversity.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Nam Hong said his country, as
ASEAN's newest member, will work closely with other members in the
process of economic integration to realize the Vision 2020, the
region's long-term and broad blueprint adopted by ASEAN leaders in
1997.
</P>
<P>
He also called on ASEAN members to speak with one voice despite
their differences on the threshold of the new century.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Laos, Brunei, Myanmar and Indonesia
also touched upon in their statements the topic of cooperation in
the process of the region's economic integration.
</P>
<P>
After the opening session in the morning, the 10 ASEAN
ministers had an informal retreat in the afternoon to exchange
views only among themselves.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are expected to issue a joint communique at the
end of their meeting on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Ministerial Meeting will be followed by the ASEAN
Regional Forum and the Post Ministerial Conference, two broader
gatherings which bring in China, Japan, the European Union, the
United States, Japan and Russia, among others.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Build Theme Parks in Former U.S. Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Theme parks like the famous
Seaworld, Marine World and Disney Europe will be established in
Subic Bay, a former U.S. naval base in the Philippines, a ranking
Philippine official announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
Felicito Payumo, chairman of Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority,
said big names in the international circles engaged in the
development of theme parks in the United States will be visiting
Subic soon to conduct an ocular study of possible sites for theme
parks.
</P>
<P>
According to Payumo's plans, the main attraction of the theme
parks would be a 500-meter underwater glass tunnel crossing the
bay, effecting a reverse aquarium for people to watch the marine
life in their actual habitat.
</P>
<P>
Payumo also foresees a cable car service that would pass
through the Subic forest for people to appreciate the variety of
flora and fauna thriving in one of the last remaining forests in
the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that although there are other such parks scattered in
Asia, those in Subic will be an advantage because of the country's
climate.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas Japanese and other Asian countries usually close their
parks to tourists during winter, ours will be a year-round
operation and during winter in other countries, we will be
attracting a major bulk of the tourists to come to Subic," Payumo
said.

<HEADLINE> China's Consumer Confidence Continues to Rise (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese consumers' confidence in
the economy continued to rise in June, as the Index of Consumer
Expectation (ICE) surged back to a higher level than at the
beginning of the year under the impact of a buoyant stock market.
</P>
<P>
However, consumers still hold a prudent view of the long-term
economic situation for the next five years, expressing concerns
about future employment and income potential.
</P>
<P>
The China Business Climate Monitoring Center under the National
Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in its June report released today said
that the ICE rose by 0.4 points over May to 94.1 points, nearly
one point higher than in January.
</P>
<P>
The report also shows that the other consumer-confidence
indices, the Index of Current Consumer Economic Conditions (ICC)
and the Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS), both registered overall
growth over the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are optimistic about the economy's strength for the
next 12 months, with the percentage of people expecting a better
economic performance rising by 1.7 points over May, while the
proportion of people expecting a worsening economy dropped by 0.7
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Some 45.2 percent of those surveyed said the economy will be
better in the next 12 months, while only 9.1 percent expect a
downturn, and fewer people are uncertain about the economy in the
short term.
</P>
<P>
However, the proportion of people who are optimistic about the
economy for the five years grew by only one percentage point to 44.
6 percent, while that of people who are pessimistic grew at the
faster rate of 1.7 percentage points to 14.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
An NBS official said that the people's caution about economic
performance in the long term can be attributed to four factors.

<P>
First, the record drop of the retail price index during the
past 21 consecutive months poses an increasing threat to corporate
profits and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Second, reform of state-owned enterprises was hindered by the
lagging development of medicare, pensions, and other social
security systems.
</P>
<P>
Third, the expectation of unemployment rose as reform continued
to deepen. In June, 70 percent of the people said unemployment
will rise in the future.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, the aging population is putting a greater burden on the
labor force.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that people's expectations for their own
financial situation is increasingly polarized, with the indexes
for those expecting a better life and those expecting a worse life
rising respectively 0.4 and 0.8 points.
</P>
<P>
Over half of the people said they believe that now is the time
to buy durable consumer goods. Near 14 percent of the people
surveyed have invested in stock market, indicating they are saving
less and investing and spending more.
</P>
<P>
The report said people are now mainly concerning about issues
such as raising their children, caring for the aged people, and
buying housing.
</P>
<P>
Local economists say that lackluster demand is due to consumer
uncertainty over the future of the economy and their own economic
well-being.
</P>
<P>
They suggest that measures should be taken to increase people's
income and accelerate the establishment of social security systems.

Falun Gong practitioners will not be penalized if they break their
ties with the outlawed organization and that Qigong groups that
abide by the law will not be affected by the ban.
</P>
<P>
 The Ministry of Civil Affairs has said that the Falun Dafa

ordinary Falun Gong practitioners and a handful of Falun Gong
organizers and key members in different ways and that a
distinction will be made between ordinary religious beliefs and
the Falun Gong organizations.

The major task now is to educate those people who have been
hoodwinked and to get them to break away from the organizations,
he said, and Wu Zhongze, the director of the Civil Affairs
Ministry's Civil Organization Administration, added that normal
practitioners of Qigong and other physical exercises will be
allowed to continue if they follow the law.

Gates repeated his notion of a "PC-Plus" era, where computers
will continue to act as a basic communications tool and work
together with other devices.
</P>
<P>
He said that the heart of Microsoft's vision is the goal of
empowering people with software -- any time, any place and on any
device.
</P>
<P>
In the office this means software offers screen resolution good
enough to make the paperless office a reality, few and more
effective meetings thanks to advanced communications tools,
digital feedback loops that speed the analysis of complex business
problems, and greater competitiveness in the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
In the home, he said, the PC-Plus era will bring about the most
radical changes. PC-based software will combine with a new
generation of wireless networks, smart devices and intelligent
appliances to bring a wealth of new digital products into the
homes.
</P>
<P>
The developments he described include a high-speed wireless
home network that enables users to play music and videos or
display family photographs, Web-TV network service with on-demand
programming and Web-enhanced content, and the next-generation of
gaming offering online competition with voice interaction,
immersive audio, 3-D graphics and the option of parental control.
</P>
<P>
He said that Microsoft plans to invest 3.7 billion U.S. dollars
in research and development this fiscal year, and a big part of
that effort will be to make those digital products available.

<HEADLINE> AIDS to Bring 13 Million Orphans in Sub-Sahara by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 13 million children, the
majority of them from sub-Sahara Africa, will be orphaned due to
AIDS by 2000, a U.N.

Children's Fund (UNICEF) report says.
</P>
<P>
Out of this figure, the report says, 10.4 million will be under
the age of 15, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report observes that the scourge has left 8.2 million
children without mothers or both parents, saying in most parts of
the industrialized countries, no more than one percent of the
child population is orphaned.
</P>
<P>
Before the onset of AIDS, societies in the developing countries
absorbed orphans into extended families and communities at a rate
of just over two percent of the child population, the report
says.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, 11 percent of children in Uganda are now orphans,
while in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi, nine, seven and six percent
are orphans, respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, in 35 countries, including Kenya, the
rate at which children have been orphaned has doubled, tripled or
even quadrupled in just three years, from 1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
Because of AIDS, the report says, Asia will see its orphan
population triple by the year 2000.

SHANGHAI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Virgin Atlantic Airways,
Ltd. (VAA) will soon raise the number of flights between London
and Shanghai from two to seven as part of its effort to increase
its presence in China.
</P>
<P>
Company president Richard Branson said here recently that the
air route between the two cities has been performing well since it

The British and Chinese governments signed an agreement last
October to open the air line between London and Shanghai, and VAA
became the first operator.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, 75 percent of the passengers taking VAA's London-

<HEADLINE> China's Jobless Women Eyeing Household-Service Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Laid-off urban women in China now
have greater opportunities for reemployment, as many families in
big cities are now seeking domestic services such as house
cleansing and nursing care for the young and elderly.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics shows
that 70 percent of the families in seven large cities including
Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, now demand such services, which
means 20 million job vacancies.
</P>
<P>
Some 11 million of these jobs are still vacant, and 70 percent
of them are suitable for female workers.
</P>
<P>
Dong Qiaoyun, 37, was laid-off from an electrical appliance
plant last year here in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province. With no specialty or higher education, she could only
find a household service job in a nearby residential area.
</P>
<P>
"I had felt reluctant to leave the plant and ashamed to serve
households, because I thought it was a lower job," said Dong.
</P>
<P>
A year later, she said she would not return to the plant even
if she had another chance, for she now lives a quite comfortable
live with a monthly income of 500 yuan gained from doing house
cleaning and cooking for three families.
</P>
<P>
There are 5,000 other women like Dong in this industrial city
who now find themselves of use in the service sector after being
laid off. The age of these women average between 35 and 45.
</P>
<P>
Most of them have registered at 77 household service companies,
where a contract system has been introduced to guarantee their
rights and regulate their obligations.
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, a large number of redundant rural laborers
flocked to the cities looking for household service jobs which
were, at that time, few and looked down on by the city dwellers.
</P>
<P>
However, as state-owned enterprises struggled to become leaner,
the number of urban laid-off workers soared to 7 million, and by
this month over half of them were female.
</P>
<P>
"I would rather employ a laid-off woman to do the household
work for me than a migrant worker, because it is easier to get to
know her background," said a woman living in Evergreen Park, a new
residential area in Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
Some household service companies now offer training courses for
their employees to raise the standards of service and establish a
company image.

<HEADLINE> East China Province to Use More Overseas Funds for Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
whose GDP ranks third in the country, has decided to woo more
overseas funds into the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
An official with the provincial agricultural department said
that key areas for the use of overseas capital include raising and
processing marine aquatic products and developing agricultural
resources in the Yellow River Delta, one of China's three major
deltas.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors are especially encouraged to collaborate
with some 500 local firms in creating famous-brand agricultural
products, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, with rich agricultural resources, is a major
producer of grain, cotton, edible oils, fruit and livestock
products.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the province's agricultural sector has
attracted more than 4.85 billion U.S. dollars in investment from
over 30 foreign countries and regions, including Japan, the
Republic of Korea, Germany, the United States, Britain, Singapore,
France, and Australia.
</P>
<P>
These funds have mainly been used for the development of marine
resources and the improvement of irrigation facilities.

<HEADLINE> "Tiger" Samsonov on Prowl for Preys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Tipped as one of few European
title-hopefuls in the 45th World Table Tennis Championships,
Vladimir Samsonov has everything that makes world champion -- calm
psyche, world-class technique and battle experience.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old star from Belarus, ranked No. 1 in the world,
is set to challenge Chinese dominance in the sport. China aims for
a clean-title sweep in the biennial world championships to be held
early August in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"Just like Waldner, Samsonov is a headache for Chinese players,
" China's mass-circulation Sports Weekly quoted Chinese head coach
Cai Zhenhua as saying.
</P>
<P>
Standing 1.88 meters, the lanky Belarussian is willing to rally
until his rival leaves an opening. Once he gets chance, his
lethal forehands rarely fail him.
</P>
<P>
The high-toss serve, invented by Chinese in 1960s, has become
Samsonov's asset. His rivals often misjudge amount of spin he
put on serves, giving him a chance to make a kill.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov is also good at minute and fine maneuvers on the table,
rare for a player of such height. "Unlike most European players
who are known for strong loop drives away from table but not so
good at playing short ball, Samsonov is versatile," Cai said.
</P>
<P>
Cai called Samsonov, Sweden's reigning world champion Jan-Ove
Waldner and twice World Cup winner Zoran Primorac of Croatia as "
Three Tigers". In Chinese folklore, tiger is the most dangerous.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov caught limelight at 16 as he upset Swedish star Peter
Karlsson in the Gothenburg championships in 1993 and narrowly lost
a quarter-final berth to Rosskopf after a five-set marathon in the
1995 event.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov should have come into the medal contention in the 1996
Olympic Games if there weren't a 20-minute delay during his game
against Wang Tao.
</P>
<P>
With Samsonov leading 2-0, an unusual electricity blackout in
the court gave a breather to the jaded Wang, who snatched three
sets in a row to shut his rival out of the last four.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov reached his peak in the European Masters Cup one month
after the Olympics, beating five world elite players to win his
first major title.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997 world championships, Samsonov nipped Waldner in the
team action but lost to the Swede in the singles final. In 1998,
Samsonov won the most important crown of his career -- the
European singles champion.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov will be grouped with China's 1995 world champion Kong
Linghui in July 31 draw in Eindhoven, and they will clash for a
final berth if both reach that far. In last world championships,
Samsonov beat Kong in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
"I have a fifty-fifty chance if I meet Samsonov," said Kong. "
He is one of the best topspin players in the world. I won't be
surprised if he comes out as champion.
</P>
<P>
"But that doesn't mean I lack confidence. If I can improve my
footwork, my chance will be better."

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Official on Falun Gong Prohibition (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The official stressed that Party members should become models
of observing the country's laws and regulations, safeguard social
stability conscientiously, and voluntarily lead the masses to
fight against any activity in violation of China's laws.
</P>
<P>
"The few Party members who have participated in the Falun Gong
organization should immediately separate themselves from that
organization, and stop attending activities sponsored by the Falun
Gong organization," the official urged.
</P>
<P>
The Falun Dafa, or Falun Gong, concocted by Li Hongzhi,
advocates idealism and theism, denies all science and truth, and
contradicts modern science and modern civilization, and the basic
theories and principles of Marxism, as well as China's great cause
of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"All Party members must observe the Constitution of the
Communist Party of China, and firmly believe in Marxism, instead
of embracing Falun Dafa," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Marxism believes that the productive forces are the decisive
factor for social development, and history is created by the
people, while Li Hongzhi claims that social development has been
arranged and decided by God and is controlled by him, which denies
the objective laws of social development, the official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Marxists are atheists who hold the belief that there is no
supernatural God. But Li Hongzhi proclaims that everything in the
universe, from celestial bodies to elementary particles, including
human beings, have been created by "Dajuezhe." Also, he claims
that he is the only savior of the world.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that the malicious fallacies advocated
by Falun Dafa are completely at odds with fundamental purpose of
the Party, namely to serve the people wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
"Party members should always keep in mind and implement the
Party's fundamental purpose, give priority to the interests of the
Party and the people, stick to the communist ideal and the belief
in socialism with Chinese characteristics, and unite and lead the
masses to contribute to China's reform, economic development and
social stability," he said.

<HEADLINE> Evacuees Face Flood Threat Calmly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- While the memory of last year's
serious floods is still alive in the minds of the people who dwell
by the Yangtze River, the river is swollen once more with raging
flood waters.
</P>
<P>
What does a little girl whose house was washed away last year
think of the new danger?
</P>
<P>
Like others evacuated from the flood-threatened areas, nine-
year-old Zhou Wenwen is perfectly calm and composed, although the
sound of the flood waters can be heard not far away, beyond the
reinforced river levees.
</P>
<P>
Zhou is among the one million people who have been moved out of
the areas directly endangered by the Yangtze floods in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
She now lives happily and peacefully with her parents in a new
two-story building in the Migrants' New Village, specially built
for resettled people in Jianli County in central China's Hubei
Province this year.
</P>
<P>
"My little daughter was so scared at the sight of collapsed
houses that I could feel her shivering when we returned home after
the floods retreated last year," said Zhou's mother.
</P>
<P>
The girl was so shy when she heard her mother's remarks that
she immediately buried her face behind homework books. She did not
notice when the third flood crest passed the Jianli section of the
Yangtze, which is only about one km away, early yesterday morning.
</P>
<P>
The flood crest was as high as the largest one last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's mother said that all the furniture in her house and
water melons that had just been reaped from the fields were washed
away in last year's floods.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old woman said that the government had provided her
family with more than 10,000 yuan (about 1,200 US dollars) as a
subsidy, which is equivalent to 80 percent of the total cost of
her new home.
</P>
<P>
All the 4,800 resettled families in Jianli County had been
relocated properly before this year's flood season came. No one
has to live in shabby temporary shelters on the river dikes, as
they did last year.
</P>
<P>
Today, only the tops of trees can be seen above the flood
waters, if you stand on the river dikes. Some young men can be
seen playing snooker, some women are chatting together, and light
music is heard coming from houses.
</P>
<P>
The local government has mobilized local people to guard
against possible floods, but the number of them is definitely
smaller than that of last year.

<HEADLINE> NPC Vice Chairman Calls for Enhanced Forest Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China should do more to raise
citizens' awareness of the importance of forests protection and
related laws, a senior legislator said here today.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, China's top legislative body, made the remarks
at the second plenary session on the NPC inspection of the
enforcement of the Forestry Law.
</P>
<P>
The inspection teams, sent to four provinces and autonomous
regions over the past two months, have found that though the laws
are being implemented, some problems still exist.
</P>
<P>
"Some places have not fully realized the significance of forest-
resource protection and development, and have failed to properly
deal with the relationship between the ecological environment and
economic growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
People's awareness of forest protection should be raised, and
special efforts also must be made to help leading officials in
various places realize this, he added.
</P>
<P>
The legislator also noted the problems of poor management of
existing forests and excessive logging and deforestation for the
purposes of farming and construction.
</P>
<P>
"We should be clear about the problems, and adopt the most
stringent measures to protect and manage forest resources
according to the law," he said.

contacts with Egypt would easily use the JBC. "Those willing to
travel to Egypt can do so through the council, those membership is
open to everyone," Ghanima said.

ASEAN countries in the field of agro-industry, housing and
construction, power transmission, telecommunications, electrical
products facility, lighting, logging and tourism, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
The mission to be led by Ahmad Kamaruzaman Mohamed Baria, the

relations with the four countries, promoting exports of Malaysian
manufactured products and assist in the identification of sources
of imports for local requirements, it said.
</P>

The delegation, which comprises officials, 77 private sector
members representing 58 companies from both the manufacturing and

<HEADLINE> Australian Imports Cost Falls as Currency Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The cost of imports of Australia
is falling as the Australian dollar strengthens, the Australian
Bureau of Statistics said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The import price index, compiled by the bureau as part of its
periodic review of trade prices, fell by 2.7 percent in the three
months to June.
</P>
<P>
The index was also down 2.2 percent on the June quarter 1998,
the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
"The continued appreciation of the Australian dollar against
other currencies contributed to the fall in the index for the June
quarter," the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
"Increased prices for petroleum products reduced the size of
the decrease."
</P>
<P>
Prices for road vehicles and machinery dropped by 3.9 percent,
animal and vegetable oil 7.3 percent and chemical products 4.3
percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
But mineral fuel prices increased by 23 percent, partially
offsetting the price falls, the bureau said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Space Shuttle Columbia Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States launched
space shuttle Columbia in Cape Canaveral in Florida state early
Friday with a 1.5-billion-dollar X-ray telescope on board and
Eileen Collins in charge -- the first woman to command a U.S.
space mission.
</P>
<P>
The launch of Columbia has been postponed twice. The first
launch attempt, on Tuesday, ended six seconds before liftoff when
a dangerous hydrogen buildup was detected in the engine
compartment. It turned out to be a false alarm. The second launch
attempt, on Thursday, failed because of bad weather.
</P>
<P>
Seven hours after liftoff, Columbia's five crew members are
expected to eject the powerful Chandra X-ray Observatory from the
shuttle. For five years, it will scrutinize stars, galaxies and
quasars, search for black holes and study the so-called black
matter that fills the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
Collins, 42, an Air Force colonel and a former test pilot, is
making her third space flight. She flew before as a shuttle co-
pilot.
</P>
<P>
She said she is honored to be the first woman to command a
mission in 38 years of U.S. human space flight, and that a female
commander is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
The 15-meter Chandra is the biggest X-ray telescope ever built
and the heaviest payload ever put aboard a space shuttle. With its
attached rocket motor and support gear, Chandra weighs 22,700
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The entire Chandra project, including the shuttle ride and five
years of orbital operations, comes in at 2.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
After decades of working on the program, dozens of scientists
gathered at the launch site in anticipation. The telescope should
have flown last August but was grounded first by software problems,
then bad circuit boards, then a suspect rocket motor.

SINGAPORE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Foreign Minister U Win
Aung Friday lashed out at NATO's military attack against
Yugoslavia, saying it violated the U.N. Charter and the basic

</P>
<P>
"Myanmar deeply deplores the action of NATO in Yugoslavia,"
said U Win Aung in his statement at the opening session of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)'s 32nd Ministerial
Meeting here.
</P>
<P>
"The NATO intervention in the internal affairs of Yugoslavia
was a violation of the U.N. Charter and the basic norms of the
International Law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The NATO actions have caused the loss of lives of many
innocent civilians, including women and children," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the world should not and cannot be put under
the control of one country or of a group of countries.
</P>
<P>
"A country's affairs should be handled by its own people and
international issues should be resolved through negotiations and
not through military means," he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO's nearly three months of air attacks against Yugoslavia,
which began on March 24, caused the death of thousands of
civilians. NATO's action in Yugoslavia has aroused the concern of
many countries over world peace and stability.

<P>
NEW DELHI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- India has reduced by four
percent its export target for coffee and tea to 9,230 million
Indian rupees (219.8 million U.S. dollars) during the current
financial year against 9,520.4 million Indian rupees (226.7
million U.S. dollars) in 1998-99, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The target has been pegged low in view of a downtrend in
shipments of these two commodities since the beginning of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The target for tea has been lowered to 5,230 million Indian
rupees (124.5 million U.S. dollars) for the current financial year
against last fiscal's exports of 5,471.9 million Indian rupees
(130.2 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
For coffee, the target has been fixed lower at 4,000 million
Indian rupees (95.2 million U.S. dollars) from 4,048 million
Indian rupees (96.4 million U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
During the last fiscal, coffee export value slid by 11.29
percent, while that of tea increased by 8.38 percent. As a result,
these commodities exports declined to 9,520.4 million Indian
rupees (226.7 million U.S. dollars) from 9,612.4 million Indian
rupees (228.9 million U.S. dollars) in 1997-98.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Dismisses Falun Gong As Religion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official dismissed Falun
Dafa as a kind of religious belief and reiterated that freedom of
belief in religion is protected by the Constitution of the People'
s Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Wu Zhongze, director of the Non-governmental Organization
Management Bureau under the Ministry of Civil Affairs, told a
press conference here today that China's constitution protects the
freedom of religious belief and normal religious activities.
</P>
<P>
However, the Falun Gong founded by Li Hongzhi just "copies some
skills of qigong exercises and religious phrases", which are
pieced together with some superstitious thinking, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks in response to a Hong Kong reporter's
question about the freedom of religious belief in China.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed out that the Regulations on the Registration and
Management of Mass Organizations stipulates that mass
organizations should be registered and their activities abide by
the constitution, laws, regulations and policies of the country.
The organizations should not violate fundamental principles of the

<HEADLINE> Edible Oil Imports Treble in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- India's edible oil imports more
than trebled to 2.452 million tons during the first nine months of
the current oil year (November 1998-October 1999) compared with
745,000 tons shipments during the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Solvent Extractors Association of India (SEAI) said in a
press release here Thursday that RBD (refined, bleached and
deodorized) palm olein imports made up 1.322 million tons of the
total.
</P>
<P>
In June alone, imports were up by more than three times
compared with the same month last year, mainly on account of lower
palm olein prices in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Edible oil imports in June totaled 564,000 tons compared with
175,000 tons in June 1998, SEAI said.
</P>
<P>
India's edible oil demand for 1998-1999 season has been put at
8.2 million tons and domestic supply at 1.4 to 1.5 million tons.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Push Ahead With Integration Despite Setbacks: S'pore PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN will push ahead with
greater economic integration and openness despite the setbacks it
has suffered during the regional economic crisis in the past two
years, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok tong said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address to the two-day 32nd ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting (AMM) in Singapore, Goh said ASEAN's reputation has been
seriously dented by the economic crisis which has exposed the
structural flaws behind member countries' past "miraculous
growth."
</P>
<P>
New tensions have also emerged among members of ASEAN (the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and even some of its
dialogue partners also questioned the grouping's future, he
admitted.
</P>
<P>
But he said the "worst is over," and ASEAN is now on the road
to recovery. ASEAN countries have embarked on structural reforms
like improving corporate governance, recapitalizing banks and
enhancing financial system supervision, he said, adding that many
member countries are running current account surpluses and
building up foreign exchange reserves, and regional stock markets
have rebounded sharply.
</P>
<P>
However, Goh cautioned people against being complacent, saying
the recovery is only "nascent" and can be easily derailed. He
cited the large corporate bad debt overhang and the sluggish pace
of corporate reforms as among the internal weaknesses that remain
to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
He also listed external factors that could impede the regional
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
He echoed the concerns over the exuberance in Wall Street,
whose dissipation could derail U.S. growth and have tidal effects
on Europe and Asia's recovery.
</P>
<P>
The slow Japanese recovery colors the prospects of the entire
region and China's economic health will have an impact on the
region's growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The stability of the U.S.-China-Japan triangular relationship
is a vital factor underpinning regional security, and by
extension, regional recovery," he said.
</P>
<P>
Disillusionment with the free market system has grown against
the backdrop of the financial crisis, as many developing countries
are resorting to protectionist measures to counter the effects of
globalization and even some developed countries have become
selectively protectionistic to stem the influx of more competitive
products from the developing world, he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, Goh said, must keep its markets open and plugged into
the rest of the world. "The march towards greater economic
integration and interdependence is inexorable," and "a retreat
from openness is at best a temporary solution."
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN must also become more united to stand up to the
rise of regionalism in North America, South America and Western
Europe. The uncertainty about whether regionalism will encourage
greater interaction between nations or greater insularity of
regions underscores the importance for ASEAN to build bridges with
other regions sooner rather than later, he said.
</P>
<P>
Goh expressed the hope that the current ASEAN foreign
ministers' meeting would take stock of past experiences by
"beginning a process of honest reappraisal." ASEAN's reputation
will not be restored until regional economies fully recover, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The AMM will be followed by a one-day ASEAN Regional Forum
(ARF) and a two-day Post Ministerial Conference (PMC) which also
involve ASEAN's dialogue partners, including China, Russia, Japan,
the European Union and the United States.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Meeting Opens to Hold All Regional Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) opened Friday its 32nd Ministerial Meeting
(AMM) here to embrace for the first time all 10 countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Attending Friday's opening ceremony are Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong, ASEAN Secretary-General Rodolfo Severino
and foreign ministers from the ten ASEAN member countries.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that all ten Southeast Asian countries
are attending as full ASEAN members the AMM and subsequent related
meetings. Cambodia is the newest member that joined ASEAN in April
at a special ceremony in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Singapore, Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, Brunei,
Malaysia, Vietnam, Myanmar, the Philippines and Laos.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day event, ASEAN foreign ministers are expected
to utilize their first such gathering to discuss issues concerning
the regional grouping's future and challenges.
</P>
<P>
Friday afternoon, the ministers will have an informal retreat
to exchange views only among themselves, a move initiated by
Singapore, ASEAN's rotating chairman, to actuate more realistic
talks.
</P>
<P>
At the AMM, the ministers will review the progress in the
implementation of the Hanoi Plan of Action (HPA), adopted at the
ASEAN summit in Hanoi last December, said Severino Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The HPA is the first in a series of concrete plans mapped out
to realize the Vision 2020, a long-term and broad blueprint for
the region approved by ASEAN leaders in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will be preparing for this November's ASEAN
summit in Manila, the Philippines, said Severino, adding that the
summit will review the implementation of the HPA and issue further
directives.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN foreign ministers will also meet with their
dialogue partners to focus on how the two sides can cooperate in
carrying out the projects detailed in the HPA.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's role in the subsequent ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) will
also be among the ministers' topics, said Singapore Foreign
Minister Shunmugam Jayakumar Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar said he and his counterparts will discuss "how ASEAN
can play and continue to play a pivotal role" in the ARF, a
broader gathering bringing in Japan, Russia, the European Union,
the United States and China, among others.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's 10 dialogue partners, including China, Russia, the
European Union and the United States, are part of the 22-member
ARF and the following Post Ministerial Conference.
</P>
<P>
The AMM is an annual event responsible for the formulation of
policy guidelines and coordination of ASEAN activities. The last
AMM was held in Manila last July.

</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the government will deal with, in different

</P>
<P>
A distinction will also be made between ordinary religious
beliefs and the illegal Falun Gong organizations and their
activities.
</P>

The normal physical exercises and organized illegal Falun Gong
activities will also be treated differently.

<HEADLINE> China to Introduce OTC Medicine System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China will enforce a regulation on
the classified management of prescribed and non-prescription, or
over-the-counter (OTC), medicines from next year, according to a
report in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The regulation to be issued by the State Drug Administration (
SDA) stipulated that prescribed medicines must be sold and used
under the guidance of medical professionals, while consumers can
freely buy OTC medicines without advice of professionals.
</P>
<P>
The label and instructions for OTC medicines must be approved
by SDA and the content must be based on science, easy to
understand and convenient for consumers to choose and use, said
Zheng Xiaoyu, director of the SDA.
</P>
<P>
Chinese doctors and pharmaceutical specialists have selected
225 varieties of western and traditional Chinese medicines to be
sold in pharmacies as OTC medicines.
</P>
<P>
"SDA believes the adoption of classified management of
prescription and OTC medicines may help provide access to
international practices and work to enhance supervision and
management of drugs while improving safety and effectiveness,"
Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are expected to buy safe and effective medicines for
minor diseases from pharmacies, instead of withstanding lengthy
waits to see a doctor and pay a high price for medicines
prescribed in hospitals, he said.

URUMQI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region has led the country in embryo transplants for
animal reproduction over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the Xinjiang Academy of Animal Husbandry have
implanted the inseminated embryos of cattle imported from New
Zealand into the wombs of 5,000 local cows, and the region plans

</P>
<P>
As China's leading pastoral zone, Xinjiang has 3.7 million
cattle, of which 1.6 million are cows of breeding age.
</P>
<P>
Transplants of embryos of high-quality livestock will eliminate
inferior breeds in a short period of time, and raise the economic
returns of animal husbandry, Jin said.

</P>
<P>
Vietnam conducted its third nationwide population and housing
census on April 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the release of the preliminary results of the 1999
Vietnamese population and housing census, the population of
Vietnam is 76,324,753, consisting of 37,519,754 males (49.2
percent) and 38,804,999 females (50.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
On the enumeration date of April 1, 1999, 17,916,983 persons
(23.5 percent) were usual residents of the urban areas. The
remaining 58,407,770 (76.5 percent) reside in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
However, the release also said that a post enumeration survey
found an undercount rate of 1.23 percent. Taking this undercount
into consideration, the total population of Vietnam would be over
77 million, the release added.
</P>
<P>
The census shows that Vietnam has 3,695 centenarians of whom
855 or 23.1 percent are male and 2,840 or 76.9 percent are female.
Among the centenarians, 17 are in the top age of 120-130 years.
Vietnam's oldest person is a Hmong nationality woman, who lives in
Vietnam's northwestern Lai Chau province.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam conducted its first nation-wide population census in
October 1, 1979. Vietnam's population at that time was 52.7
million. Vietnam conducted its second nation-wide population
census in April 1, 1989. At that time, Vietnam's population was
64.4 million.
</P>
<P>
During the 9.5 years, from October 1, 1979 to April 1, 1989,
the population of Vietnam increased by 11.6 million, showing an
annual growth rate of 2.1 percent. The increase in the next 10
years (1989-1999) was only by 11.9 million or 1.7 percent per
year.

<HEADLINE> Argentine FM Defends Notion of Shared Sovereignty Over Malvinas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Argentine Foreign Minister
Guido di Tella on Thursday defended the idea of a shared
sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands between his country and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Di Tella said that President Carlos Menem proposed on several
occasions a shared sovereignty of the islands with Britain, which
has showed flexibility.
</P>
<P>
Shared sovereignty is a question for the future and "is not on
a short term agenda," because it needs to revise the country's
constitution, he added.
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Britain signed on July 14 an agreement to resume
direct flights from  Argentine mainland to the Malvinas, to
reestablish communications with the islands and to build a
monument for Argentine soldiers killed in the 1982 Argentina-
Britain war over the archipelago.
</P>
<P>
Di Tella noted that the passport seal for Argentines entering
the Malvinas Islands does not mean a recognition of the islands'
sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Meeting Opens to Hold All Regional Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) opened Friday its 32nd Ministerial Meeting
(AMM) here to embrace for the first time all 10 countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Attending Friday's opening ceremony are Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong, ASEAN Secretary-General Rodolfo Severino
and foreign ministers from the ten ASEAN member countries.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that all ten Southeast Asian countries
are attending as full ASEAN members the AMM and subsequent related
meetings. Cambodia is the newest member that joined ASEAN in April
at a special ceremony in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Singapore, Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, Brunei,
Malaysia, Vietnam, Myanmar, the Philippines and Laos.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day event, ASEAN foreign ministers are expected
to utilize their first such gathering to discuss issues concerning
the regional grouping's future and challenges.
</P>
<P>
Friday afternoon, the ministers will have an informal retreat
to exchange views only among themselves, a move initiated by
Singapore, ASEAN's rotating chairman, to actuate more realistic
talks.
</P>
<P>
At the AMM, the ministers will review the progress in the
implementation of the Hanoi Plan of Action (HPA), adopted at the
ASEAN summit in Hanoi last December, said Severino Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The HPA is the first in a series of concrete plans mapped out
to realize the Vision 2020, a long-term and broad blueprint for
the region approved by ASEAN leaders in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will be preparing for this November's ASEAN
summit in Manila, the Philippines, said Severino, adding that the
summit will review the implementation of the HPA and issue further
directives.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN foreign ministers will also meet with their
dialogue partners to focus on how the two sides can cooperate in
carrying out the projects detailed in the HPA.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's 10 dialogue partners, including China, Russia, the
European Union and the United States, are part of the ASEAN
Regional Forum and the Post Ministerial Conference, two broader
gatherings held after the AMM.
</P>
<P>
The AMM is an annual event responsible for the formulation of
policy guidelines and coordination of ASEAN activities. The last
AMM was held in Manila last July.

<HEADLINE> Analysis of Falun Gong Leader's Malicious Fallacies (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Falun Dafa, or Falun Gong, an
illegal organization headed by Li Hongzhi, has deceived a lot of
people and harmed them in recent years and been involved in many
illegal activities that have seriously disrupted public order,
misguided people, and confused right and wrong, a signed article
said.
</P>
<P>
The article by the Policy and Law and Regulations Department of
the State Press and Publication Administration said that Falun
Gong has a set of ridiculous ideas, a basic one of which claims
that doomsday is coming, that human beings will be extinct soon,
that modern science can do nothing to prevent the catastrophe,
that only Falun Gong can save mankind, and that Li Hongzhi is the
sole "savior."
</P>
<P>
Because of this doomsday prediction, Li ordered his followers
to concentrate on their Falun Gong and forbid them to hold any
other belief. Human civilization has experienced at least 81
periodic changes, he says, and society is now deteriorating and if
this trend continues, it will be exterminated.
</P>
<P>
Anyone with any sense can find that during different periods of
human history there have been certain social problems, big and
small, and that civilization is still evolving in the course of
the problems being solved one after another.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Li's doomsday idea denies the truth of the existing
world and it has created strong anti-government and anti-social
sentiments. Its true purpose is to win public support for his
wicked political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Government is useless is another of Li's ideas, one to make
Falun Gong the ruling ideology in the world and to allow him to
seize power that "overruns the government and the law." Social
problems have been emerging, he said, and no government can solve
them. And, because neither the government nor the law can solve
social problems, he should be the rightful ruler.
</P>
<P>
He has renounced modern science and said the world should
listen to him, otherwise everything will be lost.
</P>
<P>
His malicious fallacies serve his viperous political aims and
were the foundation for the organization's teaching centers and
instruction stations, which are institutions involved in secret
activities and backyard conspiracies.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Falun Dafa is the only grand theory that can
save mankind and is the most profound and superb of all sciences
and philosophies and a ladder for people to ascend to heaven.
</P>
<P>
Li has held up a banner of "Truthfulness, Benevolence and
Tolerance" but can not stand any criticism or alternative views.
Whenever Falun Gong is criticized, he gets his followers to create
a disturbance. Their attacks by gathering outside media
organizations' office buildings in 1998 and outside the
headquarters of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist
Party of China and Zhongnanhai in Beijing, the compound of the
central Party and government, in April this year can in no way be
considered tolerant.

<TEXT>
<P>
Li said that to practice Falun Gong well people must make a
clean break with other ideas and can not mention what they learned
before and are forbidden to use what they feel, see, or know, or
the doctrines of other sects, otherwise, they will learn a false
grand theory and damage the grand theory.
</P>
<P>
By spreading these fallacious ideas Li has actually signed a
life-and-death contract with his followers, who have to obey all
his instructions and depend on him for everything. He forbids them
to read other books or learn other theories and deprives them of
the ability to choose between right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
With these means and the tight controls of the highly organized
group, Li forces practitioners to follow his fallacious ideas. He
has also borrowed Buddhist doctrines to deify himself and claims
that he possesses the "body of law" and can install "the wheel of
law" in practitioners and give them extrasensory perception.
</P>
<P>
Some followers were deceived by this and began to look for
supernatural powers and many have become psychopathic. In 1997 and
1998 a fifth of the patients in the psychopath ward of a hospital
were Falun Gong practitioners.
</P>
<P>
Li usually belittles great scientists like Charles Darwin and
Issac Newton, although he himself is just a junior middle school
graduate who doesn't know the difference between an organism and
minerals. He said that he is the only person who can explain the
mysteries of the universe and that the earth is nothing but a
garbage dump. He also says that man was created by gods and life
and death and disease are debts acquired in previous lives.
</P>
<P>
Many people have been confused by these fallacious ideas and
have refused to go to hospital for medical treatment when they
became ill, and a number have died as a result.
</P>
<P>
All of this reveals the preposterousness of Li's ideas, then
why does he have so many followers? First, Li has taken advantage
of people's desire to find a cure for illness. Second, he
exaggerates the danger of some problems and social evils that
bother common people. Third, he has used the cover of "
Truthfulness, Benevolence and Tolerance" to encourage people who
lack mental or spiritual ballast or have no beliefs to wish for
things that don't exist.

<HEADLINE> Australia Asked to Help Trace Suspected Nazi Criminal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- An 88-year-old Australian man has
been traced by Lithuania for alleged genocide crimes in World War
II.
</P>
<P>
The Australian daily The Age reported Friday that the
Lithuanian Foreign Ministry Wednesday made a formal request for
Australia's cooperation via the Australian embassy in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
The traced man, Antanas Gudelis, headed a military unit under
the authority of the German occupation power and emigrated to
Australia after the war. Now he lives in Adelaide with his family.
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian Prosecutor-General's Office filed genocide
charges Monday against Gudelis over the deaths of more than
10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center discovered new
documents in Lithuanian government archives which evidenced that
Gudelis's unit was involved in the largest mass murder of Jews in
Lithuania on October 28, 1941.
</P>
<P>
On that day, more than 9,200 men, women and children in Kaunas,
the then Lethuanian capital, were executed.
</P>
<P>
Gudelis had been under scrutiny in 1992 and the Australian
government's special investigations unit concluded that the
evidence was not enough to bring Gudelis to trial.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Explains Ban on Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here today that the Chinese government's ban on the Falun Gong
conforms to the will of the people and has enjoyed broad support
of the people.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made by Li Baoku, vice-minister of Civil
Affairs, at a press conference held by the Information Office of
the State Council this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Civil Affairs Thursday announced that the
Research Society of Falun Dafa and the Falun Gong organizations
under its control were illegal organizations and formally banned
them.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, there are four major reasons for his ministry
to make the decision.
</P>
<P>
"The Research Society of Falun Dafa headed by Li Hongzhi (
founder of the Falun Gong) has not registered with the competent
authorities according to law and it has engaged in illegal
activities," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the Falun Gong organizations have instigated
troubles and incidents and have undermined social stability.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Li Hongzhi and his Falun Dafa of having
advocated superstition and malicious fallacies and deceived people
and harmed their physical and mental health.
</P>
<P>
"The illegal activities by Li and the Falun Gong organizations
have long aroused the strong resentment among the people from all
walks of life," said Li, adding that many people have "strongly
appealed to the government to take legal actions against this
illegal organization".

<HEADLINE> Tyson Might Fight Douglas in Rematch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson is likely to choose
James "Buster" Douglas as an opponent for next comeback on October
2 at Las Vegas, according to Jay Larkin senior vice president in
charge of sports for showtime
</P>
<P>
It would be a good time for the former heavyweight champion to
take an avenge at his shocking loss to Douglas in Tokyo nine years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old Douglas is one of three men being considered as
an opponent for Tyson. Larkin said the other two are 33-year-old
Orlin Norris and 30-year-old Zeljko Mavrovic.
</P>
<P>
"We've been negotiating with all three of them simultaneously,"
he said Thursday. "We hope to have things done by the end of next
week."
</P>
<P>
Tyson was knocked out in the 10th round by Douglas, a 42-1 shot,
on February 11, 1990.
</P>
<P>
Douglas lost the undisputed title when he was knocked out in
the third round by Evander Holyfield in 1990. He then retired, but
his weight soared to more than 400 pounds and in 1994 he was
hospitalized in a diabetic coma.
</P>
<P>
Since coming back in 1996, he has won eight of nine fights
against mostly mediocre opponents.

Republican lawmaker Bob Barr led a parade of House members in
support of full funding of the radar-evading F-22 but never called
for a vote to restore 1.8 billion U.S. dollars deleted by House
appropriators.
</P>
<P>
Removing the money because of concern over rising F-22 costs
gives the House leverage in its negotiations with the Senate over
the final defense budget. Republican Senator John Warner,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday he
would seek a compromise on F-22 funding to continue the program.
</P>
<P>
With little debate on major provisions of the defense bill, the
House voted 379-45 to approve it. The defense spending approved by
the House was up three billion U.S. dollars from President Bill
Clinton's request.
</P>
<P>
The bill would give 1.4 million active duty personnel a 4.8
percent pay increase. It also adds 592 million U.S. dollars for
recruiting and for programs aimed at keeping personnel in the
military. All of the services have been falling short of
recruiting goals.
</P>
<P>
Money from the F-22 would be diverted to other programs,
including buying more F-15 and F-16 fighters and KC-130J air
tanker planes that were not in the Clinton Administration's budget.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Liberal Party (LP) leader
Ichiro Ozawa hinted Thursday that the LP might break away from the
coalition government if the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) fails
to follow through on agreements the two parties made when the
coalition was formed, press reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa met with Tamisuke Watanuki, head of the LDP's Keizo
Obuchi faction, to express his dissatisfaction over the LDP's
moves to include New Komeito, Japan's second largest opposition
party, as a third partner in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
"I do not understand why the LDP is putting priority on forming
a tripartite coalition," Ozawa was quoted as telling Watanuki.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa said the LDP must take steps toward realizing LDP-LP
agreements such as cooperation in elections and a cut in the
number of proportional representation seats in the House of
Representatives (lower house) before the end of the current Diet (
parliament) session on August 13.
</P>
<P>
The agreements between the LDP and LP calls for a reduction of
proportional representation seats from 200 to 150, a move the New
Komeito vehemently opposes.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rice Output Expected to Increase Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Better harvests are predicted to
push Indonesia's unhusked rice output to 49.53 million tons this
year from 49.24 million tons in 1998, according to the Central
Bureau of Statistics, quoted by The Jakarta Post Friday.
</P>
<P>
Corn production this year is forecast to reach 9.13 million
tons, down 10.17 percent from 10.66 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Soybean production is set to drop 2.34 percent to 1.28 million
tons this year from 1.31 million tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the forecast on unhusked rice was better than
its earlier prediction of 48.66 million tons due to the increase
in productivity.
</P>
<P>
However, Chairman of the Indonesian Farmers Association Siswono
Yudhohusodo warned that expected pest outbreaks during planting
season beginning in October would affect rice production.
</P>
<P>
"If the government does not take serious action to ease the
pest problems, we may see our rice production drop sharply again.
This could force us to double our import of rice to two million
tons," he said.

<HEADLINE> Lottery Plan Beneficial to Social Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Reform of the fund-raising welfare
lottery system to improve the country's social welfare services
and charity facilities will speed up, today's "China Daily"
reports.
</P>
<P>
The paper quotes Doje Cering, minister of civil affairs, as
saying that Chinese people are now showing increasing enthusiasm
to buy lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
Doje made the remarks at a national work conference on lottery
management held on Wednesday in Kunming, the capital of southwest
China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
He highly praised civil affairs officials at various levels for
their successful work in selling lottery tickets valued at 11
billion yuan (1.32 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
This included 5 billion yuan (600 million U.S. dollars) special
welfare lottery tickets to aid areas battered by last summer's
floods to reconstruct homes.
</P>
<P>
Through selling welfare lottery tickets, the ministry has
collected billions of yuan to aid residents in financial
difficulty, and to establish more public welfare facilities such
as rehabilitation centers and training schools for disabled people.
</P>
<P>
He said to improve the welfare lottery system, civil affair
officials should go all out to smooth out the wrinkles in the
management of the lottery system, enhance ways, including the use
of computers, to sell the tickets, keep close watch on market
demands and upgrade the quality of teams who sell the tickets.
</P>
<P>
Only lottery tickets issued by the State-approved official
institutions-the China Welfare Lottery Center and China Sports
Lottery Center - are legal, says the paper.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bank Agrees to Back Philippine Airlines Rehabilitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank has
agreed to withdraw its opposition to the rehabilitation of
cash-strapped Philippine Airlines (PAL), Philippine Daily Inquirer
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Rafael Buenaventura, governor of the
Philippine Central Bank, as saying Thursday that Eximbank will go
along with the rehabilitation plan under certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
"There is now an agreement in principle. So now we have to work
it out so that Eximbank will be satisfied that they are compliant
to those conditions," Buenaventura said.
</P>
<P>
An Eximbank mission met Thursday with PAL officials and
emissaries from the Philippine government to discuss the
withdrawal of the petition earlier filed by the bank with the U.S.
bankruptcy courts.
</P>
<P>
The bank has wanted to attach four PAL aircraft mortgaged by
the bleeding flag carrier.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura said Thursday's meeting was supposed to wrap up
all the discussions, which went on during the last two to three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, PAL chair Lucio Tan threatened to withdraw the 200
million U.S. dollars in fresh equity he recently infused into the
airline if Eximbank remained uncooperative.
</P>
<P>
Eximbank's decision to finally accept the rehabilitation plan
came after an assurance from both PAL management and the
Philippine government that the airline would be viable.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government, for its part, has assured Eximbank
that it would set the right environment for PAL's return to
profitability, not in terms of any tax subsidy but in reviewing
the open skies policy, which has hurt it in the past.
</P>
<P>
Regarding PAL's operations, Eximbank was given the assurance
that the sales projections would be realistic and that labor would
be cooperative.
</P>
<P>
PAL is carrying out a rehabilitation plan to pay its
2.2-billion-dollar debt after the company got the required
additional capital infusion of 200 million dollars on June 4.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government today
enforced its ban on publications on Falun Gong, which Chinese
authorities have said is an illegal organization that was
officially banned on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong was founded by Li Hongzhi, a Chinese national who
lives abroad, based on traditional Qigong exercises, which combine
meditation and breathing techniques to use one's vital force and
inner strength to improve health.
</P>
<P>
However, Li had ulterior motives and pronounced himself the
savior of the world and spread heretical, unscientific ideas among
Falun Gong practitioners. He also manipulated them and got them to
attack the news media and government departments, causing great
disruptions in the social order and seriously destabilizing
society.
</P>
<P>
The Press and Publications Administration in Beijing issued a
circular stating that no publications related to Falun Gong can be
reprinted, copied, or distributed, and that any publications on
Falun Gong that appear on the market are to be confiscated
immediately and publishers in China are to stop publishing books,
pictures, audio and video products, and electronic publications
related to Falun Gong, and newspapers and magazines are to stop
carrying articles or photos of Falun Gong activities.
</P>
<P>
The circular says that individuals are not allowed to print,
copy, distribute, or sell publications on Falun Gong and that any
violation of the ban will be dealt with in accordance with the law.

<P>
JAKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will begin its campaign
to host the 2006 Asian Games in Brunei Darussalam next month
during the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games.
</P>
<P>
National Sports Council (KONI) deputy of media and promotion
Ahmed Solichin said KONI would host a cocktail party on August 6
in Bandar Seri Begawan in Brunei. The party is expected to be
attended by the National Olympic Committee presidents from the 10
countries participating in the SEA Games, as well as officials
from the countries' sports federations.
</P>
<P>
"We will also set up a counter which will hold all the
information on Indonesia's bid for the Asiad. Two Miss Jakartas
will serve as guides to give information to all the visitors to
the counter," Ahmed was quoted by The Jakarta Post Friday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia aims to host the 2006 Asiad as part of its ambitious
Golden Garuda mega project which has as its goals moving Indonesia
into sixth position in the Asiad as well as hosting the event.
</P>
<P>
President B.J. Habibie has thrown his weight behind efforts to
land the Asiad and KONI has set up a team, chaired by Indra
Kartasasmita, to lead the effort. The team consists of top KONI
officials, sports organization officials, sports experts, top
officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Jakarta
City administration.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives Commission VII for education,
culture, religion youth affairs and sports has also supported the
bid.
</P>
<P>
KONI chose the National Monument (Monas) and the orangutan as
the symbols for its bid.
</P>
<P>
"We picked Monas because Jakarta is a candidate city for the
Asiad. Monas will be surrounded by five circles of different
colors symbolizing the five Olympic rings. We chose the orangutan
as the mascot because it looks funny, friendly and marketable," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia used the orangutan as its mascot during the 1998
Commonwealth Games.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed said KONI would campaign at several different events as
part of its efforts to land the 2006 Asiad.
</P>
<P>
First, it will campaign during the SEA Games. Then it will
campaign at the Olympic Committee of Asia (OCA) meeting in Kuwait
in November. Indonesia will also bid to host the OCA secretary-
general meeting and council meeting in 2000 in Bali as part of its
Asiad campaign.
</P>
<P>
OCA representatives will vote on who will host the 2006 Asiad
during its 2000 council meeting.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, KONI secretary-general Rudolf S. Warrouw said KONI had
provided 4 billion rupiah (597,000 U.S. dollars) to lobby members
of the OCA.
</P>
<P>
So far, Qatar, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Hong Kong of
China have registered to bid for the Asiad. Only Malaysia and Hong
Kong have begun to actively campaign. The United Arab Emirates
withdrew from the bidding.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica's Fiscal Deficit Shoots up in First 6 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's fiscal deficit
increased sharply in the first half of 1999, almost doubling that
of the same period last year, according to official figures
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit went up from 130 million U.S. dollars a year ago to
246 million dollars, caused mainly by a bad tax performance,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The deficit is likely to reach three percent of the country's
gross domestic product (GDP) by year end.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Leonel Baruch said the low level of income is
largely due to tax evasion. He proposed reforms to reinforce
taxation mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Huge internal debt also added to the deficit growth. The
statistics showed that the debt service has exceeded 264.8 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Modahl Hits Legal Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The international athlete, Diane
Modahl, has lost the latest stage of her marathon claim for
compensation against the sport's former governing body in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Following news of the setback, she withdrew from this weekend's
World Championship trials in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
The 800 meter runner has been diagnosed anemic. But she is also
suffering from stress as she continues to clear her name after
drug allegations.
</P>
<P>
Modahl is taking the British Athletic Federation (BAF) to court
after they banned her in 1994 for allegedly taking the performance
enhancing drug, testosterone.
</P>
<P>
The ban was later overturned, Modahl cleared her name and then
went back on the track.
</P>
<P>
But by that time she had been withdrawn from the 1994
Commonwealth Games and had no opportunity to defend the 800 meters
title she won four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
Modahl, who is 33, wants 480,000 pounds compensation from the
BAF to cover her legal and medical costs.
</P>
<P>
She is also claiming a similar sum in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
She had wanted to sue the BAF for acting on the findings of the
laboratory in Lisbon which detected testosterone in her urine
sample.
</P>
<P>
Modahl claimed that the lab was not accredited by international
athletic bodies and the BAF should not have acted on its findings.
</P>
<P>
The House of Lords has come out against her on that point but
her legal action still goes ahead .
</P>
<P>
Her remaining argument is that there was bias on the part of
two members of the original disciplinary committee which imposed
the four year ban.

<HEADLINE> Anelka Case "Threatens Clubs" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing transfer saga of
Nicolas Anelka may have disastrous consequences for football clubs,
Leicester City manager Martin O'Neill said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
His fears arise from the prospect of the "Anelka ruling" coming
into practice.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal's French striker, in order to free himself from the
club, has sought the advice of Belgian lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont --
the man who transformed the system of football transfers with the
Bosman ruling.
</P>
<P>
If Dupont is successful, it would mean that Anelka would be
able to buy out his Highbury contract for 900,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill believes that the new ruling could put a lot of clubs
out of business:
</P>
<P>
"If this goes through, then it will spell total disaster for
football," the Foxes boss said. "This could see clubs go to the
wall, everyone should be warned.
</P>
<P>
"The idea that someone could sign a five-year contract and then
buy themselves out at a drop of a hat is incredible. This ruling
would make contracts null and void.
</P>
<P>
"Players make a lot of money from it, but future generations
may not have football clubs to play for," added O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein, who has been at the focal
point of the Anelka transfer activities, said:
</P>
<P>
"If this happens we might as well hand the agents and the
players the key to the door."
</P>
<P>
If Anelka succeeds with his legal action then Dein could see a
20m asset leave the club for less than one million, but the vice-
chairman remains adamant on the choices available to his striker.
</P>
<P>
"Anelka has three possibilities: Arsenal, Juventus or going on
strike," he said.

<HEADLINE> Moravcova Among Absentees at European Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA,July 22 (Xinhua) -- Triple world short-course champion
Martina Moravcova will be absent from the European swimming
championships in Istanbul because of a thyroid problem, the
organizers said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
World and Olympic 100 meters breaststroke champion Frederik
DeBurghgraeve of Belgium, who didn't show up the last edition of
the championships in Seville in 1997, will again miss the event,
as he took the summer off to rest, the organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia's Moravcova, 23, training in the United States, won
three silver medals in Seville but claimed golds in the 200 meters
freestyle and 100 and 200 meters individual medley at the world
short-course championships in Hong Kong in April this year.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Emilio Brembilla, enjoying golden-double in Seville
with a 400 and 1,500 freestyle, will defend only the 400 in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The 11-day championships opened on Thursday with synchronized
swimming, world champion Olga Brusnikina of Russia setting the
early standard with 98.120 points in the solo technical
preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
The men's 10-meter platform diving starts on Friday and the
first two gold medals will be decided in the women's five
kilometers open-water race and the synchronised swimming solo
final.
</P>
<P>
The pool swimming begins on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Five Chinese Students to Attend Lucent's Global Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. communications system
giant Lucent Technologies said Thursday that 80 students from
around the world will attend its week-long global scholars
program.
</P>
<P>
The program, starting tomorrow, is designed to support students
who are interested in careers in information technology. The 80
students are from Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Japan, Mexico,
the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. Five of
them from China are four college students from Beijing and
Shanghai and one high school student.
</P>
<P>
According to Lucent, the program will focus on the important
role of communication in daily lives. The students will work with
researchers and scientists from Lucent's research and development
arm Bell Labs, various federal agencies, universities and their
peers to explore and develop blueprints for several communications
networks. U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley will join the
students on one day for a discussion on science and math
education.
</P>
<P>
Lucent launched the program last October, committing 10 million
U.S. dollars over the next 10 years, as a way to nurture some of
the world's brightest and most talented future engineers and
scientists, the company said.
</P>
<P>
The students were selected based on their overall academic
achievement, Lucent said. Along with being invited to the program,
they have already received an award of 5,000 dollars in
recognition of their selection. Most of them will also have the
opportunity to intern at Bell Labs while they are in college.

<HEADLINE> Pak Claims to Respond to Indian Violation of Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday said its army
has effectively responded to unprovoked cease-fire violation by
the Indian troops in the disputed area of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The Indian troops used artillery, mortar and automatic weapons
to indiscriminately target areas opposite to Drass, Mushkoh and
Batalik sub-sectors in Kargil during the last 48 hours, said a
Pakistani military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Pakistan army units deployed on the
Line of Control (LoC) gave "selective punishment" to the Indian
targets and inflicted "heavy losses" on the adversary.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that despite recent high level military
contacts, which had led to de-escalation in the LoC area by July
17, the Indian troops are repeatedly engaging in cease-fire
violation.
</P>
<P>
"We reserve the right to respond," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Director General Military Operations of Pakistan Thursday
contacted his Indian counterpart and raised the issue of
cease-fire violation by the Indian army, noted the spokesman.

drugs in sport.
</P>
<P>
It is part of the government's anti drug strategy co-ordinated

Banks wants to investigate ways in which sport can help drug
prevention, rehabilitation and social regeneration.
</P>
<P>
"I am increasingly concerned about the number of positive
doping tests in sport", said Banks.
</P>
<P>
"The United Kingdom leads the world in the fight against doping.
But that is no reason to stand still and admire our record.
</P>
<P>
"This group, helped by expert advice from independent
specialists, will make sure there are no hiding places for drug
cheats," he said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Likely to Loan Nigeria $1Bln </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) is poised to give Nigeria a one-billion-U.S. dollar
cushioning facility on certain conditions to help revive the
country's battered economy, Nigerian presidential spokesman said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The offer was made by IMF Deputy Managing Director Alassane
Ouattarra during the first visit by an IMF team since the May 29
hand-over from the military to civilian rule, President Olusegun
Obasanjo's spokesman Doyin Okupe said.
</P>
<P>
"He said the fund was willing to provide a one billion U.S.
dollar cushioning facility for Nigeria, if the country can put in
place a stand-by arrangement which will last a minimum of six and
a maximum of 12 months," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Okupe said that Obasanjo had agreed to accept a resident World
Bank official to act as a liaison officer with his government.
</P>
<P>
"President Obasanjo called on the Nigerian people to be ready
to make the necessary sacrifices for the collective good of the
nation," he added.
</P>
<P>
An agreement with the IMF and a good track record of economic
management is vital for Nigeria to secure relief on its
30-billion-dollar foreign debts, which have made Nigeria's further
development impossible.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Recruits More Patrol Boats to Combat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
through the World Bank-backed Lake Victoria Environmental
Management Program (LVEMP) has purchased another 19 speed patrol
boats to curb environmental pollution and poison fishing in the
lake.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism, Zakia Meghji,
said this Thursday in the central city of Dodoma. She added that
the purchase brings the number of patrol boat in the lake to 25.
</P>
<P>
Meghji said that the government is determined to end the
practice of fishing with chemical substance in the lake and has
contracted the Tanzania People's Defense Force navy unit to search
for a big vessel in the international market.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing everything possible to wipe out the poison
fishing in the Lake Victoria to enable the country to earn its
rightful income by exporting fish fillets to the lucrative
European Union (EU) market," she said in a telephone interview
with Daily News.
</P>
<P>
Apart from purchasing the speed patrol boats, the government
invited EU officials last month to help test about 177 samples of
fillets and water from the lake in both local and foreign
laboratories, she said.
</P>
<P>
The tests, witnessed by the officials, all proved that the
samples poison free, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"On winding up their working tour in the country the EU
officials told me that they are satisfied with the efforts made by
the government in curbing poison fishing and they will recommend
to the relevant EU bodies to lift the ban on our fish fillets
exports," she said.
</P>
<P>
On March 30, EU announced a ban on imports of fresh and frozen
fish products from Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda following reports
that unscrupulous people had been using pesticides for cotton in
fishing activities.
</P>
<P>
After that, Tanzania has taken stern measures against illegal
fishing activities in the lake.
</P>
<P>
The ban means a daily loss of 78.1 millions shillings (about
97,600 U.S. dollars) in foreign exchange earnings to Tanzania. A
number of people on the lake have lost jobs and fish fillets
prices have nose-dived from 850 (about 1.1 dollars) shillings to
250 shillings one kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The minister appealed to the EU to lift the ban as soon as
possible since poison fishing practices have been put under
control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is reported that Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye has written the EU to inform the efforts made by
the government in safeguarding the cleanliness of fish fillets.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique said here Thursday that
it is dissatisfied with the way in which Harare repatriated some
600 Mozambicans accused of "illegal mining" in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
Cooperation said: "The Mozambican government was not happy with
the method of repatriation of Mozambicans by the Zimbabwean
authorities because it was against the mechanism agreed by the two
states on resolution to such problems."
</P>
<P>
The Radio Mozambique reported that the repatriation started
last weekend and Zimbabwe employed special police, dogs, horses
and trucks.
</P>
<P>
Most of the returned Mozambicans are from southern Gaza
Province, but they have been repatriated at Machipanda border in
central Manica Province, said the release.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zimbabwean ambassador to Maputo said that the
repatriation was aimed at criminals including Zimbabwean criminals
instead of decent citizens.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador admitted that some police officers did make some
mistakes as they did not inform and contact with the Mozambican
departments concerned.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean envoy has promised to take appropriate measures
to avoid such incidents later, according to the press release.

ADDIS ABABA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi Thursday complained that the international community has
not done much to peacefully resolve the conflict between his
country and Eritrea.

<P>
Meles made the remarks in meeting visiting British
parliamentary delegation here.
</P>
<P>
While the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has done all in
its capacity to bring a diplomatic solution to the Ethio-Eritrean
conflict, the developed nations have not played a significant role
to settle the crisis through peaceful means, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meles said he does not believe that the Eritrean government
would fully accept and implement the modalities for the
implementation of OAU framework agreement on the settlement of the
dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

Border disputes resulted in an outbreak of bloody conflict

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency Warns of Worsening Child Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The health of children
across the planet is more precarious today than a decade ago when
ambitious goals were set for the defeat of many childhood
illnesses, a U.N. agency said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An international push is needed to ensure that the globe's six
billionth baby to be born this year will grow up free of polio,
according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The polio eradication effort costing about 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars yearly still needs some 500 million dollars to achieve the
goal by 2000, said UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy when
launching UNICEF annual report of The Progress of Nations 1999.
</P>
<P>
Ongoing civil conflicts are threatening the campaign against
polio and persistent poverty is draining public health resources
in polio-affected countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
The report also highlighted the growing challenges posed by
HIV/AIDS in the developing world where there are 8.2 million AIDS
orphans.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, the report said, there are currently 1.1 million
children under the age of 15 who have been orphaned through AIDS,
an 11 percent of Uganda's child population.
</P>
<P>
Children's prospects will also be deeply limited by the burden
of debt. A child in the developing world is born bearing an
average debt obligation of 417 dollars, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa spends more on servicing its over 200
billion dollars debt than on the health and education of its 306
million children.
</P>
<P>
"The global economy is now worth nearly 30 trillion dollars,
but 650 million children -- more than twice the U.S. population --
still live in the grip of absolute poverty," the UNICEF chief
said.
</P>
<P>
"Debt relief and debt cancellation are a first step to ensuring
hundreds of millions of children and women in developing countries
their right to health and education," Bellamy added.

UNITED NATIONS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Thursday urged all parties concerned in Congo (K) to cease
hostilities throughout the central African country before and
during the first polio vaccination round on August 8-20.
</P>
<P>
He said that he trusts that a peaceful and secure environment
will be provided to give all children under the age of five in
Congo (K) from the crippling disease of polio, the feared
childhood disease that is close to being eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief reiterated his March 9 statement, in which he
called for "days of tranquillity" in Congo (K) to allow for the
polio immunization campaign to cover some 10 million children
under the age of five.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution on April 9 this
year, urging all parties to respect a truce and support the
vaccination campaign.
</P>
<P>
President Laurent Kabila of Congo (K) has voiced his commitment
to support the vaccination drive and the willingness expressed by
the leadership of Congo (K) Rally for Democracy (RCD) to the U.N.
special representative for children and armed conflicts to
facilitate the campaign.
</P>
<P>
U.N. agencies, in particular the United Nations Children's Fund
and the World Health Organization, along with other humanitarian
partners, are proceeding with preparation for the vaccination
campaign in Congo (K).

The first round is scheduled to start on August 13. Two more
rounds are scheduled for September.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Budget Surplus Totals 53.57 Billion Dollars in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Treasury Department said
Thursday that the U.S. budget surplus last month totaled 53.57
billion dollars, up slightly from the 51.11 billion surplus
recorded in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The new recorded budget surplus in June partly reflected the
flow of money into the U.S. Treasury from quarterly corporate
income tax payments.
</P>
<P>
Corporate tax payments totaled 39.26 billion dollars in June
while individual income tax receipts totaled 92.99 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of fiscal 1999, which began Oct. 1,
1998, the government surplus totaled 94.28 billion dollars, up
from 67.07 billion dollars for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is forecasting a surplus of 99
billion dollars for all of 1999, and congressional accountants are
predicting a surplus of about 120 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The May revised deficit remained 23.97 billion dollars, the
Treasury Department said.
</P>
<P>
In June, government receipts totaled 199.48 billion dollars,
compared with 187.86 billion dollars a year earlier. Outlays
totaled 145.91 billion dollars in June, up from 136.75 billion
dollars for June 1998.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Adviser: Kosovar Serbs Must Have Equal Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN July 22 (Xinhua)--A senior adviser to German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder on Thursday said the Serbs in Kosovo must be
treated equally as the Albanians and they must enjoy same rights
in the same region.
</P>
<P>
Michael Steiner, Schroeder's consultant for foreign affairs,
gave the speech to a Berlin radio one day before the Chancellor's
visit to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The critical point of the mission is just what the (German)
federal government has expected from the very beginning--it also
involves those who have been the majority but now are minority,"
said Steiner.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs living in Kosovo, or having lived there, must
"naturally obtain their human rights," he stressed, adding:" all
those who had to flee must be able to return now."
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Steiner, Schroeder is due to visit the war-torn
region, where thousands of Serbs were reportedly fleeing after
Yugoslav forces retreated.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's Kosovo schedule will include talks with Kosovar
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and the rebelling UCK commander
Hashim Thaci. The visit is aimed to make preparation for the
Balkan summit on July 30.

<HEADLINE> Britain Seeks Closer Relations With Russia After Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook on Thursday signaled a fresh start to the relations between
Britain and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"This visit does mark a step change in our relations. We want a
new and stronger relationship for the new millennium," Cook told a
news conference after talks with his Russian counterpart Igor
Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
Cook said he hoped to visit Russia soon to address the Duma,
the lower house of parliament, and clear the way for a possible
visit by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has made one brief
trip to Moscow since assuming office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Blair, who also met Mr Ivanov, was expected to visit Russia
next year after an invitation by President Boris Yeltsin's
government.
</P>
<P>
"When it (a Blair visit) will be possible I don't know but we
are actively looking at it," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary said the UK would take a positive and
constructive approach at an International Monetary Fund (IMF)
meeting next week to consider further lending to Russia.
</P>
<P>
"This visit has given us in Britain the opportunity to extend
the hand of friendship to Russia and to provide a signal of our
full engagement with Russia in tackling global issues," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov arrived London on Wednesday, on a visit that was to have
taken place in May, but was cancelled by President Yeltsin in
protest at NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Although Cook pulled out the rhetorical stops to give the
impression that things were now back on track, Ivanov was more
reserved and made clear Kosovo was still a subject of potential
friction.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Minister stressed that differences remained
over Kosovo, saying Russia believed Yugoslavia should be given
reconstruction aid.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Fears Losing Polio Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Children's Fund
(UNICEF) warned Thursday that wars and lack of money could make it
hard to win the campaign to curb polio, the feared childhood
disease that is close to being eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Many children under the age of five can not be reached because
of conflicts, particular in Africa. Countries such as Angola,
Congo (K) and Sudan face serious outbreaks of polio because
fighting has forced the suspension of immunization efforts in many
areas, UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
The price tag for completing the eradication of polio is 1.25
billion U.S. dollars, and 750 million U.S. dollars has already
been pledged. That leaves 527 days to raise 500 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
At one time, polio killed or crippled 500,000 people a year,
mostly children. When the World Health Organization (WHO) set the
goal in 1988 0f eliminating polio by the end of 2000, there were
35,000 cases annually.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 450 million children were vaccinated against polio
and there were 6,000 cases, concentrated in 13 countries in
Africa, Asia and the Middle East, according to the Progress of
Nations 1999 report.
</P>
<P>
"Victory is actually achingly close," Bellamy told a press
conference held to launch the report.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF report included a new list of countries where
children are most at risk. Topping the list are nations in
conflict, including Angola, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Somalia,
Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Niger, Congo (K), Burundi and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Childrens are least at risk in the industrialized world, Cuba
and Libya.
