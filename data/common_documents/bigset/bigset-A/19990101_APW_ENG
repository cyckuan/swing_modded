<HEADLINE> Former NBC Chairman Adams Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Adams, a former NBC chairman who was  
regarded as one of television's most popular executives, has died. 
He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams died Sunday at Cedar Manor Nursing Home in Ossining, N.Y.,  
located north of New York City in Westchester County. He was a 
resident of nearby Croton-on-Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the network's legal staff in 1947, after working for  
the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, D.C., and 
serving in the Army. He went on to assume responsibility for the 
network's legal department, its Washington office, program 
standards and practices, research and planning, advertising, 
publicity and promotion, and relations with affiliated stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a leave from NBC in 1969, when he was senior executive  
vice president, Adams returned as a member of the company's board 
and as executive vice president of its corporate staff. He was 
appointed chairman in the early 1970s and served as vice chairman 
from 1975 until his retirement in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Ilyana, of Croton-on-Hudson; a  
step-daughter, Kristina Lanin-Stufano of Hamden, Conn.; a 
daughter-in-law, Audrey Adams of Scarsdale; two grandchildren and 
two step-grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Look at Leading Democrats for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A brief look at potential Democratic presidential candidates in  
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	--Al Gore, 50, former member of both the House and the Senate  
from Tennessee, and vice president since 1993. He is considered the 
front-runner for the nomination. He ran unsuccessfully in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dick Gephardt, 57, House minority leader from Missouri. He shot  
to national prominence in 1988 when he won the Iowa caucuses and 
finished second in the New Hampshire primary, before later dropping 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bill Bradley, 55, basketball star, Rhodes scholar and former  
senator from New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	--Paul Wellstone, 54, former college professor and current  
senator from Minnesota. He is a critic of the Clinton 
administration's centrist philosophy and has set himself up as an 
alternative to Gore in much the same way another Minnesota senator, 
Eugene McCarthy, challenged Lyndon Johnson 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	--John Kerry, 55, is a Vietnam War hero and 14-year senator from  
Massachusetts. His re-election battle in 1996 against former Gov. 
William F. Weld became a nationally watched race. Kerry won by 7 
percentage points -- a big enough margin to spark talk of a 
presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jesse Jackson, 57, the nation's best-known civil rights leader,  
is considering a third run for the nomination. He ran 
unsuccessfully in 1984 and 1988.

<HEADLINE> Parties, Fireworks Greet 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Prayers for rain. A frantic dig through tons of snow for missing  
loved ones. Desperate hopes for good luck from those seeking more 
to eat. 
</P>
<P>
	While giddy crowds jammed the world's largest cities to  
celebrate New Year's Day with extravagant fireworks displays and 
raucous street parties, hopes that 1999 would truly be a better 
year were fervent in less glamorous areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of Afghans, worried sick about a drought, offered  
special prayers Friday for rain and snow in a desert outside of the 
war-ruined capital of Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
	Fireworks soared above the cheering crowds in Moscow's Red  
Square, where lights played on the Kremlin and the curved domes of 
St. Basil's Cathedral. But the millions who depend on the city's 
subway system were hit with a 30 percent increase in ticket prices 
Friday -- the latest evidence of their sharply declining living 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all celebrations were joyous -- nor all wishes for good  
fortune answered. Over 260 people were injured in the Philippines 
as they lighted firecrackers to scare away bad luck. A footbridge 
collapsed during a fireworks celebration in Valparaiso, Chile, 
leaving two dead and 90 injured. 
</P>
<P>
	And an avalanche crashed down upon an Inuit village in northern  
Quebec, killing at least six people and injuring 25 during a New 
Year's party. Snow up to nine feet thick piled up inside the hall, 
burying several people. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, youths frolicked in the Fountain of Wealth as it  
shot jets of water 90 feet high to welcome in the Year of the 
Rabbit. Their wishes were for an end to the Asian economic crisis, 
which has caused a recession in Singapore and left millions 
elsewhere in dire poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	This day, like no other, inspired speeches from world leaders.  
</P>
<P>
	In his last New Year's address as president, Nelson Mandela  
called on South Africans to work together to end poverty and 
corruption. Malaysia Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad -- returning to 
a favorite theme -- blasted the Western currency speculators he 
blamed for the country's economic ills. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaclav Havel, the former dissident-turned-president of the Czech  
Republic, used his New Year's Day message to warn of spreading 
xenophobia and nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have pulled down the huge wall separating us from Western  
democracies ... but we are slowly building new walls among 
ourselves,'' Havel said Friday in Prague. ``Many forget that the 
measure of democracy is the treatment of minorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pope John Paul II held his first Mass of the year Friday before  
thousands filling St. Peter's Basilica. Thousands more crowded the 
vast square outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secret of true peace is in respect of human rights,'' he  
declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven European nations embraced 1999 with a unified currency --  
the euro. The historic shift kept legions of financial workers 
cloistered in office buildings over the holiday weekend, working to 
get ready for Monday's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, tens of thousands jammed Trafalgar Square to cheer  
wildly as Big Ben rang out 1998. More than 6,000 American 
cheerleaders and musicians marched in the city's parade. 
</P>
<P>
	Paris was indeed ``the city of lights,'' as 500,000 revelers  
sauntered up the elegant Champs-Elysees under rows of trees etched 
in with white lights. 
</P>
<P>
	Dancers, singers and musicians rocked Berlin with an open-air  
party before a midnight fireworks show. The city had much to 
celebrate -- for in 1999 Berlin once again becomes the capital of a 
united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Some New Year's traditions were just plain odd: India and  
Pakistan, bitter rivals, exchanged information on each other's 
nuclear facilities, a ritual that dates to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	And inmates in Brazil celebrated in their own way: 106 of them  
broke out of overcrowded prisons in Rio and Sao Paulo.

<HEADLINE> Fireworks Kill Two in New Orleans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Fireworks being loaded onto a barge exploded  
minutes before the craft was to be towed into the Mississippi River 
for a New Year's Eve display, killing two workers and severely 
burning a sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tugboat workers found the deputy running around the dock area,  
his clothes in flames. They doused him with water before rescue 
workers arrived, said Terry Thibodeaux, assistant chief of the 
Harvey Volunteer Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of Thursday night's explosion was not known.  
</P>
<P>
	The blast involved as many as 200 shells and several hundred  
pounds of explosives, authorities said. The show, which was to have 
been viewed by an estimated 100,000 people, was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin Banks, spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  
Firearms, said two men died. Their names were not made public, but 
officials said both worked for Classic Fireworks By Events Inc., 
the company handling the event. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were about to shove off on the barge owned by McDonough  
Marine Service when the explosion happened at about 8:30 p.m. in 
suburban Harvey. The barge was to cruise into the river off the 
French Quarter for the pyrotechnics show. 
</P>
<P>
	The off-duty Jefferson Parish deputy sheriff was being paid to  
work at the event. A sheriff's spokesman said Sgt. Eddie Benoit, a 
15-year veteran, was in the hospital with second- and third-degree 
burns over half his body. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks said there were no witnesses, so they have few details  
about the size of the explosion or what happened, but it appeared 
there was a single explosion and no fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks said the workers were experienced professionals.  
</P>
<P>
	``But any time you get into fireworks, and other explosive  
materials, anything can happen,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Revelers Stock Up for Next New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The party's a year away, but you might  
want to stock up now on the bubbly. 
</P>
<P>
	With 1999 still in its infancy, some wine merchants are already  
predicting a shortage of fine champagne for next New Year's as 
revelers snap up bottles for the biggest party in 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the millennium doesn't technically end until Dec. 31,  
2000, many people are planning big parties for Dec. 31, 1999. The 
anticipated rush on champagne is causing anxiety among some 
vintners. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you think about the billions of people who are going to  
want to pull a cork next New Year's Eve, there's not going to be 
enough to go around,'' said Peter Morrell, chairman of Morrell &AMP; 
Co., a New York City fine wine shop and mail order business. 
</P>
<P>
	Many dealers started worrying about a shortage several weeks  
ago, when champagne sales for New Year's Eve 1998 skyrocketed over 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Group, a holding and distribution company based in  
West Bridgewater, Mass., this week was unable to fill orders for 
hundreds of cases of premium champagne such as Dom Perignon and 
Moet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just physically didn't have (the champagne),'' said David  
Roberts, chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts, whose holiday champagne sales were up 15 percent to 20  
percent in 1998, said he had to scour the company warehouse 
Thursday to find two bottles of high-end champagne for his own New 
Year's Eve celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is for real -- demand exceeding supply,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Champagne aficionados say the demand is being driven by several  
factors: a robust economy, increased interest in fine wines and 
plans for grand celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Champagne producers have sought to whip up enthusiasm through  
slick advertising campaigns aimed at making consumers feel that 
having premium champagne is a must at any celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American public is beginning to respond -- whether they  
know it or not -- to the advertisements and promotions, which are 
being conducted very effectively by these producers,'' said Rich 
Cartiere, publisher and editor of Wine Market Report, a trade 
newsletter based in Calistoga, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Some store owners say customers who are anticipating the rush on  
champagne for New Year's Eve 1999 doubled up on their 1998 holiday 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are starting to put it away for next year,'' said  
George Robotti, manager of Star Wines &AMP; Spirits in Stamford. 
``We've been told (by distributors) that there's going to be a very 
limited amount for next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although most consumers lump French champagne together with  
California sparkling wines, real champagne wines come exclusively 
from a small region in northeastern France. 
</P>
<P>
	The Champagne Wines Information Bureau, a trade group that  
promotes the wines of La Champagne, France, says worries about a 
shortage are exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Louis Carbonnier, director of the group, said producers are  
confident they will have enough to meet consumers' needs, with an 
estimated 300 million bottles ready to ship. He acknowledged that 
some select brands may be in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wine experts agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some very prestigious, high-end French champagnes will run  
out, but overall you'll be able to find just about any French 
champagne you want by the end of (1999),'' Cartiere said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are finding a shortage right now because the producers are  
holding back stock because they want to have some for (1999).''

<HEADLINE> Investors Cautious About 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't look too closely for wild celebrations on  
Wall Street as 1999 gets under way. 
</P>
<P>
	The harrowing dips in the market last year left their mark on  
investors, and many are cautious about the year ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mood with investors is like a soldier coming back from  
battle -- a much wiser soldier,'' said Russ Labrasca, national sales 
manager at State Street Research, a Boston mutual fund company. 
``Many of them have a new respect for risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three main stock market indicators posted their  
unprecedented fourth straight year of double-digit gains. The Dow 
Jones average rose 16.1 percent, ending the year at 9,181, the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 gained 26.7 percent, and the Nasdaq gained a 
startling 39.6 percent. Of the Dow's 200 highest closes of all 
time, 192 came in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But for many new investors, last summer's selloff was a jarring  
introduction to sharp market swings. On 16 occasions, the sharp 
price swings left the Dow more than 200 points higher or lower in a 
single day. 
</P>
<P>
	Online investor Charles Burroughs of Denver, who visited the New  
York Stock Exchange on Thursday, said 1998's market swings left him 
feeling dazed. 
</P>
<P>
	``While you have money, you're on a big high, and you wake up in  
October with no money. Then you wake up again, and it's all back,'' 
he said. ``It was all the way up, it was all the way down -- if 
you're lucky enough, you're even now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even investing pros were unsettled. Especially worrisome for  
them was the recent frenzy over Internet-related companies. Stocks 
of online retailers like Amazon.com have soared to seemingly 
unsustainable heights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometime we are going to have to pay back some of this. It  
just doesn't stay this way forever,'' said Edward Collins, a trader 
at Daiwa Securities America in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The year started off looking a lot like the three years before  
it, which all produced double-digit gains in the Dow. The Dow 
romped through record after record in the first half of the year, 
peaking on July 17 just as the global financial crisis flared 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	In just six weeks, the measure of 30 major blue-chip companies  
tumbled 19.3 percent. The Asian financial crisis spread to Latin 
America, Russia defaulted on its debt and U.S. companies started 
feeling the pinch. 
</P>
<P>
	Was it a bear market? Market watchers can't seem to agree. The  
classical definition of a bear market is a decline of 20 percent, 
so some say that the Dow's decline just missed it -- which means 
Wall Street's eight-year bull run is still going. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a strong recovery this fall in blue-chip companies and  
the big players in the S&AMP;P 500 index, many smaller company stocks 
remain in negative territory for the year. And the Russell 2000 
index of smaller companies closed down for the year, its first 
losing year since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say it was the best year for the market,'' Carlos  
Carela, a broker clerk for Lehman Brothers, said while taking a 
cigarette break outside the stock exchange. ``With the volatility 
it's so risky.''

<HEADLINE>  Arkansas Coach Warns About Michigan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Houston Nutt has heard it over and over  
again, but he still doesn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters, fans, players talk about the speed of the Arkansas  
Razorbacks, and the edge that should provide today in their Citrus 
Bowl matchup against a burly Michigan squad. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people think, `Oh, they're Michigan. They're going to  
be big, tough,''' the rookie Arkansas coach said Thursday. ``But if 
you really watch them, they're fast. They're faster than you 
think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 11 Razorbacks (9-2) and the No. 15 Wolverines (9-3) meet  
for the first time in a bowl where neither team has played. 
Statistically, they are nearly an even match, but Nutt says that 
won't matter come game time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Win the turnover margin,'' Nutt said as he prepared to walk  
his team through the Citrus Bowl. ``I think that's the big key.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is much more at stake for both teams than a victory in a  
second-tier bowl that has lost some of its luster in the shadow of 
the four-game bowl championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas is playing in its first New Year's Day bowl in eight  
years, coming off miserable 4-7 records in the last two seasons. A 
victory over Michigan would bring credibility to the program, which 
boasts the seventh-best rushing defense in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan is spending its final day as defending champions.  
Back-to-back losses to Notre Dame and Syracuse to open the season 
eliminated any hopes the Wolverines had to try to repeat. Yet they 
strung together eight consecutive victories to salvage the season 
and take a share of the Big Ten title. 
</P>
<P>
	``This group had their own challenges and their own adversity,''  
coach Lloyd Carr said. ``I think we look at (the Citrus Bowl) as an 
opportunity to finish the season in a way in which we can leave 
feeling good about this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A win would give Michigan 10 victories this season and keep it  
among the ranks of the perennial powers. A loss would mean the 
Wolverines have lost four games in five of their past six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Razorbacks will undoubtedly be aggressive in their attack on  
Wolverines quarterback Tom Brady, who is relatively inexperienced 
and not very quick. Still, he is only 302 yards shy of the school's 
single-season passing record. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try to give him a lot of different looks, try  
to apply pressure, just mix things up,'' Nutt said. 
</P>
<P>
	To balance its offense, Michigan will need a big game out of  
running back Anthony Thomas, who finished the regular season with a 
career-high 183 yards and four scores against Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensively, Arkansas has several weapons.  
</P>
<P>
	Tailbacks Madre Hill and Chrys Chukwuma combined for 1,539 yards  
rushing, and quarterback Clint Stoerner threw for an average of 239 
yards. His favorite target is Anthony Lucas, who averaged 23.3 
yards a catch with a school-record 1,004 receiving yards. He 
recently missed some practice with a hip pointer but said he was 
ready for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told coach Nutt and the training staff I can't miss this  
game for the whole world,'' Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The task of defending the Razorbacks is daunting, Carr said.  
</P>
<P>
	``You know you can't afford to stack up against the run, because  
they can hurt you with the big pass. Yet you have to be able to 
stop the run,'' he said.

<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- The state of Alaska marks its birthday  
Sunday, 40 years since a remote, thinly populated territory 
overcame skepticism from the Lower 48 and became equal to every 
other state in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The statehood struggle may now be the stuff of history books,  
but some of the same conflicts with the federal government that 
drove that quest remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Becoming a state took some time and many trips to Washington.  
But in the end statehood supporters made their case, and on Jan. 3, 
1959, Alaska's became the 49th star on Old Glory. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 215,000 people who lived in Alaska at the time,  
statehood meant freedom from the indignity of not being able to 
vote in presidential elections, from being forced to pass through 
U.S. Customs upon arrival in the Lower 48, from having governmental 
decisions made thousands of miles away in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all comes back to resources,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens,  
R-Alaska. ``And it's going to remain a problem for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens, now 75, was part of the 1950s statehood struggle as a  
young Interior Department lawyer in charge of the agency's 
relations with Congress. Once the Eisenhower administration lined 
up behind statehood, he became the middleman for determined 
Alaskans making the two-day flight to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Gov. Walter Hickel, then a go-getting Anchorage  
developer, says he made at least a dozen trips East to lobby. It 
didn't take long to figure out whom he had to convince. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really the senior members of the Senate that gave us  
what we needed,'' recalled Hickel, now 79. ``You had to get the 
seniority to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska won in Congress by a comfortable margin in 1958 and  
thought it was getting out from under the federal thumb when it 
came to its resources. To Alaskans, that meant land -- the right to 
hunt and fish on it, access to mine it and drill it, the desire to 
preserve it in its natural state. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of land in Alaska is not the problem. How it's used  
is. The new state government was granted about 28 percent of the 
land -- an area larger than California. The federal government, 
however, kept 64 percent of Alaska, just as it controls large 
sections of many Western states. The rest is private or 
native-owned. 
</P>
<P>
	The statehood deal called for much of the federal land to be  
opened to resource development, with the state getting 90 percent 
of the revenue generated. But over the years, as environmental 
protection became a greater value to Americans, more and more of 
the federal land has been closed off to development. 
</P>
<P>
	Billions of barrels of oil could lie under the Arctic National  
Wildlife Refuge, but the area is off-limits to drilling. Logging 
has been cut back sharply in the Tongass National Forest in recent 
years and many gold miners seethe about rules that make it hard to 
even cross federal land to reach their claims. 
</P>
<P>
	More wilderness and park land has cheered Alaska's growing  
legion of conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to realize that 60 percent of Alaska belongs to all of  
the people in the United States, including us, and we don't have 
jurisdiction over these lands,'' said Claus Naske, a statehood 
expert at the University of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	But that view isn't held by the state government, which in 1993  
filed a $29 billion lawsuit against the federal government for lost 
revenue and other damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a few battles and we'll win 'em,'' said Hickel, who  
filed the lawsuit. ``But we have to fight 'em.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government has also riled many Alaskans with its  
threat to take over most of the state's fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has insisted that the state  
match federal law by giving those who fish and hunt for subsistence 
purposes first shot. Alaska legislators have refused to change the 
state law, which gives everyone equal access, and has sued the 
federal government over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Also as it did in 1959, the state is struggling with how to pay  
its bills. Alaska still remains heavily dependent on natural 
resources. Back then salmon was king; now it's oil. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many ways we're still a colonial economy,'' Naske said.  
``Most of what we produce goes to the contiguous states and 
elsewhere for processing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for those who were there for the front end of statehood, the  
vision they held in January 1959 lives on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not disillusioned at all,'' Hickel said. ``I say it's  
going to be great. We just have to make it work.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: End Destructive Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) -- President Clinton opened 1999  
with a note of optimism and a midnight kiss for his wife. He called 
on Washington to ``move away from the politics of personal 
destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No overt reminder of his political peril darkened the dawn of  
the new year for Clinton, even as the Senate is poised to weigh 
articles of impeachment against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking some two dozen questions on New Year's Eve -- first in a  
dialogue with teens and 20-somethings at the Renaissance Weekend 
intellectual retreat, then in written submissions from their 
parents -- Clinton did not receive a single query on the House votes 
to impeach him or a possible Senate trial to remove him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The president himself came closer than any questioners to  
addressing those issues stemming from his actions in the Monica 
Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, asked about the Republicans' 1994 ``Contract With  
America,'' sounded almost wistful for the days when issues divided 
the political parties. The aggressive GOP legislative agenda may 
have won Republicans House control in 1994, but the public backlash 
two years later got him re-elected, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wanted Democrats and Republicans in Washington to get  
back to a vigorous debate of issues such as Social Security reform 
and ``move away from the politics of personal destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's off-the-cuff comments in the two private,  
invitation-only sessions were relayed to reporters by White House 
spokeswoman Amy Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the youngsters asked Clinton, at the uncertain midpoint  
of his second term, what he had learned about life. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he's more optimistic than when he took office in 1993  
about the capacity of the American people to make changes and the 
ability of the government to help people improve their lives,'' 
Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton answered many of the same  
questions put to her husband. Asked how she wanted to be remembered 
by history, Mrs. Clinton referred to earlier in the evening when 
the emcee jokingly wondered how the heck a Wellesley grad ever 
landed in Vogue magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to worry about a legacy, I've been on the cover  
of Vogue,'' Mrs. Clinton laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelsea Clinton, on a holiday break from her sophomore year at  
Stanford University, accompanied her parents on the 48-hour retreat 
to this resort island. 
</P>
<P>
	The president made an early-morning tee time New Year's Day, and  
watched his beloved Arkansas Razorbacks fall 45-to-31 to Michigan 
in the Florida Citrus Bowl. He later flew back to Washington and 
returned to the White House late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He would use his weekly radio address Saturday to paint a broad  
outline of his new budget plans, Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranging widely in Thursday night's discussion, Clinton decried  
the ability of extremists to plague the Middle East peace process, 
endorsed offering foreign languages to students as early as 
elementary school, touted his administration's accomplishments and 
said young people should be encouraged to go into teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	On reforming Social Security, he said he either will offer a  
specific plan or encourage the House and Senate to agree on a 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The countdown to midnight ended the organized talk. The Clintons  
shared a kiss and joined in singing ``Auld Lang Syne,'' Weiss said.

<HEADLINE> Birth Troubles for Over-40 Moms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Complications and interventions during birth  
are more prevalent among women 40 and older than previously 
believed, according to a new study touted as the most extensive of 
its kind. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-seven percent of first-time mothers in their 40s had a  
Caesarean section -- twice as many as women in their 20s, according 
to the study of 24,032 California women, hospital records and birth 
certificate data. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies have shown that 35 percent of California women  
in their 40s have a Caesarean section in their first pregnancy. 
Nationwide, that number is 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time accurate numbers can be attributed to  
some of the complications of labor and pregnancy'' for the older 
women, said Dr. William Gilbert of the University of California, 
Davis, the lead author of the study to be published today in the 
journal Obstetrics &AMP; Gynecology. 
</P>
<P>
	Among women in their 40s who gave birth in 1992 and 1993, the  
rates of pregnancy-related diabetes and high blood pressure also 
were substantially higher than in mothers in their 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	About 7 percent of older mothers suffered gestational diabetes,  
a serious complication of pregnancy, regardless of whether the baby 
was their first. That rate was about four times higher than that of 
younger mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Older mothers also had a more prolonged and difficult labor, and  
their babies were more likely to be premature or be underweight, 
according to the study detailed in today's Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, researchers said older women shouldn't necessarily be  
dissuaded from having children. 
</P>
<P>
	``The take-home message is that while a lot of complications of  
labor and pregnancy are increased for women in their 40s, the vast 
majority of them do perfectly fine,'' Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Susheela Singh, research director at the Alan Guttmacher  
Institute, a New York think tank for reproductive issues, said the 
study should help doctors and older mothers anticipate some medical 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the study is ``more convincing than other studies''  
because it uses a larger and better sample of women, she said.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Forbes Lead GOP 2000 Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush's celebrity and  
billionaire Steve Forbes' money may give them an early edge among a 
crowded field of potential Republican candidates for president in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the first presidential primary is more than a year away, so  
there is ample time for any contender to rise or fall -- or both. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forbes and Bush have to be considered the top tier  
candidates'' based on their advantages, said Leslie Goodman, a 
California-based GOP consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there's still a long distance to go between now and the  
spring when the field will begin to gel. I wouldn't close out the 
field yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a big field it is.  
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander has built strong  
organizations in the early primary states and Sen. John Ashcroft of 
Missouri would be a good bet among the long shots. Dan Quayle 
already has had ``president'' as part of his job title. Jack Kemp 
was the party's 1996 vice presidential nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, the maverick Arizona senator and Vietnam War  
hero, will campaign as an anti-Washington politician who works in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, the House budget chairman, could catch  
fire under the right conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Quayle and Ashcroft, who is still undecided about  
whether he will run but will announce his plans Tuesday, other 
social conservatives likely to run are activist Gary Bauer, 
broadcaster Pat Buchanan, Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire and radio 
talk show host Alan Keyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dark horse Republicans who are not likely to seek the nomination  
but could enliven the race include retiring House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich, American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole and New York 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Though he says he will not run, former Gen. 
Colin Powell belongs in this category in case he changes his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, with perhaps the highest profile among the 31 Republican  
chief state executives, is not the only governor considering a bid 
for president. George Pataki of New York, Tommy Thompson of 
Wisconsin and Pete Wilson of California also could join the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush wears the mantle of front-runner, if only by name  
recognition, although it may not be fair to use that label so early 
in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the son of former President Bush and brother of the  
incoming Florida governor, Jeb. He won re-election in November by a 
landslide, racking up impressive numbers among women, Hispanics and 
independent voters. Yet he is largely unknown on the national scene 
and untested. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush will decide in the spring whether to run. If the answer is  
yes, he must decide whether to accept federal matching money for 
the race. There is talk he might not take the U.S. Treasury 
contributions, freeing him from the spending limits that come with 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would absolutely forgo the matching money,'' said Tony  
Fabrizio, a GOP pollster who worked for Bob Dole, the 1996 GOP 
nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern running against Steve Forbes in 1996 was we knew  
we would run out of money. You can't afford to run out of money 
against Steve Forbes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates who take matching money will be able to spend about  
$40 million, with individual caps in every state. The question is 
whether Bush could raise more than that if his spending was 
unregulated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's too early to make any of those tactical  
decisions,'' Bush said in an interview. ``First and foremost, I 
have to make up my mind about whether to run, then all the 
questions about matching funds ... will be answered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes will not take the matching money. The publisher of Forbes  
Inc. will not say how much of his own money he would spend. But he 
says he promised his daughters: ``I'll spend as little as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes to raise $20 million from traditional donors and  
already is assembling a campaign organization in states with early 
primaries: by early February, 40 staff members in Iowa, 15 in New 
Hampshire and 20 in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Bush, Forbes has honed his national message. Already  
established as an economic conservative, he has spent the two years 
since his failed 1996 campaign burnishing his image among social 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	His rhetoric is more solidly anti-abortion and he has forged  
relationships with key conservatives, such as Pat Robertson. He may 
never be the right wing's favorite, but those activists probably 
would not try to veto his candidacy this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' camp views Bush as the No. 1 target, privately  
suggesting the Texas governor would be a ``placeholder president'' 
-- an establishment guy in the image of his father, who never was 
trusted by the conservative base. 
</P>
<P>
	Look for Forbes to attack Bush's tax policies in Texas and try  
to saddle him with the unpopular actions of his father, such as 
raising taxes after promising not to in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I do make the decision to run, I bring the outsider  
perspective with business executive experience. I know what it 
takes to make real things work in the real world,'' Forbes said in 
an interview.

<HEADLINE> Doak Walker Honored at Cotton Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- From the No. 37 logo on the 37-yard lines to the  
highlight clips on the stadium monitor, Doak Walker was remembered 
fondly Friday at the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Played on what would've been his 72nd birthday in the stadium  
known as ``The House That Doak Built,'' the game betweeen Texas and 
Mississippi State was dedicated in memory of Walker, who died in 
September of complications from a skiing accident. The Longhorns 
won the game 38-11. 
</P>
<P>
	Longhorns running back Ricky Williams, who befriended Walker  
last year and has worn a No. 37 sticker on his helmet most of the 
season, made a fitting gesture -- albeit unintentional -- by running 
for a 37-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was definitely thinking about him,'' said Williams, a  
two-time winner of the college running back award named for Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking at his number every time I crossed the 37-yard  
line. I wanted to have a great game and give him a great birthday 
present. I'm happy I was able to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ties betweeen Walker, Williams and this game ran deep. Their  
close relationship made it even more special. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams won this year's Heisman Trophy, 50 years after Walker,  
and accepted the award standing in front of a painting of his 
mentor. Friday was the 50th anniversary of Walker's second MVP 
performance in the Cotton Bowl, and Williams, who ran for 203 yards 
and scored twice, earned the same honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush declared Friday as ``Doak Walker Day'' in  
Texas. Walker's four children served as grand marshals of a 
downtown parade Thursday and they were on the field during Friday's 
coin toss. Williams shook hands with one of Walker's sons and 
hugged one of his daughters prior to kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' teammates also were caught up in the Walker theme as  
the Longhorns practiced this week at his alma mater, Southern 
Methodist, and saw pictures and paintings of him in the locker room 
and meeting rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams switched jerseys from No. 34 to 37 when Texas played  
Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl stadium in October as a tribute to 
Walker. He let freshman Chris Robertson keep the number this time 
because he didn't want to detract from the first time he did it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was special for our team and for Ricky to play so  
well on Doak Walker Day, on his birthday, in `The House That Doak 
Built,' '' Texas coach Mack Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker became a national hero during his Mustangs days, both for  
his graceful play on the field and his humility off it. So many 
people wanted to watch him play that the Cotton Bowl was expanded 
during his college career. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker went on to star in the NFL, making All-Pro four times  
while helping the Detroit Lions win two NFL championships, and has 
been enshrined in the college and pro football halls of fame.

<HEADLINE> Midwest Braces for Big Snow Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Midwesterners headed to supermarkets and  
hardware stores Friday to snap up last-minute supplies as the 
region prepared for a storm that was expected to drop more than a 
foot of snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't advise travel at all ... especially with the strong  
winds,'' said Robin Smith, a meteorologist the National Weather 
Service in Joliet, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The developing system moving through the southern Plains had  
forecasters predicting that parts of Illinois, Indiana and Iowa 
could get up to 14 inches of snow by Saturday night. Gusty winds 
could create near-blizzard conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday evening, Des Moines, Iowa, had received 7 inches of  
snow and Mason City and Ottumwa each had 5 inches. Four inches had 
fallen in Sioux Falls, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	In Evansville, Ind., where the snow arrived first as the storm  
rolled up the Ohio River Valley, customers flocked to Buehler's 
Buy-Low to stock up on milk, bread, eggs and meat. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant manager Jeff Quirk said that, normally, the New Year's  
Day holiday is one of the store's slowest days of the year. But the 
throngs prompted him to bring in extra workers to help out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to call in everybody we could,'' Quirk said as he  
took a break from checkout lines where he had spent most of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines officials said passengers planning to fly from  
O'Hare this weekend should try to leave Friday or wait until Monday 
or Tuesday. More than 100 pieces of snow removal equipment in place 
at O'Hare and Midway airports, and hundreds of cots were on standby 
for travelers who may be stranded by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two people were killed in a weather-related accident  
Friday on Interstate 80 in Nebraska as freezing drizzle and up to 3 
inches of snow combined to make roads extremely slick. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Arkansas, about 47,000 customers were without power  
Friday evening following an ice storm.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players Sit On Final Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA players' union has decided to sit on its  
``final'' offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The bargaining process took a step backward Thursday when the  
union, prepared to offer an unprecedented concession by limiting 
the amount of money all players can earn, refused to present its 
new offer to the owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``They refused to meet with us, so we're not giving it to  
them,'' union attorney Jeffrey Kessler said. ``That's no way to 
negotiate. We'll sit on this until Jan. 7 if we have to. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to find out what's in it, they're going to have  
to meet. This is not a game. It's time to bargain in good faith, 
and the posturing has to stop,'' Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner David Stern and union director Billy Hunter spoke  
by telephone early in the day, and the league issued a news release 
saying the offer would be forwarded to the owners' labor relations 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But the momentum broke down in the afternoon when Kessler  
objected to the lack of a face-to-face bargaining session at which 
the offer could be presented. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to the union who spoke on condition of anonymity  
told The Associated Press that the proposal includes an absolute 
maximum salary for all players. The union previously agreed to 
limit the salaries of only those players with less than 10 years' 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners had been asking for an absolute maximum of $12.25  
million for players with 10 years' experience, while the union's 
offer was expected to come in somewhere around $15 million. The 
offer also will leave the sides about $500,000 apart on the maximum 
salary for players with less than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also was ready ask for lower minimum salaries for  
veterans and to move off its demand for 57 percent of revenues, 
dropping as low as 55 percent, sources said. The owners have 
offered between 53 and 54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have already made our final offer, so if theirs doesn't  
look a lot like ours then it's not going to be accepted,'' NBA 
chief legal officer Jeffrey Mishkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've told them that if they have a final offer then, please,  
give it to us. But there's not going to be a meeting until we see 
it and the committee evaluates it. For them to say we have to have 
a meeting, that's playing games,'' Mishkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Keith Van Horn of the New Jersey Nets became the  
third player to openly suggest that the union should let the 
players vote on the owners' latest proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	In joining his Nets' teammate Jayson Williams and Toronto's  
Kevin Willis in requesting the vote, Van Horn told The New York 
Times, ``Even though you have 19 guys (on the negotiating 
committee) representing the players, it may not necessarily be 
accurate or representative of how the other guys feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And if 65 or 70 percent of the players want to play and feel  
that the deal is satisfactory, you have to take that into 
consideration,'' Van Horn said. ``I think we're at a juncture now 
where we need to take all of the necessary action that we can to 
get this thing done. I think most players want to vote. I think a 
vote would be close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout moved into its seventh month today with only one  
week left before the league's Board of Governors meet. If no 
agreement is reached by then, Stern and deputy commissioner Russ 
Granik have said they will recommend canceling the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months have already been lost as the sides fight over how  
to divide almost $2 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	If an agreement is reached before Stern's deadline, a 45- to  
50-game schedule likely would begin in early February. 
</P>
<P>
	The league, union and arbitrator John Feerick participated in a  
conference call to discuss the case of three players -- Nick Van 
Exel, Marcus Camby and Reggie Slater -- who want to play the rest of 
the season in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The three players want unconditional clearance to play overseas,  
even if the lockout ends, and want their case resolved by Monday -- 
the deadline for Euro League teams to submit playoff-eligible 
rosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Feerick, however, told the union it could submit a brief on  
behalf of the players by Jan. 15, and the league can submit a 
rebuttal by Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	James Bryant, agent for the three players, did not return a  
phone call for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Feerick, dean of the Fordham Law School, ruled in a key NBA case  
during the summer, deciding that owners didn't have to pay players 
with guaranteed contracts during the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern and Hunter haven't met since last weekend when the league  
made its ``final'' offer in Denver and the union rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
	If the union's newest proposal is ever presented, Mishkin said  
it will be forwarded to the Labor Relations Committee and ``we will 
inform the union of the committee's response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have assured the union that if no further meetings between  
the negotiating committees are scheduled prior to Jan. 7, the 
union's final proposal will be put before the Board of Governors 
when it votes that day.''

<HEADLINE> Government Collects From Deadbeats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government reports a significant increase  
in collecting overdue child support payments from deadbeat parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The total number of delinquent payments that the government  
collected rose seven percent this year to a record $14.4 billion, 
an increase of 80 percent over the past six years. The number is a 
compilation of both federal and state efforts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal seizures of income tax refunds contributed greatly to  
the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of deadbeat parents across the nation opened their tax  
refund envelopes only to find that the money they were expecting 
was used to pay their delinquent child support, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Health and Human Services seized $1.1 billion  
in tax refunds from parents who were delinquent in their child 
support payments. More than a million American families in all 50 
states received money owed to them by delinquent parents through 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, state governments report the names of parents  
who owe child support payments to HHS, which then notifies the 
delinquent parents of the impending tax refund seizure. If the 
parents do not pay their debt, the amount is deducted from their 
refund. HHS can also report the failure to pay to credit agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also announced that next year's budget proposal  
will include funding to find and prosecute violators under new, 
strict laws that make moving across state lines to avoid paying 
child support a federal offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Coordinating collection and prosecution efforts between state  
and federal agencies has been very successful -- increasing the 
number of federal convictions 18-fold since the program's inception 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, currently in five states, would be expanded to 17  
more states. The White House budget proposal asks for $34 million 
from Congress to support legal staff in U.S. Attorneys' offices to 
deal specifically with deadbeat parents. Another $12 million will 
be reappropriated by HHS to hire and train investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	A state-by-state breakdown of the $14.4 billion in collections  
will be released later in the winter.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Tech's Hamilton One To Watch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Let those other quarterbacks go to the  
pros. College football seems to be in good shape for at least 
another year with guys like Joe Hamilton hanging around. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, overlooked in a year of Couch, Culpepper, McNabb and  
McNown, asserted himself as one to watch next season by leading No. 
12 Georgia Tech to a 35-28 victory over No. 17 Notre Dame in the 
Gator Bowl on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach George O'Leary said Hamilton's performance -- 13-for-20 for  
237 yards, three touchdown passes, one touchdown catch -- was 
nothing out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very positive individual and everything is always  
upbeat,'' O'Leary said. ``If there was a bomb in this room right 
now, he'd want to come in and defuse it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb in this case was a Notre Dame team that woke up in the  
second half, turning a 21-7 deficit into a 28-28 tie early in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton didn't change a thing, moving the team calmly down the  
field and looking for the big play only when Jacksonville native 
Dez White was too open to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton led touchdown drives of 87, 78, 84, 71 and 91 yards.  
</P>
<P>
	And more than the 44- and 55-yard bombs to White, O'Leary  
appreciated the little stuff. Like the quarterback sneaks that 
resulted in 5-yard gains, the perfect pitches on the option, the 
athleticism that allowed him to pitch the ball, then run a pass 
pattern for a 5-yard touchdown catch to open the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game has changed so much over the years, you need your  
quarterbacks to make plays for you when they're not there,'' 
O'Leary said. ``He made some plays today that weren't there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 5-foot-10, 189 pounds, Hamilton doesn't appear to have the  
frame for the NFL. It seems sure some NFL team will think about 
converting him to another position. 
</P>
<P>
	Luckily -- for himself and his team -- he has one more season to  
show how good a quarterback he can be. 
</P>
<P>
	More important than that, at least in his mind, he'll get a  
chance to take Georgia Tech a notch higher in the national picture. 
</P>
<P>
	That was what the victory over Notre Dame was all about to him.  
And that, more than anything else, is what will put him in the 
spotlight next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this win giving us 10 wins, we should finish in the top  
10 in the final poll, and that's where we want to be going into 
next year,'' he said. ``We don't have to climb any ladders. We'll 
control our own destiny. That's a big thing.''

<HEADLINE> Y2K Is Millennium Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With only a year to go until 2000, organizations  
that say their computers are ready to face the Millennium Bug now 
face the task of checking the fixes. 
</P>
<P>
	That means checking millions of lines of computer code, and then  
running what industry insiders call IVV -- independent verification 
and validation. And that's after companies and organizations have 
already spent a fortune to inoculate their computers. 
</P>
<P>
	But since the alternative is likely worse, a whole ``fix and  
test'' industry has sprouted up, manned by an army of programmers 
who independently check the original programmers' debugging and run 
computer simulations pretending it's Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	One such verifier is Sapiens International Corp., an Israeli  
company specializing in Year 2000 problems. Sapiens' verification 
business started picking up about six months ago and has really 
taken off in the last two or three months, said Monica Wooden, 
senior vice president for Sapiens America. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies like Sapiens have spent the past two years flushing  
out Y2K bugs for organizations ranging from Holiday Inn, IBM and 
Siemens Energy &AMP; Automation Inc., to the state of Arkansas and the 
Virginia Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1990, Sapiens is considered one of the leaders in the  
fix and test industry. It employs about 650 people and has $60 
million to $70 million in yearly sales. It has scanned more than 
100 million lines of code in more than 100,000 programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem known as the millennium bug, or the Year 2000 or  
just Y2K, results when computers use two digits to denote the year 
-- such as ``98'' for 1998 -- and read ``00'' as 1900 instead of 
2000. That causes computers to think they have moved back a century 
and give faulty readings, corrupt the data or shut down completely. 
</P>
<P>
	Worst-case scenarios for Jan. 1, 2000, speak of chaos in the  
financial markets, electricity shutdowns, disrupted airline 
schedules and missed paychecks. More moderate forecasts suggest 
spotty power outages, delayed flights and ATMs refusing to dispense 
cash for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	To see if it's ready for 2000, a company can send a sample of  
about 10,000 lines of computer code to the verification firm, which 
uses specialized software programs and a programmers to scan for 
erroneous date calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	They also run simulations, moving the computers' internal clocks  
forward to the last minutes of 1999 to see what happens. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a company's computer code is checked and converted, it  
should expect to spend another 25 percent more to have a third 
party verify that the corrected code works, said Shai Sole, 
Sapiens' chief technical officer. But even then, nothing is 
perfect. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will obviously be bugs,'' Wooden said. ``The key is to  
reduce the amount. There will be bugs at midnight (when 2000 
arrives) and there will be bugs afterward. You just have to keep 
chipping away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows how many U.S. companies have completed the first  
phase of their Y2K fix because there's no one source of hard data 
for that kind of information. 
</P>
<P>
	While Wooden wouldn't mention specific clients -- nondisclosure  
agreements are the norm in the Y2K industry -- she did say that the 
state governments of North Carolina, New York and Louisiana had 
begun asking for bids on testing. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said that American insurance companies are well  
prepared, and billing companies, payroll companies and other 
financial organizations are gearing up for the final round of 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Automatic Data Processing, the country's largest payroll  
company, handles about 30 million W-2 forms every year and says 
it's ready for 2000. Marketing director John Gregory said the 
company announced in April that its AutoPay system successfully 
passed an independent audit -- after working on the problem for 2 1/2 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an optimistic person by nature. I hope the world doesn't  
come to an end,'' Sole said with a laugh ``Obviously, there will be 
problems, ... but I don't think we're going to be exposed to 
physical threats.''

<HEADLINE> Court Lowers Breast Implant Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- The Nevada Supreme Court has trimmed  
$10 million from a $14.2 million award in a breast-implant case, 
saying there was no evidence Dow Chemical tried to conceal defects. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the court affirmed the jury's decision that the  
silicone implants made the woman sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte Mahlum of Las Vegas, who claimed her leaking implants  
caused a host of health problems, was awarded $10 million in 
punitive damages and $4.2 million in compensatory damages in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court ruled 4-1 on Thursday that she was not entitled to  
punitive damages, which require proof of fraudulent concealment. In 
a 3-2 vote, it kept intact the compensatory damages pertaining to 
pain and suffering, with two justices claiming Mahlum and her 
husband, Marvin, deserved nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I better wait until I speak with my attorney,'' Mahlum said  
when contacted at her home in Las Vegas. ``But I can say I started 
crying. I'm very happy for everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Geoffrey White, called the decision a major victory.  
</P>
<P>
	``This decision of the Nevada high court, which affirms the  
jury's verdict that silicone gel can cause disease in women, will 
resound across the nation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Chemical spokesman John Musser said the company was  
``extremely disappointed that the court has decided to allow a 
verdict to stand that was so heavily influenced by emotion rather 
than facts or medical evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a report issued last month, a scientific panel appointed by a  
federal judge to review conflicting scientific claims about 
implants found that no definite links existed between implants and 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahlum claims the implants, which she had removed, caused brain  
lesions, nerve damage, blotchy skin, aching, memory problems and 
seizures. Justice Bob Rose said the recent scientific findings did 
not matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mahlums' complaint was not tried in the court of  
scientific opinion, but before a jury of her peers who ... 
concluded that Dow Corning silicone gel breast implants caused her 
injuries,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Musser said he was glad the court eliminated the  
punitive damages saying there was ``no evidence anyone at Dow 
Chemical ever suspected, much less believed, breast implants were 
likely to injure anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of the implants, Dow Corning Inc., went into  
bankruptcy over the thousands of legal claims made against it 
regarding the implants. Dow Chemical owns 50 percent of Dow 
Corning, once the biggest maker of silicone gel breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
	It recently offered to pay $3.2 billion to an estimated 170,000  
women to settle the lawsuits.

<HEADLINE> 750,000 Watch Rose Bowl Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The 110th Tournament of Roses closed out  
the 20th century with the roar of a squadron of Navy fighter jets 
buzzing over the floral New Year's Day spectacle that looked back 
in tribute to astronauts, sports heroes, family life and ``Sesame 
Street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing! Ten times better in person,'' said ``7th  
Heaven'' TV actress Beverley Mitchell as she got a close view of 56 
``Echoes of the Century''-themed floats covered with flowers, 
leaves, grass, seeds and spices. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer buffs could catch the parade on the Internet thanks to  
float cams and a laptop-equipped parade staff who recounted details 
electronically from atop a float while an estimated half-billion 
people worldwide watched the spectacle on television and curbside. 
</P>
<P>
	In this parade, the U.S. Postal Service couldn't deliver.  
</P>
<P>
	When its trophy-winning ``Classic Movie Monsters'' float  
depicting Frankenstein and carrying real-life mistress of the night 
Elvira rounded a corner its motor conked out and the driver reached 
his hand out of the crypt where he was sitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need a tow!'' the driver shouted. A tow truck was hitched up  
within one minute and the float unceremoniously continued down the 
boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of New Year's celebrants staked out prime spots along  
a 5 1/2-mile route some 24 hours before Friday's parade start. An 
estimated 750,000 watched in person. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was another picture-perfect weather day in Southern  
California: Sunshine splashing the parade route, framed by the 
towering San Gabriel Mountains, was televised to an estimated 450 
million people in 102 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The grandstands were jammed, many of them Wisconsin fans in town  
for the Rose Bowl game between UCLA and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a festive crowd. Southern Californians moaned about  
41-degree chill at dawn, but it was balmy for Wisconsin visitors. 
It was 8 below zero in Green Bay, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to go back,'' said Brooke Torhorst, a recent  
graduate of the University of Wisconsin who stood along the parade 
route wearing shorts, a sweatshirt and sandals. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 95 arrests, mostly minor violations such as public  
drunkenness, fighting and vehicle code violations, police 
spokeswoman Janet Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
	The parade combined high tech with whimsy as well as memorable  
symbols of the 20th century. There also were 22 marching bands, 25 
equestrian units and celebrity grand marshals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my third time. I'm going to try to get it right this  
time,'' Shirley Temple Black, the former child star and U.S. 
ambassador, said jokingly. She shared grand marshal honors with 
astronaut Buzz Aldrin, film producer David Wolper and the late 
baseball legend Jackie Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a sobering entry from the Simon Wiesenthal Center's  
Museum of Tolerance. ``Jerusalem, City of Peace'' honored the holy 
city's three religious traditions of Judaism, Islam and 
Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest crowd pleasers included Humor Trophy winner  
``Friends for Life,'' depicting ``Sesame Street'' characters Big 
Bird, the Cookie Monster and Bert &AMP; Ernie, and Sweepstakes Trophy 
winner ``Friends of the Rain Forest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The President's Trophy was awarded to ``Mother's Day,'' the  
Florists' Transworld Delivery entry featuring famous TV moms 
Shirley Jones (``Partridge Family''), Marion Ross (``Happy Days'') 
and Cynthia Harris (``Mad About You''). It included raccoons made 
of cornsilk, uva grass bunnies and yellow chrysanthemum ducks 
perched around a gigantic fallen log. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothy Letterman, mother of TV talk show host David Letterman,  
was aboard Kiwanis International's ``Children of the World'' float, 
which won the Isabella Coleman Trophy for presentation of color and 
color harmony through use of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Website,'' the 10-ton City of Los Angeles entry featuring a  
large spider building a web with computers, was the parade's first 
high-tech float, boasting riders chatting on laptops with a live 
Internet audience.

<HEADLINE> Repairman Arrested for Explosives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A utility repairman was in custody Friday  
after authorities discovered bomb materials, including 250 pounds 
of ammonium nitrate, the same ingredient used in the Oklahoma City 
bombing, at his workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Joseph Madronich Jr., 44, enjoyed making small explosives  
and fireworks and did not appear to have a political agenda, 
according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe he was using the material for small explosives  
such as cherry bombs and M-80s that he sold to co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. employee was being held  
Friday on $1 million bail on three counts of possessing an 
explosive device. 
</P>
<P>
	The materials were discovered Thursday in a locker at a PG&AMP;E  
warehouse. Police and fire officials evacuated 75 people from the 
building and a facility across the street, concerned that the 
ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer, had been mixed with volatile 
substances and might explode. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside another locker police found a 33-gallon drum of calcium  
nitrate along with books on bomb making, broken flares, electronic 
devices and a ``small quantity of actual, ready-to-go explosives,'' 
police spokesman Sherman Ackerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, (Madronich) was set up to make bombs,'' Ackerson  
said. ``If activated as an explosive, it would have destroyed a 
good portion of the building it was found in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After he was booked, Madronich led officers to ``a whole bunch  
more bomb-making stuff,'' at a second PG&AMP;E facility, Ackerson said. 
Authorities also carted off boxes of material from Madronich's 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant District Attorney Jean Daly said Madronich appeared to  
be motivated by profit rather than politics, selling his small 
explosives to co-workers who nicknamed him ``the Unabomber.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He appears to be a loner,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Madronich, who lived with his parents, was described by  
neighbors as a polite, well-behaved man. He has no known criminal 
record, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Madronich could face additional charges in federal court if it  
is determined the ammonium nitrate was to be used for an illegal 
purpose -- such as explosives. The charges Madronich faces are not 
linked to the ammonium nitrate, which is not against the law to 
possess. 
</P>
<P>
	Ammonium nitrate was the principal ingredient in the bomb that  
destroyed the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995, killing 168 
people.

<HEADLINE> NBA Union Still Holding Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the NBA lockout, the new year began like the  
old one ended. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight day, the players' union refused to turn  
over its ``final'' offer Friday unless owners agreed to a 
negotiating session. 
</P>
<P>
	Union attorney Jeffrey Kessler called it a stall tactic.  
</P>
<P>
	``They are trying to delay the process of meeting so they can  
keep trying to put pressure on the players,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so, said Jeffrey Mishkin, the NBA's chief legal counsel.  
</P>
<P>
	``The reason for not having a meeting is that we have given our  
final offer and they have rejected it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that as soon as the union's proposal was in hand, it  
would be presented to the negotiating committee and then to the 
Board of Governors for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process will start on their timing, and when they're ready  
we'll give them our proposal,'' Kessler said. ``We are doing what 
we think will most further the process to increase the chances of 
getting a deal done, not to decrease the chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union originally planned to give its proposal to the owners  
on Thursday, but it never happened because Mishkin and Kessler 
couldn't agree on how it should be presented. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides have until Thursday to reach an agreement - the day  
the Board of Governors will meet to the decide whether to cancel 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's new proposal will include a limit on the salary any  
player can receive -- a concession the league has pushed for 
throughout nine months of negotiations. It also includes a demand 
for 55 percent of revenues in the fourth year of the agreement; the 
league has offered 53 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to comment on a proposal that has not been  
made,'' Mishkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent David Falk disputed a published report saying he would now  
prefer to scrap the entire season. Union president Patrick Ewing 
and several prominent members of the union's negotiating committee 
are clients of Falk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly don't want to scrub the season, but if it's a  
choice of taking the deal totally on the owners' terms or shutting 
it down, at that point I think the position to take is to shut it 
down and start fresh. But I don't think that's going to happen,'' 
Falk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Players on the union's negotiating committee expected to travel  
to New York early in the week to begin a final round of 
negotiations. It now appears that may be delayed until mid-week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way a deal can be made is to get the people in the  
room, and they'll conclude that,'' Kessler said. ``I don't think 
the owners want to lose the season any more than the players do. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't about pride and it isn't about relationships. This  
is about the process, and when you're trying to engage in a final

	Khmer Rouge Trial Called For  
</P>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has  
made a stunning reversal, today announcing that the architects of 
the genocidal Khmer Rouge policies implemented two decades ago must 
stand trial for crimes against humanity. In a statement broadcast 
over national television, Hun Sen said local and international 
preparations for a tribunal would proceed. Separately, an aide to 
the high level Khmer Rouge defectors warned that any trial would 
expose the roles of the United States and China in the guerrillas' 
brutal rise to power.

	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II stopped on the threshold  
of the new century to look back on the old one, speaking on New 
Year's Day 1999 of the death camps and world wars of the 20th 
century. Hope for the next 100 years was found in the lessons of 
the ones gone by, he said: The respect for fellow man enshrined in 
the universal declaration of human rights that followed the 
deadliest of the wars. The pope spoke to thousands filling the 
basilica of St. Peter's for his first Mass of the new year.

	CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- The Nevada Supreme Court has trimmed  
$10 million from a $14.2 million award in a breast-implant case, 
saying there was no evidence Dow Chemical tried to conceal defects. 
However, the court yesterday affirmed the jury's decision that the 
silicone implants made the woman sick. Charlotte Mahlum of Las 
Vegas, who claimed her leaking implants caused a host of health 
problems, was awarded $10 million in punitive damages and $4.2 
million in compensatory damages in 1995.

activist said today. The Palestinians oppose the project in the Ras 
al-Amud neighborhood, saying it undercuts their efforts to 
establish a future capital in Jerusalem's eastern sector. Previous

<HEADLINE> Soldini Wins Leg of Yacht Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Italian Giovanni Soldini won the  
second leg of the Around Alone around-the-world yacht race after 
British rival and race leader Mike Golding encountered trouble 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Golding led by two days, 17 hours over Soldini following the  
first leg from Charleston, S.C., to Cape Town, South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of boat builders flew to assist Golding in the remote Tom  
Bowling Bay in the far north of New Zealand after he damaged his 
yacht Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Golding's yacht, Team Group 4, was towed to safety by a fishing  
boat Friday after he hit a submerged object and began taking on 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Preston, from Golding's headquarters in London said  
Golding was trying to make repairs to stay in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini, aboard Fila, arrived in Auckland at 5 a.m. local time  
and was met by a flotilla of welcome boats, including one carrying 
Auckland mayor Christine Fletcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The chasers were absorbed in their own battle, with yachtswoman  
Isabelle Autissier overtaking fellow French sailor Marc Thiercelin. 
</P>
<P>
	Class two leader J.P. Mouligne, sailing a smaller boat, had  
closed within 20 miles of the pair.

<HEADLINE> Packers, 49ers Go Wild-Card Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- LeRoy Butler doesn't buy the notion that  
the Green Bay Packers have slipped in the NFL hierarchy, and for 
that matter, he says the same can be said about the San Francisco 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	Either the Packers, the 49ers or both have been involved in six  
of the past seven NFC title games and three of the past four Super 
Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike past years, when they charged into the playoffs as  
division champions, Green Bay (11-5) meets San Francisco (12-4) 
Sunday in a wild-card game after being overtaken by Minnesota 
(15-1) and Atlanta (14-2) as the conference's top seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been in championship games all the time,'' said Butler,  
the Packers' safety and a 49ers' nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever wins this game is going to sneak up on Minnesota or  
Atlanta and probably beat them because they're thinking just what 
some others are thinking, that these teams have slipped. But no 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings displaced the Packers as NFC Central champions and  
the Falcons beat out the 49ers in the NFC West, but Butler is not 
ready to concede the balance of power has dramatically changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other teams, they haven't accomplished anything for  
anybody to get so rah-rah about them going to the Super Bowl,'' 
Butler said. ``These two teams are the ones who have been there and 
done that and know what it takes to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	49ers quarterback Steve Young said the path to the Super Bowl  
may be different this time but it can be done, as recent history 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get to the Super Bowl, you have to face certain teams along  
the way,'' Young said. ``For both teams, this is a little unusual 
for us to be in this spot. But we can just take the lead from last 
year's Denver Broncos and come from this spot to win the Super 
Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers and 49ers are playing each other in the postseason  
for the fourth straight year, though this is the first time as wild 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams overcame troubles during the season to reach the  
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay was hit by a wave of injuries, particularly on  
offense. Antonio Freeman, Dorsey Levens, Robert Brooks, Mark 
Chmura, Vonnie Holliday and Craig Newsome were among the injured 
Packers who missed time, though they are expected to be ready for 
Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Favre, a three-time MVP, had a subpar season, throwing 23  
interceptions, his highest total since 1993, when he had 24. But he 
still finished with a league-high 4,212 yards passing and 31 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if we're a scary team, but I don't think anyone's  
going to take us lightly,'' Favre said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco weathered the loss of its best defensive player,  
tackle Bryant Young, who broke his right leg Nov. 30, as well as 
the distractions of a front-office exodus that saw Carmen Policy 
resign as team president and Dwight Clark quit as general manager 
to join Policy in assembling the new Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	A power vacuum continues to exist in the 49ers front office  
because of the nebulous state of ownership, with Eddie DeBartolo 
awaiting NFL clearance to resume control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	And both clubs have had to confront rumors about the future of  
their coaches, including speculation that Green Bay's Mike 
Holmgren, a former San Francisco offensive coordinator, and the 
49ers' Steve Mariucci, whose NFL apprenticeship included four years 
as Packers' quarterback coach, could ultimately trade places. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren and Mariucci have tried to keep a lid on the rumors by  
saying little about them this week, but they remain a prominent 
backdrop to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco will be trying to reverse a history of failure  
against the Packers. The 49ers have lost their last five games 
against Green Bay, including season-ending defeats in the playoffs 
the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay is the winningest playoff team in NFL history, going  
22-9 and could become the first NFC representative to advance to 
the Super Bowl in three consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers beat the 49ers 36-22 earlier this season and retain  
the psychological edge with their run of success against San 
Francisco. They have a history of producing big plays when they 
need them against the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a healthy Levens, we got Brett Favre, Freeman. We're  
going to get Brooks back and Chmura,'' general manager Ron Wolf 
said. ``Now, go ahead and play us.''

<HEADLINE> Midwest Braces for Big Snow Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Midwesterners headed to supermarkets and  
hardware stores to snap up last-minute supplies as the region 
prepared for a storm that was expected to drop more than a foot of 
snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't advise travel at all ... especially with the strong  
winds,'' said Robin Smith, a meteorologist the National Weather 
Service in Joliet, Ill. AM-Winter Weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said the northern parts of Illinois and Indiana  
could get up to 14 inches of snow by Saturday night. Gusty winds 
could create near-blizzard conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	In Evansville, Ind., where the snow arrived first as the storm  
rolled up the Ohio River Valley, customers flocked to Buehler's 
Buy-Low to stock up on milk, bread, eggs and meat. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant manager Jeff Quirk said that, normally, the New Year's  
Day holiday is one of the store's slowest days of the year. But the 
throngs prompted him to bring in extra workers to help out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to call in everybody we could,'' Quirk said as he  
took a break from checkout lines where he had spent most of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines officials said passengers planning to fly from  
O'Harethis weekend should try to leave Friday or wait until Monday 
or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several inches of snow had already fallen in the Plains by  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Missouri, the new year brought a combination of snow, sleet,  
ice and freezing that made things a mess for holiday travelers.

<HEADLINE> Language Learning Starts in Crib </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Babies may not know a verb from a noun, but  
researchers have found that even seven-month-olds can learn how 
sentences are organized, a discovery that may lead to early 
diagnosis of infants with language disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our study tells us that infants are constantly looking around  
the world trying to find ... all kinds of patterns that describe 
that world,'' said Gary Marcus, a New York University psychologist. 
``It shows that they are very active learners even at seven months 
of age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marcus is lead author of a study appearing Friday in the journal  
Science. 
</P>
<P>
	In their study, the researchers created a series of three-word  
sentences with specific word structures and then tested the infants 
to see if they could recognize changes in the sentence structure. 
</P>
<P>
	The words, said Marcus, were actually an artificial language  
that conveyed no meaning. The study was to determine if the babies 
could recognize a pattern in the way the words were arranged. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, one sentence structure would be ``Li ti li'' or  
``Wo fe wo.'' This is known as an ABA pattern. Another sentence 
structure could be ``Wo fe fe'' or ``Li ti ti'' and this would be 
an ABB pattern. 
</P>
<P>
	To test the infants, the researchers played a recording of one  
structure for two minutes to train the babies in that pattern. Then 
the babies for two minutes heard a series that mixed one pattern 
with another. 
</P>
<P>
	The babies, for instance, would first hear the ABA pattern for  
two minutes, and then two minutes of a mixture of the ABA and the 
ABB patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	The recordings were played on speakers that were equipped with  
lights that blinked on whenever the sentences were played. The 
results were based on how 45 babies in the study reacted to the 
lights. Sentence structures that were new tended to capture 
attention longer than structures that had already been heard, said 
Marcus. This method has been widely used to study the thinking 
processes of infants. 
</P>
<P>
	``They looked longer when the sounds came from a new grammar (or  
sentence structure) compared to when the old grammar was played,'' 
said Marcus. ``There was a difference of about nine seconds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Pinker, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology cognitive  
researcher, said the study suggests that recognizing symbolic 
patterns or rules of structure ``may be a basic mechanism of the 
human brain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marcus and his co-authors, Pinker wrote in Science, ``have now  
shown that infants as young as seven months can abstract simple 
rules from language-like sounds, suggesting that rule formation is 
not a late add-on, but is there from the start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier studies by a number of researchers, said Marcus, have  
shown that babies are able to recognize the difference between a 
two-syllable word and one with three syllables. 
</P>
<P>
	The new research, he said, shows that the tots can also  
recognize sentence structures, an essential tool for learning to 
use language. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcus said his group now wants to determine if babies who do  
poorly on this test later demonstrate problems in talking or in 
understanding speech. He said it is still not known how difficulty 
in recognizing spoken sentence structure will actually impact a 
child's later use of language, but he suspected it may be a factor 
for children who are late in learning to talk. 
</P>
<P>
	How well babies can recognize visual symbolic patterns --  
essential for learning to read -- is not known, said Marcus, but he 
noted: ``I suspect that infants can do the same type of things with 
visual stimuli.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marcus said the research does send a message for parents.  
</P>
<P>
	``It tells parents just how powerful a learner an infant really  
is.''

<HEADLINE> $2.5 M Awarded in Prison Shoot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Insisting a guard's fatal shooting of a San  
Quentin inmate was justified, the state has nevertheless agreed to 
a $2.5 million settlement with the prisoner's family. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's announcement came a month after a U.S. District Court  
jury condemned California's policy on the use of guns by prison 
guards in awarding $2.3 million to the mother and widow of inmate 
Mark Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the settlement, the Corrections Department said  
lawyers for Adams' estate would have sought over $1 million in 
attorneys' fees. The department said it agreed to the settlement to 
save the taxpayers the costs of an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams, 30, a convicted murderer, was fatally shot in March 1994  
while fighting with another prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
	The guard, Timothy S. Reynolds, a trained marksman, said he saw  
the other inmate apparently helpless, shouted for Adams to get 
down, fired two warning shots and then aimed at Adams' leg from 25 
yards away. Adams moved suddenly and was struck in the back of the 
head, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors questioned Reynolds' credibility and concluded non-lethal  
methods should have been used, such as batons, which were available 
nearby, the jury foreman told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the settlement, Corrections Department lawyer Pam  
Smith-Steward said the defendants ``were unfairly blamed for the 
violence that inevitably erupts in a prison setting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Adams' estate could not be reached for comment. No  
one answered at the lawyers' offices late Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Is U.S. Murder Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago is the nation's 1998 murder capital,  
despite experiencing a 10-year low in murders, according to 
preliminary data from cities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago had 698 homicides in 1998, surpassing New York City's  
homicide totals for the first time ever. New York has seen a 
dramatic drop in its homicides. There were 629 there last year, 
compared with a 1990 high of 2,262. 
</P>
<P>
	When looked at per capita, Chicago's 1998 homicide rate is more  
than double that of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad news comes at a time when Chicago is witnessing a drop  
in murders. There were 759 murders there in 1997. The last year 
murders numbered less than 700 was 1988, when there were 663. 
</P>
<P>
	``One murder is too many, but we are always pleased when the  
numbers go down,'' Chicago police spokesman Pat Camden said. 
</P>
<P>
	He credited the city's community policing program for much of  
the decline. But once the final numbers are in, Chicago is expected 
to again have the highest violent crime rate of the eight largest 
U.S. cities, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the city's violent crime rate has dropped consistently  
in last decade (it dropped 20 percent overall between 1990 and 
1997), it still lags behind the other largest cities. In that same 
period, New York City cut its violent crime rate 47 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is upsetting and very disturbing that we have now passed  
New York City in the number of murders...,'' said Arthur Lurigio, 
chairman of the criminal justice department at Loyola University. 
``I am at a loss as to why Chicago's reductions are not 
commensurate to other large cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Poverty levels in Chicago could account for some of the  
statistics, said James Alan Fox, dean of the College of Criminal 
Justice at Northeastern University in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Chicago police officials hope their efforts will  
eventually pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are making a long-term investment in our communities,  
making them places where neighbors feel safe and criminals feel 
unwelcome,'' Chicago Police Supt. Terry Hillard said. ``This 
process may take a little longer, but the long-term rewards are 
great -- steadily declining crime rates and increased quality of 
life.''

<HEADLINE> Williams Strikes the Heisman Pose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- With everything Texas running back Ricky Williams  
accomplished this award-winning season and through his 
record-shattering career, there was one thing he hadn't done -- 
strike the Heisman Trophy pose. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams celebrated his 37-yard touchdown run in the third  
quarter of the Longhorns' 38-11 victory over Mississippi State in 
the Cotton Bowl by mimicking the trophy he took home last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something the guys have been trying to get me to do all  
year. I didn't want to do it until I won the trophy,'' said 
Williams, who gave a Heisman-caliber performance with 30 carries 
for 203 yards and two touchdowns and five receptions for 45 yards. 
He was named the game's offensive most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
	As the leading scorer in Division I-A history, Williams has had  
plenty of chances to show off in the end zone. Instead, he usually 
handed the ball to officials and quietly returned to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Not this time.  
</P>
<P>
	In his first trip to the end zone since winning the Heisman,  
Williams tucked the ball under his left arm, curled his right leg 
and stiff-armed an imaginary defender with his right arm. He didn't 
hold it long, but he didn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time Williams struck the pose in public since  
doing it at a baseball card photo shoot the summer before his 
freshman year. Embarrassed that it ended up on the card, Williams 
tried buying as many as he could and vowed to never do it again. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing was right Friday. It came after a long run -- what  
would be his longest of the day -- and it put Texas up 21-3 with 
12:34 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a big enough lead that a penalty (for celebrating)  
wouldn't hurt us,'' said Williams. The move cost Texas 15 yards and 
Williams returned to his low-key routine when he scored again about 
10 minutes later to put the Longhorns (9-3) up 31-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi State (8-5) held Williams to 75 yards on 15 carries  
in the first half, but two long touchdown passes from Major 
Applewhite to Wane McGarity gave Texas a 14-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	From Williams' first carry of the third quarter -- a 5-yard burst  
up the middle -- it was evident that he had fresher legs than his 
pursuers. 
</P>
<P>
	On his next carry, Williams went around the left side of the  
line and darted virtually untouched for the 37-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had (blitzed) all the gaps and we didn't stay in the  
outside gap,'' Bulldogs coach Jackie Sherrill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Barrin Simpson said the way Texas' offensive line  
handled the blitz in the second half helped spring Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first half, I feel we did a pretty good job defensing  
the run,'' said Simpson, who led MSU with 10 tackles. ``In the 
second half, we just didn't execute on blitzes and with a great 
back like Ricky, you can't make many mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams left the game with 4:30 left following a 13-yard run.  
He got a big ovation from the pro-Texas crowd of 72,611, many of 
whom chanted his name.

	Williams became the seventh Heisman winner to play in the Cotton  
Bowl the season he won the award, but just the third to be on the 
winning side. He joined the late Doak Walker as the only players to 
win the Heisman and be named Cotton Bowl MVP the same season. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams befriended Walker before the former Southern Methodist  
star died in September and has worn a No. 37 sticker on his helmet 
since then as a tribute. Williams wore No. 37 the last time he 
played in the stadium known as ``The House That Doak Built,'' but 
didn't this time because he didn't want to cheapen the original 
gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	Fittingly, Williams' long touchdown was 37 yards -- something he  
pointed out to reporters. Both 37-yard lines had large red circles 
with 37 painted in white in memory of Walker, who would've turned 
72 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I wanted to have a great game and give him a great  
birthday present,'' Williams said. ``I'm happy I was able to do 
that.''

<HEADLINE> New Orleans Firework Deaths Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Investigators were trying to determine Friday  
what caused a truck loaded with fireworks to explode during 
preparations for a New Year's Eve show, killing two technicians and 
critically injuring an off-duty deputy. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast, which happened about 8:30 p.m. Thursday, blew the top  
and sides off the white cargo truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees from Classic Fireworks by Events Inc., a New  
Orleans-area company, had been loading fireworks on a barge at a 
wharf on the Harvey Canal. The barge was to be towed up the canal 
to the nearby Mississippi River, where it was scheduled to be the 
launching point for the midnight fireworks show held every New 
Year's Eve on the New Orleans waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say a decision had been made to scale back the show,  
so workers were taking some of the fireworks off the barge and 
putting them back on the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	One man was in the truck and another was just outside it when  
the explosion took place, said Austin Banks, a spokesman for the 
Department of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The dead were 
identified as Jason Stamps, 24, of Slidell, and Scott Benoit, 29, 
of Harahan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scott and Jason were trained pyrotechnicians. They worked with  
Classic Fireworks for some time,'' Banks said. But, he added, any 
work involving fireworks is risky. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, ATF agents were examining the truck's skeleton,  
looking for clues to what caused the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Benoit's brother, Eddie Benoit, 41, of Harahan was in critical  
condition Friday with burns over 50 percent of his body. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Benoit was a sergeant with the traffic division of the  
Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. He was off duty and it was 
unclear whether he was employed in any capacity by Classic 
Fireworks or simply helping his brother. The company's president 
did not return telephone calls Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	After the blast, tugboat workers ran to the scene and found  
Eddie Benoit running around the dock area aflame. 
</P>
<P>
	The fireworks show was canceled.

<HEADLINE> Look at Potential GOP Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A brief look at potential Republican presidential candidates in  
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Dan Quayle, 51, George Bush's vice president. He decided  
against a run in 1996. He has a wide fund-raising base and is well 
established in the early primary states. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Elizabeth Dole, 62, the president of the American Red Cross  
and former Cabinet member for Presidents Reagan and Bush. She is 
the wife of unsuccessful 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole. Mrs. Dole is 
considering a presidential bid, but is more likely to find her way 
onto the nominee's short list for vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Gary Bauer, 52, former Reagan administration official and  
current president of the conservative Family Research Council. 
Bauer pushed his anti-abortion, low taxes, school prayer, family 
values agenda in 1998 congressional races, while raising about $7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- George W. Bush, 52, governor of Texas and son of the former  
president. He is considered the early favorite for the party's 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	-- John Ashcroft, 56, former two-term governor of Missouri and  
current senator. He is the gospel-singing son and grandson of 
evangelical preachers, and the overwhelming favorite in a 
presidential straw poll of Christian Coalition leaders in February. 
</P>
<P>
	-- John McCain, 62, a Vietnam War hero, POW, and current senator  
from Arizona. He is known to colleagues as a strong voice on 
military issues and a staunch supporter of campaign finance and 
tobacco legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Lamar Alexander, 58, former two-term governor of Tennessee and  
secretary of education under President Bush. He ran unsuccessfully 
for the nomination in 1996. He may be the best organized in Iowa 
and New Hampshire, but has not shown an ability yet to energize a 
large following. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Pat Buchanan, 60, former Nixon and Reagan adviser, scribe and  
longtime co-host of CNN's ``Crossfire.'' He gave Dole a scare in 
the 1996 primaries. He has begun to seriously consider another bid. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Steve Forbes, 51, president and CEO of Forbes Inc. He rode his  
flat tax idea to a surprising third place finish in 1996's 
Republican primary season. He has proven a willingness to spend his 
own money and an ability to raise large sums of traditional 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tommy Thompson, 58, who just won a fourth term as Wisconsin's  
governor. He was considered by Dole as a potential running mate in 
1996. He thinks he could get in the race late, raising as much as 
$10 million in the last six months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Fred Thompson, 56, a well-known character actor in many  
action-oriented movies who was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1994 
from Tennessee. He raised his already-high profile by chairing the 
1997 Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearings into alleged 
campaign fund raising wrongdoing by the Democratic Party in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Newt Gingrich, 55, the retiring House speaker from Georgia. He  
achieved his long-held dream of becoming speaker after guiding the 
Republican Party to its first House majority in 40 years in 1994. 
He was felled by the party's poor showing in 1998 but should not be 
ruled out on the national scene because of his popularity among 
rank-and-file Republicans and his fund-raising abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	-- John Kasich, 46, chairman of the House Budget Committee. The  
Ohio lawmaker raised his already high profile during the 105th 
Congress by fighting for budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	-- George Pataki, 53, who in November won a second term as  
governor of New York. He is traveling outside his home state to 
raise his national profile. Whether or not he runs, Pataki would be 
a vice presidential prospect. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Bob Smith, 57, former House member and current senator from  
New Hampshire. A long shot, Smith has not fared well in polls, even 
in his own state. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Pete Wilson, 65, outgoing governor of California. He announced  
he was running for president in August 1995, but dropped out 
shortly thereafter amid his low standing in public opinion polls 
and his difficulty in raising campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rudy Giuliani, 54, New York City mayor. A leading voice of the  
party's moderate wing, he recently visited Iowa to test the waters. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jack Kemp, 63, the party's 1996 vice presidential nominee. He  
ran unsuccessfully on his own in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Panthers Interested in Seifert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- The Carolina Panthers have focused their search  
for a new coach on former San Francisco coach George Seifert, The 
Charlotte Observer is reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert flew to Charlotte Monday night and met with Panthers  
owner Jerry Richardson before flying back home to San Francisco 
late Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Seifert nor Richardson could be reached for comment, the  
newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear late Thursday whether the Panthers made Seifert  
an offer, but the newspaper reported that the Panthers are making a 
strong move on Seifert and might not wait on Green Bay coach Mike 
Holmgren, who can't be contacted by other teams until the Packers' 
season ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay plays at San Francisco in a wild-card playoff game  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one other team interested in Seifert, the Baltimore  
Ravens, dropped him from its list of prospective candidates 
Thursday, apparently because he's working on a deal with the 
Panthers. The Seattle Seahawks also are interested in Seifert, but 
haven't been nearly as aggressive as Carolina in pursuing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert has been out of coaching the past two years. He won two  
Super Bowl championships and compiled the best winning percentage 
in NFL history -- .755 with a record of 108-35 -- during seven 
seasons in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert wants control over player personnel decisions, but isn't  
insisting on the title of coach/general manager, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren wants that dual role, and is widely regarded as the  
league's hottest coaching candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers already are working on assembling a staff of  
assistant coaches. Tony Wise, most recently the assistant head 
coach of the Chicago Bears, is the top choice to be the offensive 
line coach and is scheduled to come to Charlotte early next week 
for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Three offensive assistants from former coach Dom Capers' staff --  
coordinator Gil Haskell, tight ends coach Don Breaux and wide 
receivers coach Richard Williamson -- have been retained.

<HEADLINE> One Killed in Massive Mich. Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAYLING, Mich. (AP) -- In the blank whiteness of the snow, some  
of those trapped in the deadly, ``never ending'' highway pileup 
bailed out of their cars and ran. Morgan Cadene didn't dare move. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could hear people screaming, `Don't get out of your car!  
You'll get hit! Don't get out of your cars,''' said Cadene of 
Thunder Bay, Ontario, whose Ford Explorer was wrecked. ``It just 
kept going -- the crumpling of metal, time after time. It was 
sickening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers heading north on Interstate 75 ran into blinding snow at  
about noon Thursday, setting off a 100-car collision stretching 
over a mile that left one dead and 41 more injured. The pileup 
happened about 180 miles northwest of Detroit, in a remote part of 
northern Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Some cars and pickups were on top of other vehicles, while other  
cars had skidded into the ditch beside the tree-lined road. Some 
150 people were stranded, and had to be bused to area shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Elaine Lockitski of White Lake Township was traveling with her  
husband to meet relatives and go snowmobiling. She said the 
whiteout came on suddenly and didn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could see in the distance it was getting really fuzzy. I  
told my husband to slow down. Then all of a sudden, all we saw was 
red lights,'' she said. ``All of a sudden my husband said, `Oh my 
God, hold on!''' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple didn't hit anyone, and Ms. Lockitski remembers the  
silence after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then in the distance you could hear ``bam, bam, bam.' It  
was never ending,'' she said. ``And then we started hearing all the 
sirens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State police closed an 11-mile section of I-75 until about 8  
p.m. Police said people were likely driving fast in the mixed 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like somebody pulled a curtain down, you went from  
clear conditions to whiteout conditions just that quick,'' county 
emergency management spokesman Dennis Long said.

<HEADLINE> Nick Nolte Takes on Fiercest Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Nick Nolte is known for portraying the angry.  
</P>
<P>
	But his role as the fiery Col. Gordon Tall in ``The Thin Red  
Line'' may be his fiercest yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ferocity? That's fairly easy for me to access,'' said the  
57-year-old. ``I've been delving into rage for quite some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``The Thin Red Line'' the film adaptation of James Jones'  
World War II novel, Nolte's character is determined to overtake a 
hill on Guadalcanal and it threatens to break apart his troops. 
</P>
<P>
	In one scene, howitzers are pounding the earth behind Nolte as  
he yells at his captain over a field phone. Director Terrence 
Malick told Nolte he had to be more powerful on the phone than the 
howitzers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course I chose not to wear earplugs, so I couldn't hear for  
several weeks afterward,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Families Mourn 6 Yacht Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOBART, Australia (AP) -- Mourners dropped a red rose and a bed  
of daisies into a river today in remembrance of each of the six 
sailors killed in Australia's disastrous Sydney-to-Hobart yacht 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	As the rosettes bobbed in the Derwent River, the glorious summer  
weather could scarcely have contrasted more sharply with the 
howling winds and mountainous seas that ravaged the race fleet five 
days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 115 yachts in this year's race, 70 withdrew because of the  
hurricane-strength winds. Rescuers saved about 50 sailors from 
seven damaged or sunken craft. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 people attended the ceremony on Constitution Dock in  
Hobart, on the island of Tasmania. Many of the yachts that survived 
the race were tied up at the dock. 
</P>
<P>
	The memorial service began with a fly-over of airplanes in a  
``missing man'' formation. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsignor Phillip Green, speaking from a table draped by a green  
and gold sail, noted that for more than 50 years, Constitution Dock 
was a haven at the end of a race -- a place where rivalries were 
forgotten and friendships forged. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Guy, who died on his yacht, the Business Post Naiad, gave  
100 percent to life, said his daughter, Karen Guy. Phil Skeggs was 
also lost on Naiad. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Kulmar of the Sword of Orion spoke of the dedication to  
sailing of his dead friend, British yachtsman Glyn Charles. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a bloody good bloke,'' Kulmar said.  
</P>
<P>
	Richard Winning of the yacht Winston Churchill said he would  
always remember Jim Lawler, John Dean and Mike Bannister. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sea was so vast and the ship was so small,'' Winning said.  
``Man and everything made by man is finite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he hoped the dead men's families took some comfort from  
knowing that they died doing something they loved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will learn from the tragic circumstances of your deaths,''  
said Hugo van Kretschmar, the head of the Cruising Yacht Club of 
Australia, which organized the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will miss you always,'' he said. ``We will remember you  
always.''

	Today is Saturday, Jan. 2, the second day of 1999. There are 363  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 2, 1900, Secretary of State John Hay announced the  
``Open Door Policy'' to facilitate trade with China. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1492, the leader of the last Arab stronghold in Spain  
surrendered to Spanish forces loyal to King Ferdinand II and Queen 
Isabella I.

Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1929, the United States and Canada reached agreement on joint  
action to preserve Niagara Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1935, Bruno Hauptmann went on trial in Flemington, N.J., on  
charges of kidnapping and murdering the infant son of Charles and 
Anne Lindbergh. (Hauptmann was found guilty and executed.) 
</P>
<P>
	In 1942, the Philippine capital of Manila was captured by  
Japanese forces during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1960, Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts announced his  
candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1965, the New York Jets signed University of Alabama  
quarterback Joe Namath for a reported $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, President Nixon signed legislation requiring states to

<HEADLINE> History Favors Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The only thing separating Buffalo and Miami is  
1,400 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the Bills and Dolphins couldn't be closer. They split  
two games during the regular season, scoring 37 points each, and 
each team finished 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFC East rivals meet again Saturday in a wild-card playoff  
game. The NFL went to the fifth tiebreaker before determining the 
home-field advantage, which went to the Dolphins because they 
scored six more points in division games. 
</P>
<P>
	That's close.  
</P>
<P>
	But one factor favors the Bills by a lopsided margin: history.  
The teams have met in the playoffs three times this decade, and 
Buffalo ended Miami's season every time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It always seems like there's some kind of road through  
Buffalo,'' Miami tackle Richmond Webb said. ``It's starting out 
that way again this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each Buffalo victory over Miami in the playoffs has been  
decisive. The Bills ended the Dolphins' 1990 season by winning in 
the snow, 44-34, then won the AFC championship game at Miami two 
years later, 29-10. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Buffalo ended Don Shula's coaching career by beating  
the Dolphins 37-22. The Bills rushed for 341 yards that day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be able to call it forgettable,'' Miami defensive  
end Trace Armstrong said, ``but I remember it well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams have had heavy roster turnover since that game, and  
both also have a new coach. The Bills and Dolphins no longer 
dominate the AFC East, which was won by New England in 1997 and the 
New York Jets this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, with Webb, Bruce Smith, Andre Reed and Dan Marino playing  
pivotal roles Saturday, the game will have strong ties to the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always special to play against Miami,'' said Smith, the  
Bills' Pro Bowl defensive end. ``The rivalry has been going on so 
long. The fact that you have a Hall of Fame quarterback who has lit 
up this league for the past 16 years, and with the emergence of 
Jimmy Johnson as coach, it's always special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins' postseason failures against Buffalo don't faze  
Johnson because he's 6-3 against the Bills, including Super Bowl 
victories with Dallas in 1993 and 1994. But he acknowledges the 
Bills' edge in the rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's tremendous respect for Buffalo because they've had a  
lot of success, not only against the Miami Dolphins but against 
everybody in the league,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, success has been fleeting for the Bills. They  
have only one postseason victory since 1993 -- and that came against 
the Dolphins. And they've lost four consecutive regular-season 
games at Miami, including a 13-7 defeat in September during the 
Bills' 0-3 start. 
</P>
<P>
	That was before Doug Flutie took over at quarterback.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're a completely different team now,'' Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
	In the rematch at Buffalo Nov. 1, Flutie rallied the Bills from  
a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit to win 30-24. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference is the first game was here and the second game  
was there,'' Miami receiver Oronde Gadsden said. ``The crowd was a 
big factor in both games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The home field makes the Dolphins three-point favorites  
Saturday. Miami cornerback Terrell Buckley said the road to the 
Super Bowl no longer goes through Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going through Miami now,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	And as far as Buckley and his teammates are concerned, the  
Bills' postseason domination of the Dolphins is history.

	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The 110th Tournament of Roses closed out  
the 20th century with the roar of a squadron of Navy fighter jets 
buzzing over the floral New Year's Day spectacle that looked back

<HEADLINE> Seminoles Defenders Share Bond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- On Thanksgiving Day, Florida State safety  
Dexter Jackson's mother received a long-awaited kidney transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Jackson and linebacker Lamont Green hope Green's mother is  
next. 
</P>
<P>
	Their shared wait over the past four years created a special  
bond between the two seniors that Jackson said is an extension of 
the close relationship among the entire defensive team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We show each other we're here for one another,'' Jackson said  
Friday. ``If you're here for one another off the field, how do you 
think you'll play on the field when everybody's together?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their performance on the field Monday in the Fiesta Bowl against  
top-ranked Tennessee (12-0) could mean a national championship for 
No. 2 Florida State (11-1). 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's mother, Lula Lee of Quincy, Fla., had been waiting  
five years for a new kidney. The surgery was performed less than a 
week after the Seminoles ended their regular season by defeating 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a lot off my mind,'' Jackson said. ``When I was  
playing last year and again this season I was thinking in the back 
of my mind, `How is my mom doing? Is she going to be OK?' 
</P>
<P>
	``But now that she has the transplant and she's doing well, I  
can take that extra drain off my mind and focus on my game plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She had gone to Shands Medical Center in Gainesville in 1997  
only to find the donor kidney was not a proper match. Another 
attempt was called off because she had the flu and the risk of 
infection would have been too great. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson picked her up from the hospital Dec. 5, the same day  
Florida State was thrust into the Bowl Championship Series title 
game by the upset losses of UCLA and Kansas State. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mom received the transplant, these two teams lose and we're  
going to play for the championship,'' Jackson said. ``Destiny has 
prevailed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said in a telephone interview that she was doing fine and  
along with other family members will be watching her son play on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means a lot to me,'' she said. ``I'm proud of him because  
he had to work so hard to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emma Green will be watching from her home in Miami. She received  
a transplant in 1994 but it did not take and the kidney had to be 
removed. Green said his mother is due to get another transplant 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a distraction at first,'' Green said. ``Now, I've  
learned to deal with it. We learned to laugh and joke about a lot 
more things and don't take them so serious because it's a situation 
that's out of our control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green called his mother his ``backbone.''  
</P>
<P>
	``She supports me so much in everything that I try to do,'' he  
said. ``She wants for us to bring home this national championship 
and that's what I want to do for her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green and Jackson often talk about their mothers.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sometime's he'll call and say, `Dex, my mom's not doing so  
well.' '' Jackson said. ``It's a brother-to-brother thing. I try to 
make him feel comfortable and at home whenever he needs me. He does 
the same thing.''

<HEADLINE> Jackson Calls His Final Rose Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Keith Jackson, whose trademark ``Whoa  
Nellie'' has punctuated college football telecasts on ABC for 26 
years, broadcast his final Rose Bowl on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, 70, will retire after calling the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe,  
Ariz., on Monday night. His finale will be Tennessee and Florida 
State playing for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The UCLA marching band paid tribute to Jackson by spelling out  
``KEITH'' on the field before the Bruins played Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's retirement was announced over the public address  
system during the game and fans responded with cheers. The 
stadium's big screen showed Jackson with his headset on in the 
broadcast booth, but he was busy working and didn't wave to the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson has said he's retiring because he doesn't see as well as  
he used to, and that it's harder to walk up the steps to the press 
box. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked Friday's game with his partner of 12 years, Bob  
Griese.

<HEADLINE> Field Workers' Son Now Nev. Gov. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- As the son of poor fruit-pickers, Kenny  
Guinn bounced between nearly 30 schools and once lived in a tin 
shack as his parents followed the crops through California, Oregon 
and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he'll make his biggest move yet: into the Nevada  
governor's mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Guinn, 62, is the state's first Republican governor in 16 years.  
He's a millionaire whose candidacy was so heavily backed by 
big-money casino interests that a columnist dubbed him ``the 
anointed one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like so many other families in the Depression, the Guinns  
crammed into a Model A Ford and left their home in Garland, Ark., 
in hopes of making a living in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've seen 'Grapes of Wrath.' Our car wasn't loaded down like  
that, but it was crowded,'' Guinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guinn's mother had a third-grade education and his father was  
illiterate, but the couple made sure their children started school 
soon after they arrived in the San Joaquin Valley in the early 
1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter where we went, my parents always made sure we went  
to school, even if sometimes it was a short period of time,'' Guinn 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	He remembers the prejudice toward ``Okies'' and ``Arkies'' as he  
lived with his parents, older brother and two younger sisters in a 
poor area near Exeter, Calif. But he also remembers the way people 
in Exeter helped him realize a dream of moving up and out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew full well I wanted to do something besides what my  
family had been doing all those years,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Help came in many forms, including a job pumping gas and a  
family to live with during the school year while his parents picked 
fruit elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	A classmate's father who was head of the local school board  
helped him get college-track classes during high school, instead of 
the agriculture, wood shop and auto shop courses he was initially 
pushed toward. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports helped too. At age 14, he was 160 pounds, nearly six feet  
tall, and athletic. His coaches encouraged him, and he became a 
standout in most sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I got into athletics, I became very competitive in school  
and things in general in my life,'' he says. ``And I felt I could 
do whatever it was that I took off to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An honor student, Guinn got a college football scholarship,  
married his high school sweetheart, Dema, graduated and worked as a 
teacher and coach in Visalia and San Jose, Calif., from 1960 to 
1964. He moved to Las Vegas to take a low-level education 
administration post, continued with postgraduate studies and in 
1969 became superintendent of schools there. 
</P>
<P>
	Guinn left the school district in 1978 to become a bank  
executive and later became a utility executive. He also served as 
interim president of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, before 
deciding to run for governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's in a world that he couldn't have imagined as a boy:  
Silver-haired, handsome and well-spoken, with a personal net worth 
of more than $5 million, politically connected even before snaring 
the governor's office, a winner in his first bid for an elective 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Guinn has taken an active role in campaigns for both GOP and  
Democratic candidates since working on Paul Laxalt's gubernatorial 
campaign in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't until 1996 that he decided to run himself. He  
started right away, got early commitments for contributions and 
easily won the GOP primary last September after a rough-and-tumble 
campaign against former Hollywood film producer Aaron Russo and 
others. He then defeated the Democratic nominee, Las Vegas Mayor 
Jan Jones, in November. 
</P>
<P>
	His parents saw his early successes before they died. A sister  
and brother will be on hand to see his latest as he is sworn in as 
Nevada's 28th governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very fortunate,'' Guinn says. ``I never thought about it.  
I just tried to be as good as I could be in every job I ever had. I 
always figured that if you worked hard and treated people like 
you'd like to be treated, they'd take care of you. And it's always 
worked well for me.''

<HEADLINE> Student Journalist Didn't Libel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A judge threw out a libel suit filed against a  
student journalist by a Wellesley College African studies professor 
who stirred controversy by claiming Jewish influence on the media 
led to negative publicity for him. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ruling made public Thursday, Superior Court Judge Judith  
Fabricant dismissed the case brought by Wellesley professor Anthony 
Martin over a 1993 article by Avik Roy. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin -- who had been the center of a school controversy when he  
accused Wellesley of participating in a ``Jewish attack on black 
progress''-- sued Roy in 1993 after Roy's story appeared in the 
student-run magazine Counterpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	The story focused on an encounter between Martin and a Wellesley  
student who accused the professor of verbally assaulting her, using 
foul language. In his story, which relied on unidentified sources, 
Roy alleged that the college tried to keep the complaint quiet and 
tried to stop the college's newspaper from printing interviews with 
Martin and the student. 
</P>
<P>
	But only one paragraph was deemed libelous by Martin: one that  
suggested the professor was given tenure at Wellesley after he sued 
the school for race discrimination. In fact, Martin had received 
tenure before he sued the college over a merit increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabricant ruled that, though the paragraph contained the error,  
the story was ``substantially true.'' She also ruled that Martin 
didn't suffer any harm to his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin did not return calls seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Roy, who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of  
Technology and now attends Yale Medical School, said he hoped the 
ruling would encourage other college journalists to write tough 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my main concerns with this whole case was that it would  
exercise a chilling effect on college journalists,'' he said. 
``They'd be scared they would expose themselves to the risk of 
lawsuits any time someone didn't agree with how they were 
covered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, a professor of what Wellesley calls Africana studies,  
became the center of a heated controversy on the campus in 1992 
when he assigned his students a Nation of Islam-published book 
called ``The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews'' that 
argued Jewish people were deeply involved in the slave trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of Wellesley students and alumnae protested the use of  
the book which they called anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin responded in December 1993 by publishing his own  
pamphlets and eventually a book called ``The Jewish Onslaught: 
Despatches from the Wellesley Battlefront,'' which said Jewish 
influence on the media led to negative publicity for him. Roy 
himself is not Jewish.

<HEADLINE> Vols Hope Conditioning Will Pay Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Nebraska gave Tennessee a year-long homework  
assignment last January in the Orange Bowl. Get stronger, get in 
better condition, or forget about playing at this level. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 Volunteers (12-0) take the final exam against Florida  
State in the Fiesta Bowl on Monday with the national title at 
stake. They expect the bottom line answer won't come until the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 2 Florida State (11-1) prides itself on playing a lot of  
people on defense to keep them fresh. Thirty-one Seminoles 
defenders played in nine or more games this year, and 19 played in 
all 12. 
</P>
<P>
	It has paid off. Florida State ranks second in the country in  
scoring defense (11.5 points a game), and is particularly tough the 
last two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles gave up just 45 second-half points (33 percent of  
their total), and they blanked six oppponents after halftime, 
including bowl teams Texas A&AMP;M, Georgia Tech, Virginia, and 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last three games, the Seminoles have given up a mere  
seven second-half points. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first half last year we played Nebraska pretty well,  
but the second half they just overpowered us,'' cornerback Steve 
Johnson said. ``It seemed like they had an extra kick we didn't 
have. We worked on that in the offseason and I think it's paid 
dividends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive guard Cosey Coleman said correcting the deficiency  
started immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``The morning we got back from the bowl game, our strength and  
conditioning coach let us know we were going to focus on 
conditioning this year,'' he said. ``We ran all summer long so we 
wouldn't be out of breath and winded again in the fourth quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said handling the Seminoles' defensive depth is  
Tennessee's biggest challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've played good defensive lines before, but I don't think  
we've played a defense that rotates people in and out the way 
Florida State does,'' he said. ``We've been conditioning every day 
for this. It's going to be a big challenge for us to play 60 
minutes of Vol football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's ace in the fourth-quarter may be tailback Travis  
Henry, a power runner who seems to get better as a game goes on. He 
gained 602 of his 970 yards in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the game will be decided in the fourth quarter,'' he  
said. ``It'll be who wants the national championship the baddest.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> TV Guide Chief Steward Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- TV Guide's president and chief executive, David  
Steward, has stepped down after the pending sale of the magazine 
left his future unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Steward joined TV Guide in November 1997 with the hopes of  
extending the magazine's presence on television. But that goal was 
reached when News Corp., Rupert Murdoch's media conglomerate, 
announced in June it would sell control of TV Guide to United Video 
Satellite Group Inc. for $2 billion. The sale is expected to be 
completed in January. 
</P>
<P>
	United Video, which is controlled by cable giant  
Tele-Communications Inc., owns the Prevue Channel, a TV-listing 
cable channel seen in more than 50 million homes. Prevue will be 
renamed TV Guide Channel to take advantage of the popular brand 
name, and the company hopes the added TV exposure will help boost 
advertising at the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Steward joined TV Guide after serving as chief operating officer  
of Martha Stewart's media businesses, where he helped launch Martha 
Stewart Living Magazine in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	His resignation was announced Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	TV Guide is the nation's most widely read weekly magazine and  
the second largest consumer magazine after the monthly Reader's 
Digest.

<HEADLINE> 1999 Arrival Delayed, Just a Bit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The arrival of 1999 was postponed, just a bit.  
</P>
<P>
	The folks who keep track of time added one second to the end of  
1998 -- a leap second. 
</P>
<P>
	Such leap seconds are needed from time to time because the  
atomic clocks used to keep time are more precise than the Earth, 
which varies a bit in how fast it rotates. 
</P>
<P>
	So, to keep the clocks and the planet in synch, leap seconds are  
added to clock time. It seems easier than trying to adjust the spin 
of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The leap second was added at 7 p.m. EST, making the preceding  
minute 61 seconds long. 
</P>
<P>
	Americas timekeepers -- the National Institute of Standards and  
Technology in Boulder, Colo., and the U.S. Naval Observatory in 
Washington, D.C. -- make the adjustment 
</P>
<P>
	These seconds were introduced in 1972, when the world began  
keeping Coordinated Universal Time. Without leap seconds, after 
10,000 years or so clocks would read noon just as the sun was 
coming up. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 leap second was the 22nd one to be added. The last leap  
second was added on June 30, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Foreman-Holmes Fight Reportedly Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- They talked a good fight but the proposed bout  
between ex-heavyweight champions George Foreman and Larry Holmes 
never got any further than that. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-round match, scheduled for Jan. 23 at the Houston  
Astrodome, was called off Friday, according to Foreman's brother. 
</P>
<P>
	``George says it's off,'' Roy Foreman told The Associated Press,  
adding that promoter Roger Levitt did not meet the deadline for 
paying Foreman the remaining $9 million of his $10 million purse. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were supposed to have the money last week and they didn't  
have it,'' Roy Foreman said. ``George gave them an extra week and 
they still didn't have it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes hadn't been told that the fight was off.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what's going on,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The match, scheduled for two weeks after Foreman's 50th  
birthday, was to carry a $39.95 closed circuit television price 
tag. Holmes, who was 49 on Nov. 3, had promised it would be worth 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate George giving me the opportunity to whip on him a  
little bit,'' Holmes said, when the fight was announced in 
September. ``He says the same thing about me, so you got to buy a 
ticket to see it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be a classic, it's history. It's two men who over  
the decades never fought. Two men with lots of pride. Two men will 
give it all and only one will win. I'm sure that it will be me and 
George thinks it will be him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman, who became the oldest heavyweight champion when he  
regained the WBA crown at age 45 by knocking out Michael Moorer on 
Nov. 5, 1994, seemed anxious for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry Holmes was a second-rate fighter sparring for (Muhammad)  
Ali when I had my original career,'' he said. ``This is the only 
time this fight could be made. This is the only time it is 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 99, the combined age of the fighters was believed to be the  
highest in boxing history. Holmes' career record is 66-6 and 
Foreman's is 76-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care if we're 900 years old,'' Holmes said. ``You got  
two old guys almost the same age that are going to fight. We might 
not fight like young guys today, but we are going to fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was if the money was in place.  
</P>
<P>
	The fight ran into trouble a week ago when one of its major  
backers pulled out. Levitt claimed a replacement backer had come 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the promoter said he was going through ``financial  
machinations'' with the two fighters and that the letters of credit 
would be deposited by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had an extension for the letters of credit until the close  
of business Los Angeles time (Thursday),'' Levitt said. ``We might 
need another extension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman wasn't waiting. He received a nonrefundable $1 million  
deposit and Holmes keeps a $400,000 down payment on his $4 million 
purse.

<HEADLINE> Polluters, EPA Clean Up Riverbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an unusual partnership, environmentalists,  
polluters, local municipalities and the Environmental Protection 
Agency are working together to clear out the toxic gunk that's 
clogging the Ashtabula River near Lake Erie. 
</P>
<P>
	Their common goal is to start dredging the river without the  
years of lawsuits and studies typical of cleanups done under the 
Superfund law. 
</P>
<P>
	Layers of heavy metals and cancer-causing PCBs have contaminated  
the river-bottom silt. Dredging would not only clean up the 
pollution but accommodate more boat traffic on a channel that flows 
into Lake Erie at Ashtabula in Ohio's northeast corner. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't only an environmental issue. It is a very serious  
economics issue in this county,'' said John Mahan, coordinator of 
the Ashtabula River Partnership, a joint endeavor of 
environmentalists, polluters, regulators and municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
	The various interests were driven together by the experience of  
Fields Brook, a nearby upstream tributary that years ago was put on 
the EPA Superfund list of the nation's most pressing pollution 
problems. As with other Superfund sites, expenses have mounted and 
the actual cleanup work has been delayed. There was general 
consensus there had to be a better way. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the partnership is working.  
</P>
<P>
	All sides are sharing the cost of preparing for dredging. The  
approach is unusual at a time when industry, which ultimately is 
supposed to pick up the tab for Superfund cleanups, increasingly is 
questioning the need for cleanup dredging, and winning support for 
that skepticism in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Just this fall Congress added language to the EPA's spending  
bill urging the agency to issue no more dredging orders. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't mandatory, but ``the trend is worrisome,'' said Emily  
Green, a Great Lakes expert with the Sierra Club's Midwest office. 
``If they try to push it again next year it would really have a 
tremendous impact on the lakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Major corporations on the hook to pay for cleanups, whether by  
dredging or some other means, are banding together to investigate 
non-dredging options. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sediment Management Work Group, comprised of Alcoa, Boeing,  
DuPont, Exxon, General Electric and other big companies, was formed 
to pool scientific work, including studies of situations in which 
dredging might not be the best option. 
</P>
<P>
	That group's coordinator, Detroit lawyer Steven Nadeau, said  
industry isn't against all environmental dredging but wants other 
options considered, including letting clean silt entomb 
contaminated mud. 
</P>
<P>
	The group advocates rigorous cost-benefit analysis. For  
instance, how much would it cost to get half the pollution out and 
what would the possible health benefit be, and how much more would 
it cost to get 95 percent of the pollution out, and how much better 
would the health results be? 
</P>
<P>
	Nadeau described it as an evolution in thinking.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are some situations where dredging is the only answer,''  
he said. If other answers work in different situations, though, 
they should be considered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	From the environmentalists' point of view, that's a scary  
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Dredging often is the preferred cleanup option because it's  
permanent and prevents pollution from drifting downstream, said 
Green. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some ports, like Toledo and Green Bay, pollution from  
upstream hotspots will wash downstream and into the port if not 
removed,'' she said. ``This contamination will make it more 
difficult, expensive and time-consuming for the port to keep its 
navigation channels open.''

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Casts Shadow on 2000 Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For Al Gore, the vice president who wants to  
move into the Oval Office, Bill Clinton represents the biggest 
obstacle -- and perhaps the greatest asset -- in fulfilling that 
ambition in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment proceedings and continuing fallout from the  
Monica Lewinsky affair have drowned out numerous attempts by Gore 
to develop his own message. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal has forced Gore to delay plans to step out on his  
own, because it might look disloyal to distance himself from 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore downplays such analysis, telling The Associated Press in a  
recent interview: ``Since I have not announced (as a presidential 
candidate), there has been no impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore mailed official papers Friday to the Federal Election  
Commission, however, establishing a presidential campaign committee 
for the 2000 election, his staff chief, Ron Klain, said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the plus side, the economy has remained vibrant under Clinton  
and pocketbook issues resonate with voters. The president's job 
approval ratings continue at high levels. And Clinton's strong 
political network stands ready to mobilize for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the vice president will have to fight for the Democratic  
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, a potential Gore rival, has  
earned his fair share of loyalty points. He held Democratic 
lawmakers in line against impeachment and delivered a rare 
impassioned floor speech on the day of the historic vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt, more liberal than Gore, may opt out of the race and  
remain in the House, where he could become speaker if Democrats 
pick up six seats in 2000 congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey could emerge as a  
powerful alternative to Gore. Bradley retains the allure of his 
basketball career with the New York Knicks, though he is considered 
an uninspiring speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota is running on the left end of  
the spectrum. Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts and civil rights 
activist Jesse Jackson also are considering bids. One potentially 
strong challenger, Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, decided not to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking far into the election season, some Democrats worry that  
the Lewinsky issue will hurt their presidential nominee, 
particularly if Gore is the pick. He was intensely loyal to 
Clinton, issuing statements of support a dozen times during the 
week of the House impeachment vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans are tired of the scandal and may turn away from any  
reminder of the Clinton-Gore administration, some party officials 
say privately. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't buy that,'' Gore adviser Bob Squier said recently.  
``The president's (poll) numbers and vice president's numbers have 
never been better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore allies say they are more concerned about the economy than  
scandal. As long as voters feel good about where the country is 
headed, they will back Clinton and his vice president, the allies 
contend. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's loyalty throughout the Lewinsky scandal may pay off in  
the short run, as he navigates the field of Democratic challengers 
for the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic activists are riled up over what they believe is a  
partisan attack on Clinton. Many have noticed that Gore is leading 
the charge to defend him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody wants the president impeached, but this has helped Gore  
strengthen his standing among rank and file Democrats,'' said New 
Hampshire Democratic Party chairman Jeff Woodburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said ``it will be for others to determine'' whether the  
scandal helps him weather the primaries. He did predict that no 
Democrat will run away from Clinton in the presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any Democrat in 2000 will be wise to run a campaign premised  
on the success of the Clinton-Gore administration,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore will jump into the race with the full weight of the White  
House behind him. His campaign manager, White House political 
director Craig Smith, is an Arkansas native who brings the 
successful Clinton political network to Gore's operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Whouley, a Clinton backer and one of the party's most  
respected tacticians, will run Gore's political operation for the 
primaries. The vice president also can expect backing from many 
Democratic mayors, governors and other elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
	He should easily raise $20 million, the goal of most  
presidential candidates, even with the lingering shadow of 
questionable 1996 fundraising. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Gore is standing by the president at every turn.  
</P>
<P>
	Introducing the impeached president in the Rose Garden last  
month, Gore said, ``There is no doubt in my mind that the verdict 
of history will undo the unworthy judgment rendered a short while 
ago in the U.S. Capitol.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time will tell whether Gore will soon find his place in history.

<HEADLINE> Electronics Switching to Digital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The cool new high tech gadget everyone's  
talking about these days is something we've been watching in our 
living rooms for almost 60 years. But in 1999, say consumer 
electronics aficionados, television gets a whole new look. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new digital television is not your grandfather's  
television,'' said Jeff Joseph, vice president of the Consumer 
Electronics Manufacturers Association in Arlington, Va. ``It's 
amazing. It has an enormous 'Wow!' factor. Any time consumers see 
it, their eyes pop out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Television viewers may think that their football game, soap  
opera or science show looks fine as it is. But when a show is 
broadcast digitally onto a high definition television, the action 
appears disturbingly lifelike, nearly three-dimensional. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the high definition digital television debuted Nov. 1,  
its introduction as a mainstream consumer item comes Jan. 7 to Jan. 
10 at the 1999 International Consumer Electronics Show in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	There, among the 90,000 product developers, financiers,  
investors, venture capitalists, reporters, exhibitors and actual 
consumers, the crisp and clear digital televisions and their makers 
are expected to be the darlings of the world's largest annual trade 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people may have heard of digital television, but at  
CES they're finally going to see it,'' said Kevin Hause, analyst 
with International Data Corp. of Framingham, Mass. ``It's finally 
time for consumers to get a really good look at them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Television stations in more than 40 cities are now airing  
high-definition broadcasts, but most Americans are missing the show 
because they haven't been willing to shell out the $5,000 to 
$12,000 for a new set and tuner that show the brighter, 
crystal-clear images. Prices, though, are expected to drop 10 to 20 
percent in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	While televisions are the biggest item making the high-tech  
shift, technology is also making a leap in other consumer goods 
such as telephones and VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears we're going to go through an evolution from analog  
to digital,'' said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, 
Inc. in Campbell, Calif. ``It's a fascinating change, and certainly 
the buzz of industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Electricity travels through either analog or digital signals.  
Analog signals are generated directly, like a light hitting a 
camera picture tube. They can be converted into digital signals 
that are composed entirely of ones and zeros. A lot more can be 
done with digital information because it can be manipulated by 
computers and is more immune to noise. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, digital VCRs can now record on a hard drive instead  
of cassettes, a function that allows television watchers to set up 
their own instant replays and pauses during broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital video discs play both music and movies on a five-inch  
disc with CD-quality sound. And digital telephones can package 
Caller ID and an answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
	With the touch of a button, users of digital camcorders can  
create special effects including fade, dissolve and scroll up or 
down. And digital audio is bringing movie theater-like surround 
sound into the living room. 
</P>
<P>
	The new technologies are expected to help the electronics  
industry continue its strong and steady growth. In 1998, consumer 
electronics companies sold $76 billion of products to retailers, up 
$4 billion from 1997, according to the consumer electronics 
association.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Sees Setback in Campaign Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a setback for the Justice Department's  
campaign fund-raising investigation, a federal judge has dismissed 
much of the case against a Thai businesswoman who raised 
substantial funds for the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman on Thursday threw out 11  
counts against Pauline Kanchanalak, a key figure in the 
investigation of foreign money raised in the 1996 Clinton-Gore 
re-election campaign. The ruling left seven of the original 24 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had dropped six charges against Ms. Kanchanalak last  
fall after the judge raised legal concerns about those counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman's ruling Thursday followed earlier decisions that threw  
out much of the Justice Department's cases against two other 
defendants in the foreign money probe, Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie and 
Maria Hsia. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of Republican lawmakers have urged Attorney General  
Janet Reno to recommend an independent counsel to investigate the 
Clinton-Gore money-raising effort, including the roles of the 
president and vice president. After conducting preliminary 
inquiries, she concluded the step was not warranted. She still is 
conducting a preliminary investigation on seeking a counsel to 
investigate former White House aide Harold Ickes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kanchanalak was indicted last summer on charges of illegally  
channeling $659,000 to the Democratic Party. Trial is scheduled for 
March 8 for Ms. Kanchanalak and her sister-in-law, Duangnet 
``Georgie'' Kronenberg, on allegations they conspired to direct 
illegal donations to the Democratic National Committee and 
Democratic candidates from 1992 to 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman threw out allegations that they filed false statements  
with the Federal Election Commission, ruling that prosecutors 
failed to show they had any significant role in the submission of 
statements to the FEC by the Democratic organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	He also found that the newly dismissed counts were nearly  
indistinguishable from the dismissed allegations at issue in the 
Trie and Hsia cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In those earlier rulings, the judge found that citizens of  
foreign countries are prohibited only from making donations that 
directly support individual candidates -- contributions known as 
``hard'' money. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the foreign donations to the Clinton-Gore campaign  
involved ``soft'' money, which is used for general purposes such as 
political advertising and voter registration. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC returned $253,000 raised by Ms. Kanchanalak, and denied  
knowing the money was improper.

<HEADLINE> Flowery Flashback for Rose Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- With everything from a flyby of fighter  
jets to a sobering tribute to the city of Jerusalem, the 110th Rose 
Parade saluted the 20th century as thousands watched under 
brilliant skies. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-two marching bands and 25 equestrian units on the ground  
were joined by Navy aviators in the sky to entertain 750,000 people 
along the 5 1/2-mile parade route, while 450 million people in 102 
countries watched the New Year's Day spectacle on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing! Ten times better in person,'' said ``7th  
Heaven'' TV actress Beverley Mitchell as she jockeyed for a 
curbside view and aromatic sniff of 56 ``Echoes of the 
Century''-themed floats covered with flowers, leaves, grass, seeds 
and spices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance entered  
``Jerusalem, City of Peace'' in honor of the holy city's three 
religious traditions of Judaism, Islam and Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	The 55-foot-long float had a floral replica of Jerusalem's  
Western Wall containing some 10,000 messages from school children 
from around the world. The notes will be sent to Jerusalem to be 
wedged into the actual wall, following age-old custom. 
</P>
<P>
	``With what's going on in the Middle East, we thought we should  
remind the world that Jerusalem is the home of the world's great 
religions and it was a time to pray for Jerusalem,'' said Rabbi 
Marvin Hier of the Wiesenthal Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The grandstands contained a sea of Wisconsin red sweatshirts  
worn by fans in town for the afternoon Rose Bowl college football 
game against UCLA, which Wisconsin won 38-31.

<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Florida State defenders say they have been  
pulling together since the Seminoles' only loss after hearing 
defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews' rope story. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews stopped at a hardware store and bought a length of rope  
as a visual prop for his tale about the rescue of a mountain 
climber. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's holding onto a limb or something and he knows he's going  
to fall to his death, about a 10,000-foot drop to the bottom,'' 
Andrews recalled during a news conference Friday. ``I said, `If you 
were in that situation, look around this room and see who you would 
want to have at the other end of that rope.' 
</P>
<P>
	``And so they looked around a little bit, looked at each other.  
You could see that there were more people in there that trusted the 
people with them than were afraid they'd turn it loose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Lamont Green said the story may have been corny but  
it worked. The Seminoles did not lose again and ended the season 
leading the nation in defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really gets deep into your soul,'' Green said. ``That kept  
us together a lot after the game. You can see a guy down in the 
street doing something wrong and you can just look up and say, `All 
right, now you've got to hold up your end of the rope.' And that's 
that. Guys really felt what that meant.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PARTY POOPERS:* Most Florida State players stayed in their  
hotel on New Year's Eve after team captains and coach Bobby Bowden 
agreed to put the annual Fiesta Bowl Block Party, featuring a 
variety of musical groups, off limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's people drinking everywhere,'' defensive captain Lamont  
Green said. ``You never know. You might get a Tennessee fan who 
just wants to take a shot at a Florida State guy to get him kicked 
out of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The restriction didn't bother cornerback Mario Edwards, who said  
he was in bed by 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't come up here, really, to party,'' Edwards said. ``I  
came down to do business. I'll feel better going home with the 
national championship than going home thinking I had a great time 
for New Year's.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO TAKERS:* Ticket brokers are complaining that Fiesta Bowl  
business has been slow and they blame an unexpected guest -- Florida 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	They had been banking on an undefeated UCLA or Kansas State  
meeting top-ranked Tennessee (12-0). Final game losses by those 
would-be national champions, however, sent the Seminoles (11-1) to 
Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is that no one expected Florida State to sneak in  
like this,'' Marty Fettman, spokesman for Ticket Connection in 
Phoenix, told The Arizona Republic. ``This just isn't the right 
matchup, at least for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some resellers say they already are buying tickets at their $135  
face value from speculators. Reed Simon, owner of Team One Tickets 
and Sports Tours in Tempe, said wouldn't even buy at below face 
value because he didn't ``want to get stuck with more than 20 
tickets come game day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ticketless fans from Florida, where reselling, or scalping,  
tickets is illegal, have been unwilling to pay inflated prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon said Tennessee fans had purchased 476 of the 500 tickets  
he had sold as of Thursday. Only 18 went to Floridians but even 
more depressing, he said, is that Arizona residents bought only 
six. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been absolutely no local interest,'' Simon said.  
``You need two unbeatens ... but neither of them can be from 
Florida because those schools are the weakest at sending people.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PEERLESS PRACTICE:* Tennessee's star wide receiver, Peerless  
Price, likely will find himself covered by Florida State cornerback 
Mario Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far they haven't really said, `Mario, you're on Peerless  
Price,''' Edwards said. ``Toward the latter part of practice, coach 
told me he wanted me to follow 37 on the practice squad around. 
Maybe that's an indication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price wears No. 37.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great receiver,'' Edwards said. ``He can hurt you deep.  
He can catch a short pass and turn it into a long pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, who led the Seminoles with six interceptions and 11  
pass breakups, said he has '' matched up against receivers like 
Peerless Price pretty good this year. I've been pretty successful. 
It's just going to be a great battle between me and that guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PRACTICE WAS PERFECT:* Randy Sanders, Tennessee's new offensive  
coordinator, said he saw only the end of his predecessor's debut as 
a coach on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders succeeds David Cutcliffe, who left Tennessee for  
Mississippi a month ago and coached his first game Thursday night, 
a 35-18 Independence Bowl victory over Texas Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watching a little Florida State film and (defensive  
coordinator) Mickey Andrews' expertise, and lost track of the 
time,'' Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent the night practicing making play calls, which he will  
do for real for the first time in Monday night's Fiesta Bowl 
against the Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how he did, he said: ``I made a lot of good calls,'' and  
laughed. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HE'S FAST:* The longstanding debate between Tennessee running  
back Travis Henry and quarterback Tee Martin over whether Henry has 
breakaway speed has apparently been settled in Henry's favor. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin has teased Henry all year about being so slow he had to  
look for somebody to run into instead of trying to run away from 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to call him `The Barge,''' Martin said. ``He moves kind  
of slow and just sort of hmmmmmmmmms along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But after watching Henry outrun some Vanderbilt players in the  
season finale, Martin said he changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Travis is faster than I thought he was,'' Martin admitted  
Friday. ``He's not that quick, but he covers some ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin made it a point to note that Henry is still nowhere as  
fast as the Volunteers quarterback, however. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO HISTORY:* Tennessee and Florida State have only played once,  
a 10-0 Seminoles victory in 1958. Martin said the lack of a history 
is meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't have to be a rivalry,'' Tennessee quarterback Tee  
Martin said. ``It's the national championship. That's all you have 
to say. It's something out there for us to grab and they're trying 
to grab the same thing, and only one team can win. I don't care if 
its Tupelo Mississippi University. This is for the national 
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols and Seminoles do have one thing in common, however.  
Neither is at all fond of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``For real,'' Martin laughed. ``I know Steve Spurrier is having  
a hard time dealing with the Fiesta Bowl hype.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Eastern Ky. Coach Dead at 89 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Ky. (AP) -- Paul McBrayer, Eastern Kentucky  
University's winningest basketball coach, died Friday after a 
battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	McBrayer coached the team from 1946 to 1962, compiling a record  
of 219-144. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach McBrayer will be remembered for his outstanding record,  
his competitive spirit and the tremendous impact he had on the 
lives of his players and associates,'' EKU president Bob Kustra 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	McBrayer was inducted into the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame in  
1987. The Eastern arena inside Alumni Coliseum was named for him 
and dedicated 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He was an Anderson County native and a 1930 All-America guard at  
the University of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first year at Eastern, with practically an all-freshman  
team, McBrayer won 11 straight games and the team finished with a 
21-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
	During his time at Eastern, the school won two Ohio Valley  
Conference titles and made two trips to the NCAA tournament, losing 
to Notre Dame and Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his widow, Katie.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Holds Annual Auto Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit's annual fashion show -- complete with  
runways, models and an endless array of curvaceous sheet metal -- 
arrives just as the U.S. auto industry celebrates the end of its 
fifth straight year of strong sales and healthy profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts expect final sales figures to show U.S. light  
vehicle sales hit a 10-year high of more than 15.4 million in 1998. 
They'll know for sure when figures are released next week during 
the North American International Auto Show's media preview. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry's health is reflected in the millions of dollars  
automakers are spending on new displays aimed at attracting the 
nearly 6,000 automotive journalists and photographers expected to 
show up starting Sunday for the four-day preview. 
</P>
<P>
	The preview is a show within a show: Top executives from most of  
the world's major automakers make their annual pilgrimage to 
Detroit to make announcements, unveil new vehicles, submit to 
countless interviews, attend receptions and sometimes make deals. 
</P>
<P>
	The genesis of last year's merger of Chrysler Corp. and  
Germany's Daimler-Benz AG was a meeting of the companies' top 
executives during the Detroit show. 
</P>
<P>
	The public will get its chance to tour the displays Jan. 9-18.  
They'll see dozens of new models displayed for the first time, 
including the first 2000s, as well as the usual array of futuristic 
concept cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	With every square inch of Detroit's Cobo Center overtaken by the  
show, automakers are expanding their displays upward. Ford Motor 
Co.'s new display is billed as Detroit's largest ever. It links the 
Ford, Lincoln-Mercury, Mazda, Jaguar and Aston-Martin brands in one 
corner of the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	It's so big that workers began assembling it Nov. 16.  
</P>
<P>
	According to Ford and Exhibit Works, a company that designs and  
build auto show displays, the exhibit contains 200 tons of 
structural steel, 6,000 square feet of tinted green glass, includes 
a bridge as long as a football field, a pond, a 350-seat theater, 
two elevators and an escalator. It will cover more than 101,000 
square feet on two levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford says it wants the display's design to communicate each  
brand's ``personality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the world to know that we're more than just a great  
manufacturer,'' said Bob Rewey, Ford vice president of marketing 
and sales. ``We're also a great marketer. We believe this new 
display provides a visual statement of that very message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 48 automakers and suppliers with displays at this year's  
show, 20 will have two-level displays, or double deckers as they're 
known in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Subaru is creating a Pennsylvania forest for its display,  
complete with 25-foot trees, a waterfall, pond and wafting forest 
scents. ``Each sense will be tantalized through the use of scent 
machines, sound effects and tactile stimuli,'' promised Robert G. 
Vallee Jr., chief executive of exhibit-maker George P. Johnson Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saab exhibit will feature a ``postmodern ice castle'' with  
60 tons of ice within a raised glass floor on which the cars will 
be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	New technology is always part of the show. Cadillac's new  
exhibit will feature a display with a split-screen view that 
contrasts how a night driving scene would look with and without 
Cadillac's thermal-imaging technology called ``Night Vision.'' GM 
plans to offer the system as an option on its DeVille sedan in the 
2000 model year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford will show a concept fuel-cell car as a hologram. The  
hologram, projected on a 40-square-foot panel, will give showgoers 
the opportunity to see the kind of technology automakers plan to 
use to design cars and trucks in the future. Designers already use 
virtual reality and 3D computer software extensively. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year about 791,000 people attended the show, along with  
5,906 journalists and photographers from 67 countries. Attendance 
is expected to top 800,000 this year.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Greg Kinnear may not be as square as the  
typewriter-using columnist he plays in the new romantic comedy 
``You've Got Mail,'' but he says he's a far cry from a cyber geek 
in real life. 
</P>

	Kinnear says in an interview scheduled to air Monday on NBC's  
``Access Hollywood'' that while he's checked out some chat rooms, 
you're not likely to find him on one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've done the math and the average chat room user can type  
over 65,000 words a minute and I can't compete with that so I'm 
staying out of the rooms,'' Kinnear joked.

	Snow Clouds Gather Over Midwest  
</P>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Midwesterners have been spending New Year's  
Day at supermarkets and hardware stores, stocking up for a storm 
expected to dump more than a foot of snow. Several inches of snow 
had already fallen in parts of the Plains. In Missouri, the new 
year brought a combination of snow, sleet, ice and freezing that 
made things a mess for holiday travelers. At least two people were 
killed in a weather-related accident today on Interstate 80 in 
Nebraska as freezing drizzle and up to 3 inches of snow combined to 
make roads extremely slick.

	Justice Campaign Probe Dealt Blow  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a setback for the Justice Department's  
campaign fund-raising investigation, a federal judge has dismissed 
much of the case against a Thai businesswoman who raised 
substantial funds for the Democratic Party. U.S. District Judge 
Paul L. Friedman yesterday threw out 11 counts against Pauline 
Kanchanalak, a key figure in the investigation of foreign money 
raised in the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election campaign. The ruling 
followed earlier decisions that threw out much of the Justice 
Department's cases against two other defendants in the foreign 
money probe.

	8 Killed in Quebec Avalanche

<P>
	KANGIQSUALUJJUAQ, Quebec (AP) -- An avalanche swept down on a New  
Year's celebration in an Inuit village today, killing at least 
eight people and injuring 25 after it smashed through a gymnasium 
wall, police said. Six people died shortly after the avalanche and 
two other victims -- a mother and her young daughter -- were 
discovered several hours later buried under tons of snow, police 
said. A boy was still missing.

	Khmer Rouge May Expose U.S. Ties  
</P>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Any trial of Khmer Rouge defectors  
who may soon face charges of crimes against humanity may expose the 
roles of the United States and China in the movement's brutal rise 
to power, an aide to one defector said. ``Implementing a trial 
would also involve the 200 days and nights of bombing in 
Cambodia,'' aide Long Norin said in reference to the U.S. carpet 
bombing of Cambodia in the early 1970s. Earlier today, Cambodian 
Prime Minister Hun Sen said Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, members of 
Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot's inner circle during the group's brutal 
1975-79 rule, must be tried for genocide.

	Angola Accuses Rebels of Detention  
</P>
<P>
	LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- UNITA rebels in Angola are holding  
survivors from a U.N.-chartered plane that went down last week, an 
army spokesman claimed today. Brig. Manuel Jota did not say how 
many of the 14 people aboard had survived, and the report could not 
be independently confirmed, but he did say captured rebels had told 
the army they shot down the plane, and that an unknown number of 
survivors were being held at rebel bases in Angola's highlands. 
There were eight U.N. peacekeepers and six others on board the 
C-130 that crashed Saturday over the war zone, 10 minutes after 
takeoff.

modernizing the economy while battling the country's deep social 
inequality. Cardoso was sworn in for his second four-year term in a 
ceremony in the capital, Brasilia. He is the first Brazilian 
president to take advantage of a 1997 constitutional change 
allowing the head of state to serve a second term.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago now ranks as the nation's murder capital  
for 1998 despite experiencing a 10-year low in murders, according 
to preliminary data gathered from cities across America. Chicago 
had 698 homicides in 1998, surpassing New York City's homicide 
totals for the first time ever. Although the city's violent crime 
rate has dropped consistently in last decade (it dropped 20 percent 
overall between 1990 and 1997), it still lags behind the other

<HEADLINE> Capers Interested in Bears Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Dom Capers, fired by the Carolina Panthers two  
years after winning NFC Coach of the Year honors, is interested in 
the Chicago Bears' vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a detailed program that I think is proven and I know  
one thing: I'm a better coach now than I was four years ago,'' 
Capers told the Chicago Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	Capers was one of five coaches fired this week, a list that  
included the Bears' Dave Wannstedt, who had only two winning 
seasons in six years and made the playoffs only once. 
</P>
<P>
	Capers led the Panthers to a 12-4 record in 1996, their second  
year of existence, and into the NFC title game where they lost to 
Green Bay. Carolina's record slipped to 7-9 the following season 
and to 4-12 this season -- the same mark the Bears had the past two 
years under Wannstedt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody respects what we did here, going from no  
players to within a game of the Super Bowl,'' Capers said. ``In 
1995, I got three coach of the years (awards). The next year, I got 
them all. You don't get dumb all of a sudden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Haslett, defensive coordinator for the Pittsburgh Steelers,  
also is expected to interview with the Bears, according to Friday's 
Chicago Sun-Times. The former Pro Bowl linebacker with the Buffalo 
Bills interviewed Wednesday with the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Bears linebacker and Hall of Famer Mike Singletary also  
has expressed interest, although he has no coaching experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Bears president Michael McCaskey will make the final decision.

<HEADLINE> Man Indicted by Bombing Jury Speaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- An Oklahoma City man said he was the person  
indicted by a grand jury investigating the federal building bombing 
for allegedly attempting to influence the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	David Hoffman told the Tulsa World in Saturday's editions he is  
on a deferred sentence on a stalking charge and was concerned that 
the new indictment could result in a lengthy jail stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can't work out some reasonable terms with the district  
attorney, I am not surrendering,'' the Oklahoma City man told the 
World. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oklahoma County grand jury's investigation into the bombing  
led to one sealed indictment Wednesday and the rejection of one 
after another conspiracy theory that has persisted since the April 
19, 1995, explosion that killed 168 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury said that after hearing 117 witnesses and  
examining thousands of exhibits, ``we can state with assurance that 
we do not believe that the federal government had prior knowledge 
that this horrible terrorist attack was going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The jurors are not good people,'' Hoffman said. ``If they were  
good people, they would have returned more indictments. This is the 
biggest government coverup since the Kennedy assassination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jurors also found no credible evidence that the  
bombing was linked to white supremacists or foreign terrorists and 
they found no additional conspirators. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, author of ``The Oklahoma City Bombing and The Politics  
of Terror,'' told the World he was indicted for allegedly sending 
copies of his book to jurors during their investigation. Hoffman 
would not say whether the allegation was true. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman's book deals with various conspiracy theories and  
allegations of the federal government having prior knowledge of the 
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing.

<HEADLINE> Year 2000 Bug Felt Before '99 Dawns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Thousands of people using outdated  
accounting software in their homes or businesses run the risk of 
being bitten by the Y2K bug a year earlier than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Cougar Mountain Software Inc. of Boise rushed the newest version  
of its Act Plus accounting program to Lynn Electric on Thursday 
after the small Bluefield, W.Va., company tried to close its 1998 
payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	It was using 3 1/2-year-old software unable to translate dates that  
included the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the documents reverted to 1944,'' Cougar Mountain  
spokesman Dave Lakhani said. ``They were unable to process their 
payroll and had to order the update to correct the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the lost man hours, potentially lost data and the  
hassle of trying again to close its books over the New Year's 
holiday weekend, Lynn Electric got off cheap. The software upgrade 
cost only $400. 
</P>
<P>
	But experts estimate larger businesses and those using  
customized software could face $50,000 to $100,000 expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Hamm, president of Aim High Inc., a computer consulting  
firm in Golden, Colo., said he expects to hear similar tales of woe 
in coming days as accounting software users open 1999 financial 
calendars that typically extend 18 months -- into 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first one that I've heard, but it makes perfect  
sense,'' he said. ``Anytime that you've got something that's 
forward looking and it crosses that threshold, you've got a 
potential problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem arose when programmers of early computers  
represented each year by its last two digits rather than by all 
four -- for example, 1972 as 72 -- mostly to save computer memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble begins when computers try to add or subtract dates using  
that two-digit format and the world approaches the year 2000, or 
00. The larger, older mainframe computers still used by government 
and big corporations for many vital functions are particularly 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakhani said Cougar Mountain started notifying all its customers  
two years ago that certain software was not Y2K compliant, and 
initially offered free upgrades. Additional warnings were issued at 
least quarterly through the company's newsletter, Internet site and 
direct mail, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like so many others, Lynn Electric President Lindon Taylor said  
he did not expect it to be a problem until late 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we were thinking, when it kicked over to 2000. We  
didn't think about it happening this year,'' said Taylor, whose 
company remanufactures electrical generators and motors. 
</P>
<P>
	The company shuts its doors on New Year's Eve each year, so  
employees tried to close the annual payroll records and open a 1999 
file on Wednesday. Taylor said he thought upgraded software already 
had been installed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had checked with our bank and our financial people as best  
we could, and we thought we didn't have a problem. But we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm said the first Y2K problems actually hit almost 14 months  
ago when users of some newly issued credit cards found computers 
would not recognize expiration dates in 2000, embossed as ``00'' on 
the cards. He said it took the industry about five months to 
completely clear up the difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
	As for why Lynn Electric's computers would revert to 1944, Hamm  
said a number of personal computer programmers arbitrarily used 
that year as the start date for operating system clocks. Some PCs 
recognize no dates before 1944, he said, while most outdated 
mainframe and other larger computers simply read a date with 00 as 
1900 rather than 2000.

<HEADLINE> Vols Have New Play-Caller for Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Randy Sanders has a sense of humor. Now,  
it's time to find out if Tennessee's new offensive coordinator can 
make sense of Florida's State's ferocious defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was promoted from running backs coach two weeks ago  
after longtime assistant David Cutcliffe left to coach at 
Mississippi. His first assignment couldn't be tougher -- outsmart 
the nation's best defense in the national championship-deciding 
Fiesta Bowl Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have tendencies,'' Sanders said. ``They have a tendency  
to make people punt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, a Tennessee backup quarterback during the mid-1980s,  
has been a Vols assistant since 1991. He added the title of 
recruiting coordinator in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	All that matters now is the national title.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not nervous, but there will be a lot of anxiety about  
calling plays in a national championship game,'' Sanders said. 
``The fact that Florida State gives up only 214 yards a game 
doesn't put us at ease. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if we're prepared, there's no reason to be nervous. It's  
just a matter of calling the plays and executing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Easier said than done.  
</P>
<P>
	The second-ranked Seminoles (11-1) led the nation in overall  
defense and were second in points allowed at 11.5 per game. They 
ranked first in pass defense (135 yards per game) and second 
against the run (79.8 yards). 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Richt, Florida State's offensive coordinator, sat across  
the table from Sanders at a coaches' dinner earlier this week and 
wished his counterpart well. Richt said Sanders faces an unenviable 
task. 
</P>
<P>
	``We go against our defense all the time,'' Richt said, ``and  
the other day we were talking about there's not very many 
third-and-20 calls out there. And I don't know if there's any 
first, second or third down calls against our defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will have to play well to have success against that  
bunch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the top-ranked Volunteers (12-0) are confident Sanders'  
play-calling will work. And Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said 
he expects coach Phillip Fulmer may have more say than usual in 
running the offense Monday night. In fact, Fulmer says the Vols 
will open the game with 15 scripted plays, but will make changes if 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't remember my first game calling plays, but I know it  
wasn't the national championship game against the No. 1 defense in 
the country,'' Fulmer said. ``But Randy will be fine. If I had any 
concerns, I wouldn't have done it. I'm confident he'll do as well 
as anyone can do against the Florida State defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cutcliffe, who made a successful head coaching debut in  
Mississippi's 35-18 win over Texas Tech in the Independence Bowl 
Thursday night, will be missed. But quarterback Tee Martin says 
Sanders, who recruited many of the current players, already has the 
players' trust. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Cutcliffe was serious all the time and had a knack for  
rubbing in a mistake too much,'' Martin said. ``Coach Sanders is 
more like your favorite high school teacher. You can talk to him, 
but you still have respect for his job. He just handles it in a 
different way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, who spent New Year's eve watching Florida State game  
films, grew up near Knoxville, Tenn. After his playing days he 
became a graduate assistant, moved up to wide receivers coach in 
1991, then to running backs coach in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	With players like Jamal Lewis, Shawn Bryson and Travis Henry to  
work with, Sanders turned the Vols running game into the best in 
the Southeastern Conference. His recruiting classes have been 
ranked among the best in the nation in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it's recruiting season, Sanders has been hard at work  
searching for a flaw in the Seminoles' defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``My philosophy is you attack their weakness,'' Sanders said.  
``I just haven't found a weakness yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's got two days.

<HEADLINE> Four Dead in Conn. Wrong-Way Wreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STRATFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A pickup truck traveling the wrong way  
on Interstate 95 rammed a small car early Friday, killing all four 
people in the two vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred just after midnight, when the truck,  
traveling north in the southbound lanes, crashed head-on into a 
small Hyundai. The site was near an exit, but police said it was 
unclear whether the pickup had entered the highway there. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Flaherty, 20, his wife, Josephine, 22, and her  
3-year-old daughter, whose name was not immediately released, were 
traveling from Maine to their home in Fort Bragg, N.C., when their 
car was struck head-on, state police Sgt. Anthony Schirillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck's driver, 41-year-old Silvestre Bonilla of Bridgeport,  
was also killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests were planned on the truck driver's body to determine if  
alcohol or drugs played a role in the accident, police said.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Politics Hard on Ariz. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona could have two candidates for president  
in 2000, with Sen. John McCain all but announced and former Vice 
President Dan Quayle not far behind. 
</P>
<P>
	But the state's track record -- three unsuccessful presidential  
candidates in the last four decades -- raises questions about 
whether anyone can successfully run from a western state light on 
electoral votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pundits say the right candidate at the right time and with  
enough money could buck conventional wisdom -- and the proposed 
Rocky Mountain regional primary could only help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's an Arizona curse,'' said Henry Kenski,  
who teaches presidential campaigning at the University of Arizona. 
He said only two of three Arizona's unsuccessful candidates were 
real contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, if we go 0-for-4 then we may have to reconsider.''  
</P>
<P>
	The late Barry M. Goldwater, the first Arizonan to seek the  
presidency, was clobbered by Lyndon Johnson. He is said to have 
been asked about the notion that any child can grow up to be 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeah, Goldwater is quoted as saying by fellow election-loser Bob  
Dole, ``it's a great country where anybody can grow up to be 
president ... except me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris Udall, the state's second unsuccessful presidential  
candidate, took it a step further. He said Arizona was the only 
state where mothers don't tell their children they can grow up to 
be president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we get a bad image because of Mo's joke,'' said  
Kenski, who serves as Sen. Jon Kyl's southern Arizona chief of 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldwater, a longtime senator who won the GOP nomination 1964,  
was a sacrificial lamb, Kenski said, because no one had a chance 
against Johnson in the wake of President Kennedy's assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1976, he said, Udall was overwhelmed in a field of 13  
Democrats. There were too many fellow liberals running, leaving 
Jimmy Carter with all the moderate Democrats to himself, Kenski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One other Arizonan has made a presidential bid. Former Arizona  
governor and current Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt ran 
for the Democratic nomination in 1988 but failed to build any real 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, though, could end the state's losing streak, Kenski  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of his biggest assets is he is a very good communicator on  
TV. When you're on the talk shows, you have to sound very 
conversational. He sounds like (President) Reagan,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earl de Berge, a Phoenix pollster, said McCain has proven be a  
very hard-working candidate and has fashioned himself into a 
consumer advocate in some areas, like tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is really very popular both in Arizona and in the Rocky  
Mountain states,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain may also be helped by a proposed western regional  
primary, de Berge said. Individual state legislatures would still 
have to approve such a primary, but a number of western state 
officials have endorsed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle has said he plans to run for president in 2000 but has  
not made an official announcement. Calls to his political action 
committee, Campaign America, were not returned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He made his home in the Phoenix suburb of Paradise Valley after  
leaving office, but he already has national name recognition and a 
fairly good organization, Kenski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quayle is a lot stronger than a lot of people give him credit  
for,'' Kenski said. ``He would appeal to social conservatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Warren Rudman, the co-chair of McCain's exploratory  
committee, said McCain's record and personal integrity will help 
him overcome any disadvantage his relatively small home state gives 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``John McCain is very well know, better than most people realize  
outside Arizona,'' he said. ``We don't think there's anything wrong 
with people west of New Hampshire -- other than they wear funny hats 
and funny shoes.''

<HEADLINE> Wild Cards Opens NFL Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In a wacky NFL season that saw longtime also-rans like Atlanta  
and the New York Jets win division titles, it's only appropriate 
that the Arizona Cardinals show up in the playoffs for the first 
time since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	And if the Cardinals win their wild-card game Saturday at  
Dallas, it will be their first playoff victory since 1947, when the 
team was playing in Chicago and won the NFL championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona earned a wild-card berth in the final game of the  
regular season with a 16-13 victory over San Diego, spurred by 
safety Kwamie Lassiter, who made 11 tackles and tied an NFL record 
with four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory set off a wild demonstration by fans, celebrating  
this season's surprising success which was largely crafted by 
quarterback Jake Plummer and wide receiver Frank Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past two seasons, Plummer has rallied the Cards to nine  
wins when they were tied or behind in the fourth quarter. That 
explains the $29.7 million contract extension he signed last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Typical of what Plummer does was the final game Arizona played  
against Dallas, when he nearly wiped out a 28-0 Cowboys lead. 
Arizona lost 35-28 but Plummer passed for a season-high 465 yards 
and was throwing for the tying touchdown on the game's final play. 
Sanders caught 11 passes for 190 yards in that game and led the NFC 
with 89 receptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't get out of town fast enough,'' Dallas cornerback  
Kevin Smith said. ``The Snake gave us a scare. He has a knack for 
making things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas defensive back Deion Sanders was injured in that game and  
the Cowboys secondary has missed him since. But Dallas has its own 
offensive weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmitt Smith finished fourth in the NFC with 1,332 yards rushing  
and set a career touchdown record with 125. He always has thrived 
in the playoffs and needs 144 yards to pass Franco Harris (1,556) 
and become the career postseason rushing leader. Smith already is 
the career playoff leader with 18 TDs rushing and seven 100-yard 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Troy Aikman finished fourth in the NFC quarterback ratings with  
88.5 but is second in career playoff ratings at 96.0 and has an 
NFL-best 66.5 completion percentage in playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's other game, Buffalo plays at Miami.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, New England is at Jacksonville and Green Bay at San  
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills and Dolphins finished with identical 10-6 records and  
both were 7-4 against common opponents. The teams split their two 
regular-season meetings and four of their past five games have been 
decided by seven points or less. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills were rejuvenated by CFL refugee Doug Flutie, who  
turned out not to be too short to play in the NFL after all. His 
favorite receiver is Eric Moulds, who led the AFC with a 
team-record 1,368 yards receiving, 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's Dan Marino finished the season with three straight  
300-yard games and has 3,741 yards passing with 29 TDs in 14 career 
playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	The banged-up Patriots will start Scott Zolak at quarterback in  
place of Drew Bledsoe, out for the third straight game because of a 
fractured right index finger. Meanwhile, Mark Brunell, who missed 
three games with a sprained ankle, is expected back for 
Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	With questionable quarterbacks, this rematch of the 1996 AFC  
championship game won by New England 20-6 could come down to the 
ground game and the Jaguars appear to have the edge there. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Fred Taylor rushed for 1,223 yards and was second in the  
AFC with 17 touchdowns. Jacksonville had the third-best rushing 
offense in the conference with 131.4 yards per game. New England's 
ground game was 27th in the league, despite 1,115 yards from rookie 
Robert Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be Jacksonville's first-ever playoff game at home, where  
the Jaguars have won 21 of their last 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay and San Francisco meet in the playoffs for the fourth  
straight year. The Packers are on a roll in this rivalry, winning 
five straight, including the past three playoff meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a matchup of 4,000-yard passers. Green Bay's Brett Favre  
led the NFL with 4,212 yards and 31 touchdowns, while Steve Young 
of the 49ers finished with 4,170 yards and 36 TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both have favorite receivers. The Packers' Antonio Freeman led  
the NFL with 1,424 yards receiving and was second in the NFC with 
84 receptions. San Francisco's Jerry Rice had a big comeback 
season, finishing third in the NFC with 82 receptions and fourth 
with 1,157 yards. Rice is first on playoff career lists with 120 
catches, 1,742 yards receiving, 18 TDs receiving and seven 100-yard 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay's Reggie White, who has announced his retirement, led  
the NFL with 16 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Waiting for the wild-card winners are Atlanta, the Jets,  
Minnesota and defending Super Bowl champion Denver. They will be 
the home teams in division round playoff games next weekend.

<HEADLINE> Wash. Warning Shut U.S. Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- The closure of the U.S. Embassy in Tel  
Aviv came in response to a warning about a possible attack on the 
compound relayed from Washington and not because of a threat 
delivered locally, an Israeli security source said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The embassy was shut down Thursday and embassy spokesman Larry  
Schwartz said he did not know whether it would re-open on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz said earlier that the closure came after Ambassador Ned  
Walker received a ``direct and credible'' threat against the 
facility. Israeli police beefed up security, posting additional 
officers around the Mediterranean beachfront property. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz refused to elaborate on the nature of the threat, but  
said the closure was in line with ``actions the U.S. government has 
taken in recent weeks in light of the heightened general threats in 
the region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. diplomatic missions around the world have been on alert  
since the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, 
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in which 224 people were killed, 
including 12 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	An Israeli security source, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said the warning about a possible attack on the Tel Aviv compound 
was relayed by the U.S. State Department in a cable and not 
delivered locally in a phone call, as Israeli media have reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz refused comment on how Walker received the warning.  
</P>
<P>
	A State Department spokeswoman also said she could provide no  
further information on the nature of the threat that led to the 
embassy's closing. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli media have raised the possibility that assailants  
plotted a car bomb attack. On Thursday, Israeli and U.S. security 
officials peeked into the windows of cars in the embassy parking 
lot, but did not conduct thorough searches. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government believes the embassy bombings in East Africa  
were masterminded by Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden, 
who is based in Afghanistan, denies the charge, but says he is not 
sorry the attacks occurred.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs National Enquirer Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge refused to block publication  
of a National Enquirer story that alleges its competitor, the 
Globe, paid a former flight attendant $250,000 to set up a tryst 
with sportscaster Frank Gifford. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe sought to stop the National Enquirer story on the  
grounds that it violated the Globe's copyright and infringed on its 
trade secrets. The Globe claimed to have exclusive rights to the 
flight attendant's story. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder rejected the argument  
Thursday, saying halting publication of the Enquirer would violate 
the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a remarkable day (when) one newspaper is trying to  
enjoin another newspaper from publishing,'' Enquirer lawyer Bruce 
Wessel said during the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Enquirer story is scheduled to appear in next week's  
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe first published a story about Gifford's affair with  
former TWA flight attendant Suzen Johnson in its May 20, 1997, 
edition. Gifford is married to television personality Kathie Lee 
Gifford. 
</P>
<P>
	The Enquirer report, headlined ``Kathie Lee Shocker: Frank's  
Lover Tells All,'' reportedly quotes Ms. Johnson as saying she 
regrets the affair ever took place. 
</P>
<P>
	In court, Globe lawyers denied paying Ms. Johnson $250,000 to  
lure Gifford into a wired Manhattan hotel room. But they also 
argued that the Enquirer's report reveals a trade secret -- how much 
it pays sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a commercial effort to harm a competitor,'' said Globe  
lawyer Amy Hogue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have grave doubts as to whether the amount paid is a `trade  
secret,''' Snyder said in rejecting the Globe's request. 
</P>
<P>
	David Perel, executive editor of the Enquirer, said the ruling  
was a victory for the First Amendment. ``We will show America what 
they were trying to hide,'' Perel said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe also tried unsuccessfully to try to keep news  
reporters out of the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disinclined to do that,'' Snyder said. ``I think the  
press has a right to be here.''

<HEADLINE> 49ers' Bryant Young Heals Gradually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Bryant Young was in his room at  
Stanford Hospital a couple days after a gruesome leg fracture ended 
his season. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco 49ers defensive tackle was feeling pretty low.  
It was all starting to sink in, the extent of the injury, the 
impact on his career and the prospect of a long, difficult 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	A chance visit by former Chicago Bears player Tim Ryan helped  
him come to grips with the injury and put it in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came by, we talked and he said he was visiting his  
brother-in-law who had cancer and the doctors didn't give him long 
to live,'' Young said softly. ``I just thought to myself, when you 
think you have it the worst, somebody has it 10 times worse than 
you. That kind of woke me up a little bit. I have a lot to be 
thankful for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, making his first public appearance since breaking his leg  
Nov. 30, said Thursday his doctors have assured him he can resume 
his career and he said he's determined to play again. He hopes to 
be ready for San Francisco's opener next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt in my mind that I'll be back,'' he said.  
``I'm confident in my determination and in my love for this game, 
and with my work ethic and my will to go out there, I'm going to be 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young broke both bones in his lower right leg when he was struck  
by linebacker Ken Norton Jr.'s helmet as the two converged to make 
a tackle against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	He saw the collision coming but couldn't avoid it.  
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing happened right in front of my eyes. It was  
devastating,'' Young said. ``It's something that I really don't 
have to look at the replay to see what happened because it's 
already in my head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norton was equally devastated by his role in the injury to his  
friend and teammate, and it was Young who helped him get over it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to let him know that things like that happen, it's part  
of the game,'' Young said during a news conference at the 49ers' 
practice facility. ``I don't hold a grudge against him and I just 
reassured him that it's going to be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young said he remembers coach Steve Mariucci running onto the  
field and holding his hand, his wife coming out of the stands and 
team owner Eddie DeBartolo riding in the ambulance with him to the 
hospital. And he also remembers the sheer agony of the episode. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's pain I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy,'' Young said.  
``It was excruciating. It's something you can't explain until you 
go through it. I was just looking up to God for strength and he 
kind of pulled me through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young spent the next 17 days in the hospital and underwent three  
operations, including the insertion of a titanium rod to hold his 
shattered tibia in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for his crutches, there's little outward sign of his  
ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Young has started weight lifting to maintain his upper body  
strength and also is working on a machine to strengthen his thighs 
and hips. Because of the metal rod in his leg stabilizing the 
fracture, he doesn't need a cast but he won't be able to put any 
weight on it for about six more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	As a player, Young said it's not much fun being a spectator and  
he said not being able to play is especially frustrating now, with 
the 49ers gearing up for Sunday's wild-card game against the Green 
Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Young plans to address the team before the game, and Mariucci  
said he'll have everyone's attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not one of those rah-rah guys, so when a guy with the  
respect he does have says something, guys take it to heart,'' 
Mariucci said. ``I think he's mostly responsible for getting this 
team's dauber back up because we were borderline going in the tank 
and he didn't allow it. Geez, he had to console us at times, `Hey, 
I'm all right. Let's go.'''

<HEADLINE> Sugar Bowl Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Because the Rose Bowl ran long, the Sugar  
Bowl kickoff was delayed for 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the fans seemed to mind.  
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio State and Texas A&AMP;M bands took turns serenading the  
crowd. The Buckeyes played a number of stirring fight songs. The 
Aggies had a medley of military tunes from World Wars I and II and 
the Vietnam war. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BEEN THERE, DONE THAT:* Ohio State made its second straight  
appearance in the Sugar Bowl. Last year, the Buckeyes lost to 
Florida State 31-14. Their only other appearance was in 1978 when 
Bear Bryant and Alabama defeated Woody Hayes and the Buckeyes 35-6. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time A&AMP;M played in the Sugar Bowl was on Jan. 1, 1940.  
John Kimbrough's 159 yards rushing and two touchdowns powered A&AMP;M 
to a 14-13 victory over hometown favorite Tulane. That capped an 
11-0 season and gave the Aggies their first and only Associated 
Press national championship. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CAREER BOWL RECORDS:* Texas A&AMP;M is 12-11 in bowl games. Ohio  
State is 13-17. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach R.C. Slocum of Texas A&AMP;M (94-27-2 career) is just 2-5;  
Ohio State's John Cooper, Ohio State (177-74-6 career) is 2-7 in 
bowls. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OPPOSING STRENGTH:* Ohio State's schedule was ranked No. 42 in  
the nation and A&AMP;M's was ninth toughest. Five of the Buckeyes' 12 
opponents and seven of the Aggies' 13 earned bowl berths. Ohio 
State's opponents had a combined record of 60-52 and A&AMP;M's went 
79-51. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FLYING HIGH:* A&AMP;M came in averaging 312 yards a game in total  
offense; Ohio State came in averaging 305 just through the air. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AGENT URGENCY:* With a handful of seniors and possibly some  
underclassmen headed for the NFL draft, Ohio State coach John 
Cooper has had to handle another agent blitz at a school that over 
the years has had a No. 1 draft pick at every position except 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper sought to deal with the proliferation of agents this  
season by adding an ``Agents Day'' at the team's indoor practice 
facility to familiarize the players with agents in a face-to-face 
chat and have the agents register with the school in an effort to 
keep a handle on things. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agents are the No. 1 problem in college football,'' Cooper  
said.''We've tried to be a little more pro-active, and from this 
standpoint, I don't know if that helps us or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOUISIANA BLUES:* Louisiana may be noted for its Southern  
hospitality, but you couldn't prove it by Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. 
Slocum. 
</P>
<P>
	Slocum, a native of Oakdale, La., played college football at  
McNeese State in Lake Charles, La. 
</P>
<P>
	Slocum's last trip to the Bayou State was more memorable for  
Southwestern Louisiana than for the Aggies. Southwestern stunned 
A&AMP;M in 1996 with a 29-22 upset. The defeat ranks among the lowest 
moments in Slocum's 10-year career as the Aggies' coach. 
</P>
<P>
	It was such a big victory for Southwestern, which had never  
previously defeated a ranked team, that the school erected a 
permanent marker commemorating it at their football field.

<HEADLINE> Illinois Braces for First '99 Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- With a winter storm watch in effect, Illinois  
residents were bracing Friday for snowy, windy and potentially icy 
conditions that could mark the first big storm of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters were calling for more than a foot of snow in some  
parts of the state with the heaviest accumulations expected in 
northern and Central Illinois through Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't advise travel at all ... especially with the strong  
winds,'' said Robin Smith, a meteorologist the National Weather 
Service in Joliet. ``In relative terms, it's going to be a fairly 
powdery snow, so the strong winds are going to complicate the 
drifting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Southern Illinois warmer temperatures were expected to turn  
the snow to freezing rain, also making travel conditions dangerous 
at best. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was developing in a low pressure system in the Plains  
states and was expected to blanket much of the heartland, Smith 
said. However, he said snow that fell Friday during the day in 
downtown Chicago was lake-effect snow not related to the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	With gusts expected in the 45 mph range, officials in Chicago  
were preparing by placing walls of sandbags along Lakeshore Drive 
to prevent waves from Lake Michigan from flooding the oft-used 
thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow plows also were attached to the front of scores of city  
trucks normally used to haul garbage. And, with more than 100 
pieces of snow removal equipment in place at O'Hare and Midway 
airports, officials there said they also had hundreds of cots on 
standby for travelers who may be stranded by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we have our crews in place, additional staff has  
been called in and is ready to go,'' Monique Bond, a spokeswoman 
for the Chicago Department of Aviation, said Friday. ``We're ready 
to go -- just waiting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luckily, she said, the bulk of holiday travelers aren't expected  
to fly until Sunday or Monday, after the storm is supposed to pass 
through.

<HEADLINE> Midwest Braces for Big Snow Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Midwesterners headed to supermarkets and  
hardware stores Friday to snap up last-minute supplies as the 
region prepared for a storm that was expected to drop more than a 
foot of snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't advise travel at all ... especially with the strong  
winds,'' said Robin Smith, a meteorologist the National Weather 
Service in Joliet, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Several inches of snow had already fallen in parts of the  
Plains. In Missouri, the new year brought a combination of snow, 
sleet, ice and freezing that made things a mess for holiday 
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said the northern parts of Illinois and Indiana  
could get up to 14 inches of snow by Saturday night. Gusty winds 
could create near-blizzard conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	In Evansville, Ind., where the snow arrived first as the storm  
rolled up the Ohio River Valley, customers flocked to Buehler's 
Buy-Low to stock up on milk, bread, eggs and meat. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant manager Jeff Quirk said that, normally, the New Year's  
Day holiday is one of the store's slowest days of the year. But the 
throngs prompted him to bring in extra workers to help out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to call in everybody we could,'' Quirk said as he  
took a break from checkout lines where he had spent most of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines officials said passengers planning to fly from  
O'Hare this weekend should try to leave Friday or wait until Monday 
or Tuesday. More than 100 pieces of snow removal equipment in place 
at O'Hare and Midway airports, and hundreds of cots were on standby 
for travelers who may be stranded by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Several inches of snow had already fallen in the Plains by  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two people were killed in a weather-related accident  
Friday on Interstate 80 in Nebraska as freezing drizzle and up to 3 
inches of snow combined to make roads extremely slick. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Arkansas, more than 30,000 customers were without power  
early Friday following an ice storm.

<HEADLINE> Government Collects From Deadbeats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government efforts to force deadbeat parents  
to pay their delinquent child support appears to be working. 
Figures released Thursday by the Department of Health and Human 
Services show a significant increase in collection of overdue 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	The total number of delinquent child support payments that the  
government collected rose seven percent this year to a record $14.4 
billion, an increase of 80 percent over the past six years. The 
number is a compilation of both federal and state efforts 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal seizures of income tax refunds contributed greatly to  
the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of deadbeat parents across the nation opened their tax  
refund envelopes only to find that the money they were expecting 
was used to pay their delinquent child support, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS seized $1.1 billion in tax refunds from parents who were  
delinquent in their child support payments. More than a million 
American families in all 50 states received money owed to them by 
delinquent parents through the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, state governments report the names of parents  
who owe child support payments to HHS, which then notifies the 
delinquent parents of the impending tax refund seizure. If the 
parents do not pay their debt, the amount is deducted from their 
refund. HHS can also report the failure to pay to credit agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also announced that next year's budget proposal  
will include funding to find and prosecute violators under new, 
strict laws that make moving across state lines to avoid paying 
child support a federal offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Coordinating collection and prosecution efforts between state  
and federal agencies has been very successful -- increasing the 
number of federal convictions 18-fold since the program's inception 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, currently in five states, would be expanded to 17  
more states. The White House budget proposal asks for $34 million 
from Congress to support legal staff in U.S. Attorneys' offices to 
deal specifically with deadbeat parents. Another $12 million will 
be reappropriated by HHS to hire and train investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	A state-by-state breakdown of the $14.4 billion in collections  
will be released later in the winter.

<HEADLINE> Freeze Hurts Calif. Orange Pickers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORANGE COVE, Calif. (AP) -- It took Jose Rosas 10 years of  
picking oranges to bring his family to the United States. Together, 
they worked their way from a miserable apartment where they slept 
on the floor to a big stucco ranch house with cathedral ceilings 
and a back yard. 
</P>
<P>
	But now a four-day freeze that struck shortly before Christmas  
here in California's Central Valley has ruined much of the citrus 
crop and closed down most packing houses. Jose and Alicia Rosas 
have been laid off along with thousands of other workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to lose our home. I don't want to move out,''  
said Mrs. Rosas, who is studying English at home in hopes of 
becoming an U.S. citizen. ``This place is a palace compared to the 
way we used to live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The economic disaster, now estimated at $591 million statewide,  
is particularly severe in towns along the Sierra foothills such as 
Orange Cove, a virtual labor camp for the citrus industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Private groups and public agencies are marshaling resources,  
hoping to avoid the trauma of the freeze of 1990, when it took 
three months for the government to take notice and 12,000 people 
lost their jobs. Most people haven't fully recovered, city 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, many citrus workers were migrants, and could find work  
elsewhere. Now, only a quarter of the pickers are. Most of the rest 
have apartment leases, mortgages, green cards -- roots. The crisis 
threatens more than just monthly expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Orange Cove estimate that 90 percent of the  
population depends directly on California's orange industry, which 
produces 80 percent of the nation's fresh table oranges. 
</P>
<P>
	With two long harvest seasons for oranges -- valencias in the  
summer, navels in the winter -- those who can find work can earn a 
relatively good living. Packers usually make minimum wage, while 
the going rate for pickers is about $12 a bin. A good week in the 
field can bring in $300 to $400. 
</P>
<P>
	But unexpected weather like December's cold snap can be  
devastating, especially in the San Joaquin Valley, where 90 percent 
of navel oranges are grown and 65 packing houses employ up to 
15,000 pickers and packers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's who gets killed in this whole thing, the pickers and  
the packers,'' said Nick Hill, whose family has been growing 
oranges for three generations. ``We like to keep these people 
working. It's not a good thing all around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orange Cove is a mostly Hispanic community of 8,000 nestled at  
the foot of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. There's no high school and 
no drug store, just acre after acre of orange trees, many in 
orchards owned by corporations or absentee landlords. 
</P>
<P>
	Most residents do not speak English, and make little more than  
the average annual income of $4,300 reported in the 1990 Census. 
Nearly half the town is on welfare. The unemployment rate ranges up 
to 75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the freeze, hundreds of workers have been streaming into a  
makeshift social service center for emergency food stamps and other 
temporary relief. Some are turned away for lack of green cards. 
Others wait for hours, sometimes days, to fill out paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanya Lucatero, who ferried family members to the center for  
three straight days, sat patiently with her 8-month-old daughter. 
At 19 and with another child on the way, she was seeking emergency 
food stamps to supplement her unemployment benefits of about $400 a 
month. Rent for the apartment they just moved into is $250, and 
there's little extra money to pay for food, diapers and other 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told my husband today would be his last day,'' she said.  
``We're going to be living on the line for everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Rosas got public assistance to survive in 1990, but that  
was before his family joined him from Mexico. And now there are 
in-laws and grandchildren, two cars in the garage, a computer for 
the kids and two daughters in college, training to be teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want my kids to get an education so they don't have to  
suffer like this,'' Rosas said. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, there is no money coming in. Son Daniel has been out of  
a job for nearly a month. He and his wife brought home their last 
paychecks last week -- his was $200, hers was $61. 
</P>
<P>
	And there were no wise men in the Nativity scene in the corner  
of the living room this Christmas because the Rosas couldn't afford 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never had bad credit. I've always paid my bills,'' Rosas  
said in Spanish. ``We have to be patient and hope that people will 
be understanding and wait, because I don't know whether we can pay 
on time.''

<HEADLINE> Petr Korda Puts Off Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Australian Open champion Petr Korda had planned to  
retire at the end of 1998 but changed his mind because he wants to 
clear his name after failing a drug test. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 30-year-old Czech fears he will have a ``black mark'' on  
his name for the rest of his life because people won't believe his 
claim that he wasn't aware that he took a steroid. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone during  
Wimbledon last July, the International Tennis Federation disclosed 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda lost 199 rankings points and $94,529 prize money he earned  
at Wimbledon. But, in a highly controversial decision, the ITF 
decided not to suspend Korda, accepting his contention that he 
didn't know how the drug found its way into his system. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda is entered in next week's Qatar Open as he prepares to  
defend his Australian title at Melbourne this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to play the (1998) season and then retire, but I  
couldn't retire in such circumstances,'' he told The Times of 
London in an interview published Friday. ``I now just want one or 
two more years to show people what Petr Korda is capable of on the 
tennis court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korda continued to proclaim his innocence.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have never cheated and I have never taken any steroid to  
increase my performance on the court,'' he said. ``When I first 
heard the news, I thought it was a bad joke, and it became a very 
difficult time for me and my family. 
</P>
<P>
	``But now I am very happy with the decision of the (ITF)  
committee, which has shown that I am innocent because I didn't 
knowingly take anything to raise my performance. I am 100 percent 
natural and not into anabolic steroids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korda remains baffled how the drug turned up in his urine sample  
when he was tested after his quarterfinal loss to Tim Henman. 
</P>
<P>
	But, significantly, he admitted that he had taken injections for  
a foot injury that week. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I have an injection, I always ask what is in it, but  
sometimes you just have to trust the person who administers it,'' 
Korda said. ``If I had any knowledge about how I came into contact 
with the steroid, then I could set out to clear my name. 
</P>
<P>
	``But now I suppose I will always have a black mark ... and  
never be able to clean it off. I know that not many people believe 
me, but I have to defend myself ...''

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Sledgehammer-wielding robbers who stole expensive  
watches from an Atlanta store appear to be the same men who hit two 
North Carolina stores earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys have already stolen over $1 million in jewelry in a  
two-day period,'' said Atlanta Detective Ed Christian. He said they 
seem to be after watches worth $30,000 to $40,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The masked robbers' use stolen vehicles that are later dumped  
near the crime scene, and always leave behind a small sledgehammer, 
Christian said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday morning, the two thieves entered the precious jewelry  
section of the Neiman Marcus store at Atlanta's Lenox Square mall. 
One headed toward a display case filled with expensive watches, 
while the other approached employees and whipped out a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	When some employees dropped to the floor, the other robber  
smashed the case and stuffed as many watches as he could into a 
bucket. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe the same two stole Tuesday from jewelry stores in  
Raleigh and Pineville, N.C., grabbing diamond rings and Rolex 
watches. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas-based Neiman Marcus is offering a $10,000 reward for  
information on the robberies, spokeswoman Amy Doelling said.

<HEADLINE> Bal d'Argent Wins at Calder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Bal d'Argent, a 17-1 shot, opened a long lead in  
midstretch, then held off heavily favored Seducer by 1 1/4 lengths to 
win the $100,000 Tropical Park Oaks on the turf Friday at Calder 
Race Course. 
</P>
<P>
	Wild Heart Dancing was third in a field of 12 fillies that  
became 3-year-olds on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a remarkable 48-length turnaround for Bal d'Argent. She  
finished last, beaten by 47 lengths, as Seducer decisively won the 
$100,000 Hollywood Wildcat Stakes at Calder Nov. 22. Bal d'Argent 
was blocked badly on the far turn of that grass race. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Pedro Rodriguez for the eighth straight time, Bal  
d'Argent won the Oaks in 1:42 4-5 for 1 1-16 miles. She paid $36, 
$9 and $6. Seducer, who was odds-on, paid $3 and $2.60. Wild Heart 
Dancing paid $3.80 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two finishers carried high weight of 118 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
	Bal d'Argent was third much of the way, behind Eyes For Love and  
Shebeaflyer. Bal d'Argent moved between them on the far turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Bal d'Argent moved ahead at the five-sixteenths pole. She was  
clear by three lengths at the top of the stretch as Seducer started 
her move on the outside. Her run was not too little, but it was too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner is a New Jersey-bred daughter of Silver Buck, owned  
by Celia and Elbert Dixon. She won four of nine starts as a 
2-year-old, closing out the year with a 6 1/2-length victory in the 
$100,000 Boca Raton Stakes on the dirt. She has earned $176,730.

<HEADLINE> NYSE Announces New Safeguard Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Stock Exchange announced slightly  
revised levels for its so-called ``circuit breakers'' Thursday, 
recalculating how steeply stocks would have to tumble in order to 
stop trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The new circuit breaker system, which was approved by federal  
regulators in April, suspends trading for declines in the Dow Jones 
industrial average of 10 percent, 20 percent and 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The percentage declines remain the same. But in order to account  
for changes in the Dow's level, the NYSE recalculates the number of 
points it takes to reach those thresholds every three months. The 
figures are rounded to the nearest 50 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange kept the first circuit breaker the same, calling  
for a one-hour halt in trading if the Dow falls 900 points, but it 
raised the two higher triggers by 50 points each. 
</P>
<P>
	It will now take a drop of 1,800 points to shut the market for  
two hours, and 2,700 points to shut it for the rest of the day. The 
shutdowns vary in length for the first two triggers if they are 
reached late in the trading day. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the limits were extended, trading was suspended for a  
half-hour if the Dow dropped 350 points and for one hour if the 
index fell 550 points. Under the old rules, the market would close 
for the day if the 350 level was reached at 3:30 p.m. or if the 550 
level was hit at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The only time circuit breakers ever halted trading on the NYSE  
was on Oct. 27, 1997, when it happened twice. Trading was stopped 
for 30 minutes when the Dow had plunged 350 points by 2:35 p.m. 
Twenty-five minutes after trading resumed, the Dow had plummeted an 
additional 200 points and trading was ended for the day with the 
Dow down 554.26, or by 7.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading halts were enacted after the Oct. 19, 1987 Black Monday  
crash, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 508 points, or 22 
percent -- the only time it has declined more than 20 percent. There 
were only two other times that the Dow has dropped by more than 10 
percent, both during the 1929 crash. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Dow now more than five times as high as it was after  
the 1987 crash, the old point thresholds were viewed as outdated 
and critics claimed they caused panic selling by investors who were 
trying to avoid being locked out by a shutdown.

<HEADLINE> Chocolates, Cookies Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two kinds of chocolates and a brand of butter  
cookies are being recalled because they may pose the risk of a life 
threatening reaction if eaten by someone allergic to nuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Elite Confections USA recalled two versions of the company's  
milk chocolate coins, particularly popular for Hanukkah, because 
they may contain undeclared peanut residues. 
</P>
<P>
	People who are allergic to peanuts run the risk of a serious,  
even life threatening, reaction if they consume the product. The 
Food and Drug Administration has received reports of two New Jersey 
children who are allergic to peanuts suffering a reaction after 
eating the chocolate coins. 
</P>
<P>
	There are two types of recalled chocolate coins: One is sold in  
boxes containing 24 yellow mesh bags that each contains five coins 
wrapped in gold foil and secured with red tags labeled ``Elite milk 
chocolate coins.'' They also bear the UPC number 77245-10184. 
</P>
<P>
	The other type is ``Presidents Gold Coins,'' sold in plastic  
containers that contain 48 mesh bags, each bag containing one large 
coin and four smaller coins. The bags are secured with a dark blue 
tag labeled ``Elite milk chocolate coins,'' and bear the UPC number 
77245-10617. 
</P>
<P>
	The coins were believed to have been manufactured and sold  
between April and November. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers are urged to return the chocolate coins to the place  
of purchase for a full refund, or call Elite at 718-402-7800. 
</P>
<P>
	Also recalled this week: Allegro butter cookies filled with  
eclair, because the English-language ingredient list on the 
imported boxes does not list hazelnuts. 
</P>
<P>
	People allergic to hazelnuts run the risk of a serious or life  
threatening reaction if they consume the product. 
</P>
<P>
	The cookies, imported by Dangold Inc. of New York, are 7-ounce  
boxes sold before November. They bear the UPC number 0927 1936 
1831. While Dangold believes none are left on store shelves, the 
cookies have no expiration date and thus the FDA wants to alert 
consumers who may have remaining cookies in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers may return recalled cookies to the place of purchase  
for a refund, or call Dangold at 718-591-5286.

<HEADLINE> Woman Killed by Cops Shot 12 Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- Relatives of a teen-ager shot 12 times  
by police as she sat locked in a car with a gun demanded a federal 
investigation after a coroner's report showed she had died of two 
head wounds and a shot to her chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The family is hurt and terribly upset about what happened,''  
said Dwayne Miller, an uncle of shooting victim Tyisha Miller. ``We 
don't just want facts in two weeks. We want answers now. Why would 
they shoot that many times?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of Ms. Miller, who was black, say she was unconscious  
when officers opened fire early Monday. Authorities had responded 
to a call that a woman was locked in a car at a gas station, 
unresponsive as relatives banged on the window. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers said they opened fire when Ms. Miller grabbed her gun.  
Initially, investigators said Ms. Miller fired at officers, but 
they later said they didn't know who fired first. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers involved in the shooting -- three white and one  
Hispanic -- have been placed on administrative leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Miller was shot four times in the head, once in the chest  
and had seven other bullet wounds, according to the preliminary 
autopsy report released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the report was released, more than 150 people gathered at  
a meeting organized by black leaders to ask police about the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a wakeup call for all of us. We all need to  
participate as a community and make sure it's handled properly,'' 
resident Donald Juniel said outside the meeting at Cesar Chavez 
Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. James Cannon said police would support federal oversight  
during the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only do we have to protect the rights of Tyisha Miller,  
but also the rights of the employees of Riverside,'' Cannon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Riverside is 60 miles east of Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE>  Euro Boosts Unity and Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- For 11 European nations, the New Year  
ushered in the era of the euro, a single currency that promises to 
link the continent's economic fortunes and bolster hopes for 
political unity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Welcome to Euro-Land!'' the Austrian newspaper Neue Kronen  
Zeitung proclaimed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance ministers from the euro nations popped champagne corks  
shaped in the euro's ``e'' symbol Thursday, setting off a frantic 
weekend for financial workers who are adapting computer systems and 
converting stocks, bonds and bank accounts into euros. 
</P>
<P>
	At the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve in Brussels, after  
years of preparation, the euro became the common currency of 
Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, 
Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout Europe, the event was hailed as a historic turning  
point, creating a powerful new force in the world economy and 
fulfilling the postwar dreams of union among nations whose 
divisions dragged the planet into its bloodiest wars twice this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the postwar era ended nine years ago with the fall of the  
Berlin Wall, then our future begins on Jan. 1, 1999,'' German 
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder wrote in the Handelsblatt business 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading in the euro began today in India, with buyers paying a  
premium for euros in two trades with ABN-AMRO Bank, said Ravi 
Kumar, chief dealer at the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	A government-owned Indian bank bought 5 million euros and a  
corporate customer bought 100,000 euros at slightly more than 
$1.17, higher than the rate the European Commission set Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The euro is showing a tendency to appreciate, since the rate  
for the euro is up from yesterday,'' said G. Padmanabham, chief 
dealer at the State Bank of India, which also began trading euros 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain is staying out of the euro for now, but the Labor  
government hopes to convince voters to join as soon as the next 
decade. Denmark and Greece also hope to join within the next few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The new currency is worth 1.95583 German marks, 6.55957 French  
francs, 1936.27 Italian lire, 166.386 Spanish pesetas. When most 
markets open after the long holiday weekend, the euro is expected 
to start trading at 133 Japanese yen and 70 British pence. 
</P>
<P>
	Although euro notes and coins won't be issued to replace Irish  
pounds, Portuguese escudos, Austrian schillings and the rest until 
2002, the new currency will immediately come into use for non-cash 
transactions ranging from government bond issues to credit card and 
check purchases. Euro figures will also appear alongside national 
currencies on paychecks, phone bills and bank statements. 
</P>
<P>
	France printed its first postage stamp denominated in euros on  
Thursday. The new stamp is worth 3 francs, or .46 euros. 
</P>
<P>
	From Thursday, francs, marks and the rest will no longer be  
traded in foreign exchange markets. Equities and bonds will be 
quoted in euros. Bank transfers and business deals will 
increasingly be in the new money. 
</P>
<P>
	Participating nations say that will help business by creating a  
seamless market of 292 million citizens where companies can operate 
without exchange costs or currency jitters. 
</P>
<P>
	Representing 20 percent of world economic output and 18 percent  
of world trade, the euro-zone will be a powerful player in the 
world economy. For the first time in decades, the U.S. dollar will 
have a rival as the currency of choice for world trade and 
government reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The euro becomes the strong arm of the strongest economic  
region of the world,'' said Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima. 
</P>
<P>
	Euroland governments stressed the currency was about more than  
just economics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Europe is finishing the century by sending a message of  
peace,'' said Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Ciampi. ``The 
conflicts that have so often gripped our continent are a thing of 
the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest EU polls published in September showed that 66  
percent of citizens in the euro-zone support the common currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good moment, the future is with the euro,'' teacher  
Blandine Barnier said in the French city of Lyon. ``The children 
are really aware of the euro, they travel a lot around Europe and 
know what it's about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ministers stressed that the currency union needed to be backed  
up quickly with progress to increase European cooperation in fields 
such as foreign affairs and defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Such talk will fuel euro-skeptical opinions in countries that  
have stayed out of the monetary union because of fears of losing 
national independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Britain must stay clear of this great fiasco,'' said Teddy  
Taylor, a lawmaker with Britain's opposition Conservative Party.

<HEADLINE> Castro Hails Cuba's Last 40 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTIAGO, Cuba (AP) -- Fidel Castro headed New Year's Day to the  
spot where he first appeared as Cuba's leader 40 years ago -- 
Santiago's colonial-style city hall on the Plaza de Cespedes. 
</P>
<P>
	Banners celebrating the anniversary were strung over the narrow  
streets leading to the small plaza; chairs were set out in careful 
lines and a television truck was parked nearby to broadcast the 
event live. 
</P>
<P>
	It was far more orderly than the joyous confusion that night on  
Jan. 1, 1959, when the rebel leader arrived in the eastern Cuban 
city where he had spent much of his youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Dictator Fulgencio Batista had fled Cuba early in the morning.  
But Castro devoted much of his 1959 speech to warnings against a 
military takeover he worried would try to cheat his rebel forces of 
triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	That threat quickly collapsed and Castro began a triumphant  
week-long journey across a Cuba that celebrated him for toppling 
the thuggish and corrupt Batista regime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not interested in power nor do I envisage assuming it at  
any time,'' Castro told the crowd here in 1959. ``All that I will 
do is to make sure that the sacrifices of so many compatriots 
should not be in vain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He promised to ``exile hatred from the republic'' and promised  
that ``there will be freedom for those who speak in our favor and 
for those who speak against us and criticize us. ... We shall never 
feel offended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forty years later, Castro remains firmly in power. And while  
Cuba these days allows a measure of private dissent, there is 
little room for those who try to organize formal opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro is admired in many parts of the world for his prickly  
proud independence after nearly four centuries of Spanish colonial 
rule and decades of heavy U.S. influence, followed by 38 years of 
U.S. economic embargo. Once dismissed by critics as a Soviet 
satellite, Cuba has outlasted the Soviet Union by eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a nation that has almost wiped out illiteracy and has  
created a surplus of physicians. It is a world power in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet it struggles to put bread and beans on people's table and  
its growing reliance on tourist dollars has created social 
frictions. For many, a month's wage in pesos is about $10. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy has slowly edged up from the economic collapse that  
followed the Soviet bloc's fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Adolfo Perez, 58, left a tobacco shop with a handful of cigars.  
A veteran of the revolution against Batista, he recalled the day of 
triumph as ``striking joy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were, we are and we will be with the revolution,'' he said,  
calling economic woes ``a problem of the moment.'' Everyone in Cuba 
has enough to eat, he said, though he admitted, ``What they cannot 
do in this moment is choose what they eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Isaac Gruclajel, a 60-year-old driver for a hospital, also  
was proud of his service with Castro's rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my revolution!'' he said, slapping his chest with a  
weathered hand. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the economy had been better in 1958.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even have a house,'' he said. ``I sleep in my truck at  
the hospital.''

<HEADLINE>  750,000 Watch Rose Bowl Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The 110th Tournament of Roses closed out  
the 20th century with the roar of a squadron of Navy fighter jets 
buzzing over the floral New Year's Day spectacle that looked back 
in tribute to astronauts, sports heroes, family life and ``Sesame 
Street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing! Ten times better in person,'' said ``7th  
Heaven'' TV actress Beverley Mitchell as she got a close view of 56 
``Echoes of the Century''-themed floats covered with flowers, 
leaves, grass, seeds and spices. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer buffs could catch the parade on the Internet thanks to  
float cams and a laptop-equipped parade staff who recounted details 
electronically from atop a float while an estimated half-billion 
people worldwide watched the spectacle on television and curbside. 
</P>
<P>
	In this parade, the U.S. Postal Service couldn't deliver.  
</P>
<P>
	When its trophy-winning ``Classic Movie Monsters'' float  
depicting Frankenstein and carrying real-life mistress of the night 
Elvira rounded a corner its motor conked out and the driver reached 
his hand out of the crypt where he was sitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need a tow!'' the driver shouted. A tow truck was hitched up  
within one minute and the float unceremoniously continued down the 
boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of New Year's celebrants staked out prime spots along  
a 5 1/2-mile route some 24 hours before Friday's parade start. An 
estimated 750,000 watched in person. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was another picture-perfect weather day in Southern  
California: Sunshine splashing the parade route, framed by the 
towering San Gabriel Mountains, was televised to an estimated 450 
million people in 102 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The grandstands were jammed, many of them Wisconsin fans in town  
for the Rose Bowl game between UCLA and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a festive crowd. Southern Californians moaned about  
41-degree chill at dawn, but it was balmy for Wisconsin visitors. 
It was 8 below zero in Green Bay, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to go back,'' said Brooke Torhorst, a recent  
graduate of the University of Wisconsin who stood along the parade 
route wearing shorts, a sweatshirt and sandals. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 95 arrests, mostly minor violations such as public  
drunkenness, fighting and vehicle code violations, police 
spokeswoman Janet Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
	The parade combined high tech with whimsy as well as memorable  
symbols of the 20th century. There also were 22 marching bands, 25 
equestrian units and celebrity grand marshals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my third time. I'm going to try to get it right this  
time,'' Shirley Temple Black, the former child star and U.S. 
ambassador, said jokingly. She shared grand marshal honors with 
astronaut Buzz Aldrin, film producer David Wolper and the late 
baseball legend Jackie Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a sobering entry from the Simon Wiesenthal Center's  
Museum of Tolerance. ``Jerusalem, City of Peace'' honored the holy 
city's three religious traditions of Judaism, Islam and 
Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest crowd pleasers included Humor Trophy winner  
``Friends for Life,'' depicting ``Sesame Street'' characters Big 
Bird, the Cookie Monster and Bert &AMP; Ernie, and Sweepstakes Trophy 
winner ``Friends of the Rain Forest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The President's Trophy was awarded to ``Mother's Day,'' the  
Florists' Transworld Delivery entry featuring famous TV moms 
Shirley Jones (``Partridge Family''), Marion Ross (``Happy Days'') 
and Cynthia Harris (``Mad About You''). It included raccoons made 
of cornsilk, uva grass bunnies and yellow chrysanthemum ducks 
perched around a gigantic fallen log. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothy Letterman, mother of TV talk show host David Letterman,  
was aboard Kiwanis International's ``Children of the World'' float, 
which won the Isabella Coleman Trophy for presentation of color and 
color harmony through use of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Website,'' the 10-ton City of Los Angeles entry featuring a  
large spider building a web with computers, was the parade's first 
high-tech float, boasting riders chatting on laptops with a live 
Internet audience.

<HEADLINE> AirTouch Takeover Reportedly Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bell Atlantic Corp., already in the midst of a  
huge merger with GTE Corp., reportedly is near a $45 billion 
takeover of AirTouch Communications Inc., the nation's 
second-largest cellular phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable business news channel CNBC, citing sources close to  
the talks, said Thursday that a deal could be announced as early as 
next week. Bell Atlantic spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to 
comment and an AirTouch spokesman did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	At current stock prices, the reported purchase price would make  
Bell Atlantic-AirTouch the fifth-largest merger in history. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco-based AirTouch, a spinoff of former Baby Bell  
Pacific Telesis Group, ranks behind only AT&AMP;T Corp. among U.S. 
cellular phone companies. The company has 14 million cellular 
subscribers in the United States, as well as fast-growing 
international operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly merged MCI WorldCom Inc. and Vodafone Group PLC, Britain's  
leading wireless company, had previously been rumored as potential 
suitors for AirTouch, which has said it would be open to merger 
proposals, CNBC reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic this summer agreed to merge with GTE in a $64  
billion deal that would allow the companies to create a huge 
provider of all-in-one services, including long distance, local 
calling and wireless services.

<HEADLINE> Financial Resolutions for 1999 / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The start of a year is a logical time to set  
financial goals, be it cutting back on unnecessary spending, saving 
more for the future or improving the performance of an investment 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	Some households will need major changes, others need only  
fine-tune existing financial plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the circumstance, most people are heading into the  
final months of the millennium in a positive mindset. 
</P>
<P>
	One recent poll by Lutheran Brotherhood, a financial services  
company in Minneapolis, found 52 percent of Americans think they'll 
be better off in 1999; only 20 percent feel they'll be worse off. 
Nearly half predict incomes will rise, while 62 percent believe the 
economy will remain stable or improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even with the recent volatility in the stock market, many  
people are expecting 1999 to be a prosperous year,'' notes Les 
Bendtsen, Lutheran Brotherhood's manager of investment relations. 
</P>
<P>
	To make that a reality, financial experts are once again  
offering a magnitude of advice for the new year. Much has been said 
before, though for most people, it's worth repeating since it 
involves breaking stubborn habits of years past. 
</P>
<P>
	A few financial resolutions for 1999:  
</P>
<P>
	--Save more.  
</P>
<P>
	1998 was a dismal year. Americans set aside less than 1 percent  
of disposable income during the first three quarters, and the 
national savings rate actually dipped into negative territory in 
September and October. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount that should be set aside depends on age, income and  
debt load. 
</P>
<P>
	Some financial advisers think the average household should save  
around 10 percent of gross income. Others like to see at minimum 
three months' salary placed in a cash reserve for emergency 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	--Contribute to retirement.  
</P>
<P>
	If you're not participating in an employer-sponsored savings  
plan, like a 401(k), start now, or increase the contributions. The 
advantages: taxes are lowered and a tidy nest egg is built. 
</P>
<P>
	Remember, 401(k) contributions come from pretax dollars, and  
earnings on them are tax deferred. Often times, employers match 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	If no plan is offered, or even if one is, consider an Individual  
Retirement Account as well. For certain people, contributions are 
tax deductible, but even if they're not, there are many advantages 
to having one. Roth IRA contributors, for instance, may qualify for 
tax- and penalty-free withdrawals long before they retire. 
</P>
<P>
	--Review your investment portfolio.  
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street's volatility left some people rethinking their  
strategies. But experts stress that investing requires patience and 
discipline, and most individuals should be in it for the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
	You may need to shift out of certain investments periodically.  
You can't, for example, leave money in consistently underperforming 
stocks or funds and forget about it. Rules of thumb: diversify, 
allocate assets according to risk level. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cut expenses.  
</P>
<P>
	The best way to save and invest more is to spend less.  
</P>
<P>
	A budget is crucial. While preparing one, seek input from family  
members on ways to cut costs, then use one of the several good 
financial software programs now available to crunch the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	There are countless ways to cut back; some can be innovative.  
</P>
<P>
	``Brewing your morning coffee at home instead of buying it on  
the way to work could easily save $300 a year. Making a few phone 
calls to price shop for car insurance could net you another $400 
...,'' says Mark Eisenson, coauthor of ``Invest in Yourself: Six 
Secrets to a Rich Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Lower debt.  
</P>
<P>
	Americans are $6 trillion in the hole from credit cards,  
mortgages and other loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Take advantage of low interest rates to refinance your mortgage  
and trim monthly housing payments. Pay off credit card balances. 
</P>
<P>
	The longer card payments drag on, the higher the debt becomes. A  
$1,200 tab charged at 17 percent interest takes nearly 20 years to 
pay off and costs around $2,000 in interest if only minimum 
payments are made. 
</P>
<P>
	If you're having trouble paying bills, get help. The Consumer  
Credit Counseling Services in Silver Spring, Md., has offices 
nationwide and charges only a nominal fee for its services. 
</P>
<P>
	--Do estate planning.  
</P>
<P>
	If you haven't drawn up a will or a trust, do so now.  
</P>
<P>
	A good estate planner can set one up and discuss important  
issues like dividing property, designating beneficiaries or powers 
of attorney, with an eye toward taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Get organized.  
</P>
<P>
	Gather important financial and legal documents. Some papers,  
like old bank statements or check stubs, can be tossed; others, 
like insurance policies or tax returns, can't. 
</P>
<P>
	Develop a system for monitoring savings, investments and bill  
paying. Here too some of the current financial software can help. 
</P>
<P>
	Citibank offers a free workbook, ``Getting Financially Organized  
-- Money Minder Worksheets,'' to those calling (800) 669-2635. 
</P>
<P>
	--Understand personal finance.  
</P>
<P>
	There's plenty of information available through books,  
magazines, newspapers, newsletters and on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	They offer investment and tax advice, keep you abreast of  
legislative changes and keep track of important dates during this 
new year.

<HEADLINE> New Laws Set To Make Debut in '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Happy New Year, Hollywood! If you're a celebrity, 1999 means you  
can now slap those pesky paparazzi with invasion of privacy 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the nation, the new year brings thousands of new rules  
and regulations governing everything from drunken teen-age drivers 
to the folks who haul kitchen grease. 
</P>
<P>
	The laws range from the sweeping -- a complete rewrite of  
Delaware's tax code -- to the extremely specific, such as a Florida 
measure that requires pet ferrets that bit someone to be 
quarantined and tested for rabies instead of being automatically 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the new laws of 1999 are aimed at young people.  
</P>
<P>
	Children with asthma in Wisconsin can now carry inhalers to  
school. Parents whose children are killed can sue for loss of 
companionship in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to crack down on minors who steal cigarettes, Idaho  
requires that tobacco products be kept in locked displays or behind 
counters. Indiana, Minnesota and Nebraska create more restrictions 
on young drivers. New Hampshire makes it easier to try juveniles as 
adults if they're charged with negligent homicide for driving 
drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	New laws raise penalties for people who harm children, such as  
adults who buy liquor for teens in California or those in New 
Hampshire who use child pornography, molest children or make them 
fake IDs. 
</P>
<P>
	Also bringing harsher penalties in 1999:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Evading a police officer in your car in California, or chasing  
another driver who ultimately gets seriously hurt or killed. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Driving drunk in Washington state -- an automatic license  
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Assaulting a pregnant woman and harming her fetus in Michigan.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Harming a police dog or horse in New Hampshire.  
</P>
<P>
	Supervising or recruiting prostitutes will now be illegal in  
California, as will having body armor if you've been convicted of a 
violent felony. Felons in Utah prisons will not be allowed to vote 
in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	You won't have to be a criminal to feel the grip of government  
under other new laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, couples who don't agree to four hours of  
marriage-preparation counseling will have to wait three days to tie 
the knot and pay $88.50 for a marriage license instead of $56. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in California, the Highway Patrol will be allowed to stop  
truckers who haul kitchen grease to make sure they really own the 
goop. Apparently there's a market for the stuff and it gets stolen 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
	The new year puts a little more money in some people's pockets  
in New Mexico, where a sales tax on prescription drugs will expire, 
as will property taxes on business computers in Wisconsin. That law 
is worth an estimated $64 million a year. Car taxes are going down 
in California, and the minimum wage is going up in Oregon and 
Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	California repealed a slew of outdated laws, including a World  
War II measure making it a crime to buy, sell or forge ration 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
	It ``will eliminate excess verbiage to offset all the excess  
verbiage the Legislature adds each year,'' state Sen. Quentin Kopp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts residents will certainly know something's changed  
in 1999, when ``Say Hello to Someone in Massachusetts'' becomes the 
official state polka, which goes, in part: 
</P>
<P>
	``Tip your hat to every lady that you meet,  
</P>
<P>
	Shake a hand, you'll make a friend in Massachusetts,  
</P>
<P>
	That New England old time custom can't be beat.''

</P>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Peter Alenov Jr., who sold guitars to  
Keith Richards, Eric Clapton and other rock stars, died Wednesday 
in a car accident. He was 45. 
</P>
<P>
	Alenov, owner of Pete's Guitar, started a guitar-repair store in  
1969 but later changed his store to a by-appointment-only 
dealership. He catered to a virtual Who's Who of rock -- the Rolling 
Stones, Aerosmith, Kiss, the Scorpions and AC/DC. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for his guitars generally ranged from $500 to $5,000.  
Paul McCartney once paid $10,000 for a left-handed 1959 Les Paul 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, another former Beatle, George Harrison, stopped by  
Pete's Guitar to buy a ukulele, a Fender Telecaster guitar and an 
amplifier.

                         *George Lynn Cross    	
</P>
<P>
	NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- George Lynn Cross, who guided the  
University of Oklahoma as its president from 1944 to 1968, died 
Thursday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross, the university's longest-serving president, initiated a  
construction project during his tenure in which 37 buildings were 
either constructed or expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his greatest challenges came when a black woman, Ada Lois  
Sipuel, applied to the university's law school in 1946. State 
officials ordered Cross to refuse admittance to all blacks and he 
complied, but he said Miss Sipuel was qualified to enter the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Sipuel, represented by attorney Thurgood Marshall, battled  
with the Oklahoma Attorney General's office for three years, during 
which time a black man, G.W. McLaurin, was admitted to OU's 
graduate program in education. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross later wrote ``Blacks in White Colleges: Oklahoma's  
Landmark Cases.'' In 1952, he received a citation from the American 
Conference of Christians and Jews for promoting religious and 
racial understanding.

for supporting roles in dozens of films, died Wednesday. He was 75.

comic strip character Barbarella and designed sets for the '60s 
cult movie that starred Jane Fonda, died Wednesday of a respiratory 
illness. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barbarella'' went on to inspire fashion designers, a string of  
comic strip heroines and the '80s pop group Duran Duran, who chose 
their name from a character in the film. 
</P>
<P>
	Forest created the seductive 41st-century adventuress in April  
1962, and the character first appeared that year in ``V Magazine.'' 
The series, published in other languages, was censored in France 
and was barred from advertising or sale to minors until the early 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Forest was honored in 1984 with the Grand Prize of Angouleme,

</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hearst married and divorced newspaper executive Randolph  
Apperson Hearst, the son of William Randolph Hearst, who later 
became president of The San Francisco Examiner and Chairman of the 
Hearst Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	She served 20 years on the University of California Board of  
Regents during the 1960s and '70s when California's universities 
were rocked by the free speech and anti-war movements. 
</P>
<P>
	The turmoil of the era became a family matter Feb. 4, 1974, when  
a revolutionary group called the Symbionese Liberation Army 
kidnapped her daughter Patty. Patty Hearst went on to join her 
abductors in a bank robbery that led to a seven-year prison 
sentence.

</P>
<P>
	He began work as a serviceman for an Omaha store fixtures  
company. When the company dropped the service work, Lozier and a 
friend formed a company in 1937 to handle the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Lozier and his wife, Emma, operated the business in the garage

<P>
	The Drifters were formed in 1953 and still toured, but there  
have been a number of changes in the group's personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore joined in 1954. He and the entire group were fired four  
years later in a dispute with the group's manager. 
</P>
<P>
	A completely new group was formed and Moore was rehired in 1961  
after a stint of military service. He joined lead singer Rudy Lewis 
on such hits as ``Up on The Roof'' and ``On Broadway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Lewis died in 1964, Moore became lead singer with ``Under  
the Boardwalk,'' the group's last big hit. When their American 
success declined in the 1970s, The Drifters found popularity in 
Britain.

<HEADLINE> Rookie Backs Seek Playoff Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Robert Edwards and Fred Taylor were  
thrown into this together as college seniors, traveling the winding 
circuit of all-star games, scouting combines and NFL draft parties. 
</P>
<P>
	The running backs became friends, then went their separate ways  
-- Taylor to Jacksonville, Edwards to New England -- each enjoying 
successful and remarkably similar rookie seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But only one will be able to say his first year included a  
playoff victory. 
</P>
<P>
	And when the Jaguars (11-5) play the Patriots (9-7) in a  
wild-card playoff game Sunday, it could be the best test yet of 
which team got a better bargain with its first-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a lot of people say it's going to be me versus Robert  
Edwards, but it's not,'' said Taylor, who rushed for 1,223 yards 
this season to 1,115 for Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, if he does something spectacular, of course, I want to  
do something spectacular to make the crowd go crazy. But it's not 
going to get into a little grudge match between me and him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About a year ago, on the same field where they'll meet this  
weekend, it was. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor was a senior at Florida, going through a mild slump.  
Edwards was in his final year at Georgia and the Bulldogs were 
rising. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards got the best of Taylor that day, rushing for 124 yards  
and four touchdowns, as the Bulldogs won 37-17 to snap a seven-game 
losing streak in one of college football's big rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was great, I didn't do squat,'' Taylor said.  
</P>
<P>
	Both players have tried to put that game behind them, but Taylor  
believes Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin could have saved some time with 
his scouting report this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just ripped us apart,'' Taylor said. ``His speed is  
deceptive until you get beside him. That's when you'll know he's 
fast. And until you try to tackle him, that's when you'll know how 
much power he has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Edwards has thrived on bouncing off the pile and spinning  
out of tackles, Taylor has done it with a mix of power and speed 
not everyone recognized on draft day when the Jaguars took him with 
the ninth choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, selected 18th, is one of Taylor's biggest fans and says  
Taylor has a few things he wishes he did. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 10 pounds heavier than I am, he has quicker feet, much  
quicker,'' Edwards said. ``He's more of a slasher, he has good 
shoulder fakes and great quickness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both backs know there will be even more pressure on them in this  
game, with New England's Drew Bledsoe out because of a broken 
finger and Jacksonville's Mark Brunell expected to play on an 
injured ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the kind of role Edwards might have expected, coming to  
New England after Curtis Martin left for the New York Jets. Taylor, 
on the other hand, was simply looking to blend in. Then, James 
Stewart was injured in the season's third game. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus started a true rookie rushing race, with Taylor coming out  
on top. It was a result that surprised him and many around the NFL, 
who noticed him on the bench to begin the season and wondered if 
the Jaguars had made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole thing was, I was going to try to take it slow, learn  
the system so I wouldn't hesitate and not make mistakes if I got 
the chance,'' Taylor said. ``I had no idea they were going to throw 
me into the fire. When they did, luckily I knew everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards overcame injuries that nagged at him in college and was  
thrust into a big role early. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he didn't record his first 100-yard game until Week 5. He  
had another the following week, but followed with a slump, failing 
to surpass 70 yards for seven straight weeks. A 196-yard 
performance against St. Louis Dec. 13 put him back in range of 
Taylor, and the 1,000-yard mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Taylor, Edwards said the humbling moments have been as  
important to him as the successful ones this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have both realized that this is the NFL,'' Edwards said,  
``and we weren't going to have great games every week like we did 
in college.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But both backs know the time for learning is over. The playoffs  
have arrived and only one will continue along the winding road of a 
successful rookie season.

<HEADLINE> Key Points of New Nixon Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Richard Nixon found much to complain about during his 5 1/2 years  
in the White House, according to still-secret recordings summarized 
by appraiser Steve Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the targets of Nixon's ire:  
</P>
<P>
	--Agnew. Nixon complained in 1970 that then-Vice President Spiro  
Agnew was being sent to big cities to give speeches. Nixon felt the 
White House ``should save larger places'' for him. 
</P>
<P>
	--His reputation. Nixon directed aide H.R. Haldeman to ``find  
quotes where commentators and others wrote Nixon off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Leaks. After a memo about negotiations with the Soviet Union  
was leaked, Nixon met with aides and suggested that the 300,000 
people in government with top secret security clearances be given 
lie detector tests. 
</P>
<P>
	--His press secretary. Complaining that he was not getting good  
public relations exposure, he said Press Secretary Ron Ziegler was 
grossly inept. 
</P>
<P>
	--Henry Kissinger's prominence. Unhappy with the amount of  
attention paid his foreign policy adviser, Nixon ordered on Dec. 
15, 1972, that Kissinger should not see Time magazine reporters 
under any circumstances, should do no interviews, have no social 
meetings and return no phone calls. ``He wants White House staff to 
talk about the president when they get a chance, never about 
Kissinger,'' Johnson notes, adding that Nixon pleaded with aide 
John D. Ehrlichman, ``Please to let him do it his way just this one 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--His news summary. The staff-prepared roundup, Nixon said,  
should be revamped ``to emphasize the positive rather than the 
negative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The press. Anyone who talks to Time reporters, Nixon told  
Ziegler on Jan. 22, 1973, ``should have their resignations 
requested within one minute.'' He discusses the idea of leaking 
false information to the Washington Post and CBS ``to throw them 
off and make them look unreliable.'' Nixon said he was distressed 
that Time ran a cover story about actor Marlon Brando during 
inauguration week in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	--His photo. Near the end of his first term, Nixon expressed  
unhappiness to Ziegler about a photograph of him on public display. 
``The president feels he needs a new smiling photograph on the 
walls of federal buildings,'' Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> Aikman Has Edge Over Plummer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Troy Aikman is the ultimate playoff  
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	His competitive nature kicks his playoff performance up a notch  
when he's leading the Dallas Cowboys in a game with elimination on 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman, who is 11-2 in playoff games, admits he functions better  
under the postseason pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the finality of a playoff game,'' Aikman said. ``You  
have to get the job done. There are no excuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the big advantages the Cowboys will have in Saturday's  
playoff game against the Arizona Cardinals is Aikman's leadership 
experience in big games. He has three Super Bowl rings to prove he 
thrives in the playoff atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something to be said about playoffs experience,''  
Aikman said. ``I view it as a positive but it can be overrated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Cardinals haven't been in a playoff game since  
1982, Aikman said this year's Arizona team knows how to play under 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been in a lot of games they had to win to get into the  
playoffs and I'm sure it felt like a playoff game to them,'' Aikman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman's playoff experience is in contrast to none for Arizona's  
Jake Plummer, who has engineered six comebacks in the fourth 
quarter this season for the Cardinals, who finished 9-7 to earn a 
wild-card behind the NFC East champion Cowboys (10-6). 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman has played against Plummer twice this season. Dallas beat  
Arizona 38-10 in the opener, but had to hold off a rally to defeat 
the Cardinals 35-28 in the rematch. Plummer passed for 314 yards in 
the second half of the second game. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman was impressed by the energetic Plummer.  
</P>
<P>
	``Jake is a good young player,'' Aikman said. ``He's very  
athletic and does a good job giving them a spark. He will be a 
great player at some point. He'll get better as his supporting cast 
gets better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman is more of a pocket passer, while Plummer can unreel some  
wild scrambles. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman said the Cardinals, who have lost nine consecutive games  
in Texas Stadium, always pose a threat for the Cowboys despite 
Arizona's record against them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be any different Saturday,'' Aikman said. ``They  
always play us tough. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman said he was depressed at this time last season when the  
Cowboys finished a 6-10 season that cost coach Barry Switzer his 
job. Owner Jerry Jones then hired Pittsburgh offensive coordinator 
Chan Gailey to replace Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough the way the whole season went last year,'' Aikman  
said. ``It was a relief for all of us when it was over. We had been 
accustomed to being in the playoffs. I'm proud of the way we 
handled all the adversity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer, who recently signed a $29 million contract in only his  
second season, said he's looking at the game as a fun time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever it takes to do to win I'll try it,'' Plummer said.  
``The fact the Cowboys have a lot of experience could work in their 
favor, but I hope it won't make any difference. This will be fun, a 
first time experience. We'll just try to stay cool.''

<HEADLINE> Help-Wanted Ads Rose in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Help-wanted advertising in major U.S. newspapers  
climbed in November, indicating demand for jobs remains strong, 
according to a study released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private business research group, said  
its monthly advertising index rose to 91 last month, up four points 
from 87 in October. The index was 93 in November 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great American job machine is not broken,'' said  
Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein. ``It isn't even 
slowing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's unemployment rate in November fell to a six-month  
low of 4.4 percent, down 0.2 percentage point from 4.6 percent in 
both the previous month and November 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the nation's nine regions saw an increase in  
help-wanted advertising sales in November. Only the mountain 
region, which includes Arizona, Colorado and Utah, saw a decline, 
and just by one point. The largest increases were in the west north 
central region, which includes Minnesota, Missouri and Nebraska, 
and the mid-Atlantic states, including New York and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The seasonally adjusted advertising index, which stood at 100 in  
the base year 1987, is derived from measuring the volume of 
employment ads in 51 major newspapers across the country each 
month. It is used as a non-governmental gauge of changes in local, 
regional and national job supply.

<HEADLINE> Dow Chemical To Appeal Court Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Dow Chemical will ask the Nevada Supreme Court  
to reconsider its decision to uphold a $4.2 million award to a Las 
Vegas woman in a breast-implant case, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled 4-1 on Thursday that Charlotte Mahlum wasn't  
entitled to $10 million in punitive damages. But in a 3-2 vote, it 
kept intact $4.2 million in compensatory damages, affirming the 
jury's conclusion that the silicone implants made Mahlum sick. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury also found that Dow Chemical had a duty to ensure the  
safety of the implants made by Dow Corning, once the largest maker 
of silicone implants. Dow Chemical owns 50 percent of Dow Corning. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Chemical spokesman John Musser said courts in California,  
New York and Michigan have examined essentially the same evidence 
and determined Dow Chemical was not liable for Dow Corning's 
implants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the court's finding is unprecedented and  
inconsistent with previous court rulings across the country,'' 
Musser said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada ruling could effectively make any consultant who does  
testing on behalf of a client responsible for that client's 
product, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahlum alleged that her breast implants ruptured, causing brain  
lesions, nerve damage, blotchy skin, aching, memory problems and 
seizures.

	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- The American Basketball League, which

 *Church Disaster Relief Goes Cyber    	
</P>
<P>
	OELLA, Md. (AP) -- Jim Skillington no longer preaches full time  
from the pulpit, but by no means has he given up God's work. He 
keeps very busy working on an Internet news service focusing 
exclusively on disasters and chronicling the work of church-based 
relief groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Disaster News Network (www.disasternews.net) contains  
human-interest articles from disaster sites in the United States 
and territories, a database of church-based agencies, and links to 
aid groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site, operational since May, was conceived by  
Skillington and is sponsored by Church World Service, a New 
York-based coalition of 34 denominations. 
</P>
<P>
	Skillington, who preached for more than eight years in Silver  
Spring and continues to preach part-time at Baltimore-area 
churches, said he is fulfilling God's directive by running DNN and 
helping those in need. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my ministry,'' said Skillington, 48. ``Our goal is to  
provide information. Our goal is to connect people who want to make 
a difference. This is fascinating stuff. These are stories crying 
out to be told.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This month, the Web site has stories about how disaster groups  
are having to spend thousands of dollars to store unwanted items 
that people donated after Hurricane Mitch; the need for volunteers 
in central Florida, where tornadoes killed 42 people in February; 
and how neighbors are helping neighbors in Texas after devastating 
floods in October. 
</P>
<P>
	No individual church site has as much information as DNN, said  
Stan Hankins of Presbyterian Disaster Response, based in 
Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really didn't have any similar communication vehicle prior  
to establishing this Web site,'' said Hankins, a member of DNN's 
board of directors. ``The ultimate goal is to be a service to those 
in need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skillington, a former investigative journalist whose experience  
includes working at the Frederick (Md.) News-Post, demands 
hard-news and human-interest stories from his five free-lancers. 
</P>
<P>
	He knows he can't compete with major media outlets -- the DNN  
budget for this year is $75,000 and $94,000 for 1999 -- and so he's 
perfecting the art of follow-up journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing what DNN seeks to cover, he says: ``the human side.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about the little old lady who ... can't cook  
because she's got a tree in her kitchen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lacking the funds to send reporters to disaster sites  
immediately, Skillington and his seven free-lancers around the 
country work the phones and manage to tell compelling stories. For 
instance, on Sept. 22, the day Hurricane Georges slammed into 
Puerto Rico, Skillington wrote the story based on telephone 
reporting from his office in a former cotton mill. 
</P>
<P>
	The stories that DNN covers range from warnings of disasters to  
spot reports on them to relief efforts long after the mainstream 
media depart the scene. One of the principal attractions of the Web 
site is a database that lists volunteer opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Skillington says the site is getting some 250,000 hits per  
month, and he expects that number to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	He is a virtual one-man news room -- he gathers tips, assigns

	Sponsoring church groups say establishing DNN was a priority  
because those affected by disasters and those wanting to help the 
needy didn't have one place they could turn to. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Augsburger, director of emergency response programs at  
Church World Services, said the umbrella group's Web site is 
designed more for other church groups to share information, whereas 
DNN is geared toward the public. 
</P>
<P>
	DNN's principal goal isn't to raise funds, but to raise  
``consciousness and appreciation of what faith-based disaster 
organizations do,'' said Linda Petrucelli of the United Church of 
Christ in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were using this just to try and get money, that would be  
selfish,'' she said. ``It's really for people who are in need.''

<HEADLINE> Bomb Found in S.F. Warehouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A utility worker has been arrested after  
authorities discovered a bomb and bomb-making materials at two 
Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ready-to-go explosives'' and raw material, including calcium  
nitrate and more than 250 pounds of ammonium nitrate, were found 
Thursday at the downtown warehouses, said Special Agent Tracy Hite 
of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional evidence was found at the home of Paul Madronich, 44,  
who has worked at the utility for 19 years, Hite said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ammonium nitrate, commonly used as fertilizer, was combined with  
fuel oil to make the 4,800-pound bomb that destroyed the Oklahoma 
City federal building in 1995, killing 168 people. Calcium nitrate, 
also a fertilizer, was found at the house of bombing conspirator 
Terry Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
	Madronich is accused of possessing a destructive device,  
possessing a destructive device in a public place and possessing of 
a destructive device as a public nuisance. He was being held in San 
Francisco County Jail on $55,000 bail and will be formally charged 
Tuesday in municipal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Hite said that the bomb did not contain ammonium nitrate and  
that authorities were analyzing it to determine its contents. Hite 
declined to speculate on a motive and would not say whether others 
were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no basis or any information to suggest this is related  
to domestic terrorism,'' said police spokesman Sherman Ackerson, 
who added that Madronich may have had been interested in making 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said ``there's significant information, significant  
material to show there's a bomb-making operation going on, and so 
we're being very cautious now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The operation was discovered after a PG&AMP;E employee found water  
in a warehouse basement and followed the trail. Upstairs, the 
worker found 250 pounds of ammonium nitrate thawing inside a 
storage locker. 
</P>
<P>
	Police ordered approximately 30 workers out of the building and  
evacuated another across the street out of fear that the fertilizer 
had been mixed with volatile substances and frozen to keep it from 
exploding. 
</P>
<P>
	A 33-gallon drum of chemicals and books on making bombs were  
found elsewhere in the building, as were a ``small quantity of 
actual ready-to-go explosives,'' Ackerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than six hours after the material was found in the first  
warehouse, police had Madronich in custody for questioning. He 
later led officers to a second PG&AMP;E facility nearby, where 
officials found ``a whole bunch more bomb-making stuff,'' Ackerson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could blow up a house. It could probably destroy a regular  
residence,'' said police Sgt. Mark Potter. 
</P>
<P>
	PG&AMP;E spokesman Scott Blakey said there was no reason for  
ammonium nitrate to be in the warehouses, which are located in a 
mixed residential and industrial area in the city's Mission 
District. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been the target of sabotage in the past,  
including vandalism that caused a blackout in October 1997. Blakey 
said there had been no recent threats against the utility. 
</P>
<P>
	Madronich, who has no local criminal record, has served as a  
leak surveyor in PG&AMP;E's gas construction department, PG&AMP;E 
spokeswoman Maureen Bogues said. She declined to comment on the 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary, you know, because we're innocent, I guess, and  
don't want to be the victim of this,'' said PG&AMP;E employee Zenna 
Gotera.

<HEADLINE> Calif.: Kaiser Must Cover Viagra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California has ordered Kaiser  
Foundation Health Plan to continue covering all sexual dysfunction 
treatments, including the drug Viagra. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser had argued that subsidizing impotence pills for some men  
would unfairly raise insurance costs for all members. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision on Thursday by the state Department of Corporations  
could affect every health plan in California. It means that Kaiser 
Permanente cannot specify sexual function drugs and treatments as 
supplemental benefits available at a higher premium. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the HMO must continue paying at least half of the  
roughly $80 it costs to provide a monthly dose of Viagra to men. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser spokesman Tom Debley said the HMO had no plans to contest  
the ruling, which he estimated would add about $1 to a monthly 
Kaiser premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser has made similar applications in every state in which it  
operates. So far, 12 have allowed it to drop Viagra. California 
yesterday became the third state after New York and Connecticut to 
require coverage of the drug. Kaiser still has a similar request 
pending in the state of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the differences between the states, I think there's  
still an important disagreement over whether drugs like this should

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Avert TV Blackout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Dolphins averted the NFL's first local  
playoff blackout in five years when Miami station WPLG-TV agreed to 
purchase any unsold tickets for Saturday's game against the Buffalo 
Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2,400 tickets remained available Friday night, the Dolphins  
said. The NFL this week granted the Dolphins three extensions on 
the deadline for imposing a blackout. 
</P>
<P>
	The league has not enforced a local blackout of a playoff game  
since the Green Bay Packers played at Detroit in January 1994. The 
Dolphins had sold out eight consecutive home playoff games since 
the 1983 season.

<HEADLINE> Six Die in Minnesota House Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEYLON, Minn. (AP) -- A fire engulfed a two-story wooden house on  
New Year's Day, killing six people, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25 fire fighters from five volunteer departments battled  
the morning blaze in extreme cold. The cause appeared to be a 
defective heater in the attached garage, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed were Kathleen Hatfield, 60, her son, Alfred Hatfield, 40,  
and his three children, ages 8, 7 and 3. The sixth victim was Jenny 
Hoffmeyer, 22, a family friend who had been staying at the home. 
</P>
<P>
	Ceylon is just north of the Iowa state line, about 100 miles  
southwest of Minneapolis.

<HEADLINE> Families Mourn 6 Yacht Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOBART, Australia (AP) -- Mourners dropped a red rose and a bed  
of daisies into a river today in remembrance of each of the six 
sailors killed in Australia's disastrous Sydney-to-Hobart yacht 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	As the rosettes bobbed in the Derwent River, the glorious summer  
weather could scarcely have contrasted more sharply with the 
howling winds and mountainous seas that ravaged the race fleet five 
days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 115 yachts in this year's race, 70 withdrew because of the  
hurricane-strength winds. Rescuers saved about 50 sailors from 
seven damaged or sunken craft. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 people attended the ceremony on Constitution Dock in  
Hobart, on the island of Tasmania. Many of the yachts that survived 
the race were tied up at the dock. 
</P>
<P>
	The memorial service began with a fly-over of airplanes in a  
``missing man'' formation. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsignor Phillip Green, speaking from a table draped by a green  
and gold sail, noted that for more than 50 years, Constitution Dock 
was a haven at the end of a race -- a place where rivalries were 
forgotten and friendships forged. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Guy, who died on his yacht, the Business Post Naiad, gave  
100 percent to life, said his daughter, Karen Guy. Phil Skeggs was 
also lost on Naiad. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Kulmar of the Sword of Orion spoke of the dedication to  
sailing of his dead friend, British yachtsman Glyn Charles. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a bloody good bloke,'' Kulmar said.  
</P>
<P>
	Richard Winning of the yacht Winston Churchill said he would  
always remember Jim Lawler, John Dean and Mike Bannister. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sea was so vast and the ship was so small,'' Winning said.  
``Man and everything made by man is finite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he hoped the dead men's families took some comfort from  
knowing that they died doing something they loved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will learn from the tragic circumstances of your deaths,''  
said Hugo van Kretschmar, the head of the Cruising Yacht Club of 
Australia, which organized the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will miss you always,'' he said. ``We will remember you  
always.''

<P>
	From Times Square to the Space Needle, hundreds of thousands of  
people celebrated amid pyrotechnics, balloons and confetti as they 
ushered in the new year with an eye toward the real party 365 days 
from now. 
</P>
<P>
	In short, a party like it's 1999.  
</P>
<P>
	Bundled in layers and wrapped in blankets, an estimated 500,000  
people jammed Times Square in 20-degree weather that felt more like 
zero in the wind chill. 
</P>
<P>
	Three ... two ... one ... Happy New Year!  
</P>
<P>
	``It's beautiful, Moet &AMP; Chandon, New York, fireworks. ... I  
love it,'' said Opher Heyman, 24, of Miami as he tipped a plastic 
glass of champagne toward a flashing 1999 sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most awesome thing I've ever seen,'' Shari Rossoy  
of St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	At the stroke of midnight, more than 15,000 balloons showered  
the crowd and fireworks and 42 spotlights -- including the ``50K 
Space Cannon'' -- illuminated the sky. The light cannon is said to 
be visible from Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Chinese gymnast Sang Lan, paralyzed  
in a fall at last summer's Goodwill Games, pressed the button that 
sent the New Year's Eve ball on its last, slow descent at One Times 
Square. It will be replaced by a Waterford Crystal ball for New 
Year's Eve 1999. 
</P>

	Midnight meant fireworks at Seattle's Space Needle. And in  
Boston, with a cacophony and burst of color to rival any Mardi 
Gras, a parade of costumed monsters and the planets of the solar 
system kicked off the city's First Night festivities, culminating 
in midnight fireworks over Boston Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't exactly Times Square, but about 5,000 people gathered  
in the Lake Erie resort city of Port Clinton, Ohio, to welcome 1999 
with a salute to the town's biggest industry -- sport fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd braved the 15-degree weather to watch a large  
Fiberglas walleye lowered from a crane. 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas authorities had canceled many outdoor activities to  
control the crowd this year. Still, an estimated 250,000 to 400,000 
lined the Strip as the clock struck midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Local resident Matt Berry, 25, opted for a subdued celebration.  
</P>
<P>
	``The past two years we would go with the crowd, but that was  
just too tiring,'' said Berry as he sat in a lawn chair, wrapped in 
a blanket. ``This year we're just people watching. Next year we may 
go to Pasadena because we think they'll have trouble controlling 
the crowds here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just across the state line, in South Lake Tahoe, Calif., some  
revelers got a little too rowdy, as police arrested more than 100 
people at a street party. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's typical New Year's craziness, bizarreness,'' said Leona  
Allen, a South Lake Tahoe police dispatcher. ``It's just one major 
orgy and it gets really, really ugly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A celebration was canceled in New Orleans after fireworks being  
loaded onto a barge exploded minutes before the craft was to be 
towed into the Mississippi River for a New Year's Eve display. Two 
fireworks technicians were killed and a sheriff's deputy was 
severely burned. 
</P>
<P>
	For many organizers, this year's celebrations served as a  
run-through for the next New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	In Las Vegas, authorities say as many as 700,000 people will  
welcome in the new millennium on the Strip next December. Police 
used Thursday night to gauge how well they might be able to control 
next year's crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're expecting next year to be very large,'' said Steve  
Meriwether, a Las Vegas police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers of the Times Square bash tested some of the special  
effects planned for next time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We only get one chance to try this out live,'' said Jeffrey  
Strauss, president of Countdown Entertainment, a marketing company 
that represents the ball and the building on which it sits. 
</P>
<P>
	South of the square, the Coney Island Arctic Ice Bears  
celebrated the New Year with their traditional dip in the Hudson 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very healthy,'' said Michael Polishchuk, 57, a club  
member who plunged into the chilly water. ``After, you feel like a 
newborn baby, the skin becomes pink, it's very good for the 
blood.''

<HEADLINE> Heston: Prostate Cancer Almost Gone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Charlton Heston is battling prostate cancer  
but says he is on the road to recovery after weeks of intense 
radiation treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not totally gone but it's on the path to it,'' the  
Academy Award-winning actor said Friday from his home in the Los 
Angeles Santa Monica Mountains. ``Happily, I seemed to have 
survived. It's very good news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he found out about the cancer during his annual checkup  
and prostate screening in June. Doctors agreed to let Heston, who 
is active in politics and is president of the National Rifle 
Association, postpone radiation treatment until after the November 
election so he could stump for Republican candidates and continue 
shooting a film. 
</P>
<P>
	Heston, 75, underwent the treatment for six to seven weeks,  
finishing last month. He said he went to the University of 
California, Los Angeles Medical Center about 7 a.m. five days a 
week to receive treatment and then went to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got this huge machine, they zap you and you go on  
about your day's work,'' he said. ``You're in and out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He currently is shooting ``Town and Country,'' a comedy also  
starring Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn. It is his 
75th film and third comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Heston said he will have another checkup in several weeks. No  
surgery is planned but he may undergo radioactive seed implants. 
The implants deliver a strong dose of radiation to the prostate but 
deliver little radiation to other organs. 
</P>
<P>
	Heston won an Oscar for ``Ben Hur'' in 1959. He also starred in  
films such as ``The Ten Commandments,'' ``El Cid,'' and ``Planet of 
the Apes.'' He has been an outspoken advocate of gun rights and 
active campaigner for Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Heston said he also plans to star in a play in Britain in the  
summer, but hasn't decided yet what role he will choose.

	Snow fell across parts of the Midwest and New England on New  
Year's Day. Bitter cold continued its grip on the Northeast, while 
skies cleared over the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Midwest braced for a strong winter storm.  
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters were calling for more than a foot of snow in some  
parts Illinois and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't advise travel at all ... especially with the strong  
winds,'' said Robin Smith, a meteorologist the National Weather 
Service in Joliet. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake effect snows continued to stream off lakes Ontario and  
Erie. Light snow was scattered across Maine and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	A low pressure system moved out of the northern Rockies,  
producing areas of light snow in the northern Plains.A few 
thundershowers rumbled over eastern Texas, in eastern Oklahoma, and 
near the Arkansas border. 
</P>
<P>
	High pressure moved into the Pacific Northwest, providing the  
region with a much-needed break in the precipitation as rivers and 
streams continued to run at and just below flood stage across 
Washington and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures across the Lower 48 ranged from a low of minus 36  
in International Falls, Minn., to an afternoon high of 78 in Miami 
and Fort Lauderdale, Fla. With the wind chill, it felt like minus 
59 in Grand Marais, Minn.

<HEADLINE> 1999 Arrives on East Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thousands upon thousands of revelers converged  
on Times Square on New Year's Eve to party like it's 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Bundled in layers of clothing, blankets and thermal wraps, a  
boisterous crowd predicted to reach as many as 500,000 gathered to 
ring in the New Year in 20-degree weather that felt well below zero 
with the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	At the stroke of midnight, more than 15,000 balloons showered  
the crowd and fireworks and 42 spotlights -- including the so-called 
``50K Space Cannon'' -- illuminated the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, it's 1999. The last time in the century. I figured why  
not,'' said Garrison Whittaker of Washington D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Heather Long, 19, of Atlantic City wrapped herself in five  
layers of clothing, two blankets and a foil wrap to celebrate in 
the square with host and perennial teen-ager Dick Clark, who was 
shepherding in the new year for television viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I forgot was to put on more socks,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	As celebrations began in cities across the country, tragedy  
struck near New Orleans. Fireworks and other missiles exploded in 
the staging area for a midnight celebration, killing two workmen 
and injuring a deputy sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the explosion wasn't immediately known.  
</P>
<P>
	In Las Vegas, where police predicted as many as 400,000 people  
would line the Strip, Matt Berry, 25, and Kristy Shore, 21, were in 
lawn chairs in front of Caesars Palace, watching the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``The past two years we would go with the crowd, but that was  
just too tiring,'' said Berry, wrapped in a blanket against a 
chilly wind. ``This year we're just people watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Boston's Copley Square, thousands of revelers watched as ice  
sculptors put the final touches on a frozen display that included a 
castle and a knight in armor battling a dragon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really, really, really good!'' exclaimed 6-year-old Paige  
Roosa, who viewed the display perched atop her the shoulders of her 
father Andy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose Mabuney, 56, of Los Angeles sat on a folding stool in the  
middle of Times Square, her legs covered by a blanket and a 
portable propane heater at her feet. She and another couple were 
taking turns warming up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just met a couple that had set this up,'' she said. ``They  
let me sit here for awhile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, the finishing touches were put on a 16-foot  
Father Time puppet, a 15,000-balloon release, a spotlight said to 
be visible from Mars, and the final drop of a 500-pound aluminum 
ball that has ushered in every New Year since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball will be replaced by a Waterford Crystal-made successor  
next December. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Chinese gymnast Sang Lan, 
who was paralyzed in a fall at the Goodwill Games, pressed the 
button that started the ball's drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the folks in Lebanon, Pa., were planning the Second  
Annual New Year's Eve Bologna Drop. The Lebanon Valley Sertoma Club 
was to lower a 100-pound, 7-foot cylinder of smoked bologna from 
the roof of the Lebanon Unfinished Furniture building. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fayetteville, Ark., the city was having its first  
family-oriented First Night celebration, an outdoor festival that 
includes artisans, musicians, food, jugglers and midnight 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to party like it's 1999,'' said Nancy Hendricks,  
assistant to the mayor. ``This is a way for young people to spend 
New Year's Eve with their families and also a way for people to see 
you can have a wonderfully good time without getting wasted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Worcester, Mass., this year's party was to have a medieval  
theme, hence a change in name to First Knight. Organizers hoped 
City Hall would feel like a medieval castle, with lords and ladies, 
jesters and dragons. 
</P>
<P>
	New Year's Eve was perhaps not so festive for the roughly 10,000  
customers still without power in Virginia since an ice storm on 
Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Branson, Mo., the folks at the Chateau on the Lake were  
promising New Year's Eve would be a night to remember. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotel constructed a replica of the bow of the Titanic and  
placed it in its 32,000-square-foot Great Hall. There, 500 party 
guests were to dine on the same seven-course meal the Titanic 
passengers ate just before the ship struck an iceberg and went down 
in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, a few hardy people took off most of their clothes  
for a swim in the Hudson River, which at about 40 degrees wasn't 
much warmer than an iceberg. Four members of the Coney Island 
Arctic Ice Bears completed the 200-yard swim. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Jones, a 37-year-old former Mr. America and president of the  
Arctic Ice Bears, had to be rescued by a police scuba unit after 
suffering cramps near the halfway point in the swim. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're only 4 percent body fat, sometimes it's tough,''  
he said after the rescue. ``It's still the greatest feeling in the 
world though.''

	A storm system forming over the Plains was expected to bring  
gusting winds and up to a foot of snow to parts of the Midwest by 
tonight before barreling into the East Coast this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow was forecast from Kansas and Nebraska to Indiana, and north  
into the Great Lakes region. Blizzard conditions were possible amid 
40-mph gusts. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana residents spent New Year's Eve stocking up on groceries,  
salt and snow shovels. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been unbelievable,'' said Ed Delph, manager of a home  
improvement store in Greenwood. ``It's like they're all out just 
buying everything now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farther south, freezing rain turning and snow were likely in  
southern portions of Kansas and Missouri by tonight. Hail was 
expected along the Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the system, several inches of snow was forecast for the  
mountains of Colorado and New Mexico, with winds gusting to 50 mph 
in some places. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for scattered snow across northern New England, the rest  
of the nation was expected to see dry and mostly calm weather on 
the first day of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of the East -- including Virginia, where several thousand  
residents were still without power eight days after an ice storm -- 
received several inches of snow Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest temperature in the continental United States on  
Thursday was 81 at Gila Bend, Ariz. The low was minus-23 at Clayton 
Lake, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Highs today were forecast to reach the single digits and teens  
across New England and the Plains; the 20s and 30s in the Midwest 
and Rockies; the 40s and 50s in the Southeast and Northwest; and 
the 60s and 70s in the Southwest and southern parts of Texas and 
Florida.

<HEADLINE> Six Die in Minn. House Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEYLON, Minn. (AP) -- A defective heater in a garage was  
suspected of causing an early morning fire that engulfed a 
two-story wooden house and killed six people inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of those who died New Year's Day were members of one family  
and the sixth was a family friend, Martin County authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe the fire started in a wall-mounted propane  
gas heater in the garage. The flames were spotted at 5:45 a.m. by 
Barb Cuppy, the mother of one of the victims, who lives across the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were identified as Kathleen A. Hatfield, 60; her  
son, Alfred Hatfield, 40; and his three children, 8-year-old son 
JaJa, 7-year-old daughter Brenna, and 3-year-old son Brandon. The 
sixth victim was Jenny Hoffmeyer, 22, Ms. Cuppy's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The house had fire detectors, and it appeared some of the  
victims were trying to get out, said Wayne Harder, chief of the 
volunteer fire department in Ceylon, about 120 miles southwest of 
Minneapolis.

<HEADLINE> Jack Paar Gets Get-Well Wishes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- You've got mail, Jack Paar.  
</P>
<P>
	The late-night television pioneer recovering from quadruple  
bypass surgery is getting get-well wishes from friends and fans via 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Paar, who was host of the ``Tonight Show,'' before Johnny  
Carson, is featured on a Web site for Regis Philbin's daytime show, 
``Live! With Regis and Kathie Lee.'' Visitors to the Web site can 
click on a picture of Paar and write him a short note of 
encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Paar doesn't actually surf the Net himself, Philbin and  
another friend, Charles Grodin, have the messages printed and send 
them to Paar's home in Greenwich, Conn., according to Friday's 
editions of The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are really cheering his spirits,'' said Michael Macari  
Jr., president of a media production company helping the 
80-year-old Paar compile his archives. ``We've probably given him 
four or five hundred so far.''

<HEADLINE> Electronics Switching to Digital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The cool new high tech gadget everyone's  
talking about these days is something we've been watching in our 
living rooms for almost 60 years. But in 1999, say consumer 
electronics aficionados, television gets a whole new look. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new digital television is not your grandfather's  
television,'' said Jeff Joseph, vice president of the Consumer 
Electronics Manufacturers Association in Arlington, Va. ``It's 
amazing. It has an enormous 'Wow!' factor. Anytime consumers see 
it, their eyes pop out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Television viewers may think that their football game, soap  
opera or science show looks fine as it is. But when a show is 
broadcasted digitally onto a high definition television, the action 
appears disturbingly lifelike, nearly three dimensional. 
</P>
<P>
	A football kicked in the direction of the camera makes couch  
potatoes flinch. A Sunday evening tearjerker calls for an extra box 
of tissues. And those medical science shows, which were always a 
bit nauseating, are downright knee tremblers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the high definition digital television debuted Nov. 1,  
its introduction as a mainstream consumer item comes Jan. 7 to Jan. 
10 at the 1999 International Consumer Electronics Show in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	There, among the 90,000 product developers, financiers,  
investors, venture capitalists, reporters, exhibitors and actual 
consumers, the crisp and clear digital televisions and their makers 
are expected to be the darlings of the world's largest annual trade 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people may have heard of digital television, but at  
CES they're finally going to see it,'' said Kevin Hause, analyst 
with International Data Corp. of Framingham, Mass. ``It's finally 
time for consumers to get a really good look at them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Television stations in more than 40 cities are now airing  
high-definition broadcasts, but most Americans are missing the show 
because they haven't been willing to shell out the $5,000 to 
$12,000 for a new set and tuner that show the brighter, 
crystal-clear images. Prices, though, are expected to drop 10 to 20 
percent in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who have bought the new sets can now only watch a handful  
of shows because broadcasters are also only slowly making the 
shift. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's going to change in 1999, says Sony Corp. chairman  
Howard Stringer, who will open the electronics show with a 
discussion about how consumer technology and the entertainment 
industry are irrevocably joined in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Stringer will also be helping present a digital television mega  
session -- a plethora of booths, speeches and demonstrations where 
people who make and sell the new televisions can present their 
newest ideas and products. 
</P>
<P>
	While televisions are the biggest item making the high-tech  
shift, technology is also making a leap in other consumer goods 
such as telephones and VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears we're going to go through an evolution from analog  
to digital,'' said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, 
Inc. in Campbell, Calif. ``It's a fascinating change, and certainly 
the buzz of industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Electricity travels through either analog or digital signals.  
Analog signals are generated directly, like a light hitting a 
camera picture tube. They can be converted through converters into 
digital signals that are composed entirely of ones and zeros. A lot 
more can be done with digital information because it can be 
manipulated by computers and is more immune to noise. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, digital VCRs can now record on a hard drive instead  
of cassettes, a function that allows television watchers to set up 
their own instant replays and pauses during broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital video discs play both music and movies on a five-inch  
disc with CD-quality sound. And digital telephones can package 
Caller ID and an answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
	With the touch of a button, users of digital camcorders can  
create special effects including fade, dissolve and scroll up or 
down. And digital audio is bringing movie theater-like surround 
sound into the living room. 
</P>
<P>
	The new technologies are expected to help the electronics  
industry continue its strong and steady growth. In 1998, consumer 
electronics companies sold $76 billion of products to retailers, up 
$4 billion from 1997, according to the consumer electronics 
association.

	U.S. Links to Khmer Rouge Discussed  
</P>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- An aide to Khmer Rouge defectors who  
may soon face charges of crimes against humanity warned that any 
trial would expose the roles of the United States and China in the 
movement's brutal rise to power. ``Implementing a trial would also 
involve the 200 days and nights of bombing in Cambodia,'' aide Long 
Norin said in reference to the U.S. carpet bombing of Cambodia in 
the early 1970s. Earlier today, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen 
said Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, members of Khmer Rouge leader Pol 
Pot's inner circle during the group's brutal 1975-79 rule, must be 
tried for helping draw up the movement's genocidal policies.

	Chicago Is Nation's Murder Capital  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Despite experiencing a 10-year low in murders,  
Chicago now ranks as the nation's murder capital for 1998, 
according to preliminary data gathered from cities across America. 
Chicago had 698 homicides in 1998, surpassing New York City's 
homicide totals for the first time ever. Although the city's 
violent crime rate has dropped consistently in last decade (it 
dropped 20 percent overall between 1990 and 1997), it still lags 
behind the other largest cities. In that same period, New York City 
cut its violent crime rate 47 percent.

	Gov. Sees Setback in Campaign Probe  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a setback for the Justice Department's  
campaign fund-raising investigation, a federal judge has dismissed 
much of the case against a Thai businesswoman who raised 
substantial funds for the Democratic Party. U.S. District Judge 
Paul L. Friedman yesterday threw out 11 counts against Pauline 
Kanchanalak, a key figure in the investigation of foreign money 
raised in the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election campaign. Friedman's 
ruling yesterday followed earlier decisions that threw out much of 
the Justice Department's cases against two other defendants in the 
foreign money probe, Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie and Maria Hsia.

	Repairman Arrested for Explosives  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A utility repairman was in custody today  
after authorities discovered bomb materials, including 250 pounds 
of ammonium nitrate, the same ingredient used in the Oklahoma City 
bombing, at his workplace. Paul Joseph Madronich Jr., 44, enjoyed 
making small explosives and fireworks and did not appear to have a 
political agenda, according to investigators. Police believe he was 
using the material for small explosives such as cherry bombs and 
M-80s that he sold to co-workers.

	New Alzheimer's Scan Developed  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Researchers at New York University have developed  
a new brain-scanning method that may be able to detect Alzheimer's 
disease in its early stages, according to a new study. People with 
Alzheimer's develop characteristic microscopic changes in the 
brain, but because they are not easily seen on a scan, doctors 
don't normally test for them. In research published in The Lancet, 
a British medical journal, scientists say they have found a way to 
measure brain shrinkage before death, a method that could help 
diagnose the disease early.

	Brazil President Cardoso Sworn In  
</P>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Fernando Henrique Cardoso became  
Brazil's first re-elected president today, vowing to continue 
modernizing the economy while battling the country's deep social 
inequality. Cardoso was sworn in for his second four-year term in a 
ceremony in the capital, Brasilia. He is the first Brazilian 
president to take advantage of a 1997 constitutional change 
allowing the head of state to serve a second term.

	Labor Party Planned in China  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Weeks after China cracked down on a would-be  
opposition political party and imprisoned its leaders, dissidents 
are trying to form an independent labor party, an exiled activist 
says. Chinese leaders are extremely wary of any movement combining 
political opposition and labor activism, amid fears of unrest by 
the growing number of unemployed who have lost their jobs due to 
government economic reforms. Still, organizers of the new group, 
the China Labor Party, are preparing to register the group in 
Beijing.

<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Tom Brady, victimized twice by  
interceptions that led to Arkansas touchdowns, threw a 21-yard 
scoring pass to DiAllo Johnson with 2:25 to play today, sparking 
No. 15 Michigan to a 45-31 victory over No. 11 Arkansas in the 
Citrus Bowl. Arkansas (9-3), trailing 24-17 in the third quarter, 
scored two touchdowns after intercepting Brady's passes to lead 
31-24 early in the fourth.

<HEADLINE> Eyeing 2000, Americans Bring in `99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	From Times Square to the Space Needle, hundreds of thousands of  
people celebrated amid pyrotechnics, balloons and confetti as they 
ushered in the new year with an eye toward the real party 365 days 
from now. 
</P>
<P>
	In short, a party like it's 1999.  
</P>
<P>
	Bundled in layers and wrapped in blankets, an estimated 500,000  
people jammed Times Square in 20-degree weather that felt more like 
zero in the wind chill. 
</P>
<P>
	Three ... two ... one ... Happy New Year!  
</P>
<P>
	``It's beautiful, Moet &AMP; Chandon, New York, fireworks. ... I  
love it,'' said Opher Heyman, 24, of Miami as he tipped a plastic 
glass of champagne toward a flashing 1999 sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most awesome thing I've ever seen,'' Shari Rossoy  
of St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	At the stroke of midnight, more than 15,000 balloons showered  
the crowd and fireworks and 42 spotlights -- including the ``50K 
Space Cannon'' -- illuminated the sky. The light cannon is said to 
be visible from Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Chinese gymnast Sang Lan, paralyzed  
in a fall at last summer's Goodwill Games, pressed the button that 
sent the New Year's Eve ball on its last, slow descent at One Times 
Square. It will be replaced by a Waterford Crystal ball for New 
Year's Eve 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Midnight meant fireworks at Seattle's Space Needle. And in  
Boston, with a cacophony and burst of color to rival any Mardi 
Gras, a parade of costumed monsters and the planets of the solar 
system kicked off the city's First Night festivities, culminating 
in midnight fireworks over Boston Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't exactly Times Square, but about 5,000 people gathered  
in the Lake Erie resort city of Port Clinton, Ohio, to welcome 1999 
with a salute to the town's biggest industry -- sport fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd braved the 15-degree weather to watch a large  
Fiberglas walleye lowered from a crane. 
</P>
<P>
	In Las Vegas, an estimated 250,000 to 400,000 lined the Strip as  
the clock struck midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Local resident Matt Berry, 25, opted for a subdued celebration.  
</P>
<P>
	``The past two years we would go with the crowd, but that was  
just too tiring,'' said Berry as he sat in a lawn chair, wrapped in 
a blanket. ``This year we're just people watching. Next year we may 
go to Pasadena because we think they'll have trouble controlling 
the crowds here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In State Line, Nev., at Lake Tahoe, some revelers got a little  
too rowdy, as police arrested more 160 people at a street party. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's typical New Year's craziness, bizarreness,'' said Leona  
Allen, a police dispatcher in nearby South Lake Tahoe, Calif. 
``It's just one major orgy and it gets really, really ugly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A celebration was canceled in New Orleans after fireworks being  
loaded onto a barge exploded minutes before the craft was to be 
towed into the Mississippi River for a New Year's Eve display. Two 
fireworks technicians were killed and a sheriff's deputy was 
severely burned. 
</P>
<P>
	For many organizers, this year's celebrations served as a  
run-through for the next New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	In Las Vegas, authorities say as many as 700,000 people will  
welcome in the new millennium on the Strip next December. Police 
used Thursday night to gauge how well they might be able to control 
next year's crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're expecting next year to be very large,'' said Steve  
Meriwether, a Las Vegas police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers of the Times Square bash tested some of the special  
effects planned for next time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We only get one chance to try this out live,'' said Jeffrey  
Strauss, president of Countdown Entertainment, a marketing company 
that represents the ball and the building on which it sits. 
</P>
<P>
	South of the square, the Coney Island Arctic Ice Bears  
celebrated the New Year with their traditional dip in the Hudson 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very healthy,'' said Michael Polishchuk, 57, a club  
member who plunged into the chilly water. ``After, you feel like a 
newborn baby, the skin becomes pink, it's very good for the 
blood.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Central Bank Probed Over Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo tax authorities have quietly begun  
investigating Japan's central bank on suspicions top officials 
evaded income taxes, a newspaper said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents from the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau are looking for  
evidence that Bank of Japan officials neglected to pay taxes on 
such perks as company-subsidized mansions and country club 
memberships, the Asahi newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the bank and tax bureau could not be reached for  
comment due to the New Year's holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	A tax audit of the central bank of a major industrial nation is  
unprecedented, the report said. It further tarnishes the bank's 
reputation, which was blemished last year by the arrest of an 
official on charges of leaking information in exchange for lavish 
entertainment.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: End Destructive Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) -- President Clinton opened 1999  
with a note of optimism and a midnight kiss for his wife. He called 
on Washington to ``move away from the politics of personal 
destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No overt reminder of his political peril darkened the dawn of  
the new year for Clinton, even as the Senate is poised to weigh 
articles of impeachment against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking some two dozen questions on New Year's Eve -- first in a  
dialogue with teens and 20-somethings at the Renaissance Weekend 
intellectual retreat, then in written submissions from their 
parents -- Clinton did not receive a single query on the House votes 
to impeach him or a possible Senate trial to remove him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The president himself came closer than any questioners to  
addressing those issues stemming from his actions in the Monica 
Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, asked about the Republicans' 1994 ``Contract With  
America,'' sounded almost wistful for the days when issues divided 
the political parties. The aggressive GOP legislative agenda may 
have won Republicans House control in 1994, but the public backlash 
two years later got him re-elected, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wanted Democrats and Republicans in Washington to get  
back to a vigorous debate of issues such as Social Security reform 
and ``move away from the politics of personal destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's off-the-cuff comments in the two private,  
invitation-only sessions were relayed to reporters by White House 
spokeswoman Amy Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the youngsters asked Clinton, at the uncertain midpoint  
of his second term, what he had learned about life. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he's more optimistic than when he took office in 1993  
about the capacity of the American people to make changes and the 
ability of the government to help people improve their lives,'' 
Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton answered many of the same  
questions put to her husband. Asked how she wanted to be remembered 
by history, Mrs. Clinton referred to earlier in the evening when 
the emcee jokingly wondered how the heck a Wellesley grad ever 
landed in Vogue magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to worry about a legacy, I've been on the cover  
of Vogue,'' Mrs. Clinton laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelsea Clinton, on a holiday break from her sophomore year at  
Stanford University, accompanied her parents on the 48-hour retreat 
to this resort island. 
</P>
<P>
	The president made an early-morning tee time New Year's Day, and  
watched his beloved Arkansas Razorbacks fall 45-to-31 to Michigan 
in the Florida Citrus Bowl. He planned to fly back to Washington 
and return to the White House late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He would use his weekly radio address Saturday to paint a broad  
outline of his new budget plans, Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranging widely in Thursday night's discussion, Clinton decried  
the ability of extremists to plague the Middle East peace process, 
endorsed offering foreign languages to students as early as 
elementary school, touted his administration's accomplishments and 
said young people should be encouraged to go into teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	On reforming Social Security, he said he either will offer a  
specific plan or encourage the House and Senate to agree on a 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The countdown to midnight ended the organized talk. The Clintons  
shared a kiss and joined in singing ``Auld Lang Syne,'' Weiss said.
