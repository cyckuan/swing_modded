<HEADLINE> Kazakh President: NATO's Eastward Expansion Irreversible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- NATO's oft-stated eastward
expansion is irreversible and it is Kazakhstan's consistent policy
to strengthen its ties with the Western military body, Kazakh
President Nursultan Nazarbayev said today.
</P>
<P>
NATO's eastward expansion will not threaten Kazakhstan's
security but the military alliance has to take Russian interest
into consideration, said Nazarbayev while meeting NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana, who arrived here on a one-day
visit, the first leg of his tour of four Central Asia countries.
</P>
<P>
Solana said his tour of Central Asia aims to enhance mutual
understanding and cooperation between NATO and Central Asian
countries, particularly in the framework of "the Partnership for
Peace," a NATO program for military cooperation with East European
countries.
</P>
<P>
About 27 countries across Europe have signed up to the program,
which was initiated in 1994 to fill a vaccum following the
disintegration of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the NATO chief met with other senior Kazakh
officials to discuss regional and international issues, including
future cooperation between NATO and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Both sides said the Kazakh-NATO cooperation is of great
significance and will benefit stability and security in the
Central Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan has attended many NATO seminars since it joined
NATO's Partnership for Peace in 1994 while NATO officials visited
the republic of former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The NATO secretary-general will leave here today for Kyrgyzstan
to continue his tour, which will take him to Uzbekistan and
Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
It is the first visit to Central Asia by a NATO chief since
1992 when former NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner visited
the region.

<P>
PARIS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- France's top figure skater Philippe
Candeloro on Tuesday withdrew from this month's World Figure
Skating Championships in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
His coach Andre Brunet said last week that Candeloro, who
injured his ankle in February, did not want to go to the
tournament because he was not fit.
</P>
<P>
Brunet said Candeloro thought "it is not worth going to
Lausanne only to finish tenth or 15th."

<HEADLINE> Aidid's Factional Militia Seizes Village in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- at least three people were
killed and six others wounded when armed militiamen supporting
Hussein Mohamed Aidid clashed with those backing General Mohamed
Said Morgan at Gobwein village near Kismayu on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the VHF radio today, the fighting
followed after Marehan militiamen crossed over and handed their
defense positions to junior Aidid's faction last week.
</P>
<P>
The positions include the strategic village of Gobwein, 10
kilometers north of the southern port of Kismayu, the third
largest town in the country.
</P>
<P>
The defection of Marehan (one name), clansman of Somalia's
late dictator Siad Barre, has created an internal split within
the supporters of General Morgan who is now outside Somalia.
</P>
<P>
As the situation in the town became tense, the militiamen of
Majerten and Dhulbahante are making preparations for a
counterattack against the newly allied forces of Hussein Aidid
and Marehan clansmen outside the town.
</P>
<P>
Hence fighting broke out at the village.
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether the allied forces will further advance
toward Kismayu which fell to General Morgan in February 1991.
Hussein Aidid's men had lost Gobwein village to General Morgan in
December 1995.
</P>
<P>
There has been no word from either side over the fighting.
However, radio South Mogadishu supporting Hussein Aidid spoke
about a visit to the village by the sports minister of Aidid's
self-styled government who himself comes from Marehan clan. This
confirmed the fall of the village to Aidid.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Govt to Discuss Lesotho Policemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Government officials are to
discuss the asylum applications of two Lesotho policemen who fled
to South Africa after a police mutiny was put down in the kingdom
last month, said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Department of Home Affairs Hennie Meyer said
representatives from his department, the Departments of Foreign
Affairs and Justice, and the U.N. High Commission for Refugees
are expected to attend the talks, scheduled to be held in
Pretoria later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Meyer said the planned talks were aimed at determining whether
the situation, under which about 400 rebel policemen seized
control of the Police Headquarters in Maseru for about 10 days,
justified an asylum application.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant Phakiso Molise, alleged to be the leader of the
police mutiny, and his fellow policeman Sergeant Motlatsi
Makapeng, disappeared from his hiding out in the Maseru Palace of
King Letsie III shortly after the military crack-down and holed
up later in Pretoria for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs spokesman Marco Boni said the Lesotho
government last week asked the South African government to
extradite the two rebel policemen to Lesotho to face murder
charges.
</P>
<P>
Boni said, however, the officials would discuss both the
asylum applications and extradition before making a final
decision at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho Foreign Affairs Minister Kelebone Maope said on Monday
that Molise should come back and "face the music for his alleged
involvement in the reported murders and the mutiny".
</P>
<P>
Maope said a delegation had been sent to Pretoria to request
that Molise and Makapeng be sent back to Lesotho to face charges.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny started on February 6 when a group of Lesotho
policemen came out in support of Molise and seven other junior
police officers who took over police headquarters in Maseru and
refused to be arrested on charges of murder, attempted murder and
kidnapping.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Starts Proximity Talks in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel today
held a meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides as part of
proximity talks aimed to achieve direct negotiations between the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after an hour-long meeting with the Cypriot
president, Feissel said "we are getting on to a good start." He
noted that the "purpose of these talks is to open the way to
face-to-face negotiations in the coming few months."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that during the proximity talks, the U.N. will
probe the flexibility of each leader to make his contribution
towards overcoming the differences that remain in the key issues
related to an overall settlement.
</P>
<P>
Refraining from giving further details concerning the proximity
talks between the U.N., and Cyprus President Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, Feissel said both of them agreed not
to comment on the substantive aspects of these talks.
</P>
<P>
Feissel noted that the two leaders have realised that time is
marching on and "Cyprus is approaching a defining moment in its
problem and that whether they will succeed or fail in this
exercise will be very important for the future of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official revealed that he will have meetings with
President Clerides and Denktash twice a week.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday and Friday he will be meeting President Clerides
and on Tuesday and Thursday with Denktash.
</P>
<P>
"What we are embarking now is very intensive discussions with
each leader so that we can move to these direct talks between
the two sides in the next few months," Feissel said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Feissel started a new round of proximity
talks Monday in which he first had a meeting with Denktash. The
details of the meeting were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
U.N. senior advisor Peter Schmits said Monday that the
U.N. will try to divert the media spotlight away from the talks.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want too much media attention on the talks. We will
be tight-lipped about them," the U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
The start of the proximity talks was announced here by
government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The talks are aimed to reach common ground on the Cyprus
problem which could pave the way for direct talks between
President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took control of the northern third of the island in
the wake of a short-lived coup seeking union with Greece. The
Cyprus problem has remained unsolved despite the U.N. and
international community's peace efforts for the past 23 years.

<HEADLINE> Coal Miners Continue Blocking Bonn Government District </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Western German coal miners continued
their blockade of the government district here today after
negotiations between government and trade union representatives on
mining subsidy cuts were postponed to Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations cannot be held in an atmosphere with "elements
of blackmail", said Friedrich Bohl, chief of the chancellor's
office.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was due to meet today with Hans
Berger, leader of IG Bergbau trade union.
</P>
<P>
The protest began early Monday with miners surrounding the
headquarters of parties, leading to traffic chaos in Bonn. The
authorities have said they will allow the protest to continue
which is blocking the city's main north-south artery.
</P>
<P>
Up to 20,000 miners are expected to joint the Bonn
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
The government is planning to reduce annual federal subsidies
for western Germany's bituminous coal mines from 10 billion marks
(5.8 billion U.S. dollars) currently to 5.5 billion marks (3.2
billion U.S. dollars) by 2005, with some 4 billion marks to be
paid by it and the rest from North Rhine-Westphalia state.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the unprofitable deep-pit coal mines in the west of
Germany received a record 11.2 billion marks (about 6.6 billion
U.S. dollars) in federal and state handouts, it is reported.
</P>
<P>
German bituminous coal costs 280 marks per ton, compared with
80 marks per ton for such coal purchased on world markets.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions believe the quick pace of subsidy reduction will
result in mass unemployment in the coal mining regions of the Ruhr
Valley and Saarland, pushing up unemployment in the country, which
hit a record of 4.67 million, or 12.2 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Under the government plan only around 35,000 jobs in mines
would remain by 2005 out of a total of about 85,000 currently.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions are demanding 6.5 billion marks (about 3.8 billion
U.S. dollars) in annual subsidies from 2005 and say they are
willing to reduce the coal mining workforce to 45,000.

<HEADLINE> Iran Fires 150 Customs Staff on Corruption Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Customs authorities
announced here today that 150 staff members were fired on charges
of corruption last year.
</P>
<P>
Abdulhussein Vahhaji, head of Iran's Customs, said that more
corruption cases are under investigation, some of them are very
serious.
</P>
<P>
Among the 150 fired were people with 29 years of service in
the Customs, he said in a report carried in today's evening
Persian newspaper Kayhan.
</P>
<P>
However, the official did not go into detail about the cases
in the report.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report, three custom officials who
received a total of 10 million U.S. dollars in bribes from carpet
dealers have stood on trial in the capital of Tehran this month.
</P>
<P>
Prosecuting Attorney Ali Qassemi considered Mahmoud Zhaleh,
Samad Eftekhari Rad and Abdorrahim Mo'alem as "Corrupter on
Earth" for having inflicted heavy casualties on Iran's
traditional carpet industry.
</P>
<P>
"Corrupter on Earth" is a term used in Iranian trials after
the Islamic revolution in 1979. Those whose financial dealings or
moral conduct are against Islamic values are designated with this
term. If a court finds a person as "Corrupter on Earth", he will
be facing death by hanging or execution.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities have recently stepped up their fight
against rampant corruption at different government bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Customs has a bad reputation of being one of the
most corrupt departments with Mafia-like teams and clans in the
Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
Vahhaji said that the move to clear up the Iranian Customs
came in January 1996 by setting up special teams to deal with the
corruption cases.

<HEADLINE> Ulimo-K Faction Linked With Rebels in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The arrest by the West African
Peace-keeping Forces in Liberia of Ulimo-K leader Alhaji Kromah
on arms concealment charges has triggered reports that the
faction may have buried arms in border towns in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Security officials here said Monday they are ''studying the
possibility'' but editor of the biweekly Expo Times Seega Shaw
said his paper had evidence of gun-running and arms concealment.
</P>
<P>
On March 1 and 5, the Expo Times claimed the Ulimo-K ''is
helping the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone ''to
regroup and launch fresh attacks on government positions.''
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a rebel escapee, Manawa Fomba caught by
government troops near Bo a week ago as saying that Alhaji Kromah
''offered 240 Ulimo fighters and a large consignment of arms
including G3 weapons to the RUF.''
</P>
<P>
The March 1 copy of the paper also alleged that ''a large
quantity of arms belonging to Ulimo-K were transported from
Lteria to Buedun, a border town in eastern Sierra Leone two weeks
before the arms surrender deadline for safe keeping by the RUF.''
</P>
<P>
West African diplomats here said Kromah ''also has strong
links with the civilian government of President Tejan Kabbah
which supplied Ulimo with arms to help fight rebels in Sierra
Leone at the height of the civil war.''
</P>
<P>
Correspondents also said that 2,000 RUF combatants surrendered
to Ulimo fighters in late January after crossing the border into
areas controlled by Kromah in Liberia. The surrendered rebels
later declined Kabbah's plea to return to Sierra Leone under an
amnesty.

<HEADLINE> US Productivity Advances by 0.7 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. productivity gained
by 0.7 percent last year, a modest but the biggest increase in
four years, the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The increase was revised down from the rise of 0.8 percent
announced one month ago.
</P>
<P>
Productivity measures output per hour of work and is the key
measurement of how fast living standards can rise in the country.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that increase of U.S. productivity is more
than double the 0.3 percent advance in 1995 but far below the
rapid advance in living standards recorded in the decades after
World War II.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the productivity grew at a 1.1 percent annual
rate in the fourth quarter, only half the 2.2 percent figure it
reported originally.
</P>
<P>
That occurred because hours worked increased more than thought
and output increased less.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a more modest fourth-quarter productivity gain,
the result was a steeper rise in unit labor costs, which take
account of both hourly wages and productivity. They rose at a 2.5
percent annual rate in the quarter compared with the milder 1.4
percent rise originally reported.
</P>
<P>
But the gain of 2.9 percent in labor cost in 1996 was the same
as 1995.
</P>
<P>
With unemployment near a seven-year low -- 5.3 percent in
February -- U.S. economists expect wage pressures will cause unit
labor costs to rise more steeply this year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, World Bank Hold Consultations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A two-day annual consultations
between the Zimbabwe government and the World Bank started here
today, in a bid to push up the country's second phase of economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, senior official of the Zimbabwean Finance
Ministry Stanley Mahlahla said there is still a long way to go
before the economic liberalization process is completed.
</P>
<P>
He said among other areas which the government needed to work
on were civil service reform and further deregulation of the
agro-based economy.
</P>
<P>
The government was committed to further reduction of the
bloated budget deficit, he said, which was expected to exceed 11
percent of gross domestic product in the year to June 1997, a far
cry from the original target of five percent when the reform
effort was launched in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which end on Wednesday, will review various
development projects which the bank might support, ranging from
rural roads and health programs, to the second phase of market
reforms to be launched this year under the title, the Zimbabwe
program for Economic and Social Transformation (ZIMPREST).
</P>
<P>
At the same occasion, resident representative in Zimbabwe of
the World Bank David Cook said the progress made in preparing
ZIMPREST was ''an important and useful step forward''.
</P>
<P>
''All of us feel strongly that consultations are an important
factor in making this program successful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Cook also said progress made on parastatal reform was
encouraging, especially in the posts and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The bank, in remarks prepared ahead of the talks, warned that
the war against poverty and rampant unemployment as well as the
need to restore macro-economic stability through fiscal
discipline and reduction of the government role in running the
economy were far from over.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which gave more than 300 million U.S. Dollars in
balance-of-payments support for the first phase of market reforms
which officially ended in 1995, said it would consider funding
other projects ranging from support to the agricultural and
health sectors, to rehabilitation of rural roads.

<HEADLINE> WEU Conference Opens in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A Western European Union (WEU)
conference attended by parliamentarians from member states started
here today to discuss the union's relations with NATO and the
future of the organization in view of the enlargement of both the
European Union and the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Opening the conference, which is due to finish on Thursday,
President of the WEU Parliamentary Assembly Luis Maria De Puig
said that "the WEU is co-responsible for issues which relate to
the expansion of the alliance or the European Union."
</P>
<P>
Donald Macconnell, Assistant to NATO's Secretary-General
responsible for political matters, told the conference that NATO
played an important role in the making of a new "peaceful,
undivided and free" Europe.
</P>
<P>
Macconnell also said the term NATO enlargement was misleading
"because it implies that NATO is moving towards the east while in
reality the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are moving
towards the west."
</P>
<P>
Conference sources said that alliance officials were annoyed at
the fact that the WEU had proceeded with the organization of the
Athens conference and at its assumption of important activities.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the participants, Speaker of the Greek parliament
Apostolos Kaklamanis reiterated a Greek proposal for the signing
of a protocol agreement committing NATO member-states not just
against aggression by a third party but also by allies.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that he did not perceive a NATO enlargement as the
way to solve the differences between the alliance's member-states,
Kaklamanis said a cure for these differences should precede or at
least be promoted in parallel to enlargement procedures especially
since these differences concern basic principles of international
law which "the alliance has so far failed to implement on every
occasion."
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos and other senior
officials are expected to address the conference.

<HEADLINE> German Hostages Freed Without Ransom in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The seven German tourists kidnapped
in Yemen a week ago were released without payment of any ransom to
kidnappers thanks to the efforts by the Yemeni government, German
Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the gang of kidnappers, consisting of
about 30 people, demanded a ransom of 12 million U.S. dollars but
gave it up in subsequent negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Erdmann said the seven people were well and would be taken to
the Yemeni capital of Sanaa by helicopter later in the day.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel thanked the Yemeni
government for its efforts, particularly praising President Ali
Abdallah Saleh and Foreign Minister Abdulkarim Al-Iryanai for
their personal efforts to secure the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The German hostages, aged between 30 and 45, were in Yemen on a
motorcycling holiday when they were seized by the gang near the
border with Oman last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, a total of 80 foreigners have been
abducted in Yemen by members of rival clans, to extort ransom,
among other demands, from the government. In these cases, all the
hostages were freed unharmed.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Warn of Overfishing in North Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Scientists are sounding the
alarm that the reserves of cod, herring and mackerel in the North
Sea are diminishing drastically due to overfishing, according to
reports from Oslo.
</P>
<P>
Because of ruthless overfishing in the sea for years, the
reserves of cod have sunk to 60,000 tons from 275,000 tons in
1970; those of mackerel have dropped from 700,000 tons in 1975 to
80,000-85,000 tons and those of herring downed from 1.5 million
tons in 1989 to 400,000 tons at present.
</P>
<P>
At the fourth North Sea Conference held at Esbjerg in Denmark
in 1995, the environmental ministers of the North Sea countries
agreed to take strong measures against overfishing, which they
described as an ecological catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
Although the North Sea countries have been fully aware of the
catastrophe, little has been done to solve the issue.
</P>
<P>
Denmark, Norway and Britain are the countries that fish most in
the North Sea, accounting for 45 percent, 22 percent and 12
percent of the total fish catch, respectively.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Dialog and Cooperation to Promote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China called here today on
developed countries to return to the right course of dialog and
cooperation in order to promote human rights in the world.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the ongoing fifty-third session of the United
Nations Commission on Human Rights, Head of the Chinese Delegation
Wu Jianmin said, "By politicizing the issue of human rights,
practising double-standard and opting for confrontation, the
developed countries have not only run counter to the founding
purpose of the Commission, but also trampled on the UN Charter."
</P>
<P>
Wu condemned developed countries's "willful name-calling of
developing countries in their statements". The way the self-styled
judges of the developed countries have done is itself a serious
violation of the principle of democracy.
</P>
<P>
"China is the largest developing country. It is one of the
major targets as well as a prime victim of name-calling of some
Western countries. Yet for the sake of promoting international
human rights, we still call for cooperation, and hope to avoid
confrontation," Wu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu stressed, "If some developed countries choose to
impose confrontation on us and continue name-calling against
China, we will have no alternative but to keep the company."
</P>
<P>
On March 19 last year, Wu recalled, representatives from 11
developing countries called for cooperation and against
confrontation. "However, representatives of some developed
countries turned a deaf ear to this just appeal and stubbornly
clung to confrontation," Wu regretted. This year, a group of
developing countries have again tabled a draft resolution calling
for cooperation and consensus.

WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left Israel for a
two-day visit to Russia. He left behind crises that included the
Palestinians' unexpected refusal to accept Israel's offer to
withdraw from an additional 9.1 percent of the West Bank and an
effort in Parliament to lower the number of votes needed to
dismiss a prime minister.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton met with President Hosni Mubarak
of Egypt in Washington. At a news conference, Clinton defended the
American veto of a United Nations Security Council resolution that
condemned Israel's plan to build Jewish housing in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- As rebels prepare to assault the northeast city of
Kisangani, Zairians and foreign diplomats said that military and
political power is continuing to slip away from the government of
President Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
-- Nationwide Insurance, one of the country's largest providers
of homeowner policies, said Monday it would invest 13 million
U.S. dollars in inner-city neighborhoods as part of an agreement
with the Justice Department to resolve claims that the company
systematically discriminated against low-income minority
communities.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- A U.S.-Germany spy flap raises questions about Washington's
apparent turn to economic espionage. The case, in which a U.S.
diplomat sought data from Germany's Economic Ministry, is the
third in the past two years. Analysts say using spy agencies to
advance an economic agenda can lead to a variety of problems.

<P>
HARARE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Flue-cured tobacco exports last
year earned Zimbabwe 618 million U.S. Dollars, making it the
single largest foreign currency earner.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA) said today the export
value in real terms had gone up by 211 million Dollars, an
increase of 46 percent on the 1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe Dollar terms, the value of last year's exports
increased by 72 percent from four billion Zimbabwe Dollars (363
million US Dollars) earned in 1995.
</P>
<P>
''The unit price rose 50 percent from 2.12 US Dollars/kg to
3.20 US Dollars/kg,'' the ZTA said.
</P>
<P>
''Larger shipments to Germany, the rest of Africa and the
United States accounted for much of the increase,'' said the ZTA.
</P>
<P>
It said, ''the European Union remains the most important
destination for Zimbabwe tobacco, taking 41 percent of total
shipments, followed by the Far East at 21 percent.''

<HEADLINE> Greek Defense, Foreign Officials Meet on Albania Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Top officials from Greek defense
and foreign ministries met today to discuss the latest development
in neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
Jointly chaired by the country's Defense Minister Akis
Thohatzopoulos and Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, the
meeting discussed the deteriorating situation in Albania and the
possible consequences of the development.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources, the participants concluded that
the uncertainty in that country was being exacerbated by the
inability of the regime of President Sali Berisha to control
developments in south.
</P>
<P>
The same sources said the possibility of an outbreak of full-
scale civil war was also discussed, as the insurgency appeared to
be spreading to the north of the country and Berisha was arming
citizens and pro-government soldiers in order to give himself more
leverage in negotiations with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government meanwhile is to continue its diplomatic
activity in an attempt to defuse the crisis. Government sources
say a multinational force could be deployed in future in order to
guarantee the negotiations, although there has been no indication
as yet from NATO Secretary General Javier Solana that such a move
is being considered.
</P>
<P>
It was also denied that Italy had asked for Greece to be
excluded from any international force because of its position as a
neighboring country.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR to Hold Meeting on Refugee Displacement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is to hold a meeting on March
12-13 in Amman, Jordan, with 14 countries to discuss a
comprehensive approach to the mass movements in central, southwest
Asia and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus on the problems of people who have been
forced from their homes by wars and civil conflicts and the
challenges the displacement presents to UNHCR and the affected
countries, according to a press release issued here today by
Geneva-based UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
A process leading to a solution to the mass displacement is
expected to be initiated in the discussions, which will be
presided over by High Commissioner Ms Sadako Ogata and Jordanian
Crown Prince El Hassan Bin Talal.
</P>
<P>
There are some 4.5 million refugees and internally displaced
persons in the region, apart from the Palestinians who fall under
the mandate of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for
Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).
</P>
<P>
The major refugee groups are the 3 million Afghans in Iran and
Pakistan and 580,000 Iraqis in neighboring countries, says UNHCR.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Accused of Having Several Thousand Armed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Angolan government
official today accused the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) of retaining several thousand
armed fighters even the majority have gone to assembly camps.
</P>
<P>
Joao Lourenco, leader of MPLA parliamentary group and its
Secretary of Information, told reporters of the Angolan News
Agency in Lisbon that these fighters are used to guard UNITA
President Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
"It is beyond belief that a leader of a political party needs
so many armed guards to defend him," Lourenco, who is on a visit
to Portugal, complained.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed however that the top leaders of the ruling MPLA
party and UNITA will meet before the swearing-in ceremony of the
government of national unity and reconciliation as the two sides
have made enough progress on the political role of Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Lourenco said his party agrees with UNITA's request for
constitution amendment on the condition that MPs should discuss
the matter in parliament.

<HEADLINE> Institute: 2.5 Percent Growth for Germany's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A leading economic institute in
Germany today forecast an economic growth of 2.5 percent this year
and 3.0 percent in 1998 in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Hamburg World Economic Research institute (HWWA), one of
Germany's six independent economic research bodies, added that
however unemployment would not improve much and be likely to stay
above the four million mark.
</P>
<P>
The government aim to cut unemployment by 50 percent by the
year 2000 is not attainable, it said. Unemployment in Germany hit
a post-war record high of 4.67 million in February.
</P>
<P>
The 2.5 percent growth forecast for 1997 agrees with that by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government. The outlook by some other
institutes and experts is however rather pessimistic, and is
supported by the zero growth of Germany's Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) in the last quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
HWWA said however making predictions about the economy beyond
1997 is precarious, partly because the government's tax reforms
have not yet been put in place.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government's efforts for membership of the
European single currency, the Euro, are affecting such elements as
interest rates and exchanged rates.
</P>
<P>
The institute also believes that Bonn will fail to meet the
criteria set for joining the Euro that limits budget deficit to 3
percent of GDP, with its deficit in 1997 foreseen at 3,25 percent
of GDP.

HARARE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of Zimbabwe's
Commercial Cattle Producers Association Paul d'Hotman today said
the country needs 16.4 million U.S. Dollars to finance the herd
rebuilding program.
</P>
<P>
He said his association now wants to look at ways of raising
the required funding, preferably at reasonable interest rates of
not more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The breeding herd has fallen from a high of over 625,000 to
less than 450,000, mainly due to two droughts in the last five
years and de-stocking as farmers sold cattle to raise funds to

<HEADLINE> Primary School League Tables Published in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Performance tables covering 14,500
primary schools in England have been published today for the first
time since 1945.
</P>
<P>
"The remarkable success of five years of secondary school
performance tables has confirmed what we always knew to be true -
the publication of tables drives up standards, " Mrs Gillian
Shephard, the Education and Employment Secretary said.
</P>
<P>
"The give parents clear information about schools which are
doing will and about those which are doing badly. They make
schools and local authorities accountable for what they are doing.
Primary tables will do the same."
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the performance of virtually all primary
schools in England, as measured by last Summer's national
curriculum tests for 11-year-olds in English, maths and science,
could be compared.
</P>
<P>
In only 11 schools did all pupils reach the level in all three
subjects that the British Government says represents the
achievement expected of a "typical" 11-year-old. Only one in 10
were the expected levels reached by at least 75 percent of pupils.
</P>
<P>
"The publication of these tables marks another step in the
information revolution which is transforming education. The
Government has made it clear that the next step will be to extend
the tables to include the performance of seven and fourteen year
olds," Mrs Shephard said.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Postpones Talks on Coal Mining Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
postponed the scheduled talks today with trade union leader to
Thursday as Western German coal miners continued their blockade of
the government district here in protest of plans to slash federal
subsidies to coal mining.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations cannot be held in an atmosphere with "elements
of blackmail", said Friedrich Bohl, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
chief-of-staff. Kohl had been due to meet today with Hans Berger,
leader of IG Bergbau trade union.
</P>
<P>
"I will not let myself be put under pressure," Kohl was quoted
as saying by German news agency DPA. "Today it is this, tomorrow
perhaps it is the farmers and the day after come the construction
workers -- I must warn against this."
</P>
<P>
The protest began early Monday, with miners surrounding the
headquarters of parties, leading to traffic chaos in Bonn. The
authorities have said they will allow the protest to continue
which is blocking the city's main north-south artery.
</P>
<P>
Berger said it was a "provocation" for Kohl to postpone the
talks, but he called on the protesters, estimated at 15,000 by
police, to break off their blockade from Wednesday morning and
await results of the Thursday talks.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's government is planning to reduce annual federal
subsidies for Western Germany's bituminous coal mines from 10
billion marks currently to 5.5 billion marks (3.2 billion U.S.
dollars) by 2005, with some 4 billion marks to be paid by it and
the rest from North Rhine-Westphalia state.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the unprofitable deep-pit coal mines in the West of
Germany received a record 11.2 billion marks in federal and state
handouts, it is reported.
</P>
<P>
German bituminous coal costs 280 marks per ton, compared with
80 marks per ton for such coal purchased on world markets.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions believe the quick pace of subsidy reduction will
result in mass unemployment in the coal mining regions of the Ruhr
Valley and Saarland, pushing up unemployment in the country, which
hit a record of 4.67 million, or 12.2 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Under the government plan only around 35,000 jobs in mines
would remain by 2005 out of a total of about 85,000 currently.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions are demanding 6.5 billion marks in annual
subsidies from 2005 and say they are willing to reduce the coal
mining workforce to 45,000.

AMMAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti said here today Jordan could not maintain normal
diplomatic relations with Israel if the Jewish state continued to
take unilateral and illegal measures on the Palestinians, Radio
Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian prime minister told the Lower House of Parliament
that the building of Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem was
illegal and all the signed agreements between the Palestinians and
Israelis should be respected by both sides.
</P>

After a lengthy debate, the Lower House of Parliament decided
to appoint a special committee to draft the legislature's position
towards Israeli government's Jewish settlement policy and the
U.S. veto of the U.N. Security Council resolution which condemned
Israel's settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1994 and established
diplomatic relations later. The two countries also realized
direct transport of goods through their common borders on January

<P>
NAIROBI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
committed to the development of small-scale enterprises to
provide more job opportunities to its growing population.
</P>
<P>
Opening a one-day workshop to foster policy research on
small-scale enterprises here today, Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti said that small-scale enterprises have played "a key role
in employment creation."
</P>
<P>
Saitoti, also the Minister for Planning and National
Development, noted that there are estimatedly 900,000 enterprises
which employ less than 10 people each in the eastern African
country.
</P>
<P>
He told the workshop sponsored by the International Center for
Economic Growth that 80 percent of the small-scale enterprises
are located in rural areas where most Kenyans live in.
</P>
<P>
He said that the sector is expected to create 39.4 percent of
the total jobs over the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls for Meeting with Foreign Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat has asked for a meeting with
foreign diplomats in an attempt to muster support in the latest
crisis with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has invited diplomats from the United States, Russia,
Japan, the European Union and Arab countries to this meeting to
discuss what he termed violations of peace agreements by Israel,
which have led to a deadlock in the peace process and increased
tension.
</P>
<P>
The latest tension is a result of Israel's recent decision on
the scope of further troop redeployments in the West Bank, its
plan to build a settlement in Har Homa in East Jerusalem and
its move to close four Palestinian offices in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials continued standing firm on these issues
today, saying that Israel would not back down from the
decisions. David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu, told Israel Radio that Israel would start
the construction in Har Homa within a week.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no backdown. It's expected that the work (in
Har Homa) will begin by next week," he said, adding that the exact
date could be Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian officials repeated the warning that the
Israeli moves could lead to violence that could derail the peace
process. Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat condemned
Israel for dictating the terms of the peace process and
humiliating the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
"We really don't have negotiations in full sense anymore, we
have an Israeli government that thinks it can come to us and
dictate to us, which is a humiliation to us," he told Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that during a meeting between Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy and chief Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud
Abbas (Abu Mazen) Sunday night, Levy rejected all suggestions put
forward by the Palestinian side on ways of breaking the
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Abbas offered resignation following the meeting to protest
against Israel's violations of peace accords.
</P>
<P>
According to Erekat, Abbas first suggested the formation of a
joint legal committee to ensure honest and accurate
implementation of peace agreements, then urged Israel to freeze
all unilateral moves, and at last proposed arbitration by the
countries sponsoring the peace process, but all were flatly
rejected by the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said the PNA was still doing the best to prevent
Palestinian violent reaction towards Israel's hardline moves, but
he warned that no one could predict what would happen if Israel
started work in Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
He reminded Israel of the September bloodshed which was caused
by Israel's opening of an underground archaeological tunnel in
East Jerusalem. Over 70 people were killed in the three-day
widespread clashes.
</P>
<P>
"This situation is very dangerous and very volatile. That's
why we ask the Israeli government to reverse its decision and
come back to the negotiating table," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Official: US Veto of Anti-Israeli Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi delegate to the Arab League
Nabil Negm said today that it is no surprise at all that the
U.S. should cast a veto against a draft U.N. resolution
condemning Israeli settlement plans in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. veto was expected, taking into consideration of the
recent stances adopted by the Clinton administration," Negm was
quoted as saying by the Egyptian MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
Such a position taken by Washington shows that all expectations
that the U.S will change its stance that pampers Israel's
continued violations of the signed agreements are far from
reality, Negm added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official also criticized Israel for its intransigent
position. "What has been done showed that it did not abandon its
true objectives," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Friday vetoed the European-sponsored U.N. Security
Council draft resolution that rejects Israel's decision to build
6,500 Jewish homes in East Jerusalem, though other 14 Council
members supported it.
</P>
<P>
Israel deems Jerusalem as its undivided capital while the
Palestinians want to set up the capital of a future state in
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, at a press conference jointly held
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Washington Monday,
defended the U.S. decision but said it did not constitute
U.S. approval of Israel's action.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that Jerusalem is a disputed land whose status
should be determined until the final talks due to start next
week. But he argued that the U.S. was put off by the wording of the
draft resolution which smells of precluding a settlement of
Jerusalem through final talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, together with other Arab countries, has expressed shock
over the U.S. decision and said it has given a seal of approval to
Israel's settlement plan.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was overpowered by the U.S.-led multinational troops after
invading neighboring Kuwait in 1990. It is still recovering from
over six-year-long U.N.-imposed sanctions, which was partially
lifted last December despite strong U.S. opposition.

<HEADLINE> EU Scales up Quota for Egyptian Cotton, Yarn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has earmarked a
quota of 73,692 tonnes of cotton cloth and yarn to Egypt this year,
a 3.5 percent rise over the 1996 quota, the sources of Egyptian
General Federation of Chambers of Commerce said today.
</P>
<P>
The figure breaks down to 19,251 tonnes for the cloth and 54,441
tonnes for the yarns, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
All Egyptian manufactured commodities enjoy full exemption of
customs duties in EU countries, except for the cotton material and
yarn which are subject to the quota system.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed
Goweili's five-nation European tour, launched to press for easier
access to EU markets for customs-exempted items such as rice,
potatoes, flowers and citrons.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements reached during the trip with France,
Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and Spain, Egypt will significantly
raise its agricultural export to these countries within the
framework of World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Export of potatoes will be more than tripled to 750,000 tonnes
while export of oranges rise more than three times the present
volume, reaching 300,000 tonnes. Rice will go up by 47 percent to
475,000 tonnes, and flowers by 50 percent to 3 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Egypt suffers an unbalanced trade exchange with the EU, tilting
in favor of EU countries by approximately 2.7 million ECUs,
according to Minister Commercial Plenipotentiary Alsharkawi Hefni
who chairs the Technical Bureau of the Trade Representation
Board.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel today successfully
carried out another test launch of its Arrow anti-missile
system, reported the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The Arrow intercepted and destroyed a target missile launched
in a naval ship somewhere off Israel's coast early this
afternoon, said the report.
</P>
<P>
This is the second successful test of Arrow 2. The last
test took place in August last year. The focus of the test
this time was not only to prove once more that the Arrow
could intercept a target missile, but also to examine full
integration of radar and control systems. An official of Israel
Aircraft Industries, which is in charge of the test, was
quoted as saying that today's test was a success for every
element involved.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, the Arrow system, as a
significant anti-missile defense for the country will be ready
by the end of the decade. The entire program, from initial
stage in late 1980s till full deployment in the year of 2005,
is expected to cost 1.7 billion U.S. dollars, part of which
is funded from a joint development program with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The Arrow is intended to provide an important defense
shield against intermediate-range ballistic missiles like Scud,
according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Palestinian Fury Mounting Over Israeli Settlement Policy (I) (by Hou Jia) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians, officials and
civilians alike, are increasingly furious over Israel's settlement
expansion and non-abidance by the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said today that the Middle East peace
process is in real jeopardy and about to explode.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the Palestinian Council Ahmed Korei, speaking to the
Voice of Arab radio, said the peace process is now put in real
danger due to Israel's settlement and Judaization policies.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government's attempts to wriggle out of its
commitment to the peace agreements signed previously with the
Palestinians would wreck the peace march, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli redeployment in the West Bank, Korei said this
process should take place in phases and redeployment operations in
90 percent of the West Bank should be finalized by the end of the
transitional phase.
</P>
<P>
The Arab rage has been mounting over the recent Israeli
decision to build 6,500 new Jewish homes and close four
Palestinian offices in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
And also, the Palestinians are disappointed over Israel's
promised pull-back from only 9 percent of the West Bank, instead
of 30 percent as the Palestinians had expected.
</P>
<P>
While expressing the hope that Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak's current U.S. visit would be a success to give a new
momentum to the peace process, the official said the Palestinians
welcome an effective European role in the peace process during the
coming stage.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. veto of a European-sponsored U.N. Security Council
draft resolution barring the Israeli settlement plan has dealt
another blow to the increasingly frustrated Palestinians. The veto
prompted "a feeling of injustice" and cast doubt about the
"credibility of U.S. as a fair mediator" in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The EU, which Israel and its biggest ally the U.S. had tried to
marginalize from the peace process, is gaining more political
weight, in addition to its status as the biggest donor to the
Palestinians.

<P>
In a related development, Nabil Abu Redina, Palestinian
Presidential Information Spokesman, also warned that
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in now in "a state of cul-de-sac."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian MENA news agency today quoted the Palestinian
official as saying that freezing the peace process by Israel will
push things to a point of no return. "Israel must freeze its
"arbitrary resolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said contacts still went on though the
negotiations were over, despite Israeli reports that
communications with the Palestinians broke down.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have so far refused to coordinate with Israel
on the transfer of authority, putting the withdrawal on hold.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian man in the street is virtually disappointed and
this disappointment may bring about grave consequences," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Strain, tension and dissatisfaction prevailing the Palestinian
street will turn into endless problems if Israelis started work at
their projected Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem, he said.
</P>
<P>
The tension of the past two weeks probably portends what
similar to the daily clashes between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian bottle and stone throwers in the West Bank,
reminiscent of the 1987-1993 Intifada (uprisings) against Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli guard at a Jewish settlement in the West Bank today
was stabbed and seriously wounded, and consequently, two
Palestinian suspects were arrested.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Palestinian Information Minister Yasser
Abed-Rabbo Monday evening, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai made clear that Israel would not back down from its
recent decisions.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians today called for U.S. and Arab intervention in
the peace process. Arafat would invite diplomats from the U.S.,
Russia, Japan, European countries and the Arab world to Gaza this
weekend to discuss the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources disclosed Monday that Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat seemed so pessimistic about
talks with Israel that he is thinking of leaving the self-rule
Gaza Strip and moving the PLO operations to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said Monday he felt deceived. "There is a real crisis
because there is a real breaching of what has been agreed upon, a
trick and the conspiracy against the peace process, against the
agreement which has been signed."
</P>
<P>
In an outrage over Israel's limited withdrawal plan, seven
Palestinian cabinet ministers have said they might step down,
according to the CNN reports.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Former Faction Leader to Be Prosecuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's presidential candidate
and ex-warlord Alhaji Kromah will be prosecuted later this week
on charge of hiding a large quantity of arms, reports reaching
here said.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted sources from the Liberian Justice Ministry
as saying that Kromah will appear before a magistrate to answer
accusations of illegally stashing arms against him.
</P>
<P>
Kromah has been under house arrest by the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG since Friday when armed
peacekeepers raided his house in Monrovia in the early morning
and discovered four truck-loads of arms and ammunitions there.
</P>
<P>
He was moved into police custody late Monday, after the
ECOMOG had completed its investigation, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Kromah, the former leader of the Mandingo wing of the United
Liberation Movement, resigned last month from the Ruling Council
of State so that he can run for the Liberian presidency.
</P>
<P>
He had been regarded as one of the three most hopeful presidential
candidates in the May 30 elections. The other two are Charles Taylor
of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia and Goerge Boley of the
Peace Council of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers representing 79 bodyguards arrested with Kromah have
claimed that their clients were being denied access to legal
counsel, relations and food, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Justice Minister Peter Jallah, the lawyers said
that the superintendent of the Monrovia prison "is frustrating
all our efforts to meet our clients to get adequate information
about their charges."
</P>
<P>
The reports also quoted ECOMOG's Commander Major-General
Victor Malu as saying on Monday that the peacekeepers have taken
"adequated measures to deal decisively with anyone who foments
trouble over Kromah's arrest."
</P>
<P>
The Mandingoes launched strikes on Monday in Monrovia to
protest against Kromah's arrest.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG commander said in a statement that his force has
arrested 78 criminals in illegal possession of arms since the end of
the voluntary disarmament about one month ago.
</P>
<P>
The arrested include former generals from all known tribes in
Liberia, the commander said.
</P>
<P>
"ECOMOG therefore, finds it absurd and ridiculous for any person,
tribe or group to feel they are above the law and should be treated
differently," he said.
</P>
<P>
The commander also dubbed as "lies and spurious defences" the
claims by Kromah's aides, including the claims that ECOMOG had
been informed of the weapons in Kromah's house even before the
deadline but failed to collect them then.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Nationals Accused of Espionage in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Police Chief Panikos
Hadjiloizou said today a espionage case involving Turkish
nationals concerns the Republic's existence.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Cyprus radio, the Cyprus Police Chief
said the case of espionage "concerns not only National Guard
military positions but also the Republic's existence".
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus police, Nedjip Sari Cicekli, a Turkish
national of 45, along with another Turkish national Mustafa Omer
Konor of 37 and Dijan Nejip, 37, a Turkish Cypriot, were remanded
in custody for eight days last Sunday on suspicion of spying on
security and military positions of this republic.
</P>
<P>
All three from the island's Turkish-controlled northern areas
sought refuge to the government-controlled southern areas in
the early 1980s and were living in the southern coastal town of
limassol.
</P>
<P>
Police said Cicekli had confessed to spying on National
Guard's military positions over the past 18 months for Turkey,
for 2,500 Cyprus pounds (about 5,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Police had found military documents, video tapes with
military information, highlighted maps of National Guard army
camps and other relevant documents in Cicekli's car and home.
</P>
<P>
Hadjiloizou said the police are investigating all aspects of
the case, and the next step is to substantiate with unbiased
evidence, documents and information it has in its possession.
</P>
<P>
This eastern Mediterranean island has been divided and Greek
and Turkish Cypriots have lived separately since 1974 when
Turkish troops occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Syria Pledges Further Struggle to Pursue Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice President Mohamed
Zuhair Masharqa today reiterated that Syria will wage further
struggle and maintain its efforts for the establishment of peace
that can regain the occupied lands of the Arab people and restore
their dignity.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a literary festival held in Syria's Deir al Zor
province on the occasion of the Arab Teacher's Day, Masharqa said
that peace is a strategic option for Syria.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the peace which Syria is seeking to achieve
is a comprehensive and just peace based on relevant U.N.
resolutions, particularly U.N. Security Council resolutions 242,
338 and 425, in addition to the Madrid principles and the
land-for-peace formula.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is the peace that restores rights to their owners
and leads to an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights to the
borders of pre-June 4, 1967, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice president also urged Israel to pull its forces out
of south Lebanon and Lebanon's western Bekaa region. He said the
peace process has not made noticeable progress due to Israel's
failure to respond or commit itself to the requirements of peace.
</P>
<P>
Masharqa denounced Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's
attempt to resume negotiations with Syria from square one,
failing to recognize what had been achieved in the previous
negotiations. He also denounced Netanyahu's pursuit of settlement
building in the occupied Arab territories.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Confirms Presence of Sierra Leone's Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Defence Headquarters
confirmed here today the presence in Nigeria of retired Corporal
Foday Sanko, the leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) of Sierra Leone, while denying holding him for
incrimination.
</P>
<P>
Acting Director of Defence Information Col. Godwin Ugbo said
Sanko was in Nigeria last week, but dismissed reports that he
came in with any ammunition as widely reported.
</P>
<P>
He said Sanko has passed through airport formalities
hitch-free, but the presidency, informed of his presence in the
country, directed that Sanko, as an international figure, should
be handed over to the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Sanko was free to enter into the country as a western African#,
Ugbo said, noting that Sanko, since he has recognized the ruling
government in Sierra Leone, could not be regarded as a rebel
leader any more.
</P>
<P>
"He's not in detention and he's not a threat to our
security," Ugbo said, adding that Sanko is at the federal
government guest house.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been in good relations with Sierra Leone. Last
Friday the two countries signed a military agreement under which
Nigeria will help train security personnel from the Sierra
Leonean army, navy, air force and police.

Lagos, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Telecommunications Plc,
which monopolizes the country's telecommunications industry, said
today it plans to install at least one million telephone lines
throughout the country by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to Tayo Ekundayo, the company's Public Relations Manager,
the effort is part of the company's comprehensive transmission package
to develop Nigeria's telecommunications industry in line with
acceptable standards worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The package will also improve the country's current telephone lines
so that an average line could serve about 100 persons as stipulated by
the International Telecommunications Union standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria now has a total of 700,000 telephone lines, and all the
telephone cables will be buried underground, which will be more
economical and more secure from damages.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the company earned more money in 1996
than in the previous two years. However, he did not give the figure.

<P>
PARIS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- About 10,000 workers from assembly
plants of automaker Renault across Europe staged a protest in
Paris today against Renault's plan to close its Vilvoorde plant in
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The unionists of France and Belgium will organize further
actions against the decision with a planned strike in Renault
plants in France Thursday and a large-scale demonstration in
Brussels Sunday, which will be joined by numerous French leftwing
party and union leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Renault workers -- most of them Belgian workers from the
Vilvoorde plant who arrived in Paris in a convoy of 60 cars --
protested in front of the headquarters of Renault in
Boulogne-Bilancourt and on the periphery roads which run around
the outskirts of Paris.
</P>
<P>
Renault's committee of European group, which brings together
representatives of Renault's staff in its main body in France and
its branches across Europe, has asked the president of Renault,
Louis Schweitzer, to suspend the plan to close the Vilvoorde
plant.
</P>
<P>
Schweitzer has ruled out the possibility of canceling the plan
and said that his group will "ineluctably continue to reduce its
work force."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Renault workers and unionists have drawn
sympathy from most French people, with 73 percent of them having
expressed shock over Renault's decision to close its Vilvoorde
factory and its plan to carry out social restructurings in France.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Attributes Political Turmoil to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan today attributed the recent political turmoil at home to
what he called "secularist reactionaries."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Welfare Party (RP) parliamentary group meeting,
Erbakan said the political turmoil in the past weeks had shown
that there were indeed some secularist reactionaries in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that these people wanted to impose their own will
on the whole society, saying that they did not know religion.
</P>
<P>
Tension was felt between the pro-Islam government and
the military as a result of the growth of the fundamentalist
activities in the secular republic over the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
To avoid the collapse of his coalition government, Erbakan made
a U-turn by signing the 22-point recommendations made at the
February 28 military-dominated National Security Council (NSC)
aimed at curbing the increase of the fundamentalist force.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan noted that secularism was meant to act in the light of
science and rationality as well as laws enacted by the parliament
instead of imposing their own will on others.
</P>
<P>
He said his RP party wanted peace, harmony and reconciliation
to prevail in the country, adding the party was aware of the great
responsibility on its shoulder.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the whole society to combat these secularist
reactionaries because they were a threat to the country.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, however, did not say who the secularist
reactionaries were.
</P>
<P>
Before the signing of the NSC recommendations, Erbakan vowed
that the government was constitutionally responsible for the
Parliament, implying that the military was using force to put
pressure on him.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed When Gunman Storms Detroit Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A gunman killed three people
and wounded another before he was shot dead in exchange of fires
with police at a Detroit bank today.
</P>
<P>
Two employees of the Comerica bank branch on Detroit's east
side were among the dead. Another person was wounded two blocks
away in the gunfires, an Associated Press report said.
</P>
<P>
Police initially described the shootings as an attempted bank
robbery but later said the gunman's motive was unclear.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly he came into the bank and was asking for money at
some point but I don't know what his ultimate goal was," police
chief Isaiah McKinnon was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The attack began two blocks from the bank when the gunman shot
a man in the face. That man was hospitalized in serious condition.
The gunman, appeared to be in his mid- to late 20s, then drove to
the bank, police said.
</P>
<P>
It was the second deadly gunfire in a big U.S. city within 11
days. Two men died in a brazen gunfight between a bank robber and
police in Los Angeles on February 28. Sixteen police officers and
civilians were wounded or injured in the battle.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Ex-President Urges Political Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda urged here today the government to immediately commence a
genuine dialogue with opposition parties and all stakeholders in
order to realize free and fair elections in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, currently the leader of the opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP), called for suspending the Constitution
of Zambia Amendment Act 1996 and facilitating the establishment
of a constituent assembly to adopt the Constitution of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said at a press conference that all Zambians eligible
to vote should be given a chance to do so by using national
registration cards.
</P>
<P>
He also commended a reportedly widely-publicized new voter
registration exercise, saying such an exercise would be
acceptable to Zambians and encourage all the other stakeholders
to participate in.
</P>
<P>
The UNIP and some other opposition parties boycotted the
elections held last November under the Constitution of Zambia
Amendment Act 1996 which in fact barred Kaunda from running for
the presidency because his parents are foreign immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Since then the UNIP has repeatedly called for new elections to
be held in line with the 1991 Constitution. enditem

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Tourism to Regain Its Glory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
determined to reverse the declining trend in the tourism
sector so as to regain its leading position on the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, Kenya's tourism industry
experienced difficulties and failures resulting in a 20-percent
decline in tourist arrival last year alone.
</P>
<P>
The sharp reduction has prompted the government to take
immediate actions to improve security and infrastructure which
are believed to be the main causes of the failure in the sector.
</P>
<P>
A tourist police unit has been set up to patrol along the
beaches in the port city of Mombasa in a bid to enhance safety
for tourists.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Jackson Kalweo, the Minister in the
President's Office in Charge of Internal Security, said that
contingents of special tourism police force will soon be deployed
in the Masaai Mara game, a main tourist attraction in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"The special tourism police force has been very successful
patrolling the beaches at the coast and will be used to boost
security in the Masaai Mara and parts of Nairobi," he said.
</P>
<P>
The force was created in 1995 in response to an increase in
crimes targeting tourists in the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
On March 10, Tourism and Wildlife Minister Protus Momanyi said
that efforts were being made to improve requisite infrastructure
for the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
He noted that major rehabilitation and expansion of the Moi
International Airport in Mombasa had been completed with the
annual passenger handling capacity increasing from one million to
1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
The Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi is being
improved on a continuous basis and other smaller airports are also
paid attention to, he added.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Kenyan government has set aside about 50
million U.S. Dollars for the rehabilitation of more than 550
kilometers of roads and highways leading to national parks and
game reserves.
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago, a powerful delegation undertook a fact-finding
mission to the world-famous Masaai Mara Game Reserve to assess
the progress of the rehabilitation work of roads and tourism
facilities there.
</P>
<P>
Data released last week by the Executive Officer of the Kenya
Association of Hotel-Keepers and Caterers showed that hotels in
Mombasa were performing at an average of more than 70 percent
occupancy.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that Kenya's tourism industry appears to be on
the mend if the current occupancy figures are anything to go by.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi KDP Walks Out of Peace Talks in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 11 (Xinhua)-- The delegation of the Iraqi
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) today announced a complete
pullout from the Ankara peace talks with its rival Patriotic Union
of Kurdistan (PUK) and another party to protest against the
assassination of a senior KDP official in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to the Anatolia news agency, the sudden action came
after KDP delegation head Sami Abdurrahman received a call, which
said that Muhiddin Rahim, a high-ranking KDP official, was killed
in the northern Iraqi town of Erbil by members of the PUK.
</P>
<P>
Abdurrahman told reporters that "all indications and
preliminary investigations show that the PUK was directly
involved in this terrorist action."
</P>
<P>
The chief negotiator also accused the Ankara peace process
mediators, the United States, Britain and Turkey, of not
carrying out investigations, saying "they neglected what they
should not neglect."
</P>
<P>
However, Shazad Saib, a PUK representative, denied the
involvement of the PUK in the death of Muhiddin Rahim.
</P>
<P>
So far, the U.S. and Turkey have not made any statement
regarding the latest development.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the three rival parties of northern Iraq met
 here early today to discuss measures for bringing peace and
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Ankara peace process started after bitter clashes between
the Massoud Barzani-led KDP and Jalal Talabani-led PUK last
September.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain and Turkey, as sponsoring groups,
chaired a series of multilateral meetings in Ankara in a bid to
work out a peaceful solution to the problem in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Highlights Agriculture, Industry in Sichuan (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li said that the central authorities have mapped out six
measures to improve the performance of state-owned enterprises,
and that the next key step is to carry out these measures
effectively.
</P>
<P>
"We should adhere to the principle of reforming and upgrading
large enterprises and giving more freedom to small ones," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it has been proved by the development of
the Changhong Group, one of China's leading TV manufacturers based
in Sichuan, that by introducing and absorbing advanced technology
from abroad, strengthening management and developing economies of
scale, an enterprise can improve the market competitiveness of its
products and raise its efficiency.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the necessity to take care of employees in
enterprises that have stopped production or are operating under
capacity, and to help them overcome livelihood-related
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative to establish and improve a minimum living
standard system, so as to guarantee these workers' basic living
needs," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the State Council's motion presented to the current
NPC session on elevating Chongqing to the status of a municipality
directly under the authority of the central government, he said
that the proposal had gone through repeated studies and
discussions by the central authorities and local governments.
</P>
<P>
If the motion is approved by the NPC, he noted, Chongqing will
face both opportunities and difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"As one of our country's old industrial bases, Chongqing made
and is still making significant contributions to the state," he
said. "Though there remain a lot of difficulties and problems,
Chongqing should not lose sight of its own advantages and of the
present rare opportunity for development, and should by no means
underestimate itself."
</P>
<P>
He said the municipality's development in future will depend
first of all on self-reliant, hard efforts of its people, and
secondly on assistance from other provinces and cities as well as
preferential policies granted by the central government.
</P>
<P>
"Sichuan Province and the city of Chongqing must enhance unity
and support each other for mutual development," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that after the passing away of Deng Xiaoping, the
people of Sichuan, Deng's hometown, had been stricken with deep
grief just as people in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that under the leadership of the Party Central
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, we can surely
carry work forward at the behest of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, make
our country more prosperous, and turn the hometown of Comrade
Xiaoping into a better and prettier place," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Chairman of Myanmar State Law
and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) and Army Commander-in-Chief
Gen. Maung Aye met with his Thai counterpart Chetta Thanajaro
today in Myawaddy, a border town in Kayin state, state-run Radio
Myanmar reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting was first secretary of the SLORC Lt.
Gen. Khin Nyunt.
</P>
<P>
The military leaders inspected the construction work of the
Myanmar-Thai Friendship Bridge which links Myanmar's Myawaddy and
Thailand's Mae Sot, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed early completion of construction of the
bridge, development of border trade and border security, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
The bridge project was suspended in June 1995 by Myanmar due to
disputes over border demarcation between Myanmar and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Thai army commander-in-chief had met his Myanmar
counterpart in Tachilek, another Myanmar border town in Shan state
late last month and their discussions were centered on border
security issues, according to earlier official reports.

<HEADLINE> Israel Develops Advanced Solar-Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have
developed an advanced solar-power plant, according to a report
released by the Weizmann Institute of Science this week.
</P>
<P>
The system, developed by the Weizmann Institute, uses special
optics and an innovative air receiver to reflect, focus and
convert sunlight, raising temperatures high enough to directly
power gas and steam turbines in a combined cycle and thus
generate electricity.
</P>
<P>
The option of using either solar, gas, or a combination of
the two guarantees power even under cloudy skies. The
application of combined cycles assures very high efficiency in
all modes of operation. Recent market assessments suggest that
this new technology has broad potential for applications around
the world.
</P>
<P>
The system contains a number of innovations, including a solar
receiver with hundreds of ceramic pins arranged in a geometric
pattern that maximizes the collection and use of sunlight. Much
of the research was supported by the then Ministry of Energy (now
Transport, Energy and Infrastructure Ministry).
</P>
<P>
U.S. aerospace giant McDonnell Douglas, along with Israeli
Ormat Industries, Rotem Industries and the Weizmann Institute's
Yeda Research and Development Company, have won a
5.3-million-U.S.-dollar contract to demonstrate the commercial
feasibility of the system.
</P>
<P>
The contract was awarded by the U.S.-Israel Science and
Technology Commission. The agreement was signed at the
U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Israeli team will develop an operational 200 to 300
kilowatt system to be located at the Weizmann Institute's solar
research facility, called the Canadian Institute for the
Energies and Applied Research, in Rehovot near Tel Aviv. Highly
reflective mirrors, called heliostats, will track the sun and
reflect it up to another mirror located on a central tower. This
reflector will send the sunlight back down to a matrix of
optical devices able to concentrate the light so that it becomes
5,000 to 10,000 times more powerful than natural sunlight
reaching earth.
</P>
<P>
This powerful radiation will then enter solar receivers on
the ground and, in turn, heat compressed air to drive the
turbogenerator to produce electricity.

<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Linford Christie, who announced
his retirment last year, will make a shock return in time for
August's world athletics championships in Athens, according to
fellow British sprinter Darren Braithwaite.
</P>
<P>
"I am almost certain that he will return to the world
championships," said his close friend Braithwaite on Wednesday,
according to a press report here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"He is running as quick as he ever has and there is no reason
why he can't compete with the best.
</P>
<P>
Christie, 36, who won Olympic gold at Barcelona in 1992 and
became grandfather last year, dropped hints at the weekend about a
return to international athletics when he told BBC television that
he was not sure his days at the top were over.
</P>
<P>
Another indication that former world champion Christie will run
in Athens is the news that he will fly to Florida just prior to
the World Championships to train with fellow Britons Tony Jarrett,
Braithwaite and Colin Jackson.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Highlights Agriculture, Industry in Sichuan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng urged China's
most populous province to always put agriculture at the first
place in its economic work.
</P>
<P>
Joining a group discussion of the Sichuan delegation to the
fifth session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), the
legislature, Li cited Sichuan as a big agricultural province with
a large population and said that it should always put agriculture
at the top of its economic work and make a great effort to
increase grain production.
</P>
<P>
"As Sichuan has a big population but relatively limited
farmland, it should rely on advanced, applicable technology and on
scientific and technological progress to raise grain output," the
Premier told the deputies.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the southwestern province mainly to develop rural
and township enterprises that focus on the processing of farm
produce in order to increase farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan has scored the synchronous growth of grain output and
population, and this is a major contribution not only to itself
but also to the country as a whole, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the premier gave a high credit to Sichuan for its
consecutive good agricultural harvests over recent years, the
continuous improvement of its people's living standards and the
marked progress it had made in all aspects of its work.

<HEADLINE> Strong US Dollar Helps Ease Inflation Pressure in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The US dollar is expected to
remain strong in the near future, which would help ease
inflationary pressures in Hong Kong, according to the latest Hang
Seng Economic Monthly issued by Hang Seng Bank.
</P>
<P>
The monthly said that the US dollar appreciated by 20 percent
in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate index over the
past 22 months. Under the linked exchange rate system, the Hong
Kong dollar also surged by over 50 percent against the Japanese
yen and 23 percent against the German Mark over the same period.
</P>
<P>
It said that due to the relative stability of the Chinese
Renminbi, the Hong Kong dollar increased by eight percent on an
effective basis.
</P>
<P>
The corresponding strength of the Hong Kong dollar would ease
inflationary pressures by lowering import prices, it said.
</P>
<P>
With the surge of the Hong Kong dollar, import prices have
continued to go downward in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Despite an expected rebound in economic activities, overall
inflation would remain moderate, averaging about seven percent for
the whole year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The strong dollar resulted in a 1.2 percent fall in import
prices in 1996, but export prices only fell by 0.3 percent due to
the effect of other input costs.
</P>
<P>
As the appreciation of the local currency would erode the
relative price competitiveness of local products in the world
market, slower growth in export volume can be expected, it said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Budget Straddling Handover Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Financial Secretary
 Donald Tsang Yam-kuen today presented to the Legislative Council
the 1997-98 financial budget entitled "Continuity in a Time of
Change," which is to straddle the handover on July 1, 1997, when
China resumes the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The budget covers the last three months under the British rule
and the first nine months of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
The 1997-98 financial year starts runs from April 1, 1997, to
March 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary forecast that the government
expenditure, with payments from the Capital Investment Fund
included, will amount to 203 billion HK dollars (26 billion US
dollars), representing an increase of 24.5 billion HK dollars (3.1
billion US dollars) over the revised estimate for 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Education will be the single largest spending item in the
proposed budget, taking 45 billion HK dollars (5.8 billion US
dollars), an increase of 7.7 percent over the 1996-97 financial
year. About 300 million HK dollars (38.5 million US dollars) will
be devoted to computer training for primary school students.
</P>
<P>
Public housing is expected to cut a big slice of the cake, with
32 billion HK dollars (4.1 billion US dollars), while expenditure
on health care and welfare for the elderly, the disabled and
families at risk will grow to 28 billion HK dollars (3.6 billion
US dollars) and 21 billion dollars (2.7 billion US dollars)
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Tsang predicted that the total receipts in the 1997-98
financial year will reach 234.7 billion HK dollars (30 billion US
dollars), up 32.4 billion HK dollars (4.2 billion US dollars) over
the estimate for the previous financial year.
</P>
<P>
On the revenue side, the financial secretary proposed to raise
the allowance for both single and married persons by 11.1 percent,
cut the marginal tax rates as measures to benefit the sandwich
class, reduce the overall rates percentage charge from 5.5 percent
to 5 percent, and lower stamp duty on property transactions valued
below 4 million HK dollars (above 510,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
He forecast an overall budget surplus of 32 billion HK dollars
(four billion US dollars) for the 1997-98 financial year.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary expected the GDP growth to pick up at
5.5 percent, inflation to harbor at 7 percent, and exports to rise

</P>
<P>
In conclusion, he said: "We will begin our new life as a
Special Administrative Region of China with total reserves of
around 330 billion HK dollars (42.3 billion US dollars)."
</P>
<P>
Mr. Tsang reviewed the consultation process between China and
Britain to produce the 1997-98 budget. The Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group started experts talks in 1995 on the budget for the
transitional period and reached consensus a week ago after 19
rounds of negotiations over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
China has insisted that the budget be drafted in line with
three principles -- taking as a guideline the related stipulations
in the Basic Law, taking into account the interests of all sectors
of Hong Kong and systematically drafting the budget through
cooperation between the Chinese and British sides.
</P>
<P>
While presenting the budget today, the financial secretary
said: "We have drawn up a budget which not only follows strictly
our traditional principles of prudent financial management, but
also complies with the provisions of the Basic Law, which will
come into effect on July 1."
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, the HKSAR chief executive, said that the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) would scrutinize the budget
because it covered nine months of the work of the HKSAR
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Polytechnic
University's Building Services Engineering course was recently
presented with the prestigious Happold Brilliant award, the
university announced today.
</P>
<P>
The award was established in memory of the late British teacher
of engineering Edmund Happold.
</P>
<P>
The course, Bachelor of Engineering (Honors) in Building
Services Engineering, was judged by the Accreditation Panel of the
Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) to be
the most innovative and well-crafted program that they viewed
during 1996.
</P>
<P>
The award will be presented to John Burnett, head of the
PolyU's Department of Building Services Engineering, on April 3,
1997, at the Royal Society of Arts in England.
</P>
<P>
Happold dedicated his life to the world of architecture and
engineering. In 1995 he proposed to CIBSE that he donate an
annual prize to the course judged by the Institution to have
contributed most to the quality of teaching of building services
engineering at undergraduate level.
</P>
<P>
Building services engineering covers the design, installation,
testing and operating of engineering systems in buildings. It is
the "art and science" of providing a safe, healthy and
energy-efficient environment inside buildings of all kinds, such
as the thermal environment, lighting quality, noise, indoor air
quality, etc.
</P>
<P>
The PolyU's program, with both full-time and part-time modes of
study, is intended to meet Hong Kong's need for locally-trained
professionals and innovative building services engineering to work
in consultancy, contracting, building operation and research and
development.
</P>
<P>
The program prepares graduates for professional practice in a
wider geographical area than Hong Kong.

<P>
SHENZHEN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A top real estate developer in
south China's Shenzhen Special Economic Zone has pinned high hopes
on the upcoming return of Hong Kong to the Chinese sovereignty on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
The city's real estate sector will be one of the leading
beneficiaries after the return of the free-port territory, Zhang
Bao said at today's annual work conference of his company,
Shenzhen Construction and Investment Holdings Corporation, one of
the city's three largest government-owned land developers.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Zhang urged his staff to grasp this historical
opportunity to accelerate the development of the firm, noting that
the company is expected to reap 3.68 billion yuan from land
development, including 1.07 billion yuan in profit.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the prices in the local real estate market are
rebounding. But a huge gap still exists between the prices in
Shenzhen and Hong Kong, so that the city's real estate market has
broad prospects and great potential, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He asked the audience to pay special attention to the enormous
impact of Hong Kong's return to China's sovereignty on the city's
economic development and the relevant changes in its real estate
market.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to increase the value of its general assets
from 32.5 billion yuan in 1996 to 65 billion yuan by 2001, he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China's family planning work
should be improved through science and education, State Councillor
Peng Peiyun said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national conference on family planning which
closed here today, Peng, also the minister in charge of the State
Family Planning Commission, said that effective measures should be
taken to improve the scientific studies on family planning,
educate the public about contraception, and upgrade the family
planning services.
</P>
<P>
She said that China's 400,000 family planning workers above
town and township levels need better education and training.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the quality of the grassroots family planning
officials has improved, but most of them still do not have adequate
education and lack professional training, Peng said.
</P>
<P>
In some poverty-stricken areas where it is difficult to carry
out family planning work, the related organizations cannot keep a
steady workforce.
</P>
<P>
Peng said that the workers in the field should take the
initiative to step up reforms by investigating the work at the
grassroots level, reflecting on new experiences, showing concern
for human suffering and helping people settle their problems.
</P>
<P>
She called on all the family planning workers to follow the
example of Jiang Shuqin, one such worker in Fengning Manchurian
Autonomous County of Hebei Province, who has received public
recognition for her devotion to her job.
</P>
<P>
Peng hoped that the family organizations at all levels will
name more model workers and award outstanding employees.

<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- City ruins, the remains of a
residential building and a group of tombs have been found at a
3,000-year-old site in a southern Beijing suburb.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the site is one of the few from
the early Western Zhou Dynasty (11th Century-771 BC) to include
such complete remains.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 relics, including pottery, stone, jade, bone, and
proto-porcelain, have been unearthed from some 200 architectural
ruins.
</P>
<P>
The experts seemed most excited at finding dozens of oracle
shells, among them three that bear inscriptions.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, the shells were typical of the
Western Zhou period, with polished backs and traces of carvings
and burn marks.
</P>
<P>
The site caught the limelight a few years ago when it offered
the first evidence that the history of city-building in the
Beijing area can be traced back as far as 3,000 years.

CANBERRA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian and American military

"Although at times stymied by Tropical Cyclone Justin, exercise
planners are increasingly confident that most, if not all, of the
training objectives can be accomplished," Capt Harvey said.

area to enhance the training of our staff."

</P>
<P>
The agreement is under the second phase of Lome IV Convention

He said the focus of the NIP included promotion of sustainable
economic growth, particularly development of transport, urban
water supply and basic education.

national resources spread throughout, Tanzania needed modern,
efficient and effective domestic and international transport," he

Lome IV Convention, NIP also gives attention to development and
consolidation of democracy, the rule of law and respect of human

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt Stops Loans to Individual Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has with
immediate effect stopped giving agriculture loans to individual
farmers, and instead, advised them to form groups or primary
cooperatives to have access to credit.
</P>
<P>
The stand was revealed in a statement by Agriculture Minister
Edith Nawakwi that is available here today.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi said the government is currently holding consultations
on how to create an appropriate financing mechanism for farmers'
groups and cooperatives. Deserving farmers' groups will be
targeted for a wide range of financial services and capital
investment support.
</P>
<P>
"Under this initiative, we will not deal with individual
farmers. Only organized farmers' groups with a clear purpose and
program for their members will be considered," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said the government will devise ways of
providing interim grants and technical assistance for those areas
where it will be impossible to create cooperatives or farmers'
groups to enable them to make a start.
</P>
<P>
As for reason of the change, Nawakwi said that in the past credit
to farmers was directed at individuals, resulting in high transaction
costs and default rates with Lima bank which is a bank for farmers,
still grappling to collect 14 billion Kwacha (10 million U.S. Dollars
according to the current exchange rate) it is owed by farmers.
</P>
<P>
"This has led the government to continue pouring large sums of
public money into a bottomless pit from which no one gains and
everybody loses," she said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects International Pressure in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel has expressed its
opposition to international pressure in the current crisis with
the Palestinians, threatening that it would freeze the peace
process, reported the state-run Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy made the remarks at a
hastily-arranged press conference Tuesday in response to an idea
raised by Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser
Arafat on holding an international conference in Gaza to discuss
the current crisis in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat invited Tuesday the U.S., European and Arab envoys to a
meeting Saturday to discuss the rising crisis after Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu approved last week a new plan of
settlement building in Har Homa of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He said that the effort by the Palestinians towards getting
what he called outside intervention runs contrary to what has been
agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials were reported to be trying to persuade the
United States not to send a representative. However, the U.S. has
responded positively to Arafat's call. U.S. State Department
Spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters Tuesday that
U.S. Consul-General in Jerusalem Edward Abington would attend the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Burns said, "We understand the level of frustration on the
part of the Palestinians. But the only way something good is
going to happen is they continue to talk to the Israeli
government, and that's what we encourage them to do."
</P>
<P>
Levy defended Israeli decision to build a new Jewish
settlement at Har Homa in the Arab East Jerusalem and withdraw
from no more than 9 percent of the West Bank in the first stage of
further redeployment, saying that it does not contradict any
agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The PNA requested a 30 percent of pullbacks in the first stage
of further redeployment in the area.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that an international wave of protests would not
influence the government's decision. Reversing the decision would
only set a precedent for applying pressure on Israel in the
future, he added.
</P>
<P>
Levy said that Israel can not be held hostage by the PNA
pressure and threats.

<HEADLINE> Nyanda Appointed Deputy Chief of S. Africa's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- South African Defense
Minister Joe Modise has appointed former African National
Congress (ANC) military leader Siphiwe Nyanda as deputy chief of
the South African National Defense Force (SANDF), local daily the
Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The appointment means Nyanda will in all probability succeed
General George Meiring as chief late next year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
While making the appointment yesterday at a press conference
in Pretoria, the administrative capital of South Africa, Modise
said the SANDF was on the threshold of having its first black
generals as chiefs of various divisions.
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the 28 appointments announced at the press
conference come from the ranks of non-statutory forces like
former ANC military wing Umkhonto Wesiz.
</P>
<P>
The new appointments have been made in terms of the
transformation and restructuring, announced last month, of the
Ministry of Defense and the SANDF, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This streamlining of the top administrative levels is
expected to produce a saving of about 300 million Rands (68.18
million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Altogether 28 new appointments were made in the restructuring
of the Defense Ministry by Modise, including divisions such as
defense intelligence, policy and planning, logistics policy and
support.
</P>
<P>
The creation of an integrated civilian/military structure
will bring to an end existing duplication of functions and
multiplication of expenses, modise wa quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Pins Down Date for Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Beating a firm note, Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat has said an
independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital will
be declared in the self-rule areas once the interim stage ends.
</P>
<P>
"So far, three years passed (since the Oslo interim peace
accord) and two years remain (until the transitional period ends)
on May 5 1999," Arafat told the Egyptian T.V.'s "Behind the
Events" program Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
He said that the declaration of the state of Palestine in 1999
was not a coincidence as it came with the free will of the
Palestinian people and all Arabs as well as the friends around the
world.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, a total of 170 countries have recognized the state
of Palestine, a permanent member in the Arab League, the
Non-alignment Movement and the Organization of Islamic Conference,
said the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
It is also an observer in the Organization of the African Unity
and the United Nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's reassertion of the Palestinian determination to set up
their own state came amid wide-spread pessimisms and frustrations
among his people over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Seven PNA Cabinet ministers have threatened to resign over
recent Israeli decisions to withdraw from only 9 percent of mainly
rural West Bank in its first of three-stage further pullbacks from
the occupied land, a far cry from the 30 percent Arafat had
demanded.
</P>
<P>
Infuriated, Arafat said Israel has no right to unilaterally
decide the scope of the phased withdrawals and refused to
coordinate with Israel on the transfer of authority in the areas
slated for a pullback, putting the withdrawal on hold.
</P>
<P>
The final status talks scheduled to start this month is feared
to be put off by the mounting Israeli-Palestinian tensions over
Israeli decisions to build 6,500 Jewish homes and close four
Palestinian offices in East Jerusalem, where Palestinians want to
establish the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had even threatened to unilaterally declare the
Palestinian state in retaliation against the Israeli settlement
decision. Israel cried foul and said Palestinians would violate
Oslo accords by doing so.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslos, more sensitive issues such as borders, the
status of Jerusalem and Palestinian statehood would be resolved
in the final talks which should end by mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
The PNA now controls the Gaza Strip and seven West Bank towns
handed over by Israel under several agreements signed since
1993. It expects to control over 90 percent of the West Bank after
the completion of the third phase of Israeli troop redeployment in
the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiyouni told the
Egyptian T.V. program that the Palestinian statehood is actually
in the building.
</P>
<P>
"Israeli troops pulled out of main West Bank cities of Jenin,
Nablus, Tulkarm, Qaloiliyah, Bethlehem, Ramallah and Hebron. And
this marks the start of building the Palestinian state," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have called for U.S. and Arab intervention in
the peace process. Arafat would invite diplomats from the U.S.,
Russia, Japan, European countries and the Arab world to Gaza
Saturday to discuss the deadlock in the talks.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Defends Policies in Response to King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has defended his policies in response to a
letter from Jordanian King Hussein who warned that Israel's recent
moves could torpedo the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hussein sent a long letter to Netanyahu Sunday to express his
disappointment and frustration with the current tension in the
Israeli-Palestinian ties, which was caused by Israel's unilateral
decision on further troop redeployments on the West Bank and its
decision to build a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said that Israel's "tragic actions" and policies are
making peace a "distant, elusive mirage."
</P>
<P>
He deplored Israel's decision to build in Har Homa in
southeastern Jerusalem, warning that if the construction starts,
bloodshed would be virtually inevitable because of the
"Palestinian and Arab sensitivity, anger, and despair."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of further redeployments, the king said that
Israel's decision to withdraw from another 9 percent of West Bank
in the first of three-stage pullbacks is "insignificant" and it
makes "humiliation of your so called Palestinian partners"
continued.
</P>
<P>
The three-page letter, published wholly on today's The
Jerusalem Post, suggested the rift between King Hussein and
Netanyahu is far deeper than has been previously acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
Hussein also questioned his personal relationship with
Netanyahu in light of recent Israeli moves. Only late last month,
Netanyahu paid a visit to Jordan before his cabinet made the
decision to build settlement in Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
In response, Netanyahu wrote back to the king Monday, calling
for not letting the Israeli-Jordanian relations and their own
personal relationship to be held hostage to the
Israeli-Palestinian disputes, the Post reported.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot make the Jordanian-Israeli relationship hostage to
the Palestinian-Israeli negotiating track. We cannot give every
Palestinian-Israeli impasse the power to hurt our own
relationship," he said.
</P>
<P>
Regretting "the personal attacks" against him, Netanyahu said
his conclusion is that Hussein is "not being fully apprised of the
true picture" of Israel's security situation.
</P>
<P>
He also rebutted Hussein's statements that Israel's decision
on further redeployments is insignificant.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "despite tremendous resistance from some in my
own constituency, I have chosen the path of the Oslo process."
</P>
<P>
In a bid to mend the rift between the two sides, Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai traveled to Amman Tuesday. He
tried to alleviate Jordan's anxiety and frustration over the
Israeli-Palestinian deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said that, despite the relations have their ups and
downs, but in the long run tensions would subside and peace would
reign not only among Israel and Jordan, Egypt, and the
Palestinian Authority, but also with other Arab countries as
well.

<HEADLINE> Macao Life Insurance Income Shows Continuous Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Income from life insurance shot
up by 19.6 percent in 1996, marking the 19th growth year
of the insurance business in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures from the Macao Currency and Foreign Exchange
Supervising Department show that life insurance income reached 330
million patacas (about 41.8 million US dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Macao experts attributed the rise to the technological
progress, increased insurance items, better guarantee of policy
buyers' interests and the change of local residents' idea on the
insurance.
</P>
<P>
"The life insurance business still has a great market potential
to tap this year," said Chan Sin-Tau, deputy-secretary-general of
the Macao Insurers' Association, at a recent seminar. "Its income
may surpass that from the non-life insurance business."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the growth of non-life insurance business has slowed
down, inching up only 1.6 percent in 1996, compared with the
7.2-percent growth in 1995. Four of the 15 non-life insurance
companies in Macao even recorded negative growth between 14
percent and 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown was blamed on an overall sluggish economy, the
lower-growth rate of real estate and construction and the
completion of major projects like the Macao International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Income from fire insurance achieved a 6.6-percent growth,
automobile insurance income rose by 8.4 percent and ocean shipping
insurance income 4.8 percent. But the income from labor insurance
plunged 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Macao now has 21 insurance companies, including those from the
United States, Canada, Japan, Portugal, Hong Kong, Britain and
Australia. Six of them are handling life insurance
business.

<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Britain-based Coats Co., the
world's biggest supplier of thread used in garments and textile
materials, will hold three technical seminars in China in a move
to extend its involvement in the growing clothing market here.
</P>
<P>
The first seminar opened in Beijing today; the others will be
held in Shanghai and Guangzhou later this month.
</P>
<P>
Addressing today's seminar, Luo Dawang, director of the
Auxiliary Materials Committee of the China Garment Association,
said that the country's clothing industry greatly needs
high-quality threads, as domestic manufacturers have difficulty
producing durable and different-colored threads.
</P>
<P>
China's clothing sector now has a yearly production capability
of eight billion garments, but most the high-grade clothing items
for export rely on foreign threads.
</P>
<P>
Luo said that the country's textile industry will increase
exchange and cooperation with overseas thread manufacturers, and
improve the quality of domestic thread products by importing more
foreign technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
David Gildchrist, managing director of the Hong Kong-based
Coats China Co., said that the British company, with an annual
turnover of 1.6 billion US dollars, has established six joint
ventures in Guangzhou and Tianjin. These companies involve a total
investment of 60 million US dollars, and specialize in the
business of cotton spinning, weaving and dyeing.
</P>
<P>
Coats is now seeking to expand its sales to the country's large
and medium-sized textile enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Projects Biggest Air Traffic Growth in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Commercial Airplane
Group's 1997 edition of "Current Market Outlook" predicts the
world's biggest air travel growth will continue to be in China
over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Chinese airlines will add 1,900 new
jets worth 124 billion US dollars over the next two
decades. Overall, the world's airlines will add 16,160 jetliners
worth 1.1 trillion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing forecast projects annual worldwide air travel growth
of 4.9 percent. The traffic growth in China is estimated to total
8.7 percent per year, which is the leading growth rate globally.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of China's domestic air travel is expected to
rise by 10.3 percent and the international traffic to and from
China to increase by six percent.
</P>
<P>
The report projects the Asia-Pacific region will outpace all
other areas of the world in traffic growth, with annual projected
growth rate of 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The region will also continue to be the world's leading market
for new airplanes with 33 percent of the dollars invested coming
from the area.
</P>
<P>
Boeing projects the single-aisle airplanes -- the size of the
Boeing 737s and 757s -- will have the largest market potential,
accounting for 43 percent of the dollars invested in the world's
fleet by the year 2016.
</P>
<P>
The mid-size airplanes, such as the Boeing 767 and 777, are in
the fastest-growing segment of the market, which comprises 39
percent of the dollar-value total, or 3,720 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
The smallest market portion is made up of 747s or larger
airplanes, which are expected to claim 18 percent of the purchase
value in new airplanes.

<HEADLINE> S'pore's Manufacturing Output Down 7.2 Pc in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The output of manufactured
products of Singapore declined by 7.2 percent in January this year
compared to a year ago, due mainly to a slowdown in most of the
major industries, the Economic Development Board (EDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
It said the electronics industry fell by 10.9 percent compared
to January 1996, as declines were recorded across most segments
except in disk drive and telecommunication equipment.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, output of personal computers, other computer
peripherals, semiconductors and consumer electronics were
constrained by slow orders from overseas, the EDB observed.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with the slowdown in the electronics industry, the
output of fabricated metal products and plastic products
industries decreased by 7.4 percent and 21.5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The output of the chemical industries, including petroleum,
petrochemical, pharmaceuticals and specialty chemical industries,
declined marginally by 0.9 percent due to the reduced output of
petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The output of transport equipment declined by 7.3 percent as
the down trend in the marine segment continued, while increased
output from the aviation segment was sustained by overseas orders,

<HEADLINE> Lei Feng's Name Kept Alive In China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A newly-released movie about Lei
Feng, a model solder in the 1960s who is well-known among the
Chinese for his selfless deeds, has attracted nearly 500,000
viewers in the Chinese capital in only 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The film, titled "Days Without Lei Feng", has beaten out Hong
Kong's recently-released "Mr. Nice Guy", starring the
internationally-known Jacky Chan, in the number of viewers, the
Beijing Film Corp. reports, and the Beijing audience is expected
to exceed one million.
</P>
<P>
Lei Feng was an ordinary soldier of the People's Liberation
Army who devoted himself to serving the public and helping the
needy, but who was killed in an accident in 1962 at the age of 22.
</P>
<P>
On March 5, 1963, the late Chairman Mao Zedong wrote an
inscription, calling on the people throughout the country to
"Learn from Comrade Lei Feng", and from that time on, the "spirit
of Lei Feng" was encouraged among the Chinese people for the next
30 years.
</P>
<P>
The movie tells the story through the eyes of Qiao Anshan,
Lei's comrade-in-arms, who accidentally struck a pole while
driving a truck, that killed Lei. Suffering from a sense of
remorse and self-reproaching, Qiao tries to learn from Lei to help
those in difficulty and fights corruption for the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
"Lei always treated other's troubles as his own. and I have
only done what he would do if he were still alive," says Qiao, who
is now 56 and living in northeast China's Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
Although the movie has neither heroic figures nor an exciting
plot, it has still moved thousands of viewers. "The spirit of Lei
centers on kindness, unselfishness, and devotion to public
interests, which should be continued forever," said one old man
with feeling.
</P>
<P>
Many young couples took their children to see the movie,
and one fashionably-dressed young man said, "The story drew its
material from the life of real people, so it looked quite close to
our daily lives. I like it."

NEW DELHI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- India's Minister of State for

"As a result of the reform and opening-up, great changes have
taken place in Chinese people's concept of value. Yet the spirit
of Lei Feng shouldn't just be discarded," said a CPPCC National
Committee member from northwest China's Shaanxi province.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of 1993, the Central Committee of the Communist
Youth League of China (CYLC) has had a nationwide "Young
Volunteers Activity", calling on Chinese, especially young people,
to learn from Comrade Lei Feng.
</P>
<P>
"Millions of young Chinese have taken part in the activity and
have volunteered to lend a hand to the needy and to do more good
deeds," according to an official with the CYLC.
</P>
<P>
China has some 54,380 volunteer service agencies nationwide and
more than ten million volunteers from all walks of life. They are
involved in various activities to help the disabled, those in need
of assistance, and childless old people. They also offer financial
help to people living in the country's poorest areas and do rescue
and reconstruction work in disaster-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to fill the world with warm sunshine, bright smiles,
and lasting friendship," said one girl student volunteer, who
added that she would like to contribute more to society.

<HEADLINE> India Criticizes US for Non-Tariff Barrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- India has criticized the United
States for introducing the "rules of origin" in trade, saying that
such a move would affect trade through the third country.
</P>
<P>
"This move is nothing but yet another non-tariff barrier," said
a textile ministry official here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the "rules of origin," any textile product, if
exported to another country for printing or dyeing and re-exported
by the second country, would be deemed by the US to have
originated from the first country, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Under such "rule," the US authorities have started treating
some of Bangladeshi exports to the US as exports of India. With
this, India's textile exports, particularly ready-made garments,
have suffered, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The latest trade data have revealed that exports of ready-made
garments in April-December 1996-97 declined to 322.15 million US
dollars, as against 326 million dollars in the corresponding
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The ready-made garments exports in December alone remained
stagnant at 40 million US dollars, he further said.

<HEADLINE> End of Arbitrary Detention Stressed in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Khmer Nation Party (KNP)
President Sam Rainsy said here today that First Prime Minister
Norodom Ranariddh has promised to stop arbitrary detention in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy made the remarks while meeting parliamentarians at
the National Assembly to voice KNP complaints over the case of
Srun Vong Vannak, who was arrested on February 14 by Phnom Penh
Municipal Penal Police on charge of planning the murder of the
brother-in-law of Second Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy said he had obtained a pledge from Ranariddh to
protect politicians from arbitrary arrest or confinement and to
fairly treat Vannak who is still under detention.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh had promised not to let arbitrary acts shown in the
case of Vannak to continue and to take firm measures to ensure no
more politicians be harmed in such way, he added.
</P>
<P>
Charging the police with violation of the Constitution and
other laws, the KNP disclosed that the police had political
affiliation with the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), a major
party in the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The KNP leaders submitted to the parliamentarians a list of 10
demands including "immediate release of Vannak."
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the parliamentarians, Sam Rainsy led 150
demonstrators to the Ministry of Justice, where he was received by
a secretary of state from the Funcinpec, another main party in the
coalition government, and was given a promise that the KNP's
demands would be properly considered.

<HEADLINE> JLG Experts Meeting on Defense canceled due to British Absence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-British Joint Liaison
Group (JLG) failed to hold its 23rd experts meeting on defense and
public security today as scheduled because the British team was
absent without reason, according to the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zuo'er, Chinese representative on the JLG, said that in
line with the agreement between the two sides, Chinese experts
arrived at No. 28, Kennedy Road on Hong Kong Island -- the meeting
venue -- at 9:30 am to negotiate with their British counterparts
on defense and public security. But the British representative did
not show up after the Chinese team had waited for one and a half
hours.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the venue, Chen said: "We come to attend the
meeting in accordance with the agreement between the two sides,
and to put it more precisely, we come here according to the time
and place proposed by the British side. We feel very regretful
that the British experts team suddenly broke the agreement and
failed to show up."
</P>
<P>
While waiting for the British experts, the Chinese side called
the British representative office, but only heard recorded
message, said the Chinese diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed the hope that the British side should come back
to the negotiation table as soon as possible, and take substantial
moves to enhance the Sino-British cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Now Hong Kong, China and the whole world are paying close
attention to the smooth transition of Hong Kong. Since defense and
public security are one of the key parts in the transfer of
political power, we hope that China and Britain could cooperate
well."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese experts came from the Ministry of National Defense,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the JLG Chinese
representative office.
</P>
<P>
At the last experts meeting on defense and public security on
January 28, 1997, the Chinese side presented a more flexible plan
on sending advanced troops to Hong Kong before the handover, and
expected to draw a positive reply from the British side, added
Chen.

<HEADLINE> HK Jewelry Industry Sees Brisk Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's jewelry exports and
domestic sales are expected to register an even better performance
this year, Hong Kong Secretary for Trade and Industry Denise Yue
said today.
</P>
<P>
She was presiding over an opening ceremony of the 14th Hong
Kong International Jewelry Show, which attracted a record 619
exhibitors from 26 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hong Kong exported 10.6 billion Hong Kong dollars
(1.36 billion US dollars) worth of jewelry products, some 38
percent of which went to the United States, Yue said.
</P>
<P>
Given the positive projection of the American economy this
year, she noted, the prospects for the territory's jewelry trade
are very good.
</P>
<P>
And domestic sales of jewelry are also flourishing. "A good
indication is the great number of jewelry shops in Hong Kong which
offer a wide and attractive range of products," she said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, visitors to Hong Kong purchased jewelry worth around
7.9 billion HK dollars (1.01 billion US dollars), representing a
14 percent increase over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the ceremony were Executive Director of the
Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC), Michael Sze, and
leaders of Hong Kong's four major jewelry trade associations.
</P>
<P>
Sze described the increase in the number of overseas
exhibitors, from 130 in 1996 to 161 this year, as "a strong
indication that our objective of making this fair a truly
international showcase is succeeding."
</P>
<P>
The show, co-organized by the TDC and the associations, runs
until Saturday at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center.
More than 10,000 buyers and visitors from around the world are
expected to visit the show.
</P>
<P>
Exhibits include a variety of finely crafted precious jewelry,
jewelry watches, precious and semi-precious stones, carvings and
ornaments, spare parts and tools for jewelry products.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Extend Grant to Rice Research Institute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government plans to
extend an initial one-million-U.S.-dollar grant to the
International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), which is based 65
kilometers south of Manila.
</P>
<P>
The amount will be additional to the country's annual
contribution of 50,000 to 100,000 U.S. dollars to the institute,
the Philippines News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The donation had already been recommended to President Fidel
Ramos by Agriculture Secretary Salvador Escudero and University of
the Philippines President Emil Javier, who sit as ex-official and
vice chairman of the IRRI board, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation is for the Philippine government to provide
the money as an endowment fund for the Asian Rice Foundation now
being organized by IRRI.
</P>
<P>
To further shore up IRRI's resource support, Escudero and
Javier also urged the Department of Foreign Affairs to ask
"friendly" donor governments, both western and rice-growing
nations, to help bail out IRRI from its financial woes.
</P>
<P>
They said Asian countries which have benefited from IRRI's
grains research in the past and up to now must increasingly take
on the burden of supporting IRRI since 94 percent of the world's
rice supply is produced in the region.
</P>
<P>
Severe funding shortfalls in 1996 and 1997 have forced IRRI to
lay off its staff by more than 550 persons. The shortfalls, which
will reach six million U.S. dollars this year, stem from the
inability of several of IRRI's major donors including the United
States to maintain their previous funding levels.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Moves to Promote Development of Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Starting this summer, the
Philippine Department of Tourism will be undertaking special
promotion projects to spur interest in the Philippine Tourism
Highway Program.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor said here today that on the third
week of March, the department will be coordinating the motorcycle
marathon tour of Ian Foster who will traverse the southern portion
of the highway starting from Davao to Manila.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine leg is one part of Ian Foster's solo motorcycle
tour around Southeast Asia aimed at raising funds for charity.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Highway Program is launched by the Department of
Tourism to tap the country's tourism potential by linking the
country's tourist areas through a national highway system, from
the northern city of Laoag, via Manila, to Davao in the south.
</P>
<P>
The program will also cover "scenic spot" portions of the
highway to "showcase the splendor and beauty" of the local
landscape, as well as its tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
To further promote the program, the Department of Tourism will
also be undertaking in April a Freedom Trail tour of
underprivileged youth to the part of the highway in Bulacan
province near Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
This project will not only have the youth based in different
orphanages to a historical guided tour of the province but will
also have them participate in games, lectures on nationalism and
positive values and sharing of gifts.
</P>
<P>
For the annual Summer Caravan, the department, the Philippine
Motor Association and the other concerned units will be holding
the Tourism Highway Caravan to Vigan province in May.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth Session of the Eighth
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
China's top advisory body, concluded here today.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, made a
speech at the closing meeting. He said members have offered many
valuable views and suggestions under the spirit of democracy,
pragmatic approach, unity and the desire to encourage enterprise.
</P>
<P>
"China's reform, opening up and modernization drive are great
pioneering undertakings," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are assuming heavy responsibilities. With the solid
foundation laid by our revolutionary predecessors, the scientific
theory initiated by Deng Xiaoping and the basic line for the
primary stage of socialism, under the leadership of the CPC
Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at its core and through the
concerted efforts of hundreds of millions of the Chinese people,
China will be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles and
advance triphantly along the path of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics," he said.
</P>
<P>
Today's closing meeting was attended by 1,773 members.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were also Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao
Shi, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao and Rong Yiren.
</P>
<P>
The meeting adopted a Political Resolution of the Fifth Session

</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan called the reform and opening up and modernization
drive a great creative cause. The great and arduous task facing
the Chinese people is to fulfill the objectives set forth in the
government work report of Premier Li Peng and in the outlines of
the Ninth Five-Year Plan for national economic and social
development and the long-range objectives to the year 2010, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We now enjoy favorable conditions, and an unequaled
opportunity is at hand," he said. "We should make the best use of
this time and immerse ourselves in hard work."
</P>
<P>
Thanks to reform and opening up during the past 18 years,
China's productive forces have expanded greatly, the overall
strength of the state has noticeably increased, the standard of
living has gone up remarkably and the whole country has been
revitalized, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"However, we must be aware that we have a huge population, a
poor economic foundation, insufficient per capita resources and
disparate regional development," he said.

<P>
Li said that, at present, the Chinese society as a whole is in
unity and stability, but there are also a number of factors
hampering unity and affecting stability.
</P>
<P>
"We must face reality, assume responsibilities, concern
ourselves and whole-heartedly with the weal and woe of the people,
do our utmost to resolve problems, and do patient and painstaking
ideological work. This is an important basis for maintaining unity
and stability," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that, in order to maintain unity and stability, it is
most important to closely rally round the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and hold high the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The Political Resolution noted that the Fifth Session of the
Eighth CPPCC National Committee agreed to the Government Work
Report made by Premier Li Peng, as well as the "Report on the
Implementation of the 1996 Plan for National Economic and Social
Development and on the draft 1997 Plan for National Economic and
Social Development."
</P>
<P>
It also affirmed new achievements in the past year scored by
people of all ethnic groups across the country in reforms, opening
up and modernization drive, by adhering to the guidance of Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and under the leadership of the Party Central
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
It said that the session called on all parties, patriotic
figures without party affiliation, people's organizations, and
representatives of all ethnic groups and social strata that have
participated in people's political consultations, to carry work
forward at the behest of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and, under the
staunch leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade
Jiang Zemin at the core, hold high the great banner of Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, perform their duties of political consultation,
democratic supervision and involvement in running state affairs,
do a better job in promoting the grand unity and alliance of the
Chinese nation, and strive to build China into a socialist modern

of civilizization.
</P>

Li acknowledged that China's per capita GNP is still at a
relatively lower level as compared with that of some developing
countries, not to mention developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"All countries are now dedicated to accelerating their economic
development, and international economic and technological
competition is becoming increasingly intensified," he said. "If we
fail to redouble our efforts to develop our economy, the gap will
widen further. We once wasted much precious time and missed quite
a number of opportunities for development, we cannot afford any
delay."
</P>
<P>
Li cited the year 1997 as "an important year in the history of
China." During the year, he said, China will resume the exercise
of its sovereignty over Hong Kong and the Chinese Communist Party
will convene its 15th National Congress.
</P>
<P>
"These two major events are drawing worldwide attention. They
inspire us and are of far-reaching significance for the overall
situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to note that the smooth accomplishment of these
major tasks requires the joint efforts of all Chinese people to do
their work well in all fields, and particularly in safeguarding
the situation characterized by unity and stability.

<P>
KATHMANDU, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's new Prime Minister
Lokendra Bahadur Chand and his cabinet today took the oath of
office in the presence of King Birendra at the Royal Palace here,
a communique of the palace said.
</P>
<P>
Chand, parliamentary leader of the National Democratic Party
(RPP), was appointed prime minister Monday by the king after he
submitted a petition to form a coalition government with majority
parliamentary support.
</P>
<P>
The petition was signed by 103 MPs in the 205-seat lower house,
including 90 of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML), 10 of Chand's RPP party, 2 of the Nepal
Goodwill Party (NSP) and one from another small party.
</P>
<P>
The new government will replace the outgoing one led by Sher
Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress (NC), which resigned last
week after losing a confidence vote in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Deuba coalition government failed to win majority support
in the lower house Thursday as an RPP faction led by Chand and the
NSP party withdrew from the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Chand's eight-member cabinet, announced just hours before
today's swearing-in ceremony, includes four from the CPN-UML, two
from the RPP and two from the NSP.
</P>
<P>
The three-party government led by Chand has to secure a
confidence vote in the lower house of parliament within one month
in accordance with the country's constitution.

<HEADLINE> ADB Offers Vietnam Loan of 1.4 billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
offered Vietnam a preferential loan of 1.4-1.5 billion
U.S. dollars in the coming years, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The offer was made by Robert May, deputy director of the ADB's
Department of Agriculture and Social Affairs, during his meeting
here with Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
May said the loan offered to Vietnam would be delivered from
1997 to 2000, to be allocated to economic infrastructure (40
percent), social infrastructure (25 percent), agriculture, rural
development and natural resources (25 percent), and finance,
industry and other fields (10 percent).
</P>
<P>
He said the ADB also planned to aid Vietnam with 35 technical
support projects totaling 27.5 million U.S. dollars in the next
three years, including 14 projects with a combined capital of 9.5
million U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The ADB official expressed his concern for slow disbursement of
the ADB loans to Vietnam. Up to date, Vietnam has drawn only 123
million U.S. dollars out of the 1.006 billion U.S. dollars credit
capital already approved by the ADB.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese deputy prime minister reiterated Vietnam's
demand for capital from now to the year 2000, especially that for
communications, education, public health care, agriculture and
rural development.

<HEADLINE> Sharp Increase in Tuberculosis Cases in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- There has been a sharp increase
in tuberculosis cases in the country with over 14 million people
suffering from the disease, said the union ministry of health in
its latest report.
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 people die of the TB each year. In New Delhi,
capital of India, over 200,000 TB cases were detected this year in
government hospitals alone.
</P>
<P>
A look at the all-India figures shows that while 1.2 million
new cases were detected last year the number has risen to 1.5
million this year.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned that the number would rise further due to
environmental pollution and spread of AIDS in the country. In
fact, around 60 percent of AIDS patients in India have
tuberculosis.

<HEADLINE> Stock-listing in Shenzhen Stock Market Gains Speed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- So far 24 companies has been
listed with Shenzhen Stock Exchange this year, lifting the total
number to 261, up more than 10 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
The stock listings, together with another six stock issues,
raised nearly five billion yuan in the market.
</P>
<P>
With its biggest ever stock issue quota of ten billion yuan for
this year, China is determined to quickly expand its two stock
markets.
</P>
<P>
Large- and medium-sized state enterprises were encouraged to
list on the stock markets.
</P>
<P>
As a result, newcomers this year to the Shenzhen stock market
included the nation's top producers of carbamide, chemical fiber,
bearings, and paper.
</P>
<P>
"These industrial giants increase Shenzhen market's appeal to
investors, and enable it to play an even more important role in
national economy," said a local stock analyst.
</P>
<P>
The stock market in Shenzhen kept climbing this year in spite
of the pressure the accelerated listings brought. The composite
index on Shenzhen Stock Exchange finished at 3,957.20 points
Wednesday, the highest for this year.
</P>
<P>
"This promising sign comes not just as a result of a
better-performing national economy, it demonstrated a widespread
confidence in the future of the market," said the analyst.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Hold Peace Talks with Tribal Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The much-awaited fourth round of
peace talks between the government of Sheikh Hasina and the tribal
rebels of the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) will take place here
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The talks, aimed at achieving a breakthrough in ending the
decades-old bush-war in the CHT, will be held between the National
Committee on CHT and the Parbattya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity
(PCJSS), the political wing of the autonomy-seeking armed rebels.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to pick up the unresolved issues of
land rights and expulsion of Muslim settlers on which the talks
bogged down on January 25-27 in the capital Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
These were included in the five-point demand containing 49
issues tabled earlier by the PCJSS delegation which also demands a
regional assembly for the CHT which has an area of 14,200 square
kilometers bordering India and Burma.
</P>
<P>
The progress made in the previous talks and a breakthrough
achieved on the lingering issue of repatriation of 50,000 tribal
refugees from the Indian state of Tripura brought a hope that a
comprehensive solution could be found to the unresolved issues,
said local observers.
</P>
<P>
However, two unpleasant incidents at Bandarban district on
February 15 and 16, in which three police men and a soldier were
gunned down by unidentified radical tribesmen, cast a little
shadow on the peace process in the CHT, they added.

<HEADLINE> Hostage Released By Kidnappers in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- After 27 days in captivity, a
kidnap victim was freed today by his abductors in an undisclosed
area in Tacurong, Sultan Kudarat province, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Thin and unshaven due to his month-long ordeal, Rogelio Alonzo,
53, a resident of Tacurong, was fetched by his brother and a
doctor from the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
A close relative of the Alonzos said the victim was released
after his family paid an amount of some 200,000 pesos (7,633 U.S.
dollars) as ransom.
</P>
<P>
Alonzo was very weak and in a state of shock. His brother
thanked all those who gave morale support and offered prayers for
the safety of Alonzo. Meanwhile, he emphasized that the release of
Alonzo was a result of the family's private negotiations with the
kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
The victim was taken hostage last February 12 by four armed men
in a billiard hall located near his residence.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are still two real estate developers from the
city of Tacurong who remained in the hands of their abductors.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 41 kidnapping cases had happened in the

<HEADLINE> Government Advisors Urged to Work Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference National Committee, the
country's top advisory body, were urged here today to work even
harder.
</P>
<P>
"We should always remain sober-minded, be conscious of the
heavy responsibilities we bear, emancipate our minds, be
innovative, make the best use of our time and work hard year after
year and generation after generation, and never slacken our
efforts," Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee,
said this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing meeting of the fifth session of the
Eighth CPPCC National Committee, Li said that the great and
arduous task facing the Chinese people is to fulfill the
objectives set forth in the government work report of Premier Li
Peng and in the outline of the Ninth Five-Year Plan for national
economic and social development and the long-range objectives to
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
"We now enjoy favorable conditions, and an unequaled
opportunity is at hand," he said. "We should make the best use of
this time and immerse ourselves in hard work."
</P>
<P>
Thanks to reform and opening up during the past 18 years,
China's productive forces have expanded greatly, the overall
strength of the state has noticeably increased, the standard of
living has gone up remarkably and the whole country has been
revitalized, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"However, we must be aware that we have a huge population, a
poor economic foundation, insufficient per capita resources and
disparate regional development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li added that China's per capita GNP is still very low compared
with some developing countries, not to mention developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
"All countries are now speeding up their economic development,
and international economic and technological competition is
becoming increasingly intenser," he said. "If we fail to redouble
our efforts to develop our economy, the gap will widen further. We
once wasted much precious time and missed many opportunities for
development, we cannot afford any delay."
</P>
<P>
At present, the Chinese economy is experiencing a sustained,
rapid and sound development and much has been achieved in the
effort to improve economic macro-controls, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that measures for reform have been introduced steadily
and social stability maintained.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, our social and economic development is
going smoothly," he said.
</P>
<P>
While affirming the achievements, Li said that China still
faces many problems and difficulties, citing a still irrational
economic structure, a weak agricultural foundation, tens of
millions of people still living in poverty, state-owned
enterprises plagued by considerable difficulties, and increasing
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"These knotty problems affect the overall situation and we
cannot afford to let them drag on," he noted.
</P>
<P>
To solve all these problems calls for various efforts and
measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
He continued: "The most important is to make the best use of
our time and to work hard," Li said. "Through hard work we can
come up with good ideas and practicable methods, accomplish
successes and gain experience. Through hard work, we can surmount
difficulties and blaze new trials. If we fail to work hard, we
will accomplish nothing.
</P>
<P>
"Revolutionaries of the older generation enjoined us to work
hard... and to work diligently has been what the CPC Central
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has consistently
required of us. And it is our fine tradition and the spirit of the
Chinese nation. We should develop this spirit in our effort to
build socialism with Chinese characteristics."

<HEADLINE> CPPCC National Committee Chairman Stresses Unity, Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Members of China's top advisory
body are called on to "rally closely round the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core
and hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics."
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the call
today before the CPPCC's annual session ended.
</P>
<P>
Li cited the year 1997 as "an important year in the history of
China." During the year, he said, China will resume the exercise
of its sovereignty over Hong Kong and the Chinese Communist Party
will convene its 15th National Congress.
</P>
<P>
"These two major events are drawing worldwide attention. They
inspire us and are of far-reaching significance for the overall
situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the smooth accomplishment of these major tasks
requires the joint efforts of all Chinese people to do their work
in all fields, and in particular, in safeguarding the situation
characterized by unity and stability.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, Chinese society is, as a whole, in unity
and stability. However, there are still some factors that impair
unity and stability.
</P>
<P>
"We will never neglect or dodge these things, handle them
perfunctorily or shirk our responsibility," he added.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that "we must face reality, assume
responsibilities and be sincerely and wholeheartedly concerned
ourselves with the weal and woe of the people. We must do our
utmost to resolve various problems and do patient and painstaking
ideological work. This is an important basis for maintaining unity
and stability."
</P>
<P>
"To maintain unity and stability," he stressed, "it is
imperative to rally closely round the CPC Central Committee with
Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core and hold high the great banner of
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics."
</P>
<P>
By adhering to this theory resolutely, creatively and in
all-round way and in compliance with the historical trend and the
people's common aspirations, China will become powerful and
prosperous, its people will lead a happy life and its society will
enjoy a long-term stability, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said that "in
maintaining unity and stability, it is imperative to take overall
interests into account and have a tremendous sense of historic
responsibility."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he acknowledged, the situation at present has been
won through hard and arduous efforts.
</P>
<P>
He concluded his speech by calling on the people throughout
China to unite as one and work together to create a still more
beautiful and splendid future.

<HEADLINE> Studio of Famous Poet Preserved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 12 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan Province has
earmarked more than two million yuan in the past decade for
conservation of the studio of a famous poet from the Northern Song
Dynasty (960-1127).
</P>
<P>
The Studio, Dongpo Shuyuan, in the western coast of Hainan is
one of the four historical sites in the province under state
protection.
</P>
<P>
It was where Su Dongpo, a famous poet and a minister in the
Northern Song Dynasty, pursued academic studies during his exile
to Hainan, which was ancient China's equivalent to Siberia.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, the province has renovated some 20 buildings and
planted nearly 100 kinds of trees over one and a half hectares in
the compound.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 cultural relics related to the poet, including
stone tablets, ceramics, paintings, calligraphy, and historical
documents, have been collected by the studio in the recent years.
</P>
<P>
The studio attracts some 160,000 tourists every year from both
at home and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Watchdog to Take Criminal Action Against Nomura </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Securities and Exchange
Surveillance Commission has decided to take criminal action
against Nomura Securities Co. on suspicion of violating the
nation's securities and exchange law, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The company made public Thursday that it had provided a real
estate firm connected with former Sokaiya corporate racketeer with
70 million yen (583,000 U.S. dollars) in illicit payments.
</P>
<P>
The Yomiuri Shimbun, a leading Japanese daily, reported that
the securities market watchdog concluded that Nomura itself made
money through dealings of the two former executives, who were
allegedly directly involved in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
The executives -- Shimpei Natsuki, who was in charge of
equities, and Nobutaka Fujikura, who was in charge of
administrative affairs -- resigned Monday.
</P>
<P>
The commission found that the two conducted the illicit deals
in the belief that they were part of the company business while
the company was aware of the illegal activity immediately after it
started but chose to ignore it, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The watchdog is now wrapping up its investigation of the
incident and is preparing to start criminal action, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to an in-house investigation by Nomura, the firm
diverted a total of about 70 million yen in profits to Tokyo-based
Kojin Building real estate firm between March 1993 and September
1996 on at least five occasions. The real estate firm is run by a
younger brother of a 53-year-old former racketeer.
</P>
<P>
Nomura has insisted that all the dealings with Kojin Building
were done solely by Fujikura, who received the request from the
firm, and Matsuki, who oversaw the deals. The leading brokerage
firm denies being systematically involved in the deals in any way.
</P>
<P>
The commission also discovered that three corporate departments
were involved in deals, which ranged from opening an account to
manipulating the stocks and bonds for Kojin Building, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, five trust banks in Japan have
decided to suspend their business with Nomura because of the
scandal.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Naval Ships Attract Thousands of Hawaiians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONOLULU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- More than five thousand
Hawaiians poured into the Pearl Harbor to see the visiting Chinese
naval vessels.
</P>
<P>
Harbin and Zhuhai, the two guided missile destroyers, and
Nanchang, the oiler, arrived here Sunday for a five-day visit,
which was the first in eight years by Chinese naval warships.
</P>
<P>
The two destroyers, berthing in parallel and decorated with
Chinese and American national flags and colorful banners, were
open to visitors on Monday and Tuesday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
Side by side are USS Ingersoll and three other U.S. destroyers.
</P>
<P>
Visitors came from Honolulu and other Hawaiian cities, and some
made the special trip even from the U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
Many of them chatted with Chinese sailors, asked them questions
and took pictures with them. They seemed to be impressed not only
by the ships but also by the goodwill of the visit.
</P>
<P>
"It's a unique experience for me and I'm happy that the Chinese
ships would have come to visit the United State," said Ray Eckert
who came here with his daughter. "Exchange of such visits can
further mutual understanding and benefit both countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Children were the most curious visitors. Fourth grader Jason
Copder said that the Chinese ships were much bigger than he and
his classmates expected, and said that he would go to see China
someday.
</P>
<P>
Most visitors from the local Chinese community took their
families to see the vessels, whose names are familiar to older
people of the Chinese origin. They explained to their children
that Harbin is the capital of a northeast China province while
Zhuhai is a coastal city in the south.
</P>
<P>
Many tried to find sailors who came from where their ancestors
used to live.
</P>
<P>
At the welcoming ceremony on Monday, Admiral Archie Clemins,
Commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, mentioned, in
particular, Americans of Chinese ancestry who he said "give us
strong emotional ties."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, bands of both navies offered a
concert on the lawn.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese navy band and singers gave the audience and their
U.S. counterparts a pleasant surprise by playing music and singing
American songs.
</P>
<P>
One American musician recognized a friend in the Chinese band
who had a picture taken with him when they first met in Qingdao, a
city in eastern China, during a visit by U.S. naval ships more
than 10 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Sector Issues Stocks for Sustainable Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China's fast-growing tourism
industry has been issuing shares on domestic and overseas stock
markets to ensure sustainable development, according to the China
National Tourism Administration (CNTA).
</P>
<P>
In 1996 over a dozen tourism companies were listed on the
Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, Feng Zongsu, Director of
CNTA's Policy and Law Department, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The listed tourism companies include comprehensive tourism
conglomerates, hotels, travel agencies, scenic spots, and hotel
management firms, covering almost all sectors of the industry,
Feng noted.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan Tourism Co. is among over 30 companies newly
approved by the central government authorities to issue shares on
the overseas stock market. It is also the first tourism company to
get the privilege.
</P>
<P>
Soliciting funds from the stock market is a new trend for
China's tourism sector, which over the past few years has
witnessed a growth rate higher than the average national economy
by attracting huge financing from the government, social
organizations, and private foreign investors, Feng observed.
</P>
<P>
Last year, overseas tourist arrivals to China topped 51.1
million and the country's foreign tourism foreign exchange
earnings reached 10.2 billion US dollars for the first time.
</P>
<P>
"The expansion of the industry through the stock market is not
only a new way of fund-raising, but instrumental to setting up
scientific management and operation systems, further raising
economic returns, and improving the overall level of the
industry," Feng said.

JINAN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Fingers tapping nimbly over the
keyboard, Li Hongru e-mails the species, quantities and prices of
more than 180 flowers and plants through his computer.
</P>
<P>
In an instant, the information reaches his clients worldwide
linked by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongru is no technician but a farmer-turned manager in Luli
Village, Huanglou Township of Qingzhou City in east China's
Shandong province. "what makes me win out in the competitive
market is this little box," he told Xinhua reporters, pointing to
his Pentium PC.
</P>
<P>
Li, however, is not the only farmer who's gone on-line. As
China dives into the information era, an increasing portion of its
farmers are testing the waters of the wide cybernetic sea.
</P>
<P>
Program-controlled phones, cellular phones, fax machines and
even PCs -- circulating freely on China's fringe, especially in
the coastal provinces and cities -- have been gradually becoming
major tools to guide production and management activities for
farmers.
</P>
<P>
In tune with the information age, Chinese farmers have opted to
use the state-of-the art telecommunications and electronic media
as an indispensable means to get rich rather than a decoration to
show off, said Fan Hongshan, an economist with the State Economic
Restructuring Commission.
</P>
<P>
Ren Dexiang, a villager in the mountainous Nanshili Township of
Laizhou city, Shandong Province runs a good business with his
1.4-hectare cherry orchard. He consults with agro-experts and
contacts shops on his 10,000 yuan cellular phone-- a price many
townsfolk viewed as "too expensive."
</P>
<P>
"The Big Brother [cellular phone] is very cost-effective. Using
information I got on the phone has already saved me over 20,000
yuan," said Ren, with an air of excitement.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Bangabandhu Murder Case Begins in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The trial of the much-talked
Bangabandhu murder case began today at the Dhaka district court
amid tight security.
</P>
<P>
Bangabandhu Mujibur Rahman, the first president of Bangladesh
and farther of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was killed along
with most of his family members in a military coup on August 15 in
1975.
</P>
<P>
For holding the trial of the case, all necessary papers and
documents have been sent to the makeshift court.
</P>
<P>
Six persons were brought to court for trial. They are former
state minister Taheruddin Thakur, Col.(retd) Syed Rahman,
Lt-Col.(retd) Shahriar Khan, Lt-Col.(retd) Mohiuddin, Honorary
Captain (retd) Wahab and Zobaida Rashid, wife of Col. (retd)
Khandaker Rashid, an absconding accused.
</P>
<P>
The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) submitted the
chargesheet of the case on January 15 after three and a half
months of investigation.
</P>
<P>
There are another 17 fugitives in the case. However, 13 of them
are absconding abroad and the other four have already died.
</P>
<P>
During the investigation, CID personnel had interrogated at
least 700 people, including ministers, politicians, former and
present military officials and civil servants.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the government of Sheikh Hasina, who took
power last June, parliament passed an indemnity (repeal) bill on
November 12, 1996, lifting the ban to hold the trial of the
Bangabandhu murder case.
</P>
<P>
The district court has the jurisdiction to award capital
punishment or life sentence (30 years) if the accused are found
guilty.

While nouveau-riche like Ren use Big Brothers, a larger number
of Chinese farmers arm themselves with pagers, which rattle the
bumpy village roads and link up townships.
</P>
<P>
"With my little Motorola pager, information comes quickly and
business is more convenient," said Zeng Qiongshou, a construction
worker from Yaojiang Township, Longnan County of east China's
Jiangxi Province. Longnan County alone now has set up three pager
stations.
</P>
<P>
In central China's Hubei Province, rural telephone clients are
increasing at a rate of 150,000 per year, up from 100,000 in
1993. And in Tangxing, a township of 30,000 residents on the
Yellow River Delta in north China, 180 rural families have
installed fax machines in their homes.
</P>
<P>
Engaged ladies prefer wedding dowries like program-controlled
phones to traditional items like refrigerators and color TVs.
</P>
<P>
Modern telecom and electronic media let Chinese farmers take
the pulse of the ever-changing market, and helps them time their
planting of cash-crops: grapes, apples, pears and pepper and
prevents fruits and vegetables from rotting prematurely.
</P>
<P>
With computers becoming a hit in the countryside, Chinese
authorities are organizing training courses for the rural
population. Five hundred computer schools are to be opened in
China's outback, in which 500,000 peasants are expected to be
trained in operating computers, according to officials of the
China Cultural Poverty-Relief Committee.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists expect the trend to gain momentum among savvy
Chinese peasants, which will uplift the living standards of rural
residents.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Annual Session Acclaimed (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The last session of China's top
advisory body of the current term, the Eighth National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
concluded today.
</P>
<P>
Beijing media have commended it as a conference of democracy
with an enterprising spirit. Hong Kong media and foreign news
services commented that the session, together with that of the
country's legislature, has sent a strong message that China will
persist in carrying out reform and open polices.
</P>
<P>
The session the CPPCC National Committee is convened soon after
the death of Deng Xiaoping, who worked as chairman of the CPPCC
National Committee from 1979 to 1982. Deng is widely acclaimed as
the founder of the people's consultative system in the new period.
</P>
<P>
During the session lasting 13.5 days, CPPCC National Committee
members have cherished the outstanding feats by Deng Xiaoping and
vowed to push ahead with socialist reform and modernization
initiated by Deng Xiaoping. Observers say the session has been
filled with an enterprising spirit, a spirit of "turning grief
(over the death of Deng Xiaoping) into strength."
</P>
<P>
"It is the result of unity and strong leadership of the Party
Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core as well as the
country's political and social stability," said a member.
</P>
<P>
"I'm more confident with the third generation leadership of the
Communist Party of China and China's future," said Huang Sen,
vice-chairman of the Subcommittee of Cultural and Historical Data
of CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Before the current session, some of the non-Communist parties
had reshuffled their leadership. The new generation of leaders of
these non-Communist parties say they will adhere to the
multi-party cooperation and political consultative system under
the leadership of the CPC and have more involvement in the running
of state affairs.

<P>
During the session, all the Standing Committee members of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and 11 senior
leaders of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council took
part in panel discussions of CPPCC National Committee members, the
most in number.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 400 written speeches and more than 2,500
proposals were presented at the session, both a record in number.
Agricultural development, state-owned enterprises, economic
progress in the interior areas, cultural and ethical progress, and
building a clean and honest government are the focus of proposals
raised by the members.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in the number of proposals means that the
government is willing to adopt suggestions and respects the
democratic consultation system and, as a result, members are more
enthusiastic in participating in the running of state affairs,"
said a member of China Association for Promoting Democracy Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong question has been among the most-talked-about
subjects during the session. Official sources said many proposals
on Hong Kong's smooth transition and the smooth transfer of power
there have been adopted by the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
"The government is more trustworthy and we have seen clearly
the bright prospect of the country," said a CPPCC member from Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the conclusion of the session, members said they will
contribute more to the two important events this year -- the
return of Hong Kong and the convocation of the 15th Party
Congress.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches, members also emphasized the importance of
social and political stability. "Stability is of overriding
importance, and I am for it," said Zhang Xianliang, a noted
writer.

<HEADLINE> NPC Strengthens Supervision over Law Enforcement (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Qu Geping, chairman of the NPC Environment and Resources
Protection Committee, said that during their inspection on the
enforcement of the environmental protection law in Beijing,
Tianjin and Shanghai last year, legislators received phone calls,
letters and visits from more than 5,000 people, and solved a
considerable number of problems.
</P>
<P>
Last year in Beijing, the Shougang Iron and Steel Company was
put under media exposure for problems of pollution, as a result of
the legislators' inspection.
</P>
<P>
"The inspection has also added momentum to amending existing
environment laws and regulations and promoted the enactment of new
environmental laws, such as a law on the prevention and control of
noise pollution," Qu added.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the NPC Standing Committee took a rare move to bring
to task financial departments for diverted use of budgeted capital
for securities trading, which was also reported by the press.
</P>
<P>
"Supervision by people's congresses is achieving increasingly
conspicuous results," said Jiang Xiaoke, an NPC deputy from
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Legislators from east China's Zhejiang Province said that
several years ago the Zhejiang Provincial People's Congress set up
a system to monitor the performance of officials selected and
appointed by people's congresses, which has now been introduced to
a dozen provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions across
the country.
</P>
<P>
"The system has helped expose and dismiss a number of corrupt
or incompetent officials, and effectively promoted the building of
clean and efficient governments, courts and procuratorates," they
noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people's congresses have also exercised effective
supervision over administrative and judicial departments by
placing emphasis on people's complaints made through phone calls,
letters and visits.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the NPC Standing Committee alone has
received more than 10,000 visitors and handled over 76,000 letters
of complaints, and has urged administrative and judicial
departments to correct a number of erroneous decisions and solve
some urgent problems for the general public.
</P>
<P>
In order to systemize and legalize the supervisory work of
people's congresses, the NPC Standing Committee recently has set
up a panel to draft a law on supervision.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- People's congresses at all levels
across China have attached greater importance to and actively
exercised supervision over law enforcement, playing a key role in
boosting the rule of law in China.
</P>
<P>
Legislators here attending the Fifth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, agreed that
supervision over law enforcement has great realistic significance
for the fight against local and departmental protectionism, and
for a thorough enforcement of laws.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the NPC Standing Committee carried out an inspection
of the enforcement of Agriculture Law enacted in 1993. A report on
this inspection has been submitted for deliberation at the current
NPC session.
</P>
<P>
Lu Zixiu, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the
Provincial People's Congress of Anhui, east China, said that last
year farmers in some places in Anhui were charged with
unreasonable fees that far exceeded the maximum limit as set by
the State Council, China's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
While the State Council had required that farmers' economic
burden should not exceed 5 percent of their income of the previous
year, some Anhui farmers last year had to pay as much as 30
percent of their earnings.
</P>
<P>
After the inspection team of the NPC Standing Committee visited
the province and raised the issue, Lu said, the Standing Committee
of the provincial people's congress came out with special
regulations on the management of farmers' burden, which stipulate
that anyone who charges farmers with illegal fees receive
administrative punishment, and even face legal suits.
</P>
<P>
"Such kind of regulations was unprecedented across the
country," Lu noted.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the NPC Standing Committee has
organized 51 similar inspections. In 1996 alone, the Committee
sent 21 teams headed by eight vice-chairmen to inspect the
enforcement of laws relating to environmental protection, labor,
education, public security and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Yang Haibo, vice-chairman of the Education, Science, Culture
and Public Health Committee of the NPC, said that inspectors on
education law enforcement seriously criticized governments in some places
where educational input failed to reach the level required by the
law.

<P>
TARIM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Tazhong No.4 Oilfield built in
northwest China's Tarim Basin went operational early this month.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the oilfield produces 5,000 tons of
crude a day, which is sent to Korla City through a 500-km-long
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield, located in the hinterland of the Taklimakan
Desert, was discovered in 1992 and proved to have 35.7 sq km of
oil-bearing strata, with a verified oil reserve of 93 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Oil workers started trial exploration in 1994 at the oilfield,
designed to have an annual production capacity of two million tons
of crude oil. Over the past two years, they have sunk 40 oil wells
at the oilfield.
</P>
<P>
Tazhong No.4 Oilfield is the fifth oilfield ever built in Tarim
Basin which now has a combined annual production capacity of 4.4
million tons of crude oil.

cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Yeltsin said the two countries have lived
through a stage of mutual distrust. Now they had every
opportunity to develop bilateral cooperation, especially in the
fields of politics, economy and trade, Itar-Tass news agency

<HEADLINE> New TV Maker Confident despite Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Irico, China's largest kinescope
producer, redefined itself as a maker of TV sets under its own
brandname.
</P>
<P>
The company believes they can grab a share of the TV market
despite cutthroat competition.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Guang, vice president of Irico Group, even
though the TV ownership has hit 80 percent in China's urban areas,
the ownership is only 17 percent in the country's vast rural
areas. "Remember China has about 400 million households, of which
about 80 percent are in rural areas," he added.
</P>
<P>
Besides the rural market, "the period between 1996 and 2000, we
forecast, will be a peak time for Chinese consumers to replace old
TV models," Li commented.
</P>
<P>
To tap the potential, the company has taken over two TV makers
in Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi and renovated the production
facilities and product mix in accordance with its own development
program.
</P>
<P>
The group is expected to turn out one million units of color or
black-and-white TVs with the screen width from 11cm to 76cm, thus
becoming one of China's top five TV makers. By the end of the
Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), its annual color TV and
display production capacity could reach three million units.
</P>
<P>
Irico ranks as one of China's largest electronic companies. Its
products range from kinescopes, video display terminals, telecom

<HEADLINE> Conviction, Punishment according to Law - New Principle for China's Criminal Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The incorporation of the
principle of conviction and punishment according to law in draft
amendments to China's Criminal Law signals a major change for the
17-year-old criminal code.
</P>
<P>
It also means the abolition of "by analogy" practices in
criminal proceedings, experts here say, adding that the change
will provide a stronger legal guarantee for citizens' personal
freedom and rights and a solid legal basis for judicial organs to
punish criminals.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments are now under review by deputies to the
National People's Congress (NPC) in session since March 1.
</P>
<P>
The practice of "by analogy" means, experts explain, that after
standard legal procedures, an offense that is not defined by the
criminal law can be dealt with by analogizing it to a crime that
is nearest in nature to it, as defined in the law.
</P>
<P>
The new principle of conviction and punishment according to law
will, however, rules out any conviction outside the scope of the
criminal code.
</P>
<P>
China's present criminal code, with 192 articles and 103
specific provisions, was enacted 17 years ago, said Wang Zuofu, a
professor of law from the Law School of the People's University of
China.
</P>
<P>
Although the criminal code was enacted under the principle of
conviction and punishment according to law, it contains a strict
stipulation on conviction and punishment by analogy aimed
exclusively at dealing with crimes that are not clearly defined in
the code.
</P>
<P>
The existing law stipulates that each conviction by analogy
must be applied for permission from the Supreme People's Court, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Experts say conviction and punishment by analogy was seldom
practiced in actual trials.
</P>
<P>
Lang Sheng, deputy chief of the Office of Criminal Law of the
Legislative Affairs Committee under the NPC Standing Committee,
said the draft amendments increase the number of specific
provisions from 103 to 345, which clearly and specifically define
all crimes that need to be defined.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that conditions are ripe for the abolition of
the 'by analogy' practice," he observed.
</P>
<P>
Gan Mingxiu, chief judge of the Criminal Court of the Supreme
People's Court, said the new principle will facilitate court
proceedings, and help China achieve its "rule of law" goal.
</P>
<P>
He noted the draft amendments to the Criminal Law indicate that
China has made another major step in promoting democracy and
developing a legal system.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Business Summit Opens in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
here today opened the fist ASEAN business summit, calling on the
business community in the region to continue to enhance efficiency
of economic sectors such as industry, agriculture and service.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) business
community starts to play an important role in economic development
not only in their respective countries and ASEAN, but also at
international level, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Recalling ASEAN's development in political and economic as well
as security fields over the past 30 years, the president said the
business community has been, and will continue to be, reliable
partners of the governments in providing innovative inputs, new
perspectives and views on possible opportunities in the future.
</P>
<P>
"This is a normal phenomena, because successful economic
policies are non-existent without the participation of the
business community," said Soeharto who described the summit as a
historic event.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto hoped ASEAN businessmen can develop new initiatives
for the promotion of small and medium enterprises which have great
potentials for creating employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The concrete support of ASEAN businessmen is also needed to
develop cooperation in the regional growth triangle, he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has three sub-regional growth triangles: the
Indonesia-Malaysia-Singapore growth triangle, the
Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand growth triangle and the east ASEAN
growth area which covers Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said the strategic geographical location of ASEAN and
its abundant economic resources make it a strategic production
basis.
</P>
<P>
He believed that by capitalizing on the existing potential,
ASEAN will become one of the regions with high economic growth in
the world in the decades to come.
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting, which is being attended by some 600
businessmen, including those from non-ASEAN countries, is aimed at
preparing "a map of journey" toward the global market, a spokesman
for the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, the participants will discuss
business opportunities and listen to speeches from ASEAN senior
officials.
</P>
<P>
Five main topics to be discussed at the meeting are food
business and agriculture, automotive industry, finance, franchise
and infrastructure, according to the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1967, ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria, Russia to Introduce Free Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria and Russia have agreed
that the two countries will have free trade as of April this year
and will take concrete measures to eliminate barriers to bilateral
trade.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came as a result of a two-day meeting between
Bulgaria and Russia on cooperation in trade, economic, military
and technological fields which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Bulgaria's Deputy Prime
Minister Aleksander Bozhikov said it would be possible that Russia
continues to supply natural gas to Bulgaria and the latter allows
Russia to lay a natural gas pipeline across Bulgarian territory.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to sign a formal agreement in two
weeks time, allowing Russia to lay a natural gas pipeline through
Bulgaria as part of its 600 million U.S.-dollar pipeline project
through the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Bozhikov said that Russia wants to take part in the
privatization of a car and oil company and Russian companies were
interested in buying Bulgarian tobacco and drugs factories and a
rehabilitation center.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the press conference, Russian Deputy Prime
Minister Oleg Lobov said that Russia would grant Bulgaria 250
million U.S. dollars in loans to help upgrade Kozilodui nuclear
power station and for military equipment.
</P>
<P>
In talks with Bulgarian president Petar Stoyanov, Lobov said
that Bulgaria's bid to join NATO as part of the alliance's
eastward expansion would not affect bilateral relations, even
though Russia is strongly opposed to NATO's plan.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Workers' Living Standards Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 80.6 percent of white- and
blue-collar workers in China's various institutions and
enterprises feel their living standard has made great strides
compared with 10 years ago, according to nationwide survey.
</P>
<P>
Economic Daily reports that last December a nationwide survey
on the livelihood of Chinese staff and workers was jointly
conducted by the State Statistics Bureau, the Ministry of Labor,
the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Ministry of Civil
Affairs, the Ministry of Public Health and the People's Bank of
China.
</P>
<P>
The survey covered 71 cities from 30 provinces, municipalities
and autonomous regions. And a household-to-household sample survey
was carried out in 30,000 urban households which involved 200
million people from 62.5 million households.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, 62.6 percent of the respondents felt that their
living standards rose compared with five years ago, particularly
in terms of wages, bonuses and welfare.
</P>
<P>
The questionnaire, divided into 20 topics, discovered that the
top concerns of staff and workers are social stability, economic
development, social order and anti-corruption.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that the broad masses have gained real
benefits from the reform and opening-up drive which has won their
earnest support. They have full confidence in China's future and
wish to see stability, sustained economic development and the
refinement of social security systems.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Tackle Bad Property Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has decided
to set up a property loan management organization to bail out bad
property loans in a bid to reverse the prolonged property market
slump.
</P>
<P>
According to the government house, the cabinet Tuesday approved
a Finance Ministry proposal to create the government agency which
will involve financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry and the central bank said in a joint
statement released on Tuesday that the organization will be funded
by the government with 1 million baht (40,000 US dollars) and
admission fees not less than 50 million baht (2 million dollars)
from the participating institutions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the body will be allowed to issue
government-guaranteed bonds to collect no more than 100 billion
baht (4 billion US dollars) at the initial stage.
</P>
<P>
The organization will conditionally purchase property loans
from financial institutions with a principle of self-help in the
private sector, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Property loans eligible for purchase by the organization must
be those already in the process of development and their value
must be strictly reappraised.
</P>
<P>
The organization will purchase the troubled loans for no more
than the minimum price valuation or no less than the total
outstanding initial loans.
</P>
<P>
The organization also has the right to refuse to take over high
risk loans.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the oversupply in the Thai property market is
threatening the soundness of the country's financial institutions.
The government hopes that the new body will help strengthen the
property sector.

FUZHOU, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Once the frontier of hostility,
three small islets in the Taiwan Straits now have become a hot
tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
Over 60,000 Chinese and overseas tourists visited the Dadeng,
Xiaodeng and Jiaoyu islets of Fujian Province, where they took a

The three islets, now linked up with Xiamen City by a
newly-built dam road, are the nearest point between the mainland

Attempting to turn the islets into the "back garden of Xiamen",

BUCHAREST, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops should withdraw
from Moldova's breakaway enclave of Trans-Dniestr as soon as
possible, said Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma in Moldovan
capital Chisinau today.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma, who was there on a one-day visit, said Ukraine will
provide facilities for the withdrawing Russian troops when passing
the border. Ukraine is located between Moldova and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma held talks with his Moldovan counterpart Petru Lucinschi
on bilateral relations. The two sides issued a declaration on
establishing a customs union and signed agreements on
strengthening border cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the issue of establishing an

Ukraine and Romania.
</P>
<P>
When the former Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russian troops
stayed on in Moldova to protect the Russian-speaking population in
Trans-Dniestr, an area east of the River Dniestr where ethnic
Russians and Ukrainians issued a unilateral declaration of
independence from largely Romanian-speaking Moldova.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Moscow and Chisinau signed an agreement under which
Russian troops would pull out over three years.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Belarus' President Alexander
Lukashenko restated today that his country could only integrate
with Russia on a basis of equality.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the third joint conference of
Belarus and Russia's parliaments in Minsk, Lukashenko said that to
Belarus, equality was the only standard for union with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Integration based on equality was a feasible way of union of
Belarus and Russia, because it not only tallied with the trend of
integration all over the world, but was also the condition for
raising the level of cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said, the two countries should strengthen
cooperation on economic, social, cultural, scientific and
technical sectors to reach integration aims set in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO)
eastward expansion, Lukashenko said, Belarus opposed its
expansion, for the same reasons as Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said, Belarus and Russia hoped to work together to build a
new security system, taking into account the interests of all
European countries.

<HEADLINE> Poland Opposes to Limited NATO Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs
Dariusz Rosati said today that his country was strongly opposed to
Russia's demand that Poland be a limited member of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Rosati made the remarks when meeting with scholars and students
from the International Relations Institute of Warsaw University.
</P>
<P>
He said that if NATO forces were forbidden to be stationed in
Poland, it would violate the principle that a NATO member could
enjoy the entire rights of the military bloc.
</P>
<P>
He said Poland agreed that NATO would not deploy nuclear
weapons in its new member states, although this was a non-binding
undertaking.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was unnecessary to deploy nuclear weapons in
Poland and other countries which were seeking membership of the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Polish authorities were looking forward to possibly joining
the organization in April, 1999, when NATO marks its 50th
anniversary, Rosati said.

<HEADLINE> Internet-Linked Suicides Raise Concern in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Internet-linked suicide by a
young couple has raised concern in Canada about the growing
problem of how to control what is published on Web sites and how
it can affect people.
</P>
<P>
Those who are not inclined to suicide will never be affected by
the suicide information on the Internet, said Dr. Antoon Leenaars,
a psychiatrist and former president of the Canadian Association
for Suicide Prevention (CASP).
</P>
<P>
"But those who get the message that life is not worth living,
etc., then the Internet will reinforce that tendency," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Canadian police found the bodies of a 21-year-old
Canadian man and a 24-year-old American woman at a downtown hotel
in Toronto. A suicide note said the two met several months ago on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Police believe the couple died of an overdose, using a recipe
of drugs and pills they found on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"Information about how to kill oneself is a growing problem
because it is so easily available in a matter of seconds," said
Dr. Leenaars.
</P>
<P>
The governments may ban books on how to commit suicide, "but
how can they control the Internet," he said.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the police admitted that police lack the
manpower to control the Internet for information on suicide, which
is not illegal in Canada.
</P>
<P>
She noted that what bothers her the most about all the detailed
information on the Internet is that the information is available
to anyone, especially young children who may be depressed because
they broke up with their friends.
</P>
<P>
To counter the information on suicides, the CASP has set up a
Web site on the Internet in which it tries to offer some help to
those contemplating suicide.
</P>
<P>
It contains information on crisis lines, literature and
counselling agencies.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tourist Arrivals Down by 25 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka
dropped by 25 percent last year compared with 1995, according to
the latest figures from the Tourist Board of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that a total of 302,000 tourists visited Sri
 Lanka in 1996, while 402,000 came to the country in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Board blamed the Tamil rebels' attacks in
Colombo such as the bomb blast which destroyed the Central Bank
and the attacks on the oil installations for the decline in
tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's major tourist markets such as Germany, Britain and
France were among the areas that showed a drastic drop.
</P>
<P>
Arrivals from Germany, 79,000 in 1995, fell to 45,000 last
year, a drop of 43 percent. Visitors from UK declined by 18
percent, while visitors from France fell by 30 percent, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
They stated that in an effort to arrest the decline the board
had intensified its promotion campaigns in different parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
The Board's fully fledged office in New Delhi was opened last
year. The board has also set up offices in Frankfort, London and
Paris while there are representation offices in Japan, Thailand
and Ireland, the sources added.

<P>
OTTAWA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada's new motor vehicle sales
declined 6.3 percent to 105,430 units in January from last
December, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, the year of 1997 still started off better than 1996,

</P>
<P>
About the same amount of vehicles were sold this January
compared with January 1994.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth month in a row to record a year-on-year
increase in vehicle sales.

<HEADLINE> Radiation Leak After Fire at Japanese Nuclear Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A small fire and an explosion at a
nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in central Japan on Tuesday has
dealt another blow to the country's nuclear development program.
</P>
<P>
Ten workers were exposed to small amounts of radiation after
the fire on Tuesday morning at the state-run Power Reactor and
Nuclear Fuel Development Corp (Donen) in Tokai, some 115
kilometers northeast of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Ten hours later, at 8.15 p.m., an explosion at the site of the
fire blew out windows in the four-storey building which handles
drums of vitrified nuclear waste. The building was empty at the
time and no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
On both occasions, radiation leaked into the atmosphere, but a
spokesman said there was no need to evacuate the plant or the
nearby area.
</P>
<P>
The 10 workers exposed in the morning inhaled radiation after
the plant's ventilation system failed during the fire, allowing
small amounts of radiation to escape into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
But they were examined and allowed to go home. A company
spokesman said the contamination of the workers was 2,700
becquerels, less than two-thousandths of an employee's permissible
maximum annual intake.
</P>
<P>
After the evening explosion, white smoke billowed from the
windows of the building and a radioactivity monitor alarm went off.
</P>
<P>
One of the radioactivity monitoring posts near the building
showed an increase in radioactivity of 20 percent at 8:50 p.m.,
indicating that a small amount of radiation leaked outside. The
reading returned to normal after 9:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Some 42 employees working in nearby buildings were given
physical examinations, with no abnormal amounts of radiation being
detected, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The two incidents have dealt a further blow to Japan's nuclear
development program. They came on the same day Kyushu Electric
Power Company said it was abandoning a plan to build a nuclear
plant in the southern city of Kushima because of local opposition.
</P>
<P>
They also came just 16 months after a sodium coolant leakage
accident at Donen's prototype fast-breeder reactor Monju in
Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, some 340 kilometers west of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Monju has been shut down since the massive leak of
non-radioactive liquid sodium from pipes forming part of the
secondary cooling system on December 8, 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
meeting today with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said Russia and Israel should iron out distrust and
develop bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Yeltsin said the two countries have lived
through a stage of mutual distrust. Now they had every opportunity
to develop bilateral cooperation, especially in the fields of
politics, economy and trade, Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expressed his concern over Israel's "one-sided action"
in east Jerusalem, and called on the Israeli government to take
measures favorable to the peace and stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president also noted that the trade volume between
the two countries is only worth 500 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who arrived in Russia on Monday for his first
official visit, told reporters before leaving for Moscow that
Israel considered the strengthening relations with Russia was a
priority for Israel, said Tass.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also hoped Moscow would persuade Syrian President
Hafez Assad to resume disrupted talks with Israel, and that
Russian leaders would abandon cooperation with Iran in the field
of nuclear technologies.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, during meeting with
Netanyahu on Tuesday, said Russia would actively push forward the
all-round Palestinian-Israeli and Syrian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister, who is expected to leave Russia on
March 12, also met with his Russian counterpart Viktor
Chernomyrdin on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Ramos: No Deal With Imelda on Marcos' Burial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has categorically denied issuing a written promise to former First
Lady and now Leyte Representative Imelda Marcos to have her late
husband Ferdinand Marcos buried at the Manila Heroes' Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Renato Cayetano said the
President confirmed to him that there was no note given by Ramos
to Imelda about the alleged promise on the burial, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Cayetano's disclosure came a day after House Speaker Jose de
Venecia said he was unaware of any written agreement reached
between the President and Imelda.
</P>
<P>
It was in de Venecia's house in Makati city of Metro Manila
where Ramos, the then President-elect, and Imelda met to discuss
the burial issue in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Imelda claimed recently that Ramos gave her a written promise
to bury her husband at the heroes' cemetery during that meeting.
</P>
<P>
Imelda asked the government to hold a hero's funeral for the
late President after the power supply to Marcos' air-conditioned
mausoleum was cut due to the family's failure to pay power bills.
</P>
<P>
The late President's remains were returned from the United
States in 1993 to his hometown.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo Frei
today called for unity and sustainable economic growth, poverty
alleviation, democracy and free trade among Latin American states.
</P>
<P>
"To have its voice heard in the world, Latin America must
remain united and work for sustainable economic growth, to
overcome poverty and to work for the consolidation of democracy
and the development of free trade," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Frei was speaking over radio stations in Argentina, Bolivia,
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela and Chile on the third
anniversary of his inauguration.
</P>
<P>
He said the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) was the third
most important trading group in the world and, for this reason,
"we will be respected."
</P>
<P>
Mercosur groups Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay. Chile formally established partnership with Mercosur in
October 1996.
</P>
<P>
The president condemned the Helms-Burton Law, a U.S. law aimed
at strengthening economic sanctions against Cuba. He said the act
ran counter to the principle of free trade.
</P>
<P>
On Chile's relations with Bolivia, Frei said the challenge
facing both nations is to open their borders and to look for a
free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
Chile has stood for opening its ports, air and ground
infrastructures for the benefit of its neighboring country, he
added.
</P>
<P>
As for its border problems with Argentina, Frei said that
following the pronouncements and the agreement accepted by the
presidents of both countries, the only thing to do was to wait for
the parliaments of the two countries to speak out.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean president also expressed willingness to collaborate
with Peru and Ecuador to solve their border problems through
talks.

<P>
KUNMING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada will treat central and
western areas of China as important places in future exchanges and
will explore new markets there, said Raymond Chan, Secretary of
State of the Canadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Trade.
</P>
<P>
Chan led a 26-member delegation on a 10-day visit of China at
the invitation of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs that
began on March 3.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark when he met with provincial officials in
Yunnan on Monday. The delegation of six government officials and
20 businessmen, arrived in Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province, on
March 9.
</P>
<P>
In addition to signing agreements of cooperation, the mission
also seeks to better understand the central and western areas, to
enhance exchanges, and to pursue new trade and commercial
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Canada has always kept close ties with China, said Chan, who
noted that by 1996 bilateral trade volume between China and Canada
amounted to six billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Canada hopes that its trade volume with China will surpass 14
billion U.S. dollars by the turn of this century. Therefore,
Canada must make painstaking efforts to open up new market in
China, said Chan.
</P>
<P>
Previously, cooperation between the two countries had been
centered on coastal cities of east China.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that the prospects for Canadian cooperation with
central and western areas of China are bright.

to take on the world of Pierre Cardin and Givenchy, to give boost
to the country's clothing industry, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The clothing industry, one of the country's pillar sector, now
has an estimated 44,000 factories involved in production, with
employees surpassing four million, but it lacks qualified
designers and world-renowned brand clothing names.
</P>
<P>
Last year the industry produced 8.5 billion items of clothing
and earned 25 billion US dollars in foreign exchange from exports,
making both China's garment production and exports rank first in
the world.
</P>
<P>
But by sewing up a pool of highly experienced designers, the
country's clothing industry can do even better, the paper quoted
experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
From this year, the country's designers have to register with
China Garments Designer Association (CGDA). And those who have
obtained professional titles or worked more than two years as
designers can register with CGDA and become its members, according
to association official Song Wenwen.
</P>
<P>
In addition, designers who are either working, studying or
living abroad, can also register with CGDA.
</P>
<P>
The registration plan is expected to help boost the fledgling
clothing design industry in the country, according to industry
observers.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 100 clothing research institutions and two
garment academies nationwide. In addition, more than 40 higher
educational institutions have set up speciality departments on
garments.
</P>
<P>
But a large number of designers are scattered across various
clothing enterprises and it is not known how many designers there
are in China. The designers have no access to relevant information
and guidance, which has hindered the development of the industry.

<HEADLINE> Hungary's Farmers Protest Over Agriculture Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian farmers' protests have
escalated in recent days, involving many farmers across the
country and spreading to the capital.
</P>
<P>
The protests first started two weeks ago among grape growers in
14 counties, following the government's decision to levy a new tax
on growing grapes and producing wine.
</P>
<P>
After the government's refusal to abandon the new tax, protests
have continued. On Tuesday, angry protesters set up large scale
demonstrations on roads across the country.
</P>
<P>
They now demand that the country's overall agricultural policy
be changed and the government resign if Hungary's agricultural
crisis is to be solved.
</P>
<P>
This morning, a large number of protesters drove to the capital
on about 140 tractors.
</P>
<P>
Their demonstration, which was peaceful, culminated in the
protesters handing a petition to Gal Zoltan, president of the
Hungarian National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Overall agricultural production in Hungary has been declining
in recent years, and from 1990 to 1994, the country suffered from
severe agricultural problems.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Fifth seed Iva Majoli of
Croatia went down 7-5, 3-6, 7-5 to 211th-ranked American teenager
Venus Williams in the Evert Cup women's tennis tournament in
Indian Wells, California on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old wild card player has now moved into a
quarter-final clash against Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport of
America, who brushed aside 14th-seeded Ruxandra Dragomir of
Romania 6-2, 6-1 in the third round.
</P>
<P>
The really dramatic moment during the two-hour-and-33-minute
battle occured in the 10th game of the third set with Williams
serving. She faced two match points on her serve in that game,
but saved them both, the second with a 175 kph ace.
</P>
<P>
Majoli looked very exhausted in the 11th game, recording four
straight schoolboy errors to lose her serve at love.
</P>
<P>
Serving in the last game, Williams finally took advantage of
her third match point with an incredible service winner.

<HEADLINE> SEZs to Keep Growth Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China's Special Economic Zones
(SEZs) maintained a good momentum for fast-speed economic growth
last year despite a major policy readjustment, an official in
charge of the SEZs said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ge Hongsheng, director of the Special Economic Zones (SEZs)
Office under the State Council, predicted that the SEZs will keep
up the momentum in the years to come. Ge is attending ongoing
Fifth Session of the Eighth National Congress.
</P>
<P>
To establish pilot areas that would spearhead the economic
development of the whole country, the Chinese government has,
since the early 1980s, designated five special economic zones in
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Hainan, all along China's
more developed southern and eastern coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
The economic zones were granted preferential policies in access
to fund and taxation and some other privileges. To promote fair
competitions in China's endeavor to build a market economy, the
central authorities withdrew the preferences in 1995 so that the
SEZs will compete with other regions on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
A conference on SEZs summoned by the State Council last year,
said Ge, worked out major principles and policies for SEZs'
development in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
He noted the SEZs should continue to give scope to advantages
in their geographical position, and distribution of natural and
human resources, and local industries.
</P>
<P>
These SEZs should, among others, accelerate the reform and
create new advantages in the field of economic managerial system.
At the early stage of their emergence, the SEZs had the biggest
advantages in their structural set-up, which contributed
tremendously to their growth and provided experiences for the
establishment of socialist market economy in China.
</P>
<P>
SEZs should build still a better investment environment not
only in term of urban infrastructure and basic facilities, but in
term of their improved standards in science, education, culture
and physical culture, administrative standards, and the promotion
of legal system and socialist ethical and cultural progress, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ge said SEZs will increase their cooperation with
central and western regions in a joint effort to promote the
common development. New advantages can be brought forth to this
end, as long as their advantages in market, technologies,
technical personnel, funds and information are integrated with
rich natural resources, low-cost labor forces and other relevant
factors in the central and western regions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the former Zhejiang provincial governor said, all
the work in the SEZs should move from the type of being granted
policy preferences to the type of functioning and involve
themselves all the more admist competitions on the fully-equal
conditions.

<HEADLINE> Seaborne Trade Through Myanmar Ports Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The seaborne trade passing through
the ports of Myanmar have been increasing year after year,
reaching an all time high of 7.34 million tons in the 1995-96
fiscal year, official paper The New Light of Myanmar today quoted
Myanmar Minister for Transport Thein Win as saying.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of a seminar on facilitation of
international maritime traffic here on Tuesday, Thein Win also
disclosed that in the last four years, the containerized cargo in
Myanmar grew by 60 to 80 per cent and the growth rate in other
general cargo was between 20 and 40 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Yangon Port, Myanmar's main gateway to the world, handles all
of its imports and over 90 per cent of its exports.
</P>
<P>
The port handled 73,198 containers in 1995-96 up from 44,790 in
1994-95 and over 7.03 million tons of cargo in 1995-96 up from
6.54 million tons in 1993-94, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four container wharves are being built at Thilawa
Port, a newly established one near Yangon Port with investment
from Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The five-day seminar, co-sponsored by the Myanmar Ministry of
Transport, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP),
is being attended by representatives from IMO and ESCAP as well as
Myanmar officials.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Clone Lab Rats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists report that
they "cloned" six laboratory rats from embryo cells last December.
</P>
<P>
This is another report of cloning experiments revealed in
China. A research team cloned a cow from embryonic cells last
April.
</P>
<P>
"The rats were cloned from embryo cells, but not adult, or
mature cells," Prof. Lu Guangxiu, director of the Human
Reproductive Engeneering Lab in Hunan Medical University, told
Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"Our experiment is similar to that of two monkeys cloned by
American scientists last August, but different from that of the
sheep Dolly," said Lu, who led the two-year research work.
</P>
<P>
Lu and her colleagues removed the nucleus from a developing
oocyte from a white rat. Then they assimilated a blastomere, a
cell produced during cleavage, from the 2-8-cell-stage of an
embryo from a black rat.
</P>
<P>
The blastomere was micro-injected into the oocyte and they
fused by chemical methods.
</P>
<P>
The fused cells then was transplanted into the oviduct of the
white rat, the egg provider. The cloned rats were born in two
groups on December 14 and 21 last year.
</P>
<P>
"The cloned rats were almost duplicates of the donor rat,
except one whose hair was brown," Lu said. "This result proved
that the oocyte has imposed impact on the blastomere in some
degree."
</P>
<P>
"We'll make further research of the brown rat," she said.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the experiment will greatly benefit breeds of live
stock, and reproduction of animals on the verge of extinction.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that people need to feel horrified with the
birth of the sheep Dolly," Lu said, referring to the world-wide
panic caused by the first mammal ever cloned from a single adult
cell.
</P>
<P>
Lu, 57, has been involved in human reproductive research for
nearly two decades. Her lab leads in China research of test tube
babies since it was established in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists, who are attending the annual session of the
country's parliament and its top government advisory body in
Beijing, have suggested that legislation is necessary to control
potential dangers that may arise from the cloning technology.

ROME, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Booming tourism could create 382.52
million jobs around the world in the year 2000, a 46 percent
increase on the present number, the World Tourism Organization
(WTO) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The organization said tourism revenues worldwide could be about
1035,980 billion lira (611.23 billion U.S. dollars) by the end of
the century, 10.8 percent more than revenues today.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released days before an international tourism
exhibition opens here on Friday. About 150 holiday planners from
Italy and abroad are expected to attend the fair.
</P>
<P>
Tourism employs 1.7 million Italians, or 10 percent of the
country's labor force.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said Italy is expected to attract 29 million foreign
visitors in 2000, when the flow would be swelled by celebrations
of the Roman Catholic Church's jubilee Holy Year.

<HEADLINE> China To Collect Two New Import Tariffs From July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Two new tariffs will be collected
in China on imports starting on July 1, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper quoted Lin Jiangping, an official
with the Guangzhou Customs Office, as saying that specific duty, a
tariff on the basis of quantity, volume, weight or length of the
goods, will be imposed on beer, crude oil and film.
</P>
<P>
Importers of video recorders and cameras will be required to
pay another tax called compound duty, a tariff based upon specific
duty and ad valorem duty (tariffs on the basis of the goods' sales
value).
</P>
<P>
"it is one step to carry out the State's decision to adopt the
methods starting July 1," Li said, adding China currently
practises ad valorem duty on its imported goods.
</P>
<P>
Existing duties on these products will be phased out to ensure
the general tariff level does not rise.
</P>
<P>
The tariff rate on video recorders will be 60 percent when the
unit price is lower than 3,000 US dollars after tax. The Customs
will levy 1,723 US dollars in specific duty and 3 percent of the
price when the price exceeds the 3,000 US dollars-level.
</P>
<P>
Lin Pointed out that the current ad valorem duty has two
shortcomings, one is that Customs officials have difficulties
assessing the sales value of the imported goods when the price of
the same kind of commodity differs; the other is that the method
is not efficient in protecting domestic industries when foreign
companies dump their goods or when the international price of
imported goods fall; and it cannot prevent tax evasion by
companies reporting a low price for their products.
</P>
<P>
Many countries adopt different kinds of flexible methods to
collect tariffs, the paper says.

<HEADLINE> First London Listing For Chinese Company Due This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The first listing of a Chinese
company on the London Stock Exchange is expected later this month,
"China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper said that the historic move follows
the signing last October of a memorandum of understanding between
the financial authorities of Britain and China.
</P>
<P>
It paves the way for Datang Power Co to be listed on the LSE on
March 21, the China Securities Regulatory Commission Said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Clarke, British Chancellor of Exchequer, as
saying that he expected Datang's debut to mark the beginning of a
series of listings by Chinese companies in London.
</P>
<P>
So far, 23 companies have been listed in Hong Kong, over which
China will resume sovereignty in July, and two in New York.
</P>
<P>
Clarke said at a press conference in Beijing that financial
authorities on both sides have agreed to exchange expertise
through training programs and seminars on securities regulations
and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Berisha Names New Premier for Interim Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha
today appointed Bashkim Fino, a leader from the opposition
Socialist Party to head an all-party interim government.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of Berisha's attempts to restore order in the
country which has been engulfed by violence over the last 10 days
as government troops have clashed with armed rebels protesting
against the president.
</P>
<P>
Fino, a 35-year-old economist, replaced Aleksander Mexsi of
Berisha's right-wing Democratic Party who was forced to resign on
March 1 as unrest erupted in southern Albania.
</P>
<P>
Fino was born in the southern town of Gjirokaster and was its
mayor between 1992 and 1996. The town is now in rebels' hands.
</P>
<P>
Berisha's decision to pick as premier a man from the main
opposition and from the rebel south is seen as a sign of
reconciliation and appeasement to the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still not clear whether the move will satisfy
the rebels, who have seized most part of the south and are
demanding Berisha's resignation.
</P>
<P>
They blame him for the collapse of pyramid investment schemes
earlier this year in which thousands of Albanians lost their life
savings. The collapse sparked widespread unrest and protests
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
These turned violent nearly two weeks ago as rebels in the
south looted army depots and seized weapons to fight the
government.
</P>
<P>
With 12 towns and the country's largest arsenal in their hands,
the rebels are planning to advance toward the capital Tirana.
</P>
<P>
Although rebels from the key southern town of Vlore signed an
Italian-mediated agreement with Berisha to lay down their arms,
other rebels continue to demand the president's resignation before
they hand in their weapons.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 150,000 assault rifles were looted from
barracks during last week's violence. Heavy weapons, such as
tanks, anti-aircraft guns, were also found in the hands of the
ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
In an ominous development, the unrest spread to the north for
the first time Tuesday when some 300 people reportedly broke into
the barracks in Bajram Curri, about 200 kilometers northeast of
Tirana, and looted hundreds of Kalashnikov assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether the looters are pro-south.
</P>
<P>
The crisis forced Berisha to agree on Sunday to form an interim
coalition government to oversee early general elections in June
and grant an amnesty to rebels who hand in their weapons within a
week.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement with 10 opposition parties, the new prime
minister is to be named by Berisha and the deputy prime minister
by the opposition. The other ministries will be divided equally
between the Democrats and opposition parties.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Presidential Palace Committed to Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Presidential Palace
has admitted that it was behind the signature-collecting campaign
for a people's initiative to amend the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Today's local press quoted Press Secretary Hector Villanueva as
saying that the palace would ensure that a people's initiative is
in place so that it could push 97 amendments to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The People's Initiative for Reform, Modernization and Action
should submit to the Commission of Elections some six million
signatures it claimed it has collected during the past few months.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the destruction of some signatures by a water
leak, the body Tuesday declared to cancel the plan and readjusted
the proposed plebiscite on Charter change to June to coincide with
the general registration of voters for the 1998 polls.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos said earlier that there were 97
amendments needed to prepare the Philippines for the 21st century
and its entry into the exclusive club of industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Villanueva said Ramos wanted the Constitution amended before
his term expires in 1998, but he added that it was "not the
President" who personally encouraged the initiative to push the
amendments.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the amendments would also not be for personal
gains for the President who has pledged to step down when his term
ends in 1998, the Press Secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Villanueva said the ruling Lakas-NUCD would also help the
people's initiative so that it would succeed in amending the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, however, said Ramos was actually interested in
only one amendment to the Charter -- a second term for himself.

MOSCOW, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Israel would cooperate
in high technologies, electronics, aviation, space exploration and
processing of agricultural produce, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is contained in an agreement on cooperation and mutual
assistance in customs affairs signed by Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin and his Israeli counterpart Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony the premiers said at a press
briefing that they "are satisfied with exchange of opinion on a
wide range of issues, primarily trade and economy."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin stressed the need to boost cooperation in law
making, suggesting that a new agreement avoiding double taxation
be drafted to help expand bilateral trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier said the two countries are interested in
promoting joint products in third country markets. Israel, he
added, treats Russia as equally important strategic partner as the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also said that he and Chernomyrdin exchanged views on
the Israeli-Syrian talks and Russia's supplies of nuclear
technology to Iran.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN CCI Strives to Wipe Out Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN Chamber of Commerce and
Industry (ASEAN CCI) supports ASEAN 2020's economic vision of
eradicating poverty and increasing the region's share of world
trade.
</P>
<P>
The expression was made Tuesday at the end of ASEAN CCI's
two-day meeting here, official sources at the meeting said today.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN CCI also decided to focus its activities during the next
three years on three economic sectors: food and agriculture,
capital goods and tourism.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN CCI's Chairman Aburizal Bakrie said the vision of ASEAN
2020, initiated by ASEAN heads of state last December, should
include efforts to eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
He suggested a program in which regional governments and
private sectors aggressively pursued solutions to poverty.
</P>
<P>
"As part of out strategic plans, we have defined a number of
action plans to eradicate poverty in the region. We will bring the
proposal to respective governments in ASEAN," he said after the
closing the meeting last night.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand
and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
During their first informal summit here last December, ASEAN
leaders agreed to map out an ASEAN vision for the year 2020, a
guideline for direction beyond the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) in
2003.
</P>
<P>
At that summit, the leaders agreed to assign ministers to
develop an ASEAN vision for 2020.
</P>
<P>
The ministers were asked to submit their report to the second
informal summit which will be held in Malaysia this year
concurrently with ASEAN's 30th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the chairman of the executive committee of the ASEAN
CCI council Jose Concepcion said ASEAN economic ministers had
asked for input from business people to help map out the vision.
</P>
<P>
As ASEAN was setting a timetable for trade liberalization for
2003, it was decided it should also consider setting a timetable
for eradicating poverty and 2020 was the target year, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's anti-drug
police are to get backing from the army, air force and navy from

The three-pronged campaign was announced today after a meeting

<HEADLINE> Kjus Protest Downhill Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Last year's World Cup overall
champion Lasse Kjus withdrew from the men's downhill in Vail,
Colorado on Tuesday to protest against the exhausting World Cup
schedule.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian said he skipped the training runs for Wednesday's
race because of an exacting competition agenda which drove him to
three continents in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Kjus won the downhill at Kvitfjell, Norway, and came off third
in the Super-G there two weeks ago before going to Japan last week
for technical races at the arena of next year's Olympics.
</P>
<P>
He went out of both the slalom and giant slalom at Shiga Kogen
before travelling to Vail for this week's World Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old, who took world championship silvers in the
downhill, Super-G and giant slalom at Sestriere, even threatened a
formal complaint to the FIS over the scheduling.

PARIS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Belgian cyclist Tom Steels claimed
his second successive stage win in the Paris-Nice race on Tuesday
winning the 173km third stage in a sprint finish while France's
Laurent Jalabert retained the overall leaders jersey.

<P>
The 25-year-old Steels, who went second overall three seconds

Frenchman Frederic Moncassin, second on Monday, in third after
teammate and world champion Johan Musseuw had given him a lead
into the straight.
</P>
<P>
The stage had been enlivened by a breakaway by Frederic Pontier
of France who made a 68km lone escape until he was reeled in at
the 158km mark.
</P>
<P>
Jalabert, the world number one, had earlier extended his lead
when he claimed a two second bonus at an intermediary sprint.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Economy Shows Signs of Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian economy, which has
been in recession for the past five years, is showing signs of
recovery, Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavel Lazarenko said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production rose 1 percent last year, halting a five
year slide which had seen production plummet 54 percent, he told a
meeting of the Supreme Council.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's foreign trade rose 19 percent last year to 37.8
billion U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Lazarenko admitted that the government has failed to
improve the profitability of state-owned enterprises. He said 29
percent of industrial enterprises were in the red and Ukrainian
products were not competitive due to unsatisfactory industrial
reforms and the use of old technology, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko complained that the slow progress of legislation had
hindered the development of the national economy. He pledged to
speed up the lawmaking process to protect state and private
enterprises in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Italian Cycling Club Boss Warns Blood Test Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Fabrizio Fulan, head of MG Technogym
cycling club who were fined on Monday after one of their riders
failed a blood test, threatened his men with the sack on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
MG's Mauro Santaromita, who Furlan said will also now be fined
by his team, was one of three riders whose blood test on Sunday
revealed unusually high haemoglobin levels at the start of the
Paris-Nice cycling race.
</P>
<P>
The tests had been carried out to deter the use of EPO, or
erythropoietin, a drug produced to treat kidney disease and used
to increase oxygen-carrying red blood cell levels which improve
endurance.
</P>
<P>
Santaromita, fellow Italian Luca Colombo and Frenchman Erwan
Mentheour gave samples which showed red blood cell levels in
excess of the 50 percent limit.
</P>
<P>
The riders, who were the first victims of new rules which mean
a two-week ban for failing the test, were fined 1,000 Swiss francs
(480 U.S. dollars) and their teams fined 40,000 Swiss francs by
the UCI.
</P>
<P>
Haemoglobin tests were introduced at the request of riders at
the end of January as part of the fight against the use of EPO in
the sport.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Joins Indian Ocean Rim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Assured of economic and security
cooperation in Southeast and East Asia, Indonesia is now seeking
similar assurance from its western neighbors by joining an Indian
Ocean rim group, foreign minister Ali Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
"We need a stable and peaceful regional environment for the
sake of our national development," Alatas said here last night.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has joined the Indian Ocean Rim Association for
Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC)) and attended its first foreign
ministers meeting in Grand Bay, Mauritius, last week.
</P>
<P>
IOR-ARC groups Australia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Madagascar,
Malaysia, Mauritius, Mozambique, Oman, Singapore, south Africa,
Sri Lanka, Tanzania and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the IOR-ARC was aiming at encouraging balanced
economic growth in the Indian Ocean, "especially among its
members.
</P>
<P>
IOR-ARC will pave the way for the establishment of a regional
single market in the Indian Ocean region, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Considering that the majority of IOR-ARC members are
developing countries, we can expect a further broadening and
intensification of south-south cooperation through its
activities," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's total trade with IOR-ARC countries amounted to 11.4
billion US dollars in 1994. This substantially increased to 18.6
billion US dollars in 1995. Meanwhile, direct investment from six
IOR-ARC countries in Indonesia rose from 2.14 billion US dollars
in 1994 to 6 billion US dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Parliament Leader Calls Helms-Burton "a Lie" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's National Assembly President
Ricardo Alarcon described the United States Helms-Burton Act as "a
lie" -- incapable of scaring away foreign investments from the
island.
</P>
<P>
The essence of Helms-Burton is to return Cuba to Batistas,
landowners and the former exploiters, Alarcon was quoted as saying
by today's Granma newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon said the Helms-Burton Act hid its true objectives
behind words that misinformed.
</P>
<P>
The United States enacted the Helms-Burton law a year ago in an
attempt to tighten the embargo against Cuba. It establishes
sanctions against companies and businessmen who make use of
properties that were confiscated from U.S. citizens on the island.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon headed a program of public hearings in which thousands
of Cuban citizens analyzed and rejected the Helms-Burton law. They
backed the antidote law that has already been approved.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the midst of a national campaign of mobilizing and
repudiating the Helms-Burton, and supporting our Reaffirmation of
Cuba's Dignity and Sovereignty Law (as the antidote law is
known)," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Cuba's strategy to confront Washington's
sanction is to provide the greatest amount of information possible
to the people to let them know the real objectives of the
U.S. behind the Helms-Burton.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the fact that the U.S. wants to terrify foreign
investors, frighten them away from Cuba and create difficulties
for its foreign trade, new agreements and contracts were signed
and progress has been made in the economic opening during the past
year, the president of the legislative body said.
</P>
<P>
"More and more countries will defy the U.S. law and its
arrogance to do business with Cuba," declared Alarcon.
</P>
<P>
"Each step forward in our international economic relations is a
crack in the blockade wall that will get wider and wider," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Lures More Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Currently, the number of
overseas investors in Shanghai has reached nearly 16,000, with the
total investment amounting to 79.49 billion US dollars, up 10
percent and 16.2 percent respectively than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Over 70 percent of overseas-funded firms set up in 1996 have
invested 10 million US dollars apiece. More than half of the
world's 100 largest companies have invested in China's largest
city.
</P>
<P>
The overseas investors have been mainly involved in the
machinery, automotive, telecommunications, and chemical
industries.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, overseas businessmen have poured more funds
into the service sector. The number of overseas-funded firms has
now approached 5,000, an increase of 15.7 percent over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Local observers have attributed the steady increase in the
city's foreign capital to streamlined investment procedures and
the fact that most overseas-funded firms are doing well.

<HEADLINE> Pananthinaikos Advances to EuroLeague Quarter-Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Title holders Panathinaikos, who
beat Limoges 68-67 in the first leg, led from start to the last
whistle to record a 70-55 victory in the second leg and advanced
into the quarter-finals of the men's EuroLeague basketball
competitions on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tight defence and 25 points by American Byron Dinkins were the
keys to the victory of the Greeks, now trained by Bozidar
Maljkovic, the guru of European basketball, who led Limoges to
European championship triumph in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona, beaten controversially in last season's final by
Panathinaikos, booked their place in the last eight with a 72-62
win at home to Alba Berlin. The victory followed a handsome 95-77
success in Germany last week, but Barcelona made a meal out of
qualifying for the next round after going in at halftime with a
33-12 lead on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Olympiakos were expected to progress after winning 81-71 away
to Partizan Belgrade last week but surprisingly slipped up at home
on Tuesday, losing 61-60, and must now travel back to Belgrade for
the decider on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Four other ties remain unresolved, including Stefanel Milan vs
Kinder Bologna and Villeurbanne vs Estudiantes Madrid.

WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. military surplus dealer
today was convicted of masterminding the theft of 13 million U.S.
dollar fighting equipment including a tank and 17 armored
personnel carriers from a military base in Madison, Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
Leo Anthony Piatz, 37, was found guilty on all counts of
conspiracy, bribery and conversion of government property. He
could get up to 125 years in prison and 2.75 million dollars in
fines at sentencing next month, an Associated Press report said.
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors, Piatz used bribes, phony documents
and help from six accomplices to drive off with at least 153
vehicles from Fort McCoy, 95 miles northwest of Madison. Five
others charged in the scheme face trial in June.
</P>
<P>
The stolen equipment also included an airport runway snowblower
truck, a crane and other heavy equipment. They were taken between
1994 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Although no missiles or other weapons were stolen, launchers
for TOW anti-tank missiles were mounted on some of the armored
personnel carriers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The equipment was sold to museum and Colorado ski resort or
other places. Piatz was also accused of trying to lease a missile
launcher to 20th Century Fox for use in filming the Desert Storm
movie "Courage Under Fire," but the studio decided against the
deal.

<HEADLINE> US to Attend Arafat Conference if Invited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States will attend
an international conference called by Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat to discuss the Middle East peace process if it is formally
invited, the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"We're aware that Chairman Arafat has called for a conference
on Saturday in Gaza. We certainly, if an invitation is formally
issued to the United States, will be there," State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We do understand the frustration of the Palestinian
leadership. They've been buffeted by some fairly significant
Israeli government decisions over the last couple of weeks.
Chairman Arafat obviously feels the need to talk to friendly
countries around the world, and that's appropriate," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process is at a deadlock as the Israeli
government decided to build Jewish homes in Arab east Jerusalem,
touching off a worldwide criticism.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, angered by the Israeli decision, has called for
international intervention to force Israel to abandon the plan,
and henceforth he proposed the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the United States would be represented by its
consul-general in Jerusalem Edward Abington at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said in reaction to the
proposed meeting that it would violate agreements and freeze the
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Dow Sets Another Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
edged to its second straight record high, but most stock
indicators slid today as interest rates rose in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow crossed the 7,100 mark for the first time, but
surrendered a nearly 33-point gain to close at 7,085.16, up just
5.77 on the day.
</P>
<P>
Broader measures turned lower as money market interest rates
turned higher, providing an excuse for some profit-taking on
Monday's record-setting advance.
</P>
<P>
There was little reaction to news that workplace productivity
increased 0.7 percent last year, a downward revision from the 0.8
percent annual gain reported a month ago, but still the biggest
improvement in four years. The Labor Department also reported that
fourth-quarter productivity grew at a 1.1 percent annual rate, only
half the 2.2 percent figure originally reported.
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 491.33 million shares,
up from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 2.31 to 811.34, while
the NYSE composite index, which closed at a record high Monday,
fell 0.64 to 427.06.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 5.96 to 1,316.76, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.20 to 603.43.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices fell, the yield on the 30-year Treasury rose
as high as 6.86 percent from late Monday's 6.81 percent before
settling at about 6.85 percent.

<HEADLINE> US Urges EU to Accept Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government said today
that the European Union (EU) should accept Turkey as its new
member in the future.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is a European country," State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns told reporters. "We strongly believe that the
European Union should allow the possibility of Turkish membership
in the future."
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation EU rejected a membership of Turkey last week.
Some EU members insisted that Turkey is an Asian nation, not
European.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a vote in the European Union, nor do we seek
one," Burns said. "But we very respectfully think of Turkey as a
European country and not send negative signals to Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Turkey, already a member country of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), signed an agreement on Customs Union with the
EU in January 1996 and has been seeking an EU membership.

<HEADLINE> US Rules Out Participation in Multinational Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that it was not prepared for the moment to participate in a
multinational force in Zaire to rescue refugees and stem any
crisis in that country.
</P>
<P>
"We are not prepared right now to sign on to a multinational
force," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a
regular news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Burns was rebuffing a U.N. proposal, which was backed by
France, of forming such a force to restore order to the war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States did not believe "there is a military
solution to the problems of Zaire."
</P>
<P>
"We think that actually what's being done is the best way to
help the refugees and to stop the fighting -- to pursue the
cease-fire and to continue to encourage the United Nations to
deliver this humanitarian assistance," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States starts to evacuate American
citizens in Zaire in case the spread of fighting could threaten
their lives.
</P>
<P>
"The department has authorized the voluntary departure of the
dependents of our American government employees at our embassy in
Kinshasa. U.S. citizens currently in Zaire should consider very
carefully their personal-security situation and... to depart
Zaire," Burns said.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Demands Prosecution of West Mostar Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
demanded today that authorities in West Mostar, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, suspend and prosecute police officers involved in a
violent assault against a group of Muslim civilians in February.
</P>
<P>
In the February 10 incident, described in documents before the
council, a procession of several hundred Bosniacs, led by
religious and political leaders, traveled from East Mostar, across
the former confrontation line, to visit a cemetery in West Mostar,
in observance of the Bajram religious holiday.
</P>
<P>
After briefly conversing with several West Mostar policemen,
members of the procession continued towards the cemetery only to
be attacked by West Mostar police wielding batons. At least two
plain-clothes officers then fired into the retreating marchers,
killing one and wounding 20.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read out by its president, Zbigniew Mari
Wlosowicz of Poland, the council, taking note of the announced
suspension of some of the police officers identified in an
International Police Task Force report, expressed deep concern at
the failure to date of the responsible authorities to take all the
necessary steps to implement the conclusions drawn from that
report.
</P>
<P>
The council condemned the involvement of West Mostar police
officers in the violent assault of February 10, as well as the
failure of local police to protect civilians subjected to
inter-ethnic attacks which occurred before and after the incident,
and stressed the importance it attaches to preventing such
incidents in the future.

<HEADLINE> US Says Vietnam Debt Agreement Helps Normanization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The normalization of economic
relationships between the United States and Vietnam could take on
a speedy track after Vietnam agreed to repay debt owed to the
United States from the Vietnam War era, the U.S. State Department
said today.
</P>
<P>
"What't significant about it is it helps propel us down the
road to normalization of our economic relationships," State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam and the United States initialed an agreement Friday in
Hanoi, under which Vietnam will repay "all of its economic and
social debt to the United States, which totals approximately 145
million dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the debt involved four U.S. Agency for International
Development loans and two food aid loans. Three of the four AID
loans were made in 1960 and 1961, essentially to develop physical
infrastructure projects in Saigon.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding military debt owed by South Vietnam to the
United States was not under consideration for repayment.
</P>
<P>
The United States channeled billions of dollars to help rescue
Saigon authorities during the Vietnam War until it was defeated
and Hanoi reunified the whole country in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Rebel Policemen Allowed Asylum in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government today decided to approve the asylum applications of
two Lesotho policemen who fled their country after a police
mutiny was put down in the kingdom last month.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Spokesman Hennie Meyer said the approval decision
was made at a meeting in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by representatives from departments
of home affairs, foreign affairs and the justice, the police and
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
Meyer said Lieutenant Phakiso Molise, the leader of the police
mutiny, and his fellow policeman Sergeant Motlatsi Makapeng were
granted permits to remain in South Africa until their
applications had been processed.
</P>
<P>
Molise and other seven junior police officers seized control
of the police headquarters in Maseru on February 6 in fear of
being arrested on charges of murder and kidnaping arising from a
faction shooting at a Maseru police station in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
Molise escaped with Makapeng from their hideout in the
Maseru Palace of King Letsie III shortly after the military
crack-down on the mutiny on February 16, and holed up later in
Pretoria for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
However, Lesotho's government has earlier asked the South
African government to extradite the two men to Lesotho so as to
have them face murder charges. enditem

<HEADLINE> UK PM Agrees to Investigate Hygiene in Abattoirs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
agreed today to look into claims that the government was warned
about hygiene standards in abattoirs months ago.
</P>
<P>
Major told parliament that he shared the concerns of Labor
leader Tony Blair and meat inspectors to ensure higher standards
of hygiene.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister said he was "surprised" at the content
of a letter from the Association of Meat Inspectors, which said
the government was warned months ago of a potential contamination
"time bomb."
</P>
<P>
The warning was contained in the letter to Agriculture Minister
Angela Browning by the association's General Secretary Peter
Comrie in February.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party, which last week accused the government of
covering up a report on abattoir standards, published Comrie's
letter to Johnston McNeil, chief executive of the Meat Hygiene
Service.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Comrie told McNeil in January, "It appears
from the very many phone calls from members that far from
improving, standards of hygiene are steadily decreasing."
</P>
<P>
Comrie wrote to McNeil again recently, saying inspectors were
being "actively encouraged to ignore breaches of regulations and
in some cases threatened if they try to take action."
</P>
<P>
"Overall the system does not seem to be working in favor of
public protection," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party has pledged to set up a Food Standard Agency
independent of the Agriculture Ministry to ensure consumer
interests are not sacrificed to those of farmers.
</P>
<P>
But Major said he still did not favor the setting up of an
independent agency, saying "there is still a need for a minister
to be in charge, and to be answerable to MPs."

<HEADLINE> UN Says There Is Growing Humanitarian Crisis in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. spokesman said
today that the humanitarian crisis in Zaire in growing and that
the U.N. is looking for member states to act to meet the
humanitarian challenge.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said U.N.
staffers in eastern Zaire have reported that the number of
refugees reaching the Zairian town of Ubundu was "swelling
rapidly" and in "alarming shape."
</P>
<P>
"The refugees are in malnutrition with their feet swollen and
covered with festering sores," Eckhard said. "Because of the
humid weather, the sores are slow to heal. The people are weak and
in pain. They can only walk one or two kilometers a day. And those
are the stronger ones."
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Security Council called on rebel leader Laurent
Kabila to accept a cease-fire and begin negotiations on a
five-point U.N. peace plan. The Zairian government has already
accepted the cease-fire call.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said the United Nations was studying plans for
monitoring a cease-fire in Zaire "using mechanical means as well
as troops." He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
He said that because of the reluctance of major governments to
authorize a new force, U.N. efforts have been limited to
humanitarian operations.
