<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A new oilfield has been lately
discovered in the Sahara desert of Algeria outside El Merk, in the
Eastern Erg region, the Algerian Ministry of Energy was quoted as
saying today.

This is the seventh oilfield discovered jointly by Algeria and
foreign oil companies this year, and the 31st discovered since
1986, when Algeria began to allow foreign oil companies to explore
oil.
</P>
<P>
Algeria, whose national income almost completely depends on oil
exportation, is producing 750,000 barrels of oil per day.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Supreme Court Defers Bhutto's Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of
Pakistan today deferred the case of deposed prime minister Benazir
Bhutto against the dismissal of her government.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to take up cases on Eighth Amendment first as
we want to first dispose of controversy on it," Chief Justice of
Pakistan Syed Sajjad Ali Shah said while heading a seven-man bench
constituted to hear Bhutto's case and the petitions challenging
the Eighth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
Achakzai, a deputy in the defunct National Assembly, has
challenged the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, which
empowers the President to dissolve the lower house of parliament
when he is satisfied that the government can't be run in
accordance with the Constitution and an appeal to the electorate
is necessary.
</P>
<P>
"We know that other cases are equally important including
Benazir Bhutto's case," the chief justice said, adding, "we want
to do away with the controversy on Eighth Amendment firstly."
</P>
<P>
Bhutto's attorney Aitzaz Ahsan said today, "we bow before the
decision of the court."
</P>
<P>
Pakistani President Farooq Leghari dissolved the national
assembly and sacked Benazir Bhutto on November 5. According to the
Constitution, new general elections must be held in 90 days
following the dismissal.

<HEADLINE> OAPEC Calls for Better Coordination Among Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Oil ministers of the
Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) ended
their 57th meeting here today, calling for closer coordination
among member states.
</P>
<P>
The one-day session of the OAPEC's Ministerial Council urged
energy and environment specialists in the member states to
coordinate their efforts and actively participate in various
international cooperation, said press statements released at the
end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ministers chose Cairo as their upcoming meeting place next
year and reviewed preparations for the 6th Arab Energy
Conference, due to be held in Damascus in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Council has decided to extend the mandate of Iraq's
supervision of the Arab Oil Institute For Training for two more
years.
</P>
<P>
The Ministerial Council meeting under the chairmanship of
Qatari Minister of Energy and Industry Abdullah Ben Hamad
al-Attiya also reviewed reports on the activities of the OAPEC's
offshoot companies and functions of the Secretariat General in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member OAPEC ratified the budget of the organization
for 1997 and discussed joint Arab oil projects underway in the
member states.
</P>
<P>
The grouping of Arab oil producers, set up in 1968 with a view
to developing oil industry through fostering cooperation among
its members, now sponsors five joint ventures and their
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
Eight Arab ministers from Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Qatar, Libya, Algeria and Bahrain attend the 57th session of the
Kuwait-based body, while Iraq and the United Arab Emirates sent
ministerial representatives to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's representative to the Arab League Nabil Nejm headed the
delegation from Iraq, which resumed its limited oil exports only
four days ago after six years of sufferings under the
U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq reopened its pipeline in the north Tuesday to pump oil
through Turkey to the world market for the first time since the
U.N. imposed the sanctions on Iraq in 1990 following its invasion
of neighboring Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of Iraqi oil outflow, which supposedly will
have limited impact on the world market in the short term, was
not included in the agenda of the just-concluded OAPEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad will sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every
six months for the purchase of food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
By 1982 the OAPEC membership has risen to 11
countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates. In
1986, the organization suspended Tunisia's membership at its
request.
</P>
<P>
Its 10 member states make up more than 70 percent of the
entire Arab world population and take up two thirds of the world
oil reserves, according to the OAPEC Data Bank.
</P>
<P>
The OAPEC turns out 17.2 million barrels of crude oil a day,
accounting for 26 percent of the global production. Its
oil exports amounted to 33 percent of the world total in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The organization discharges its duty through four main bodies,
the Ministerial Council, which holds meetings twice a year, the
Executive Bureau, the Secretariat General and the Judicial
Panel.

<HEADLINE> Chengdu's Telephone Numbers to Be Upgraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- This capital of southwest
China's Sichuan Province will upgrade its six-digit telephone
numbers to seven digits from midnight tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Along with the number upgrading, the different region codes for
the telephone systems of 12 of the city's suburban districts will
be unified to one number -- 028 -- expanding the city's local call
service to all its suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the local phone service was not even available at
Chengdu's airport, though the airport is only 20 km away from the
downtown area.
</P>
<P>
As the capital of the country's most populous province, Chengdu
has developed into one of the eight telecommunications hubs of the
country. A local telecom official said that the upgrading of the
phone numbers will greatly improve the city's telephone service,

<HEADLINE> Low Job Creation Retards Zimbabwe's Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment remains one of
the major challenges facing the Zimbabwean economy as the current
rate of job creation has failed to absorb the increasing number
of school leavers entering the job market, Finance Minister
Herbert Murerwa said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ZANU PF National Conference in Bulawayo,
Murerwa said the Zimbabwean economy had been generating
employment at the average rate of 1.5 percent since independence
while the labour force has been growing at an average of 4.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Currently 200,000 school leavers enter the job market each
year but only 20,000 to 30,000 new jobs are created annually in
the formal sector.
</P>
<P>
''This rate of employment creation is too low to make any
meaningful impact to the unemployment problem,'' Murerwa told the
5,000 delegates to the conference during debate on the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said a sustained high economic growth rate was required to
create employment opportunities and the government had designed
various measures and policies to induce increased investment for
employment creation.
</P>
<P>
The immediate task was to introduce measures to create an
economic environment which had low interest and inflation rates
to attract investment.
</P>
<P>
The government had also embarked on programs to improve
productivity of communal and resettlement farmers to create
employment in the rural areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
He outlined various measures that the government had
undertaken to support business enterprises, including setting
aside a fund for black-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
The huge deficit was responsible for instability in the
macro-economic environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Delegates urged the government to increase support for the
informal sector and the small and medium-sized enterprises in
order to create jobs. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain welcomed today the
appointment of Ghana's Kofi Annan as the next U.N.
secretary-general, saying Annan would fill this vitally important
post with great distinction.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said in a statement
that he had the highest regard for Annan, with whom Britain had
worked very closely for many years and the British government
would give him its full support.
</P>
<P>
"He has enormous experience of the U.N. in all its aspects
including administration and finance as well as the key political
issues," Rifkind said.
</P>
<P>
"His experience and outstanding personal qualities make him
ideally qualified to lead the U.N. in tackling the many urgent
tasks which it currently faces," he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan, 58, currently U.N. undersecretary-general for
peacekeeping operations, was chosen by the U.N. Security Council
Friday to be the seventh secretary-general in the history of the
world body after Egypt's Boutros Boutros-Ghali's reappointment was
vetoed by the United States.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Warring Factions Nearing Understanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The warring factions in
Afghanistan were nearing an understanding on a ceasefire and
exchange of POWs, the official Pakistan TV (PTV) reported here
this evening.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a 12-member commission might be set up to
monitor the implementation of a ceasefire between the Taliban
Militia and the anti-Taliban alliance led by Rashid Dostum.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the possible ceasefire to the joint
initiatives taken by Pakistan and the UN special mission to
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
It said that Pakistan has been able to assist in bringing about
this understanding because it maintained contact with all factions
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
This understanding would soon lead to an agreement that once a
ceasefire had come into effect, there should be a political
commission consisting of representatives of all Afghan provinces,
it noted.
</P>
<P>
The commission would discuss the issues of demobilization of
warlords and collection of heavy weapons, the formation and
induction of a neutral Afghan force comprising representatives
from all provinces to provide peace and security in Kabul, and the
formation of a broad-based government, it added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Minister Stresses African Norms, Morals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Higher Education
Minister Ignatius Chombo today said there is an urgent need for
universities in the country to come up with a philosophy of higher
education that is based on African norms and morals to create
academics who have the capacity to improve human life in their
respective communities.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at Africa University's second graduation ceremony in
Mutare of east Zimbabwe, the minister said it was sad that
universities in the country were training African students on models
and philosophies based on western values which had no relevance to
local realitiees.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had since independence in 1980 only made
cosmetic changes in terms of higher education, raising the need to
revamp the whole system and create models relevant to the country's
needs and aspirations.
</P>
<P>
''Our universities are training African students, not European or
American, and yet our philosophy of higher education comes from the
west. It is high time we developed our own philosophy of higher
education based on our norms, values and morals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Higher education, he said, was one of the major contributors to
the country's economic development and the government expected
university to be alive and responsive to developmental goals.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed students and staff must engage in dialogue with
the government instead of adopting confrontational attitudes which
led to misunderstandings, frustration and destructive behaviour.
</P>
<P>
Some 21 students from Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Angola and Tanzania
received degrees for bachelor of science in agriculture and natural
resources and divinity. enditem

<HEADLINE> PAC Leader Calls for Internal Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, December 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Pan
Africanist Congress President Clarence Makwetu on Saturday called
on PAC members to maintain unity at "crucial time".
</P>
<P>
Addressing a three-day PAC party congress in Thohoyandou, Northern
Province, Makwetu pointed out that "this is not the time to create
enemies and divisions... It is time for unity".
</P>
<P>
He stressed the PAC, the third biggest black political party
in South Africa after the ruling African National Congress and
the Inkatha Freedom Party, must revitalise itself ahead of the
1999 national elections.
</P>
<P>
It has been noticed that Makwetu's remarks, apparently referring to
PAC internal divisions, were made at a time when some PAC National
Executive Committee members were reportedly trying to make Makwetu not
available for reelection of PAC leader. The criticizers said the
PAC leader should be responsible for almost all his party's ills.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu also criticised the ANC government, which, he said, had
created a new elite instead of serving the masses. enditem

<HEADLINE> British Foreign Secretary To Visit Cyprus Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind will arrive in Cyprus Sunday for a two-day
visit, during which he will have talks with both communities on
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
His visit, initially scheduled to start on Monday, has been
brought forward because of a crucial parliamentary vote in
London Monday night, according to a British High Commission
press release.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides will return to
Cyprus from Dublin one hour before Rifkind's arrival to meet his
British counterpart at Larnaca International Airport. Michaelides
is now in Dublin to attend meetings within the framework of the
European Union summit.
</P>
<P>
The British official is expected to have a working breakfast
Monday morning with President Glafcos Clerides and later on he
will meet Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in the
Turkish-controlled northern part of Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind came under heavy fire on the island last week over
his comment in the British House of Commons that the entry of a
divided Cyprus to the EU would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
He has also been criticized by Cypriot politicians for his
planned meeting with the Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cyprus News Agency Saturday, Rifkind
said he was "surprised at the degree of misunderstanding of what
was actually a very clear point."
</P>
<P>
He, however, said that Britain will make efforts to find a
solution to the Cyprus problem before the start of membership
talks between the EU and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind's visit will be the first by a British foreign
secretary since 1960 when the island, a former British colony,
became an independent republic, apart from a visit by his
predecessor Douglas Hurd during the Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Greece and Turkey were the guarantors of Cyprus'
independence under the 1960 treaty of establishment of the
Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkey sent troops and
took control of the northern part of the island following a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Pak President Files Reply on Dissolution Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari today filed a reply before the Supreme Court of Pakistan
to substantiate the ground for dissolving the National Assembly
and dismissing Benazir Bhutto's government.
</P>
<P>
In the detailed written reply, containing 202 pages with facts
and figures in support of the dissolution order, the president put
before the apex court the evidences to prove the magnitude of
corruption and mal-practices committed by the former government.
</P>
<P>
The president, who was held respondent in the case, elaborated
nine grounds which left him with no choice but to exercise his
power under the constitution to disband the assembly and dismiss
Bhutto's government.
</P>
<P>
He explained how her government was engaged in
institutionalizing corruption, nepotism and abuse of power, and
weaving these into the very fabric of government.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that governments must be given full
opportunity to chalk out their agendas, implement their policies
and give full effect to their vision for Pakistan and its future.
</P>
<P>
However, he added when the agenda is only personal
aggrandizement at the expense of the people, the state and the
public exchequer, when the policies being implemented are not
merely violative of law, but are designed to institutionalize
corruption, nepotism and abuse of power, when the acts and
omissions of a government are leading to complete breakdown of all
institutions, the president must very seriously ponder over the
use of his constitutional power.
</P>
<P>
The written reply highlighted the instances of massive
corruption and wrong-doings, including defying of orders of the
superior courts and bugging of their telephones, as well as
deteriorating situation of law and order where extra-judicial
killings took place, and where the former prime minister's own
brother was killed.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the entire system of government was
polluted and corrupted by the illegal appointments of thousands of
persons and the public exchequer was treated as though it were the
personal kitty of the former prime minister and her cohorts.
</P>
<P>
The president said Bhutto's government was dismissed when it
appeared that the nationalized banks were brazenly looted and the
banking sector effectively destroyed, and when even Baitul Mal
funds, meant exclusively for the destitute and the needy, were not
spared.
</P>
<P>
The reply was filed by the president's counsel Khalid Anwar, in
response to a petition filed by Benazir Bhutto on November 13
challenging the dismissal of her government.
</P>
<P>
Leghari dismissed Benazir Bhutto's government and dissolved the
National Assembly on November 5 on charges of confrontation with
the judiciary, extra-judicial killing and mismanagement.

<HEADLINE> Swiss National Bank Responsible for Gold Deal With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Former directors of the Swiss
National Bank (SNB) were somewhat responsible for buying gold from
Nazi Germany during World War Two.
</P>
<P>
SNB President Hans Meyer admitted Friday that during World War
Two, former SNB directors had bought gold worth 1.21 billion Swiss
francs from Germany and transferred 428 million francs to national
banks of Portugal and Sweden for the Reichsbank, Germany's
national bank then, getting a profit of 20 million francs. The SNB
also bought gold worth 1.758 billion francs from the United States
and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Meyer said that it is hard to understand why former SNB leaders
made the gold deal with Nazi Germany at so great a risk. However,
he stressed, in the SNB's treasury now, there is not a single gold
bar with the Third Reich mark nor gold seized by Germany from
Belgium and the Netherlands, said local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government pays close attention to the investigation
into the country's financial dealings with Nazi Germany during
World War Two and has set up an investigation panel headed by
Thomas Borer, Swiss ambassador to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The panel, formed by historians and financial and legal experts
in October, will be empowered to lift bank secrecy rules in order
to have a thorough investigation.

</P>
<P>
Leghari made the remarks while meeting with Ismail Hakki
Karadayi, visiting chief of General Staff of Turkish armed
forces, at the Presidential House.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said that Pakistan and Turkey have very close and
strong bonds of friendship.
</P>
<P>
"We should try to further enhance bilateral trade as there are
sufficient similarities between our economies," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Turkey could cooperate with each other in several
traditional and non-traditional areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The experts and the technicians of the two countries should
work together to identify areas for joint ventures and joint
production in high tech-industry and other specific areas like
agriculture and agricultural research," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the security environment in South Asia, Leghari
said that Pakistan wants peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan, Leghari said
that Pakistan wants a just solution of the Afghan problem in which
genuine interests of all major groups are taken into account to
ensure sustainable peace in that war-ravaged country, preferably
under the U.N. umbrella.
</P>
<P>
Karadayi hoped that his visit will further improve the close
and cordial relationship between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Japan Warms to Strengthening Relations with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan should face up to
history and maintain good neighborliness with China and other
Asian nations, former prime minister Masaharu Gotoda said in a
symposium on Japan-China relations today.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, held in Tokyo's Japan-China Friendship Center,
saw the participation of more than 130 people from all walks of
life. They agreed that a new prospect for the bilateral
relationship of the two neighboring countries, and their friendly
cooperation, would not only be beneficial to both countries
themselves, but to the stability and prosperity of the whole Asian
region.
</P>
<P>
Gotoda, who is also the head of the Japan-China Friendship
Center, stressed that Japan should face up to its past and take
into consideration the feelings of Chinese people, who were
gravely hurt during the War.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that if Japan gave up the peaceful and friendly
relations with China and other Asian countries, the interest and
security of Japanese people might be in danger.
</P>
<P>
Yosuke Nakae, former Japanese ambassador to China, briefed the
symposium on the current situation and problems of Sino-Japanese
relations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that to promote mutual understanding and trust was
among the top priorities when solving problems between the
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique the two countries signed when they
normalized relations in 1972, and the 1978 peace and friendship
pact, were mentioned. They were regarded by the participants as
the root of developing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Participants shared the view that historic education in Japan
has great flaws, therefore should be corrected by the
government. They also called on the government to take effective
measures to strengthen the communications between younger
generation of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation with China is also a major topic of the
symposium, which backed Japan's technological export to China.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Greece Strives to Join EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Greece, a relative poor member
country of the European Union, is striving hard to join the
European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 2000 or 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government, led by Prime Minister Costas Simitis
whose Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) just won the general
elections less than three months ago, acknowledges that the
country has little chance of joining the EMU on January 1, 1999
but is determined to be among the second wave of entrants one year
or two years later.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Greece is the only EU state which has so
far met none of a single Maastricht criterion, which includes an
inflation rate of up to 1.5 percent above the average of the best
three performers, a budget deficit of below 3 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP), a total debt of below 60 percent of GDP,
stable long-term interest rates and membership in the EU's
exchange rate mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The corresponding figures of the country's economic performance
released by the National Statistic Department show the inflation
rate in November stood at 7.7 percent, the budget deficit in 1996
is expected to reach 8.0 percent, the total debt accounts for
109.3 percent of GDP in 1996 and the long-term interest is as high
as 13.4 percent, a far cry from the Maastricht criterion of being
within 2 percent of average of the best three. Besides, Greece has
never been a member in the EU's exchange rate mechanism.
</P>
<P>
In order to bring the country within striking distance of
joining the EMU, the Simitis government has recently unveiled the
country's austerity budget which has been described as "the
toughest budget in 15 years."
</P>
<P>
The budget, which is currently being debated and is expected to
be approved by parliament in a couple of days, plans to cover
"five-sixths of the distance" towards the EMU, according to National
Economy Minister Yannos Papandoniou.
</P>
<P>
The budget aims at increased revenue and spending cuts totaling
about a trillion drachmas (about 4.2 billion U.S. dollars) in
order to cut the budget deficit to 4.2 percent from an anticipated
8.0 percent this year. Most of the increased revenue will come
from a more efficient value added tax (vat) collection and from
surcharge on large real estate, taxation of interest earned on
state debt paper, the abolition of several tax breaks, the
increased road taxes for cars and bikes and a better management of
state assets.
</P>
<P>
The budget also provides for the limiting of pay raises which
will help inflation drop to 4.5 percent at the end of 1997 and to
3 percent or below at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The austerity policies have already triggered dissent among the
Greek people and the country has witnessed a wave of protests in
the past weeks including the current ongoing farmers' protest,
which blocked all the main roads and railway links throughout the
country for the 17th day today.
</P>
<P>
But the leadership of the country seems determined to reach the
convergency criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty through its
harsh economic policy and has called on the people to understand
the importance for the country to be within the EMU by the turn of
of the century.
</P>
<P>
To join the EMU "is not exclusively economic in nature, but is a
political issue," Prime Minister Simitis declared.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the EMU would constitute "a new center of
gravity in the world which is now being shaped" and would play a
decisive role in all issues pertaining to Greece's national policy
and Greece would participate in the EMU in order to safeguard its
standing and ensure its decisive role in developments."

<HEADLINE> UK Food Poisoning Outbreak Claims 12th Victim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the food
poisoning outbreak in Lanarkshire, Scotland, has risen to 12,
according to a BBC television report today.
</P>
<P>
The latest victim of the food poisoning caused by the E coli
bacteria was an 84-year-old woman who died in a Glasgow hospital.
</P>
<P>
The 12 people who have died in the crisis have all been
elderly, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who have been affected is thought to be
nearing 400, but the rate of increase has fallen, raising hopes
that the worst is over.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that E coli is a common gut bacteria that is
normally harmless, but a toxic strain that lives in cattle can be
passed to human via manure or improper slaughtering.
</P>
<P>
Two butcher's shops which were linked to the crisis have been
closed.

<HEADLINE> UK Population to Fall by 5 Mln in 70 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The British population will be
about 5 million less than now in 70 years' time, falling more
sharply than previously estimated, according to new projections by
the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
The ONS projections show that the country's population will
peak in 2023 at more than 61 million before starting to fall at a
rate accelerating to an annual net loss of 250,000 by the middle
of the next century and to 54 million in 2061.
</P>
<P>
The official forecast is based on the 1994 population figures
which stood at 58.4 million.
</P>
<P>
Statisticians revised down their projections because as a
result of an even lower birth rate compared with previously
estimated, they are expecting 2 million fewer births over the next
40 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ONS is now also expecting a slightly higher
death rate than previously forecast among very elderly people.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the statisticians estimate that there will be 6
percent fewer people over 75 by 2021 than it last suggested.
</P>
<P>
The lower projections will have an important impact on
government planning for numbers of school places, health and
welfare budgets and housing.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of diarrhoea has killed
at least six people in Cestos, a coastal city in southeastern Liberia,
due to lack of safe drinking water.

During the two-day EU summit which ended this afternoon, the
European Council had "an in-depth discussion on the growth and
employment strategy" and urged all the EU member states to pursue

covering all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that full
potential benefit of the internal market is achieved before the

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is to host a regional
summit next Monday aimed at lifting economic sanctions imposed on
Burundi, the Kenya News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The summit to be chaired by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi

Salim are scheduled to arrive here tomorrow afternoon to attend
the summit.
</P>

Tanzanian government sources were quoted as saying last week
in Arusha that the sanctions "have totally failed to bring about
the designed goal and are not effective at all, while pressure is
mounting from every corner that they should be lifted."

Central African leaders called for an end to the trade embargo
imposed upon Burundi in July this year.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Disarms 4,500 Factional Fighters in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The west african peacekeeping force
in Liberia known as ECOMOG has disarmed 4,500 factional fighters since
the disarmament exercise started on November 22.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several thousands of weapons have been recovered
by ECOMOG in the past few months through the cordon and search
operations and night patrols in Monrovia, capital of Liberia, and its
environs in the aftermath of the April 6 fighting, said ECOMOG
Commander Major-General Victor Malu, quoted by reports today.
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, more fighters would have been disarmed if there
had been adequate supply of food, particularly rice, to distribute as
welfare gestures to the armed men and women.
</P>
<P>
"We have found out that rice supply to ex-combatants could hasten
disarmament," he said during a meeting with the regional director of
the World Food Program (WFP), Jaime Wickens, and the agency
coordinator in Liberia Arnt Breivik on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The WFP is currently providing wheat as an incentive to
disarming fighters of rival factions. In March last year, the agency
replaced rice, Liberia's staple, with wheat in its food rations
to displaced Liberians after donors stopped supplying rice for
the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
Malu said he is optimistic that an increase in food supply would
further encourage more fighters to turn in their arms, adding that
lack of food supply has slowed down the tempo of disarmament at some
centers, particularly in the hinterland.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted this was the second time in one week that the
ECOMOG commander called on the international community to increase
food supply as encouragement for factional fighters to lay down their
weapons.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace accord signed last August in Abuja, capital
of Nigeria, the estimated 60,000 combatants in Liberia will be
disarmed and demobilized in three months up to the end of January next
year.
</P>
<P>
In response, Wickens said although the WFP was aware that rice was
"more acceptable in Liberia, bulgur wheat was far more nutritious than
rice."
</P>
<P>
The WFP policy was not in support of issuing rice, he said, adding
that "the problems associated with rice distribution were enormous
because of the commercial value of the commodity."
</P>
<P>
However, he assured ECOMOG that the WFP would move more food into
disarmament sites in the hinterland for disarming fighters.  enditem

PARIS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- France has promised to provide 1
billion francs (200 million U.S. dollars) in loans to Lebanon for
the country's reconstruction projects, the Agence France Presse

</P>
<P>
The source failed to provide further details on how the loans

Lebanon will present 31 reconstruction projects, which are

<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette will lead a French

</P>
<P>
A French government spokesman said Friday that France will have

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Calls for Risk Awareness of Stock Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper,
"The People's Daily," will carry a front page commentary tomorrow
which urges investors to steer clear of excessive speculation on
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The article, titled "A Correct Understanding of the Current
Stock Market", warns that the government will not and is not able
to interfere with the market to prevent prices from falling -- a
message aimed at some investors' misconception that the government
will not let the market plummet at the time of Hong Kong's
approaching the return to the embrace of the motherland, and the
convocation of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The commentary starts by reviewing the bullish trend of the
market since last April. From April 1 to December 9, the
composite index of the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) rallied up
120 percent, while that of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange skyrocketed by
340 percent. At present, more than 21 million people are engaged
in stock trading across the country.
</P>
<P>
While it recognizes that the flourishing Chinese stock market
can be soundly explained by the the global bull market and the
improvement of the domestic economic situation, the commentary
nonetheless describes the surging tide in the market as "abnormal
and irrational."
</P>
<P>
It goes on to compare price/earning ratios and trading volumes
of the Chinese market with those of some overseas markets, and
observes that the decrease in after-tax profits of listed
companies and the increase in irregular trading activities in
recent months have boosted the trading volume.
</P>
<P>
For example, on December 5, the combined trading volumes of the
Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges hit 35 billion yuan, three
times the highest daily trading figure reported by the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange, whereas the total value of the Chinese stock market
is about one tenth that of the Hong Kong market.
</P>
<P>
The commentary attributes the soaring market to five
factors: some major institutional investors, mostly state-owned
enterprises, have manipulated the market to their own advantage;
large amounts of bank capital have flowed into the market; some
securities companies have overdrawn large amounts of funds; and
both are against regulations.
</P>
<P>
A number of media organizations have also played a significant
role in helping boost the market by consistently predicting rises
and seldom cautioning investors against risks, which consequently
led many investors to draw the conclusion that the stock market
will not plunge.
</P>
<P>
To give readers a full understanding of the potential risks of
an overheated stock market, the commentary cites the stock crash
in the United States in 1929, which led to the Great
Depression.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Management of Public Security at Grass-roots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China has issued a set of
provisions aimed at ensuring long-term social stability and
safeguarding people's lives and work by giving more play to
grassroots organizations.
</P>
<P>
The "Provisions for Improving Basic and Grassroots Work of
Comprehensive Management of Public Security" were recently
released by the Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of
Public Security.
</P>
<P>
The guiding principles of the document hold that a leadership
responsibility system should be included in the drive to improve
the comprehensive management of public security, that the efforts
of the masses should be united with special anti-crime
organizations, that additional manpower, material and financial
support should be given to the grassroots organizations, and that
an efficient working mechanism concerning the management of public
security for these organizations should be established.
</P>
<P>
All of these measures should uphold Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building China into a socialist country with Chinese
characteristics, and also follow the basic line of the Chinese
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
According to the provisions, determined efforts must be made to
improve the management and protection measures of public security,
bolster propaganda and education on legal construction, carry out
the comprehensive mangement of public security in a democratic
way, enhance the crime-fighting capability of grassroots
organizations, and sort out and remove factors which are harmful
to social stability in its early stage.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of Public
Security urged that necessary financial and material support be
provided for grassroots law-enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
The committee stressed that a patrol system to protect
residential areas must be set up at the grassroots level, and a
good job must be done in handling the migrant population.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Calls for Risk Awareness of Stock Market (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"There is no stock market that always grows and never drops,"
the commentary cautions. It reviews the three outstanding
fluctuations of the SSE index in the past few years, which caused
huge financial losses for many investors and major setbacks in
investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
"Stock rallies are bound to lead to stock crashes," it says,
pointing out that in a fledgling stock market like China's, the
main cause of the sharp ups and downs should be attributed to
over-speculations by stock traders.
</P>
<P>
It warns that investors have to be responsible for their own
gains and losses, and should be fully aware of the risks they are
taking.
</P>
<P>
The commentary reviews the efforts made by the Chinese
government to regulate the stock market. Last year, the State
Council formulated the policy on the development of the securities
market, which focuses on "legality, supervision, self-discipline,
and standardization."
</P>
<P>
Since the end of 1992, the state has promulgated a series of
laws and regulations on the stock market, including the Corporate
Law, Interim Regulations on Stock Issuing and Trading, and Interim
Regulations to Forbid Cheating Activities in Securities
Dealing. And securities regulatory bodies have done much to
regulate and foster the market.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November, the total number of listed companies
reached 501, up from 53 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The regulatory bodies have recently intensified supervision of
the market, to curb increasing irregular activities, the
commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Since July 24, a series of notices or regulations have been
issued to crack down on such activities, including the overdrawing
of funds, trust tradings, and attempts to manipulate the market. A
special notice calling for the increase of risk management and
education has also been issued.
</P>
<P>
The government has also dealt with a number of the cases of
illegal activities. Leading officials in two banks responsible for
the irregularities were punished, and 44 securities companies were
warned and fined. The two stock exchanges also were criticized for
engaging in activities violating regulations.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Calls for Risk Awareness of Stock Market (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commentary calls on departments concerned to increase
supervision of the market in order to halt over-speculation, based
on the principle of "intensified supervision, increased supply,
proper guidance, and maintaining stability".
</P>
<P>
A nationwide investigation will be carried out to spot illegal
and irregular activities in stock trading. The investigation is
intended to stop bank capital from flowing into the stock market,
crack down on major market players who are manipulating the
market, forbid securities companies from overdrawing money to give
to their clients, and severely punish inside tradings. Stock
exchanges are urged to focus primarily on supervision rather than
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, cases of irregularities will continue to be dealt
with publicly. For example, departments concerned have decided to
confiscate all the illegal gains made by the Zhangjiajie Tourism
Development Co. Ltd. in central China's Hunan Province from stock
trading, and will impose a fine on the company and issue disciplinary
sanctions against those responsible for the activities.
</P>
<P>
And the two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen will make
more information public to increase the transparency of the
market.
</P>
<P>
A system prohibiting certain people from dealing in stocks will
be established, stipulating that senior executives of securities
companies and individuals, if found guilty of illegal or irregular
activities in stock trading, will be barred from entering the
business in the future.
</P>
<P>
Risk management also will be enhanced. Stock exchanges,
securities settlement companies, and securities companies will
work to prevent problems from cropping up in the trading,
settlement and registration systems to guarantee the safety of the
market operation.
</P>
<P>
More new stocks will be listed on the market. The state today
announced the total amount of new stocks to be issued by efficient
major state-owned enterprises in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Illegal publications will be banned, and reports on the stock
market and stock commentaries are forbidden to fabricate or
spread false information. Regulations on management of securities
consultation services will be promulgated soon.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the commentary calls for a centralized and
integrated management system of the stock market. Local
departments should keep in line with policies pursued by the
central authorities to maintain market order and social
stability.

KUWAIT, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister

steps have been taken to abolish the system of middle men in arms

</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Kuwaiti news agency (KUNA), Sheikh Salem

<HEADLINE> ANC to offer Special Amnesty for Kwazulu/Natal killers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 15 (Xinhua)--The ruling African National
Congress (ANC) of South Africa is pushing for a special amnesty for
Killers responsible for political violence in Kwazulu/Natal
Province, local newspaper Sunday Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
ANC is hoping that an amnesty deal, which will involve a new
cut-off date for the province, will finally end the 13-year war in
the region, which has claimed 14,000 lives, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, following warming-up ties between ANC and Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) Leaders earkuer this year, also aimed at
bringing the IFP into the amnsty process, which IFP has largely
boycotted because it regares the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
(TRC) as a "witch-hunt" against opponents of the ANC.
</P>
<P>
TRC is a special committee formed by the Mandela government to be
in charge of human rights violation cases left over by history.
</P>
<P>
Kwazulu/Natal, one of nine provinces in South Africa, has been a
"hot spot" where ANC and IFP engaged in long confrontation resulted
from acute political differences.
</P>
<P>
ANC officials said that details of the amnesty for killers in
Kwazulu/Natal Province are being discussed, adding the province will
need a new cut-off date for amnesty applicants as conflicts in the
province goes beyond May 10, 1994, which, as President Nelson
Mandela announced on Friday, is the deadline for people who involved
themselves in violence and qualify for amnesty.

<HEADLINE> Cease-Fire Monitors to Discuss Israel's Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A five-nation committee
monitoring a limited truce on the Lebanese-Israeli border will
discuss Monday a complaint filed by Israel over a Friday katyusha
offensive on northern Israel, Lebanese official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources from the Foreign Ministry said that the
cease-fire monitoring committee comprising France, the United
States, Syria, Lebanon and Israel is to hold a meeting at
the south Lebanese border town of Naqoura at an Israeli
request.
</P>
<P>
Israel lodged a complaint with the committee over what the
Jewish state called a "breach of the April cease-fire
understanding," under which the five-nation monitoring group was
set up, the official sources said in condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Michel Gaussot, the Cyprus-based French chairman of the
committee, has called on the five nation's delegates to attend
the meeting in the headquarters of the U.N. peace-keeping
forces at Naqoura in south Lebanon at 11:00 a.m. (09:00 GMT)
Monday, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokesman claimed earlier that three Katyusha
rockets fired from an area close to the south Lebanese port city
of Sour (Tyre) landed in northern Israel Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Brokered by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, the
cease-fire understanding ended a 17-day Israeli blitz in south
Lebanon in April, which claimed some 200 Lebanese lives, mostly
civilians.
</P>
<P>
According to the understanding, guerrilla groups operating in
south Lebanon are barred from firing Katyusha rockets onto
northern Israel, and civilians on both sides of the border
are demanded to be kept separated from military activities.
</P>
<P>
However, the understanding allows Lebanese guerrillas to launch
attacks at Israeli occupation forces and Israeli-backed Lebanese
militia in south Lebanon, and gives the Israeli forces and
the militia the "right of self-defense."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government has sent a military fact-finding team
to the border area in order to find out who fired the Katyusha
rockets.

its ability to solve the nation's most pervasive problems, a
loosely formed social movement promoting a return to "civil

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Reaffirms Jordan's Rejection of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan has
reiterated Jordan's rejection of Israel's settlement policy in
the occupied Palestinian territories, Jordan Times reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Our stand regarding this issue is quite clear and it's
similar to the world's position, which considers the settlement
as illegal and illegitimate," he said.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein made the remarks Saturday while inspecting the
military equipment which the United States provided as defense
security aid to Jordan and was being unloaded from the USS Cape
Wrath which docked at the Aqaba port last week.
</P>
<P>
"As to the peace process, we sincerely hope that all parties
will remain committed not only to all agreements signed by
previous governments of the region but also to implementing these
commitments," said Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Jordan clarified its position on Israel's new settlement
policy Friday when Information Minister Marwan Muasher said that
serious differences arose between Jordan and Israel over the
planned expansion of Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"I've clarified the Jordanian position regarding the
settlements and stressed that this constituted a threat to the
peace process," said Muasher.
</P>
<P>
"There are big differences between the Jordanian and Israeli
perspectives on the issue of settlements," Muasher said after
his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Muasher's remarks coincided with an Israeli government
decision Friday to give tax breaks and generous grants to Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The decision would likely boost construction and investment
in the 144 settlements. The Palestinians sharply opposed
settlement expansion and warned it would lead to the collapse of
Mideast peace efforts.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Warns Against US Breach of Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi deputy Premier Tariq
Aziz said here today that as long as U.S. and its allies'
warplanes fly over Iraqi air space, it means a breach of Iraqi
sovereignty and a threat to the security of his country.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made the remarks while commenting on a Turkish decision
made a few months ago on renewing the mandate of the Force Hammer
of the U.S. and its allies until the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
"We have never noticed any such modification because the
U.S. and its allies' warplanes have continued to breach Iraqi
airspace," he said in a reference to a statement by Turkish
officials that Turkey had made some modifications to the mission
of the Force Hammer.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi News Agency quoted Aziz as saying that the illegal flight
over northern Iraq was and still is the basic mission of the Force
Hammer.
</P>
<P>
He accused those who release such statements of seeking to hide
the truth from the Turkish public opinion.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of 1991 gulf war which drove Iraqi forces out of
Kuwait after a seven-month occupation, the U.S. and its allies
have stationed forces on Turkish soil to deal with any possible
precarious situation in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Cut Customs Duties on Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's customs duties on cars
would be reduced by 40 percent from January 1, 1997, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in customs duties for cars came in line with
Jordan's internal moves to make the country's tariff structure
more compatible with the requirements of a partnership agreement
with the European Union (EU) and the kingdom's accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO), Jordan Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and the EU will sign a partnership agreement in early
1997. The kingdom has already started accession negotiations with
the WTO, which advocates tariff-free trade among its members.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Planning Secretary-General Nabil Ammari said on
Thursday that the government could not simply afford to lose the
revenues from customs duties and it was imperative that the
reduction had to be offset by additional taxes.
</P>
<P>
There would be several structures of the new customs tariffs
on cars, but the reduction will be roughly 40 percent, an official
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Several countries, including the United States, are pressuring
Jordan to revamp the customs duties structure on vehicles. They
are demanding that the duties be set on an across-the-board basis
rather than the present slab structure based on the engine size
-- cars with small-size engine pay a lower percentage while those
with higher engine sizes will pay as high as 200 percent.

<HEADLINE> Iran Lashes Out at US for "Evil Designs" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran's hardline parliament
speaker today attacked the United States for the evil designs
for the region.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is trying to level charges against Iran in
a bid to reach its own evil design and objectives," Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri said at the open session of the parliament this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri's attack on the United States came a day after
Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei warned the U.S. that Iran
would destabilize the region in the case of a U.S. attack in
retaliation for what the American press have called Iranian
involvement in bombing a U.S. military base in Saudi Arabia last
June.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader told thousands of revolutionary guards
Saturday morning that "the evidence shows that the present
government in the United States is apparently planning to teach
Iran a lesson."
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri, a leading presidential candidate for next year's
elections, said that aliens' presence would not bring calm and
stability to the region but would heighten tension and foment
unrest.
</P>
<P>
He said the Gulf littoral states did not like to accept the
reality that the U.S. has only disgraced them, plundered their
money and stirred unrest.
</P>
<P>
"Establishment of stability and security in the Persian Gulf
is possible solely through cooperation among the regional states
and on non-intervention of foreign forces in the region," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added that the region should be secure for all, or else
there will be no security for anybody.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the Gulf littoral states not to trust aliens
because the U.S. was not their friend and that they themselves
should care for their national interests.

HONG KONG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Over 2,000 people from
various circles in Kowloon gathered at Hung Hom Stadium here today
to mark the 200-day countdown to Hong Kong's return to the embrace
of the motherland on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
At the gathering, Zheng Guoxiong, deputy director of Xinhua
News Agency Hong Kong Branch, noted that on the coming election of
the Provisional Legislative Council, he believes the election will
be conducted on a fair and just basis.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Selection Committee for the first government
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) will take
into account Hong Kong people's overall interests and Hong Kong's
smooth transition in choosing the members for the council.
</P>
<P>
After the gathering, more than 2,000 people walked from Hung
Hom Stadium to the Hong Kong Culture Center at Tsim Sha Tsui
carrying slogans focusing on the 200-day countdown to Hong Kong's
handover. On the way, they let 200 pigeons fly into the sky to
mark the 200th day in the countdown.
</P>
<P>
At the Hong Kong Culture Center, there were varieties of
performances involving singing, dancing and instrumental music
reserved for the 200-day countdown celebrations.

<HEADLINE> Cairo International Festival Honors Egypt's Cinema </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has attained two awards at
the 20th Cairo International Festival while the country's
doldrums-ridden film industry marks its centennial.
</P>
<P>
"Apple," a touching story of a poor couple's life in the
turmoils of love and lust, garnered Golden Pyramid for the best
film at the festival which drew an official close here on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian actor Abu Bakr Ezzat captured the prize for Best Actor
for his outstanding performance in "The Woman and the Hatchet,"
which is based on a true story of family crimes.
</P>
<P>
The two Egyptian entrants in the competitions tend to explore
family dramas and show the personal perspective of larger issues
than focus on characters and mood and sound-track build-up, said
local critics.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 12 movies were competing for the festival's seven
prizes, which also included the prizes for best actress,
script, direction, the best Arab film and the Special Jury Prize.
</P>
<P>
The Greek film "Acrople," directed by Pantelis Voulgaris, was
given the best direction award.
</P>
<P>
Naguib Mahfouz Prize, named after the 85-year-old Egyptian
Nobel laureate writer for the first best film, went to the French
film "Will There Be Snow at Christmas", a complicated family
drama unfolding the French countryside.
</P>
<P>
Russian director Nikita Mikhaikov won the Gold Pyramid prize,
while a Czech and Hungarian directors shared the Silver Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
Actress Julia Jager carried away the Prize for Best Actress in
Germany's "Outside Time", a love story between a Russian soldier
and a German woman.
</P>
<P>
"Nicholas Church" from Germany, based on a novel by Erich
Loest, got the best script award, while Algeria's "Hey Cousin"
gained the Special Jury Prize.
</P>
<P>
The best Arab film award of 30,000 U.S. dollars was given to a
Palestinian film "Haifa" for its true-picture depiction of the
miserable life in a Gaza refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
China entered the competition with "Red Swan," a production
that recounts the dramatic live of a promising ballerina, blending
impressive natural scenery with artistry and a touching
story. Another feature "Red Cherry" was also on the show.
</P>
<P>
An approximate 200 films, including dozens of movies never
shown before, from 55 countries, graced the festival running
through 2-15 December.
</P>
<P>
The films, some subtitled, feature a blend of new releases and
dear classics. They reveal a world of cultural and artistic
differences, as well as varieties of style and in content.
</P>
<P>
The 20th Cairo International Film Festival coincides with the
centennial of the Arab and Egyptian cinema, which currently
caters to 300,000 Arab audiences.
</P>
<P>
The first Arab film was made in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1896
with the help of French filmmaking pioneers the Lumiere Brothers
about a month after the first Lumiere film was made in France.
</P>
<P>
A hundred years later, Egypt, the largest movie producer in
Arab countries, however, undergoes depression. Currently there are
170 cinemas functioning in the 26 governorates of the country,
while 212 others have been shut down.
</P>
<P>
It turned out less than 10 cinema productions and films this
year and film makers blamed the poor script, unqualified cast and
rising costs due to high taxes for the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
Sa'd ud-Din Wahba, president of the festival, predicted that
the declining Egyptian film industry would survive despite all the
complaints. "It is not dying and it will witness a rebound," he
told the festival's closing ceremony on Saturday night.

GUANGZHOU, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China today began trial
operations of its first digital audio broadcasting (DAB) network
in the city of Foshan, marking a watershed in the development of
China's radio broadcasting system.
</P>
<P>
DAB is a new global technology which offers strong resistance
to disturbance, and a broader coverage and broadcasting
capacity. Only Germany, France, Britain, Australia and the US
presently have DAB capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The DAB network will be helpful in promoting the digitalization
of broadcasting in Hong Kong and Macao, said He Dongcai,
vice-minister of the Radio, Film, and TV, at the opening ceremony
of today's DAB testing. About 500 representatives from China and
overseas attended the event in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The network will help to open a channel for cooperation and
exchange among the Zhujiang Delta, Hong Kong, and Macao, and to
promote the common prosperity of these areas, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Think Similarly in Health, Family, Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Good health, a happy family
life and a successful career are the three most common desires
shared by Chinese people between the ages of 19 and 61, according
to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Beijing Social Psychology
Institute, received nearly 10,000 response sheets from people
polled.
</P>
<P>
The results showed that while Chinese people's values and ways
of thinking have changed in many respects over the past 18 years,
since the country began reform and opening up to the outside
world, some things never change, especially when it comes to
marriage, family and careers.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that people of different ages, gender, and
educational backgrounds fundamentally agreed with each other on
the ingredients for a happy marriage: over 80 percent of the
respondents believed that "sharing weal and woe" and "trusting in
each other" make for the most successful union. However, financial
success, family status, appearance, and sex life were not
considered by those surveyed to be as important as in past years.
</P>
<P>
When questioned if children should demonstrate their love for
and respect to their parents, more than half of those polled
emphatically answered "yes."
</P>
<P>
A noticeable difference in philosophy was apparent when people
were asked whether parents should make decisions for their
underage children.
</P>
<P>
People under the age of 35 tended to say "no," while those over
35 most often answered "yes." The majority of people between the
ages of 36 and 45 agreed that parents should always be the
decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
Work that can fully display one's capability was the first
factor people of all age groups considered when choosing jobs, the
survey showed.

<HEADLINE> Iran Criticizes GCC's Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian foreign minister Ali
Akbar Velayati today criticized the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
for issuing "threatening, futile and useless statement" on
disputed island in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
He said that the December 9 statement, which supports the
United Arab Emirates in island disputes with Iran, won't help
restore the spirit of trust in the Persian Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister made the remark while meeting with
the visiting Kuwaiti Deputy Foreign Minister Sulaiman Majid
al-Shahin, who heads a ranking political delegation from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"The issuance of such repetitive statement does not serve the
resolution of the problems," he was quoted by the state-run Tehran
Radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the problems between Iran and the UAE could be
solved only through "understanding, cooperation and dialog."
</P>
<P>
The three Iranian-held islands of Abu Musa, Lesser Tunb and
Greater Tunb are claimed by the UAE. The islands are
strategically located on the verge of the Strait of Hormuz in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has said that it will take their dispute with
Iran before the International Court of Justice in the Hague, but
Iran rejected the demand.
</P>
<P>
Velayati also called on countries in the region to maintain "the
stability, security and the development of the sensitive Persian
Gulf region."
</P>
<P>
He said that preserving the security and stability of "the
sensitive and vital Persian Gulf is one of the basic priorities"
of the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the issuance of the GCC's statement, Iran's
Foreign Ministry Tuesday severely condemned the stance taken by
the Gulf Cooperation Council toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
GCC's final statement also expressed concern over Iran's
deployment of missiles in the region, saying it "poses a threat to
the security and stability of neighboring states."
</P>
<P>
In a response, Iran's Foreign Ministry stated that it is
the legitimate right for Iran to guarantee security in the
Persian Gulf as an important international waterway.
</P>
<P>
In an indirect reference to the United States, Velayati
said, foreign powers "falsely call the grand and powerful
Islamic Republic of Iran" a threat to the security of the
region so as to justify the sales of arms and "their
illegitimate presence" in the region.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Structural Reforms Stagnating India's Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- India must not flinch from
imperative measures such as undertaking structural reforms to
attract private investment in thorted, citing the study.
</P>
<P>
The study report was drafted by a high-level Japanese
delegation after its visit to India to have a first-hand knowledge
of the power industry and of possible investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the absence of a fundamental
prerequisite for privatization, without which it is not possible
to attract private capital, is causing stagnation in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Structural reform requires state governments to make
politically difficult decisions, for they involve revision of
legal and legislative proceedings, elimination of political
intervention, drastic normalization of tariff structure and
creation of an independent regulatory commission.

<HEADLINE> Lower Levels of Yellow River Worsen NW China's Power Shortages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The already short supply of
electricity in the northwestern part of the country will be
worsened as a result of the lowering water levels of the Yellow
River, China's second largest, according to a report in the
"Guangming Daily."
</P>
<P>
Authorities predict that in the period from this October
through next May, hydro-electricity generated by the Northwest
Power Grid will be reduced by 660 million kilowatt hours (kwh),
representing a decrease of 6.6 percent compared with the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
This will cause the severe shortage of electricity in northwest
China, the Beijing-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The diminished water source in the upper reaches of the Yellow
River has lasted for four consecutive years; this year, the river
has experienced the worst dry season on record.
</P>
<P>
In the high water season from June to September, water
contained in the Longyangxia Reservoir on the river was only half
of the average amount of past years, it said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October, the water levels in the Liujiaxia and
Longyangxia reservoirs were 2.84 and 4.99 meters lower than a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Northwest Power Grid has a deficiency of 10
billion kwh of electricity annually.

<HEADLINE> Cutting of Natural Forests to Be Decreased From Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China will gradually stop the
cutting of natural forests from next year by developing and using
more man-made forest areas, the Ministry of Forestry announced.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made following the close of the annual
meeting of the Ministry of Forestry, which ended on here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Forestry Minister Xu Youfang said that
beginning next year, some 15 to 20 percent of artificial forests
throughout the country will be intensively managed to make up for
the cutting of natural forests, which are currently the country's
primary source of timber.
</P>
<P>
"Forest farms in Inner Mongolia and in southwest China will
take the lead in carrying out this new reform," he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics shows that in recent years, more than 20 million
hectares of new forests have been planted nationwide, many of
which were completed with the aid of World Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
"Management will be improved to ensure that the growing of new
forests will play a leading role in protecting the nation's
natural forest resources," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> China to Implement International Ship Safety System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A safety management system to
supervise all ships in China engaged in the international shipping
business has been put into effect by the China Classification
Society (CCS).
</P>
<P>
Ships that do not qualify to receive a CCS safety management
certificate will be barred from shipping worldwide, according to a
recent meeting on safety management certification held in Yichang,
central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The International Safety Management Regulations issued by the
International Maritime Organization (IMO) stipulate that all ships
involved in international shipping, and the companies that run
them, must be assessed, verified, and granted safety management
certificates before July 1, 1998, or before July 1, 2002, in order
to continue their business activities.
</P>
<P>
CCS, a member and this year's president of the International
Association of Classification Societies (IASC), has been entrusted
by nine IASC members including China, Liberia, Panama and
Singapore, to review the implementation of the regulations that
affect their ships.
</P>
<P>
CCS established a ship safety management assessing department
in 1995, according to the group's vice president He Jinyao. The
society has provided consultation services on the safety
management system for 50 shipping companies, both in China and
overseas.

<P>
TIANJIN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- World champion Kong Linghui
completed China's clean sweep of the four titles in the ITTF Table
Tennis Professional Tour Finals here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Kong, ranked fourth in the world, took the
men's singles title and a cash prize of 34,000 U.S. dollars after
beating world No. 5 Vladimir Samsonov from Belarus 21-13, 14-21,
21-18, 21-18.
</P>
<P>
World top women player Deng Yaping was teamed up with Yang Ying
to win the doubles top honors early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Deng got her first title after nipping teammate Li
Ju in the women's singles final and Wang Liqin and Yan Sen
overcame Samsonov and Germany's Jorg Rosskopf to win the men's
doubles trophy.
</P>
<P>
Kong, who has recently fallen from the top spot in the world
rankings after a string of unimpressive performances, regained his
form to beat two top European players in a day.
</P>
<P>
In the semi-finals, Kong routed world No.8 Rosskopf 21-15,
21-12, 21-14 as he broke the German's rhythm with forehand attacks
and backhand flat shots.
</P>
<P>
Kong used the same tactics in the final, forcing Samsonov to
make a lot of forehand errors.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov moved into the final with a four-set win over Vasile
Florea of Romania, ranked 30th in the world.
</P>
<P>
Deng Yaping and Yang Ying, who paired up to win the French Open
and Swedish Open last month, rallied to beat South Korea's Park
Hae Jung and Ryu Ji Hye 17-21, 21-16, 21-12, 21-12.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese duo pocketed a purse of 6,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the semi-finals, Deng and Yang beat teammates Wang Hui and
Cheng Hongxia 21-16, 21-13, 21-6, while Park and Ryu defeated
countrywomen Kim Myo Anne and Park Kyung Ae 21-10, 21-13, 21-12.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time in one and an half year that China has
swept all titles in big event.
</P>
<P>
China walked away with all seven titles in the world
championships in May last year and then swept all four gold medals
in the Olympic Games this summer.
</P>
<P>
"Clean sweep doesn't mean China holds an advantage over the
rest of the world," said Xu Yingsheng, chief of the Chinese table
tennis association.
</P>
<P>
Xu, also president of the world sport governing body ITTF, said
European players have honed their skill in placement shot and top
spin play and they can challenge their Chinese counterparts
anytime, anywhere.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen to Set up International Container Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Comprehensive design plans
for an intermodal cargo container shipping center in Shenzhen have
been approved by authorities, who believe the project will play an
important role in promoting transport between the city and
neighboring Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The South China International Cargo Container Intermodal
Transport Center has been officially okayed by experts from the
Ministry of Communications, the State Economic and Trade
Commission and the China Communications and Transportation
Association, as one of the ten basic projects to support the
increase of shipping between Shenzhen, in south China's Guangdong
Province, and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
As a port of entry on land, the center will provide services
ranging from cargo transshipping and warehousing to cargo
container shipping, and will act as an international cargo agent
and supply information management.
</P>
<P>
When the first phase of the center is completed in 2003, it is
expected to have an annual handling capacity of 879,000 TEUs,
which will be expanded to about two million TEUs by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the world's leading container port, and Shenzhen
has bright prospects as a supporting base to provide cargo
warehousing, transshipping and inspection services for the
neighboring city, an official with the city's transportation
bureau said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Shenzhen's own container transport has been
growing steadily in recent years: the container berths of the
Shenzhen port presently have a total handling capacity of 650,000
TEUs, and are expected to take in more than 400,000 TEUs of
containers this year.
</P>
<P>
The official said Shenzhen is also trying to channel more
overseas investment into its transport infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Summit on Zaire Crisis to Be held in Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi will tomorrow host the third-round regional summit on the
Zaire crisis, according to a Sunday Times report today.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela will attend the summit
of the Heads of State and government of countries in the East
African Great lakes region here next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Former Tanzanian President Mwalimu Julius Nyerere and
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Secretary General Salim Ahmed
Salim are expected here this afternoon to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A regional summit held here on November 5 called for an
immediate cease-fire and deployment of a neutral peacekeeping
force in Eastern Zaire to intervene in fighting between the Tutsi
rebels and Zairean troops which trapped over one million Rwandan
Hutu refugees there.
</P>
<P>
Since then, refugee camps in Eastern Zaire which provided home
to some 1.2 million people have broken up and more than 500,000
Rwandan refugees have returned home.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Canadian units in a multinational force
for Eastern Zaire were ordered to close down and pull out of
Rwanda and their main base in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
However, in his speech marking Kenya's 33rd independence day
on December 12, President Moi said, "the growing tension between
Zaire and her neighbors continues to worsen day by day."
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper "The East African" earlier reported that a
summit meeting was scheduled to be held in Nairobi in mid
December to discuss the lifting of economic sanctions imposed
upon the Burundi military regime which seized power on July 25
this year.

from trouble in the country (Zaire). Such people we just send back
to Zaire and we come across such cases from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
Zambian authorities have tightened security along the border
areas with Zaire to avoid a full-scale influx of the ''fake''
rfugees and criminals.
</P>
<P>
''We have a process to detect who is who because you cannot
consider some one, say, from Lubumbashi (of Zaire) to be a
refugee when the disturbances are concentrated in eastern Zaire.
At this point we have no choice but to hand over such people back
to the Zairean authorities,'' officials at Sasumbalesa said.

<HEADLINE> Air Controllers end Go-slow in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The week-long go-slow action
by Kenyan air traffic controllers has come to an end following a
back-to-work formula reached in a tripartite consultative talks
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Standard said today that the striking air
controllers agreed to resume work at 18:00 hours p.m. local
time on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of striking staff attending the talks set
their conditions for resuming work, Which include that in
addition to no victimization, their demands would be addressed by
the end of January.
</P>
<P>
They declared that if the civil aviation authority failed to
do so by late January, they would resort to industrial actions
again.
</P>
<P>
Fares kuindwa, Permanent Secretary in the Office of the
President and Head of Civil Service, who brokered the talks,
promised to urgently address the grievances of the air traffic
controllers and other aviation staff.
</P>
<P>
A meeting held last Friday between Permanent Secretary for
Transport and Communication Stanley Murage and the striking staff
reached deadlock, resulting in the announcement of sacking the
striking controllers.
</P>
<P>
The go-slow action started on the evening of December 7,
leading to flight delays and heavy losses in the aviation
industry during the past week.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Troops to Leave Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian United Nations'
multinational force (UNMNF) for Zaire will start to leave Uganda
tomorrow or Tuesday, a spokesman has said.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Colonel Rejean Dechesneau, spokesman of Canadian UNMNF
told ''the Sunday Vision'' paper yesterday that the mission will
close by the end of this year, and flight arrangements are in
progress.
</P>
<P>
Lt. General maurice Baril, the force's commander, left Uganda
for New York on Wednesday to brief the U.N. on the situation in
east Zaire and discuss the future role of the MNF.
</P>
<P>
A political decision on the future of the force was due to be
announced at the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
The 300-men Canadian UNMNF came to Uganda on a humanitarian
mission to secure international aid agencies to operate in
Eastern Zaire as refugees there required.
</P>
<P>
Uganda welcomed the mission, but Zaire and Rwanda expressed
their skeptism on the role of the UNMNf. Lt. Colonel Duchesneau
said in the interview that if non-government organizations in the
region felt it was not necessary to have armed escort, the
Canadian UNMNF troops would pack up and return home.
</P>
<P>
The first group of the MNf arrived in Uganda on mid-November
as the U.S. Security Council so decided.

BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China has mapped out a plan to
issue 10 billion-yuan-worth stocks in 1996, doubling last year's
figure, the State Planning Commission and the Securities Committee
of the State Council announced today.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to support the listing of key large and

year.
</P>
<P>
China's securities watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, will decide how many enterprises will be listed.
</P>
<P>
This move will help to promote the sound development of the
Chinese stock market, and to encourage major state-owned
enterprises to raise funds through the stock market and and to
shift their operating mechanism.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Receives Massive U.S. Military Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has received 100 million
U.S. dollars worth of U.S. military equipment as part of
Washington's defense security aid to the kingdom, Jordan Times
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein, also the supreme commander of the Jordanian Armed
Forces, inspected the equipment as it was being unloaded from the
USS Cape Wrath which docked at the Aqaba port last week.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference aboard the U.S. ship, Hussein described
the U.S. aid as "firm and true indication of the fact that we are
friends and that we stand together."
</P>
<P>
Included in the equipment were 18 UH-1H helicopters, 50 M60A3
tanks, 250 M1008 and M1009 trucks, two MK-4 personnel boats and an
air-sea rescue vessel as well as machine guns and 1,000 pairs of
night vision goggles.
</P>
<P>
The equipment represented the 300 million dollars worth of
assistance program signed by U.S. President Clinton last February,
and was part of the U.S. military program to provide defense
articles, services and training to friendly countries, according
to the United States Information Service (USIS).
</P>
<P>
The military assistance to Jordan was pledged by Clinton around
the time Jordan and Israel signed a peace treaty in October 1994
and was separate from the annual defense aid and funding for joint
training programs of the armed forces of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The remainder was 200 million dollars worth of 16 F-16 jet
fighters which will be delivered by the end of 1997, Jordan Times
reported.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, a C-130H aircraft would be delivered to the
Royal Jordanian Air Force by next March, U.S. Ambassador to the
kingdom Wesley Egan said, quoted by the Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
Egan said the equipment would bolster Jordan's fighting
capabilities to confront what he called continuing threats to the
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The United States looks to Jordan as one of the most
important, constructive and moderate forces for peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is still a region in which there are real threats
 ... The ability of the Jordanian Armed Forces to meet those
threats ... is the fundamental rationale for the provision of
this military equipment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some unidentified U.S. officials said the military aid to
Jordan this year also included around 25 million dollars worth of
equipment supplied under a regular Excess Defense Articles (EDA)
program, including 500 trucks, rifles and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
Clinton granted Jordan in November, 1996 the status of a
non-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
This has entitled Jordan for "priority consideration" for its
requests for defense needs and to receive advanced U.S. military
equipment and technology.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is expected soon to present to the U.S. a list of
equipment and technology as well as services that it wants to have
as part of the kingdom's program to modernize and upgrade its
armed forces, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
However, the size of the U.S. aid package to Jordan is still
modest compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars of
military assistance granted by Washington to Israel and Egypt,
Jordan Times reported.

LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times
</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair, the Labor Party leader, has rejected Tory claims
that he would be a "soft touch" in Europe, promising Saturday that
a Labor government would adopt a sceptical stance and maintain
Britain's veto in key areas.
</P>
<P>
The Observer
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations is heading in a radically different
direction under the leadership of its new Secretary-General,
Ghana's Kofi Annan, who told the Observer that the UN's current
rock-bottom relations with the United States, its principal
paymaster, were set to improve and that the credibility of the
organisation would be restored.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph
</P>
<P>
-- The triumphalism over the great Franco-German EMU compromise
in Dublin this weekend has successfully disguised the fact that
Paris and Bonn remain bitterly divided over how the new system
will work.
</P>
<P>
Independent on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- The outcome of the British general election is absolutely
crucial to the future of the whole of Europe, the Dutch foreign
minister warned Saturday at the close of the Dublin summit, as the
Netherlands took over the European Union presidency.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Attack Hezbollah's Bases in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes carried out
this morning an air strike at guerrilla bases of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the Syrian-controlled Beqaa valley
in southeast Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the area reported that Israeli fighter
jets launched the air raid at 9:45 a.m. (07:45 GMT) at Hezbollah
bases in Western Beqaa where Syrian deploys one third of its
35,000-strong forces in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli warplanes made three dive bombings at the targets
and fired more than six air-to-surface missiles at the villages of
Bark Jabour, Jebal Rashid and Eid Tini, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
But no word on casualties and damages was available.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese army sources in the southern port city of Sour
reported that Israeli reconnaissance planes hovered over the
city and the market town of Nabatiyeh in the central sector of
south Lebanon since 10:00 a.m. (08:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Today' attack came a day after guerrillas of Hezbollah tried
to ambush an Israeli patrol in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army sources in Jerusalem confirmed today that a
senior Israeli army officer was slightly injured in the ambush
by the Lebanese guerrillas at an Israeli convoy in the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia (SLA),
 which patrols the buffer zone in the border area, reported that
the guerrillas detonated a mine on the road between Aishiyeh and
Rihan, when the Israeli convoy comprising three vehicles was
passing by.
</P>
<P>
One guerrilla was killed in the following clash between the
Israeli force and the attackers, in which the two sides used
machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, according to the SLA
sources.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
claimed responsibility for the operation, but did not make any
mention of the casualties.
</P>
<P>
High tensions have prevailed south Lebanon since Israel
announced that three katyusha rockets landed in the Galilee
panhandle in northern Israel Friday night without causing human
or material losses.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer buffer enclave,
stretching from the Mediterranean coast to the west eastward to
Mont Hermon, in 1985 in a bid to protect north Israel from
crossing-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> New Fire-Extinguishing System Developed In Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have
developed a new fire-extinguishing system, reported the Jerusalem
Post today.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech system, developed by Professor Eran Scher of
Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, south Israel, is based on
electrodes that produce an electrical field in the burning area
that puts out the flames.
</P>
<P>
The electrical field causes the fire to be extinguished in the
most optimal and efficient way without contaminants or liquids
that would be especially dangerous in an enclosed space vehicle.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. astronaut and scientist, Paul Ronay, recently visited
Scher's lab to see the system and to plan for testing in
space.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Aeronautics and Space Administration is especially
interested in seeing how electrical fields can extinguish fires in
an environment that lacks gravity, the newspaper report said.

<P>
TOKYO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Flight crews of All Nippon

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Rebuff Extradition Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority
(PA) has reiterated its outright rejection of requests by Israel
to extradite Palestinian militant suspects, Israel Radio reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Palestinian security service in the West
Bank, Jibril Rajoub, told the radio that the PA will retain
its sovereignty and thus will never hand over Palestinians to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
His remark was an apparent response to a decision taken at the
weekly Israeli cabinet session Friday to request the PA to hand
over to Israel all terrorist suspects detained in the autonomous
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli decision came after a bloody incident near
Ramallah in the West Bank Wednesday night, in which a woman
settler Etta Tzur and her 12-year-old son were killed by
Palestinian gunmen. Her husband, Yoel, and four other children
aged four to 17 were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Damascus-based PLO faction the Popular Front for
Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) claimed responsibility for the
drive-by shooting attack. The assailants were reported to make way
to Ramallah after the attack.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Rajoub said, the Palestinian security service will
hand over to Israel pictures of the PFLP activists who were
arrested in connection with the incident. Yoel will be able to
identify the suspects who shot his car.
</P>
<P>
According to the Government Press Office (GPO), Israel has so
far requested the transfer of 27 suspected terrorists -- 17
formally and 10 informally, but the PA has consistently refused.
</P>
<P>
Israel claims that the extradition of terrorists is a section
of the Oslo Accords, but the Palestinians say the matter is
absolutely under the PA jurisdiction.

<HEADLINE> India Finds New Use for Medical CT-scan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A widely-used medical
imaging technique, computed tomography or CT, is finding new use
in testing carbon composites used for India's advanced light
helicopter (ALH) that is being developed, Press Trust of India
said today.
</P>
<P>
Indian aeronautics scientists reported at a world conference on
non-destructive testing held here that they had been using a
medical CT scanner to test composite parts fabricated for the ALH
project, where prototypes are undergoing flights tests.
</P>
<P>
CT, which was first introduced in 1971 as a powerful method of
X-ray diagnosis, is emerging as a powerful tool for
non-destructive testing of industrial materials such as plastics,
rubbers and composite materials whose densities are close to those
of human tissues and bones, they said.
</P>
<P>
Non-destructive testing helps assess quality of products and
take corrective action, thus assuring the quality of aerospace
components and structures that require high levels of safety and
reliability.
</P>
<P>
CT is especially gaining importance in aviation and automobile
industries where metals are getting replaced by reinforced polymer
composites to reduce12

Ningxia also encourages non-government organizations in cities
and better-off areas to help open more "Spring Bud" classes for
drop-outs. So far, dozens of organizations and over 3,000
individuals have donated money for running classes for rural
girls.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A delegation from the African
National Congress of South Africa (ANC) headed by Deputy Secretary
General Cheryl Carolus left here today after a five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was the first of its kind to visit China after
the birth of the new South Africa. It also came soon after
President Nelson Mandela's announcement that his country will
establish diplomatic ties with China by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
In May Chinese President Jiang Zemin paid a state visit to six
African nations, starting from East Africa's Kenya. His
counter-clockwise tour around the continent also covered Ethiopia
-- location of the OAU headquarters -- northern Africa's Egypt,
western Africa's Mali and southern Africa's Namibia and Zimbabwe
-- the two wings of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
One quarter of the more than 40 heads of state and prime
ministers that visited China this year came from African
countries. In addition, a dozen foreign ministers from Africa and
the Middle East visited China.
</P>
<P>
China's hosting of the 96th Inter-Parliamentary Conference in
September provided a chance for many African parliamentary leaders
to visit this country.
</P>
<P>
These events are evidence of major progress in the traditional
friendly relations between China and Africa. This is regarded as a
prominent feature in China's diplomatic activities this year.

<P>
Exchanges between China and South Africa at all levels have
attracted attention worldwide. Since February the South African
Communist Party and some non-governmental organizations have sent
delegations to China. Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo also made a trip
to China.
</P>
<P>
Mandela announced in late November that South Africa will sever
diplomatic ties with Taiwan, and establish full diplomatic
relations with the People's Republic of China by the end of
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
A permanent continuation of diplomatic recognition of Taiwan is
inconsistent with South Africa's role in international affairs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's stance was welcomed by China, and was viewed as the
fruit of China's consistent efforts in carrying out a correct
diplomatic strategy.
</P>
<P>
The China trip of the ANC delegation was designed to cultivate
closer ties with the Communist Party of China, deepen
understanding between the two countries and enhance the
development of Sino-South African ties.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three decades Chinese leaders visited African
nations dozens of times, and leaders from 48 African nations
visited China.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Africa, President Jiang set out a five-point
proposal for all-round development of Sino-African ties with an
eye to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
China holds that the coming century will be the "development
century" for Africa. China, as the largest developing country in
the world, hopes to have sincere friendship with the African
nations, and seek common growth and close cooperation, becoming
"all-weather friends".
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Mahmoud Zouabi became the first Syrian prime
minister to visit China since the two countries forged diplomatic
relations 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
His China trip is another important event in the exchange of
high-level visits between China and Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,
China has all along backed the Middle East peace process, and has
made its due contribution in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Through exchanges with such a country of influence as Syria,
China will further its cooperation with the international
community, and promote the full implementation of relevant UN
resolutions and a fair and reasonable solution to the Middle East
issue at an early date.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Distillers Urged to Save Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China's alcohol industry is
cutting production of rice liquors and developing more fruit wine
and beer under a plan to reduce grain consumption, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"The industry has to solve the problem of huge grain
consumption to ensure healthy development in the future," said
Wang Lizeng, a division chief with China National Council of
Light Industry.
</P>
<P>
Rice liquor distillers are the major industrial grain
consumers. The distillation of one kilogram of white spirits
requires at least two kilograms of grain.
</P>
<P>
About 14 million tons of grain are consumed every year for
white spirits production, which is expected to reach seven million
tons this year, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The amount of grain is enough to feed 30 million people for a
year - unsuitable for a country that must feed 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
To save grain, Wang said China must limit white spirit output
as well as reduce alcoholic content.

</P>
<P>
North China's Hebei province, despite of serious floods in
summer, reaped even more grain than last year. A harvest of 27.7
billion kilograms of grain was reported, 310 million kilograms of
grain more than last year.

provinces, central China's Hubei province, northeast China's
Liaoning, Jilin provinces, northwest China's Gansu, Shaanxi
provinces, and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The northeastern part of China is known as the country's
granary. Jilin province from the part expects a grain harvest of
23 billion kilograms this year. Two million tons of maize stocks
have been recently shipped from Jilin to south China, in order to
make enough warehouses space for Jilin's new grain harvest.

BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- An anticipated abundant grain
harvest is expected to reflect the success of agricultural
investment from the government, banks, international financial

</P>
<P>
The State's agriculture allocations were 69.4 billion (8.36
billion US dollars) last year, up 11.8 percent from the previous
year.

<P>
In contrast, the State revenue reported a year-on-year growth

The Agriculture Bank of China (ABC) and the Agriculture
Development Bank of China (ADBC) are becoming flagships in the

WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were
killed and four left missing while dozens of others injured when a
grain freighter smashed into a shopping mall in New Orleans today,
local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Charity Hospital officials said at least 77 people were being
treated at four city hospitals as a result of the accident at 2
p.m. (2000 GMT), in which parts of the three-tiered wharf were
demolished.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the captain had sounded the horn about three
minutes before the Liberian-registered freighter, "Bright Field,"
ran out of control and sliced bow-first into the part of the
Riverwalk mall that extends over the river.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of shoppers and tourists were in the Riverwalk shops
near the heart of the city's French Quarter and tourist district.
</P>
<P>
People started running out in panic and jumping into the
Mississippi River and trampling each other in the rush to escape
when they saw the freighter was coming into the window and the
ceiling began falling.
</P>
<P>
A group of Girl Scouts who initially had been reported missing
were found safe, but four disabled children could not be found
hours after the accident, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers searched the rubble with heat-sensing equipment,
trying to find some people that are possibly trapped in the
debris, a Coast Guard said.

<HEADLINE> China's Oil Output to Surpass 150 Million Tons in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China had pumped out 150
million tons of crude oil by Saturday, according to statistics
released by the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC),
China's leading newspaper, "People's Daily", reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the CNPC, the country's total output of crude oil
this year is expected to surpass 155 million tons. That means
China would reach the goal of crude oil production set for the
year 2000 four years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
This is another significant achievement China has made in crude
oil production since 1978 when its crude oil output reached 100
million tons, becoming a major world oil producer.
</P>
<P>
China produced 10 million tons of crude oil in 1965 thanks to
the development of Daqing Oil Field in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
China's crude oil production kept increasing during the past
five years through implementing the policy of stabilizing the
production of eastern oilfields while developing the western
oilfields.
</P>
<P>
Onshore oilfields headed by Daqing produced 80 percent of the
crude oil output this year.
</P>
<P>
Several western oilfields all increased their output this year
and the Karamay Oilfield is expected to pump out more than eight
million tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUOYANG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- An antidote for plant diseases
developed by scientists at China's top science organization has
proved to be the most effective yet for diseases harming cotton,
wheat, rice, fruit trees and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The 990A plant disease-resistant treatment is mainly made of
trace elements and humic acid. It was developed by Jiang Zhengqi,
Xie Qiangjiang, Huang Qiliang and Hou Wuwei of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (CAS) and has been in experimental use for three years
in various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The dosage is not only specially effective for plant diseases
caused by funguses, it can also strengthen the disease-resistance
of plants and improve the effect of photosynthesis.
</P>
<P>
The CAS Animal Research Institute reported that the liquid is
nontoxic.
</P>
<P>
About 30 percent of the cotton fields in China is affected by
blight, which causes losses of over 100,000 tons of ginned cotton
annually.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Chemicals Exports to Grow 17.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Chile's chemical exports will
reach a record high of 700 million dollars this year, an increase
of 17.4 percent from 596 million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The boost in chemicals exports is mainly prompted by new
markets which are supported by bilateral and multilateral trade
agreements with the European Union and Canada, Francisco Munoz,
president of the Chemical Industrialists Association (Asiquim in
Spanish) of Chile, said today.
</P>
<P>
The new markets mean "a unique opportunity for the sector...to
continue a sustained growth of its exports," despite an average
drop of 4.7 percent in the prices of the chemicals exported, said
Munoz.
</P>
<P>
Most of Chile's chemical exports go to Europe, Mercosur (the
South American Common Market, including Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay, and Uruguay, and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The country is expected to produce over 1.5 billion dollars of
chemical products this year, representing a 5-percent rise over
1995, according to Munoz.
</P>
<P>
Asiquim consists of more than 130 companies that produce some
300 chemical substances for the industry.

<HEADLINE> New Democracy Welcomes OSCE Decision to Send </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The New Democracy party in
Yugoslavia today welcomed the positive answer of the European
Union (EU) to send a delegation to Belgrade to find the cause for
the crisis in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
New Democracy is the third party in the leftist coalition which
also comprises of the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia and the
Yugoslav United Left. The leftist coalition won a majority in the
federal parliament elections in early November.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by the official Tanjug news agency, New
Democracy said it welcomed the decision of the EU and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in
reply to an invitation from Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher
Thursday, Milosevic said the Serbian government decided to invite
the OSCE to send a team to look into conflicts over the results of
the local elections.
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition Zajedno has been staging rallies and
demonstrations in Belgrade over the past four weeks to protest the
annulment of the elections results for local authorities, causing
tension between the opposition parties and the government.
</P>
<P>
New Democracy's statement confirmed the option to respect and
implement European standards in the election procedure. It
repeatedly pointed out that the voters' will must be respected and
that no one has the right to change it.
</P>
<P>
The party also believes, however, that demonstrations are not
the right way to resolve conflicts over the results of the local
elections, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"That is why New Democracy welcomes the EU and OSCE stand,
expressing full confidence that the results of the OSCE mission
will disperse many illusions not only of local power-wielders, but
also of part of the opposition. The mission, in addition to
opening dialogue in Serbia, will tell citizens the truth and thus
bring badly needed peace and confidence in institutions," the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Rejects Major's Proposal to Fix National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today rejected a proposal by British Prime Minister John Major
that the bills of the European single currency, euro, be fixed
with national signs of the 15 European Union (EU) countries.
</P>
<P>
"I am not in favor of it. France is a tourist country. This
would mean that, very rapidly, we would have in France, especially
south of the Loire (river), only the bills with the heads of
Sweden, Germany, etc," Chirac was quoted as saying at a press
conference this evening in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
He praised the layouts of the euro bills, presented during the
EU Dublin summit today and Friday, as "very pretty," and choices
of the symbols of Europe they represent as "very good."
</P>
<P>
But he said that German Chancellor Helmut Kohl complained that
the colors of the bills are not vivid enough, which can cause
confusion for people without good eyes.
</P>
<P>
The euro bills will be published in units of five, 10, 20, 50,
100, 200 and 500 euros by 2002.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Boosting of Adoption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Clinton, in
his weekly radio address today, promised to step up efforts to
boost adoption rates.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he wanted "to give even more children what every
child needs and deserves: loving parents and a strong and stable
home."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was calling upon his cabinet to develop
proposals to at least double, by the year 2002, the 27,000
children in foster care who are adopted or permanently placed with
families each year.
</P>
<P>
As part of the initiative, the White House said the federal
government would promise states financial incentives to increase
the number of adoptions from the welfare system, and to identify
and reduce barriers to permanent adoption.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health and Human Services also will
"aggressively implement" laws prohibiting discrimination in
adoption, and clarify the "reasonable effort" rule to help
children immediately find permanent homes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he also was ordering four cabinet agencies --
Treasury, Labor, Commerce and HHS -- to develop campaigns to
promote public awareness of adoption and to honor private sector
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "With this effort we are saying no child should
be trapped in the limbo of foster care, no child should be
uncertain about what the words `family' or `parents' or `home'
mean."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: EU Summit Gives Single Currency Dynamic Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUBLIN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) leaders
ended their two-day summit here this afternoon with significant
progress in making preparations for the European Monetary Union
(EMU) to be launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after the summit, EU Commission
President Jacques Santer described the meeting as "a great
success."
</P>
<P>
"The single currency has become more visible than ever," Santer
said.
</P>
<P>
"All technical preparations are now politically agreed and all
guarantees are now in place to make the Euro one of the strongest
currencies in the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Presidency Conclusions, a final document adopted at the end
of the summit, said that leaders of the bloc's 15 member states
welcome the decisive progress on pushing forward the single
currency in the following fields:
</P>
<P>
-- The structure of the new exchange rate mechanism (ERM2) has
been agreed and a draft resolution setting out the fundamental
elements of the ERM2 will be submitted to the Amsterdam EU summit
in June 1997;
</P>
<P>
-- The urgent aspects of the legal status for the use of Euro
have been finalized for early adoption and other provisions are
virtually completed; and
</P>
<P>
-- The principles and main elements of the Stability and Growth
Pact for ensuring budgetary discipline in the EMU have been
agreed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Irish Prime Minister John Bruton, whose country is
the current EU rotating presidency, told the press conference that
there were still remaining obstacles to be resolved in the process
of introducing the Euro in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Franco-German row over the stability pact is a clear signal
that even the strongest advocates of European integration
sometimes have different views on the single currency, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
A smooth sailing of Euro banknotes into the EU citizens'
pockets is simply impossible, they predicted.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major, whose country is opposed to
further European integration, openly voiced his doubts by saying
"I haven't changed my mind on my doubts that enough European
countries are economically ready to allow a single currency safely
to go ahead."

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Complains About Delays in Budget Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 14 Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin today complained that the State Duma, lower house of
parliament, has delayed in passing of the 1997 draft budget, and
called on the lawmakers to okay the bill.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Public Russian Television tonight,
Chernomyrdin aid that "Sunday is not going to be an easy day,"
referring to the upcoming voting on the 1997 draft budget
scheduled for December 15.
</P>
<P>
"We have never worked on draft budgets as much as we did this
year," he said, noting, however, that the "passage of the 1997
budget is being delayed."
</P>
<P>
The Chernomyrdin-headed government submitted the original draft
budget for next year to the Duma in early November for approval.
But the lower chamber rejected the bill, describing it as
"unrealistic." The cabinet has had to make some changes in the
bill and sent the lower house a note explaining the changes.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said tonight he believes that 1997 will be "a
crucial year, which will finally see a turning point for the
Russian economy."
</P>
<P>
The first step for the government, however, is to get the 1997
budget approved by the Duma.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to increase the gross domestic product (GDP) by 2
percent.... This will reverse the situation in the country anyway.
This is the only way to save (Russians) from lingering sufferings
of the last few years, the Russian premier aid.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, he said, more money will be spent on the
construction of new enterprises and the use of modern
technologies.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the budget, the government will also submit a
medium-term program of up to the year 2000 to the Duma by December
25. The program calls for a 6-7 percent increase in production and
a 4.5 percent increment in GDP.
</P>
<P>
"This would be colossal headway for Russia," Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was appointed prime minister four years ago. In
looking back on the history of his cabinet, he said he is proud of
the government for its past and present efforts. "One thing
doesn't come off, something else isn't quite right, and still we
work conscientiously," he said.
