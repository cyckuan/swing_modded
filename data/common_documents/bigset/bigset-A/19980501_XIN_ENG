<HEADLINE> Computer Sales Stimulate U.S. Strong Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Spurred by domestic computer
sales to offset the impact of the Asian crisis, the U.S. economic
performance recorded robust growth during the first three months
of the year, the Commerce Department reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), the sum of all goods and
services produced within U.S. borders, increased at a rapid
seasonally adjusted 4.2 percent annual rate in the January-March
quarter, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
That was up from a 3.7 percent rate in the final quarter of
1997 and was the fastest pace in a year.
</P>
<P>
Increased computer purchases by both individuals and businesses
were the main motive power for the step-up in first-quarter
economic growth. Excluding it, the economy would have grown at a
3.5 percent pace, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Some economists have predicted a more subdued, but still
healthy, 3.3 percent growth rate for total GDP in the first
quarter. The strong performance could have increased Wall Street
fears that the Federal Reserve was preparing to squelch any
developing inflationary pressures by raising interest rates to
slow economic growth.
</P>
<P>
However, a dramatic improvement in a price index tied to the
GDP and a separate Labor Department report showing easing wage
pressures helped reassure financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The GDP price measure moved up at a 0.9 percent annual rate,
the smallest in nearly 35 years. It had risen at a 1.4 percent
rate in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
According to the Labor Department, the Americans' wages and
benefits rose a moderate 0.7 percent in the quarter. It was the
smallest rise in a year and followed a brisker 1 percent increase
in the October-December quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department also said new claims for unemployment
benefits edged up by 1,000 last week to 319,000, the highest level
since late February and perhaps a hint of economic slowing after
the torrid first quarter.
</P>
<P>
During the period from January to March, the U.S. exports fell
at a 3.4 percent rate, the sharpest drop in about four years. At
the same time, imports shot up at an 11.6 percent pace. The
combination produced the worst deterioration in the U.S. trade
deficit on record for the past half century.
</P>
<P>
However, the low-level long-term U.S. interest rates, caused by
investors shifting funds from Asia to this country, appear to
have more than offset the deterioration in the trade balance.
</P>
<P>
In the quarter, business investment in new equipment shot up at
a 28.8 percent rate, the fastest since late 1983. Investment in
computers alone soared at an 89 percent rate. Spending on housing
jumped at a 17.6 percent rate, the most rapid rate in nearly two
years.
</P>
<P>
Growth in consumer spending more than doubled from a moderate
2.5 percent rate in the fourth quarter to 5.7 percent in the
first, the speediest pace in six years. Expensive items from cars
to computers, often purchased on credit, rose at an 18.4 percent
rate.
</P>
<P>
Besides trade, three other factors affected the growth in the
first quarter, a slowdown in the growth of business inventories, a
decline in business spending on new buildings and a drop in
government spending, at a 2 percent rate. That was largely because
defense spending plummeted at a 16.7 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
These changes left the GDP accumulating at a seasonally
adjusted, but not inflation-adjusted, rate of 8.33 trillion U.S.
dollars in the quarter.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes Important Microsoft Research Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. announced here
today that its research and development body in China, the
Microsoft China R&AMP;D Center, has undergone major expansion, and is
now a significant overseas research base for the world's largest
software provider.
</P>
<P>
The China R&AMP;D Center is located here, and is one of Microsoft's
four software developers worldwide. The other three are in the US
headquarters, Israel and India.
</P>
<P>
Following its role expansion, the Beijing center will focus on the
development and application of Windows CE, a new operating system,
and provide some core technology to the global product portfolio
of Microsoft, said Harel Kodesh, general manager of Microsoft
Consumer Appliances Division.
</P>
<P>
The center will continue to step up the localization of
Microsoft products and conduct research on the Chinese language
environment.
</P>
<P>
Windows CE, as an embedded operating system, is able to support
different chips. It can be applied to business and personal
computer (PC) extensions, and home products. The products include
palm-sized PCs, auto PCs, mobile phones, on-the-spot factory
management systems and stock trading terminals.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Microsoft has built teams both inside
and outside the United States "to build specific products
for a given country," said Kodesh.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft will launch the Chinese version of Windows CE products
within this year, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Sean Zhang, director of the China R&AMP;D Center, said this
organization is not subordinate to Microsoft (China) Co. Ltd., but
reports directly to Microsoft headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The center currently has 70 people, and this figure is expected
to double by the end of 1999.

OTTAWA -- The United States should stop trying to bully Cuban
President Fidel Castro into change, Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said after his return from an official visit to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The decades-old U.S. economic embargo and other pressure
tactics are hurting the Cuban people needlessly, Chretien was
quoted as saying in published reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chretien was particularly concerned that the embargo deprived
Cubans of anesthetics and other medicines.
</P>
<P>
"I am told that dentists do not have the proper anesthesia to
serve the people," he said in an interview with CNN after his
return.
</P>
<P>
This is not the way a rich and powerful country like the United
States should behave toward a smaller neighbor, Chretien said.

MOSCOW -- Russia is opposed to the new economic sanctions the
Contact Group imposed on Yugoslavia, a Russian foreign ministry
spokesman said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Rakhmanin said the six-nation Contact Group should
instead focus attention on promoting political dialogue between
Belgrade and ethnic Albanian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Contact Group, which include the United States,
Russia, France, Britain, Germany and Italy, met in Rome on April
29 to discuss the escalating Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after the meeting, the group, with the exception
of Russia, decided to freeze Yugoslav assets abroad and threatened
to impose harsher sanctions if Belgrade fails to ease tensions in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Only With political dialogue, not economic sanctions, can the
international community dissolve the Kosovo crisis," Rakhmanin
said. (Russia-Contact Group-Kosovo)

<HEADLINE> S'pore Economy Grows by 5.6 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore economy grew by 5.6
percent in the first quarter of this year over a year ago, and the
government is still expecting a 2.5-4.5 percent growth for the
whole year, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an annual May Day dinner Thursday night, Lee
warned, however, that because of the regional economic crisis,
Singapore will have slower growth this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the 5.6-percent growth in the first quarter this year
looked satisfactory. But he quickly added that in reality, growth
momentum has been slowing down since the middle of last year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that growth has fallen for three successive quarters,
from 10.7 percent in the third quarter of 1997 to 7.6 percent in
the fourth quarter of the year and to 5.6 percent in the first
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Even this 5.6 percent is partly statistical, because we are
comparing against the first quarter a year ago, the first quarter
1997, which was a low base. If we compare the first quarter 1998
with the preceding quarter, the fourth quarter 1997, on a
seasonally adjusted and annualized basis, the figure is in fact
slightly negative: -1.4 percent," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Given the situation, Lee warned that Singaporeans would have to
observe wage restraint and expect more retrenchment.
</P>
<P>
However, as for the whole year of 1998, the deputy prime
minister said that the government could not be certain the growth
would not be lower than the 2.5-4.5 percent forecast, if problems
in the region worsened.
</P>
<P>
"But as of now, we do not expect negative growth. I notice that
the IMF (International Monetary Fund) too shares this view, unlike
some private sector analysts," Lee said.

<HEADLINE> European Parliament Approves Euro-Participating Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament approved
on Thursday the European Commission's recommendation for 11
countries to join the single currency mechanism in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
The European legislators voted 402-79 with 27 abstentions to
approve the recommendation made on March 25.
</P>
<P>
The European Council of finance ministers and the European
Union Summit members -- scheduled to meet this weekend -- are the
institutions to give their final approval.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, recommended that Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland,
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland
be the founding countries of the single currency, known as the
euro.
</P>
<P>
The four other EU member states remain outside the first wave
of the single currency launch.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Denmark opted out on their own, while Sweden and
Greece were judged by the commission to be not economically ready
to join.
</P>
<P>
European legislators also advised on Thursday that the weekend
summit must decide on a single candidate to preside over the
future European Central Bank (ECB).
</P>
<P>
They also urged Belgium and Italy to make more efforts to
reduce their high public debts.
</P>
<P>
The European Union suggested that countries aspiring to join
the single currency system should have a debt to gross domestic
product ratio of less than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Belgium and Italy, however, still have 122.2 percent and 121.6
percent respectively of the debt-to-GDP ratio and have been the
center of argument on whether they are fit to be on board.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is backing the bid by the current head of the
European Monetary Institute, Wim Duisenberg, to head the future
ECB, whereas France is championing its own central banker
Jean-Claude Trichet to be the ECB president.

<P>
YICHANG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The temporary shiplock of the
multi-billion-yuan Three Gorges Dam Project has successfully
passed its trial operation and will go into formal operation
tomorrow, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
It took five years to build the shiplock, before it was put
under the management of the Yangtze River Shipping Department
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The shiplock, which stands on the left bank of the river, will
be in use for the next six years, together with a specially built
canal. The shiplock will only be used for shipping when the water
flow exceeds 10,000 cu m, which will occur only in flood
situations, while under normal circumstances the canal will be
used for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
According to the official plan for the project, a permanent
shiplock, the world's largest, will be in operation by the year
2003.

<HEADLINE> Renounce Violence For Good, Blair Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
insisted on Thursday that the parties concerned must renounce
violence before they can govern Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Blair was speaking after the Irish Republican Army (IRA) said
it would not immediately begin to decommission arms.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday, the IRA cleared the way for
members of its political wing, Sinn Fein, to take their seats in
the new Belfast assembly to be set up under the Northern Ireland
Good Friday agreement.
</P>
<P>
But the IRA warned, in a reiteration of its standard line on
weapons, that there will be no decommissioning of IRA arms.
</P>
<P>
However, Blair insisted: "It's got to be clear that people who
serve in the government of Northern Ireland have given up violence
for good."
</P>
<P>
The IRA's statement said the Good Friday document marked a
significant development, but added that the document fell short of
being a solid basis for a lasting settlement and was viewed
against their republican objectives.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 90 percent of the
European Commission's 18,000 employees went on strike Thursday to
protest a commission reform plan that allegedly would affect the
interests and benefits of commission employees.
</P>
<P>
Recruitment and promotion will also be affected by the proposed
reform, according to those on strike.
</P>
<P>
The employees will also receive part of their salaries from
their own countries instead of all from the commission, meaning a
decrease in income, they said.
</P>
<P>
The reform plan was prepared by European Commissioner Erkki
Liikanen who is responsible for budget and personnel
administration.
</P>
<P>
The commission should reconsider the reform plan and set up a
special group of high-ranking officials to assess employees'
demands, said Michael Docherty, an employee.
</P>
<P>
Another protester said that further action is planned if the
commission does not work out proper proposals and resolutions to
resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
The employees could block the operation of the commission
through various means if the commission fails to answer the
request before May 20, Liikanen said.
</P>
<P>
Translators and interpreters, who facilitate the commission's
daily briefings, also went on strike, leaving only two on hand at
the routine mid-day briefing.

<HEADLINE> Christie's HK Spring Auctions Set Record Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Christie's Hong Kong
established several record prices during its spring auction series
 this week, realizing a solid total of 213 million HK dollars
(27.31 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The magnificent jewels and watches sale achieved an outstanding
92.48 million HK dollars (11.86 million U.S. dollars), making it
the largest jewelry sale ever held in Asia. Private buyers from
Asia represented almost 90 percent of the buyers.
</P>
<P>
The largest vivid pink diamond ever to be auctioned, a
3.2-carat ring, established a record price for colored diamonds
sold at auction in Asia when London jeweler Graff bought it for
9.15 million HK dollars, (1.17 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The largest single-owner collection of internally flawless
diamonds ever offered for sale in Asia was 100 percent sold, of
which a necklace, comprising of five pure white internally
flawless diamonds totaling 32.41 carats, sold for 9.98 million HK
dollars (1.28 million U.S. dollars) to an Asian private buyer
after frenzied bidding. It became the most expensive diamond
necklace sold at auction in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The market for jadeite jewelry proved more selective. The two
highest selling lots were a magnificent jadeite necklace of 30
beads and a fine double-strand jadeite necklace which sold for
7.35 million HK dollars (942,308 U.S. dollars) and 3.54 million HK
dollars (453,846 U.S. dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
Also noteworthy was a magnificent "gingko nut' "Chinese retro"
style jadeite ring which obtained 2.99 million HK dollars (383,333
U.S. dollars), a million HK dollars more than its pre-sale
estimate.
</P>
<P>
A very rare black jadeite necklace sold for 1.23 million HK
dollars (157,692 U.S. dollars), three times more than its pre-sale
estimate.
</P>
<P>
The Magnificent Jadeite Jewelry and Jewelry Without Reserve
sales totaled 52.49 million HK dollars (6.73 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the sales, Anthony Lin, deputy chairman for
Christie's Asia, said, "In the context of the current economic
challenges around Asia, we are delighted that our sales achieved
the projected budgets and that we sold a number of the best pieces
for high prices ... particularly in Western jewelry."

<HEADLINE> ADB Should Help Develop Asian Bond Markets: Delegate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
should focus its efforts on developing the Asian bond markets and
be more active in issuing bonds within the region, said a bank
official from Hong Kong, China, here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"If the ADB were to issue bonds to fund Asian financial sector
development to help alleviate the intermediation problem in Asia,
Hong Kong will be one of the first to invest in such bonds," said
Joseph Yam, head of the delegation from Hong Kong, China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a session of the 31st annual meeting, Yam, the
chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said that one
of the major factors leading to the Asian financial crisis was the
short-term liquidity crunch that emerged at the beginning of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Even though the IMF mobilized financing totaling 110 billion
U.S. dollars for three program countries in Asia, with two-thirds
coming from the multilateral financial institutions (IFIs), and
one-third from bilateral financing," Yam said, "it was still
insufficient relative to the markets needs."
</P>
<P>
"Such official liquidity cannot come fast enough and at the
right price to calm the international investors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yam believed that the multilateral development banks (MDBs)
have a role of assisting in the recycling of international
liquidity, for example, by issuing bonds themselves and channel
liquidity or provide guarantee or credit enhancement on bonds
issued by the adjusting economies.
</P>
<P>
"This could help to develop a deep and mature Asian bond
market, and encourage Asian economies to invest their official
reserves in the region," Yam said.
</P>
<P>
"Another dimension to develop Asian bond markets is for the
IFIs to issue bonds in Asia to act as the catalyst for the nascent
Asian bond markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yam told the session that Asia has the highest saving rate and
more than half of the world's reserves belong to Asian economies,
saying, "There is tremendous appetite for high quality fixed
income instruments from Asian investors and central banks and
monetary authorities."
</P>
<P>
He urged the ADB, the only development bank in Asia which is
majority-owned by the Asian and Pacific economies and was founded
with the objective of promoting and developing the economies and
markets in the region, to "focus its efforts on developing the

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Ends Dalian's Unbeaten Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A goal from Yao Xia lifted
Sichuan Quanxin 1-0 over Dalian Wanda at home on Thursday, ending
the defending champion's eight-game unbeaten streak.
</P>
<P>
The Dalian goalkeeper parried a shot from Sichuan striker Li
Bin from within the penalty area in the 40th minute.
</P>
<P>
But the ball just landed in the path of Yao to score, giving
Quanxin its first ever win over Dalian since the professional
league started in 1994.
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 home fans immediately went into ecstacy at the
stadium in Chengdu, capital of southwestern Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
Dalian's best chance came in the second half, when a long-range
blast from its Czech player Vaclav Nemecek hit the bar.
</P>
<P>
For Dalian, it was just another blow to the team's morale since
its historic 55-game unbeaten streak in the league was stopped by
Shanghai Shenhua in the final match last season.
</P>
<P>
Shenhua looked its form rebounding when it scored second
consecutive victory after drubbing visiting Shenzhen Pingan 4-0.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai led the first half 1-0 through Shen Si, who scored in
the 10th minute on a Fan Zhiyi pass from right.
</P>
<P>
The host continued to dominate the second half, starting a
scoring spree in the last 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Qi Hong netted in the 60th minute, Chinese national defender Wu
Chenying added the third in 68th before Paraguyan Sando Valg Elvio
sealed the victory in the 73rd minute.
</P>
<P>
Shenhua moved to second place behind Dalian in the standings
with 15 points, while Sichuan, which collected the same point, was
third with inferior goal difference.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Guo'an dropped to fourth from third place when they
drew goalless with Wuhan Yaqi in Wuhan, central Hubei province.
</P>
<P>
In Shenyang, northeastern Liaoning province, Shenyang Haishi
defeated Guangzhou Songri on a controversial penalty.
</P>
<P>
The host was awarded the penalty, converted by Piao Junjie,
after Xie Yuxin, dribbling a ball, was fell by a Songri defender
in the area.
</P>
<P>
A sudden downpour after the break doused the hope of host
Guangzhou Apollo to recover from a 1-2 halftime deficit before
losing to Shandong Luneng 1-3 in Guangzhou, southern Guangdong
province.
</P>
<P>
In Shijiazhuang, northern Hebei province, Yanbian Aodong
struggled out of shadow of recent losses to beat Chinese Army 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Yanbian, whose South Korean coach resigned Sunday for past poor
results, led the first half 1-0 and won on a late penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
In Chongqin, Sichuan province, Vanguards Huandao trashed
Qingdao Hainiu 4-0 after leading 1-0 before the break.

<HEADLINE> Germany Hails Good Ties With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
Thursday spoke highly of the good relations between Germany and
Israel, stressing that maintaining such relations is a central
element of the German foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on the 50th anniversary of the founding of
Israel, Kinkel said, "Despite the heavy burden of the Holocaust,
the relations between Germany and Israel in the past 50 years have
developed in a very positive way, which we could not have expected
and for which we are thankful."
</P>
<P>
"Germany is now Israel's most important partner in the world
after the United States," Kinkel added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Germany saw itself have special responsibility to
ensure that the Israeli people can live in peace and be free from
fears and threat within secure borders. Therefore, he said,
Germany supported the process towards "a peaceful balance" between
different peoples in the Middle East region and especially between
Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
However, Kinkel stressed that in order to break the current
deadlock in the Middle East peace process, it would require
"painful decisions and compromises" from both sides.

<HEADLINE> Harsh Times facing Zimbabwean Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- There is growing apprehension
among Zimbabwe's labour force as many face the axe because of
increased company closures and retrenchments, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that during the first phase of economic
reforms running from 1991 to 1996, companies reeling under severe
viability problems downsized by more than 50,000.
</P>
<P>
During that period the government cut the number of civil
servants by 23,500, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But this is insignificant when compared with the actual
retrenchments on the job market.
</P>
<P>
The Employers Confederation of Zimbabwe (EMCOZ) said Thursday
that many companies are retrenching without reporting to the
retrenchment committee under the ministry of public service,
labour and social welfare.
</P>
<P>
EMCOZ said that "the picture on the labour market is not very
good this year and the economic performance and some other
factors will impact on the retrenchments we will see this year.
The retrenchments are going to go on and in fact they will be
worse."
</P>
<P>
Of Zimbabwe's 12.5 million people, less than one million are
in formal employment and two million are self-employed while more
than two million others are unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions said that its membership
has gone down from 1.5 million at the beginning of 1992 to the
current estimated figure of less than one million.
</P>
<P>
Employment growth is estimated at 0.67 percent per year and
yet population is growing at the rate of 3.2 percent which means
that job creation is lagging far behind, the report said.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial On May 1 Labor Day (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Tomorrow "People's Daily"
editorial calls on the Chinese working class to rally still more
closely around the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
Party and advance China's on-going reform on the occasion of the
International Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, titled "Shouldering the Sacred Historic
Mission," urges the working class to participate in the building
of socialism with Chinese characteristics, which "represents the
fundamental interests of the working class".
</P>
<P>
China's working class has always stood in the forefront,
either during the years of revolutionary wars, or in the wave of
building socialism, or in the new period of the current reform,
opening and modernization, the paper recalls.
</P>
<P>
"The reform, the main theme in China today, has entered a
crucial stage," the editorial says, "while the restructuring of
state-owned enterprises, the pillar of the national economy, is
the focal point of the economic restructuring."
</P>
<P>
One of the most important ways to achieve the goals of state
enterprise restructuring is to, as has always been the case, rely
on the working class whole-heartedly, ensuring its status as the
masters of the country, and bringing its role as the main force
into play, the editorial says.

<P>
In socialist China, it stresses, no major accomplishments are
possible without the support of the working class. It must be made
clear that in the efforts to deepen the reform the working class
is the bulk and driving force, not the target and blocking force,
it stresses.
</P>
<P>
The working class, master of both the country and the
enterprise, is the fundamental guarantee for the long-term
interests of the nation and the people, it says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial underlines the importance of tackling the issues
related to laid-offs' living and re-employment, as "this not only
hinges on the destiny of the restructuring of state enterprises
but is also related to the country's economic development and
social stability."
</P>
<P>
It calls on local governments at all levels to understand the
issue of laid-off workers correctly, with profound feeling, and
in a highly responsible manner.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the editorial says, in 1998 the Chinese government
plans to achieve an eight percent economic growth, three percent
inflation and a stable value of the Renminbi, the Chinese
currency. At the same time, China is resolved to make an overall
advance in its drive to restructure state enterprises, the
financial sector and government institutions, as well as to
promote cultural and ethnic progress, and build democracy and the
rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The working people should take a long-term point of view, give
scope to their role as the masters of the country and involve
themselves in their effort to achieve the nation's goals, the
editorial concludes.

<HEADLINE> Indian Finance Minister Calls for Global Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial crisis is not
a crisis of Asia, but one of the global financial structure, said
India's Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 31st annual meeting of the Asian Development
Bank (ADB), Sinha said that the cause of the crisis is a lack of
financial discipline in the international financial system.
</P>
<P>
He said that this crisis could have started anywhere, and it
just happened to start in Asia, therefore it is no point putting
all the blame on Asian countries affected.
</P>
<P>
The world should recognize that though the crisis erupted in
Asia, Sinha said, it is in fact a symptom of a weakness inherent
in the international financial system.
</P>
<P>
He said there is growing need to enhance the ADB's technical
capabilities to analyze and make constructive suggestions to the
developing member countries (DMCs) on issues relating to
strengthening of their financial sectors.
</P>
<P>
"A strong policy environment and regulatory system will help
create conditions conducive to a stable and efficient capital flow
in the DMCs," said Sinha.
</P>
<P>
"Multilateral financial institutions like the ADB need to
strengthen their capacities to analyze situations well in advance
and to provide warning signals as well as to prescribe remedial
actions," he said. "This will help prevent future crisis from
damaging the development process."
</P>
<P>
The Indian finance minister warned, "If we fail to evolve an
international consensus, then the only option is unilateral
national action which serves nobody's case."

<HEADLINE> UK Royal Family to Open Up Accounts for Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain's House of Commons
announced Thursday that the National Audit Office (NAO) was given
the right to inspect key accounts of the royal family to make
royal spending of public money more transparent.
</P>
<P>
David Davis, chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee,
said in a statement that the move would allow the NAO to examine
how 20 million pounds (33.4 million U.S. dollars) a year of
taxpayers' money is spent on royal residences such as Buckingham
Palace and Windsor Castle.
</P>
<P>
The NAO will also look at transport arrangements for the queen
and her family on official engagements, said Davis.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 35 million pounds (58.5 million dollars)
of public money is spent every year on the royal family's palaces
and travel arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The NAO has had to ask for permission to check those accounts.
Now the watchdog is to be allowed direct access.
</P>
<P>
"The new arrangements will enable the NAO to look at the
spending in detail and report matters of concern to parliament,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"These arrangements represent a marked improvement in the
transparency of spending of taxpayers' money in support of the
royal family."
</P>
<P>
This is another step the government and the royal family took
to reform to make the royal family more open to public scrutiny
and will lead to greater public confidence in it.

<HEADLINE> Settlers, Peace Advocates Demonstrate at Har Homa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- About 10,000 Jewish settlers
and their supporters demonstrated at Har Homa near Jerusalem on
Thursday, asking the government to speed up housing construction
there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 500 members of the Israeli "Peace Now" group
and the opposition Meretz party also held a rally at the site,
protesting the government's policy of settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of Israeli troops were deployed to prevent the
settlers from running into conflict with the peace protesters.
</P>
<P>
The settlers laid a foundation stone at the site, vowing that
they will bring down the government of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu if the housing construction was not carried out soon.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration coincided with the Israeli celebrations of
the 50th anniversary as a state and may be indicative how far away
a true and comprehensive peace between Israelis and Palestinians
is going to be.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks stalled March last year due
to Israel's insistence of building housing units for settlers at
the disputed Har Homa, a small hill located between Jerusalem and
Bethlehem. The Palestinians regarded the Israeli move as an
attempt to disrupt their connections with East Arab Jerusalem,
where they want as capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
While the settlers demonstrated rather unexpectedly, the
celebrations for Israel's 50th birthday were gathering steam
across the country well on schedule.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, President Ezer Weizman called over 100
officers and soldiers of the Israel Defense Force to his residence
here and honored their outstanding achievements in different
fields.
</P>
<P>
Israel Air Force exhibited fighting prowess in Tel Aviv
Thursday morning by flying display all kinds of jet fighters and
helicopters in its fleets.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people gathered at Givat Ram Stadium here
Thursday evening for the "Jubilee Bell" gala event, with Weizman,
Netanyahu and U.S. Vice President Al Gore attending.
</P>
<P>
Gore, as the government's special guest of honor to the
celebrations, arrived here Thursday morning. His another important
mission is to try to help bring the long-stalled peace talks back
on track.
</P>
<P>
He will hold talks with Netanyahu Friday morning and meet
Yasser Arafat, president of the Palestinian National Authority, in
Ramallah, the West Bank on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Arafat agreed to attend the London meetings on
May 4 to talk separately with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright. But their big differences on many issues, including the
Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank, seemed hard to
be overcome soon.

<P>
CAIRO, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said on Thursday that the coming days would witness important
developments in the Middle East as the United States launches its
initiative to save the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the nation to mark the International Labor Day
on May 1, Mubarak voiced hope that the U.S. initiative would be
endorsed at the London meetings next Monday to be attended by
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Accepting the U.S. initiative would help strike a balance
between the interests and demands of the two sides, Mubarak said.
He urged Israel to deal with the Palestinians as honest partners
on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader called on the international community,
especially the European Union (EU), to continue their efforts to
help advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt is maintaining contacts with the U,S., the
EU and its member states, and other friendly countries, foremost
Arab countries, to safeguard an unified Arab stance in the face of
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Addressing audience in the Cairo International Conference
Center, Mubarak started his speech by paying tribute to Egypt's
laborers, who he said are the driving force behind the country's
economic reform.

<HEADLINE> Bundesbank Opposes Splitting Term of 1st EU Central </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Hans Tietmeyer, president of
Germany's powerful central bank Bundesbank, Thursday gave a clear
rejection to a possible compromise to split the eight-year term of
the first European central bank (ECB) president in order to end a
EU dispute over the post.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a Bundesbank council meeting in Frankfurt,
Tietmeyer called on European Union leaders to resolve the current
ECB leadership dispute in line with the Maastricht Treaty which
calls for a non-renewable eight-year term for the ECB president to
ensure continuity as well as independence of the bank's policy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tietmeyer expressed his objection to a delay in the
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
Tietmeyer's remarks came on the eve of a EU summit meeting in
Brussels in the following two days which is due to formally select
11 EU states to launch the single European currency euro in
January next year and also to make a decision on who will head the
new central bank.
</P>
<P>
Separately, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Thursday told a
German savings bank conference that "a reasonable and clever
decision" on the ECB leadership issue will be made on May 2 at the
EU summit.
</P>
<P>
The top EU monetary post is currently contested between two
candidates. While Germany and most other EU nations support the
former Dutch central bank chief, Wim Duisenberg, to take the job,
France has insisted on its own nomination of its central bank
governor Jean-Claude Trichet.
</P>
<P>
As a possible compromise, it has been speculated that the
eight-year term of the first ECB president might be split in half
with Duisenberg, 63, serving for the first four years and then
giving up the post to Trichet, 55, for the second half of the
term.
</P>
<P>
Many observers see the current dispute largely as a
confrontation between the two largest EU economies, Germany and
France, over who will hold control over future EU monetary policy.

<HEADLINE> Sudan, Egypt Differ Over Timing of Returning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister
Mustafa Osman Ismail said Khartoum and Cairo differed over the
timing of returning Egyptian properties confiscated by Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said Khartoum was committed to handing back all the
Egyptian properties, "but we differ over the timing".
</P>
<P>
He denied the reports that the 10-day Sudanese-Egyptian talks
on returning the properties, which ended Sunday, had failed,
saying technical talks were going on.
</P>
<P>
An official source said that Egypt insisted on taking over the
properties soon while the Sudanese side had difficulty in
returning most of the buildings immediately because they were
being used.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian properties, which include 120 guest houses,
university buildings and 11 schools, were confiscated by Sudan
after Cairo accused Khartoum in 1992 of harboring Islamic
militants fighting to topple the secular government and to install
a strict religious rule in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
In March 1998, Sudan's President Lt. Gen. Omar el-Bashir
announced Sudan would return to Egypt all the buildings in Sudan.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mandela Praises Luanda's Efforts for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South African President
Nelson Mandela praised the Angolan government for its efforts for
peace in the war-ravaged country here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has made "huge and effective" effort
toward peace, demonstrating its determination to implement the
Lusaka Peace Protocol reached by the two warring sides in 1994,
President Mandela said at the joint press conference after his
talks with Angolan President Jose Dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
The South African president, who ended his two-day state visit
to Angola Thursday, expressed his hope that the opposition
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) would
also make positive efforts.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela hoped that UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi could
come to Luanda as soon as possible, saying problems might occur
if Savimbi did not come to Luanda. He considered that the
preparations made by the Angolan government for the arrival of
Savimbi's 400 bodyguards has been quite satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Mandela reiterated that the South African government will
continue providing support for the Angolan peace process, saying
that peace is helpful "not only for Angola, but also for
strengthening cooperations in southern Africa as well as for the
stability of the whole region."
</P>
<P>
The president said that South Africa will use its modern
technology to boost the economic development in southern Africa
and try its best to change the status of its surplus trade with
Angola so that it will benefit both nations.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela said he was happy that South African
companies have been allowed to participate in the rehabilitation
of roads in central Angola.
</P>
<P>
A South Africa without apartheid and an Angola in peace will
enhance cooperation in various areas, said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
It is Mandela's first state visit to Angola which aimed to
push the Angolan peace process and enhance cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
After arriving here Wednesday at the invitation of Dos Santos,
Mandela addressed the Angolan National Assembly and attended a
workshop on investment arranged for entrepreneurs from the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, South Africa and Angola signed a general
agreement guiding the bilateral cooperation in the future.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Africans to Carry out Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan Thursday urged Africans to carry out political
and economic reform to fully participate in global economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an inaugural ceremony for the newly constructed
U.N. Conference Center here, Annan said, "the challenges that
confront Africa today are neither new and nor easy," adding, "but
we have a duty to face them together."
</P>
<P>
Annan pointed out that "to produce sustained economic growth,
African countries must create and maintain an enabling
environment for investment, an environment that frees up the
creative and entrepreneurial energies of individuals and
societies."
</P>
<P>
"The world economic system is highly competitive and
market-based," Annan said, stressing that "if Africa is to
participate fully in the global economy, political and economic
reform must be carried out."
</P>
<P>
Annan described the newly constructed U.N. Conference Center
as "a symbol of the U.N.'s enduring commitment to Africa," saying
that the center "is a tool in the mission of the Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) to enhance its relevance in the
continent by convening action-oriented conferences and outreach
activities."
</P>
<P>
Speaking also at the inaugural ceremony, Ethiopian President
Negasso Gidada reiterated his country's continued support to the
ECA.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Ethiopia will do its best to work in partnership
with the ECA in its effort to promote the effective use of this
new and ultra-modern conference facility."
</P>
<P>
Annan and Negasso then inaugurated the center which was built
at a cost of 110 million U.S. Dollars with hardware estimated at
100 million Dollars at its completion.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief arrived here Wednesday evening to start his
12-day tour of eight east and central African countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- South African Druggists
(SAD) said here Thursday that it would establish a pharmaceutical
development and manufacturing facility in Maryland, the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The new company, Capricorn Pharma Inc, had already been
incorporated in Maryland, SAD said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The drug organization said that the investment represented a
significant step in the internationalization of SAD's business
and followed the acquisition of Lagap Pharmaceuticals in Britain
and Pharmatic International in Italy.
</P>
<P>
The Maryland facility, which was expected to be operational in
early 1999, would develop and manufacture a selected range of
generic and proprietary oral dosage form products for the
American market.
</P>
<P>
Capricorn would also serve as a base for the SAD group's U.S.
commercial operations, SAD sources said.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Forces Still Remain in Congo (B) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Jose Dos Santos
said here Thursday that Angola still has some of its soldiers in
the Republic of Congo at the latter's request.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with the visiting South
African Presidnet Nelson Mandela, Santos said that Angolan forces
undertook military intervention in Congo (B) under the following
two circumstances: when Angola's interests are threatened, and
when his country receives invitation from Congo (B).
</P>
<P>
He said that most of the troops sent to Congo (B) have
returned home, with some still staying there at the request of
Congo (B) government.
</P>
<P>
The remaining soldiers, he said, would be withdrawn when the
building of the armed forces of Congo (B) is completed, as agreed
by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Angola, Santos said, there is no
indication of further war in the country, adding that peace is
dominating the situation in the country and the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
However, peace is still facing threat in some areas of the
country where incidents have endangered people's life and
property, despite the "turn for the better" in the past few
months.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government and the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) have been making great
effort in accomplishing all the unfinished tasks outlined in the
new timetable adopted on March 6 for implementing the Lusaka
Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Mandela arrived in Luanda Wednesday for a two-day state visit.

<HEADLINE> NATO Concerned by Deteriorating Situation in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- NATO uttered Thursday its
concern with the deteriorating situation in Kosovo and condemned
the increased violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Council, the decision-making body of the
16-nation military alliance, stated that NATO is "profoundly
concerned by the further deterioration of the situation in Kosovo
with the risk of escalating conflict in the region."
</P>
<P>
The council also condemned the excessive use of force by the
Yugoslav army and the proliferation of arms into the territory.
</P>
<P>
But the council made it clear that it is firmly opposed to
independence for Kosovo and to a continuation of the unacceptable
status quo.
</P>
<P>
NATO rejects, the council said, all use of violence, either by
state security forces to suppress political dissent or by
terrorist groups to seek political change.
</P>
<P>
The council called on political leaders in the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia and neighboring countries to exercise the maximum
restraint, prevent the introduction of arms and of armed groups
and condemn terrorism.
</P>
<P>
NATO also called on the Belgrade authorities and the leadership
of the Kosovo-Albanian community to take all possible steps to
prevent further outbreaks of violence and to begin urgently and
without preconditions the process of dialogue necessary to resolve
the differences between them on the basis of the United Nations
Security Council resolution.

<HEADLINE> Malawi to Close Three Embassies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Malawian official
announced Thursday that Lilongwe has decideed to close three of
its embassies in Africa, Asia and Europe to cut expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Zambia News Agency (ZANA) quoted Foreign Affairs Secretary
Ziddy Medi as saying in Lilongwe that the Malawian government has
decided to close the country's embassies in Kenya, Japan and
France due to the high cost of maintaining them.
</P>
<P>
While declining to give figures of the costs in maintaining
these embassies, Medi said that they are "substantial."
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the cost of running the Tokyo embassy
equals that of running two embassies elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
He added that Malawi does not have trained career diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Malawi's diplomatic missions, though thinly staffed, have come
under attack lately because they are run by kith and kin of
politicians, friends and other relatives masquerading as foreign
service workers, said ZANA.
</P>
<P>
France closed its mission in Malawi in 1997, while Kenya and
Japan use diplomats accredited elsewhere in southern Africa to
conduct diplomatic business with Lilongwe.

<HEADLINE> Germany Wants to Improve Ties With Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Germany said Thursday it wants to
improve its relations with Libya and wants to see the country
being included in the dialogue between the European Union and the
Mediterranean nations.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by German Deputy Foreign Minister Helmut
Schaefer during his talks in Bonn with a delegation of the Libyan
parliament led by its Vice-President Abdel Hamid Al-Said
Az-Zentani, a statement of the German Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Schaefer, however, regretted that a dialogue with Libya was not
possible at present yet due to difficulties resulting from the
so-called Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992
for its refusal to extradite two men linked to the 1988 bombing of
a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270
people.
</P>
<P>
Schaefer Thursday called on Libya to meet the U.N. demands.

According to official data, Libya was Germany's fourth largest
crude oil supplier last year after Russia, Norway and Britain.

<HEADLINE> EAC Members Approve Draft Treaty to Upgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Three member states of the
East African Cooperation (EAC) approved a draft treaty Thursday
in a move to upgrade their cooperation into a treaty level,
sources from the EAC Secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
The draft is open to public review for three months before the
Attorneys General of the three countries prepare it for
ratification, the current Chairman of the Tripartite Commission
Jakaya Kikwete said at the close of the Commission's one-day
meeting in Tanzania's northern city of Arusha where the EAC
Secretariat is located.
</P>
<P>
The treaty will help define in clearer terms the shape and
inclination of cooperation in specific areas of the three member
states, namely Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, aiming at establishing
a single market and investment area in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said that the meeting, which was attended by a record
18 ministers and 26 permanent secretaries from the EAC member
states, recommended for setting up a committee to control the
widely-spreading water hyacinth in Lake Victoria which borders
the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete, who is also Tanzanian Minister for Foreign Affairs
and International Cooperation, said hyacinth is posing serious
danger in the lake.
</P>
<P>
He added that "it may eat up the fish and lake if appropriate
measures are not taken."
</P>
<P>
Ministers at the meeting also signed three agreements of road
and inland waterway transport and a memorandum of understanding
on cooperation in defense.
</P>
<P>
Other issues discussed at the meeting were promotion of
inter-state trade, finalization of energy master plan and
preparations for the forthcoming donors conference on EAC road
network to be held on June 25 and 26.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the commission, the highest EAC decision making
body, also approved the audited accounts of the EAC Secretariat
for the fiscal year ending in June 1997 and the budget for
1998/99 fiscal year of a total amount of 2.23 million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The EAC was founded on the basis of the defunct East African
Community which collapsed in 1977 due to reasons including the
divergence of economic policies then pursued by the member
states, the continued perception of disproportionate sharing of
benefits and lack of adequate compensation mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Since its foundation, the EAC has tried to address the
shortcomings inherent in the past cooperation initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Hopes Envoy's Visit Revives Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government hoped the
coming visit by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke will help restart
peace negotiations between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Christos Stylianides said Thursday that
Cyprus government hoped Holbrooke's visit, starting Friday, would
lead to the resumption of the U.N.-sponsored negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman did not give details about the scheduled
visit, saying "the government has nothing to add or to subtract
from its well-known views on attempts to resume the talks and on
the solution we are seeking."
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke's coming visit will be his second to the island in a
month. He failed in his last attempt to get the two sides back to
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash walked out of peace
negotiations last Summer to protest against a European Union
decision to start accession talks with the Cyprus government.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey invaded the
island in 1974 after an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has said that he will not return to peace talks unless
his breakaway republic in northern Cyprus is recognized and the
peace talks are conducted between "two states."
</P>
<P>
The government in the Greek Cypriot south is now recognized
internationally while the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,"
declared unilaterally in 1983, is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriots, however, insisted that peace negotiations
should continue between two communities on the basis of the
U.N. formula for a bicommunal, bizonal federation on the unified
Mediterranean island.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Defends Buying Missiles from Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government reiterated
Thursday that the decision to buy surface-to-air missiles is a
correct move that serves the island's overall strategic objectives.
</P>
<P>
"The order of the missiles is a correct political move, which
was part of our strategic goals and the joint Greco-Cypriot
strategy," government spokesman Christos Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
The comments were in response to recent statements by White
House spokesman Mike McCurry of the United States that deployment
of missiles in Cyprus would destabilize regional situation.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has the responsibility to secure the
country's defense and security, Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal last year to buy Russian-made S-300
missiles, which are scheduled to be delivered later this year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to launch a preemptive strike to prevent
the deployment of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
However, Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides has
hinted recently that the Cypriot government might cancel the
missile deal if the Turkish Cypriots return to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace process came to a standstill last summer when
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash walked out of the
U.N.-sponsored peace talks with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
to protest a European Union decision to start accession talks with
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
troops and took over the northern third after a failed pro-Athens
coup by Greek Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Women's Ingenuity Saves Africa Many Times: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-
General Kofi Annan said here Thursday that the ingenuity of women
has saved Africa many times over and their inspiration will help
Africa's renaissance bear fruit for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address at the ongoing International Conference
on Africa Women and Economic Development, Annan pointed out that
"the challenge today is to ensure that the wisdom, the energies,
and the creativity of women are fully harnessed for the benefit
of all, in other words, that women are involved at every stage,
at every level and at all times, in the process of building the
new Africa."
</P>
<P>
He told 800 participants that gender equality "is a
precondition for meeting the challenge of reducing poverty,
promoting sustainable development and building good governance."
</P>
<P>
He recalled his recent report to the U.N. Security Council and
said there are "30 armed conflicts in Africa over the past
decade. In 1996 alone, 14 countries in Africa were affected.
Those conflicts accounted for more than half the world's
war-related deaths."
</P>
<P>
"Let us put behind us the violence, the conflict, and the
discrimination against women which have often disfigured our
society. Let us move forward to a new era of peace and
prosperity in which African women play a full and equal role," he
urged.
</P>
<P>
He also called to enhance the social, economic and political

<HEADLINE> France to Expand Economic Cooperation with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- France, which is carrying out a
new Africa policy for a bigger market share in the continent, has
seen room for increased economic cooperation with Nigeria, known
as the largest market in west Africa.
</P>
<P>
The priority for the expanded cooperation especially lies in
oil, food processing and agricultural sectors, said French
Ambassador to Nigeria Phillippe Peltier, quoted by the News
Agency of Nigeria Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the envoy, French investment in Nigeria is bigger
than all French investments in Francophone African countries.
</P>
<P>
Peltier did not give the figure of the investment but said
that after the United States, France ranked the second in volume
of foreign investment in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
While the U.S. and Britain are condemning the poor human
rights record of Nigeria, particularly threatening the west
African country with further sanctions, the envoy said relations
between Nigeria and France are cordial.
</P>
<P>
Although government-to-government relations are close, "we
need to know ourselves better," he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the efforts by Nigerians to learn the French
language are positive indications for increased understanding and
improved people-to-people contacts.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha has ordered earlier
that French be made the second official language of the country
after English.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in line with the fact that Nigeria is
surrounded by French-speaking neighbors and the language barrier
should be removed to boost exchanges.
</P>
<P>
In a move to sue for Nigerian media's cooperation for a
successful 1998 World Cup, the French ambassador said the
participation by the Nigerian football team would further boost
relations between the French and Nigerians.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye said Thursday that his country is committed to
cooperate with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said this at the opening ceremony of the
Inflight Catering Services Limited (ICSL) company in Dar es
Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He said the launching of the ICSL is testimony to Tanzania's
commitment to co-operate with investors in order to attain its
economic and social service goals.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the ceremony at ICSL's office in Dar es Salaam
International Airport, Sumaye said that the 100 local staff
employed by the company are lucky to have the opportunity to
learn new technology in the food industry.
</P>
<P>
"Your employment here will be meaningful only when you work
hard and learn every aspect of the industry so that in the future
you can run the company by yourselves," he said, urging the local
staff to maintain sound services.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reaffirmed the government's determination
to forge a strategic partnership with the private sector, saying
investments like ICSL has created jobs, introduced technologies
and will contribute revenue to the government.
</P>
<P>
"I hope many other French companies will join you and make
investments in our country," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He praised the Accor and Proparco Global Companies, the major
shareholders of the ICSL, for investing in the country. Other
partners in the 3.5 million US dollars project are Air Tanzania
Corporation and Taninvest.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Up on Strong Wall Street Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe made
solid gains and ended sharply higher Thursday, supported by a
strong rally on Wall Street in the wake of the release of a set of
benign U.S. economic figures.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE-100 index of leading shares extended Wednesday's
gains and closed up 95.2 points or 1.63 percent at 5,928.3, lifted
by a strong rise of the Dow following the release of a set of U.S.
economic data which eased investors' concern about an imminent
U.S. interest rate hike.
</P>
<P>
Drug shares made good progress on consolidation hopes and music
group EMI climbed 19 percent in value after receiving a bid
approach from an unnamed party.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index on the Frankfurt market, which ends before
Wall Street opens, closed the session down 1.04 points or 0.02
percent at 5,107.44.
</P>
<P>
But in later screen-based trading, the Xetra DAX index ended
157.43 points or 3.10 percent higher at 5,241.23, also boosted by
U.S. first quarter employment cost and GDP growth data which
suggested that U.S. rates would not rise in the near term.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, French shares closed up 146.99 points or
3.94 percent at 3,880.92 as concerns over higher U.S. interest
rates, which rocked French shares at the start of the week, faded
with the release of a subdued U.S. employment cost data.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Encouraged by Iraqi Cooperation on Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said on
Thursday that he was encouraged by Iraq's cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspections and waiting for the Pentagon to recommend a
reduction in U.S. forces in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraged by the level of compliance so far with the
U.N. inspections and by the evidence that has been adduced on the
nuclear side that more progress has been made," Clinton said at a
White House news conference.
</P>
<P>
If Iraq could continue to work with the U.N. weapons
inspectors, "the U.N. may well be able to certify that they are
actually in compliance on the nuclear side and they can go from
the inspection to the monitoring phase" by October, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reaffirmed the U.S. position on sanctions that imposed
on Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War, saying the United States would
vote to lift the sanctions only when "the U.N. resolutions have to
be complied with completely."
</P>
<P>
With regard to reduction of U.S. military presence in the Gulf,
Clinton said he was waiting for a recommendation from the Pentagon
with involvement from the State Department and the National
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"Inevitably, unless we believe there is some reason for it to
be there, at some point in the future I would anticipate some
reallocation of our resources. But I have not received a
recommendation on that yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman Ben Bacon said the
president, with advice from Defense Secretary William Cohen, will
decide whether to reduce a costly force of two aircraft carriers,
more than 300 warplanes and 38,000 personnel deployed in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The gulf force is costing the Pentagon millions of dollars
daily and a decision must be made soon on the dual presence of the
carriers Independence and John Stennis in the Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Probe "Distracting" but Promises to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Referring to controversy from
Monica Lewinsky to Whitewater, U.S. President Bill Clinton said
Thursday that these things are "distracting" but promised to work
with Republicans who stepped up criticism of his character in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
Reponding to an question at his first formal news conference
this year, Clinton said he would not order Attorney General Janet
Reno to fire the Whitewater prosecutor, Kenneth Starr. "That would
not be the appropriate thing for me to do," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Newt Gingrich of the House of Representatives, in
criticizing Clinton in recent days, said Clinton should either
fire Starr or order his aides to stop attacking the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing that he says about me personally will keep me from
working with him," the president said. Clinton reiterated he will
keep doing the peoples' business.
</P>
<P>
On other issues, Clinton said he decided against seeking
federal money for needle exchange programs to keep drug addicts
from getting AIDS because the benefits are uncertain and he didn't
want to imply that "somehow the government in empowering drug
use."
</P>
<P>
He addressed a number of issues facing Congress, including a
tobacco settlement. He urged Congress and others involved in the
debate over anti-tobacco legislation to settle the matter before
the November congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
"If it is an issue in the November election it will only be
because those people who have a political or financial interest in
seeing that this matter is not resolved between now and November
prevent it from being resolved.
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing in the world would be to play politics with
our children's health," he added. "I'm not going to do it, and I
hope no one else will, either."
</P>
<P>
In response to a question whether Starr's inquiry had "gone
beyond the call," Clinton said, "I think modestly observant people
are fully capable of drawing their own conclusions."
</P>
<P>
He said the Secret Service and Treasury Department decided on
their own to shield agents from grand jury testimony. Clinton
noted that former President George Bush has backed the assertion.
</P>
<P>
And on his claim of executive privilege, which is keeping
testimony of White House staff from the grand jury, Clinton said
his lawyers have asked the courts to make their arguments public
"so that you and the American public could evaluate the special
executive privilege issues and whether you believe they're valid
or not."

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Warns Greece Over Hostility Towards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz Thursday called on Greece to give up its hostile attitude
towards Turkey, warning that such a stance will impede
normalization of the Turkish-Greek ties.
</P>
<P>
"It is our right as a neighbor...to warn it (Greece) to stay
away from the heavy responsibilities of possible grave
consequences," Yilmaz said in a written statement faxed to Xinhua
by the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz accused Greece of adopting a series of policies to
undermine Turkey's development and its integration with the
Western world, especially the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Greece, which is a EU member state, has been blocking Turkey
from entering the European organization for its poor human rights
record.
</P>
<P>
As for Turkey' earlier peace call to Greece, Yilmaz said that
Greek government rejected this good-will proposal in an
irresponsible manner.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Turkey is willing to have friendly relations
with Greece, the Turkish prime minister said none of the current
problems were unresolvable.
</P>
<P>
"We once again invite Greece to peace and cooperation between
our two countries," Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem proposed in February
bilateral discussions on the Aegean issues but was turned down by
Greece.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Yilmaz also denounced the alleged Greek
financial and military support to Turkey's outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK), adding that this will worsen the two
countries' relations.
</P>
<P>
Greece, however, categorically denied the charges, saying that
Turkey's claims are aimed at defaming Greece's international
reputation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds over a number of issues
concerning the Aegean, including air space limits, sea-bed
mineral resources, as well as sovereignty over many uninhabited
islets.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Says He Hopes Stock Market Remain Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- While praising the underlying
fundamental elements of the country's economy, President Bill
Clinton expressed his hopes here Thursday to maintain the stock
market steady and avoid big swings.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. leader made the remarks at a press conference on a day
when the Commerce Department reported that the GDP growth in the
first quarter of this year is robust without signs of higher
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he believed the country will be able to avoid any
"big swings in the market one way or another" as long as investors
have as much information as possible.
</P>
<P>
"What is important here is for all the informed people... all
of us need to talk about what the fundamentals are, what the facts
are, or if there are any reasons for caution," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are concerns that the stock market has been
soaring too high and may be headed for a fall.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the national interest for all... potential investors
to have as much information as possible. Markets will go up and
down, they will change," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to avoid having a big bubble that pops is to make
sure we have open information... about where we are now," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the good economic figures released by the
government today, the president hailed what he called "an American
economic renaissance." But he cautioned Congress against spending
projected government surpluses for overly generous tax cuts or new
spending programs.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow the hum of our growing prosperity to lull us
into complacency," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
The government reported earlier today that U.S. economic growth
had picked up speed during the first three months of the year,
stimulated by a computer-buying heat that helped offset
deteriorating trade with trouble-ridden Asia.
</P>
<P>
The nation's gross domestic product (GDP), the sum of all goods
and services produced within U.S. borders, increased at a rapid
seasonally adjusted 4.2 percent annual rate in the January-March
quarter, the Commerce Department reported.
</P>
<P>
That was up from a 3.7 percent rate in the final three months
of 1997 and was the fastest pace in a year.
</P>
<P>
Increased computer purchases by both individuals and businesses
accounted for the step-up in first-quarter economic growth.
Without it, the economy would have grown at a 3.5 percent pace,
the department said.

cooperation, particularly, in the fields of science and
technology, culture, tourism, trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique was signed by Ethiopian Foreign Minister

</P>
<P>
The communique said they also agreed to encourage and support

ventures jointly or directly in both countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries further agreed to immediately reactivate the

broadening the foundation of bilateral cooperation and
friendship.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the communique said, they have agreed to

the two sides have underlined the necessity of providing
all-round support to the Somali people and of engaging them in a
direct and peaceful dialog aimed at achieving national
reconciliation and peace in the country.

<HEADLINE> SADC Ministers Support Int'l Criminal Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Justice ministers from
southern African countries on Thursday expressed their support
for the establishment of an international criminal court.
</P>
<P>
But they cautioned that such a court should be independent and
free from manipulation, South African Justice Minister Dullah
Omar said.
</P>
<P>
A common position on the issue was developed at a ministerial
meeting of the 12-nation Southern African Development Community
(SADC) in Namibian capital Windhoek on Thursday, South African
Press Association quoted Omar as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The SADC ministers were unanimous that an effective way must
be found to bring to justice those who committed crimes of
genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and aggression,"
Omar said in a statement released after his return to Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
He said that situations had arisen where national justice
systems had collapsed and an international criminal court was
needed to help deal with such criminals.
</P>
<P>
But the delegates also expressed their fears that such a court
could become a pawn in the hands of powerful interests or could
be used for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, SADC countries would insist that the court be
independent and impartial and not be manipulated by financial
considerations or by powerful political interests, Omar said.
</P>
<P>
The prosecuting authority itself should be independent and
free from manipulation, either by the United Nations Security
Council or any state, and all parties should have the right to
make representations to the prosecuting authority, he said.
</P>
<P>
The issue would be discussed at the U.N. diplomatic conference
in Rome in June this year, Omar said.
</P>
<P>
He said the idea of an international criminal court first
arose after World War II, but was not pursued due to lack of
support.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, and as a result of events in parts
of Europe and Africa, the idea had been revived and had gathered
momentum, said Omar.

<HEADLINE> International Tribunal for Rwanda to be Expanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
adopted a resolution on Thursday, deciding to establish a third
Trial Chamber of the International Tribunal for Rwanda due to "the
large number of accused awaiting trial".
</P>
<P>
The resolution said Council members believed that the
prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of
international humanitarian law will contribute to the process of
national reconciliation and to the restoration and maintenance of
peace in Rwanda and in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal was set up in Arusha, Tanzania in 1994 following a
Rwanda genocide which killed a large number of people in the East
African country.
</P>
<P>
A Security Council resolution dated November 8, 1994 said the
Council will decide to consider increasing the number of judges
and Trial Chambers if it becomes necessary.
</P>
<P>
Today's resolution expands the Tribunal by adding another Trial
Chamber with three judges. The elections for the judges of the
three Trial Chambers will be held together for a term of office to
expire on May 24, 2003.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Satisfied with Outcome of Big-Power Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Thursday
said that the big-power meeting in Rome on Kosovo was successful
and predicted that new sanctions on Yugoslavia would have a
"significant chilling effect" on the struggling Serb economy.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Rome on Wednesday, the six-nation Contact Group
decided to impose an immediate freeze of Yugoslav assets abroad
and threatened to add an investment ban if there was no progress
by May 9 on the Kosovo crisis. Russia did not agree to the new
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said the meeting was
successful, adding that the focus was no longer on divisions
within the Contact Group, which comprises Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Foley stressed that the Contact Group has acted and "the ball"
is solely in Belgrade's court.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Washington, which had earlier threatened to
abandon the Contact Group if it did not decide firm measures, was
satisfied with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. believes that these measures will have a significant
"chilling effect on the Serb economy," said Foley.
</P>
<P>
"It is a message to not only international investors and
entrepreneurs, but indeed to investors and entrepreneurs inside
Serbia that the prospects for a good return on their money are
dimming and almost nil under current circumstances," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As bad as the Serbian economy is today, it can get a lot
worse," Foley added.
</P>
<P>
He said there were some "significant prospective investments"
pending for Yugoslavia which would be affected by the new ban, if
it was implemented.
</P>
<P>
The funds freeze "restricts the ability of the (Yugoslav) and
Serbian governments to move money freely through international
financial markets, restricting Belgrade's access to the global
economy", Foley said.

But, referring to promises to re-integrate Yugoslavia into the

"All members of the Contact Group are firmly opposed to the
independence for Kosovo and to a continuation of the unacceptable
status quo," Foley stressed.

<HEADLINE> Intel Turns Attention to Cameras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Kodak, a leader in the photography
industry, and Intel, the world's major computer chip maker,
announced a joint marketing and developing alliance Friday to
promote digital imaging.
</P>
<P>
The two companies will try to spur the coming of digital
photography to the mass market by offering lower-cost digital
imaging solutions. The agreement includes joint development of new
products, an upgrade of Kodak's photo development labs with Intel
products, and a joint 150 million U.S. dollar marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
Kodak eventually will offer "Picture CDs" made using
Intel-based computers. These picture CDs will allow consumers to
store their photos on CDs and print them at retail stores.
</P>
<P>
Digital photography, which allows users to store and manipulate
images on their PCs, is widely expected to grow in popularity
during the next year. Prices continue to drop for high-resolution
cameras and easy-to-use applications for manipulating images are
beginning to proliferate.
</P>
<P>
Market experts predicted that 3 million digital cameras will be
sold this year, and that will double by next year. But that is not
a big piece of overall market -- 20,000 pictures are taken every
second.
</P>
<P>
Experts also said that a boost to the market needs more
technology advancement. People have to rely on computers to get
their pictures out. The advent of printers that can read and
print directly from cameras would be one key technology that
could help the digital imaging market take off.

<HEADLINE> Civil Mediation System Ensures Harmony in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- When a couple in Yuyuan Street, a
crowded district in this east China metropolis, quarreled over
some trifle, their neighbors called in a mediator named "Aunt
Huang".
</P>
<P>
With great patience, Aunt Huang persuaded the couple to set
aside their differences and become reconciled.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old woman has been a mediator for more than three
decades on the Fumin (Bringing Happiness to the People)
Neighborhood Committee, which looks after 1,300 families, for more
than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jinhua is one of the 100,000 civil mediators in the
municipality of Shanghai, a job which is nowadays regarded as
indispensable to the normal life of the growing population in this
city with 13 million residents and more than three million
transients already.
</P>
<P>
According to the Municipal Justice Department, the civil
mediators have, over the past three years, solved 180,000 civil
cases, greatly alleviating the pressure on the local courts.
</P>
<P>
The system of civil mediation is a unique creation of China's
legal system.
</P>
<P>
Civil mediators are made up of judicial assistants, clerks
of neighborhood committees and some senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
Along with local economic and social development, more than
10,000 community dispute mediation centers have been set up in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
These centers gather together personnel from the police,
housing administration and administration of industry and commerce
organs to tackle unexpected occurrences in the communities with
the help of the civil mediators.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, on Northern Zhongshan Street in Puduo
District, the civil engineering department asked 58 households to
demolish some illegal structures when they refused to do so, the
resulting furor was settled with the help of mediators.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many local communities in Shanghai have also set up
legal assistance offices.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cities in Festive Mood on May Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Early this morning, over 3,000
people, including model workers and a group of trade union members
from Hong Kong, joined some 3,000 local residents to watch the
raising of the national flag in Tiananmen Square here.
</P>
<P>
This was part of a series of activities in the Chinese capital to
celebrate International Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
Like Beijing, all the cities across the country became oceans
of flowers today as Chinese regard May Day as one of the most
important festivals in the year.
</P>
<P>
In the three other municipalities of Shanghai, Tianjin and
Chongqing, all important industrial bases of the country, large
numbers of festive activities were held, including art
performances, sports competitions and exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
"As workers, we should always stand in the front line of the
reform," said Fan Yushu, a national model worker in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
This year, May Day was more eye-catching than ever, as it was
the first anniversary of the return of Hong Kong to the motherland
and the first year for carrying out the policies announced at the
15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
In Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province in the south,
large numbers of local people were attracted to the streets by
fashion shows, music performances and free medical consultations,
held by local artists and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region,
more than 4,000 local industrial workers gathered in the square
in front of the Potala Palace to mark the festival.
</P>
<P>
Local workers were urged by the leadership of the region's
trade unions to contribute to the region's political stability and
economic development, and the national unity and social progress.
</P>
<P>
In Harbin, the capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province, local residents flew hundreds of kites to celebrate the
festival.
</P>
<P>
"I want to fly my kite as high as possible, so as to pray for
the improvement of our lives day by day and for the prosperity of
our motherland," said Qu Jing, a laid-off factory worker who has
now found a new job.
</P>
<P>
A get-together was also held here this evening at the Great
Hall of the People to mark the May Day, which was attended by more
than 3,000 model workers from across the country. Wei Jianxing,
Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and member
of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, as well as Chairman of
the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) took part in
the gathering .
</P>
<P>
Zhang Dinghua, Vice-Chairman of ACFTU and member of the
Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, made a speech at the
gathering, to express lofty respect and warm salute to workers
from different industries.

MOSCOW -- A Russian representative to Chechnya was kidnapped
Friday, making it the first abduction of a senior Russian official.
</P>
<P>
The presidential envoy, Valentin Vlasov, was traveling in the
republic of Ingushetia, just a few kilometers from the border of
the breakaway Chechen Republic when he was abducted.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya and other neighboring republics have become fertile
territory for kidnappings since the Chechen war of secession ended
in august 1996.
</P>
<P>
Several armed men wearing fatigues forced the car carrying
Vlasov to stop at around 10:00 a.m. (0600 GMT) on the highway
between Rostov, the Republic of Ingushetia and Baku, Azerbaijan.

BRUSSELS -- European Commission President Jacques Santer has
hailed the launching of the single currency, the euro, as a
collective success.
</P>
<P>
At a pre-European summit press conference Friday, Santer said
the launch will be an irreversible process which is expected to
propel and catalyze the ensuing changes and developments in the
15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
The single currency will become a reality Saturday when
representatives from the member states confirm the 11 founding
countries.
</P>
<P>
The euro will make Europe stronger thanks to its creativity and
expertise, said the commission chief who described the euro as a
safe monetary haven that will create prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
From January 1, the euro will serve as the single currency for
the 11 countries the commission recommended as the founding
members on March 25, said Santer.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament approved the commission recommendation
Thursday in a vote of 402-79 with 27 abstentions. (EU-Santer-Euro)

<HEADLINE> Iran Blasts U.S. for Launching New Persian Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran's judiciary chief Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi on Friday lashed out at Washington for launching
new Persian radio station to destroy Iranian people's trust in the
government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Friday prayers congregation, Yazdi said that
the U.S. move is a sort of propaganda encirclement, the official
news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. congress recently approved a bill allocating 2.5
million U.S. dollars to launch the Radio Free Iran, which is
scheduled to begin broadcasting in September this year. The
decision was considered by Tehran as "intervention in Iran's
internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
Yazdi said that the U.S. has not yet appreciated the Islamic
system in Iran or the Iranian people who have never allowed anyone
to do anything against the ideological principles of Islam, adding
that the U.S schemes against Iran would be "fruitless" as before.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said recently that the
U.S. move to launch the radio station indicated its unwillingness
to break the wall of mistrust between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also stated that Iran feels no need to talk with the
U.S. since it has not changed its hostile stance toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been pursuing containment policies against
Tehran since the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979. It broke up
diplomatic ties with Iran after radical Iranian students occupied
the U.S. Embassy in Iran and took the staffers hostages in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Firm Plans to Export Great Lakes Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian company has won a
first-ever permit from the Ontario provincial government to export
water from Lake Superior to Asia, causing a fury in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Nova Group in the city of Sault Ste. Marie has been granted
approval to take up to 600 million liters of water a year for the
next five years from the lake, the Globe and Mail newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
So far, the company has not arranged any sales yet. The permit
will allow it to conduct feasibility studies and attract potential
investors.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for water in the Asia market," said Nova
President John Febbraro. Selling water there "is worth a shot."
</P>
<P>
The company got the idea of selling Lake Superior water, the
cleanest of the Great Lakes, since on one has hit upon the idea of
selling water to Asia, a region often plagued by water shortages,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The export permit has caused an angry response from the United
States, which shares most of the Great Lakes with Canada.
</P>
<P>
It has prompted the Great Lakes Commission, an interstate
agency based in Michigan, to suggest that Ontario has violated the
boundary water treaty by allowing a water permit without
consultation with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
A Michigan congressman has asked the U.S. State Department to
look into the issue to see whether Ontario has violated Canada's
treaty obligations with the United States, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The company contended that exporting water to Asia could
provide jobs in a high-jobless region of Canada, while helping to
slake the thirst of parched areas in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Dam's Temporary Shiplock Begins Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The temporary shiplock of the
multi-billion yuan Three Gorges Dam Project, on the middle reaches
of the Yangtze River, went into operation today.
</P>
<P>
A simple opening ceremony was held at the site on the occasion,
without the participation of any ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
The "Gezhouba", a tour cruiser, became the first vessel through
the shiplock, which is 240 m in length and 24 m in width -- big
enough to hold a 3,000 dwt ship.
</P>
<P>
It only took 20 minutes for the "Gezhouba" to pass through the
shiplock, which is equipped with the most sophisticated equipment
in the world.
</P>
<P>
The shiplock is managed by the Yangtze River Department of
Navigation. It is used for shipping only when the water flow of
the river exceeds 10,000 cu m, usually during the flood
season. Under normal circumstances, a canal will be used for the
same purpose.
</P>
<P>
According to the official plan on the project, a permanent
shiplock, the world's largest, will be go into operation by the
year 2003.

<P>
BERLIN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi thundered second-seeded
Jonas Bjorkman 6-2, 6-2 on Friday to storm into the semifinals of
the BMW Open in Munich, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Agassi's opponent in the semifinal will be Galo Blanco of
Spain, who beat Tomas Nydahl of Sweden 7-5, 5-7, 7-6 (7-1) earlier.
</P>
<P>
The American broke Bjorkman's serve at the start of each set
and never dropped his own service to cruise into the last four.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, a former No. 1 in the world, fell as low as No. 141
last year. But after winning two tournaments this year, Agassi is
now ranked No. 20.
</P>
<P>
The rapid-fire match was in stark contrast to the day's first
clay court marathon. It took nearly three hours for Blanco finally
to win over Nydahl.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Magnus Gustafsson and seventh seed Thomas Enqvist were
due on court for the day's concluding quarter-finals depending on
the weather.
</P>
<P>
Four Swedes started in the quarter-finals for the first time on
the ATP Tour since the Swedish Open last summer.
</P>
<P>
Gustafsson, who has already won a title this year at age 31,
faces Frenchman Nicolas Escude, an Australian Open semi-fialist
who knocked out holder Mark Philippoussis in Munich.

<HEADLINE> Somali Clan Fighting Flares Up Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Reports from the Southern Somali
region of Lower Jubba indicate that fighting flared up Thursday
afternoon between the Majerten dominated militiamen led by
General Mohamed Said Hirsi Morgan and the Marehan sub-clan.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources from Kansuma and Jilib towns indicate that
the Marehan militiamen loyal to the Somali National Front (SNF)
who have been ousted from Kismayu last year, have regained
control of the strategic town of Kansuma after a bitter fighting
which lasted for nearly two hours.
</P>
<P>
The strategic bridge town of Kansuma which lies on the road
linking Mogadishu to Kismayu has fallen to General Morgan's
militiamen a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
The sources also said that the Marehan militiamen who have
received reinforcements of militiamen and ammunition from Gedo
region considerably have made an advance of 30 km toward Kismayu
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, General Morgan's militiamen are
currently stationed at Arare bridge, 60 km North of Kismayu.
</P>
<P>
There are no exact casualty figures on either side. However,
confirmed reports say that at least nine people were killed and
more than 21 others were wounded as the fighting between the two
sides continued till Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The wounded include 15 militiamen belonging to General
Morgan's forces who have been hospitalized Friday morning in
Kismayu for gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
More than 19 militiamen from General Morgan's side are
reportedly missing since the fighting began late Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the Marehan militiamen here in
Mogadishu, his forces who found their first defensive position
just five kilometers south of the important town of Jilib, 170 km
North of Kismayu, were provoked by the Majerten militiamen.
</P>
<P>
However, the Majertens charged that they had been attacked by
what they called Marehan militiamen accompanied by Hussein
Aidid's battle wagons, a claim flatly denied by Aidid's officials
here in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it is known that Aidid's followers have been
sympathetic to the Marehan militiamen since they are supporting
the Cairo peace deal signed late last year.
</P>
<P>
During the fighting in which more than 15 battle wagons were
involved, the Marehan militiamen have captured one battle wagon
mounted with a double barrel anti-aircraft heavy machine gun.
</P>
<P>
The two sides of Marehan and Majerten sub-clans of Darod have
been fighting for control of Kismayu since last year.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has, since last week, spread to territories
controlled by Hussein Aidid's faction when a few of his militia
camps were overrun by the advancing Majerten militiamen.
</P>
<P>
About 70 people are believed to have died and more than a
hundred others were wounded since the fighting restarted between
the two sides nearly 10 days ago.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Workers Threaten Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's labor movement Friday
resolved to stage another nationwide work boycott, this time for
five days, to press the government to scrap unpopular taxes and
levies.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (Zctu) also set 2,000
Zimbabwean Dollars (121 U.S. Dollars) as the basic monthly
minimum wage they are prepared to settle for in the impending
collective bargaining exercise with employers.
</P>
<P>
At a May Day rally at Harare's Rufaro stadium to celebrate
International Workers Day Friday, Zctu Secretary-General Morgan
Tsvangirai told a crowd of about 20,000 that workers in Zimbabwe
wanted the 2.5 percent increase on sales tax and the five percent
development levy removed.
</P>
<P>
The labor movement organized a two-day national job stay-away
on March 3 and 4 to pressure the government to scrap the tax and
development levy but there has been no response so far from the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai also spoke against police brutality on civilian
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
He said it was saddening to see a police officer ''beating his
own brother'' when he himself cannot afford to buy a bag of
mealie-meal because of the rising costs.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Euro Countries Combine to Form World's Major Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- European Commission's statistical
bureau, Eurostat, claimed on Friday that the 11 euro countries
will create an economy more than comparable to the United States
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the 11 euro countries generated 5.546 trillion ECUs
(6.156 trillion U.S. dollars) in gross domestic product, compared
with 6.848 trillion ECUs (7.601 trillion U.S. dollars) by the
United States and 3.712 trillion ECUs (4.12 trillion U.S. dollars)
by Japan, Eurostat said in a special report.
</P>
<P>
The euro 11 GDP, though 19 percent below the U.S. level, is
49 percent above the level of Japan. But Eurostat admitted that
measured in terms of per-capita real purchasing power, the euro
11 GDP is still below the U.S. and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The euro zone, however, will churn out a world-beating trade
volume as the euro 11 already account for one-fifth of the world's
exports last year, whereas the United States accounted for 16
percent and Japan for 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The euro 11 trade balance was strong in surplus, with nearly 90
billion ECUs (99.9 billlion U.S. dollars), while the United States
recorded a deficit of 183 billion ECUs (203.13 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The euro 11, Eurostat said, consumed less gross inland energy
per person and emitted less greenhouse gases as well.

<HEADLINE> S. African Mediator Meets Irish PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A South African Minister met
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Aherne in Dublin Friday to discuss
the most pressing challenges arising from the newly-reached
accord on Northern Ireland's future.
</P>
<P>
South African Constitutional Development Minister Valli Moosa
and three other African National Congress (ANC) officials were
visiting Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland at a
special request of Sinn Fein to facilitate talks between
political parties.
</P>
<P>
Moosa's meeting with Aherne follows high-level discussions,
personal and telephonic, with leaders across the political
spectrum in Northern Ireland, The Star paper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moosa met Paul Murphy, Britain's Minister of State in Northern
Ireland, to get the government's perspective on the April 10
agreement signed in Belfast Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I was quite encouraged by their commitment, and the fact that
Murphy was very optimistic that within two years, all political
prisoners would be released," Moosa said.
</P>
<P>
The release of political prisoners, the disarmament of
paramilitary forces and the integration of former prisoners and
paramilitaries into future security forces are among the most
complex issues arising from the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which will be voted on by the people of
Northern Ireland in a referendum on May 22, sets out a
dispensation in which Northern Ireland parties will join the
British and Irish governments in ruling the province.
</P>
<P>
Moosa also had talks with David Trimble, leader of the Ulster
Unionist Party, and David Irvine, of the Progressive Unionist
Party, and addressed a public meeting in the center of Dublin
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), said the South African experience of negotiating a
peaceful transition from apartheid to democracy would contribute
to the peace process in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But unionist parties said the ANC-only delegation was
one-sided and would harm rather than help the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Police, Leftists Clash in May Day Demonstrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Police and left-wing demonstrators
clashed Friday in the eastern German city of Leipzig.
</P>
<P>
The clashes erupted as Some 5,000 leftist demonstrators tried
to force their way into a square in the city of Leipzig to
confront a mass rally organized by the far-right National
Democratic Party of Germany (NPD).
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators, some masked and many carrying anti-Nazi slogans,
hurled stones, bottles and fireworks at policemen who tried to
prevent violent confrontations between the left- and right-wingers.
</P>
<P>
Police used several water cannons to dispurse the protesters.
Several policemen were injured and about five leftist
demonstrators were detained.
</P>
<P>
Leipzig courts and municipal authorities had earlier banned the
NPD from organizing their May Day demonstrations in the city. A
higher court later overruled the ban, allowing the far-right party
to hold a rally, but still banning them from marching through the
city.
</P>
<P>
Police said that about 6,000 NPD supporters had gathered in
Leipzig Friday morning to attend the rally. The NPD said earlier
that they expected about 15,000 people to turn up.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations came amid fears of an upsurge of right
extremism in eastern Germany after another far-right party, the
German People Union DVU, rose from obscurity to score a stunning
12.9 percent of the vote in the local legislature election in the
eastern German Saxony-Anhalt state last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
German trade unions were planning to hold demonstrations Friday
to protest the rise of right extremism. An open-air concert was
held Thursday night in Leipzig under the motto: "Leipzig Shows
Courage."

<HEADLINE> Air Quality Report for China's Major Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua released today the latest
weekly air quality report on major Chinese cities from the China
Environmental Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
It gives the air quality atmospheric pollution index (API) of
sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOX) and total suspended
particles (TSP).
</P>
<P>
Air quality is listed on five levels by the State
Environmental Protection Administration. An API from 0 to 50 is
level I, meaning excellent air quality; 51 to 100 is level II, or
good quality; 101 to 200 is level III, or slight pollution; 201 to
300 is level IV, or medium pollution; and above 300 is level V, or
heavy pollution.
</P>
<P>
This week's report says that, from April 24 to 30, rain
cleansed the environment in most cities.
</P>
<P>
The API for Guangzhou, Hohhot, Zhengzhou, Shijiazhuang,
Changchun and Beijing was above 100, and the biggest problem in
those cities was TSP, except for Guangzhou, where the biggest
problem was NOX.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one cities, including Harbin, Chongqing and Guiyang, had
good air quality, with API level II. Fuzhou, Beihai, Ningbo,
Zhuhai and Xiamen had excellent air quality, with API level I.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russia's Envoy to Chechnya Abducted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A Russian representative to Chechnya
was kidnapped Friday, making it the first abduction of a senior
Russian official.
</P>
<P>
The presidential envoy, Valentin Vlasov, was traveling in the
republic of Ingushetia, just a few kilometers from the border of
the breakaway Chechen Republic when he was abducted.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya and other neighboring republics have become fertile
territory for kidnappings since the Chechen war of secession ended
in august 1996.
</P>
<P>
Several armed men wearing fatigues forced the car carrying
Vlasov to stop at around 10:00 a.m. (0600 GMT) on the highway
between Rostov, the Republic of Ingushetia and Baku, Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin immediately briefed Yeltsin
and Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on the abduction.
</P>
<P>
A task force was established by the interior ministry to
thoroughly investigate the location on Yeltsin's instructions.
</P>
<P>
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said he would personally
direct the investigation, while Chechen Deputy Prime Minister
Kazbek Makhashev reportedly visited the scene of the abduction.
</P>
<P>
Some 65 hostages, including at least six foreigners, are
currently being held hostage in Chechnya, according to statistics
by a special Chechen anti-abduction unit.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: China's Foreign Trade Has Bright Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 1 (Xinhua) -- In 1997 China became the
10th-biggest international trader in the world, but some people
have doubts about its future prospects in this field, due to the
current financial turmoil in some Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The just-closed 83rd China Export Commodity Trade Fair, which
was held in this capital of Guangdong Province, witnessed a record
number of visitors and did 10.2 billion US dollars-worth of
business.
</P>
<P>
"This year China's exports are really facing challenges," said
Liu Xiangdong, assistant minister of foreign trade and economic
co-operation. "But the year's goal of exporting 200 billion US
dollars-worth of goods can be reached without any doubt, if we
make concerted efforts."
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade has been one of the main driving forces behind
China's high-speed economic growth in the past two decades. Since
the country launched its reform and opening drive in the late 1970s
its ranking in the world has moved up from 32nd place to 10th
place, and now accounts for 3.8 percent of the world's total trade.
</P>
<P>
The current financial crisis in East Asia has had a negative
impact on China's foreign trade, as currency depreciations in
other parts of Asia are weakening the competitiveness of Chinese
goods in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, the pluralistic strategy China has adopted to promote
its foreign trade under the current circumstances has proved
effective.
</P>
<P>
During the Guangzhou fair the number of orders from the
Republic of Korea and Southeast Asian nations declined
drastically, as expected, and orders from traditional markets like
the countries of the European Community and North America grew by
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of orders from new markets in Eastern
Europe, South America and Africa climbed rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The new situation in the world market has brought about great
changes in China's foreign trade pattern.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation Shi
Guangsheng has urged local exporters to further develop
traditional European and American markets, explore potential
markets in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and
Eastern Europe, and pay more attention to opening new markets,
such as in Saudi Arabia, in order to make up for losses in other
parts of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign businessmen attending the Guangzhou fair agreed
that China's stable political and economic environment is a
powerful guarantee for exports.
</P>
<P>
Some experts held that the negative effects on China from
the Asian financial crisis are merely indirect and temporary, and
will help the country to revise its foreign trade plans.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government plans to increase the country's foreign
trade to 400 billion US dollars-worth by the year 2000, and to 800
billion US dollars-worth by 2010.

WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Senate on Thursday night approved a historic
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include
three former Cold War enemies: Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
-- A Russian political crisis that erupted five weeks ago ended
uneventfully Thursday as President Boris Yeltsin stocked his new
government mostly with reformist holdovers from the previous
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States is preparing to back a 1 billion U.S.
dollar payment in international emergency aid to Indonesia,
despite evidence that President Suharto's family and friends are
undermining efforts to break up multi-billion-dollar monopolies.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Congressional Republicans stared down the Clinton
Administration, passing a 6 billion U.S. dollar emergency spending
bill and winning President Clinton's promise to sign it, enen
though it failed to provide money he had sought to replenish the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. economy grew at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the

<HEADLINE> Chief of European Central Bank to Be Chosen by Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
President Jacques Santer on Friday brushed aside rumors that the
EC would pick the president of the European Central Bank (ECB) in
a round-about way.
</P>
<P>
"The commission must make sure the (Maastricht) Treaty is not
breached," Santer said at a pre-European summit press conference.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that a compromise may have to be made in
order to choose one of the current two candidates for the ECB
post. Suggestions include splitting the tenure between the two
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Santer said the eight-year unrenewable tenure had to be adhered
to and the commission was not going to renew the mandate of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Germany and the Netherlands are backing Wim Duisenberg for ECB
president. He is currently head of the European Monetary
Institute, the forerunner of the ECB. France however is
championing French central bank governor Jean-Claude Trichet.
</P>
<P>
According to commission sources, the agreement due to take
shape on Saturday would give the ECB presidency to Duisenberg and
the vice-presidency to Trichet, so that the latter can take over
when the 63-year-old Dutchman steps down.
</P>
<P>
The choice of the ECB president has become a hot potato among
commission officials and their counterparts from the 15 European
Union member states.
</P>
<P>
Tony Blair, Britain's prime minister, went to the Netherlands
on Friday for a lightning visit to talk with his Dutch equivalent
Wim Kok about the choice of ECB president.
</P>
<P>
Britain is serving as the six-month rotating presidency of the
union.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty, signed in early 1991, requires that the
ECB executive board consist of a president, a vice president and
four members.
</P>
<P>
When asked how to distribute the seats on the board to
represent the big as well as small and southern as well as
northern countries in the union, European Commissioner for
monetary affairs Yves Thibault de Silguy said ECB executive board
members are experts of financial and monetary affairs and not
representatives of countries.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty dictates that the board members "shall be
appointed from among persons of recognized standing and
professional experience in monetary or banking matters. The
appointment is by common accord of the governments of the member
states at the level of heads of state and government, on a
recommendation from the council, after it has consulted the
European Parliament and the governing council of the ECB."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Angolan-S. African Ties Entering Into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela wound up his first State visit to Angola Thursday, one
which is widely hailed as a success that has brought the
bilateral ties between the two countries into a new stage.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Mandela expressed his thanks to Angola for
its unselfish aid during the anti-apartheid days and reiterated
South Africa's continued support to Angola's peace effort.
</P>
<P>
Mandela pledged in his two-day visit that as a member of the
United Nations, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the
Southern African Development Community (SADC), South Africa would
abide by U.N. Security Council's resolution on the sanctions
against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
He declared that his government has placed the airports
offering cargo flights services for UNITA under tight control.
</P>
<P>
All these pledges are seen as a new development of the ties
between the two friendly nations in their long years of struggle
for freedom and peace.
</P>
<P>
A newly-independent state in those days, Angola served as a
vast rear base of logistics, military and "unselfish political
backup" for Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) in its
anti-apartheid struggle and had made great contributions to
ending racial segregation in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, in turn, has been offering tremendous support to
Angola in its peace effort, since the ANC came to power in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also contributed his bit to Angola's peace process,
using his special relations with the Angolan government and Jonas
Savimbi, the UNITA leader.
</P>
<P>
However, the reported incidents that some South African
aircraft had invaded the territorial air space of Angola,
delivering cargoes to forces of the opposition UNITA movement,
have cast a shadow in the ties of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's visit has, as hailed by many, removed the shadow and
laid a solid basis for future development of the bilateral ties
between South Africa and Angola.
</P>
<P>
Another task high on the agenda of Mandela's visit was to
strengthen the economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed an agreement on the basic principles
in developing bilateral cooperation, which is regarded by Mandela
as a sound foundation for the tightening of mutual beneficial
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, both in the southern African region, are
complementary to each other in economy. While South Africa's
technology could be used in tapping the rich mineral resources in
Angola, and in helping the latter rehabilitate its war-torn
economy, Angola's huge market would attract South Africa's
surplus labor force, thus helping to promote and stabilize its
economy.
</P>
<P>
Both influential in the SADC, the development of the relations
between Angola and South Africa are seen as helpful to the peace,
stability and development in Southern Africa.

<HEADLINE> Santer Hails Euro As Collective Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Jacques Santer hailed the launching of the single currency, the
euro, as a collective success.
</P>
<P>
At a pre-European summit press conference Friday, Santer said
the launch will be an irreversible process which is expected to
propel and catalyze the ensuing changes and developments in the
15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
The single currency will become a reality Saturday when
representatives from the member states confirm the 11 founding
countries.
</P>
<P>
The euro will make Europe stronger thanks to its creativity and
expertise, said the commission chief who described the euro as a
safe monetary haven that will create prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
From January 1, the euro will serve as the single currency for
the 11 countries the commission recommended as the founding
members on March 25, said Santer.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament approved the commission recommendation
Thursday in a vote of 402-79 with 27 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation still has to be confirmed by the council
meeting of the European finance and economy ministers and the
summit of the heads of state and government. Both groups are
slated to meet Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The euro zone, with a population of 291 million, will account
for 19.4 percent of the world's gross domestic product (GDP) and
18.6 percent of world trade.
</P>
<P>
The 11 euro countries, which consist of Germany, France, Italy,
Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Finland, Ireland,
Portugal and Austria, generated a GDP of 5.546 trillion European
Currency Units (6.186 trillion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
British, Sweden and Denmark have decided to stay away from the
euro, and Greece failed to fulfill the criteria for the
first-round launch.

<HEADLINE> Asian Economies to Begin Recovery in 1999: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Most members of the Asian Development
Bank's (ADB) Board of Governors expect to see a recovery, by some
countries, from the Asian financial crisis next year.
</P>
<P>
The recovery is expected as bold reforms in the crisis-affected
countries bear fruit, ADB President Mitsuo Sato said at the close
of the 31st annual ADB board meeting here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"These economies are expected to begin recovering in 1999,"
Sato said, adding that their sustained growth is likely to resume
"over the medium-term on an even more solid ground than in the
past."
</P>
<P>
Despite the region's momentary difficulties, the governors said
many of the economic fundamentals that propelled Asia's remarkable
achievements in the past three decades remain intact.
</P>
<P>
The governors, however, said this is no time for complacency
and continued close monitoring of the situation is essential.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day board meeting from April 29 to May 1, the
governors reviewed economic and policy developments of the
Asia-Pacific region and assessed the ADB's performance.
</P>
<P>
The governor of the central bank of the Philippines has been
elected the new chairman of the Board of Governors of the
57-member ADB.
</P>
<P>
The 32nd annual meeting of the ADB Board of Governors will be
held in Manila from April to May 2, 1999, where the ADB is based.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Macao SARPC Catches Wide Attention in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Macao have focused their
eyesight on the Macao Special Administrative Region Preparatory
Committee (SARPC) since a name list of the committee was made
public on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The birth of the committee, which is expected next week in
Beijing, has been waited for so long by many of them here in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Some observers here said that judging from the name list,
Beijing is serious in keeping its promise of having more than
half of its members from Macao.
</P>
<P>
The 100-strong committee has 60 Macao members, including as
many as possible representatives from different communities and
all walks of life. They represent a wide range of trades and
communities, such as industry, commerce, religion, education
group, artist, grassroots organizations, lawyers, engineers,
retired civil servant and Macao-born Portuguese residents.
</P>
<P>
"The list shows that China has high determination in carrying
out the policy of 'one country, two systems,'" said a commentary
in Thursday's Correio Macaenese Daily, adding "Beijing wants to
unite all those who are willing to contribute to China's
reunification course."
</P>
<P>
Many SARPC members said they will do their best to meet the
expectations from both the motherland and the residents of Macao
when they were interviewed.
</P>
<P>
Ng Fok, SARPC vice-chairman and general manager of the Ng k
Group Co. LTD, said that he feels trusted and honored as well as
having a great responsibility when being appointed a SARPC member.
</P>
<P>
"I will do my best," he said in an interview on Thursday. "The
committee is entrusted with a great mission of establishing the
Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), and we should be united
and do our best for that."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile some members said that they are ready to listen to
opinions from all sides. Even Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua
News Agency Macao Branch and SARPC vice-chairman, said that the
committee will take into consideration of whatever opinions there
might be so long as they are conducive to China's resumption of
the exercise of sovereignty over Macao, to the implementation of
the basic law and for the benefits of the Macao residents.
</P>
<P>
Among the tasks of the committee are to make regulations on the
establishment of a selection committee responsible for the
formation of the 1st SAR Government, its legislature and
law-enforcement body, to make proposals on major legal issues and
on smooth transition in such fields as economy, social order and
cultural affairs.
</P>
<P>
Although some people pin hopes on the committee in recovering
a slow-down economy and maintaining social orders, Chinese
officials in Macao strongly deny that the committee will
constitute any second power in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, Xinhua director, stressed that the Chinese side
respects the Portuguese administration before the handover on
December 20, 1999. "The SARPC will constitute no second political
power in Macao," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Government instantly responded to the name list on
Wednesday night after part of the name list was announced.
</P>
<P>
It pledges full support of the committee. Macao Governor Vasco
Rocha Vieira said that his government will cooperate and fully
support the work of the SARPC on the basis of respecting each
other's rights and power.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the governor has quickly named his secretary for
administration, education and youth affairs, Jorge Rangel, as
liaison man between his government and the SARPC.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, China to Further Boost Border Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GILGIT, Pakistan, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and China agreed
here on Friday that steps should be taken to further boost the
growing border trade between the two friendly countries.
</P>
<P>
Border trade between Pakistan and China "has a great potential
and a better future," Adbul Latif Khan, chief secretary of the
Northern Areas of Pakistan, told Yuan Hanmin, a senior official
from the Khumjerab Dry Port of China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
Abdul expressed his satisfaction with the sound development of
the bilateral economic cooperation between Pakistan and China,
especially between the neighboring Xinjiang and the Northern
Areas.
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, the trade volume across the border has risen
from the initial 240,000 rupees (5,500 U.S. dollars) to about 200
million rupees (4.5 million dollars)," Abdul said.
</P>
<P>
In this context, he said the Karakoram highway, which he
described as a "marvelous wonder" in the world, has played an
important role in strengthening trade ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Karakoram highway, which was jointly built by Pakistan and
China during 1966-1972, has become an important economic lifeline
between Pakistan and China, Abdul added.
</P>
<P>
Yuan, who is heading a 12-member delegation, agreed with Abdul
and said that further measures need to be taken to push forward
both the traditional friendship and the booming border trade
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Chinese delegation called on Khurshid Alam Khan,
inspector general of police of the Northern Areas.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, both sides expressed satisfaction with the
close cooperation between the border security forces of the two
countries in carrying out emergency rescue operations, in battling
smuggling, and in maintaining stability in the border areas.
</P>
<P>
They are also confident that the two sides will continue their
cooperation in the future for the benefits of the two peoples.

<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
announced here Friday a package of benefits for those Filipino
workers, who may be displaced as a result of the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at a meeting marking the Labor Day, Ramos said he
has approved, effective Friday, an increase in the minimum monthly
pension of retirement, death, and disability pensioners as of May
23, l997, from 1,500 pesos (37 U.S. dollars) to 2,400 pesos (about
60 dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the beneficiaries of the increase are only members of the
Social Security System (SSS) with at least 20 credited years of
service, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the Social Security System will also implement a 200
million peso (5 million dollars) low interest emergency loan
program for its members, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the Social Security System is tasked to
implement social security protection for workers in the private
sector, while the Government Service Insurance System takes care
of workers in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, a representative of the SSS announced that the
security system will also allocate 300 million pesos (7 million
dollars) annually to its members in the next five years as
easy-credit housing assistance.

<HEADLINE> World Food Program Warns of Afghan Food Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) expressed grave concern Friday over increasing
reports from its field missions in Afghanistan that tens of
thousands of people may be facing starvation in the coming month.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release of WFP, the organization has five
missions exploring the central Afghanistan region of Hazarajat,
home to some 1.2 million people, who under the best of
circumstances, eke out a rough living in mountain-clinging
villages.
</P>
<P>
The missions, traveling on foot, by truck or on horseback, have
been sending back preliminary information on severe hunger,
dwindling food supplies and empty market places.
</P>
<P>
They have filed unconfirmed reports of as many as 100 deaths
from starvation, mostly women and children.
</P>
<P>
The Hazarajat region, comprising Bamian province and parts of
Ghor, Wardak, Uruzgon and Ghazni provinces, has been isolated to
the south, west and east by a blockade imposed last year by the
Taliban militia, who control much of the rest of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban claim that food to Hazarajat feeds the armies of
their enemies, the Northern Alliance. WFP had distributed some
6,000 tons of potatoes and wheat in the early winter to Bamyan and
Ghor, which may have allowed a good proportion of the population
to survive the winter.
</P>
<P>
But re-supply from WFP store houses to the north in Uzbekistan
has been blocked for months due to the winter weather.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that at the end of the winter, food stocks were
nearly empty throughout the vast, mountainous region. WFP last
week issued an appeal to donors for 300,000 U.S. dollars for
purchasing wheat and potatoes locally.
</P>
<P>
WFP has distributed wheat to several hundred families in the
Beshud district, who crossed a steep snow-clad mountain range on
foot to get food. Also this week, WFP began to purchase potatoes
and wheat from local farmers and to transport the supplies to more
needy areas.
</P>
<P>
WFP has also been opening roads to the north and west of Ghor,
to gain both information and access to food aid.
</P>
<P>
But even if that passage opens, WFP officials have warned that
the aid will be insufficient, and only a political decision to
lift the blockade to the south can restore normal life and trading
for the people of Hazarajat, and allow convoys of food aid from
WFP's better-stocked storehouses in neighboring Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and the Northern Alliance broke off talks in
Islamabad Thursday evening due to failure to agree on implementing
the Taliban's earlier commitment of lifting the blockade on
Hazarajat. The talks are to resume on Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A nine-year old Siberian tiger gave
birth to four cubs early this morning in the Beijing Zoo.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time the tiger, named Jisheng, has given
birth to four cubs at one time, according to Gao Guijun, its
keeper.
</P>
<P>
Gao said that Jisheng, who has given birth to 18 cubs after
five pregnancies, is one of more than 100 tigers at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
The cubs each weigh about one kg.
</P>
<P>
Siberian tigers are listed as animals under the first-class
protection in China.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Zoo, the largest of its kind and having the largest
number of tigers in China, first succeeded in breeding Siberian
tigers in 1956. Since then, other tigers in the zoo, such as South
China tigers and Sumatra tigers, have also given birth to cubs.

<HEADLINE> South African Army Chief Sued for False </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- An opposition party leader has
demanded three million Rand (600,000 U.S. Dollars) in damages from
South African Defense Force (SANDF) chief Georg Meiring for
naming him in a military intelligence report on an alleged coup
plot.
</P>
<P>
United Democratic Front (UDF) co-leader Bantu Holomisa
demanded the payment damages within 30 days or he would take the
matter to the High Court, Meiring was informed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter hand-delivered to SANDF headquarters in Pretoria,
Holomisa's lawyers said Meiring failed to refute the military
intelligence report and to establish the falsity of allegations
against Holomisa.
</P>
<P>
The report, which Meiring handed to President Nelson Mandela
in February, claimed that Holomisa, a former African National
Congress (ANC) official, and a number of other senior ANC members
are plotting to topple the government by force.
</P>
<P>
Among the implicated were Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, ex-wife
of Mandela, and SANDF Chief of Staff Siphiwe Nyanda, who was
believed to be a successor of Meiring after his previously
scheduled retirement next year.
</P>
<P>
The report was later found to be entirely without substance
and Meiring took early retirement last month amid controversy
following a leakage of the report's details to the media. He was
to step down on May 31 and Nyanda has been appointed to succeed
him.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Holomisa's lawyers said the report's
allegations against Holomisa were false and Meiring knew they
were false.
</P>
<P>
The report made Holomisa out to be a criminal, exposing him to
arrest and prosecution, and showed an intention for Holomisa to
"suffer to his personal and constitutional rights," the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
A SANDF spokesman said comment was inappropriate in the light
of possible civil litigation.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- All the 375 listed companies on
the Shenzhen Stock Exchange have revealed their annual profit
reports in 1997, most of them witnessing a substantial growth of
profits, compared with 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to stock experts here, about 70 percent of the listed
companies have seen marginal profit growth in 1997, with 56
maintaining an average 30 percent increase of after-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
The average annual pre-tax profit rate of the listed companies
is about 21.39 percent, with their after-tax profit growth rate
estimated at 20.77 percent, they said.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts say that high-tech enterprises and those with
restructured assets are favored by investors. The enterprises are
considered to have high yields.
</P>
<P>
The average profit rate of net assets of the listed high-tech
enterprises was about 14.5 percent last year, much higher than the
average of the listed companies.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Shenzhen Stock Exchange said that listed
companies have been required to explain in detail how the
funds raised through listing were used in 1997. Stock investors
have also been warned of market risks, since eight companies have
made losses for two successive years.

PARIS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Irish swimmer Michelle de Bruin has
arrived in Paris on Friday for a swimming meet but would not meet
anybody from the press.
</P>
<P>
De Bruin, under investigation for alleged manipulation of her

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Tehran has rejected the U.S. charges
that it is sponsoring state terrorism, saying Iran condemns all
forms of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported on Friday that
Tehran's permanent delegation to the United Nations on Thursday
issued a statement in response to U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's remarks earlier this week that Iran is among
the seven countries that sponsor terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Iran has for long been a victim of
terrorism, adding Albright's allegations were unsubstantial and
would only serve to deepen the mistrust between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The charges of sponsoring terrorism, along with the
allegations of undermining the Middle East peace process and
seeking weapons of mass destruction, were a key reason behind
Washington's isolation policy towards Iran.
</P>
<P>
Frequently rejecting the accusation, Iran claimed that a "wall
of mistrust" exists between the Iranian and the American nations
due to the U.S. hostile policies towards it.

KAMPALA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has deployed troops along
its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to fight
the ugandan rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) there.
</P>
<P>
This is in response to a security agreement Uganda signed with
the DRC on April 26, the New Vision paper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) were stationed in
Nyahuka, Bundibugyo district in west Uganda to flush out ADF
rebels who are trying to join forces with the remnants of the
late Mobutu Sese Seko's defeated army, the report said.

Top security sources said the Ugandan troops have been given
more logistics to ensure that the rebels in western Uganda do not
link up with Congolese outlaws to destabilize the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Fighting was reported to be going on in eastern DRC, where
Rwandan Hutu militia and former Zairean army soldiers had teamed
up against the Congolese government.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Imposes Life Imprisonment on Repeated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will provide life
imprisonment for repeated rape, planned murder, slaying a police
officer, or the killing of a hijack or robbery victim.
</P>
<P>
The harsh new crime laws, which come into effect as of Friday,
will also enforce harsher minimum penalties for violent offences
against children, including asault and rape.
</P>
<P>
In the toughest measure yet taken by parliament since the
first non-racial elections in 1994 to combat crime, the law
applies mandatory minimum sentences for violent crime for the
next two years, with parliament to review the situation in the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"If there is still no decline in the crime rate in this period
the operation can be extended by the president for one year at a
time, with the concurrence of parliament," the Department of
Justice said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which has been in the process of social
transformation since its abolished apartheid in 1994, has been
troubled with increasing crime rate.
</P>
<P>
The Government of National Unity led by President Nelson
Mandela has been making efforts to curb crime.
</P>
<P>
Under the latest criminal laws, a first offender will receive
a minimum of five year's imprisonment for any crime that involves
the use of a firearm, and 15 years for hijacking.
</P>
<P>
Gang rape, repeated rape of the same vicitim by one person,
and serial rape will carry a sentence of life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The sentence of life imprisonment will also be imposed where a
criminal kills somebody while committing or attempting to commit
robbery or rape, or in cases where there is repeated rape, gang
raping or serial rape.
</P>
<P>
Another clause requires a sentence of life imprisonment for a
person who rapes a girl under the age of 16 or a mentally ill
woman, or who commits rape "konwing that he has acquired Aids or
HIV".
</P>
<P>
Minimum sentences of 15 years for a first offence, whith 20
years for a second offence and 25 years for a third offence, are
set out for another set of crimes.
</P>
<P>
These include hijacking, robbery with aggravating
circumstances, dealing or smuggling in arms and ammunition, and
dealing or smuggling drugs valued at more than 50,000 Rand
(10,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Our society is saying we want the courts to deal in a tough
way with these cases," Justice Committee Chairman Johnny de Lange
told South African press Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It is trusted that the imposition of minimum sentences will
serve as a deterrent factor for offenders," he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Early Elections Postponed to April 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's early elections, which were
first fixed for March, 1999, have been postponed until April 18,
1999 after a compromise between the coalition government and its
main political ally, Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was decided during a meeting between Turkish Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz and the Republican People's Party (CHP)
Chairman Deniz Baykal late Thursday, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz was quoted as saying that he and his colleagues reject
the proposal put forward by the CHP suggesting an election
government led by an independent deputy.
</P>
<P>
He added that Turkish President Suleyman Demirel himself also
opposes an election government.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Yilmaz and Baykal agreed to hold local and
parliamentary elections in March, 1999. The CHP, with those
support the minority government is surviving, has conditioned its
support to the government on an early election.
</P>
<P>
They also reached consensus to establish an election government
headed by an independent deputy to make sure that there would not
be an election economy in the country from October to March.
</P>
<P>
But two junior coalition partners, the Left Democratic Party
(DSP) and Democratic Turkey Party (DTP), argued that there is no
need to form a so-called election government, saying that an early
election could be held at the moment Baykal withdraws his support
to the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, who is reluctant to annoy his partners, DSP leader
Bulent Ecevit and DTP leader Husamettin Cindoruk, said later that
what he and Baykal agreed on before is not a formal decision,
making Baykal very angry.
</P>
<P>
Following his Thursday's meeting with Yilmaz, Baykal announced
to the press that his deal with the prime minister has expired,
saying that the CHP will not be held responsible for "political
surprises that might pop up later."
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, however, gave a positive message to the CHP, saying
that he and his colleagues will continue to discuss with Baykal
on the matter of early elections.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is a great difference between me and
Mr. Baykal. There is a misunderstanding. We will compensate for
it in a few days," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local observers noted that the government and the CHP will
make further bargaining on the early election and a new
compromise will be possible.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Prepares National Policy on Child Labour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya government is preparing a
national policy on child labour focusing on education system,
safety nets and measures towards eradication of poverty, said the
country's Minister of Labor Joseph Ngutu.
</P>
<P>
Ngutu made the statement here Thursday at a symposium on child
labour and the new International Labour Organization Convention,
the Daily Nation reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Child labour was largely a manifestation of poverty, he said,
calling for joint efforts to tackle the problem of poverty in the
east African country.
</P>
<P>
There are about three million children aged between six and 14
in the country who do not attend schools, participants said at
the symposium.
</P>
<P>
Many of them are school drop-outs and teenage single mothers
working with their families or alone in environments dangerous to
their development and physical well-being.
</P>
<P>
At the symposium, Joseph Mugalla, Secretary General of Kenya's
Central Organization of Trade Unions, said that the world now
focused on intolerable forms of child labour, which would soon be
subjected to new conventions to be discussed at the International
Labour Conference in Geneva in June.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was organized by the African Network for the
Prevention of Abuse and Neglect.
</P>
<P>
At the discussions, the network's regional chairperson,
Philista Onyango, called for greater public awareness over the
issue of child labour.
</P>
<P>
A survey carried out by the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) in
13 districts in Kenya last year revealed that 75 percent of
families who live under the poverty line lack the capacity to
provide or protect their children.
</P>
<P>
The 50 percent of Kenya's population living under the poverty
line has greatly contributed to higher reliance on children to
earn for their families through any means of labour, said Crispin
Wilson, UNICEF country office representative.

<P>
LAGOS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian head of state General Sani
Abacha has decried the European Union's rigid opposition to his
regime.
</P>
<P>
He described the actions of some EU countries as regrettable
and constituting acceptable interference in the internal affairs
of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Abacha made the remarks in the capital Abuja Thursday while
presenting letter of credence to eight newly appointed
ambassadors to European countries.
</P>
<P>
Abacha said Nigeria has always maintained the principle of
non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign nations.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government would continue the use of dialogue
rather than confrontation in its dealings with other countries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Abacha regretted that one or two EU member countries chose to
be "unjustifiably hostile towards Nigeria", leading to strained
relations between Nigeria and EU.
</P>
<P>
He urged the envoys to paint an accurate picture of events in
Nigeria in their countries of accreditation.
</P>
<P>
"With the conclusion of the National Assembly elections last
Saturday, the successful implementation of the entire transition
to democratic rule program of our country is now assured," Abacha
said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Coffee, Cashew Exports Threatened by Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's 1998 export target is doomed
as the production of coffee and cashew nuts, two of its main
export items, is being threatened by drought.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged dry season in southern and central Vietnam, as
reported by the latest issue of the Vietnam Investment Review, was
the result of the abnormally warm ocean current known as El Nino.
</P>
<P>
The coffee yield would be down by 10 percent from last year's
figure even if there was rain in the near future, Doan Trieu Nhan,
president of the Vietnam Coffee Association, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
As the world's second largest robust coffee exporter in 1997,
Vietnam is expected to produce 380,000-400,000 metric tons of
coffee this year, but lately revised the figure to 300,000-320,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
The drought could also cut Vietnam's cashew yield by up to 40
percent, said Nguyen Thai Hoc, president of the Vietnam Cashew
Association, adding the 200,000-ton output target this year was no
longer possible.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Gore Express Cautious Optimism About </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and visiting United States Vice-President Al Gore
expressed here Friday cautious optimism about the May 4 London
talks on breaking the Israeli-Palestinian peace deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Gore, who was invited here to attend the jubilee
celebration marking Israel's 50th anniversary, Friday held
extensive and far-reaching discussions on bilateral relations, the
peace process and Russia's cooperation with Iran in developing
non-conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
But Gore stressed that he was not negotiating with Netanyahu on
the percentage of the controversial Israeli second redeployment in
the West Bank, but to "minimize potential misunderstandings."
</P>
<P>
"We have done our best to facilitate progress in the
negotiations among the parties themselves. We have high hopes
that the process will yield true peace with security. And we
also believe that London offers the occasion for great
progress, and we hope and pray that progress will occur," he
told the joint news conference with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
During the London talks, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright will hold separate meetings with Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a bid to break the year-old
deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Before Gore's arrival here Thursday, U.S. special peace envoy
Dennis Ross had already been in the region for a week launching
intensive efforts to bridge the gap between the Israelis and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ross tried to persuade Israel to accept the U.S. plan calling
for a 13.1 percent withdrawal in the second redeployment in the
West Bank. Arafat has publicly accepted the compromise plan, but
Netanyahu is reluctant to soften his rejection to the
plan. Netanyahu claimed that any pullback over 9 percent could
seriously endanger Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he was realistically optimistic about the
outcome of London talks, but adding that the Palestinians must
also make concessions in order to sign an agreement in London.
</P>
<P>
"But if the Palestinians come with fixed position and say 'we
will not budge, only Israel should budge,' and that budging on our
side is compromises on our security, I would say that's not the
recipe for success," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gore also said that he and Netanyahu discussed the alleged
Russia's continued cooperation with Iran in developing
non-conventional weapons. Israel views Iran as its No.1 military
threat to its existence, and has been trying hard to stop Russia
from helping Iran develop long-range missiles and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the strong strategic relationship between Israel
and the U.S., saying Washington will provide iron-clad guarantee
for Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
Gore expressed the hope that progress could be made on the
Russian-Iranian military cooperation because of the establishment
of a new reformist government in Russia led by new Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko. He disclosed that he and Kiriyenko had
maintained close contacts through phone conversations.
</P>
<P>
He did not say that if the U.S. would apply sanctions on
Russia if Moscow continues its military cooperation with
Iran. But he said he would continue intensive efforts to pressure
Russia to cease the cooperation in order to protect Israel's
security.
</P>
<P>
Gore and hundreds of foreign guests attended the gala
celebration ceremony Thursday night in a packed Jerusalem stadium,
that culminated the one-day official celebration with anthem
singing, joyful dancing and colorful fireworks displaying.

<HEADLINE> 2.5 Million S. Africans can'nt Vote in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- About 2.5 million South
African voters do not have the correct identity documents to be
allowed to vote in next year's elections, local media reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Launching a campaign to make people aware of the need to be in
possession of the new green ID book issued after 1986, Home
Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi said that over 10 percent
of the country's current 24 million permanent residents do not
have the new documents.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) said Wednesday that
voters must register in an electoral district with the new green
ID books for the 1999 elections. This is different from the 1994
elections, when whoever had permanent residence status was
allowed to vote.
</P>
<P>
The IEC said a lot of problems would be eliminated if the new
ID books, with bar-codes that could be read by electronic scanner,
were used.
</P>
<P>
IEC Chairman Johann Kreigler said the commission had to get a
common national identity document to use in voter registration.
He said documents issued before 1986 and homeland identity
documents are not sufficiently reliable.
</P>
<P>
The estimated 2.5 million people who don't have the new ID
books include not only many older white people, but also rural
residents who did not have valid ID documents.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi called on people to apply as soon as possible for
the new ID books to ensure that they would be allowed to register
as voters by the end of this year, so as to avoid an application
rush for identity documents immediately prior to the elections.
</P>
<P>
The ministry had budgeted 23 million Rand (4.6 million U.S.
Dollars) to facilitate the process, including appointing
temporary staff, buying additional supplies and paying their
staff overtime. Endit

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Combats Export Fallout from Asian Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Local authorities in Shenzhen
are closely monitoring the gradually decreasing foreign trade
because of the negative effects of the Southeast Asia financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The foreign trade volume in March was down 14.2 percent
compared with the year-ago period, the lowest in the past 13
months despite the fact that exports gained by 16.3 percent in the
first three months as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, the first special economic zone in China, exported
25.5 billion U.S. dollars in goods last year, accounting for
one-seventh of the country's total export.
</P>
<P>
However, in the first quarter of this year, the city only
fulfilled one-fifth of the yearly quota under the national plan.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the financial turmoil has
increased competition among local exporters in Shenzhen as prices
have plummeted. They fear that it will be even harder for local
exporters in the latter half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Some local analysts say there are positive factors for local
exporters, such as its well-structured and healthy economy,
rapidly developing high-tech industries, cheap labor, pluralistic
market strategy, and the economic and social stability that is
attractive to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Authorities plan to take reform measures to boost its export
sector, including setting up joint venture foreign trade
companies, improving the structure of export goods and supporting
local foreign traders by making better use of the tax-refund
policy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts will also be made to explore new markets in
the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Latin America and Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Most members of the Asian Development
Bank's (ADB) Board of Governors are expecting to see recovery, by
some countries, from the Asian financial crisis next year.
</P>
<P>
ADB President Mitsuo Sato said, at the closing of the 31st
annual ADB board meeting here Friday, that the recovery is
expected as the crisis-affected countries' bold reforms bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
"These economies are expected to begin recovery in 1999," Sato
said, adding that their sustained growth is likely to resume "over
the medium-term on an even more solid ground than in the past."
</P>
<P>
Despite the region's difficulties for the moment, the governors
said many of the economic fundamentals that propelled Asia's
remarkable achievements in the past three decades remain intact.
</P>
<P>
The governors, however, said this is no time for complacency
and continued close monitoring of the situation is essential.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day board meeting from April 29 to May 1, the
governors reviewed economic and policy developments of the
Asia-Pacific region and assessed the ADB's performance.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Government to Upgrade Workers' Skills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Government said on
Friday that it will contribute 50 million Singapore dollars (about
32 million U.S. dollars) to expand the Skills Redevelopment
Program in order to upgrade the skills of the workers, who are
facing possible retrenchment as the country's economy underwent
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to help 20,000 workers get certified technical
skills over the next year, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said at a
May Day Rally, marking the International Labors' Day.
</P>
<P>
He said if the program is successful, the government will
contribute an additional 50 million Singapore dollars. The
Manpower Ministry will oversee the program's expansion, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said that Singapore should use this period
of economic slowdown to consolidate its strengths and increase
investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
In order to do so, he said, one key area to focus on was
manpower resource as the quality of the country's workforce would
determine the winners in the economic race.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the workers here must acquire the basic skills and
the capacity to learn so that they would stay employable
throughout their working lives, Goh urged.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister also announced that the government will
contribute up to 9 million Singapore dollars (about 5.7 million
U.S. dollars) to the NTUC (National Trade Union Congress)
Education and Training fund which allows workers to take up
part-time programs on their own.

<HEADLINE> Animal Husbandry Sector in China Faces Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- China's animal husbandry sector
maintained growth during the first quarter of this year, but it
faces the possibility of a downturn in development, the People's
Daily has reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the sector's continued growth to the
production inertia witnessed last year and said the current rising
price for corn and comparatively bleak market demand for animal
products will overshadow this year's development of animal
husbandry.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 corn output fell by a wide margin and pushed prices
higher. Last year's good profit levels for pigs also increased the
demand for corn, a major forage crop.
</P>
<P>
Forage prices account for 70 percent of the cost for stock
breeding.
</P>
<P>
However, prices for pigs have continued to fall since
September, with March statistics showing an 11 percent fall in
prices for live pigs and an eight percent drop in the price of
pork when compared to the previous year's period.
</P>
<P>
Low prices were also recorded for eggs and other animal husbandry
products such as beef and mutton.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper suggested the government guide consumption
towards beef and mutton, and noted that the output of the products
is lower than the worldwide average.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief to Visit Uganda Next Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan will visit Uganda on May 8, the New Vision newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
But it did not reveal Annan's agenda in Uganda, the seventh
leg of his eight-nation African tour.
</P>
<P>
Babatunde Thomas, who coordinates U.N. activities in Uganda,
said: ''We shall soon issue a detailed program of his activities
in Uganda.''
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials said the civil wars in Rwanda and Somalia will
dominate many of Annan's discussions.
</P>
<P>
Despite his tight schedule, Annan is expected to seek
reactions to his recent major report on Africa that included
tough proposals to stop wars and economic deterioration and to
put an end to illegal arms trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Starting from Ethiopia, Annan, the first U.N. chief from
Sub-Sahara Africa, is scheduled to travel to Djibouti, Kenya,
Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda and Eritrea before returning to
New York on May 10.
</P>
<P>
The aim of his visit is to forge relations with leaders at a
time when the world body is striving to raise its often-frayed
image on the continent.
</P>
<P>
This is Annan's first visit to east and central Africa as
secretary-general.

<HEADLINE> Temporary Shiplock on Three Gorges Dam into Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The temporary shiplcok on the Three
Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, opened to navigation at 10:00
this morning.
</P>
<P>
As the first major and comprehensive project after the Yangtze
River was dammed last November, the shiplock, together with a
water diversion channel, will be in use for the next six years.
</P>
<P>
The shiplock on the left bank of the Yangtze River will serve
as a pass for 3,000-dwt vessels.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the shiplock will only be used for
shipping when the water flow exceeds 10,000 cubic meters per
second, which occurs usually in flood seasons. Under normal
circumstances, the diversion channel will be used for the same
purpose.
</P>
<P>
At an inauguration ceremony for the operation of the shiplock
this morning, a ship passed the shiplock in about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
However, an official in charge of the construction of the
shiplock said that it will take about 45 minutes for more
than one ship to pass the shiplock simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
It took five years to build the shiplock at a cost 1.5 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
A permanent shiplock, the world's largest, will be in operation
by the year 2003.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Stronger Close to Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A short-covering squeeze higher as
traders squared up ahead of the weekend inspired the Australian
dollar to close well above 65.00 U.S. cents Friday.
</P>
<P>
The unit ended the local session at 65.34 U.S. cents, from
65.22 late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
St George bank manager of foreign exchange trading Stuart Moore
said the rally pushed the currency as high as 65.45 U.S. cents
before it retreated.
</P>
<P>
Moore said it was a strong finish for the local unit
considering the substantially weaker gold price and the softness
of the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
Gold in Sydney Friday was trading at 306.45 U.S. dollars per
fine ounce, from 311.65 at the previous local close.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, Moore said the foreign exchange market will
spend next week digesting a raft of domestic data.
</P>
<P>
"All eyes will be on the data, with rate cuts off the agenda
for the moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Reserve Bank of Australia governor Ian Macfarlane
will give his semi-annual statement on monetary policy and the
Bureau of Statistics releases labor force data.
</P>
<P>
Also of note for the foreign exchange market will be an
expected decision on Monday from the High Court on the waterfront
dispute.
</P>
<P>
The High Court is expected to announce its decision on whether
to allow the appeal by Patrick stevedores against a court order
requiring it to reinstate its 1,400 sacked workers at 11.30 a.m.
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar closed at 86.89 from
85.99 against the Japanese yen, and at 1.1710 from 1.1685 against
the Deutsche mark.

<HEADLINE> Liquefied Chemicals Berth Open to Overseas Customers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A 50,000-dwt liquefied chemicals
berth in Ningbo Port in east China's Zhejiang Province recently
received approval to open to foreign customers.
</P>
<P>
Port experts say that the move will enable Ningbo Port to be a
world-class liquefied chemical products facility on a par with
Pusan in the Republic of Korea, Singapore Port, and Rotterdam in
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The berth, one of the largest in inland China, is 349 meters
long and has an average depth of 14 meters. The berth has an
annual cargo handling capacity of two million tons and is
connected to a pipeline network running to two nearby liquefied
chemical berths.
</P>
<P>
The berth has received 13 large liquefied chemical tankers
since it started trial operation in April last year, according to
the Ningbo Port Administration.
</P>
<P>
The trial operation has ignited an investment craze in the
Zhenhai Area, where the new berth is. The area now boasts 106
liquefied chemical tanks operated by eight foreign-funded
ventures. The said tanks have a total storage capacity of 200,000
cubic meters. New liquefied chemical storage tanks with a
total capacity of 90,000 cu.m. are scheduled to enter operations
in August.
</P>
<P>
Ningbo Port handled more than 500,000 tons of liquefied
chemicals in 1997, and has led the nation's ports in total volume
for three consecutive years.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Tan Anzhou, former chief prosecutor
in northeast China's Liaoning Province has been sentenced to six
years confinement for attempting to use his brother as scapegoat
to cover-up the fact of a traffic accident which killed two
pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred on the evening of November 29, 1997,
after Tan Anzhou, then serving as chief prosecutor, and three
other officials in Heishan County of Jinzhou City departed a local
dance hall under the influence of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
Tan was faced with losing his powerful post and persuaded his
younger brother to act as scapegoat. However, Tan's
sister-in-law voiced strong objections to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Jinzhou People's Congress and Discipline Inspection
Department jointly investigated the case after receiving
eye-witness reports.
</P>

Tan finally realized the futility of the attempted cover-up and
surrendered to the local public security bureau on December
14, 1997.

prosecuted.

<HEADLINE> Small County Becomes Major Exporter of Winter Vegetables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Tianyang County of south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is little-known nationally, but
to winter vegetable buyers it is a gold mine.
</P>
<P>
During last winter and this spring, the county in western
Guangxi sold 280,000 tons of vegetables to 55 major Chinese cities
and to Russia and Vietnam, with the sale to Russia topping an
impressive 10,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The exports have brought the county more than 290 million yuan
(34.93 million U.S. dollars) in income, which means a lot to the
county since part of its population still lives below the national
poverty line.
</P>
<P>
A favorable sub-tropical climate and good government policies
have enabled the county to become a major winter vegetable
exporter.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the growing and sales of vegetables, "hot lines"
have been set up in the offices and homes of the county
magistrate. Goal of the hot lines is to resolve transportation and
marketing service problems.
</P>
<P>
At present, the county grows 10,133 hectares of winter
vegetables, with the output last winter and this spring reaching
300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Vegetable-growing has also triggered new jobs in packaging,
transportation and catering.

<HEADLINE> African Ports Urged to Go Fully Commercial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A workshop held in Kenya's
southern port city Mombasa has urged African ports to become
fully commercialized in order to respond to demands of
their respective economies.
</P>
<P>
At the workshop on commercialization of African ports held in
Mombasa earlier this week, Stanley Murage, Permanent
Secretary of Kenya's Ministry for Transport and Communication,
said that time had come for African ports to go commercial, the
Kenya Times reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It is high time that ports are guided in their operations by
commercial undertakings rather than socio-political needs that
has for long guided them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Ports Authority Managing Director Lenny Mwangola
told the three-day workshop that most African ports were unable
to realize a dream of competing effectively in international
market due to rigid policies brought about by state controlled
nature.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was attended by officials from the U.N. Economic
Commission for Africa (UNECA), Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and the Port Management
Association for Eastern and Southern Africa (PMAESA).
</P>
<P>
UNECA Executive Secretary K. Amaoko said at the workshop that
African ports were far from responding to demands of their
respective economies due to their state-controlled operational
systems.
</P>
<P>
The trend had made these ports to be obstacles to full
integration of respective economies due to excessive
bureaucracies, operational sluggishness, inappropriate technology
and vested interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Amaoko, UNECA has already recognized that African
ports were faced with major institutional problems, one of which
is the interface between government ministries and ports
organizations.
</P>
<P>
UNECA presented at the workshop a paper on an overview of port
commercialization activities in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Delegation Leaves for Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The five-member delegation of the
Taliban militia attending the intra-Afghan peace talks left here
for Afghanistan Friday morning on a special U.N. plane.
</P>
<P>
The current round of intra-Afghan peace talks between the
Taliban and the rival Northern Alliance ran into deadlock Thursday
night due to the divergence of opinions of the two sides on issues
relating to lifting the blockade of humanitarian aid to central
Afghanistan, ceasefire and exchange of POWs.
</P>
<P>
James Ngobi, Acting Chief of the U.N. Peace Mission on
Afghanistan, told reporters late Thursday night after the
conclusion of the fifth day talks that the Steering Committee
decided to make a short break so as to allow the Taliban
delegation to go back and "engage in further consultations with
their leadership."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the two Afghan warring factions will resume
their peace talks here on May 3 as soon as the Taliban delegation
returns.
</P>
<P>
The two sides in their earlier talks had already reached an
agreement relating to the formation of the proposed Ulema
(religious scholars) Commission.
</P>
<P>
The current round of intra-Afghan peace talks began here on
April 26. The talks, cosponsored by the U.N. and the Organization
of Islamic Conference, is the first face-to-face meeting between
the Taliban and the Northern Alliance in more than a year.

<HEADLINE> hke050122 -Ramos Predicts Modest Growth in Philippines This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
predicted here Friday that his country will post a modest growth
rate of at least 3 percent this year despite the on-going
financial crisis in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the bold prediction at a meeting in celebration of
the Labor Day with various labor groups in the University of the
Philippines in Manila.
</P>
<P>
He said that the continued flow of foreign investments to the
country and a robust economy are a clear manifestation that the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) will achieve a moderate
growth of 3 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the projected negative growth rates for some of
our neighbors in 1998 and 1999, our economy is still expected to
grow by at least 3 percent for this year," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
In an economic outlook released last month, the Asian
Development Bank predicted that Southeast Asian countries will see
a negative growth rate of 0.4 percent this year due to the
10-month-old financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the Philippines' GDP will expand by 2.4
percent this year, while Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea will
see a negative growth.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that the resiliency of the Filipinos in time of
crisis will enable the country to overcome any problems.
</P>
<P>
As long as the Filipinos have "unity, solidarity and team," the
country will survive the current turmoil, he said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Likely to Adopt Licensing System in Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
contemplating a comprehensive licensing system in the telecom
sector for its efficient and effective operation, an independent
news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed system, licenses will be issued to those who
are qualified as per the set criteria through bidding or open
tender or other procedures set by the government, the United News
of Bangladesh (UNB) said.
</P>
<P>
The system will be developed by a separate autonomous
regulatory commission to be set up for issuing operator license
for the telecom sector as well as to monitor them.
</P>
<P>
The commission, under the Ministry of Post and
Telecommunications, will be formed by an act in the parliament,
according to the newly approved national telecom policy (1998).
</P>
<P>
The autonomous body will be "transparent" in all its activities
to the operators, interested parties engaged in telecom,
government agencies and people in general.
</P>
<P>
It will also ensure equity and fair play by providing a level
playing field for all operators.
</P>
<P>
At present, eight operators are in operation or licensed to
develop and operate telecom services in the country, UNB said.
</P>
<P>
The commission will be responsible for the supervision of the
telecom services to ensure that users' interests are protected.
</P>
<P>
It will define the mechanism in which the views of the
operators and the service users could be periodically obtained. It
will also set the standards, qualifications and number of
personnel in each category for all operators based on their
services. The standards will be binding on all operators, and
failure to meet these standards will attract penal action by the
commission. A network management cell will also be created.
</P>
<P>
In case of any dispute on interconnection and revenue sharing
between any parties, the commission will consider it through
hearing and its decision shall be final though they may appeal to
the government.
</P>
<P>
The members of the commission will be appointed among people in
and outside the government services, including retired officials
with backgrounds of telecom, finance, law and management.

ISLAMABAD, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Pakistani English newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The News:
</P>
<P>
-- The demand by the Northern Alliance for lifting of road
blockades caused the rival Afghan factions to postpone the
Islamabad peace talks for two days Thursday but they pledged to
return Sunday after consulting their leaders.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hails Senate Approval of NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate on Thursday
night approved the membership of Hungary, Poland and the Czech
Republic in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and
President Bill Clinton welcomed the outcome.
</P>
<P>
After a long and fierce debate, the Senate voted 80 to 19 to
approve the protocol on the expansion of the alliance, which was
created in 1949 as a counter to the former Soviet Bloc.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the vote, which was strongly supported by both
Republicans and Democrats, was "a major milestone on the road to
an undivided democratic and peaceful Europe".
</P>
<P>
"The message this vote sends is clear. American support for
NATO is firm; our leadership for security on both sides of the
Atlantic is strong and there is a solid bipartisan foundation for
an active U.S. role in the world," Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released in Washington, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, currently visiting China, also hailed the vote
as "a moment of injustice undone, of promises kept, and of a
unified Europe begun".
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is the fifth country of the 16-member NATO to ratify
the protocol following Canada, Denmark, Germany and Norway. It
needs the approval of all signatory states plus the three new
members.
</P>
<P>
The approval came after the Senate rejected a series of
measures earlier on Thursday to block or slow NATO expansion into
the former Soviet Bloc.
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted 59-41 against a proposal by Senator John
Warner to allow for a three-year moratorium beyond Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Warner, a leading opponent of the NATO enlargement, called the
three-year pause "a reasonable period of time" that would leave
the decision on future expansion to the next U.S. president and
the Congress elected in 2000.
</P>
<P>
But critics of Warner's amendment said it would work against
the spirit of opening NATO to the new democracies of central and
eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
"This is what we fought the Cold War for," said Senator John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton and Senate leaders were all confident
that the alliance's expansion will be ratified. However, a half
dozen amendments were still pending late in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Senate also rejected by 83-17 a proposal by
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan to bar NATO membership to nations
that are not first members of the 15-member European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Senate also rejected an amendment which requires Clinton to
get specific approval from Congress to keep U.S. troops in Bosnia,
or bring them home, before the NATO expansion could proceed.
</P>
<P>
The NATO's eastward expansion was called by the Clinton
administration as a natural next step after the Cold War. But
opponents complained about potential hidden costs, saying it would
further isolate Russia and lead to more entangling military
commitments.

<HEADLINE> Italy Calls for Dialogue to End Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government hopes
Yugoslavia and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo will enter negotiations
as suggested by the Contact Group to end the crisis there, Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dini made the remark when briefing the cabinet on Wednesday's
meeting of the six-nation Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the group members -- Britain, France, Germany,
Italy, Russia and the United States -- announced a package of
"incentives and deterrents" to push Belgrade and Pristina to open
dialogue between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Among the incentives was the full reintegration of Yugoslavia
into international organizations. The deterrents included a freeze
on Serbia's and the Yugoslav Federation's foreign assets -- a
measure proposed at the Contact Group's meeting in London last
month.
</P>
<P>
Dini said the mixture of incentives and deterrents agreed to by
the Contact Group was designed to help cope with emerging dangers
in Kosovo and avoid any enlargement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed a "positive balance" for the meeting because it
managed to maintain the Contact Group's cohesion and identify a
path along which the crisis could be gradually overcome.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a Serbian province with an ethnic Albanian
majority. Conflicts between Serb police and ethnic Albanians have
reportedly killed at least 80 people since last February.

<HEADLINE> US Senate Approves NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate has approved
the membership of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) after a long and fierce
debate.
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted 80 to 19 to approve the protocol on the
expansion.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is the fifth country of the 16-member NATO alliance
to ratify the protocol, following Canada, Denmark, Germany and
Norway. The membership needs the approval of all the members plus
the three new members.
</P>
<P>
The approval came after the Senate rejected a series of
measures earlier on Thursday to block or slow the NATO's expansion
into the former Soviet bloc.
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted 59-41 against a proposal by Senator John
Warner that will allow for a three-year moratorium beyond Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Warner, a leading opponent of expanding NATO, called the
three-year pause "a reasonable period of time" that would leave
the decision on future expansion to the next U.S. president and
Congress elected in 2000.
</P>
<P>
But critics of Warner's amendment said it would work against
the spirit of opening NATO to the new democracies of central and
eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
"This is what we fought the Cold War for," said Senator John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton and Senate leaders are all confident
that the alliance's expansion will be ratified. However, a half
dozen amendments were still pending late in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Senate also rejected by a vote of 83-17 a proposal
by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan to bar NATO membership to
nations that are not first members of the 15-member European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Senate also rejected an amendment by Sen. Larry Craig
(R. Idaho), that would have required Clinton to get specific
approval from Congress to keep U.S. troops in Bosnia, or bring
them home, before the NATO expansion could proceed.
</P>
<P>
The alliance's expansion was backed by the Clinton
administration as the natural next step after the end of the Cold
War. But opponents complained about potential hidden costs, saying
it would further isolate Russia and lead to more entangling
military commitments.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Raises Civil Servants' Salaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- From May 1, Indonesia's civil
servants will receive a 15-percent pay increase, a senior official
announced.
</P>
<P>
When making the announcement here Thursday night, Coordinating
Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita
said this did not match inflation which jumped more than 25
percent in the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
"But it's all we can do," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister also confirmed that fuel and electricity prices
will rise in May and early June.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia will abide by its understanding with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) that the fuel and electricity
prices will be adjusted in the month of May and early June," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that increasing those rates is a "very high political
risk at present time when you have social unrest".
</P>
<P>
But, Ginandjar said, it "will show the market we are determined
to repair our economy and stop the bleeding through (government)
subsidies".
</P>
<P>
He also said that all subsidies would be abolished by October 1
under a reform agreement with the IMF except for those on rice and
soybeans.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia signed an agreement with the IMF in October last year
for conducting economic and financial reforms in exchange for an
IMF-led bailout package aid of 43 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President Calls for Discussions Instead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Friday called for discussions instead of strikes to
settle issues.
</P>
<P>
In her May Day message to the nation, she appealed to all to
eschew thought of petty sectarian political advantage and march in
a united way to safeguard the nation.
</P>
<P>
She said, "If in this difficult journey all working people led
by the working class play the leading role and become path-finders
to others, reaching our goal will be rendered a great deal
easier."
</P>
<P>
The president reminded those resorting to hasty and
indiscriminate strike action that it is not a wise strategy and
said that discussion to solve problems is the better way.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said that the greatest challenge that lays before
the nation was the ending of the ethnic war and restoring peace
and uniting the broken disunited nation while creating a
prosperous society.
</P>
<P>
"May Day signifies both unity and dynamism to win just rights.
We struggle today against cruel and terrible terrorism to create a
prosperous society and to unify the fractured nation," she added.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said, "Those resorting readily, hastily and
indiscriminately to strike action to find solutions to problems,
making undue use of the democratic atmosphere created by us
braving numerous hardships, repressions and challenges to the risk
of our very lives will certainly be no wise strategy."
</P>
<P>
She said that resorting to discussion to solve problems was the
better method under most circumstances and it is a salient feature
of the democratic way.
</P>
<P>
She urged everyone to believe and follow this strategy to solve
problems.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government declared posts and telecommunications
essential service last Friday in a bid to end a prolonged overtime
boycott by postal workers who launched a 44-day strike which has
severely affected the country's economy and administration.
</P>
<P>
However, the postal dispute took a turn for the worse Thursday
with workers deciding to stage a sit-down strike.

<HEADLINE> Half of Indonesia's State Firms Unhealthy: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- At least 50 percent of the 164 state
companies in Indonesia are unhealthy, a senior government official
said.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki Usman, secretary to the state minister of the
empowerment of state enterprises, said here Thursday that based on
half-yearly reports, 78 of the 164 state companies were in poor
financial condition last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of ailing companies would have increased this year
as a result of the severe impact of the economic crisis on their
activities, the Jakarta Post Friday quoted Marzuki as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I think the number of unhealthy state corporations will
continue to increase due to the crisis," he said at a seminar.
</P>
<P>
The combined assets of Indonesia's 164 state-owned firms were
worth 461.6 trillion rupiah (57.7 billion U.S. dollars) at the end
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki declined to name the unhealthy corporations. He said
the 70- percent fall in the value of the rupiah against the U.S.
dollar since July last year had affected almost all state
companies.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah touched its lowest level of 17,000 to the dollar in
January this year, but has recently remained moderately stable,
trading at around 8,000 per dollar for a number of weeks.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki said the newly established Office of State Minister of
the Empowerment of State Enterprises would concentrate on
privatizing certain state corporations, as agreed with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) early last month.
</P>
<P>
The government has identified seven state firms to be
privatized during this financial year and five other listed
companies in which the government will reduce its stake.
</P>
<P>
The government predicted to raise around 15 trillion rupiah
(1.87 billion U.S. dollars) from the sell-off.

BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A powerful explosion in a chemical
plant in Shijiazhuang, capital of north China's Hebei province,
has killed at least six workers and caused an estimated loss of
over ten million yuan, China's Youth Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
A lab, which was the key research body of the plant,
exploded at about 9:20 am on Tuesday, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"The earth shaking at that time made me thought that an
earthquake is occurring," said a neighboring grocery runner.
"After I called the 110 police emergency, I saw the four-story
building of the plant was covered by fire and smoke," the paper
quoted a witness as saying.
</P>
<P>
Local fire brigades and relief teams immediately arrived at the
site. Fire brigades spent more than two hours on putting out the
conflagration after the explosion, the witness said.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the explosion also injured five workers, who
are now in stable condition in hospital.
</P>
<P>
The lab was trying to produce a kind of surface-active agent
with the experiment equipment imported from France. An
reactor on the building's second floor might cause the
explosion, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Awards Boeing Contract on Missile Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States Defense
Department on Thursday awarded a research and development contract
to Seattle's Boeing Co. to coordinate a missile-defense system,
Defense Secretary William Cohen announced.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1.6 billion dollar contract, Boeing will design,
develop, test and integrate a variety of components for a
space-age "National Missile Defense" (NMD) to guard the nation
against ballistic missile attack.
</P>
<P>
During the research, Boeing will design a system of
ground-based interceptor missiles and space-based satellites for
missile launch detection and communications. They will be tied
together with a sophisticated battle management control.
</P>
<P>
If the system works, the Pentagon could make a decision to
deploy it in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said the value of the contract could eventually
reach 5.2 billion dollars if the system works and moves towards
deployment.
</P>
<P>
The NMD, emerging from former U.S. president Ronald Reagan's
"Star Wars" program, is to stop a smaller or accidental attack by
another country against the United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States has spent billions of dollars on nuclear
missile defense since Reagan put up his plan more than a decade
ago, but little success has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military is also trying to develop an even more
limited Theater Missile Defense (TMD) program to protect troops
and bases from missile attack around the world. But that program
has experienced four successive failures.
</P>
<P>
However, Cohen said the United States was making "great
progress" towards solving the technological problems involved in
producing a national missile defense system.

<P>
BANGKOK, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime Minister Hun
Sen's two-day visit to Thailand, which begins next Wednesday, is
expected to strengthen the country's social, political and
economic cooperation with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen and Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai will held talks
on the first day of Hun Sen's visit, according to Thai Foreign
Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will discuss a wide range of issues including the
overlapping maritime claims in the Gulf of Thailand, land boundary
demarcation, demining, Thai investment in Cambodia, promotion of
border trade, return of thousands of Cambodians, technical
cooperation and efforts to promote peace and security along the
border, Kobsak was quoted Friday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Cambodia will sign two agreements on anti-drug
trafficking and prisoner extradition during Hun Sen's visit, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's national elections in July will be also included on
the agenda of the Chuan-Hun Sen meeting, Kobsak said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand treats Cambodian elections as the country's internal
affair, but would support the polls to take place on July 26 as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting in Bangkok on April 19, Thailand, Indonesia and
the Philippines, in lieu of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations and the Friends of Cambodia called for the elections to be
organized on July 26.

<HEADLINE> Hangzhou Starts to Build Software Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A software industrial park is under
construction in Hangzhou, capital of East China's Zhejiang
Province,
</P>
<P>
Located in Hangzhou High-Technology Industry Development Zone
(HHTZ), the software park marks the city's effort to promote
knowledge-based economy centered on the information technology
industry.
</P>
<P>
The software park will become an important base in the
research, development and production of computer software and its
related products in Zhejiang, said Shi Juwu, vice-mayor of
Hangzhou City.
</P>
<P>
He said there are 16 universities and institutions, more than
20 research organizations and some 600 high-tech enterprises in
the development zone.
</P>
<P>
Shi, also the director of the HHTZ, said that the
13-square-kilometer park has an advantage over many other places
of the country to develop the software industry.
</P>
<P>
The Administration Committee of the HHTZ has allocated 26
million yuan (3.1 million US dollars) for initial investment, of
which 19 million yuan (2.3 million US dollars) will be used for
industrial housing and other infrastructural construction.
</P>
<P>
An industrial housing project covering 21,000 square meters is
close to completion and will open in the HHTZ in October, China
Daily has reported.
</P>
<P>
The park will turn into a large-scale State-level software
industrial base that will be home to 10 to 15 software enterprises
within five years.
</P>
<P>
The HHTZ is preparing to set up a working station for overseas
students majoring in software as the first move to attract
talents.

<P>
ROME, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Thursday reiterated Russia's objection exerting pressure on the
Yugoslav government over the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a long telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi, Yeltsin said the international community should not
press Yugoslavia to come to terms with the ethnic Albanians in the
troubled Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president said it is "unacceptable" to freeze
Yugoslavia's foreign assets and threaten a freeze on its foreign
investments.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said here that Yeltsin and Prodi also
exchanged views on bilateral cooperation, the forthcoming visit to
Russia by Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, and other world
issues.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders stressed the need to move ahead "without delay"
in applying those agreements reached during Yeltsin's February
visit to Rome, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's February trip to Italy witnessed the signing of an
important bilateral Plan of Action which called for boosting
cooperation between the two countries in all fields, especially in
economies.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sets up One-Stop Service for Bank Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has set up
a coordinating team, dubbed a one-stop service, to help accelerate
mergers, consolidations and acquisitions of commercial banks, the
central bank said.
</P>
<P>
"The one-stop service is aimed at reducing bureaucratic
procedures, in time as well as administrative costs, for mergers,
consolidations and acquisitions," a press statement issued
Thursday by Bank Indonesia said.
</P>
<P>
It said the team will start work Friday and run until the end
of the year, although its existence may be extended if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Banking analysts said that the one-stop service should reduce
the paperwork for acquisitions, mergers or consolidations. In the
past, banks planning to merge had to go through various government
departments to get all the approvals required, which was time
consuming.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the one-stop service is only addressing
the administrative work of the process. The hardest part is the
pre-merger phase, they said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in October
last year signed an agreement on economic and financial reforms to
overcome the country's monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has shut 23 of the nation's more than
200 banks since late last year in a bid to improve the efficiency
of the banking system.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Election Jitters May Send Peso Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Election uncertainties have sent the
Philippine currency below 40 pesos to the U.S. dollar this week,
but the currency is unlikely to recover until a clear winner is
proclaimed in the May 11 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
The peso saw its new downturn last Friday when speculative
attacks on the currency started. With the growing concerns that
the forthcoming national and local election may fail in some parts
of the country, the peso plunged further to 40.10 against the
greenback Tuesday, the lowest since mid-March.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso Thursday slid further despite the central
bank's increase of overnight lending rates from 13 percent to 13.5
percent, a move designed to lure dollars back into peso assets and
deposits and reverse the currency's decline. The peso opened at
40.14 against the dollar and closed at 40.20.
</P>
<P>
Currency traders said that the peso's decline could hardly be
reversed when investors are haunted by rumors about
election-related violence and a potential election failure in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The worries have also cowed the stock market. Over the past two
weeks, the Philippine Stock Exchange's main index has declined on
thin volume and shed about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The flows of volatile portfolio investments, or "hot money,"
have slowed down in the past month as offshore fund managers await
the results of the election with bated breath.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the main reasons behind the sustained weakening
of the peso against the dollar from a week ago, apart from
occasional commercial demand by the market, economists here said.
</P>
<P>
"I've been talking to some fund managers and they are not
particularly concerned with who wins. All the major candidates
have said they will continue the (Ramos) government's policies...
but they are just cautious about the process and want to be sure
it is fair and leads to no social unrest," said Mark Boyne, senior
vice-president for treasury and capital market of Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corp.
</P>
<P>
With the withdrawal of Imelda Marcos from the presidential race
 Thursday, 10 candidates will contest the presidential election on
May 11. A vice president, 12 out of the 24 senators, all 256
members of the House of Representatives, 78 provincial governors,
and 1,608 mayors will also be elected that day.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey shows Vice President Joseph Estrada is
leading the race for the presidency. But the markets are worried
about the former movie star's lack of experience in economic
management.
</P>
<P>
So far, all indications point to a relatively orderly election,
but no one can tell if the rumors or reports about large-scale
violence or an election failure will not become true, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
The Commission on Elections Tuesday predicted a failure of
elections in many parts of the country, particularly in Mindanao,
where vote-rigging and violence are expected.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Manolo Gorospe said that such a failure may lead
to a delay in the proclamation of national and local leaders,
including that of the president.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner's prediction caused new anxieties among
Filipinos, although President Fidel Ramos, who was barred from a
second term by the Constitution, promised no election failure in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have also warned of terrorism and massive
election fraud in the elections. In the May 11 elections in 1992,
more than 100 people, including candidates, were killed in the
election-related violence.
</P>
<P>
This year, the situation has proved little better so far. At
least 12 people have already been killed since the election period
started in January.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Estrada said, "If I'm cheated out of victory, I
will go to the hills and fight."
</P>
<P>
But analysts said that even without a surge in violence and
massive ballot-rigging, foreign funds are expected to remain out
of the Philippine financial market for at least two weeks after
the announcement of the winner of the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
As the proclamation of the winner usually takes weeks after the
poll, the Philippine peso and the stock market may not recover
before the end of June, they said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Secretary of State Supports China's Entry into WTO (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright left here today, winding up her China visit, during which
she expressed many times the hope of her country that China enters
the World Trade Organization (WTO) at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Days before Albright's China tour, which started on Wednesday,
Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi
Guangsheng and U.S. Trade Representative Cherelene Barshefsky
discussed China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Since she first came to Beijing to negotiate the resumption of
China's signatory status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) as U.S. vice trade representative in 1995, Barshefsky
has conferred with Chinese officials many times on the issue.
</P>
<P>
This time, the Sino-U.S. talks on China's membership in the
trade group were held just after some progress had been made.
</P>
<P>
China began to apply to return to the GATT in 1986. Until
now, it has concluded bilateral talks with nine of the 36 WTO
members -- New Zealand, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the
Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Turkey, Singapore and
Pakistan. China has also signed agreements with Japan on commodity
trade.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Secretary of State Supports China's Entry into WTO (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the seventh meeting of the WTO China Working Group,
which was concluded recently, China submitted a new package for
lowering tariffs. The package is aimed at fulfilling a commitment
made by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to reduce China's general
tariff level for industrial products to 10 percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The new package demonstrates the Chinese government's sincerity
in carrying out its promise to the world, said Long Yongtu, chief
negotiator of the MOFTEC.
</P>
<P>
He added that this move should promote the negotiation process
for China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 years, a period full of twists and turns, the
Chinese government's resolution to join the WTO has remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have expressed their hope time and again that
the problem of China's entry into the WTO could be solved at
an early date.
</P>
<P>
However, only China's unilateral efforts are not enough for the
solution of the problem.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi, former foreign trade minister and now state councillor,
said that major WTO members should show their flexibility in
solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials said that, to show flexibility, major
negotiation countries should make their demands within the
framework and scope of WTO agreements on a strictly legal
basis. In the meantime, they should also take into consideration
China's economic status as a developing country as well as China's
social and economic capacity.
</P>
<P>
Many countries and insightful people understand that China
needs the WTO, and the WTO needs China.
</P>
<P>
Renato Ruggiero, WTO director-general, said that he and the
the group's leadership would like to make incessant efforts to
promote China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Pierre-Louis Girard, chairman of the WTO China Working Group,
also said the working group should take advantage of the progress
achieved at the group's seventh meeting to successfully conclude
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that, although the United States wants China to
enter the WTO, its internal political struggles get in the way of
concluding the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
They said it is time for major WTO members to take the
responsibility for solving the problem.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Trade Unions More Active in International Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Federation of Trade
Union (ACFTU), China's national trade union organization, is
busily carrying out international exchanges, welcoming the Labor
Day in a more open way.
</P>
<P>
Around May 1, Chinese workers and visiting unionists from
Japan, the United States, Turkmenistan and the International Labor
Organization will hold get-togethers to celebrate the festival,
according to an ACFTU official.
</P>
<P>
The official said, with the deepening of reform and opening-up,
China has become a major member and plays a more important role in
world affairs, and the ACFTU's international exchanges have also
become more active.
</P>
<P>
Friendship between the ACFTU and trade unions from outside
China has been increasingly deepened, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the principle of independence and wide contacts, the
ACFTU upholds the flag of "peace, development and workers' rights
and interests" and actively carries out international activities in
various areas and at different levels.
</P>
<P>
So far, the ACFTU has established cooperative relations with
419 international and regional trade unions in 131 countries and
regions, according to the official. In the past four years, 267
foreign trade union delegations from 126 countries and regions
have visited China, while more than 200 ACFTU delegations have
visited 190 countries.
</P>
<P>
Through international activities, the ACFTU has developed
all-round friendly relations with trade unions in other countries,
strengthened traditional friendship with trade unions in
developing nations, resumeed relations with Western trade unions,
and improved relations with the three major international trade
unions.
</P>
<P>
The ACFTU participated in multilateral events such as the
International Labor Conference, the UN Summit on Social
Development and the 1995 World Conference on Women, through which
the Chinese trade unions learned much from foreign trade unions.
</P>
<P>
To adapt to the socialist market economy, the ACFTU has, over
the past two years, sent abroad more than 400 local and enterprise
unionists to inspect labor relations, labor legislation,
negotiations between employers and employees, social security and
the trade union operation system, and learn from foreign trade unions
how to protect workers' rights and interests under a market economy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ACFTU has held many international symposiums,
including the ones on the Market Economy and Trade Union Work, the
Market Economy and Labor Relations, the Role of Trade Unions in
Employment and Development, and Trade Union Work in
Overseas-Funded Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the ACFTU has sent more than 1,500 workers
to Japan to study tailoring, machinery manufacturing, horticulture,
welding and dyeing.
</P>
<P>
On ACFTU's future plans for international exchanges, the
official said, the organization will continue to increase
exchanges with foreign trade unions and expand areas of
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Cuts Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela has cut its oil
extraction by 274,000 barrels a day since April 1, 37,000 barrels
more than the amount agreed upon by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to shore up the depressed oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Claus Graf, vice president of the state-owned Petroleos de
Venezuela (PDVSA) oil company, said the cut was mainly in heavy
crudes.
</P>
<P>
The additional reduction of 37,000 barrels a day was agreed on
with some U.S. clients with more recent contracts, Graf added.
</P>
<P>
The PDVSA official said the drop in output made the company
remove 17 perforation rigs from operation.
</P>
<P>
Graf said the reduction was designed to boost oil prices
depressed since December, which have already begun to pick up.
</P>
<P>
He said his company had lost some 71.1 million U.S. dollars
since April 1, when the OPEC agreement to reduce oil extraction
took effect.

MEXICO CITY, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Former Costa Rica coach
Valdeir Vieira of Brazil lost a court case he brought against six
directors of the country's soccer federation after they sacked
him at the start of last year, a court official said in San Jose
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Court official Fabian Barrentes said the judge ruled in favour
of the directors during a hearing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vieira, who was fired in January last year, had demanded
250,000 U.S. dollars compensation on the grounds that he had been
dismissed unfairly.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica sweeped through the first stage of their region's
qualifying competition under Vieira.
</P>
<P>
But once he was sacked, the team appeared to lose all
motivation and dropped to underdogs Jamaica in the race for
France.
</P>
<P>
Vieira later led Iran to qualify for the World Cup finals but
was also kicked out by them as well.

Ngobi avoided mentioning the item, which is believed to have
led to the deadlock, only saying "I was allowed to make the short
statement to the press."
</P>
<P>
However, Afghan sources close to the Steering Committee told
Xinhua that the issue of lifting the blockade of humanitarian aid
to central Afghanistan is the main reason which had led to the
stalemate in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
After about four hours of intensive negotiations by the Taliban
and the Northern Alliance Thursday afternoon, U.S. Ambassador to
Pakistan Thomas Simon Jr. and his deputy Allen Eastham rushed to
the venue of the talks to convince the two Afghan warring factions
to continue the talks.
</P>
<P>
Ngobi said that the U.S. ambassador met individually with the
delegates of the two sides Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Thursday afternoon session, which began at 17:00, was the
longest one during the five-day peace talks as the Taliban and the
rival Northern Alliance refused to budge from their respective
positions on a number of issues including lifting of the blockage,
ceasefire and exchange of POWs.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban insisted that they wanted an early formation of the
Ulema (religious scholars) Commission that will discuss all the
issues.
</P>
<P>
However, the Northern Alliance kept sticking to their position
that the present meeting of the Steering Committee should take all
these issues.
</P>
<P>
At about 20:45, the two sides agreed to adjourn the session for
30 minutes apparently to take guidelines from their respective
leaders in Afghanistan. The two sides are keeping their head
offices update during the five-day peace talks.
</P>
<P>
While the delegates from the Taliban and the Northern Alliance
participating in the talks were busy briefing their leaders, the
U.S. ambassador, Pakistan's special envoy on Afghanistan Iftikhar
Murshid and UN. officials held a corner meeting outside the
conference room.
</P>
<P>
However, the details of the meeting were not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
Assistant General Secretary of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) Ibrahim Saleh Bakar who was co-chairing the talks
with Ngobi, had left for Saudi Arabia around 17:00 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bakar said earlier after the conclusion of the morning session
that the progress was "slow" because of the divergence of opinions
on several issues.
</P>
<P>
The morning session was scheduled to be the final meeting of
current round of talks. It was hoped that the two Afghan warring
factions would agree to formation of the Ulema Commission and
other issues raised by the Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban representative in Islamabad, Abdul Hakeem, while
admitting differences, said the Taliban wanted the issues of
ceasefire and exchange of POWs to be taken up by the Ulema
Commission. However, the Northern Alliance did not agree with the
Taliban position.
</P>
<P>
The intra-Afghan peace talks began here on April 26. It is the
first face-to-face meeting between the two Afghan warring factions
in more than a year.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Radios to Play More Domestic Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Canadian radio stations will have
to play more Canadian music starting next year, the Canadian
Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new policy will "increase the level of Canadian content for
popular music selections played each week on Canadian radio
stations to 35 percent, up from the current 30 percent," CRTC said
here in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The content requirement will also be maintained during the
daytime period -- from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. week days, up from the
previous daytime minimum of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Play Canadian music is a key contribution by the radio
industry to the cultural objectives of the Broadcasting Act," said
Francois Bertrand, chairwoman of CRTC, a government regulator of
radio, television and telecommunications industries.
</P>
<P>
"Minimum Canadian requirements in radio regulations have
contributed significantly to the success of Canadian music in
Canada and abroad," Bertrand noted.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that the new content requirement will
lead to even more Canadian music played by radio stations within
the next five years.

<HEADLINE> US Senate Rejects Slowing NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate rejected
measures on Thursday that will block or slow the expansion of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) into the former Soviet
blocs.
</P>
<P>
The Senate, which is expected to vote on the membership of
three invitees later on Thursday, voted 59-41 against the proposal
by Senator John Warner that will allow for a three-year moratorium
beyond Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Warner, a leading opponent of expanding NATO, called the
three-year pause "a reasonable period of time" that would leave
the decision on future expansion to the next U.S. president and
the Congress elected in 2000.
</P>
<P>
But critics of Warner's amendment said it would work against
the spirit of opening NATO to the new democracies of central and
eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
"This is what we fought the Cold War for," said Senator John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton and Senate leaders are all confident
that the alliance's expansion will be ratified. However, a half
dozen amendments were still pending late in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Senate also rejected by a vote of 83-17 a proposal
by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan to bar NATO membership to
nations that are not first members of the 15-member European
Union.
</P>
<P>
The Senate also rejected an amendment by Sen. Larry Craig,
R-Idaho, that would have required Clinton to get specific approval
from Congress to keep U.S. troops in Bosnia, or bring them home,
before the NATO expansion could proceed.
</P>
<P>
The alliance's expansion was called by the Clinton
administration as the natural next step after the end of the Cold
War. But opponents complained about potential hidden costs, said
it would further isolate Russia and lead to more entangling
military commitments.
</P>
<P>
The expansion plan must be ratified by all the 16 NATO members
plus the three new ones. Canada, Denmark, Germany and Norway have
already approved it.

<HEADLINE> U.S., France Agree on Conditions for Sanctions Lift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and French defense
ministers agreed on Thursday that U.N. sanctions on Iraq could
only be lifted after Baghdad has fully complied with U.N.
resolutions on weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no relief for Saddam Hussein until he fully
complies with the resolutions," U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen told a joint conference with French Defense minister Alain
Richard.
</P>
<P>
"He has an affirmative duty to prove that he has done what he
has claimed to have done," he added.
</P>
<P>
Richard said he agreed with his U.S. counterpart, saying some
progress might have been made by the Iraqis to comply with their
obligations, "but there are quite a lot of remaining concerns"
about biological and chemical weapons capacity.
</P>
<P>
Richard said France was determined to maintain cohesion with
the United States as it was "one of the best ways to convince
Saddam Hussein to change and to accept the rules coming from the
United Nations."
</P>
<P>
During their two-hour talks at the Pentagon, the Cohen and
Richard discussed a wide range of issues, including international
peacekeeping in Bosnia, peacekeeping and cooperation in Africa,
and closer bilateral military cooperation in space.

<HEADLINE> Democrats, Republicans Vying in Fund-Raisinging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Democrats have got hefty
campaign bank accounts in congressional districts where incumbents
are not running.
</P>
<P>
A Republican consultant called the situation worrying to the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
In three districts held by retiring Republicans, Democrats
without serious primary opposition already have raised more than
500,000 dollars each, far more than any Republicans vying for the
nomination to run in the November election.
</P>
<P>
This fund-raising prowess has given Democrats a boost as they
try to capture the 11 seats they need to regain a House majority.
</P>
<P>
Democratic political consultant Peter Fenn said, "It shows
which candidates are out there working hardest and which
candidates have their act together. It says these guys are out of
the box, and they've got an operation, and they're doing what they
should be doing."
</P>
<P>
Representative John Linder of Georgia, chairman of the House
Republican Campaign Committee, said he's not worried. "Some of the
seats they're going to win," The Associated Press quoted him as
saying. "Some we're going to win."
</P>
<P>
Linder's campaign committee has raised far more money so far
than its Democratic counterpart -- 43 million dollars between
January 1, 1997, and March 31 of this year, compared to 19 million
dollars for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
But Republican political consultant Craig Shirley argued that
the Democratic fund-raising edge in some of those important "open
seat" districts should catch the eye of Republican strategists.
</P>
<P>
"That's something to be concerned about," Shirley said. "The
party and the candidates better get their act together quick.
Money equals message. If you've got the money, you're able to get
on the air now, hire staff and be able to use that money to raise
additional money."
</P>
<P>
Representative Martin Frost, a Democrat who heads the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said the party began
recruiting candidates after the 1996 election and urged them to
raise money early and often.
</P>
<P>
The open-seat Democrat who has raised the most money has been
doing it since January 1997, Frost said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We emphasized getting candidates in the races early," Frost
said.
</P>
<P>
There are other successful early fund raisers, but Republicans
aren't without their own fund-raising edges in open-seat
districts.

<HEADLINE> US, France Say not to Send NATO Troops to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen and his French counterpart Alain Richard agreed Thursday to
maintain pressure on Belgrade but stressed that they will not send
troops to the border between Albania and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Cohen, Richard said,
"Military action doesn't seem to us to be now the right answer."
</P>
<P>
"We have to find agreed tools between all the allies both to
limit the attempts of extremist or terrorist action in Kosovo and
to deter Serb authorities from resuming violence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano called for a presence of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Albania to prevent
any possible spillover of recent violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
To increase military control in border areas would be
unbalanced, Richard said, adding, "I think we have to support the
Albanian authorities to get more control of their territory."
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with Richard, Cohen said pressure is needed on Serbia
to give Kosovo greater autonomy, he said, without signaling
support for Kosovo independence.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to cooperate and find ways in which we can bring
some stability and help encourage a stabilizing influence in the
region but not with talk of establishing a military line of
protection on the Albanian border," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United States and France will reduce
peacekeeping forces slightly in Bosnia this summer, while
increasing commitments to build stability.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also said that France is increasing its commitment to an
international police force from 120 to 200.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question, Cohen said the United States has no
immediate plans to reduce forces in the Persian Gulf. "We expect
to maintain our current level for at least the foreseeable
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
France stands "shoulder-to-shoulder" with America on Bosnia,
supports increased U.S. engagement in Africa and wants to maintain
"cohesion" with U.S. policy towards Iraq, Richard noted.

<HEADLINE> Greece: Sovereignty of Aegean Islands Not Negotiable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Greece said Thursday that the
Greek sovereignty of islands and islets in the Aegean Sea was not
negotiable.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a flag-raising ceremony on the Meko-200 frigate
"Psarra," Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos stressed that
there was nothing up for negotiation because the international law
and the treaty of Lausanne clearly defined the Greek sovereignty
of the Aegean islands, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The international justice court at the Hague was also the
appropriate venue for the delineation of the Aegean continental
shelf, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that talks about the
confidence-building measures between Greece and Turkey in the
Aegean could help ease the tension there if there was political
will.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have been at odds over decades for their
differences in the territorial waters, air space limits, and the
delineation of the continental shelf in the Aegean and the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Turkey reportedly disputed Greece's sovereignty of
four eastern Aegean islands including Fournoi, Agathonisi,
Farmakonisi and Pserimos.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Economy Rebounds in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Canada's gross domestic product
(GDP) rebounded 0.9 percent in February to the level prior to the
January ice storm, Statistics Canada reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
That translates into an annual growth rate of 3.4 percent in
February, up from 3.3 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturers staged a full recovery, while retailers and
wholesalers made up only half their January declines," the
statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
As in January, construction was once again buoyed by the repair
effort to restore the electric power grid in Eastern Canada.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, insurers suffered a setback as claims for
storm-related damages rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
In February, mining lost ground for a second consecutive month
amid depressed metal prices and unseasonably warm winter weather,
the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. Should Minimize Damage to Cubans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Thursday that the U.S. embargo against Cuba has been useful,
but acknowledged Washington should minimize the damage to the
Cuban people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the White House, Clinton
also rejected the call to allow Cuba to return the Organization
of American States (OAS).
</P>
<P>
"I think that it has been useful. But I also believe that we
should do more to minimize the damage to the Cuban people, which
is why after the pope's visit I relaxed a lot of the restrictions
on the transfer of food and medicine, and on travel there," said
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imposed the embargo against Cuba 38 years ago, in an
attempt to change its political system.
</P>
<P>
Canada, Mexico and Brazil have led a diplomatic campaign to
make OAS to resume the membership of Cuba, which was suspended two
years after Cuban President Fidel Castro came to power in 1959.
</P>
<P>
"To open up the OAS or the Summit of the Americas process to a
non-democratic nation, in my view, would be a big mistake,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said other American countries such as Canada were free
to disagree with the United States on how to treat Cuba.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Roar Back on Friendly Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Stocks rebounded sharply Thursday
as investors bought stocks amid optimism that the economy is
robust and inflation is asleep, fueled by friendly data.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose as much as 177 points
before finishing 111.85 points higher at 9,063.37.
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by more than a 3-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 693.04 million
shares as against 638.10 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
In other markets, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose
17.13 to 1,111.75, and the NYSE composite index rose 9.07 to
577.37.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 16.77 to 1,868.41.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.91 to
482.89, and the American Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.20
to 746.52.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indexes also rallied after the Commerce
Department said gross domestic product grew a
stronger-than-expected 4.2 percent in the first quarter while the
implicit price deflator, a key inflation indicator, rose only 0.9
percent -- its smallest increase in 34 years.
</P>
<P>
A government report indicated that wages and benefits -- which
often account for two-thirds of a product's price -- rose just 0.7
percent from January through March.
</P>
<P>
The unexpectedly mild increase in the government's Employment
Cost Index came despite a robust economy that held the
unemployment rate to 4.7 percent in the first three months of
1998, the best quarterly showing since 1970.
</P>
<P>
Today's data also soothed the inflation-sensitive bond market,
where the yield on the 30-year Treasury sank below 6 percent for
the first time since it jumped above that threshold on Monday.
