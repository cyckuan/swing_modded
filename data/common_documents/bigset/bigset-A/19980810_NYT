 &HT;    Seinfeld tells his classic jokes for the `last time'
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If only he'd ended his sitcom just like this.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld closed out his old stand-up act Sunday night on
HBO in a live performance on Broadway that was practically
everything last season's gone-for-good Seinfeld finale wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   In his ``Jerry Seinfeld: I'm Telling You for the Last Time _
Live on Broadway,'' the comic was funny, breezy, light on his toes
and heavy on familiar but still-leave-'em-wanting punchlines.
</P>
<P>
   Like Seinfeld's classic Tide joke. ``If you've got a T-shirt
with blood stains all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest
problem right now.''
</P>
<P>
   You get it. Heard it all before. Enjoyed it all again.
</P>
<P>
   The jokes kept rolling for just over an hour. Maybe Chris Rock's
terrific, obscenity-filled ``tired, tired, tired'' tirade on his
own HBO special ``Bring the Pain'' does make him the late '90s
comic of the moment. But Seinfeld's infectious humor, as nearly
squeaky clean as Superman, makes him a comic for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   For the Seinfeld savvy who lack HBO, here's a sampling of what
you missed:
</P>
<P>
   _ Inside the yellow car: ``I don't even know what it takes to
get a cab driver's license. I think all you need is a face. This
seems to be their big qualification. No blank heads are allowed
driving cabs in this town. Also helps to have a name with like
eight consonants in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In Florida, they're everywhere: ``What is that age that old
people reach when they decide when they back out of the driveway,
they are not looking anymore? ... They just go and then, `well, I'm
old and I'm coming back. I survived. Let's see if you can.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ Only the cows know: ``Ever had milk the day after the
(expiration) date? Scares the hell out of you, doesn't it? ... I
smelled it, you smelled it. What's it supposed to smell like? It
smells like milk! I don't know how they're so definite, though.
Maybe the cows tip 'em off when they're milking them.'' (He leans
forward like a cow, turns his head and says, ``July 3.'')
</P>
<P>
   _ Can you spell pain relief? ``Nobody wants anything less than
extra strength. ... Give me the maximum allowable human dosage.
Figure out what will kill me and then back it off a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Olympic dream: ``You win the gold, you feel good. You win
the bronze, you think, `well, at least I got something.' You win
the silver _ that's like you almost won. Of all the losers, you
came in first of that group. You are the No. 1 loser. No one lost
ahead of you.''

`PRIVATE RYAN' MARCHING ON AT BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan''
narrowly won a third straight box-office battle with an estimated
$17.6 million at 2,592 theaters nationwide during the Friday-Sunday
period, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The performance, which gave the D-Day epic an impressive $104
million in its first 17 days, highlighted a strong weekend for
moviegoing overall, with the top dozen films taking in $106.7
million, up 30 percent from the same weekend last year. Analyst
Arthur Rockwell of Drake &AMP; Co. said studios have done a decent job
of scheduling a diverse slate of attractive films this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an incredible amount of product that's pretty strong
across the board,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan,'' a DreamWorks SKG release that is
already a leading Academy Awards contender, saw its Friday-Sunday
take fall by a mere 26 percent from its second weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie continues to play very well to all demographics,''
said distribution chief James Tharp. ``And we are starting to see
substantial repeat business.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell said, `` `Saving Private Ryan' should have a terrific
run for the rest of the summer.'' Industry tracker Robert Bucksbaum
of Reel Source projected final domestic box office for ``Saving
Private Ryan'' should top $160 million by the end of the year.
``There's really no direct competition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' became the only movie besides
``Titanic'' to top the weekend box office three times this year. It
also became the 174th film to top the $100million mark in U.S.
grosses and the eighth 1998 title to hit the milestone, joining
``Deep Impact,'' ``Godzilla,'' ``The Truman Show,'' ``Mulan,''
``Dr. Dolittle,'' ``Armageddon'' and ``Lethal Weapon 4.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' edged a pair of respectable openings _
Paramount's Nicolas Cage action-thriller ``Snake Eyes'' with $16.5
million at 2,713 theaters and Miramax's horror sequel ``Halloween:
H20'' with $16 million at 2,607 sites. The latter, which cost a
lowly $17 million to produce and featured Jamie Lee Curtis
reprising her role from the 1978 original, has taken in $24.6
million since its roll-out Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum projected that ``Snake Eyes'' could reach $75 million
while ``Halloween: H20'' will hit $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miramax has obviously succeeded very well at tapping the youth
market for horror films,'' Rockwell said. The same studio had
back-to-back $100 million-plus domestic performances from the two
``Scream'' films.
</P>
<P>
   Also performing impressively was 20th Century Fox's fourth
weekend of ``There's Something About Mary,'' with $9.7 million at
2,111 screens as it went past the $76 million mark and lost just 11
percent from the prior weekend. With a budget of only $25 million,
it is likely to be among the most profitable movies in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary'' was followed by a trio of entries with solid returns in
their second weekends _ Disney's ``The Parent Trap,'' with $8.2
million at 2,402 sites, Fox's ``Ever After,'' with $7.2 million at
2,067 locations and Warner Bros.' ``The Negotiator,'' with $6.3
million at 2,436 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's fourth weekend of ``The Mask of Zorro'' came in eighth
with $5.7 million at 2,515 sites, followed by Disney's sixth
weekend of ``Armageddon,'' with $5.2 million at 2,123 theaters, and
Warner's fifth weekend of ``Lethal Weapon 4,'' with $5 million at
2,329 locations _ an astounding total for a film in 10th place,
where the usual figure tends to be under $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' has reached $172.7 million in 40 days and ranks
40th on the all-time domestic list, behind ``Rain Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's seventh weekend of ``Dr. Dolittle'' finished 11th with
$2.6 million at 1,826 theaters to top $131 million overall.
</P>
<P>
   The only significant disappointment was Universal's second
weekend of ``BASEketball,'' with a meager $975,000 at 1,910
screens, giving the raunchy comedy only $5.7 million overall _ well
short of its $25 million production cost.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date business has topped $4 billion and is 8 percent
ahead of the same period last year. Paramount's ``Titanic,'' a
major factor in that increase, drew $935,000 at 681 theaters in its
34th weekend to push its overall domestic total to $597.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' will face competition next weekend from
two new entries _ Warner's action-drama ``The Avengers,'' starring
Sean Connery and Uma Thurman, and Fox's romance ``How Stella Got
Her Groove Back.'' Miramax will open ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver''
for the tough-to-crack family market.

<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ American intelligence officers and
law-enforcement personnel from around the world streamed into
Nairobi Sunday to search for clues in the terrorist bombing that
killed at least 190 people and wounded nearly 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   A mother and son were found alive Sunday in a bank building
damaged in the blast, and rescuers were continuing an excruciating
search for survivors, using picks, shovels, crowbars, sledgehammers
and their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Here and in Washington, a global investigation into the nearly
simultaneous attacks on the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
began to take shape. Some evidence may come from videocameras
mounted on the roofs of both embassies, although officials in Kenya
and Tanzania said they were not sure whether the cameras had
recorded the explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said their investigation was likely to reach across
Africa and the Arabian peninsula to Afghanistan, looking into
terrorist networks with bases in at least four countries and into a
need for stepped-up security at vulnerable American diplomatic
posts around the world.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said they feared that forensic evidence from
the bombing might have been destroyed in the frantic search for the
wounded and dead in the wreckage left by the explosion. Only Sunday
did American investigators begin to secure the site of the blast
and begin a painstaking search for evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are conflicting priorities,'' a senior American official
here said. ``One is removing survivors and removing remains.
Another is gaining evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli rescuers found a mother and a son unharmed Sunday on the
20th floor of the Cooperative Bank of Kenya building adjacent to
the embassy. The mother was identified as Grace Odinda.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Oren Loefler, a spokesman for the Israeli rescue team,
told Reuters that the boy, who he said was about 12, was in the
apartment at the time of the explosion, and that his mother had
entered afterward to find him. They waited there for two days, too
frightened to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers said that Sunday afternoon, at least one woman,
named Rose, was still alive in the wreckage of Ufundi House, a
seven-story office building next door to the embassy. The rescuers
heard her as they clambered over a 40-foot-high pile of debris
containing dozens of bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is alive,'' said an Israeli officer, Alon Seren. ``She is
stuck in a difficult place, and it is very dangerous for us to
rescue her.''
</P>
<P>
   But as darkness fell, the voice of Rose fell still, and rescuers
were not sure if she was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The rescuers were bringing out the dead, one every 20 minutes.
``We have pulled out bodies with our bare hands,'' said Meital
Hallawi, another member of the Israeli team. ``We are just like
robots. We can't have any feelings if we want to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Miriam Olumola, 38, a cashier at Ufundi House who had left the
building to run a quick errand when the bomb went off on Friday
morning, helped Kenyan Red Cross workers identify the bodies.
``They have just found a friend of mine,'' she said. ``There are 28
more people in there, they say. I knew some of them. I passed them
by at work.''
</P>

<P>
   The chance of a terrorist assault on the Nairobi embassy had
been rated as slim by officials at the State Department and the
CIA, according to Paul Peterson, the embassy's regional security
officer. Security risks at embassies are ranked as low, medium,
high and critical by those analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said that ``Nairobi was low'' _ so low that the
embassy, one of the largest American diplomatic outposts in Africa,
shelters diplomats from the U.S. mission in the neighboring Sudan,
where the CIA had warned of a possible attack in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five FBI agents, 11 officers from the CIA's
Counterterrorist Center and scores of military intelligence
officers and State Department security experts arrived in Nairobi
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At the embassy here, not a single room was untouched by the
blast. A slightly tattered American flag hung limply from the roof
Sunday, surrounded by twisted metal, a ruined satellite dish and a
disabled security camera.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion, which destroyed ``the brain center of the
embassy,'' in the words of Peterson, came from a vehicle that
breached a thin layer of security at the rear of the building.
Embassy officials said the vehicle had apparently been driven past
a manually operated barrier staffed by an employee of the
Cooperative Bank of Kenya to the edge of a ramp leading to the
embassy's underground garage.
</P>
<P>
   There, a few feet from the first-story windows of the embassy,
the vehicle exploded with a force that hurled a maelstrom of flying
glass and debris over a 10-block radius in downtown Nairobi,
damaged buildings 500 feet away and shattered thousands of lives.
As of Sunday evening, 190 people were known dead _155 people who
were outside the embassy and 35 who were inside.
</P>
<P>
   Among the embassy's staff, 12 Americans were confirmed dead
Sunday. Twenty-four Kenyan employees were dead, and uncounted
dozens were missing, American officials said. The death toll
represented roughly one of every five Americans in the building at
the time of the explosion, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy held a private memorial service Sunday for employees
who were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Prudence Bushnell, who had been giving a speech at
the Cooperative Bank building down the street from the embassy at
the moment of the explosion and was slightly wounded, toured the
ruins of the mission Sunday, walking stiffly, with a slight limp, a
split lip and an expression of mourning.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She emerged, looking devastated, briefly stopping to touch a
rosebud on a memorial bouquet standing by the embassy's entrance
before she drove away.
</P>
<P>
   With the embassy ruined, its staff and the new arrivals from the
FBI, the CIA, the State Department and the Pentagon are using the
headquarters of the U.S. Agency for International Development,
where the investigation is headed by Joseph Melrose, the
ambassador-designate to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The information being analyzed by the investigators Sunday
included a witness's report, not yet independently confirmed, that
three men were seen stealthily videotaping the embassy on Monday,
an American official said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI forensic technicians, State Department security experts,
Navy Seabees, and Fairfax County, Va., firefighters detailed to the
State Department's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance began
combing the embassy building Sunday, looking both for signs of life
and clues to the crime. Among the firefighters' ranks were veterans
of the team that rushed to Oklahoma City after an Army veteran blew
up the federal building there _ a case successfully closed with a
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials said Sunday that the investigation of
this bombing could take months or years.

OSUNA ADJUSTS TO SETUP ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers' acquisition of closer Jeff Shaw a
month ago was accompanied by a quick tailspin by sometime-closer
Antonio Osuna. But difficulties adjusting now seem to be well
behind the 25-year-old right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   With two innings of scoreless relief Saturday, Osuna extended
his career-best winning streak to seven _ the second longest active
streak in the National League. He's pitched 82/3 scoreless innings
over his last eight appearances to lower his ERA from 3.21 to 2.72.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's throwing the ball like he was before,'' manager
Glenn Hoffman said. ``He seems to be pumped up.''
</P>
<P>
   The July 4 acquisition of Shaw from the Cincinnati Reds sent
Osuna into a temporary funk as he readjusted to the setup role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe all that stuff (the Shaw trade) did affect him a little
bit, but he's on track now,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he just got more aggressive with his fastball, putting
it in the right spot. The last couple days here, he's played a big
part (22/3 innings in two wins over the Pirates).''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna has stranded 10 of the last 11 runners he's inherited and
ranks third in the NL in percentage of inherited runners allowed to
score.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrin honored: The Dodgers held a tribute to longtime
Spanish-radio broadcaster Jaime Jarrin before Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrin, who calls Dodgers games for KWKW-AM (1330), was inducted
into the Hall of Fame earlier this year, his 40th year covering the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaime, if you had a uniform number, we would retire it
today,'' Peter O'Malley, Dodgers chairman of the board, said.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully saluted Jarrin as a
respected colleague ``and a dear friend for the last 40 years'' and
likened the Ecuadorean immigrant to a protagonist in a Horatio
Alger rags-to-riches story.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done his job with dignity and good taste for 40
years,'' Scully said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodgers manager and current interim general manager Tom
Lasorda called Jarrin ``the Vin Scully of the Latin broadcasters in
this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrin will get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Catch: Pirates left fielder Al Martin won rave reviews
Saturday for his eighth-inning circus catch in the seats near the
foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs and runners at second and third base, Gary
Sheffield hit a 320-foot foul ball, and Martin made a backward
flying leap into the first row to make the catch and end a
potential Dodgers rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``As good as it's going to get,'' said Pirates manager Gene
Lamont. ``With the tying run on third, that was a huge catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Martin: ``I knew I was close to the rail, but I didn't know
exactly where I was. I didn't have time to think about it. I just
went for it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a blow to the Dodgers, who thought their last chance
might have been snuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like, it's gonna be a rough night,'' said Eric Young.
Instead, Young drove home the game-winning run in the bottom of the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Rebounding: Young's game-winning, one-out single completed the
Dodgers' 29th comeback victory of the season and the 15th in their
last at-bat.

WELCOME PGA, TO BIG TREES AND STRIP MALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Welcome, PGA Championship golfers, to the Royal
&AMP; Ancient Links of Redmond, where civilized history stretches all
the way back to the time of colorful legends, such as Clan
Partridge.
</P>
<P>
   Before man walked on the moon, before Saturday night became
fevered, before every American knew the intimate details of the
impeachment process (Nixon's, not Clinton's), there was, barely,
Sahalee (Native American term for ``no parking''), rising from the
primordial mists of lot lines on subdivision plats.
</P>
<P>
   Just as golf's history predates Columbus's request for the boat
keys from Queen Isabella, the richness of the suburban tradition of
Sahalee goes back several years.
</P>
<P>
   Host city Redmond (Native American for ``strip malls unto the
horizon''), once home to primitives such as cows, horses and
bicycles, now looms as the Instant Three-Story Office Building
Capital of America. Merely toss a building permit to the ground,
add a water hookup and _ presto! _ Scottsdale Without Stucco.
</P>
<P>
   But please don't confuse it with those soulless, vacuous sprawls
of the American Southwest, or everywhere in California.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing for golf visitors to know about Redmond
is that within its city limits (indistinguishable though they are)
is more money than any place the golfers will play. Even more than
Palm Springs, Palm Beach, Palm(er) Arnold, or wherever it was they
thought was filthy with wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond is Microsoft, source of the American gross national
product, which also has a shop in which it produces business
monopolies and a little computer software. Everyone there is richer
than Greg Norman, the PGA career money leader who decided to fake a
shoulder injury and avoid this tournament so his economic punyness
would not be a source of humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Where 30 years ago the only fences kept cows from the sheep, now
there are enough walls, gates, turrets and drawbridges surrounding
some Redmond residences to make Scotland's Edinburgh Castle look as
vulnerable as a downtown mini-mart at 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these homes will be visible from the course, a prospect
that tends to be looked upon with disdain by the touring golfers
more used to country clubs devoid of the entrails of
upper-middle-class existence.
</P>
<P>
   But Sahalee is not the usual golf course housing where there is
more taste than restrictive housing covenants. Among the Redmond
requirements are the banning of sidewalks, street addresses more
confusing than Shawn Kemp's gift list on Mother's Day, and
driveways that include a well-scrubbed sport-utility vehicle 24
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, trees. Big trees, not the scrawny East Coast
sissy trees, but cedar, hemlock, spruce, Douglas fir.
Northwesterners must have big trees like the English must have weak
teas. Particularly on the course, where by Sunday golfers new to
this thicket will be so sick of trees they will be carrying
kerosone and matches in their bags.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of this tourney will be the first golfer to fire his
caddy and hire gnomes and fairies to show him the way through the
forest.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only downside to the week will be the weather, so
let me be the first to apologize for it. Whoever the dimwit was who
scheduled this event for the middle of August needs to move on to
another job, like Woody Woodward's bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   This time of year is so unrepresentative of Puget Sound weather
as to be shameful. It is unlikely this week that visitors will see
so much as a cloud, much less rain. For weeks now, moss is dead,
lawns are brown and algae is gray. Not a slug can be found.
</P>
<P>
   It's just so ... phony. The touring pros will spend the entire
week here without once having a shoe sucked off by mud. The greens
will have no standing water, so there will be no putting around the
geese. Nor will there be need for 30-inch tees that can be pushed
down to hardpan.
</P>
<P>
   This is Puget Sound golf? Bah. This is like climbing
Disneyland's Matterhorn instead of the real one. Schedule this
tourney for November, and we'll see who's got game.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA in November would also allow the tourney more marquee
time, because this week it is only the second-biggest event in
Seattle. Sunday's Blue Angels air show drew to the shores of Lake
Washington either 50,000 or 500,000, depending on whether your
crowd-estimating police officer is on the mark, or on the take from
Seafair.

<P>
   As for Sunday's annoying boats on the water ... well, we've
tried for years to explain it, but we can't.
</P>
<P>
   Best to think of it as an odd little local custom, perhaps along
the lines of inviting your crazy Uncle Torvald down from the attic
every Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the world's TV cameras here for the tournament were
not turned on yet to catch our dark little secret, so King County's
bond rating remains secure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many surprises remain to be revealed this week on the
Eastside, where the lush Royal &AMP; Ancient Links of Redmond and its
storied tradition will unveil the vertical lumberyard, property
taxes soaring overhead, to astonished visitors.
</P>
<P>
   If the golf visitor gets lost or confused, simply remember what
Sahalee means: No parking.
</P>
<P>
   Don't stop until you find a mall.

KITNA POISED TO MAKE IMPACT FOR SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Just when Jon Kitna was getting comfortable with being
compared to Dave Krieg, another large log has been tossed on the
fire of excitement and anticipation blazing around the Seahawks'
young quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Mike Pritchard did it after Kitna completed 9 of
13 passes while directing two scoring drives in his first preseason
start Saturday night in a 24-21 victory over the Indianapolis Colts
at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard compared Kitna to, of all people, Green Bay's Pro Bowl
quarterback, Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon is a student of the game and he wants to get better. And
that's what you want in a young quarterback, somebody who wants to
be the best,'' Pritchard said.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard then shared a conversation he had with Favre in 1991
while both were in Atlanta. Favre was a rookie quarterback, a trade
to the Green Bay Packers and five seasons removed from becoming a
two-time league MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brett was always saying: `You know what? I'm going to be the
best quarterback in this league. You just watch, Pritch,' ''
Pritchard said. ``That's Kitna. He wants to be better, and he's
passing the test. That's who I compare Jon to right now _ that
young Brett Favre who was going to be the best and not let anyone
or anything stop him.''
</P>
<P>
   If Saturday night's game was a test, and it definitely was,
Kitna aced it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep giving him tests and he just keeps passing them,''
vice president of football operations Randy Mueller said about the
undrafted, second-year player from Central Washington. ``There were
things we wanted to see Jon do in this game, and we saw him do all
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The significance of Kitna's leaps-and-bounds development has
intensified because starter Warren Moon's holdout is entering its
fourth week and John Friesz did not play well after replacing Kitna
against the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Talks about restructuring Moon's contract are back to being
one-sided, because the club says it does not have the $4.5 million
Moon is seeking this season. The team is holding firm on its offer
of a one-year, $2 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Warren doesn't come back,'' Kitna said, bluntly, ``I'd be
more than happy to step in and take the job.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Kitna started against the Colts. Everyone _ from
owner Paul Allen, to the coaches, to his teammates, to Kitna _
needed to see if he could do the things he has been doing on the
practice field in a game against another team's No. 1 defense.
</P>
<P>
   They saw Kitna make the throws, improvise and move the offense.
</P>
<P>
   His completion percentage would have been even higher if tight
end Christian Fauria had not slipped at the goal line to cause one
incompletion and wide receiver Joey Galloway had not let another
pass go off his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Showing a knack for making something from nothing, Kitna
scrambled 15 yards on the drive that ended with his TD pass to
Pritchard and later changed a play at the line of scrimmage and
completed a pass for a first down.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna produced 171 of the team's 371 yards in 31 plays _
compared to 200 yards in 53 plays after he left. Kitna was 3 of 4
for 47 yards on third-down passes, including his 25-yard TD toss to
Pritchard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about it, he gets those chains moving,'' coach
Dennis Erickson said Sunday after reviewing video tape of the game.
``He makes things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kitna's most impressive attribute was his poise. After
getting his frayed nerves under control, he seemed totally
unaffected by everything that was happening around him _ the
pre-game anticipation, the Colts' pass rush, the post-game crush of
reporters around his locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you stand in that huddle and you see (Howard) House
Ballard, Brian Habib, Kevin Glover, Pete Kendall and Walter Jones,
there's a sense of calmness that comes about,'' Kitna said about
his offensive linemen. ``They didn't get all excited for me being
in there. Joey and Pritchard gave me a little bit of a hard time,
but it was all in fun and I had a good time out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna went to Central Washington with plans to be a high school
math teacher, not an NFL quarterback. Asked to grade his
performance against the Colts, he offered: ``I'd say B-plus. I
thought I played pretty well. That's grading on the curve, of
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna was not perfect, and Erickson has yet to say who will
start this week's game against the San Francisco 49ers in
Vancouver, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to continue to get better,'' Erickson said. ``There
were a couple of times he probably should have thrown it someplace
else. But those are things he will continue to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget the closeness of the final score. The Seahawks were
handling the Colts in all three phases of the game before backup
quarterback Kelly Holcomb rallied Indianapolis to a third-quarter
TD and third-string defensive end Kendel Shello returned an Ahman
Green fumble for a score in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks looked good, but are they good enough without Moon?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good football team,'' said Colts offensive line
coach Howard Mudd, who coached the same position the previous five
seasons with the Seahawks. ``They're the real deal.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kitna continues to look too good to be real.
</P>
<P>
   As the last players were filing out of the locker room, he sat
in front of his cubicle playing with his young son, Jordan, who was
dressed in overalls that had a Seahawks logo on the bib.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to hope it's the start of something that could last a
long time,'' he said of his first preseason start. ``It was
exciting to come out and play in front of the home fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice to have the offense get introduced
(before the game),'' he added with a laugh. ``But it was exciting.
It definitely was.''

MARINERS COMPLETE SWEEP OF TIGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ There is a new Tiger Stadium on the way, but Mariner
shortstop Alex Rodriguez has a special place in his heart for the
old one.
</P>
<P>
   The hits keep coming for him in this outdated ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old shortstop hit a three-run home run in the
seventh inning on Sunday, lifting the Mariners to a 6-3 victory
over the Detroit Tigers and a sweep of their four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez went 9-for-15 during the series, scoring seven runs,
hitting two home runs and driving in six runs. He now is hitting
.374 (52-for-139) lifetime against Tiger pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea why I've had so much success here,'' Rodriguez
said. ``Maybe it goes back to when I was 18 years old, had some
good games here and that put some confidence in me.''
</P>
<P>
   With Rodriguez hitting, center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. making an
astounding catch and relievers Bob Wells, Heathcliff Slocumb and
Mike Timlin finishing what Bill Swift started, Seattle got its
first-ever four-game sweep against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were four good games of baseball here,'' Mariner manager
Lou Piniella said. ``We played well in all phases, specifically our
pitching and just great timely hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey Jr. robbed Luis Gonzalez of a two-run homer in the third
inning, reaching over the fence to catch the ball, but the big blow
came off Rodriguez's sizzling bat.
</P>
<P>
   With Shane Monahan and Joey Cora on base, Rodgriguez sent a Matt
Anderson slider over the left field fence, barely over Gonzalez's
glove, for his 35th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a terrible pitch,'' Detroit manager Buddy Bell said.
``For Rodriguez to hit that pitch, he has to be seeing the ball
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more surprising than Rodriguez's uncanny hitting against
Tiger pitching is that Seattle swept the series without getting a
homer from Griffey, who has 41 on the year but now has gone 42
at-bats without clearing a fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Griffey's obviously struggling at the plate right now,'' Bell
said, ``but that tells you something about his game. He played as
good a center field as you can play in this four-game series. He's
an extremely talented guy, and he couldn't have made that catch
unless he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella planned to use Griffey as the designated hitter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has played every day in a demanding position,'' Piniella
said. ``Plus, he is constantly getting bombarded by the media about
the home run record. I think he's tired physically and mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   On cue, Griffey was asked about the homer drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who knows me understands that Roger Maris' record means
nothing to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one is talking about Rodriguez challenging Maris'
single-season home run record of 61, but he moved closer to
becoming only the third player in major league history to hit at
least 40 homers and steal 40 bases in the same season.
</P>
<P>
   Besides hitting his 35th homer Sunday, Rodriguez stole his 33rd
base.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez, contributed his 22nd homer, which gave the
Mariners a 1-0 lead in the second inning, and two singles. Monahan
singled twice and scored a run. And Raul Ibanez, inserted at first
base when Griffey went to center field, slugged an opposite-field
homer to left field in fifth, giving the M's a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Swift checked the Tigers on one run through four innings, but
Detroit scored twice in the bottom of the fifth to grab a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Martinez delivered a game-tying single to center in the
top of the sixth, Wells survived a leadoff double in the bottom
half of the inning, setting the tone for another solid relief
effort from Seattle's bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really pitching well,'' Piniella said of his
once-suspect relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Slocumb ended a Tiger threat in the seventh inning by striking
out pinch-hitting Geronimo Berroa with runners on second and third.
Timlin secured his team-leading ninth save despite Rodriguez's
error on Gonzalez's grounder leading off the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Timlin struck out Damion Easley and Bobby Higginson before
getting match point on a grounder to Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are off Monday and continue the nine-game road trip
Tuesday night in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez continued his hot hitting despite having the middle
finger on his right hand bruised by a pitch Saturday night. The
finger will be examined today in Toronto, where he has a .375
career average and went 6-for-10 at SkyDome earlier this season.

SAHALEE GREETS EARLY ARRIVALS FOR PGA CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ South African Ernie Els, one of the PGA Tour's
tallest players at 6-foot-3, took one look around the fairways of
Sahalee Country Club, site of this week's PGA Championship, and
felt a bit dwarfed by the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen trees this tall on a golf course,'' the
two-time U.S. Open champion said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sahalee's tall firs and cedars caught the attention of the early
arrivals in a field that includes the world's top 150 golfers vying
for the last major championship of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Among those on the course Sunday for a practice round were last
year's PGA runner-up Justin Leonard, 1989 PGA champion Payne
Stewart, 1992 PGA runner-up Nick Faldo and U.S. Open champion Lee
Janzen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like heavily tree-lined courses, and being very narrow
doesn't bother me any,'' said Janzen, who tamed another tight
course at the Open, San Francisco's Olympic Club. ``You just have
to start the ball straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Janzen traveled eight hours Saturday from his home in Orlando,
Fla., to get ready for a run at his second major title of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just good to get here early and then be rested for
Tuesday and Wednesday to get some real good work in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was important for him to get an early look at the
Redmond course because of his loss last year to defending champion
Davis Love III, Leonard replied: ``Not just because of that, but
because this is a major championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those competing for $2.6 million in prize money will be 13
past PGA Champions, including Love, who will be trying to become
the first repeat title holder in 61 years.
</P>
<P>
   While the players trickled in Sunday, tournament volunteers,
Sahalee staff and PGA officials were adding the final trimmings for
the Northwest's first major golf championship since 1946, when Ben
Hogan won the event at the Portland Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very exciting and very educational,'' said Sahalee
member George Smith, who has helped run the annual Northwest
Players Championship at the course, but never managed an event of
the magnitude of the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pride here right now,'' added Jim Pike,
Sahalee's head pro. ``Pride among the membership in that they
actually realize now that the tournament is here and that they see
the world is ready to showcase their golf course. And they are
elated that it's in such good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about a dozen spectators gathered around the practice green
and driving range Sunday, taking in the last day of peace and
serenity before the crowds of up to 30,000 begin to show up.
Practice rounds will be conducted Monday through Wednesday before
the tournament begins on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the onlookers was Frank Carter of Yakima, who will work
for the rest of the week as one of the tournament's volunteer
security officers while his wife, Bonnie, works in the merchandise
tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't miss this for the world,'' he said. ``As soon as
the call went out for volunteers, we put our hats in.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players who arrived Sunday had never seen the course
before and were favorably impressed by the beauty of the layout and
the ideal summer weather.
</P>
<P>
   Faldo, an Englishman who also makes his home in Orlando, Fla.,
found the conditions pleasant compared to the sticky humidity of
last year's PGA Championship at Winged Foot in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played in Portland and Vancouver (B.C.) before, but not
here. This is lovely indeed,'' Faldo said.
</P>
<P>
   For Faldo, getting to the course early was important just to get
a feel for the conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere is great and it looks really nice,'' he said of
the course.
</P>
<P>
   Els agreed. ``I've heard some really good things about the
course, and it just looks beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Also playing a practice round was Scott Williams, a teaching pro
at Bellevue's Glendale Country Club who qualified for this event by
finishing ninth during the PGA Club Pro Championship in June.
Williams lives barely a mile from Sahalee and has played the course
at least a dozen times since qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course is firming up a little bit more, and it appears
that the greens are a hair quicker this week'' because of the warm
weather, Williams said. ``They are going to get a lot faster, but
the course is in very good shape. It's getting tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams noted that the rough, now 4-6 inches deep, is as tough
as he's ever seen it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't hit many shots out of it, not that I haven't hit
many into it,'' Williams said. ``Right now, I don't want to hurt
myself, literally, by hitting out of the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Els has played only once before in the Seattle area, during the
Fred Couples Invitational three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite important to get out early for a course you have
never seen before to get a look at it when there are not many
players out here,'' he said. ``You want to start getting a picture
of what you have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason he was able to get to Seattle early was because he
has taken three weeks off from other PGA events to rest his back,
which had been giving him trouble since before the U.S. Open in
July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how it goes, but I think my back should be OK,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pike praised the members for their work in getting the course
ready and noted that the PGA now takes over most of the work
surrounding the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my staff handling the range and the carts, and Thursday
through Sunday I'll either be starting on the first hole or
announcing on nine or 18,'' Pike said. ``I feel like I'm the
luckiest guy in the world. The only thing that would have been
better is to be playing.''

U.S. whips Greece, takes third place
<TEXT>
<P>
   By EDDIE SEFKO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ Two teams were above them on the risers during
the medal ceremony for the 13th FIBA World Championship of
Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody stood taller than these Americans as they accepted
their bronze medals and floral bouquets Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   They've been called misfits, castoffs, unknowns, and the
basketball equivalent of riffraff. But the 12 players, led by coach
Rudy Tomjanovich, who cruised to third place with an 84-61 bashing
of the host team from Greece, knew as they draped their rewards
around their necks that they had done more than anybody at home in
the United States could have expected.
</P>
<P>
   They represented their country with class and won their spot on
the medal stand with heart and sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to set your goals for the gold,'' David Wood
said. ``But I can't think of anything I'm more proud of than this
medal. It's probably the greatest accomplishment of my basketball
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven teammates felt the same way, although their
disappointment at not getting to play for the gold medal was
obvious. And understandable. They had lost a heartbreaking 66-64
game to Russia a night earlier, dooming them to play the Greeks for
the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some disappointment,'' Tomjanovich said. ``Our goal
was the gold. We were two points away from having that opportunity.
Then to have this challenge against a very, very good Greek team on
their court and to come up with a big win _ I couldn't be more
proud of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely a month in the making, the Americans didn't leave with
the gold. But they were better than 13 countries that have had
their national teams together much longer. And they were far better
than the Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Greek reporter that said we were the lint after the wash
might want to retract that statement,'' Wood said. ``I guess we
stick in there, don't we?''
</P>
<P>
   As Ashraf Amaya added: ``It wasn't the gold, but we didn't go
home empty-handed. It's not the one we wanted, but we have to be
thankful. It could have been a lot worse. There were a lot of
people who didn't think we'd even be playing for a medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we represented the country very well. We kept our
character. We kept our poise. I don't think any team we played
against could say that we did anything like trash-talking or cheap
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   With 15,000 Greeks cheering on the home team Sunday, the U.S.
team was faced with the task of having to play Greece for the
bronze medal. It was the equivalent of an ant having the home-hill
advantage against the elephant. The Americans squashed them.
</P>
<P>
   The American replacement players for the Dream Team were on
equal footing with Russia, Yugoslavia, Italy and others in the
tournament, but they showed the Greeks how much distance the
blossoming basketball country has to cover before it can stand
toe-to-toe with even America's non-NBA talent.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia eked out a 64-62 victory over Russia in the
gold-medal game; the Americans felt almost as if they had
accomplished more than the Dream Team did in sweeping to the gold
medal in the past two Olympics or the '94 World Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans jumped on Greece early, scoring 15 consecutive
points to go ahead 19-6 as Jimmy Oliver and Jason Sasser each
scored five points in the run.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it was all for show. The lead grew to 38-18 before
halftime, then hit 80-50 late in the game before the Greeks trimmed
the margin in the final three minutes. Sasser led the Americans
with 23 points. But as always, they were balanced, with every
player scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected a much tougher game,'' Tomjanovich said. ``They
have never won a medal before. But our guys wanted a medal very
badly, too. They (the Greeks) were a little bit down, but I give
credit to my team.''
</P>
<P>
   For the players, the joy outweighed the frustration of playing
for third place instead of first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to get the gold medal,'' Oliver said.
``Unfortunately, we lost and weren't able to do that. So we wanted
to finish as good as we could.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always are going to say something. People are never
going to be happy with anything less than the gold medal. And even
if we had won the gold medal, they would have said, `Yeah, but they
aren't the Dream Team.' I just think we played hard and did our
best. Getting the bronze makes the trip more enjoyable than losing
and getting nothing. To have something concrete to hold on to is
important. Not getting anything would have been terrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't out to prove people wrong or compete against (the
legacy) of the Dream Team. We just were trying to be the best that
this team could be.''
</P>
<P>
   That best turned out to be bronze. In hindsight, the reason the
Americans didn't get a chance to play Yugoslavia for the gold was
their shooting in the semifinal game.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that we had throughout the tournament was making the
3-point shot,'' said Del Harris, an assistant to Tomjanovich. ``In
this game, we make it. Last night (against Russia), if we just make
one more, it's a different story. One little thing here or there
can be a big difference. Against Russia we were 4-for-22, and
tonight we were better (7-for-18).''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich had nothing but fond memories of the tournament and
said it was hard to believe the entire thing was over in just more

   ``A month ago, when we were putting this team together, nobody
gave us much of a chance at any kind of success,'' he said. ``We
didn't know what would happen. But these were a bunch of
hard-working players who came together very quickly. I couldn't be
prouder.''

BIG TRADE IS GOLDEN... BUT IS IT FOOL'S GOLD?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The luster from The Big Trade, suffice to
say, no longer dazzles the crowd at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the Texas Rangers are better. I think. Maybe. Kinda.
</P>
<P>
   And I say that unequivocably. Sort of. Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   But after Sunday night's 14-8 loss to Boston, reality is
starting to bite at the Rangers' new wings. The new pitcher pitches
like the old pitcher. The new third baseman, alas, is no longer
batting .800.
</P>
<P>
   What could have been a playoff-preview series with the Red Sox
over the weekend ended up unearthing more question marks than it
answered. Like, just how silly/intriguing would Mo Vaughn look next
year in red shoes? And who exactly is the No. 1 starter in this
fickle Rangers rotation?
</P>
<P>
   Add to the intrigue the strained ribcage of Lee Stevens and the
stiff neck of Juan Gonzalez, and you get an idea of the extra
baggage that the Rangers will tote on the road with them this week.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days in American League shark tanks like Jacobs Field,
Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park could sink the Rangers' playoff
optimism, or send it bobbing merrily to the surface. In either
case, what happened Saturday and Sunday at The Ballpark didn't
qualify as a champagne sendoff.
</P>
<P>
   The combined line for Rangers starting pitchers Aaron Sele and
Todd Stottlemyre looked like such:
</P>
<P>
   A total of 8 innings, 14 hits, 13 runs, 7 walks, 3 home runs, 2
losses.
</P>
<P>
   What new guy Stottlemyre showed in grit in his first outing
dissolved into murky disarray Sunday night against the Red Sox. He
was all over the place. That elusive AL strike zone?
</P>
<P>
   Even at his worst, Stottlemyre looks more capable and more
confident than the departed Darren Oliver ever showed this season.
But not getting through the fifth inning was what soured the
Rangers on Oliver in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four new acquisitions, Stottlemyre has been the most
disappointing and _ for the Rangers _ the most potentially
devastating. When your purported No. 1 guy in the rotation can't do
it consistently, you're on a treadmill, not a race to a pennant.
</P>
<P>
   The visiting Red Sox were deemed a good measuring stick. They
are the best of the AL's non-division leaders, eternally doomed to
be graded on the pinstriped curve. If the Red Sox' 68-47 record
were in the AL West, on a 97-degree night like Sunday, the Rangers
wouldn't have been hearing cheers, but crickets.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers promptly won the first two games of the series, and
The Big Trade was looking downright invigorating. But then came
Sele's and Stottlemyre's outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of the way the team responded,'' first baseman
Vaughn said, after Boston had leveled the series and he,
personally, had left craters on the center-field hill. ``It was
great to get the last two to wrap up a very successful road trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, of course, is the loudest, largest, impending free-agent
first baseman that will be on the market this winter. The Rangers
have one, too. In fact, Rangers first baseman Will Clark had more
runs batted in than Vaughn going into Sunday night's contest.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of Vaughn, wearing Rangers red, taking aim at The
Ballpark's right-field porch should drive some fans giddy. He does,
remember, figure to cost about twice on the open market what Clark
will.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there's this pitching itch that won't go away.
Inconsistency haunts the Rangers starters.
</P>
<P>
   They got eight runs ... against Boston ... and lost?
</P>
<P>
   After the game, manager Johnny Oates offered the opinion, ``I
think we have a much better team right now than we did at the start
of the homestand.''
</P>
<P>
   That was one Stottlemyre, a Todd Zeile and one Royce Clayton
ago. And Oates is right, if for no reason than Clayton alone. The
new shortstop's play in the eighth inning Sunday night _ going into
left field, spinning, and doubling off Orlando Merced at first base
was a season highlight.
</P>
<P>
   But after his steamy start, Zeile is starting to return to room
temperature. Stottlemyre, again, was expected to pitch better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think just winning some ballgames gives a team confidence,''
left fielder Rusty Greer said. ``If we can play consistently, put
some more wins together, we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, in other words, the simplest tasks, put simply,
present the most taxing challenges.
</P>
<P>
   A huge road test against Jim Thome-less Cleveland, mighty New
York and Vaughn-fueled Boston awaits.
</P>
<P>
   For the Rangers, the Big Trade doesn't shine like gold anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But they're better. Sort of. Kinda. As we'll soon see.

STOTTLEMYRE TAKES BLAME FOR BAD OUTING
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The first person who locates right-hander
Todd Stottlemyre within shouting distance of an excuse deserves an
exorbitant finder's fee.
</P>
<P>
   No one should expect to become rich.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who sustained an injury to his rib cage before the
Texas Rangers acquired the 33-year-old pitcher July 31 from the
Cardinals, refused to alibi for his problems in a 14-8 loss to the
Red Sox on Sunday night at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre _ who manager Johnny Oates removed before the fifth
inning _ could not prevent the Rangers from incurring their second
consecutive loss, which allowed the Angels to move to two games
behind the American League West front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to use that as an excuse,'' Stottlemyre said.
``One thing I won't do is make excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates also dismissed any concerns regarding Stottlemyre's
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I created my own jams by walking people,'' Stottlemyre said.
``You walk four guys against a team like that and ...''
</P>
<P>
   Well, a pitcher pays for it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the evening became worse after Stottlemyre (1-1) departed
with the Rangers trailing, 6-2. Left-hander Eric Gunderson promptly
surrendered seven runs in his 1 2/3 innings, which effectively
negated the Rangers' six-run fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Red Sox's seemingly endless third inning
proved ghastly and exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who issued walks to four of the 10 Red Sox batters,
required 57 pitches to complete the lengthy inning. Catcher Scott
Hatteberg greeted Stottlemyre with a leadoff single and advanced to
third on the ensuing walks to second baseman Donnie Sadler _ the
Red Sox's No. 9 hitter _ and center fielder Darren Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw the ball in the right areas, but I kept missing by
three-to-six inches,'' said Stottlemyre, who allowed four walks in
5 2/3 innings in his start Tuesday against the Blue Jays. ``They
had a pretty good game plan coming in. They were aggressive early
and were able to take a lot of close pitches. It was a bit
uncharacteristic for me, but it's not like I was wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg and Sadler scored on a line drive that John Valentin
whacked into right field, and the Red Sox loaded the bases again
when first baseman Mo Vaughn drew the third walk of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Todd Zeile, who the Rangers acquired from the
Marlins on the same afternoon they obtained Stottlemyre, prolonged
the inning with his second error in three games on a potential
double-play ground ball off the bat of shortstop Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis scored the Red Sox's third run on the play, and designated
hitter Orlando Merced later drew a run-scoring walk to culminate
the four-run inning. Stottlemyre retired Hatteberg on strikes _ his
third strikeout of the inning _ before returning to the dugout with
81 pitches through four innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might be an all-timer for me,'' Stottlemyre said of the
57-pitch inning. ``I gave up four runs, but I could have given up
10 that inning.''
</P>
<P>
   It served as a distinct contrast from the second inning, in
which he retired the side in order on strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the game, Todd was making all the pitches he had
to,'' Oates said. ``Then, he started missing by two or three inches
and just couldn't make the correction.''
</P>
<P>
   The appearance represented the third consecutive start for
Stottlemyre where he didn't reach six innings. He had done that in
21 of his first 22 starts.
</P>
<P>
   The rib cage might be bothering Stottlemyre, but the world will
never know if it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not to make any excuses for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So we understand.

   NAPALM-DISPOSAL (Deer Park, Texas) _ Four months ago, after
local residents and politicians screamed bloody murder, a train
carrying 22,000 gallons of napalm en route to an Indiana disposal
facility was abruptly halted and turned back to California, where
it had been moldering since the end of the Vietnam War. In July,
another toxic waste company inherited the napalm disposal contract.
But this time the company, GNI Group, is situated along Houston's
heavily industrialized Ship Channel, one of the globe's largest and
densest concentrations of petro-chemical facilities. The result was
that very same shipment of napalm eased its way into Texas three
weeks ago with only the briefest flurry of complaint.

an underlying global warming trend, say scientists who track such
things, El Nino will probably make 1998 the warmest year in several
centuries. By William K. Stevens.

DODGERS HITTERS DON'T HELP PARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chan Ho Park set out to make history Sunday, but
all the Dodgers right-hander got for his effort was an embarrassing
baserunning error and a broken winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Park carried an 11-game string of wins at Dodger Stadium into
his start against the Pittsburgh Pirates, and a 12th would have
tied Orel Hershiser's club record for consecutive home victories.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Park's seven strong innings went to waste in the wake
of another Dodgers hitting drought and an eventual 2-1 loss to the
Pirates before 43,227. And he had to endure the additional insult
of being thrown out at first base after hitting safely in the sixth
inning when he accidentally turned toward second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disappointed,'' Park (10-6) said of the missed record,
``because I have more (opportunities) in the future. Maybe next
time.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant, of course, the next time he holds an 11-game winning
streak at home, a rarity but not an impossibility for the promising
25-year-old in his third full year in the majors. Hershiser set the
mark at a young age himself (27), winning a dozen from September
1984 to October 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just started,'' noted Park, 16-6 with a 2.56 ERA for his
career at Dodger Stadium. ``I feel more comfortable, confident; I
feel at home here.''
</P>
<P>
   Pirates starter Chris Peters (6-8) looked equally comfortable,
shutting down the Dodgers on four hits over seven innings. His lone
mistake was a seventh-inning solo home run by Bobby Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Dodgers offense was silent. Though they took two
of three games from the Pirates, the Dodgers managed just six runs
in the series, despite having the heart of the order back intact
for the last two games. The Dodgers have scored 11 runs in their
last six games, stranding 40 runners over that span.
</P>
<P>
   Three through five hitters Raul Mondesi, Gary Sheffield and Eric
Karros went hitless in 11 at-bats Sunday. Mondesi struck out three
times in four at-bats for the second game in a row since returning
from a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   The back, while sore, is not to blame, Mondesi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sore, just a little bit. I'm not making excuses,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, cite the afternoon sun in the rare 5 p.m. start
as a problem. ``In the first through fourth innings, I couldn't see
the ball real good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the layoff from the sore lower back, which knocked him out
of two games and parts of two others, probably affected Mondesi's
timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't take batting practice for a week,'' he said. ``I know
I'll get it back. I don't worry about it too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Bonilla's homer _ his first since May 16, a span of
136 at-bats _ the Dodgers got as far as second base only twice.
Mark Grudzielanek's sixth-inning double was their only other
extra-base hit. But it might have gone a long way if not for Park's
baserunning gaffe.
</P>
<P>
   Park led off the sixth with a hard-hit single to right field. As
Pirates right fielder Jose Guillen scooped it up, Park passed first
base and turned just slightly toward second, though he didn't take
a step and thought he was safe. Instead, Guillen threw to catcher
Jason Kendall, who fired back to first baseman Kevin Young, who
applied the tag while Park was jogging back toward the bag.
</P>
<P>
   First-base umpire Rich Rieker called Park out, and arguments
from Park and manager Glenn Hoffman proved futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Rieker) said (Park) made an attempt to second base, which is
correct. He didn't have to go over the foul line,'' Hoffman said.
``That's what he saw and that's what he had to call.''
</P>
<P>
   Park admitted he was unclear on the rule, believing he was safe
as long as he didn't cross the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   The loss prevented the Dodgers from making up another game on
the Chicago Cubs in the wild-card race. L.A. remains four games
behind Chicago, with the New York Mets and San Francisco Giants
ahead of them in the chase.
</P>
<P>
   But taking two of three from the Pirates reopened the door that
nearly slammed shut with last week's trio of losses at Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good series, two out of three,'' Mondesi said. ``If
you do that every series, you make the playoffs.''

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ With Mo Vaughn leaving some historic
footprints, the Red Sox Sunday night stomped out the notion they're
not big enough for Texas, running up double figures in runs for the
second straight game.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn hit home runs in consecutive innings, driving in four
runs, and just missed a third home run in a 14-8 Red Sox win over
the Rangers before a crowd of 31,127 at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hatteberg and rookie Donnie Sadler also homered as the Red
Sox escaped here with a split of their four-game series with the
American League West leaders, scoring 25 runs and collecting 30
hits after losing the first two.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a key part of the season, a key moment after two
losses,'' said Vaughn, who now has 31 home runs, six of which came
on this trip, to become just the third player in Red Sox history to
hit at least 30 in four consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to get even one here. A lot of crazy things happen
to the Boston Red Sox when they come to Texas. I'm very proud of
the way the team responded.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox return home with an 8-4 record on their longest trip
of the season _ a 14-day tour of the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   When they left on July 27, the Red Sox held a 4 1/2-game lead in
the wild-card race. They return home 7 1/2 games ahead of Anaheim,
8 1/2 ahead of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to stick with the right attitude,'' said Vaughn.
``We're all tired. We all feel like we left a month ago, but we
survived it. There's no time now for a letdown. No time not to be
focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmie Foxx hit 30 or more home runs in five consecutive seasons
(1936-40) for the Red Sox. Ted Williams, in a streak that was
interrupted by three years of military service, did it in four
straight seasons (1941-42, 1946-47). They're both in the Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty good company to be in,'' Vaughn said. ``Every
season you have expectations of doing things, but once you get to
30, you want to try and really explode and get on top of your game
as much as possible. There are still a lot of runs to drive in, a
lot of games to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox took advantage of a wild Todd Stottlemyre, who
walked five in the first four innings, and former Sox reliever Eric
Gunderson, who gave up seven runs in 1 2/3 innings in the worst
outing of his career.
</P>
<P>
   John Valentin's two-run single was one of only two hits the Sox
had in their four-run third, in which Stottlemyre threw 57 pitches,
walked four, and was further undone when third baseman Todd Zeile
booted Nomar Garciaparra's double-play grounder with the bases
loaded.
</P>
<P>
   One out after Sadler tripled to open the fourth and scored on
Darren Lewis's sacrifice fly, Vaughn hit his first home run of the
night off Stottlemyre, a 429-foot drive to the deepest part of the
stadium that landed halfway up the lawn beyond the center-field
fence.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn didn't hit his 30th home run last season until Aug. 31,
in the team's 137th game of the season. This one came six weeks
earlier, in game No. 115.
</P>
<P>
   No. 30 made it 6-2, Sox. An inning later, after a double by Troy
O'Leary and walk to Darren Bragg, Hatteberg unloaded off Gunderson
for a three-run home run, his 10th homer of the season and second
on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Gunderson then proceeded to give up a single to Lewis and a walk
to Valentin, setting the stage for Vaughn's first three-run home
run of the season, a 399-foot drive into the bleachers in
left-center.
</P>
<P>
   It was Vaughn's second two-homer game of the series, fourth this
season, and 22d multi-home run game of his career, including the
two occasions when he hit three in a game. In the seventh, Vaughn
drove right fielder Mike Simms back to the warning track for his
flyout, and in his final at-bat he lined deep to left.
</P>
<P>
   But what should have been an easy win for Sox starter John
Wasdin unraveled in the fifth, when Wasdin couldn't stand the
prosperity of a 10-run lead. Wasdin retired 11 in a row, but in the
fifth the Rangers put together five straight hits and four runs,
forcing manager Jimy Williams to go to Derek Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   That quickly, Wasdin blew a chance at his sixth win and an
opportunity to solidify his hold on a spot in the starting
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe walked the first batter he faced and gave up a two-run
double to Will Clark before order was restored. Jim Corsi pitched a
1-2-3 sixth and received credit for his first win since June 1.
Corsi and three relievers _ Dennis Eckersley, Greg Swindell, and
Tom Gordon _ combined to hold the Rangers to one hit in the last
four innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is the way we're playing,'' Williams said. ``The
intensity we're playing with. A lot of people are contributing, up
and down the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's been a tough trip, but it's behind us. We played
good, we pitched good, and we ended on a strong note.''

PATRIOTS OFFENSIVE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Ernie Zampese's offense has picked up where
it left off in Dallas. And that isn't good news for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   After New England's first-team offense stumbled in a 14-13 loss
to the 49ers last week at 3Com Park, the performance didn't improve
significantly in the second exhibition game Sunday night against
the Minnesota Vikings, who took a 28-0 win before a quiet 54,111 at
Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Zampese, New England's new offensive coordinator, guided Dallas
last season, and the Cowboys offense ranked 24th in the league.
After two subpar showings, the Patriots are 0-2 and off to their
worst exhibition start since 1993 (Bill Parcells's first year).
They left the field at the half to a chorus of boos. By the end of
the game, there weren't enough fans left to voice much displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week we wanted to do some things. This week they wanted
to work on the timing so we didn't have a game plan like we would
in the regular season,'' said Patriots captain Bruce Armstrong.
``In the preseason games, when they go good they go good and when
they go bad they go bad. It did not look good tonight, but you take
it for what it's worth and you go back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe went 7 for 15 for 74 yards, but of more importance,
was sacked three times by the pumped-up Vikings front line, which
had its way with the Patriots' offensive line. Not only did the
line not pass block well, it didn't run block well either as
neither Sedrick Shaw (eight carries, 13 yards)nor Harold Shaw
(13-22) was able to bust loose. The Patriots ran for just 66 yards
on 24 carries. Derrick Cullors, who rushed only twice, led them
with 24 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure you guys just look at the score but we actually made
some progress,'' said wide receiver Shawn Jefferson. ``We were able
to forward some of the things on our offense and we still have a
lot of time to get things straightened out. There are some timing
things where we have to get open quicker as receivers and I think
that's coming. I know that sounds strange when it's 28-0, but
that's how we feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who took part in 30 plays and sustained a couple of
cuts on his chin, also seemed upbeat, saying progress was made with
Zampese's new quick-striking offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I actually felt like I was in a game,''
Bledsoe said. ``I was sacked a few times and I had to rush some
throws. But I think it was good to experience that. I think it's
going to take some time, but our offense will get there.''
</P>
<P>
   But coach Pete Carroll wasn't so pleased. It may be a tough week
of practice at Bryant College before the team sets out for Mexico
City for an exhibition against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't getting much done,'' said Carroll. ``Obviously, camp
isn't paying off yet. It seems like we make progress in drills but
then when the lights go on, we can't seem to forward that.'' Of the
running game, Carroll said, ``There's not much to assess. We
averaged 2 yards per carry,'' actually 2.8, the same as last week.
</P>
<P>
   A good indicator of the ineffective performance of the line came
midway through the second quarter. On fourth and 1 at the Vikings
38-yard line, Bledsoe handed off to Harold Shaw, who was stuffed
for a 2-yard loss. There was absolutely no push by the line.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll had said during the week that the first team would stay
in the game as long as it took to get something accomplished.
Evidently, Carroll grew impatient as he brought Scott Zolak into
the game with 7:33 left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings drew first blood with 13:01 left in the second
quarter on linebacker Dwayne Rudd's 34-yard return of an
interception that wasn't Bledsoe's fault. Bledsoe threw a perfect
pass to Terry Glenn about 9 yards downfield, but Glenn, who still
hasn't caught a pass this preseason, was rattled by cornerback
Corey Fuller, bobbling the ball into Rudd's hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings scored again on their first possession of the third
quarter, culminating with rookie Randy Moss's 44-yard touchdown
reception over Mark Tate. The pass, delivered by veteran
quarterback Randall Cunningham, was caught by Moss at the 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' second defense, which had played well against the
49ers, looked as if it hadn't even practiced all week. On the
Vikings' second possession of the third quarter, rookie Greg Spires
sacked Cunningham for a 2-yard loss, but the defense couldn't ride
that momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots rookie cornerback Tebucky Jones interfered with Moss on
a sideline pattern for a 14-yard penalty to the 35, and the Vikings
were off and running again. Cunningham connected with running back
Scottie Graham on a swing pass that went for 17 yards when a few
defenders missed tackles.
</P>
<P>
   The drive came to fruition when Cunningham threaded the needle
to tight end Andrew Glover for an 18-yard toss that was caught in
front of strong safety Larry Whigham, making it 21-0.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak, who had a decent game against the 49ers, fell back, going
3 of 10 for 36 yards. Northeastern's Jim Murphy got the call in the
fourth quarter, his first action of the preseason, but he didn't do
much either.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings scored their fourth touchdown in the fourth quarter
when third-stringer Todd Bouman connected with running back Mo
Williams on a 13-yard pass with 9:55 left.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Where have you gone, Marion Butts? Patriot
Nation turns its lonely eyes to you.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots played a home game Sunday night, an exhibition to
be sure, but still their first Foxboro Stadium appearance since
they made the Dolphins cry here last Dec. 28.
</P>
<P>
   New England was trounced by the Minnesota Vikings, 28-0. Let the
speed-dialing begin as the bloodthirsty shut-ins of talk radio take
the long knives to coach Pete Carroll, offensive coordinator Ernie
Zampese, quarterback Drew Bledsoe, and running backs Sedrick and
Harold Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing dramatic happened in Foxborough Sunday night. There was
no ceremonial pregame coin flip featuring Massachusetts House
Speaker Thomas Finneran. There was no pregame traffic jam. There
was no booth selling tickets for The Lilith Fair. There was no
rookie Robert Edwards (groin pull) in the Patriot backfield. There
was no relief from the heat and the bad moon risin' over the ugly
stadium. And naturally, there was no preseason break from the $15
parking fee.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and there was no pulse from the Patriots' first-team
offense. Again. No catches by Terry Glenn. No touchdown drives by
Bledsoe. And no emergence of a go-to running back.
</P>
<P>
   This is where we are supposed to remind you not to worry. Sunday
night's game was only an exhibition and there are three more to be
played before anything counts. The Patriots are instituting
Zampese's new offense and it takes time to get the timing down.
</P>
<P>
   But Carroll admitted, ``It's quite clear we haven't gotten much
done here. Group-wise, we're not moving along here. To be executing
that poorly at this time is unacceptable. Fortunately we have some
preseason games left.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody got that? Don't worry about the fact that the Patriots
were hitless wonders at the end of last season and have thus far
played as if they don't want to stain their trousers for fear the
pants will be sent to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was on the field for only five series of downs. His
first three non-drives resulted in punts. Then came an
interception, which was converted into a 34-yard Vikings touchdown
return. In fairness, the pick wasn't Bledsoe's fault _ Glenn had a
chance to make his first catch of the preseason, but boxed the
ball. Minnesota linebacker Dwayne Rudd picked the pass from the air
and ran home.
</P>
<P>
   In the final Drew drive, the Patriots faced a fourth-and-1 on
the Minnesota 38-yard line and managed to lose 2 yards on a Harold
Shaw run. There were mock cheers when backup Scott Zolak took the
field with 7:22 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to look at it positively, but I think we made some
strides offensively,'' said Bledsoe. ``We're trying to work on our
stuff. Basically, things have to happen faster. It's an offense
that requires a great deal of decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak didn't have much to work with, either. The running game
just wasn't there. The Shaw Twins carried the ball 15 times in the
first half for a combined total of 26 yards. Yeesh. When they were
living, George Bernard Shaw and Clay Shaw could have gained 26
yards on 15 carries. And this comes on the heels of the Candlestick
debacle when the Patriots ran 32 times for 88 yards. Sunday night,
the Patriots ran 24 times for 66 yards and one first down. Good
thing New England's running game is not being held down by that
no-good Curtis Martin anymore.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Patriot fans were patient with the local 11.
Despite the oppresive heat, and inconsiderate (Sunday night!)
timing, Billy Sullivan's Stadium was packed (a live gate of 54,111
with only 6,181 wise no-shows) and most of the loyalists stuck
around after halftime, eager no doubt to see Jim Murphy take a few
snaps. Murph got into the game at the end of the third quarter. The
New England diehards also got to see Minnesota backup wide
receiver, Yo Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, what the fans saw was positively dreadful, but that
is the nature of preseason football. Buyer beware. The NFL
exhibition season is fraudulent by definition. It is intramural
intensity at big league prices.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be interesting to see how long the local patience lasts
while Carroll and Zampese implore the masses to give them a little
more time to get things together.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' next preseason game is in Mexico City. It's always
a good idea to leave the country after a performance like Sunday
night's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to move on from here,'' said Carroll. ``We will. We
have three more weeks to work. We're extremely disappointed with
where we are now. We'll take a look at everything we're doing and
assess why we're not moving along.''
</P>
<P>
   But remember ... it's only preseason. Check out the Red Sox and
come back in four weeks.

Wagner back on mound throwing heat
<TEXT>
<P>
   By ALAN TRUEX &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   With the ninth inning approaching _ his inning _ Billy Wagner
strolled to the bullpen Sunday to warm up. He didn't need much
warming, after the reception the Astrodome crowd gave him.
</P>
<P>
   Astros manager Larry Dierker had found the soft spot he sought _
an 11-2 lead _ to have his game-closing pitcher return from a
near-death experience that was quickly followed by the birth of his
first child.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker wanted the right time to plunge Wagner back into the
surreality of major-league baseball, where a 145-mph comet could
hit him in the head. And did.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a month ago that Wagner's left ear was struck by a
line drive off the bat of little-known Kelly Stinnett. He wasn't
seriously harmed, but it was a matter of inches _ like, 1{.
</P>
<P>
   It was such a dramatic, shocking scene _ Wagner dropping as if
shot in the temple, writhing on the ground _ the networks couldn't
show it enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I woke up in the hospital, that was the first thing I
saw. It didn't bother me to see a ball go off my head. It's just
something that happened. It's rare, but it happened. I'm not going
to make more out of it than it really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Far more important to him was the birth of William James Wagner,
which came as he was about to begin a short rehabilitation
assignment in Jackson, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't got hit in the head I wouldn't have seen my baby's
birth announced on ESPN. Sarah did a lot of things with him that I
wanted to do, like hold him. Since I got back, I haven't done
nothing but hold him.''
</P>
<P>
   So after he had a torn ear, a hospital stay, a birthday (July
25, his 27th), a son born and three shutout innings in Jackson,
Wagner finally would pitch again, against a major-league team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throwing in the bullpen, it was a little hard at times because
of the cheering. I was all over the place with my pitches. And then
I said to myself, `Who cares? Just throw it down the middle.'''
</P>
<P>
   With his sense of perspective intact, he sprinted to the
pitcher's mound in the middle of the stadium, buoyed by a standing
ovation from the 28,000-plus in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do the same routine I always do. When I got out on
the mound I said the same prayer I always do. I thanked the Lord
for letting me have the opportunity to play in the game. A lot of
people were worried about me. I know the front office was a little
insecure about putting me in a situation where I had to get a
save.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Wagner long to reassure everyone. The first of
the Philadelphia Phillies to face him was a muscular young catcher,
Bobby Estalella, who the night before had pumped Jose Lima and Doug
Henry fastballs into the outfield stands.
</P>
<P>
   Estalella went down swinging at Wagner's fifth straight
fastball. Jon Zuber doubled to left field on a pitch reported at 98
mph on the Dome scoreboard. Wagner recovered to retire pinch hitter
Ruben Amaro on a medium-deep fly ball to center field.
</P>
<P>
   When the heat reached 100 on a pitch to Doug Glanville, another
round of cheers swept through the Dome from the standing-again
crowd. Glanville flied out to right on a 1-2 pitch, game over.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Wagner tried to minimize his significance:
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a letter from a Little League pitcher who was hit by a
line drive and went into a coma. He wrote me and said he would be
back playing again in two weeks. As adults, we worry about
everything, and with something like that, we tend to get panicky.
But when I read that letter, it got a load off my shoulders. I
realized my accident wasn't nearly as serious as his. Now it's back
to business. I'm back throwing, doing what I'm supposed to do.''

POSITIVE NEWS ON PATRIOTS ROOKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ On a night when debates were raging whether
these Patriots looked more like a Rod Rust team or a Dick
MacPherson team _ no running, no blocking, no passing, no points,
and many a missed tackle by the second- and third-team defenses _
the only happy news for Patriots fans came in the locker room a
half hour after Sunday's game had mercifully ended.
</P>
<P>
   Tebucky Jones was smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it happened, I thought it was my knee,'' said the rookie
defensive back, who went down 1:58 into the fourth quarter of a
28-0 exhibition loss to the Vikings with what appeared to be a
possibly serious leg injury. ``That's why I flipped sideways when I
was in the air, and when I landed I thought I might be hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Words failed Jones when he tried to describe that split second
when he was in the air and he felt pain in his left leg and then
his left foot. ``I don't know what I was thinking,'' he said. ``I
just laid down.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the second of the Patriots' two first-round picks in the
draft, was on the punt coverage team when he collided with a
Vikings blocker and went flying through the air. After coming to
rest on the turf, he sat there for several minutes, being tended by
team doctors, until finally he was able to walk to the sideline,
albeit gingerly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to walk off on my own,'' said Jones, ``and when I came
to the sideline, sat down, and calmed down a bit, I tried to start
walking again on my own. And when I walked on my own, it seemed to
go away a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury was termed a strained left foot, and the rookie said
there also was some pain in his ankle. ``I think it'll be OK,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had been brought gradually into the game, playing only in
dime and nickel packages in the first quarter, but more and more as
the game wore on, often finding himself opposite the Vikings'
prized rookie receiver, Randy Moss. Jones was called for
interference on Moss on one play but did not allow Moss to catch
any balls on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hear that hype (about Moss's skills), it only makes me
want to go out there and play more,'' said Jones. ``He put a couple
of shakes on me, but I was on him, though.'' Moss may be quick,
said Jones, ``but I'm quick, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss didn't do much talking to Jones ``and I didn't do talkin'
to him,'' said Jones. ``I just go out there and play. I don't need
to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he would have liked to have had a chance to go
against Minnesota's top receiver and one of the NFL's best, Cris
Carter. ``But Carter was on the other side from me,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, said Jones after his second NFL experience, ``I feel
I'm getting better and better. I'm feeling more comfortable (at
cornerback), but there's a lot of running to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lopsided score, the Patriots' starting defense
played well. (With this offense, it may have to play more than
well.) But the defenders were disturbed by the team's overall
performance. Safety Lawyer Milloy said, ``We got our butts
whipped.'' Added defensive back Larry Whigham, ``No concern now,
because it's early, but if we're like this in a week or two, then
it's a whole lot of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a sliver or two of bright light _ beyond Jones not
being seriously hurt. Tackle Bruce Armstrong said ``it felt good,''
after playing with a brace on his injured left leg, and rookie
defensive lineman Greg Spires had two sacks, including one on which
he chased down Minnesota backup quarterback Randall Cunningham from
clear across the field before bringing him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a tough week at practice, so it felt good to feel my
legs back under me a bit again,'' said Spires, who showed off his
speed in his pass rush. On the chase down of Cunningham, he said,
``I saw it was a play-action and all of a sudden I was around the
tackle and when I looked up, Cunningham was about 10 yards from me.
So I went running and I kept running and we must have had good
coverage downfield for me to get a sack like that.''
</P>
<P>
   That play, said Spires, epitomizes his motto for playing
football: ``Just keep the motor running. I kept the motor running
and I was able to get Cunningham. Good things happen when I keep
running and hustle around. The play's not over till it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Two sacks or no two sacks, Spires said he would grade himself at
``B-minus'' for the game. ``I'm just trying to get comfortable
around here and play as hard as I can,'' said Spires, ``but it's
like starting all over again. But I'd give all the sacks back,
because I wish we had won the game.''

PATRIOTS HAVEN'T HIT GROUND RUNNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ When it comes to preseason, all opinions
are subject to change without notice, but in case you didn't notice
Sunday night the Patriots looked like a team that couldn't run to
the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Martin is long gone but not yet forgotten because in two
games the Patriots have run the ball like a team whose shoes were
designed by Al Capone. Cement brogans with laces seem in vogue
these days and people are beginning to notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy they have to worry about (replacing) isn't Jimmy
Hitchcock,'' said Jimmy Hitchcock, the former Patriot cornerback
who was traded to Minnesota last spring. ``I'm a passerby. It's
Curtis Martin. He's the one they have to worry about and it's
showing already. They got the draft picks for him but, hey, what
have they done yet?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the first of them, No. 1 pick Robert Edwards carried six
times for 20 yards a week ago and no times for no yards Sunday
night because his oft-injured body was a no go because of a sore
groin. This is not necessarily a problem because this is the season
of sore groins and pulled hamstrings with training camp's drudgery
only about half finished. But when you have had a broken foot,
ankle problems, and a knee injury in college, you give people cause
to wonder about your fragility when you come into the NFL and are
limping less than a month into your rookie year.
</P>
<P>
   And so Sunday night you wondered.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Sedrick Shaw, The First Annual Bill Parcells
Replacement Pick of two years ago who was taken on the third round
out of Iowa. Sunday night he ran for an average of 1.6 yards a
carry. What that means is if there were seven downs instead of four
and the Patriots gave the ball to Sedrick Shaw on six plays, they
still would have had to punt on the seventh play.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Shaw didn't handle the ball until Martin was put in
traction as the playoffs approached. He then carried 10 times for
22 yards in the postseason, but those numbers have been hyped to
the point where one might conclude it was 122 yards on 10 carries.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Shaw won't one day be the back who rushed for
4,156 yards at Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday night you wondered.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an attempt to be harsh. After all, it is still
early. But how could the Minnesota Vikings be playing their first
exhibition game of the summer and look four touchdowns better than
a team that was not only playing its second exhibition game of the
summer but had also promised to keep its offense out there ``until
they accomplished something''?
</P>
<P>
   Had head coach Pete Carroll stuck to his guns on that, the
offense would be playing as you're reading this but the Vikings
declined to stay around until Monday night. That being the case,
let's move along to this year's sixth-round choice, one Harold
Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Missives from Smithfield have contended all summer that Shaw is
a little bit like Earl Campbell. Straight-ahead runner, they said.
Power personified, they said. Out of the Jerome Bettis mold, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, who stole the kid's uniform Sunday night and wore it
against the Vikings?
</P>
<P>
   Harold Shaw averaged 1.7 yards per battering Sunday night while
he was out there, which admittedly was better than Sedrick but it
reminded no one of Earl Campbell. Not unless we're talking about
Earl's present condition, which people in Texas tell me would be
considered round now that he's a decade into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Again, in the interest of fairness, let me point out that it is
still August and not football weather and the offense is still
adjusting and yada yada yada ... but let's get serious for a minute
if you can stand it. What you saw Sunday night when the Patriots
tried to run the ball was obvious. It was pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   You saw a line get no push and runners make no one miss. You saw
a running game that would have been overrated if it was called a
walking game. This is not good, even in mid-August, as people like
Hitchcock know all too well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, the year we went to the Super Bowl, we went down and
beat Dallas, 31-7, (in preseason),'' Hitchcock recalled. ``We were
coming off the field and (Bill) Parcells turned to an assistant
coach and said, `That team's in trouble.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a parallel here. Maybe there's a touchdown difference
but I'm saying the Patriots are in the same situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots fans were assured all spring and summer not to worry
about the absent Martin because computer experts in the employ of
Robert Kraft had done voluminous studies and system analysis on the
running back position and it was concluded your Aunt Minnie could
play it at least as well as Curtis Martin.
</P>
<P>
   One day he was one of the five best backs in football. Next day
_ which just happened to be the day after he signed with the hated
Jets _ he was as easy to replace as a bathroom plunger.
</P>
<P>
   You can always find a back, Kraft was told.
</P>
<P>
   It's the easiest position to fill, Kraft was told.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody with two legs can come in and play running back, Kraft
was told.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if that's the case why did it take the Patriots 30 years
to find a replacement for Jim Nance?
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night you wondered about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Now this may all be just a midsummer night's panic. Robert
Edwards may get healthy by fall and run like the best back in
Georgia since Herschel Walker left. Or the Runners Shaw may soon
stop looking like George Bernard Shaw with a football and begin to
resemble ... well I can't think of a guy named Shaw who was a great
running back but maybe one of them will become the first.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are still three exhibition games and a month of
practices left before the real McCoy against the Denver Broncos.
That's plenty of time to get running, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   After all, you can always find a running back.
</P>
<P>
   It's the easiest position to fill.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody with two legs can do it.
</P>
<P>
   Can't they?
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, you began to wonder about that, too.

YUGOSLAVIA ON TOP OF WORLDS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ Sitting atop the shoulders of a flag-draped supporter,
Yugoslavian guard Aleksandr Djordjevic kissed his jersey and waved
to his supporters, two of whom were holding aloft flares in the
delirious Yugoslavian cheering section.
</P>
<P>
   Earth has a new official men's basketball world champion, and it
is Yugoslavia, 64-62 conquerors of Russia in a game that gave new
meaning to the word ``passionate''.
</P>
<P>
   Take Duke-North Carolina, add centuries-old nationalistic
fervor, put great athletes on the floor, and you had the
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have no idea _ none _ about the nature of these
competitions. Five minutes after the game was over, the losing fans
were still singing their songs and cheering their side. It was an
extension of something that had begun 25 minutes before the game
even started, and which continued unabated throughout the tense
contest. Oh, and mix in the Greek fans, denied even a bronze, but
still the hosts, singing and chanting their stuff, and you had a
sensational climax to a tournament which, by the time of its
conclusion, had forgotten that the NBA even exists.
</P>
<P>
   So was the 1998 championship a success? If you're a Yugoslavian,
of course, you think it was a success. You did very well. If you're
the Greek organizers, you're extremely grateful your home team made
the medal round, thus ensuring enthusiastic capacity crowds for the
final three days of a tournament that was all-too-often
distinguished in the first week by the sorry sight of empty seats
for any game in which Greece was not a participant. In the end, the
absence of the NBA stars didn't affect the attendance as much as it
could have had the Greeks not remained in contention for a medal.
</P>
<P>
   The most unhappy man concerning the lack of American stars is,
as always, Borislav Stankovic, the Secretary General of FIBA, the
international basketball governing body. He was more responsible
for the formation of the original Dream Team than anybody, because
he believed the only way for the rest of the world to catch up to
the US in his beloved sport (he actually participated in the first
Worlds 48 years ago in Buenos Aires) was for them to breathe the
monster's fire, and he had the clout to get it done, in part due to
his relationship with key Americans such as David Stern and Dave
Gavitt.
</P>
<P>
   So while Yugoslavia can exult about being the current world
champions, Stankovic knows where the real power lies and he sees
his timetable being put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, the US came to international competitions
with college and AAU players and they were able to win
everything,'' Stankovic said. ``Then, as time went on, they would
come with those players and they would lose, lose, lose. We brought
the NBA stars to Barcelona and they won by 40 points. But by
Atlanta there were more competitive games. I do not think the
difference will be so big in years to come. That's my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   But the gap can only be closed by head-to-head competition.
Beating Rudy T's collection of CBA, European, and college players
was no big deal. The big story would have been if the US had
prevailed with such a team. And that brings FIBA folk to another
matter ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't understand why the quality of the tournament
should be judged just on one team,'' said Florian Wanninger, the
longtime head of FIBA press affairs. ``Everyone talked about the
absence of the NBA players, but no one questioned the absence of
Yugoslavian players. We felt a little unnerved.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true. Yugoslavia did well enough without Vlade Divac,
Predrag Danilovic, Zoran Savic, and Zarko Paspalj as it was. With
them, there would have been no question.
</P>
<P>
   Only someone more conversant with international basketball would
be able to critique adequately the quality of play as opposed to
other international tournaments, but let there be no question that
there are very good teams and players all over the globe. Even a
team such as South Korea, which went home winless, is an
entertaining, intelligent squad. Its center, Jang-Hoon Seo, is a
clever 6-foot-10-inch 24-year-old who must have had someone send
him some Kevin McHale tapes. He has a sneaky up-and-under move and
he handles himself very well around the basket in general. He would
enhance any number of Division 1 college teams.
</P>
<P>
   Senegal and Nigeria were loaded with American college players.
Lithuania, which peaked by beating the US, has a thoroughly likable
and skilled team. Spain, which has made little noise since picking
up the silver 14 years ago in Los Angeles, had a very competitive
team featuring forward Alberto Herreros.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina has a pair of quality big men in Marcelo Nicola and
the elegantly-named Fabricio Oberto, as well as a veteran guard
named Juan Espil, who attracted American attention as far back as
the 1992 Tournament of the Americas. The Argentines will not be
easy for any second-echelon American team to defeat when qualifying
time for Sydney rolls around in less than two years.
</P>
<P>
   There is much to be said for the actual game they play. Forty
minutes a game means that lengthy days of quadruple and sextuple
headers can roll by. But it's more than that. It's just basketball.
With the exception of Greece, a deliberate team, everyone else
looks to run. Fast breaks are a dying art in America, but they
weren't over here.
</P>
<P>
   There are fewer timeouts _ the final two minutes feel like two
minutes, not two months _ and there is no television intrusion. The
overall pace is better than ours. And in blessed contrast to the
wretched entertainment excess of the ever-bloated NBA, there are no
assaults on the senses. No dancing girls. No blaring music during
timeouts. No sound effects during the game. It's just basketball,
and that means basketball as it used to be and ought to be. The
only extras are spontaneous crowd noise. What a fascinating
concept, huh?
</P>
<P>
   What we definitely know is that only experienced American
professionals can win a tournament like this. You can't fully grasp
it until you see it, because seeing an isolated international in an
NBA uniform doesn't reveal what he's like on his national team,
with his friends, playing his rules for his purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international players perform so much better over here,''
maintains Lakers head coach and Team USA assistant Del Harris.
``They're playing their game in their surroundings. There's a
definite comfort level. Take a guy like (Australia's) Shane Heal.
He couldn't do anything when he played with the Timberwolves. But
in this game he's a great player.'' As proof, Heal lit up the US
for 31.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever the internationals are capable of, it will be on
full display here. ``You see a guy in his regular Spanish or
Italian League,'' says one American scout, ``and he might take a
night off. They don't take any nights off when they're playing for
their country.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament is coming to Indianapolis in 2002, and this is
what you can expect: picture the NCAA tournament encapsulated into
nine days with international fans and flags and noisemakers. If
that sounds good, then perhaps you should check it out.

GOMEZ BREAKS THROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
 PCS TOURNEY-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ The first two sets of Sunday's Sprint PCS
final couldn't have been much closer, with only two service breaks
_ one each by Andres Gomez and Henri Leconte.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the first-to-10 tiebreaker to decide the championship,
that all changed. From the start, it seemed something was wrong
with Leconte, who has had three back operations. Gomez won the
first point when Leconte's forehand up the line went into the net.
Three Leconte double faults later, Gomez led, 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez won the longest match of the five-day event (2 hours 8
minutes), 7-5, 4-6, 10-3, and in so doing moved from sixth to
second on the Nuveen Tour, for players 35 and older. The win, worth
$40,000, was the 10th senior victory for Gomez, more than anyone
except Jimmy Connors, who defaulted in the semifinals with a foot
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Leconte, who defeated Gomez in four of five meetings on the
regular men's tour, earned $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez didn't know until the middle of the tiebreaker that there
was anything wrong with Leconte's back. ``I was just thinking about
my game,'' said Gomez, the 1990 French Open champion. ``I didn't
think about his game too much. It's more difficult to play someone
when you see he might not be moving that well. I didn't want to
push the ball whether he had a bad back, a good back, or any kind
of back.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after Gomez went in front, 6-1, when Leconte's backhand
crosscourt found the net, Leconte was on his back in the corner of
the court, trying to stretch out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have different exercises for my back and it worked, my back
popped back in,'' said Leconte. ``I have an old back. I'm 35 and my
back is 65. I just couldn't serve. On my toss ... well, I can't say
the word.''
</P>
<P>
   There were seven minibreaks in the tiebreaker, Gomez winning
five, the last when a Leconte forehand up the line went into the
net. That gave Gomez an 8-2 edge, but he was still worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the 10-point tiebreaker, but the fans like it.
It's hard to enjoy,'' said Gomez. ``I've seen someone up, 9-2, and
he lost 10 straight points. It's a situation you're not used to. In
a seven-point tiebreak, you can be up, 5-1, and you pretty much
have the game in control, but here in a 10-point tiebreak, you're
up, 7-2, and you don't know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez won the first set in the 12th game, getting to 30-40 on
Leconte's serve with a backhand crosser for the winner, followed by
a Leconte backhand mishit. In the first game of the second set, on
Gomez's serve, Leconte was up, 0-40, taking it on a backhand Gomez
popped into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez has a history of playing well in Massachusetts. He won six
Longwood championships, three in singles and three in doubles. And
he won a senior singles title in 1995 at Mashpee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here,'' Gomez said. ``I feel comfortable here and it
helps my game. Plus, you know your way around without asking for
directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting the winner's check makes you want to return.
</P>
<P>
   In the doubles final, John Fitzgerald and Shlomo Glickstein
defeated top seeds Hank Pfister and Tim Wilkison, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3,
11-9.

KILROY'S STORIES GO ON AND ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It was a half-hour before Sunday night's
Patriots exhibition game and Bucko Kilroy, a consultant to the
Patriots and one of the most familiar faces at Foxboro Stadium,
already was in his seat. Ready for another season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bucko,'' Kilroy was asked, ``how many years in pro football
does this make for you?''
</P>
<P>
   Kilroy, 77, paused. Paused some more. And finally came back with
the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-six years,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anyone still in pro football who has seen more seasons?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well ... I guess Wellington (Mara, the co-owner of the New
York Giants),'' replied Kilroy, the longtime Patriots executive.
``We came in the same year _ 1943.''
</P>
<P>
   And then came the stories, and then came the tales, and then
came the memories from a man who played both ways for the
Philadelphia Eagles (as did virtually all players) in the 1940s and
1950s, a man who coached, a man who was a general manager, a man
who has seen pro football grow from virtually nothing into
America's most dominant sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otto Graham,'' Kilroy replied almost instantly, when asked who
was the best quarterback he had seen. ``He was the best but what
hurts Otto is that (Paul Brown, Graham's coach with the Cleveland
Browns) called all the plays for him, so that's always held against
Otto. But it shouldn't be because Otto was so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Which immediately led into another tale, Kilroy laughing his
familiar small laugh, saying, ``But I once picked off Otto twice in
one game, two interceptions. And you know why? Because I was the
guy calling the defensive signals _ none of that stuff about calls
coming from the coaches on the sidelines, I did the calls _ and I
put myself where I could pick off Otto's passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Which led into yet another tale because Kilroy's Philadelphia
Eagles were the best in the NFL in the late 1940s while Brown's
Cleveland Browns were kings of the All-American Football
Conference, and the teams met after the 1949 and 1950 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat us (in 1950) in Cleveland but we didn't have our
best guy playing,'' recalled Kilroy. ``Steve Van Buren (the best
runner in the NFL in that era) was hurt and that really stopped
us.''
</P>
<P>
   In front of Kilroy as he talked was the program for Sunday
night's game between the Patriots and Vikings. On the cover were
pictures of this year's inductees into the Pro Football Hall of
Fame in Canton, Ohio, and Kilroy pointed to two of the pictures _
Tommy McDonald and Paul Krause _ and said, ``I drafted those guys,
both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald was a brilliant receiver for the Eagles whom Kilroy
drafted for Philadelphia in 1957, and Krause was a defensive back
for the Redskins from 1964 through 1967 _ when Kilroy called the
shots there _ and later moved on for 12 brilliant years with the
Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Kilroy played on the offensive line for Philadelphia, and at
linebacker and on the line on defense, and, even to this day,
Kilroy's reputation as a dirty player is still alive. ``Aww,'' said
Kilroy, ``Ed Sprinkle (of the Chicago Bears) was the dirty guy. He
was really tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, led into another tale when Look magazine
carried an article in the early 1950s, naming Kilroy as football's
dirtiest player, ``but I sued them and I won the case, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilroy looks at the pro football of the last generation, with
specialists upon specialists and mass substitutions by downs and
says, naturally, it was a far different sport when he played and
there were few substitutions. ``Players had to be tough, really
tough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the toughest of them all? His teammate with the Eagles,
linebacker Chuck Bednarik?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Bednarik was tough, said Kilroy, ``but the really tough guy
was Hardy Brown of the 49ers. He was a small guy but he could just
explode off the line _ he was a defensive lineman _ and I remember
the way he would crouch down and just come up on people.''
</P>
<P>
   And tale after tale. Kilroy replied almost instantly when asked
who was the best passer he ever saw _ ``Sammy Baugh'' of the
Redskins of the early 1940s _ but he also threw in names such as
Sonny Jurgensen of the Redskins and Eagles in the 1950s and 1960s,
and Sid Luckman of the Bears of the '40s, and Norm Van Brocklin and
Bob Waterfield of the Rams of the 1940s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   But the best quarterback? ``Otto Graham,'' he said again. ``The
guy still is probably one of the most productive passers in history
and what people forget is what such a great athlete he was. Otto
Graham could do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   And tales went on and on, Kilroy disputing the common belief
that Frankie Albert and the San Francisco 49ers of the 1940s were
the first to use the T-formation in pro football. ``You know who
was first? George Halas had it first with the Bears and we were
second with the `T' with the Eagles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tales went on and on. And Kilroy's words could not be taken
lightly. He has seen it all.

REVOLUTION DEFENSE HAS NO CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Revolution's mantra in recent weeks has been that
their situation could not get worse. But during a 6-1 defeat in
Columbus Saturday, they sank to another low.
</P>
<P>
   After 24 games, the Revolution have 19 points, their lowest
total in three seasons of Major League Soccer. With a quarter of
the regular season remaining, they are on a pace to earn 25 points,
which would be 8 less than in their inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Revolution remain in playoff contention since all but
two teams in each conference qualify for postseason play. A
regulation-time victory at Tampa Friday would lift the Revolution
out of last place in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution did not resemble a team with much winning
potential against Columbus. They seemed more like a team that is
fading fast, with few solutions to some serious problems,
especially on defense.
</P>
<P>
   They are hoping to make a trade and to add Jair (broken left
ankle) to the midfield by the Aug. 22 game against Los Angeles. It
might be too much to expect those moves to salvage a dismal season.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution's defense was especially ineffective against the
Crew, which were sparked by Andy Williams, a Jamaican midfielder
who studied business at the University of Rhode Island and hoped to
join the New England team. They now have surrendered 54 goals,
worst in the league and only two fewer than they gave up in '96.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus game was the first this season in which the
Revolution completely collapsed. The Crew were playing well and had
the home-field advantage, but the Revolution simply lost their
poise. It was apparent early that New England was fighting an
uphill battle, but instead of being resourceful, the Revolution
self-destructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were motivated, we knew it was an important game,''
midfielder/sweeper Edwin Gorter said. ``They scored a fantastic
goal, then two corners and it was 3-0 and the game was over. On
this field especially, Columbus is very good, and if they are ahead
by three goals it is hard for any team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were prepared for corners but these guys got some fantastic
headers. Those were strong goals, and after that the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a spanking, but maybe it was a spanking at the right
moment. Now we have to respond and we will do that Friday in Tampa
Bay. This was bad and we know it. Now we have two games left with
Tampa Bay and Miami and we have to win them. We are not happy about
this game. But it is better to lose once, 6-1, than to lose four
times, 2-0.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution have now lost so many games in so many ways
that losing has become expected. This was a stigma that coach
Thomas Rongen had hoped to overcome, but his moves so far have
failed.
</P>
<P>
   With 89 points in 90 MLS matches, the Revolution have the worst
record among the league's original 10 teams. Rongen's position was
precarious before a 3-0 victory over San Jose Wednesday, but
general manager Brian O'Donovan remained encouraged by that win and
a second-half rally for a 3-1 win over Dallas July 18.
</P>
<P>
   But will O'Donovan be similarly discouraged by the Columbus
rout?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jamar Beasley is scheduled to join the Revolution after helping
the US defeat Trinidad and Tobago, 6-1,  &UR; yesterday &LR;  in
Port-of-Spain to qualify for the Under-20 World Cup, scheduled
April 3-24 in Nigeria.

   1. DIGGING UP DIRT ON PRESIDENT CLINTON'S ENEMIES Terry Lenzner
once served a Watergate subpoena on Richard Nixon. Now, as head of
an elite group of private investigators, he is digging up dirt on
President Clinton's enemies - among them, Paula Jones. By David
Samuels. From The New York Times Magazine. 2,500 words. 2. RAYMOND
CARVER AND HIS (HYPERACTIVE) EDITOR Ten years after the death of
Raymond Carver, new disclosures about the influence of his editor,
Gordon Lish, are casting a strange light on some of the most
revered short stories in America's literary tradition. By D.T. Max.
From The New York Times Magazine. 3,000 words.

``DO THE NURSES DO THE SURGERY HERE?'' -- WOMEN IN
</P>
<P>
   THE OPERATING ROOM No area of medicine is as dominated by men as
surgery. Although half of medical students are now women, women
remain a rarity in operating rooms. Why are there so few women
surgeons? From Der Spiegel. 1,000 words. (English translation
available.)
_______________________________________________________________ 4.
'EVIDENCE' OF A PROMISING DIGITAL ARTIST In the web-based artwork
``Evidence : Meditations on Small Objects,'' Polish-born artist
Maya Drozdz is guilty - to great effect - of violating some of the
accepted precepts of how tales are told on the Internet. The
multimedia short story plays out in a pop-up window that covers
about a third of the monitor screen. Clicking on highlighted words
and images reveals additional information, and a narrative-like
chronology begins to take shape. ``Evidence'' departs in several
ways from the conventions of electronic storytelling on the Web. By
Matthew Mirapaul. From New York Times CyberTimes. 1,000 words. 5.
IT'S NO TIME TO FORSAKE DEMOCRACY IN AFRICA The ``new'' capitalist
and undemocratic regimes in Africa are not so new, not so stable.
Democracy and economic development must go hand in hand. By Joel D.
Barkan and David F. Gordon. From Foreign Affairs magazine. 1,500
words.

   6. WHAT'S DOING IN VIENNA Tips on events, sightseeing, hotels
and restaurants in Vienna. (The effects of the opening up of the
former Communist bloc can be subtly felt in the languages spoken in
the cafes and on the trams, and in glimpses of newly affluent
Russians who park money here.) By Jane Perlez. New York Times Way
To Go! 1,500 words + photos
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
RALPH REED IS HIS CROSS TO BEAR Randy Tate has been head of the
Christian Coalition in the United States for a year, but
conservatives still pine for his media-savvy predecessor, Ralph
Reed. Now Tate is finally getting attention for an issue Reed says
is a loser : homosexuality. By Melinda Henneberger. From The New
York Times Magazine. 2,000 words.

   A. Satellite Climate Record In Error A record of cooling in the
lowest layer of the atmosphere seems to have more to do with
changes in the orbits of the satellites making the measurements,
than any real climatic effect. Once these changes are accounted
for, the trend turns from a cooling to a modest warming trend. This
conclusion is likely to be controversial. By Henry Gee. 1,200
words.

   B. Secret Life Of A Blood Clot Given that the majority of heart
attacks and strokes are triggered by platelet-dependent blood
clotting (thrombosis,) the discovery this week of a previously

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Illogical air fares
 &HT;    (For release Aug. 12, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The absurdity of myriad airline fares cannot be more
graphic than in the rates at least one airline charges to fly to
Atlanta from two South Florida cities. Likely, similar situations
exist in other areas, on other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   A friend told me the other day that to fly round-trip from Miami
to Atlanta costs $600 more than it does to fly from Fort Lauderdale
to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Miami and Fort Lauderdale are about 25 miles apart.
</P>
<P>
   After telling the friend he must be smoking something funny, I
decided to call the airline, Delta _ just to be certain.
</P>
<P>
   To my great surprise, the friend was right.
</P>
<P>
   To fly from Miami to Atlanta on Oct. 1 and return on Oct. 3
would cost me $862.12, according to the reservations specialist at
Delta. But to fly from Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta on Oct. 1 and
return on Oct. 3 will cost only $246.82.
</P>
<P>
   The difference: $615.30, or enough to make a fall-season round
trip from the East Coast of the United States to many points in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why such a difference?'' I inquired of the Delta person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because your trip from Miami didn't include a Saturday night
stay in Atlanta,'' she answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flight from Fort Lauderdale did not include Saturday
night, either,'' I responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true,'' she said, ``but the Fort Lauderdale flight does
not require Saturday night; Miami does.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see,'' I continued the exercise, ``Oct. 3 is a Saturday.
So if I stay over in an Atlanta hotel Saturday night and fly home
to Miami on Sunday, what's the fare?''
</P>
<P>
   ``$166.55.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Say that again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``$166.55.''
</P>
<P>
   The stay of one extra night in Atlanta would save me $695.57 in
air fare, she was telling me. I presume I could get a pretty good
room in Atlanta for that amount. And a pretty good dinner too. And
maybe a show. And some champagne. And a ticket to a Braves game.
</P>
<P>
   This was something I had to double-check, so I turned on my
computer and went to Delta Air Lines Skylinks Web Page. And there
it was: $862.12, round-trip, Miami to Atlanta, leaving 9:05 a.m.
Oct. 1, returning 9:40 a.m. Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   But the comparable flight from Fort Lauderdale was not $246.82,
as the phone representative told me. It was only $146.75. That made
it $715.37 less to hop up the road a bit and fly from Fort
Lauderdale!
</P>
<P>
   Some starched shirt at Delta, I am certain, would have an
explanation for this vast difference but it would be
incomprehensible to me, and to any other traveler.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, Atlanta is not on my destination list, but were it,
and I was living in Miami, as I do, I suppose I would either decide
to spend a Saturday night in Atlanta, even though I didn't have any
other reason to, or hire a stretch limousine, make certain it was
stocked with Diet Dr Pepper and Cheez Doodles and wend my way up
Interstate 95 the short distance to Fort Lauderdale International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   And if I looked real hard, I'll bet I could find someone else,
coming down the road from Fort Lauderdale to Miami to board some
other flight that was equally unequally priced to a different
destination.
</P>
<P>
   The free market zips past in both directions.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Clinton's approval ratings rise
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Members of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
grand jury now have heard sworn testimony from ``that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how events unfold, Monica Lewinsky's grand jury
testimony could lead to President Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   While it's Clinton who could be charged with various felonies,
Americans think Starr is a bum, Lewinsky is a hussy and Clinton
hung the moon.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lewinsky scandal broke in January with allegations that
Clinton committed criminal perjury, obstruction of justice,
subornation of witnesses and trashy behavior, his approval ratings
went up.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewinsky agreed to testify with a grant of immunity for any
crimes she may have committed with Clinton, the president's
approval ratings went up again.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the possibility that DNA evidence could show that
Clinton committed criminal perjury, an ABC News poll just before
Lewinsky's grand jury appearance showed Clinton's approval ratings
continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Americans in those polls must believe that Clinton is being
hounded for nothing more than his charming inability to say no to a
sweet young thing. Besides, what's wrong with a few lies about a
bit of hanky panky between consenting adults?
</P>
<P>
   That's the moral view of the Lewinsky sexcapade, which
unfortunately makes the French look like sexual prudes compared to
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be the sex that prevents Americans from seeing the
Lewinsky affair as a serious matter of law.
</P>
<P>
   America's revolution established a new nation based on the rule
of law with the explicit provision that no citizen is above the
law. All schoolchildren should know this basic American principle.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton especially should have no trouble understanding this
principle. After all, he's a lawyer and a former law professor who
placed his hand on the Bible and swore a solemn oath to preserve,
protect and defend the Constitution and to see that the laws are
``faithfully executed.''
</P>
<P>
   In sworn testimony in the the Paula Jones lawsuit, Clinton
admitted that he broke his wedding vows and lied to the American
people. The Starr grand jurors don't care about that.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jurors will care, however, if they believe Clinton
violated his solemn oath to faithfully execute the laws of the
United States by committing criminal perjury, encouraging others to
commit perjury or attempting to obstruct justice. All Americans
should care.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton supporters buy the White House spin that all the
president's troubles are the fault of an ``out-of-control''
independent prosecutor who hasn't produced diddly squat after
spending years and millions of dollars. They should recall that
Clinton called for the appointment of an independent counsel to
investigate Whitewater allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has attempted to block Starr's investigation every step
of the way. White House operatives have demonized Starr as though
the outcome of the investigation can be controlled by popularity
polls.
</P>
<P>
   If Starr were out of control, Attorney General Janet Reno could
fire him. That's the law. Under the independent counsel law, all
Reno needs to fire Starr is ``good cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The Whitewater investigation has been the opposite of ``out of
control.'' It has been painstaking, plodding and mind-numbing, but
not out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Whitewater also has not been a dry hole. Starr's probe has
produced 12 guilty pleas and three convictions in trials.
</P>
<P>
   If Starr's final report to Congress includes credible evidence
that Clinton willfully broke the law, surely Clinton's approval
ratings will drop. If not, America's rule of law is in jeopardy.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Attacks on Reno are political strategy
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's one real issue and a lot of partisan fog in the reckless
decision of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee to
cite Attorney General Janet Reno for contempt of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue is whether Reno should appoint another special
counsel, a la Kenneth Starr, this time to investigate Democratic
and Clinton-campaign fund-raising in the last election. It was in
hopes of maneuvering the attorney general into a corner that the
committee ordered Reno to turn over memos from two key subordinates
arguing for such an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The memos apparently do strengthen the case for an independent
counsel _ but strengthening is not the same as cinching and others
in the Justice Department argue the evidence doesn't, or doesn't
yet, animate the independent counsel law. Reno is right to withhold
the memos in any event.
</P>
<P>
   The authors themselves _FBI Director Louis Freeh and Charles
LaBella, who recently left Justice after heading its
campaign-finance task force _ urged the committee not to demand
their memos. The inevitable leaks _ and Chairman Dan Burton's
committee leaks like a geyser _ would compromise current Justice
Department investigations and vastly complicate the job of any
independent counsel, should Reno decide for one.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a committee that says it wants a stronger
investigation undermine the very investigation it says it wants?
Because the GOP majority is more interested in siccing another
go-for-broke prosecutor on the Clinton administration than in any
product a counsel might deliver.
</P>
<P>
   The committee vote was along party lines, and small wonder. The
committee's own investigation has been nakedly partisan, in the
manner of its chairman's manifest zealotry.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are beginning to fear their long war on President
Clinton just might force him out after all, putting Al Gore in
place to seek the presidency in 2000 as the incumbent. The public
would kick if a new independent counsel were set on Gore right
after he was sworn in, but if a counsel was already in place, Gore
could be molested through the election without public backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that extruded scenario doesn't play out, the appointment
of an independent counsel would leave the Justice Department itself
investigating only GOP financial machinations, allowing Republicans
to charge partisanship and discount any findings as biased and
retaliatory.
</P>
<P>
   And at a minimum, the appointment would make potential
Democratic contributors even more skittish than they already have
been made by open-ended investigation. Despite Clinton's frequent
and sometimes unseemly fund-raising, Republicans at last count were
out-drawing Democrats $147 million to $84 million.
</P>
<P>
   The '96 elections resorted to funding extremes, some illegal and
more appallingly lawful. The larger fault rests with Democrats,
even though they were the lesser spenders, but the abuses were
bipartisan. This latest ploy by Burton's committee is one more step
in trivializing what ought to be a national scandal by reducing the
response to partisan gamesmanship.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 9, moved Saturday in the `a' category and are
repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-REVIEW _ The mystifying nature of that chicken-or-egg
quandary is no longer solely a topic in ivory towers. Down in the
barnyard, the groundlings know that they are expected to play a big
part in determining the future of the stock market. And last week,
on cue, individual investors reacted to the market's swoon with
predictable bleatings about buying opportunities and impending
rebounds. By Edward Wyatt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MONICA-TV-REVIEW _ It has been a They-Shoot-Lawyers-Don't-They?
marathon for viewers of the legal analysts who fog up the TV
screens with talk about the Monica S. Lewinsky investigation. By
Jill Abramson. WITH GRAPHIC.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LISTS-REVIEW _ Americans love lists, even bad ones, which serve
mainly to start conversations about what is and is not on them. By
Judith H. Dobrzynski. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RWANDA-REVIEW _ For anyone setting out to write a history of
recent strife in Central Africa, few opening lines could be more
tempting these days than: In the beginning there was Rwanda. By
Howard W. French. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KASHMIR-REVIEW _ In an era when some of the world's bitterest
disputes have begun to give way to accommodation, the enmity
between India and Pakistan over Kashmir erupted again over the past
10 days in ways that underscored how intractable and potentially
dangerous the confrontation has become, especially since both
countries have now demonstrated their ability to build and detonate
nuclear weapons. By John F. Burns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SANCTIONS-REVIEW (subsked) _ These days, sanctions aren't very
popular in Washington. Largely in response to complaints from farm
groups and business organizations, Congress and the White House
have concluded that most sanctions, especially unilateral ones, are
an ineffective tool in foreign policy. And in the highly
competitive global market, Washington's sanctions in particular
actually hurt U.S. companies. By Eric Schmitt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CASTRO-REVIEW _ The high point of Fidel Castro's state visit to
this 133-square-mile ``Spice Isle'' last week was the speech he
delivered at Tanteen, a cricket field flanked by a simple
grandstand and a stack of cargo containers. As a couple of thousand
people listened patiently, the Cuban leader lectured Grenadians for
an hour and a half on the history of slavery in the West Indies and
assorted other topics. By Larry Rohter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TERRORISM-REVIEW _ A terrorism scorecard. By Philip Shenon. WITH
GRAPHIC.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANGLICANS-REVIEW _ Before the world's Anglican bishops wrapped
up their once-a-decade gathering Saturday, they offered a glimpse
of what Christianity may well look like in the next century from a
global perspective. By Gustav Niebuhr. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-REFORM-REVIEW _ Now that the federal budget is actually
in balance, there is probably no subject on which Congress has
legislated with more short-term success but less long-term impact
than campaign finance. By Adam Clymer. WITH GRAPHIC.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ENGLISH-REVIEW _ Today's kids are, like, killing the English
language. Yeah, right. By Kirk Johnson.

   &UR; TRAIL FEVER: SPIN DOCTORS, RENTED STRANGERS, AND THUMB
WRESTLERS ON THE ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Lewis. Vintage, $14.
</P>
<P>
   In reporting on the 1996 presidential campaign, the author
details the nearly farcical demands of politics in the television
age and discovers more wisdom and bravery among those at the bottom
of the political food chain than at the top. The result is
``deeper, funnier and more edifying'' than the usual insider
account of life on the hustings, Phil Gailey said in the Book
Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; REALITY AND DREAMS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Muriel Spark. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.
</P>
<P>
   A hopelessly spoiled film director is tempted to play God, with
ruinous results _ not for him but for his extended ``family.'' Dame
Muriel Spark, through the voice of her all-knowing narrator, is
``as relentlessly observant of human habits and unguarded moments
as she has ever been,'' Penelope Fitzgerald wrote here last year.
An earlier novel,  &UR; THE GIRLS OF SLENDER MEANS &LR;  (New Directions,
$10.95), follows the escapades of a varied group of young women
living at a ladies' hostel in London after the Allied victory in
Europe. In 1963 our reviewer, Virgilia Peterson, praised the
author's ``absolute pitch in dialogue, her economy of style and her
sedulous avoidance of sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEWS OF A KIDNAPPING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Gabriel Garca Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   Translated by Edith Grossman. Penguin, $13.95.
</P>
<P>
   The 1982 Nobel laureate in literature chronicles the brazen
series of crimes committed by Pablo Escobar's Colombian cocaine
cartel as it sought to undermine efforts to extradite Escobar and
his fellow drug lords to the United States. Last year our reviewer,
Robert Stone, said the author had ``a quick eye for the
illuminating detail and a capacity for assembling fact.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TUMBLE HOME: A NOVELLA AND SHORT STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Amy Hempel. Scribner, $10.
</P>
<P>
   This slender collection features minimalist stories about
parenthood, death and breakups, written as if assembled from
fragments of conversation. ``Hempel writes with an effortless wit
... showing us the larger shapes of our lives by capturing their
most fleeting and fragmentary moments,'' Elizabeth Gleick wrote
here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TWENTIETH CENTURY: A PEOPLE'S HISTORY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Howard Zinn. Harper Perennial, $15.
</P>
<P>
   In this abridged version of ``A People's History of the United
States'' (1980), which has been updated into the Clinton years, a
scholar takes sides with the losers, the downtrodden and the
underdogs, arguing that too much history is written from the point
of view of governments and elites. In his review of the original,
Eric Foner found the approach to be limited, but said ``Zinn writes
with an enthusiasm rarely encountered in the leaden prose of
academic history.'' The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE AMERICAN
CENTURY: VARIETIES OF CULTURE IN MODERN TIMES &LR; , by Norman F. Cantor
($16), a sprawling guided tour of the century that was first
published in 1988 and has also been revised and updated. In
managing to cram in just about every notable trend, event and
discipline, this is an ``opinionated, idiosyncratic and thoroughly
entertaining'' survey, Hal Goodman said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CARSON VALLEY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Barich. Vintage Contemporaries, $14.
</P>
<P>
   Set against the shifting economic landscape of the wine country
of northern California, this love story centers on a troubled young
woman who returns from New York and has an affair with the manager
of her father's vineyard. In 1997 our reviewer, Linda Gray Sexton,
admired the author's ``easy grace'' and ``elegant sleight of
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LADY WHO LIKED CLEAN REST ROOMS: THE CHRONICLE OF ONE OF
THE STRANGEST STORIES EVER TO BE RUMOURED ABOUT AROUND NEW YORK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By J.P. Donleavy. St. Martin's Griffin, $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   Jocelyn Guenevere Marchantiere Jones, a fresh-mouthed
43-year-old Scarsdale matron and Daughter of the Confederacy, finds
herself slipping down the social ladder after her husband deserts
her for a bit of ``fresh flesh.'' Her travails make for a ``rich,
ribald and touching creation,'' Nina Sonenberg wrote here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOEL COWARD: A BIOGRAPHY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Philip Hoare. University of Chicago, $18.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on both careful research and gossip, the author
maintains that the public image of Noel Coward as a languid
hedonist was a fiction _ the actor, playwright, songwriter and
world-class wit was driven by an intense passion for fame. ``One of
the many merits of ... Hoare's book is to remind us of the man's
self-discipline, his rigorous professionalism and his courage,''
Miranda Seymour wrote here in 1996.  &UR; IN GHOST OF A CHANCE: A
MEMOIR &LR; , by Peter Duchin with Charles Michener (Random House,
$16.95), the last society bandleader tells the bizarre story of how
he was left by his father, the bandleader Eddy Duchin, to be raised
under the privileged wing of Averell Harriman. In 1996 our
reviewer, George W.S. Trow, called this a ``brave and stylish''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the federal budget is actually in balance, there is
probably no subject on which Congress has legislated with more
short-term success but less long-term impact than campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Thursday the House passed the Shays-Meehan bill, which
sought to outlaw the huge, unregulated soft-money contributions at
the heart of the 1996 election scandals, and to curb the
issue-advocacy advertisements by which outside groups set the
agenda for elections. The vote was an impressive 252-179.
</P>
<P>
   But in February the Senate killed a companion bill with a
filibuster. Fifty-two senators backed the bill, but that was eight
too few to cut off debate. And the House stalled long enough to let
the Senate get out of town before sending the bill across the
Capitol. So prospects are dim this year.
</P>
<P>
   If no bill becomes law, that will hardly be unusual. Campaign
finance bills have been passed eight times in the last 20 years,
but sometimes it's just the Senate that does it, sometimes it's
just the House, and sometimes they both pass a bill, but never work
out even the most trivial differences.
</P>
<P>
   Some skeptics detect a lack of congressional will here,
remembering that in 1992 House Speaker Thomas Foley only got a bill
passed by assuring wavering Democrats that President Bush would
veto it. But of course they doubted that Congress wanted to balance
the budget, too.

   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada _ The high point of Fidel Castro's state
visit to this 133-square-mile ``Spice Isle'' last week was the
speech he delivered at Tanteen, a cricket field flanked by a simple
grandstand and a stack of cargo containers. As a couple of thousand
people listened patiently and the occasional dog ambled across the
grounds, the Cuban leader lectured Grenadians for an hour and a
half on the history of slavery in the West Indies and assorted
other topics.
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to power nearly 40 years ago, Castro has used all
the world as his stage, but he seems to be playing smaller houses
these days. Leslie Pierre, editor of the leading newspaper in this
country of 100,000 people, the weekly Grenadian Voice, intended it
as a compliment when he called the Cuban president ``a Caribbean
man.'' Yet that designation also implies that Castro and his
message matter little these days outside a region that itself seems
increasingly on the fringe of world events.
</P>
<P>
   Treated in recent years as a dotty old uncle in most capitals,
even those of Latin America where his calls for revolution once
resonated, Castro found himself saluted in Grenada by Prime
Minister Keith Mitchell as an historical figure ``who can only be
compared in the 20th Century to Nelson Mandela.'' He was also
serenaded with a rousing version of the ``Internationale.''
</P>
<P>
   But the atmosphere was festive rather than threatening. Without
the Soviet Union to back it up, the communist anthem has lost its
ability to frighten the capitalist world. So, too, Castro.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, the Reagan administration's fear of Castro
and his seemingly unlimited ability to make mischief generated a
bonanza of aid and attention for the newly independent
English-speaking states in the Caribbean. Even as the other islands
were being promised preferential trade benefits as part of a
regional Caribbean Basin Initiative, some 6,000 U.S. troops invaded
Grenada in October 1983 to expel Cuban forces, and Washington
followed that up with a promise to bring Grenada into the circle of
preferred treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s, in contrast, have seen the Clinton administration
close down its regional aid office, downgrade the embassy here to a
mission and slash aid, grants and scholarships. While Cuba, itself
economically prostrate, cannot make up for that gap, Mitchell and
his regional colleagues have seized on Cuba's own need for friends
in hopes of creating a countervailing weight to Washington's
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such a strategy will work is another matter. ``In a
post-Cold War world, this region unfortunately is no longer
relevant'' to the great powers, one diplomat in the region said.
Caribbean leaders may see Castro as a useful card to play to get
Washington's attention, ``but I'm not sure even that is true,'' the
diplomat added. ``Cuba wants to be headmaster of the Caribbean
family, but since it is a Soviet proxy no longer, the United States
really doesn't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the heyday of Cuba's alliance with Grenada, Castro aimed
high, agreeing to build an airport that could be used to bring in
tourists _ and to refuel Cuban planes ferrying troops to and from
Africa. This time around, what he was offering seemed modest, even
innocuous, reflecting straitened circumstances in both countries: a
new wing on a hospital here and 22 additional scholarships for
Grenadians to study at Cuban universities.
</P>
<P>
   For Cuba, the principal benefit of such aid efforts today is not
that they advance a geopolitical strategy. Rather, it is that they
provide employment for Cuban doctors, engineers and teachers who
would otherwise be idle at home or seeking jobs as hotel doormen or
taxi drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most telling moment of Castro's visit, however, came
when Grenada Education Minister Lawrence Joseph acknowledged during
a meeting that one thing is always certain when local students get
scholarships to Cuba. Unlike those who enroll in Britain, Canada or
the United States, they always return home just as soon as their
studies are done.

 HOW TO BYPASS SANCTIONS AND DO BUSINESS  
 (The Week in Review)  
 (duplication warning: also sent with `i' code)  
 (bl)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once again, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is
thumbing his nose at the world community. Last week, he said he is
through cooperating with international weapons inspectors and wants
the crippling economic sanctions on his country lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council berated Iraq for its intransigence, and
demanded that Baghdad change its decision. The Clinton
administration has vowed to block any easing of the sanctions the
United Nations imposed in 1991 after the Persian Gulf war until
Baghdad accounts for all of its nuclear, chemical, biological and
missile programs.
</P>
<P>
   But these days sanctions aren't very popular in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Largely in response to complaints from farm groups and business
organizations, Congress and the White House have concluded that
most sanctions, especially unilateral ones, are an ineffective tool
in foreign policy. And in the highly competitive global market,
Washington's sanctions in particular actually hurt U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to support the Hitlers of the world, but if
you're the only country imposing sanctions, they have no effect,''
said Tom Mick, chief executive of the Washington Wheat Commission,
a trade group in Spokane that has urged the administration to end
sanctions against Iran, a former top customer of Pacific Northwest
wheat.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of sanctions are less likely to acknowledge that
most existing penalties are riddled with exemptions, waivers and
legal loopholes. Exemptions are designed to permit humanitarian aid
and give presidents some diplomatic wiggle room. Farmers have been
adept at using them to keep a commercial toehold, and sometimes
much more, in even the most reviled rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   Congress often puts profits ahead of principle when the business
interests are big enough. Just a few weeks after it angrily
condemned India and Pakistan for conducting nuclear tests in May,
Congress enacted sanctions but exempted food exports, removing the
biggest sting the penalties could inflict. Why? Wheat farmers in
the Pacific Northwest howled because Pakistan was their biggest
customer, and the sanctions would have barred them from bidding on
a $37 million wheat order from that country.
</P>
<P>
   The same legislation that waived food exports also included a
little-noticed provision that exempted fertilizer from the
sanctions. That's because India is the second-largest importer of
American phosphate fertilizer, mostly from Florida, which exports
$1.7 billion in fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fertilizer is just as important as food and medicine,'' said
Kathleen Mathers of The Fertilizer Institute, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Iran may still be virtually closed to U.S. companies, but
Midwestern wheat farmers from Kansas to Texas are benefiting from a
year-old United Nations program that allows Iraq to sell a limited
amount of oil to buy food and medicine for humanitarian purposes.
In the program's first year, Iraq bought 817,000 metric tons _
about $114 million worth _ of hard red winter wheat, which placed
that country eighth among foreign buyers of American wheat. At a
time when wheat prices are at 10-year low, and orders from Asia
have plummeted because of the economic crisis there, the new
business from Baghdad is welcome news in Topeka and Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, American businesses prefer to avoid sanctions
altogether. Last year, as the administration was weighing whether
to impose a ban on new American investment in Myanmar because of
its human rights abuses, the Unocal Corporation signed a deal with
that government to expand a $1.2 billion joint venture with the
French oil company, Total, to develop gas fields off the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Unocal denied that there was any rush to sign the deal ahead of
impending sanctions. ``It was coincidental,'' said Barry Lane, a
company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In other pariah states like Cuba and North Korea, American
farmers and businesses are donating food or agricultural products
outright with the administration's blessing, hoping to position
themselves to compete with international rivals when embargoes are
finally lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Grains Council, the export development arm of the
American corn, barley and sorghum industries, donated 4,000 pounds
of mixed feed grain last spring to a Cuban aid organization.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas wheat farmers and the wheat industry's export development
arm donated 22,000 pounds of flour to Cuba in February with an eye
on the day a new regime rules in Havana. ``Cuba could be a pretty
significant market,'' said Lisa Jager, a spokesman for U.S. Wheat
Associates, the export arm.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, Washington state and Mercy Corps International, a
relief organization in Portland, Ore., donated 500 apple trees to
North Korea. ``We've been trying to figure out ways to open the
door there,'' said Ralph Munro, Washington's secretary of state,
who helped organize the donation.
</P>
<P>
   But commercial dealings with cash-poor rogue nations are still
risky. Last year, North Korea abruptly abandoned a plan to barter
zinc for 20,000 tons of American wheat.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's snub came as the ship-bound wheat was only days
from delivery, and left the American company, Cargill, Inc., a
Minneapolis-based commodities dealer, in the lurch. ``We sold the
grain on the market at a significant loss,'' said Bonnie Raquet, a
Cargill spokeswoman.

   Legislators Vote to Accuse Reno of Contempt
</P>
<P>
   No top government official has ever been prosecuted for contempt
of Congress. But that did not stop the House Committee on
Government Reform and Oversight from voting along party lines last
week to charge Attorney General Janet Reno with the crime. The
committee's complaint is that Reno refuses to turn over memorandums
from the Justice Department's top investigators, including FBI
Director Louis Freeh, holding that the law requires her to ask for
an independent counsel to investigate Democratic campaign finance
abuses in the last election.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Reno has adamantly refused to seek an outside
prosecutor. But even before the committee voted, there were
indications that she was reconsidering the question.

</P>
<P>
   The United States has kept its title as the world's biggest arms
merchant, but Russia and France are poised to overtake it, the
Congressional Research Service reported.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has led the world arms trade for seven
straight years. It sold $15.2 billion worth of weapons to other
nations last year, a 44 percent share of the shrinking global arms
market. That shrinkage has a number of causes: the end of the Cold
War, the end of a splurge of weapons purchases after the 1991
Persian Gulf war, the economic crisis in Asia and the long slump in
crude oil prices, which has helped slow arms purchases by Saudi
Arabia and other Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the world remains awash in arms. Developing nations
alone have bought $172 billion worth in the 1990s.

   Trauma at 2 Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   Past was all-too-palpable prologue in last week's turmoil at The
Boston Globe and The Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   At The Globe, where wounds caused by the revelation of
fabrication by a prized columnist were still healing, a second
prominent columnist found himself in the crosshairs. Mike Barnicle
came under fire after The Boston Herald documented that 10 items in
his column titled ``I was just thinking,'' paralleled jokes in
comedian George Carlin's book, ``Brain Droppings.''
</P>
<P>
   That led his editors to suspend him. But when Barnicle, who said
he had not read the book, turned up on a video clip recommending it
as summer reading, Globe editor Matthew Storin asked him to resign.
He declined. Friday, to resolve the impasse, Barnicle met with the
Globe's publisher, Benjamin Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Miami Herald publisher David Lawrence told
an emotional crowd in the newspaper's cafeteria that he was
resigning. The announcement came after the staff had received memos
alluding to possible cutbacks. The Herald had a round of cuts three
years ago; some employees feared that the new publisher, Alberto
Ibarguen, whose experience was gained on the business side of
newspapers, would preside over more cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ibarguen spoke of ``streamlining,'' not
layoffs. The question, he said, was, ``How can we grow with this
community _ how do we take a mature and traditional institution and
fit an untraditional and evolving area?''

   Watching Kosovo Simmer
</P>
<P>
   Washington and NATO, embarrassed by a brutal Serb campaign
against ethnic Albanians in the southern Serbian province of
Kosovo, warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic yet again that
he risks military retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   The warning came in a message to Milosevic from Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, who is seeking rapid negotiation between
the Serbs and Kosovar representatives.
</P>
<P>
   To make this latest threat more credible, NATO drafted
operational plans for limited air strikes against Serb forces that
could be more easily authorized by the alliance. And it announced
military exercises next week in Albania and next month in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials recognize Milosevic's right to put down a
rebellion, but say they are horrified by his tactics, which include
the razing of villages and the displacement of at least 10 percent
of the population.

   A Slap for Arafat
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat turned 70 last week, but along with a celebration
the Palestinian leader received a rebuke to his governance.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat had been under pressure since last year from Palestinian
lawmakers to root out corruption and mismanagement from within his
Palestinian Authority. But the response that he finally unveiled
was so widely seen as inadequate that two ministers _ including
Hannan Ashrawi, an internationally prominent figure _ quit in
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's standing had already been diminished among Palestinians
by the lack of progress toward a broader peace with Israel. He has
always been able to rally support by blaming Israel for the
faltering peace, and he still commands great respect. But
increasingly now, Palestinians have felt freer to conclude that in
his aversion to addressing problems of efficient administration at
home, he is leaving himself no one to blame but Yasser Arafat.

   A Case of Switched Identity
</P>
<P>
   Paula Johnson of Ruckersville, Va., had been raising little
Callie Marie for three years when, in order to induce the presumed
father to pay child support, she had a paternity test done. The
test showed that Callie wasn't his child _ and another test showed
Ms. Johnson wasn't the mother.
</P>
<P>
   The little girl had been switched at birth, with another at the
University of Medical Center in Charlottesville. Callie was the
daughter of a couple in Buena Vista, Va., Kevin Chittum and Tamara
Whitney Rogers, and Rebecca, the child they were raising, had been
born to Ms. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Monday it was discovered that Carrie's biological
parents had died in a Fourth of July car wreck. Ms. Johnson and the
Chittum and Rogers clans are now grappling with how the girls
should be raised. They are talking to lawyers, but none is named
Solomon.

   A Swimmer Founders
</P>
<P>
   At the Summer Olympics in Atlanta two years ago, Michelle Smith
de Bruin of Ireland won three gold medals, a feat that surprised
many because her performance times had improved dramatically late
in her career.
</P>
<P>
   Now the International Swimming Federation has banned her from
competition for four years after finding that she tampered with a
drug test by spiking her urine sample with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The swimmer, now 28, denied wrongdoing, said she would appeal
the ban, and would sue the federation in a fight to clear her name.
She passed her drug tests in Atlanta; the test she was said to have
manipulated was conducted while out of competition this year.
</P>
<P>
   Doubt on Crime Statistics
</P>
<P>
   Crime has been dropping dramatically for the past six years, to
the lowest level since the 1960s, when the late-20th-century crime
wave exploded in the United States. But now charges are being
raised that police commanders in several cities have falsified
their crime statistics to keep up with the nationwide decline, and
this is raising concern that some crime data may be skewed.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, senior police officials have been
demoted or forced to resign because some crime statistics were
manipulated in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Boca Raton, Fla.
Typically, felonies like burglary were downgraded to less serious
crimes like trespassing or vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these incidents, criminologists say the general downward
trend in crime is undoubtedly true, since it has shown up not only
in police reports but also in a Justice Department survey of
victims of crimes nationwide.

   Indian Rights, Canadian Style &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 years after they made their first land claim, the
Nisga'a people of British Columbia signed a treaty that gives them
title to an area more than half the size of Rhode Island, along
with control over almost everything that happens there.
</P>
<P>
   But a treaty is only a first step to self-sufficiency, as
American Indian tribes who gathered in Washington last week for a
conference on development know.
</P>
<P>
   If the Nisga'a treaty is ratified by the provincial and federal
parliaments, traditional federal support will be cut. The 5,500
Nisga'a will then have to collect their own taxes and figure out
how to provide services and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   This is a problem that some American tribes have solved by
turning to gambling casinos. But Canada's Nisga'a say they have
other plans: to rely on traditional economic enterprises like
timber and fishing.

   Shhh. It Was a Secret. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The British government does not like it when its spies talk
about their jobs. In fact, under the Official Secrets Act, workers
at the security services are forbidden to disclose anything to
anyone about any aspect of their work.
</P>
<P>
   That was why it took 25 years for Sir John Masterman to get
permission in 1972 to publish ``The Double-Cross System,'' about
how Britain subverted Germany's World War II spies _ and then only
after Yale University Press in America forced the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Something even more peculiar happened in the ``Spycatcher'' case
in the 1980s, when a book disclosing British spy secrets was
published in the United States. That time, British newspapers were
forbidden to reveal what the book said, but Britons smuggled it in
and sold it by the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, history seemed to repeat itself when David Shayler, a
former officer at the Libya desk of Britain's domestic security
service, was arrested after threatening to disclose embarrassing
agency secrets on the Internet. Newspapers that were poised to
publish his allegations found themselves slapped with far-reaching
injunctions in the name of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Thursday, the newspaper The Guardian reprinted an
article by The New York Times that described the British news
media's inability to cover Shayler's story. It included details of
Shayler's allegation that Britain's foreign intelligence service
botched an assassination attempt against Moammar Gadhafi in 1996 _
details subject to the injunction.
</P>
<P>
   The British government didn't prosecute The Guardian. But it
reissued its warnings to reporters not to repeat anything else
Shayler had told them.

 TOP 100 PAINTINGS? IMPOSSIBLE. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans love lists, even bad ones, which serve mainly to start
conversations about what is and is not on them.
</P>
<P>
   Establishmentarians hate lists, unless they are the ones making
them, especially as a marketing gimmick. The recent roster of the
100 best novels of this century, promulgated by the Modern Library
division of Random House, met endless snickers among the culturally
refined. The New Yorker mocked the very idea with a cartoon
suggesting an even more outlandish undertaking _ it showed the New
York Metropolitan Museum of Art dressed in a banner proclaiming
``One Week Only! The 100 Greatest Paintings of All Time.''
</P>
<P>
   But if learned panels can choose the 100 greatest novels, movies
or even historically influential people, why not the 100 greatest
works of art? Art world cognoscenti say it cannot and should not be
done. There is too much art to consider. Visual art, unlike novels,
movies and television, has been around since the beginning of
recorded history.
</P>
<P>
   And artists seem to churn out much more than their peers in
other disciplines. Van Gogh, for example, painted for only 10 years
before committing suicide at the age of 37 but still left behind
2,000 paintings and drawings. Vermeer, with just three dozen works
to his credit, is considered a slacker. So maybe, some experts
said, you could produce a list of the 1,000 greatest works of art,
but no fewer than that.
</P>
<P>
   Each piece of art is unique and should be experienced in person
_ which complicates matters. Many experts believe that the
16th-century Isenheim altarpiece painted by Matthias Grunewald is a
masterpiece that should be on anyone's top 100 _ anyone who has
made the trip to Colmar, France, where it resides.
</P>
<P>
   Even when art experts concede the inherent entertainment value
of a list, they just don't think that the 100 greatest works of art
promotes art the way parallel lists prompt people to reach for
books and watch movies. That's because viewing art takes more
initiative; you have to go to it. Arnold Lehman, director of the
Brooklyn Museum of Art, has another objection. ``By putting an
object on a list, you're turning it into a precious commodity in a
way that doesn't benefit art. People see the value, the dollar
signs and who owns the object before they see the object. That
cheapens this incredible, tangible expression of genius.''
</P>
<P>
   But it may be too late. Two people who strive to popularize art
are already doing the inconceivable. Thomas Hoving, the former
director of the Metropolitan Museum, and Sister Wendy Beckett, the
British nun whose television programs and books have made her a
one-woman art industry, have separately compiled lists. Neither
author follows the top-100 rubric to the letter, nor arranges the
choices in any order, but it hardly matters. Hoving's book, titled
``Greatest Works of Art of Western Civilization'' (Artisan, 1997),
promises to give readers ``the pinnacles of quality, elegance and
artistic strength, the best mankind has created, the hallmarks of
unalloyed genius.''
</P>
<P>
   The icons are there _ van Gogh's ``Starry Night,'' Vermeer's
``View of Delft,'' Manet's ``Bar at the Folies Bergere,'' Titian's
``Rape of Europa,'' Munch's ``Scream.'' But so are some surprises _
George Bellows' ``North River,'' Montezuma's headdress, Leonardo da
Vinci's ``Woman with an Ermine'' (but not the ``Mona Lisa.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Sister Wendy's Favorite Things,'' a list of 75 items, is due
out mid-1999. Her publishing company, Harry N. Abrams, declined to
disclose exactly what will be included but offered a taste of her
taste: classics like the bust of Nefertiti from 1360 B.C. and
Pierre Bonnard's ``The Open Window.'' Sister Wendy also wants to
surprise, so she will include the Metropolitan's 16th-century
carving of St. Anthony Abbot, a 19th-century Shaker table from the
Philadelphia Museum of Art and George Stubbs' ``Mare and Foals in a
Wooded Landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Even from this scant evidence, a consensus emerges. Hoving chose
Nefertiti, too, and Sister Wendy picked the same Manet and Vermeer
paintings as he did. Hoving chose Michelangelo's ``David,'' while
Sister Wendy selected his ``Creation of Man'' in the Sistine
Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Marzio, the director of the Museum of Fine Arts in
Houston, is one member of the establishment who is not horrified by
the whole subject. He even suggested two lists, one drawn up by
experts and one voted on by the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know what the general public thinks are the
greatest works of art,'' Marzio said. ``It would probably be Monet,
Monet and Monet at the top. The one work that might make it on both
lists is the `Mona Lisa,' and maybe the bust of Nefertiti.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. Maybe the whole idea isn't such a stumper, after all.

   Hours after the deadly car bombings at the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania on Friday, President Clinton vowed to hunt down
those responsible ``no matter what or how long it takes.'' But
history suggests it can take a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   When terrorists take aim at Americans abroad, the perpetrators
are rarely identified with any certainty and seldom caught or
punished _ almost always because of the complications of joint
investigations with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   This time U.S. officials hope for better cooperation in what the
State Department described as the first nearly simultaneous
terrorist attacks in separate countries. The bombs, apparently in
vehicles parked outside the embassies, killed more than 60 in
Nairobi, including eight Americans. Another 1,100 people were
wounded. At least nine people were killed in Dar es Salaam, none
American, and scores were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia in June 1996 is a grim
example of the difficulties of solving a case: A truck bomb
detonated at an apartment building, killing 19 U.S. airmen. The
second anniversary of that attack passed two months ago with U.S.
authorities expressing exasperation over their inability to
identify those involved, and admitting privately that the
investigation had collapsed because of disputes with Saudi
investigators.

 A SURPRISING CONSERVATIVE SURGE AMONG ANGLICANS

<P>
   CANTERBURY, England _ Before the world's Anglican bishops
wrapped up their once-a-decade gathering Saturday, they offered a
glimpse of what Christianity may well look like in the next century
from a global perspective.
</P>
<P>
   It was a vision that was multicultural and, at times, decidedly
conservative _ enough to make some of the prelates of the Episcopal
Church in the United States and the Church of England appear as
marginal players in a landscape their institutions once dominated.
</P>
<P>
   The Lambeth Conference, which was last held in 1988, was rich in
racial and ethnic diversity, with participants from churches in 160
different nations, and began July 18 with a worship service in
Canterbury Cathedral, the seat of the archbishop who is considered
the ``unifying figure'' of the 73 million-member Anglican
Communion.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops discussed such issues as international poverty and
pollution, but they seemed to speak loudest on questions of sexual
ethics and the authority of Scripture. Their tone, said Dr. R.
William Franklin, dean of Berkeley Divinity School at Yale
University, made this ``the most conservative conference of the
20th century,'' among the Lambeth gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone needed evidence of that conservatism, it came
Wednesday when the approximately 750 bishops settled in to tackle
an advisory resolution on human sexuality. Its original text,
written in committee, affirmed a traditional position on marriage
as the lifelong union of a man and a woman. It also condemned
homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   But when the document was brought before the whole conference,
socially conservative bishops toughened its language with
amendments, one calling for abstinence from any sex outside
marriage, another pointedly rejecting homosexual activity as
``incompatible with Scripture.'' Those who took the lead in this
process were mainly from the churches of Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows us to uphold biblical teaching, especially biblical
morality,'' said Archbishop Donald Mtetemela of Tanzania, speaking
for the amendment against homosexual activity. A Nigerian bishop
was more blunt: ``To accept homosexuality in our church is for
Anglicans to commit evangelical suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Their emphatic approach seemed to take liberal bishops by
surprise, leaving them out-organized and out-talked. In the
Episcopal Church, by contrast, conservatives had failed to block
some bishops from ordaining gay men and lesbians as priests.
</P>
<P>
   After two hours of debate, the amended resolution was passed.
</P>
<P>
   The story here had partly to do with numbers. At the 1988
gathering, Anglican leaders proclaimed the next 10 years as a
``decade of evangelism.'' The results were spread unevenly, to say
the least. The churches in Africa and Asia grew, while those in
England and North America did not. In fact, American membership
fell. This time, 228 African bishops who were heads of dioceses
came to the conference, up from 130 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Such growth in Africa and South Asia is a major trend within
Christianity. ``This is still news for most of the Christian
population in the United States of America,'' said Dean Gilliland,
a professor of contextual theology and African studies at Fuller
Theological Seminary in Pasadena, Calif. ``They don't know the
center of gravity has moved from the West.''
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, where the faith has been growing fastest, there are
an estimated 27 million Anglicans, more than 10 times the number of
Episcopalians in the United States. To take another example,
African Lutherans increased from 5.7 million to 9 million since
1991, surpassing the total membership of Lutheran denominations in
North America.
</P>
<P>
   But numbers do not tell the whole story. Many of the African and
Asian churches exist in societies where Christianity is a minority
faith, often confronted by antagonistic religious competitors, such
as militant Islamic groups, or overtly hostile secular governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unlike the experience that formed John Paul II,''
Franklin said, referring to the pope's formative years as priest
and later a bishop under a communist regime in Poland that regarded
the Catholic Church as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders forged in such environments, Franklin said, often
espouse a ``Christianity of clarity'' that has little room for
ambiguity and is suspicious of accommodating the surrounding
culture. They may take ``a harder line, a more authoritative line
in Scripture and morals,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Among the bishops supporting the amended resolution, which is
nonbinding, were those who said they were concerned about how any
perceived wavering on homosexuality would be regarded in their own
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Alexander Malik of Lahore, Pakistan, said after the
meeting that a statement rejecting homosexuality would help him
respond to verbal challenges to his faith from some Muslims. ``They
say, `What kind of ethics and morality are you preaching?''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative bishops from the United States, England and
Australia were pleased about the stand on homosexuality. But those
who disagreed were left to ponder their place in an Anglican
Communion whose ground seemed to have shifted beneath them.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Frederick Borsch of Los Angeles issued a statement saying
he was disappointed with the resolution, noting that gay men and
lesbians ``are still very much a part of us.'' But he also said, in
a response that sorted out priorities, that he looked forward to
the conference ``going on to deal with critical matters'' like
outreach to young people and help for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Another prelate, Archbishop Njongonkulu Ndungane of Cape Town,
South Africa, said that at the heart of the communion's differences
are people who interpret the Bible differently, with some looking
to it for an explicit moral code and others for a broad revelation
of God's purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Ndungane said he subscribed to a historic view of Anglicanism,
in which respect for Scripture, tradition and reason allowed the
member churches a certain latitude in their practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not want to characterize things as a split between
north and south,'' he said. ``What has been characteristic here has
been our differences and otherness. The struggle and pain has been
to live creatively within the differences.''

 ECONOMIC AND MARKET TRENDS: FORGET WHICH CAME FIRST. WHAT COMES
NEXT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
made a few cautionary comments about the economy and uttered an
ominous warning about ``irrational exuberance'' among stock market
investors. Investors were jolted upright for a few days, then
shrugged, and stock prices soared even higher in the months
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Greenspan gave a surprisingly upbeat report on the
economy and suggested that stock prices did not appear out of line
with the current good times. Almost immediately, investors grew
wary, and stock prices beat a retreat that quickened considerably
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Which, among rational souls, raises perplexing questions. Does
the stock market's performance have anything to do with the outlook
for the economy? Can the economy be helped or hindered by the
performance of the stock market? And, above all, which comes first:
a strong economy or a bull market? Recession or crash?
</P>
<P>
   The mystifying nature of that chicken-or-egg quandary is no
longer solely a topic in ivory towers. Down in the barnyard, the
groundlings know that they are expected to play a big part in
determining the future of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, on cue, individual investors reacted to the
market's swoon with predictable bleatings about buying
opportunities and impending rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual investors believe they have learned that the
market, like Joe Palooka, always bounces back,'' said Ira Kaminow,
an economist and president of Capital Insights Group, a Washington,
D.C., consulting firm. One day the market will not bounce back,
however, and a sustained decline will lead to a drop in consumer
spending, now a key source of fuel for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would take a fairly substantial and persistent
decline, one lasting six to nine months, for their enthusiasm and
optimism to begin to wane,'' Kaminow said.
</P>
<P>
   When the downturn comes, the effect might be more pronounced
than it was during the boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the way up, the stock market's gains did not boost spending
as much as people had expected,'' said Anthony Chan, chief
economist at Banc One Investment Advisors, based in Columbus, Ohio.
``For every $1 of capital gains, we've seen consumer spending rise
by about 3 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the black ink on investors' mutual fund account
statements starts turning to red, he said, ``for every $1 in losses
we'll see a decline in consumption of 4 to 4.5 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the performance of the stock market influences whether
individuals spend money, and thus affects the nation's economy. The
savings rate has fallen to historic lows in recent months not
because people believe that they do not need to put away a few
dollars for retirement. Rather, they have grown to believe they can
put away some loose change, then wait for the ever-rising stock
market to turn that into dollars.
</P>
<P>
   With the rest of their money _ some of which they would
otherwise be saving _ individuals feel free to buy new cars, take
more exotic vacations, finish paneling the basement or likewise
spend on frills that they would have ignored.
</P>
<P>
   That spending creates demand for goods, causing factories to
hire workers to assemble automobiles, staff hotels and churn out
linoleum. Sales of their products and services create greater
profits for those companies; higher earnings help to boost the
companies' stock prices, resulting in greater returns for and Ms.
Spendthrift's mutual funds. The virtuous circle starts anew.
</P>
<P>
   The rising tide, moreover, lifts even the heaviest boats. The
gains that average Americans reap from their investments result in
more tax dollars for federal and state coffers. Budget surpluses,
in turn, lead to calls for lower taxes and even greater optimism
among individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock market can also work against the economy, quickly
turning the virtuous circle into a vicious cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The trigger can be anything _ Asian tremors, the unraveling of a
merger, a border skirmish. Often, traders sell first, leaving the
questions for later.
</P>
<P>
   When capital gains turn into capital losses, government revenues
dry up, as does spending by consumers, as does hiring by companies.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan recently pointed out that Japan had a similar
experience. Revenues were pouring into the government during the
bubble economy, then when things turned bad, the deluge turned into
a drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that respect,'' Kaminow said, ``the Japanese might be seven
to nine years ahead of where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States over just the last three and a half years,
sharp gains in the stock market have produced substantial profits
for most people in their mutual funds. Those profits have been
maintained even as many individual stocks have suffered big
declines.
</P>
<P>
   In each year since the beginning of 1995, investors have poured
a record amount of money into mutual funds that invest in American
stocks, and the total in the first six months of 1998 is ahead of
last year's pace.
</P>
<P>
   Weighting those $600 billion of investments by the stock-market
levels at which they were made shows that Americans have aggregate
profits of 45 percent over that three-and-a-half year span.
Clearly, it would take a much sharper decline than last week's to
get their attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the current stock market decline is enough to
drag consumption growth down to recessionary levels,'' said Chan
said on Thursday. ``Before we get there, we'll need to see
employment growth slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy
added jobs in July at the slowest pace in more than two years.
Weakness in the manufacturing sector could easily be traced to the
General Motors strike, but service companies, like those in the
financial industry, also slowed. The stock market responded by
moving higher.
</P>
<P>
   A market downturn could give a sharp and sudden jolt to
employment, however.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in the securities market has spawned rapid growth not
only in the financial services industry but also in the innumerable
pilot fish that swim alongside _ more mutual fund salesclerks, more
real estate agents selling apartments to bonus-toting brokers, more
deliverymen bringing sandwiches to late-night dealmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the equity market doesn't continue to do very well, the
first areas you'll see it is in the Northeast,'' particularly New
York City, Chan said. ``The market has driven real estate prices in
New York. The luxury sectors will start to slow. And at some point
it will spill over into Main Street.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what is the likelihood that the current weakness will morph
into a brutish downturn anytime soon? ``It's a non-trivial
probability,'' said Kaminow. ``But less than 50-50. I'm more
optimistic than pessimistic, but compared to a year ago, I can see
the dangers more easily.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Greenspan, he is undoubtedly happy that investors are
heeding his words, said Chan. ``The entire Federal Reserve is
probably dancing in the street after seeing that some of the air
was let out of the market.''

 WHEN TOO MUCH ISN'T ENOUGH ALL MONICA, ALL THE TIME: A VIEWERS'
GUIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Assuming his usual role defending and defending and
defending President Clinton on television, Lanny Davis looked a bit
weary last Wednesday night on MSNBC's ``The News With Brian
Williams.'' He was spun out.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, he had been interviewed by MSNBC's Keith
Olbermann and by CNBC's Geraldo Rivera. Wednesday morning, he had
answered the call of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on Williams' show, he was sparring with the conservative
pundit Laura Ingraham, who was once more grinding her heel into
Bill Clinton, lambasting ``the O.J. presidency.'' Davis, a former
special counsel for the Clinton White House, could only muster a
muted response, protesting the attack as ``entirely unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a They-Shoot-Lawyers-Don't-They? marathon for viewers
of the legal analysts who fog up the TV screens with talk about the
Monica Lewinsky investigation. With the drama peaking as Ms.
Lewinsky met the grand jury, the babble about transactional
immunity, obstruction and executive privilege grew even more
feverish. The usual suspects were lined up like shuttles at the
Washington airport on a Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Davis interrupted a business trip to make a round of appearances
because, he said, he felt an obligation to ``defend President
Clinton and bring some balance to some of the coverage.'' Davis
returned to Patton Boggs &AMP; Blow, one of the biggest law and
lobbying firms in Washington, earlier this year. But he said he
checks in with the White House for the latest public information
before he goes on television.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing their nightly star turns might end after the Monica case
fades, the pundits are making the most of every moment _ even if it
means interrupting vacations. Stuart Taylor, legal affairs writer
for The National Journal, agreed to let a crew from MSNBC interview
him on Cape Cod. Bugs were swarming around Taylor, who was
outdoors. ``I was trying not to swat at them while I was on
camera,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The gaggle of legal analysts appearing on
all-Monica-all-the-time cable news shows has grown because, despite
polls showing a lack of public concern about the investigation,
ratings still soar for moments like Linda Tripp's courthouse plea
for sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon exploded with the O.J. Simpson case, which made
CNN's Greta Van Susteren, Johnnie Cochran and most of the lawyers
on both sides TV stars, and has escalated with the president's
legal travails. Like Ms. Van Susteren, many of the Simpson pundits
have permutated into Clinton pundits, notwithstanding any lack of
political expertise.
</P>
<P>
   In the Simpson case, the commentators were usually former
prosecutors or criminal defense attorneys with no particular stake
in the outcome. In the Lewinsky case, the affiliations of some
commentators are more complex and, in some cases, obscured. Like
reporters, legal analysts have embraced the culture of conflict,
choosing sides so they can bark at each other.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' former job as the White House's spinner-in-chief makes
his sympathies obvious to most viewers, and Jack Quinn, the former
White House counsel who might return in a Gore administration, is
an obvious Clinton partisan. Quinn has downgraded the president's
alleged sin so many times that he now argues that, even if there
was a relationship with the intern, it was consensual and
therefore, ``trivial.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor caused a stir when it came out that he had considered
joining Starr's staff, a fact rarely mentioned now. The ideological
or partisan backgrounds of other analysts aren't always disclosed,
either.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bradford Berenson, a Washington lawyer who has
appeared often as a legal commentator on the Lewinsky case, is
usually identified as a criminal law expert. Berenson, a 1991
Harvard Law School graduate, practices criminal defense law in the
Washington office of Sidley &AMP; Austin, a Chicago-based firm. He is
also active in the Federalist Society, a group of conservative
lawyers that includes Starr. He said in an interview that he has
met Starr three times and is close to several younger lawyers who
worked on Starr's Whitewater investigation. It was those friends
who first encouraged him to talk to reporters and producers about
the Starr investigation, Berenson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that I'm sympathetic to Starr and feel he's been
unfairly treated by the White House,'' he said. ``But I try to be
clear and objective and I don't spin for anyone.'' He said some
interviewers do mention his conservative leanings when they
introduce him.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Olson also frequently provides analysis on the Starr
investigation and is often identified as a former prosecutor. Mrs.
Olson worked in the U.S. attorney's office in Washington for three
years and is in demand because she is telegenic and offers clear
explanations of legalities.
</P>
<P>
   But her resume also includes prominent partisan positions, like
counsel to Republicans on House and Senate committees that
investigated alleged Clinton administration ethical improprieties
and Democratic fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Olson began receiving television invitations _ from
Rivera and CNN _ the appearances were mainly at night. Then she
began receiving daytime invitations, too. So she asked for and was
given a leave of absence by her boss, Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.
Then, in June, her appearances became so frequent that Mrs. Olson
resigned. In an interview, she said, ``I didn't want there to be
any questions about whether I was voicing his opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Olson and her husband, the lawyer Theodore Olson, are also
close friends of Starr. While this fact isn't part of Mrs. Olson's
usual introduction, she said she sometimes referred to her
friendship with the independent counsel in her comments about him.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons she wanted to talk about the Starr
investigation on television was that other legal commentators were
calling Starr's tactics ``unheard of,'' she said. ``It sounded out
of line and like politics. It seemed so lopsided and that I could
add some balance.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Mrs. Olson's Democratic counterparts, Richard
Ben-Veniste, who served as counsel to the minority during the
Senate's Whitewater probe, also appears on television frequently to
discuss the Lewinsky case. Like Mrs. Olson, Ben-Veniste, a veteran
of the Justice Department's Watergate Task Force, is usually
identified as a former prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Giuffra, a New York lawyer, is frequently identified as a
``former Whitewater special counsel'' or a ``former Senate
Whitewater counsel,'' but his background is more complex. He was
hired three years ago by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., as chief
counsel to the Republican majority on the Senate Banking Committee,
which conducted a Whitewater investigation under D'Amato's
direction. Before that, Giuffra had represented D'Amato's brother,
Armand, successfully appealing his mail-fraud conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In a sound-bite culture, when there are only a few minutes for
each lawyer to offer his comments, it's impossible to provide
detailed resumes for all guests. One network producer said his
Sunday public affairs show was careful to quiz guests about their
ideological or partisan affiliations so that panels could be
assembled with a variety of points of view, even if individual
affiliations weren't fully disclosed on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Several law professors are also in demand. Georgetown's Paul
Rothstein, who also offered commentary during the Simpson case,
said, ``The public and network appetite for commentary is
surprisingly large.'' Rothstein, who appears on network and local
television several times a week, said he found it difficult to
discuss ``grungy sexual matters and the president in the same
breath.''
</P>
<P>
   And on a clear day, you can see Jonathan Turley forever. The
George Washington University professor specializes in environmental
law, and he certainly knows how to permeate the atmosphere. He
instantly blossomed into the most promiscuous quote on Ms. Lewinsky
and the president, saturating newspapers as well as NBC's ``Today''
show, ABC's ``Nightline,'' NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' CNN's
``Crossfire'' and other cable shows.
</P>
<P>
   Why do they do it? Lanny Davis, being lawyerly, answered the
question with a question. ``How do you spell meshugana?''

   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ For anyone setting out to write a history
of recent strife in Central Africa, few opening lines could be more
tempting these days than: In the beginning there was Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The former Zaire, now again known as Congo, has certainly
figured more in the news in the last two years as the continent's
most graphic study in strife. It has seen the fall of its longtime
dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, and the rise of his conqueror, Laurent
Kabila, at the head of a stunningly successful African foreign
legion.
</P>
<P>
   As if jealous of its notoriety, Congo even staged a news
comeback last week with a reprise of the very kind of rebellion
Kabila led two years ago, with the difference that this time Kabila
was the intended target.
</P>
<P>
   But if Congo, this continent's third largest country, has been
the scene of most of Central Africa's recent dramas, a primary
actor has been operating barely off stage in each of them:
minority-ruled Rwanda, one of the continent's smallest nations.
Repeatedly, it has intervened to pursue its self-defined interests
in a sphere that seems to include a quarter of the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the Congo crisis on the BBC, Philip Reyntjens, a
Belgian expert in Central African affairs, recently explained that
the country's renewed troubles result from two unresolved problems:
the legal status of eastern Congo's so-called Banyamulenge
population, and Rwanda's own festering conflict between its large
and disenfranchised Hutu majority and the Tutsi regime that seized
power in the midst of a campaign of genocide aimed against its
people in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Banyamulenge are relatively recent arrivals in Congo, most
of them having migrated from Rwanda one to three generations ago;
considering that fact, it is no longer hard to imagine that Congo's
recent crises are, to a large degree, expressions of tiny Rwanda's
own intractable problems.
</P>
<P>
   With its lush, hilly countryside, where the next village seems
to begin as soon as the last has ended, no country in Africa is as
densely populated as Rwanda. And when the long-poisoned relations
between the Hutu (85 percent of the population) and Tutsi (15
percent) boil over in violence, as they have repeatedly and on a
terrible scale, Rwanda's less crowded neighbors typically pay the
price.
</P>
<P>
   The unwritten rule of these dramas, with their death tolls
routinely running into the hundreds of thousands, is that the
region's sickest countries _ the poorest and least well governed _
bear the brunt.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, following a massive exodus of Tutsi from Rwanda
after a series of massacres in the early 1960s, that burden was
carried by neighboring Uganda, which by the 1970s had become the
sick man of the region.
</P>
<P>
   During his own rise to power at the head of a guerrilla
insurgency, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni recruited as many as
a quarter of his fighters from his country's large Tutsi immigrant
population, many of whom were fixated on revenge for Hutu attacks
that had driven them into exile.
</P>
<P>
   Then, shortly after winning power in 1986, Museveni began to
back Tutsi efforts to overthrow the Hutu-led government in Rwanda
by force _ in part to repay a debt to people who had fought at his
side, and in part so as not to be forever saddled with a large
group of foreign exiles whose presence was arousing resentment.
</P>
<P>
   After years of up and down struggle, the Uganda-based Tutsi
fighters triumphed in 1994, capturing the Rwandan capital of Kigali
in a lightning offensive and restoring Tutsi authority over the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of their victory could hardly have been more
tragic, however. The final Tutsi assault on the capital came amid
one of the century's worst bouts of ethnic cleansing, in which Hutu
militias waged a machete-wielding extermination campaign against
ordinary Tutsi. At least half a million people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing the scene of their crime, as many as 2 million Hutu then
left Rwanda, and most settled in the region's newest basket case:
Mobutu's Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   Although few saw it at the time, from that moment the history of
the Congo came to be dominated by the problems of its vastly
smaller neighbor, Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of huge refugee communities quickly upset an
already delicate ethnic balance in eastern Zaire, helping revive
local resentment of anyone seen as Rwandan, especially the
so-called Banyamulenge.
</P>
<P>
   From their sprawling refugee camps where the United Nations fed
them, the Hutu exiles began attacking their homeland, waging
hit-and-run attacks on army posts and butchering innocent
civilians. Their apparent aim was to make Rwanda ungovernable for
the Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda, using as a pretext a regional governor's threat to strip
the Banyamulenge residents of eastern Zaire of their Zairian
citizenship, mounted a scarcely concealed invasion of its western
neighbor aimed at cleaning out the Hutu refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   Mortar attacks near Goma and Bukavu quickly sent at least
200,000 Hutu refugees, including genocidal militiamen hiding among
them, fleeing westward. Another 700,000 Hutu returned home on foot,
preferring to take their chances in Rwanda. As it pursued the Hutu
into the Zairian bush, Rwanda scrambled to hammer together a
coalition of anti-Mobutu forces in the region who could serve as a
front for their invasion.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, the story of how Zaire became Congo is none
other than the story of how Rwanda pursued its civil war in
neighboring territory. As Rwandan-led insurgents chased Hutu
refugees across Zaire, the crumbling of Mobutu's large national
army surprised all involved.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, as the Rwandan-led ``rebellion'' swept Zaire, Kabila,
the Rwandan-selected front man for the invasion, went from being an
obscure and inconsequential Mobutu opponent to
President-in-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   International impatience with Mobutu, who had been promising a
transition to democracy for five years, and a deep streak of
sympathy for Rwanda's Tutsi over the recent genocide, preempted
most criticism of the Rwandan invasion.
</P>
<P>
   If the outside world failed to get upset about Rwanda's Zairian
adventure, in recent months Rwanda itself began to show signs of
disgust at the outcome. Perhaps in anticipation of promised
elections, President Kabila had begun to weed out prominent Tutsi,
who have come to be as resented in Congo as they once were in
Uganda, from his inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Even more seriously from Rwanda's perspective, Kabila has proven
unable to stop raids from eastern Congo by Hutu insurgents that
have turned much of western Rwanda into a killing ground.
</P>
<P>
   Now fighting for its survival against another Rwandan-led
uprising in Congo, Kabila's government has complained bitterly that
the international community has become blind in its sympathy with
Rwanda. Because of the 1994 genocide, Congolese officials say, the
world tolerates adventures by Rwanda in Central Africa that would
be seen as outrageous almost anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be hard to work up much sympathy for Kabila, given that
he allowed himself to be installed by the Rwandans,'' said one
Central African diplomat. ``But what we are all realizing is that
over the long term there is going to be trouble in our region until
the problems of Rwanda itself can be sorted out. And almost no one
seems to focus on that.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ In an era when some of the world's bitterest
disputes have begun to give way to accommodation, the enmity
between India and Pakistan over Kashmir erupted again over the past
10 days in ways that underscored how intractable and potentially
dangerous the confrontation has become, especially since both
countries have now demonstrated their ability to build and detonate
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike hostilities that have yielded, or begun to yield, in
Germany, Ireland, the Middle East and South Africa, those in
Kashmir show every sign of being frozen in time. After 50 years of
division, two wars and ceaseless propaganda, the territory remains
the touchstone of all that sets India and Pakistan apart _ all the
religious, cultural and territorial passions that have raged since
the partition of British India in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   As such, it remains the most likely flashpoint of another war,
one with potential now to involve nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hazards, just about everybody involved, including
ranking Indian and Pakistani officials and Western emissaries who
have talked with both sides, seems to agree that the issue is so
tangled in resentments that there is almost no likelihood of
settlement, and that the 1.1 billion people of Pakistan and India
will stay hostage to the dispute for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   From this pessimistic viewpoint, India will continue to regard
the predominantly Muslim territory as essential to its security and
coherence as a secular state; Pakistan will press, without real
hope of success, for India to honor its pledge in the 1950s to
allow a United Nations-supervised plebiscite among Kashmir's 9
million people to choose between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The latest demonstration of the intransigence on both sides came
in Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, when the two prime ministers,
Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India and Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan, met
during an annual conference of South Asian leaders at the end of
July, only to fall quickly into old arguments over Kashmir. Still
unable to agree even on procedures for discussing the territory,
Vajpayee and Sharif abandoned plans to restart broader negotiations
that have faltered on and off throughout the 1990's.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the leaders reached home, their failure was echoing
in Kashmir. Artillery duels across the 550-mile ``line of control''
that separates the Indian and Pakistani armies reached a new
crescendo, killing dozens of civilians. Before dawn Monday, armed
men identified by Indian police as Kashmiri Muslim rebels crossed
from the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir into the neighboring
Indian state of Himachal Pradesh and opened fire on two groups of
sleeping construction workers. Police said that 34 men, most or all
of them Hindus, died, with a dozen others wounded. Later in the
week, at least another 50 people died in similar attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, at least 30,000 and perhaps 50,000 civilians
have been killed in the Kashmir dispute, most of them victims of
the struggle between Indian forces and Muslim rebels that Pakistan
has armed and financed in the Kashmir Valley, the heartland of the
old, undivided Kashmir. Unable to seriously challenge Indian
control in the valley, the rebels have shifted their attacks
increasingly into less heavily-fortified areas to the south, and
now beyond Kashmir's borders. These forays employ terror tactics,
mostly against Hindus, that have prompted waves of anger across
India.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughter in Himachal Pradesh was at least the seventh such
incident involving unarmed Hindu victims this year. Villagers at a
remote settlement have had their throats cut for refusing to eat
beef on the orders of Muslim rebels, and members of two wedding
parties have been gunned down while waiting for buses to take them
home. Counterpart attacks across the frontier in the Pakistan-ruled
part of Kashmir, with Muslim civilians as victims, have been blamed
by Pakistan on Indian commandos. Although India has denied the
Pakistani allegations, Indian officers acknowledge that commando
missions across the line of control have been one means of
punishing Pakistan for supporting the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the scale of the violence and the risks of a wider
war, Kashmir's miseries have only rarely attracted the attention
that has focused on other long-running international disputes.
Perhaps because it is a small territory, tucked up in the folds of
the Himalayan mountains, and with a history not widely known
outside the region, Kashmir and its problems have been largely a
specialists' domain.
</P>
<P>
   A compelling example was the sporadic interest, at least in the
West, in the plight of six Western tourists, two of them Americans,
who were kidnapped by Muslim rebels while on hiking trips in the
Kashmir Valley in July 1995. One American escaped; a Norwegian was
savagely murdered in the first month, his headless body dumped on a
village path. In 1997, Western diplomats concluded that the other
four hostages _ two Britons, a German and the missing American _
were almost certainly killed in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But how many Americans who had known the name Terry Anderson
could identify Donald Frederick Hutchings, a neuropsychologist from
Spokane, Wash., as the American hostage missing in Kashmir?
</P>
<P>
   This indifference could be jolted if India and Pakistan remain
at an impasse over the territory, and refuse even to discuss it,
raising the risks that the violence may someday provide the spark
for another full-scale war, like the ones that erupted in 1947 and
1965.
</P>
<P>
   Although both nations said after the nuclear tests that they
were ready to negotiate measures that will lessen the risks, even
the kind of ``confidence-building measures'' that helped stabilize
the Cold War will be impossible until negotiations begin; and
those, in turn, are blocked for now by the animosities and
suspicions that envelop Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, some in India and Pakistan question whether the
two governments really want to lessen tensions. Vajpayee served as
foreign minister in the late 1970s _ a time when many in both
countries say relations between India and Pakistan improved more
than at any time since 1947. But he is today the parliamentary
leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, a Hindu nationalist group
that has never truly forgiven Pakistan for the partition of 1947.
</P>
<P>
   In its five months in power, Vajpayee's 14-party coalition has
tottered from one domestic crisis to another, causing Indian
skeptics to worry that party hard-liners might welcome renewed
hostilities in Kashmir for the political boost it might give them
among India's 700-million Hindus.
</P>
<P>
   And Sharif, like every Pakistani leader, has shown an instinct
to stoke up tensions over Kashmir whenever his domestic problems
mount. He reaped a surge in popular backing after ordering
Pakistan's nuclear tests in May, but his support has since
plummeted across his country, largely because of a weak economy
made worse by international sanctions imposed after the tests.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombo, even Pakistani journalists accused Sharif of
``playing the Kashmir card,'' meaning that he used the Kashmir
issue to block any move toward lessening tensions with India,
partly in the hope of boosting his popularity at home.

 UH. TODAY'S KIDS ARE, LIKE, KILLING THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. YEAH,
RIGHT.

(Repeating for all needing. Originally file on Saturday, August (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a father of two pre-teen boys, I have in the last year or so
become a huge fan of the word ``duh.'' This is a word much maligned
by educators, linguistic brahmins and purists, but they are all
quite wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Duh has elegance. Duh has shades of meaning, even
sophistication. Duh and its perfectly paired linguistic partner,
``yeah right,'' are the ideal terms to usher in the millennium and
the information age, and to highlight the differences from the
stolid old 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Even my sons might stop me at this point and quash my hyperbole
with a quickly dispensed, ``Yeah, right, Dad.'' But hear me out: I
have become convinced that duh and yeah right have arisen to fill a
void in the language because the world has changed. Fewer questions
these days can effectively be answered with yes or no, while at the
same time, a tidal surge of hype and mindless blather threatens to
overwhelm old-fashioned conversation. Duh and yeah right are the
cure.
</P>
<P>
   Good old yes and no were fine for their time _ the archaic,
black-and-white era of late industrialism that I was born into in
the 1950s. The yes-or-no combo was hard and fast and most of all
simple: It belonged to the Manichean red-or-dead mentality of the
cold war, to manufacturing, to ``Father Knows Best'' and ``It's a
Wonderful Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The information-age future that my 11-year-old twins own is more
complicated than yes or no. It's more subtle and supple, more
loaded with content and hype and media manipulation than my
childhood _ or any adult's, living or dead _ ever was.
</P>
<P>
   And duh, whatever else it may be, is drenched with content.
Between them, duh and yeah-right are capable of dividing all
language and thought into an exquisitely differentiated universe.
Every statement and every question can be positioned on a gray
scale of understatement or overstatement, stupidity or
insightfulness, information saturation or yawning emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   And in an era when plain speech has become endangered by the
pressures of political correctness, duh and yeah right are
matchless tools of savvy, winking sarcasm and skepticism: caustic
without being confrontational, incisive without being quite
specific.
</P>
<P>
   With duh, you can convey a response, throw in a whole basket
full of auxiliary commentary about the question or the statement
you're responding to, and insult the speaker all at once! As in
this hypothetical exchange:
</P>
<P>
   Parent: ``Good morning, son, it's a beautiful day.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven-year-old boy: ``Duh.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is a kind of esthetic balance as well. Yeah-right is
the yin to duh's yang, the antithesis to duh's emphatic thesis.
Where duh is assertive and edgy, a perfect tool for undercutting
mindless understatement or insulting repetition, yeah right is laid
back, a surfer's cool kind of response to anything overwrought or
oversold.
</P>
<P>
   New York, for example, is duh territory, while Los Angeles is
yeah-right. Television commercials can be rendered harmless and
inert by simply saying, ``yeah, right,'' upon their conclusion.
Local television news reports are helped out with a sprinkling of
well placed duhs, at moments of stunning obviousness. And almost
any politician's speech cries out for heaping helpings of both at
various moments.
</P>
<P>
   Adolescent terms like ``like,'' by contrast, scare me to death.
While I have become convinced through observation and personal
experimentation that just about any adult of even modest
intelligence can figure out how to use duh and yeah right properly,
like is different. Like is hard. Like is, like, dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Danesi, a professor of linguistics and semiotics at the
University of Toronto who has studied the language of youth and who
coined the term ``pubilect'' to describe the dialect of pubescence,
said he believes like is in fact altering the structure of the
English language, making it more fluid in construction, more like
Italian or some other Romance language than good old hard-and-fast
Anglo-Saxon. Insert like in the middle of a sentence, he said, and
a statement can be turned into a question, a question into an
exclamation, an exclamation into a quiet meditation.
</P>
<P>
   Consider these hypothetical expressions: ``If you're having
broccoli for dinner, Johnson, I'm, like, out of here!'' and ``I
was, like, no way!'' and, perhaps most startlingly, ``He was, like,
duh!''
</P>
<P>
   In the broccoli case, like softens the sentence. It's less harsh
and confrontational than saying flatly that the serving of an
unpalatable vegetable would require a fleeing of the premises.
</P>
<P>
   In the second instance, like functions as a kind of a verbal
quotation mark, an announcement that what follows, ``no way,'' is
to be heard differently. The quote itself can then be loaded up
with any variety of intonation _ irony, sarcasm, even
self-deprecation _ all depending on the delivery.
</P>
<P>
   In the third example _ ``He was, like, duh!'' _ like becomes a
crucial helping verb for duh, a verbal springboard. (Try saying the
sentence without like and it becomes almost incomprensible.)
</P>
<P>
   But like and duh and yeah right, aside from their purely
linguistic virtues, are also in many ways the perfect words to
convey the sense of reflected reality that is part of the age we
live in. Image manipulation, superficiality, and shallow media
culture are, for better or worse, the backdrop of adolescent life.
</P>
<P>
   Adults of the yes-or-no era could perhaps grow up firm in their
knowledge of what things ``are,'' but in the Age of Duh, with
images reflected back from every angle at every waking moment, kids
swim in a sea of what things are ``like.'' Distinguishing what is
from what merely seems to be is a required skill of an 11-year-old
today; like reflects modern life, and duh and yeah right are the
tools with which such a life can be negotiated and mastered.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a concealed paradox in the Age of Duh. The
information overload on which it is based is built around the
computer, and the computer is, of course, built around _ that's
right _ the good old yes-or-no binary code: Billions of
microcircuits all blinking on or off, black or white, current in or
current out. Those computers were designed by minds schooled and
steeped in the world of yes or no, and perhaps it is not too much
of a stretch to imagine my sons' generation, shaped by the broader
view of duh, finding another path: binary code with attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, most computers I know already seem to have an attitude.
Incorporating a little duh would at least give them a sense of
humor.

TERRORISM AGAINST THE U.S.: A SCORECARD  
 (The Week in Review)  
 (Duplication warning: also sent with `a' code)  
 (HLW)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hours after the deadly car bombings at the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania on Friday, President Clinton vowed to hunt down
those responsible ``no matter what or how long it takes.'' But
history suggests it can take a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   When terrorists take aim at Americans abroad, the perpetrators
are rarely identified with any certainty and seldom caught or
punished _ almost always because of the complications of joint
investigations with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   This time U.S. officials hope for better cooperation in what the
State Department described as the first nearly simultaneous
terrorist attacks in separate countries. The bombs, apparently in
vehicles parked outside the embassies, killed more than 60 in
Nairobi, including eight Americans. Another 1,100 people were
injured. At least nine people were killed in Dar es Salaam, none
American, and scores were injured.

   The Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia in June 1996 is a grim
example of the difficulties of solving a case: A truck bomb
detonated at an apartment building, killing 19 U.S. airmen. The
second anniversary of that attack passed two months ago with U.S.
authorities expressing exasperation over their inability to
identify those involved, and admitting privately that the
investigation had collapsed because of disputes with Saudi
investigators.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The following is a review of the federal government's progress
in some of the major terrorist attacks against Americans in the
1980s and 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Date: April 1983
</P>
<P>
   Event: U.S. Embassy in Beirut is bombed.
</P>
<P>
   Death toll: 16 killed.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects: Elements of the Lebanese Party of God, the militant
Iranian- and Syrian-backed terrorist group, led by Imad Mughniyah.
</P>
<P>
   Status: No arrests or convictions. Many of the terrorists
involved in the plot are believed to be living in Lebanon. The FBI
nearly captures Mughniyah in 1995 after the bureau learns that he
is aboard a commercial jet that is scheduled to make a stopover in
Saudi Arabia. At the last minute, the Saudis refuse to allow the
plane to land, and it goes on to Beirut. The United States protests
to the Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   Date: October 1983
</P>
<P>
   Event: U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut is bombed.
</P>
<P>
   Death toll: 241.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects: Elements of Lebanese Party of God led by Imad
Mughniyah.
</P>
<P>
   Status: No arrests or convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Date: June 1985
</P>
<P>
   Event: TWA Flight 847 is hijacked en route from Athens to Rome
and forced to land in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Death toll: One, an American, Robert Dean Stethem, who is shot,
his body dumped on the airport tarmac in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects: Elements of Party of God, led by Imad Mugniyah.
</P>
<P>
   Status: No arrests or convictions in American courts. Charges
brought against four people, including Mugniyah, in a sealed
indictment in the United States. One of the hijackers, Mohammed Ali
Hamadi, is arrested on terrorist charges in Germany in 1987 and
convicted there for Stethem's murder. He is sentenced to life in
prison. Germany refuses American requests for extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Date: October 1985
</P>
<P>
   Event: Four gunmen hijack Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro off
the Egyptian Coast, demanding release of Palestinian prisoners in
Egypt, Italy and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Death toll: One, Leon Klinghoffer, a 69-year-old disabled
American tourist is killed, his body dumped into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects: The Palestine Liberation Front, allied at times with
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Status: No arrests or convictions in American courts. After the
hijackers give up the ship and depart Egypt by air, their plane is
intercepted by Navy fighters over the Mediterranean and forced down
in Italy. The four hijackers are convicted by Italy in 1986 but two
escape from prison. One, Magid Molgi, who confesses to killing
Klinghoffer, is caught and returned to prison. The man identified
as the mastermind of the hijacking, Abul Abbas, is released by
Italy despite Washington's pleas that he be held for trial. Last
seen in 1996 in Gaza, where he attends a meeting of the Palestine
National Council.
</P>
<P>
   Date: November 1985
</P>
<P>
   Event: Egypt Air Flight 648 is hijacked on a flight from Athens
to Cairo and lands in Malta. The hijackers kill two passengers (an
American and an Israeli) before Egyptian police raid the plane.
Fifty-eight others die in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Death toll: 60.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects: Palestinian hijackers say they are members of a group
called Egypt's Revolution, but Abu Nidal's Arab Revolutionary
Command issues statement taking responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Status: Only one of the hijackers, Mohammed Ali Rezaq, survives
the raid. After an 11-year diplomatic struggle, Rezaq is captured
by the FBI in Nigeria in 1986 and brought to the United States for
trial. He is convicted and sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Date: April 1986
</P>
<P>
   Event: West Berlin night club popular among American troops is
bombed.
</P>
<P>
   Death toll: Three, two of them American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects: A Libyan diplomat, two Palestinians and two Germans
are on trial in Germany for the attack. German prosecutors say they
were acting on orders from Libyan intelligence. As a result of
attack, President Reagan orders air strike on Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Status: No arrests or convictions in American courts.
</P>
<P>
   Date: April 1986
</P>
<P>
   Event: Bomb explodes aboard a TWA jet en route from Rome to
Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Death toll: Four American passengers, including an 18-month-old
infant, who were sucked out of the plane at 10,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects: Mohammed Rashid, a Palestinian terrorist, and other
members of the Iraqi-backed May 15 organization, named after the
date of Israel's founding.
</P>
<P>
   Status: Rashid is captured in Greece in 1988 and convicted there
on terrorism charges. Released in 1996 for good behavior and
travels to Egypt. In June, FBI agents apprehend Rashid in Egypt and
bring him to the United States for trial in connection with 1982
bombing of Pan Am jet in which a Japanese citizen is killed.
</P>
<P>
   Date: February 1988
</P>
<P>
   Event: Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, a member of the U.N.
peacekeeping force, is kidnapped and executed in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>

Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Death toll: 270, including 11 people on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects: Libyan intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
   Status: No arrests or convictions. American and British
investigators locate a fingernail sized piece of a bomb timer,
tracing it through its manufacturers to two Libyan intelligence
officers, Abdel Basset Al Megrahi and Lamen Kahlifa Fhimah. They
are indicted in United States and placed on FBI's Most Wanted List,
with $4-million reward offered. Libya refuses to turn them over for
trial in American court.
</P>
<P>
   Date: March 1995

<P>
   Event: Two American diplomats driving to work at the U.S.
Consulate in Karachi, Pakistan, are killed.
</P>
<P>
   Death toll: Two.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects: Unclear, although FBI studies possible link between
murders and arrest in Pakistan several weeks earlier of Ramzi Ahmed
Yousef, later convicted as mastermind of World Trade Center
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Status: No arrests or convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Date: November 1995
</P>
<P>
   Event: An American government-run military training center in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, is bombed.

VANESSA WILLIAMS DANCES UP A STORM 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a color slide of Vanessa Williams in a scene from ``Dance
With Me.'' 
 (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 &HT;     For release Aug. 10 and thereafter 
 &HT;     By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 &HT;    World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The ground has always rumbled at a certain airplane hangar
outside of Los Angeles. But on the set of ``Dance With Me,'' the
place is set to rumba.
 &HT;    Vanessa Williams, her eyes wide, stands in the corner of what
has been transformed into a giant ballroom set. She gives the come
hither look to a hot Latin pop star who only goes by one name. He
is Chayanne, a man who is about to teach the former Miss America
that salsa is much more than a dip.
 &HT;    There will be a lot of dipping. And kissing. And hips that seem
to fit together like Leggos.
 &HT;    As sexy Spanish music plays, Chayanne approaches Williams and
begins his move. He doesn't move his mouth. Words are not
necessary. His look says it all.
 &HT;    His arm snakes around her waist. Hips swaying, her blue
high-slit dress gives the camera a leg shot. Williams doesn't
notice because her arms are around his neck. Feet pivot. Hips
grind. He grabs her shoulder. He drapes a hand around her front.
 &HT;    But the moment is short lived. Suddenly, he dips her. At almost
cement level, her head pops up and he kisses her on the lips.
 &HT;    The feeling here is hot. That's the point of ``Dance With Me,''
which opens Aug. 21. It's a love story between a competitive
ballroom dancer (Williams) and a Cuban emigre (Chayanne). It's
directed by Randa Haines, who directed ``Children of a Lesser God''
(1986) with William Hurt and Marlee Matlin.
 &HT;    Haines was introduced to the film's screenwriter and
choreographer Daryl Matthews almost a decade ago at a Cuban dance
club. ``I was determined to make a film that really showed people
how to dance,'' Haines says.
 &HT;    You won't hear Williams complaining about shaking her tail in
the movie. ``I've studied dance my entire life,'' Williams says.
``This movie was a dream come true for a little girl who used to
run around her room pretending that she was part of a chorus
line.''
 &HT;    Williams, 35, never experienced the thrill of Latin dancing. So,
before cameras rolled, Williams threw herself into classes to learn
the rumba, samba and cha-cha. ``I sound like I could open my own
Arthur Murrays,'' she groans. ``I also learned how to fox trot and
swing. On some nights, I would go home swearing I couldn't walk let
alone dance again.''
 &HT;    Then again, Williams started filming ``Dance With Me'' only a
few weeks after wrapping last fall's ``Soul Food.''
 &HT;    ``Please, on `Soul Food,' I was taking home huge peach pies with
me. I just want to say that me alone on location in a hotel room
with an entire pie is not a pretty thing.'' For her art, she had to
eat heaping platters of fried chicken, yams and collard greens, for
three months straight.
 &HT;    ``Frankly, I was delighted to get the part in `Dance With Me'
for a very selfish reason,'' Williams says. ``I gained a few pounds
on `Soul Food,' and I learned that Cuban dancing is better than
aerobics for burning calories.''
 &HT;    She didn't feel self-conscious in front of Chayanne, a man so
handsome he could lead the Hollywood Hunk parade. With over 4
million in Latin America record sales, ``Dance With Me'' marks the
singer-actor's American movie debut.
 &HT;    ``I was really nervous,'' he says, ``but Vanessa put me at ease
every single day. She was always there to answer my questions.''
 &HT;    These days it's Williams who is being questioned about the
dancing duo. Oprah asked her if working with Chayanne was like
getting a megadose of Viagra. ``He's so sexy,'' she says. ``I don't
think any Viagra is needed.''
 &HT;    No slouch herself in that department, Williams seems the most
secure she has ever been.
 &HT;    Williams is a pro at facing tough problems. As the first black
Miss America, she endured hate mail from white supremacists and
from blacks claiming that she was too white.
 &HT;    Williams will forever live in infamy as having been forced to
resign and turn in her crown in 1984. That happened after Penthouse
printed nude photos of her taken several years earlier.
 &HT;    ``I was 21 years old when I started seeing my face on the news
every night and these horrible stories printed about me,'' she
says. ``Now I look back, and I can't believe I got through what was
the worst time in my life. I think I was in shock and maybe that
helped. I just took it day-by-day.''
 &HT;    Williams could write a book about turning a scandal to your
advantage. Her first move was all but vanishing from the public
eye. She skipped apologies and dodged interview requests. Williams
wasn't hiding out. ``I went back to work. It was all that I could
do.''
 &HT;    During that period, she recorded her first solo album. ``The
Right Stuff,'' released in 1988, sold 500,000 copies. To critics
who cried fluke, she delivered a second hit. ``My mentality is that
I would show them,'' she says.
 &HT;    Showing them included a stint on Broadway where Williams
received rave reviews in ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' (1995). She
followed that in the film ``The Pick-Up Artist'' (1987).
 &HT;    Later, she was hired by Disney to sing the Oscar winning song
``Colors of the Wind'' for its animated movie ``Pocohontas''
(1996). Williams portrayed a woman on the lam with Arnold
Schwarzenegger in ``Eraser'' (1996), a gangster moll in ``Hoodlum''
(1997) and starred in several TV mini series including ``The
Odyssey'' and ``Bye, Bye Birdie'' (both 1997).
 &HT;    ``As a kid, I always wanted to do it all,'' she says. ``I
thought the perfect job was something where I could sing and dance
and act.''
 &HT;    It isn't easy to have those ambitions when you are a young girl
growing up in Millwood, N.Y., a New York suburb. Williams
discovered the arts because her parents are accomplished music
teachers. ``I think in the back of my mind as a kid was the plan to
be a dancer in a big Broadway show.''
 &HT;    She didn't dream of her name in lights. ``I was never the
show-offy type of child who practiced an Oscar speech in front of a
mirror,'' Williams says. ``I was content to just be a tiny part of
the background if I got to sing and dance.''
 &HT;    Her career began quicker than expected. She won a theater
scholarship to Syracuse University, but on her first day there she
learned the money was gone. Not giving up, she looked for ways to
make money.
 &HT;    Although her heart wasn't in it, she decided that beauty
pageants might be a solution. ``I can't even tell you how surprised
I was when I kept winning. I never thought of myself as the type,''
Williams says.
 &HT;    A way to earn school money nearly wrecked her life, but Williams
thanks her mother for giving her a tough backbone. ``She drilled
something into me as a little girl. She would say, `Vanessa, as a
black woman, you will always have to do better than anyone else
just to be considered equal.'
 &HT;    ``I always knew that I would have to work and work harder than
anyone else to get a shot. That sort of philosophy really paid off
in Hollywood.''
 &HT;    There have been disappointments. Williams is divorced from her
husband of 10 years, Ramon Hervey, her mentor and manager after the
scandal. These days, she lives quietly.
 &HT;    ``I'm with someone special,'' she says, insisting that is all
she will say about her love life. She is more apt to gush about her
children, Melanie, 11, Jillian, 9 and Devin, 5. ``I look at them
and I see the future. Having children is the biggest accomplishment
of my life, and the best job is being a mother.''
 &HT;    Just because she's a mom doesn't mean she is home baking cookies
every night. While filming ``Dance With Me,'' she was shaking with
Chayanne.
 &HT;    ``It was a tough job, but someone had to do it,'' Williams says,
adding that when he would shimmy next to her, ``My pulse went up.
Way, way up.''
 &HT;    For his part, Chayanne insists, ``Vanessa makes me
hyperventilate.'' He rattles off a list of her attributes and ends
with past the highest compliment.
 &HT;    ``She even smells great sweating.''

ALAN ARKIN'S A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a color slide of Alan Arkin in a scene from ``Slums of
Beverly Hills.'' 
 &HT;     For release Aug. 10 and thereafter 
 (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 &HT;     By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Alan Arkin was never one to be the Bruce Willis or Steve McQueen
of his day. Not that there's anything wrong with that.
 &HT;    In fact, the veteran actor is just fine with that. Versatility
and longevity are his forte.
 &HT;    ``What do I do for a living?'' asks Arkin, the noted stage and
screen actor, but also more than a dabbler in directing, singing,
playing guitar, and writing novels, stage pieces and children's
songs.
 &HT;    ``Ninety-five percent of my income comes from acting, so I'd
have to call myself an actor.''
 &HT;    Arkin, 64, perched comfortably on a couch at the Rihga Royal
Hotel in Manhattan, softens his well-tanned poker face with a
whimsical smile.
 &HT;    ``In a perfect world, 95 percent of my income would come from a
trust fund,'' he says. ``I don't know if I'd like to make the same
money doing one of the other things I do.
 &HT;    ``I like acting, but I also like that most of my life is a
surprise to me. I don't know from day to day if I'll be acting or
directing, or if an idea for writing something will come to me.
 &HT;    ``I love that I don't decide anything. The only thing I ever
decided to do was act _ when I was 5 _ and everything else just
happened.''
 &HT;    The latest things to just happen are the film ``Slums of Beverly
Hills'' and the off-Broadway play ``Power Plays.'' ``Slums'' begins
a slow roll-out into theaters Aug. 21, while ``Plays'' is currently
running.
 &HT;    A semi autobiographical comedy-drama written and directed by
first-timer Tamara Jenkins, ``Slums'' casts Arkin as Murray,
patriarch of the Abramowitz family.
 &HT;    A loving, if ever-bickering group, the Abramowitzes _ divorced,
financially struggling dad Murray, on-the-cusp-of-womanhood
daughter Vivian (Natasha Lyonne), sons Ben (David Krumholtz) and
Rickey (Eli Marienthal) and offbeat cousin Rita (Marisa Tomei) _
wander from low-rent hotel to hotel in 1970s Beverly Hills, hoping
for better days and clinging desperately to their dignity and zip
code.
 &HT;    ``I like Murray because he's a complicated man, a guy who's
trying to do good at great cost to himself,'' Arkin says. ``He's
one of these guys who tries to maintain a vision of himself as he'd
like to be.
 &HT;    ``He can't stop thinking of himself as a high-roller and a
businessman to be reckoned with, which he's not anymore and never
really was.
 &HT;    Tamara based Murray on her own father, but she was very flexible
and not overattached to the idea of making me make Murray her
father on screen.''
 &HT;    As the cast's most experienced actor, Arkin often found himself
surrounded by his co-stars. They sought advice, either about their
roles or acting in general, or wanted to pick Arkin's brain about
his experiences in Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``I guess I was the father figure on the set,'' he says,
laughing. ``But I didn't look at it that way.
 &HT;    ``To me, they were all my peers. Natasha is sensational, and
everyone else was there because Tamara believed in them and thought
they were right for their (respective) roles.
 &HT;    ``Everybody worked well together and got on very well. It was
magic when Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno (as Murray's rich brother
and his wife) came in, because all we did was crack up and tell
very old stories, and I think everyone enjoyed that ... except
Tamara, who couldn't get a word in edgewise.''
 &HT;    Reiner worked with Arkin on Arkin's Broadway and film debuts,
``Enter Laughing'' and ``The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are
Coming'' (1966). Arkin and Moreno shared the screen in ``Popi''
(1969).
 &HT;    It was old times for Arkin on another level, too.
 &HT;    ``We shot a couple of scenes five blocks from where I grew up as
a kid, in Highland Park, Los Angeles,'' he says, relishing the
memory. ``Those were the formative days when I was desperate to act
and never dreamed anything would happen for me.
 &HT;    ``While we were shooting these scenes for `Slums,' I could
constantly look up at the hill where I lived and I could bridge my
life.
 &HT;    ``It was as if I were saying hello to somebody from 40 years
ago. If somebody told that kid that he'd turn into me now, I'd be
surprised and happy.
 &HT;    ``My life has taken a lot of turns I never expected,'' Arkin
says, ``but I guess that's true of everyone.''
 &HT;    Not everyone, though, pursued acting by age 12. Not everyone can
lay claim to serving as an original member of Chicago's famed
Second City theatrical revue.
 &HT;    Not everyone counts among their credits such films as ``Wait
Until Dark'' (1967), ``Little Murders'' (1971, which he directed),
``The In-laws'' (1979), ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' (1992), such TV
movies as ``The Defection of Simas Kudirka'' (1978) and
``Cooperstown'' (1993), and innumerable plays, many of which he
directed.
 &HT;    ``I'll give you that,'' Arkin says as modestly as possible. ``I
felt like I was born during my Second City days.
 &HT;    ``You get 50 years of training in a year, and in one night you
were forced to play 30 or 40 different characters. Audiences
recognized that you'd fail 40 percent of the time and didn't mind
because that was a part of the experience.
 &HT;    ``We've reached a dangerous state in the U.S. now and that's
that you're not allowed to fail,'' he says. ``At Second City, you
were not only allowed to fail, you expected to fail.
 &HT;    ``That gave everyone an enormous opportunity for
experimentation. We were our own writers and directors, and we did
workshops and performances, which meant we were working all the
time.''
 &HT;    Versatility became Arkin's calling card, and that remains the
case. Is he a dramatic actor adept at comedy? Or a comedian who can
handle drama?
 &HT;    ``I don't think in those terms,'' he says instantly. ``I try to
fulfill whatever the part is that I'm given.
 &HT;    ``If people think of me as a jack-of-all-trades, it means I get
to do a little of everything. Every actor should want that.
 &HT;    ``I'd be bored doing one kind of role all my life. These days,
I'm doing big films and little films, serious parts and lighter
parts, plays and whatever else I want.
 &HT;    ``I used to be obsessive about acting, to the point that it was
crucial that I work. These days, I actually enjoy it more than ever
because I'm not as concerned about there being as much at stake for
me.''
 &HT;    Arkin will next be seen opposite Robin Williams in ``Jacob the
Liar,'' a film set in a Jewish ghetto during the Holocaust, but he
plans to take a two-month rest once ``Power Plays'' ends this
summer.
 &HT;    The actor, separated from wife Barbara Dana, hopes to relax at
home in Connecticut, visit his three sons (Adam of ``Chicago
Hope,'' ``Power Plays'' co-star Anthony and Matthew), and indulge
in his passion for photography.
 &HT;    ``After that, my phone will hopefully ring with someone asking
me to be in something,'' Arkin says. ``If not, I'll create
something for myself.''
 &HT;    So what, then, if Arkin never emerged as the McQueen or Willis
of his day?
 &HT;    He's doing just fine, thank you very much.
 &HT;    ``I have no complaints. I don't think I could do what Willis
does or what McQueen did, and I'm not sure they could do what I
do,'' he says. ``To be honest, I don't know that I'd want to do
what they do and I'm really not so sure they'd want to do what I
do.''

 &HT;     By JEAN OPPENHEIMER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    They were the essence of cool, smoking, drinking martinis,
carousing, busting up clubs, sleeping with any women they wanted.
 &HT;    They were the Rat Pack _ Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis
Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop _ and they defined the term
``hip'' from the late 1950s to the early 1960s. ``They were the
rock stars of that time,'' says Don Cheadle, who portrays Davis in
``The Rat Pack.''
 &HT;    An original HBO Pictures drama premiering Aug. 22, ``The Rat
Pack'' explores the relationships between the men, the glamour and
glitz of their lives, and the sometimes dark reality behind the
facade.
 &HT;    ``It's not a tell-all or a nasty kind of thing,'' emphasizes Ray
Liotta, who plays Sinatra. ``Hopefully it's a fairly accurate
portrayal of these guys at a particular time in their lives.''
 &HT;    Sinatra is the central character, and Liotta (``Copland,'' 1997
and ``Goodfellas,'' 1990) admits it was an intimidating role.
 &HT;    ``I didn't want to just do the angry Frank, the Frank who beat
up photographers, the Frank who drank,'' he says. ``Sure, that was
part of it, as much as his generosity, as much as he fought against
racism, as much as the love of his friends. That's the Frank we
wanted to tell.''
 &HT;    A major focus is Sinatra's admiration for John F. Kennedy. An
early JFK supporter, Sinatra worked to get him elected. Sinatra
reconciled with Peter Lawford, then married to Pat Kennedy, to get
close to JFK. The actors hadn't spoken in eight years, since
Lawford had dinner with Ava Gardner after she divorced Sinatra.
 &HT;    Lawford claimed it was a ploy by studio publicists, but Sinatra
didn't believe him and cut him out of his life. Sinatra's desire to
get close to Kennedy was so strong that he engineered a
rapprochement.
 &HT;    As the film shows, Sinatra used his popularity and underworld
connections to help Kennedy get elected, only to be discarded when
he was no longer useful. Bobby Kennedy considered Sinatra a
liability, partially because of his relationship with alleged mafia
figures, but also because of his friendship with Davis, who was
engaged to marry Swedish actress May Britt.
 &HT;    ``This interracial marriage was a real problem for the Kennedy
campaign, which was in the middle of trying to win the South,''
remarks Rob Cohen, who directed ``The Rat Pack'' and previously did
``Dragon: the Bruce Lee Story'' (1993).
 &HT;    ``It became really contentious political fodder because Frank,
who was going to be best man at the wedding, is suddenly the most
visible member of the campaign.''
 &HT;    ``Lawford came to Frank with a message from Joe Kennedy: If
Sinatra shows up at the wedding, he is finished with the
Kennedys,'' Cohen says. ``Frank is really being twisted. And Sammy
is calling from Washington D.C., where he is playing a date and
being picketed by neo-Nazis, and Frank is telling him, `Forget that
stuff. I'm going to be there.' There is so much going on in this
movie that people don't know about.''
 &HT;    The movie also chronicles Sinatra's final split with Lawford.
After his election, Kennedy visited California. Sinatra expanded
his estate to make room for the Secret Service and a presidential
visit, but was told JFK would stay with Bing Crosby, a Republican
who did nothing to get Kennedy elected.
 &HT;    ``It hurt Frank so much, he just went beserk,'' Cohen says. ``He
turned on Lawford _ the messenger carrying the bad news _ and
bodily threw him down the stairs of his house.''
 &HT;    British actor Angus Macfadyen (``Braveheart,'' 1995), who plays
Lawford, recoils at the cruelty he sees in Sinatra's treatment of
Lawford. ``Ten years later Lawford went to Las Vegas with his new
wife to where Frank was singing and Frank refused to go on until
they were removed.''
 &HT;    Each actor has a different perspective on the Rat Pack.
 &HT;    Macfadyen deplores the monstrous egos he found. ``There always
seemed to be a shallow quality to their lives. It was all facade.
They were like children who never grew up.''
 &HT;    Liotta is more forgiving, lamenting that people too often focus
on Sinatra's negative side. The actor remembers an interview
Sinatra gave to Walter Cronkite on the singer's 50th birthday.
 &HT;    Most of the questions were about his relationships with the mob
or when he hit a journalist. ``The interview wasn't about his fund
raising or about the short film he produced about kids picking on
another kid,'' Liotta says. ``The movie won an Oscar.'' (Sinatra
also received an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor in 1953's
``From Here To Eternity.'')
 &HT;    Cheadle (TV's ``Picket Fences'' and the film ``Out of Sight,''
1998) offers perhaps the most poignant view: ``I think these men
really dug each other. I think they really were close.''
 &HT;    Sinatra and Davis seemed to have a genuinely close relationship.
Sinatra first saw the younger entertainer perform as part of trio
with his father and uncle. Sinatra recognized Davis' talent and
started getting him into clubs. They became fast friends.
 &HT;    Cheadle, who learned to tap dance and play the drums for his
role, recites a quote he heard about the group: ```Sammy always
wanted to be Frank and Frank always wanted to be Dean and Dean
always just wanted to be left alone.' And that's really how you see
them in this movie. Sammy really looked up to Frank, Frank was
always trying to be as cool as Dean, and Dean was always `I don't
care about any of it.'''
 &HT;    Martin, portrayed by Joe Mantegna, is the group's mystery man.
``Like everything with Dean, he was in it but not of it,'' Cohen
says. ``He kept a kind of dispassionate distance.'' (Mantegna's
previous credits include ``Searching for Bobby Fischer,'' 1993 and
``The Godfather Part III,'' 1990).
 &HT;    Martin already enjoyed the outer trappings of success _ thanks
to the celebrity he achieved with Jerry Lewis _ and he wasn't
interested in it anymore.
 &HT;    ``Dean had had it all,'' Cohen says. ``That's why he seemed so
cool and easy. And the drunk thing was all a big act. He used to
drink apple juice on stage, not alcohol.''
 &HT;    Lauren Bacall is credited with giving the Rat Pack its nickname.
She and Humphrey Bogart were part of a group who played cards
together, although they were better known for carousing and
thumbing their noses at society.
 &HT;    Sinatra was a junior member. Legend has it that one night the
gang was drinking at Chasen's, a popular entertainment crowd
hangout, when Bacall looked around and remarked, ``You know, you
all look like a bunch of drowned rats.'' The name stuck.
 &HT;    When Bogart died, leadership fell to Sinatra. He and his cronies
became the second generation of Rat Packers.
 &HT;    Politically and historically, they lived through momentous
times. The Civil Rights movement was underway and the Rat Pack
helped break color lines, pushing the envelope with their
satirical, but always affectionate, racial humor. ``Dean and Frank
called each other `wop' and `dago,' Joey Bishop was `the skinny
Jew' and Sammy was `smokey' or 'the colored guy,''' Cheadle says.
 &HT;    ``Back then it was so taboo to say those words, but audiences
laughed, partially as a release of tension and partially because
they couldn't believe somebody was saying those things,'' he says.
``If there had been any real mean-spiritness or hatred, it wouldn't
have been funny.''
 &HT;    That kind of humor doesn't play as well today, and members of
the viewing audience may be offended. In fact, musicians hired to
appear in one of the scenes, were displeased.
 &HT;    ``You could hear them grousing and moaning at every line,''
Cheadle says. ``We had to tell them, `In 1958, people were cracking
up at these lines.'''
 &HT;    Cohen sees the story, particularly Sinatra's part, as a Greek
tragedy. ``He was an extremely sensitive man,'' notes the director.
 &HT;    ``He was easily hurt, easily angered, very generous, incredibly
passionate and, at times, extremely self-destructive.
 &HT;    ``He called himself `an 18-carat depressive.' When he was down,
he was in the depths. And when he was high, he was elated. He was a
man of enormous talents and enormous flaws and the interaction
between the two is what made him the icon we have come to love and
will never lose.''

 &HT;     By STEPHEN COLE  
 &HT;     (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Director Barry Sonnenfeld left marching orders for cast members
Beau Bridges and Liz Vassey on the first day of shooting for
``Maximum Bob,'' ABC's ambitious new one-hour comedy-drama series.
 &HT;    ``A lot of the stuff you'll be doing is pretty over-the-top and
crazy, but don't fool around or act like you get the joke, because
then the series just won't work,'' Sonnenfeld (``Men in Black,''
1997 and ``Get Shorty,'' 1995) told his cast.
 &HT;    Over-the-top is right. The Aug. 4 pilot opened with a mermaid
downing a banana in a vast, spectator-lined aquarium at the Weeki
Wachee Spring amusement park. Seconds later, an alligator attempts
to down her.
 &HT;    Then, before you can say Elmore Leonard, we're transported to a
backward Florida town populated by a gallery of funhouse mirror
grotesques, including a mambo-dancing sheriff and an environmental
extremist who ``kaboom!'' likes to blow up cars.
 &HT;    Bridges presides over the town as a sex-starved, right-wing
magistrate (called Maximum Bob because of his penchant for handing
out stiff sentences), who is running for office and away from his
wife ... who, by the way, is also the banana-gobbling mermaid.
 &HT;    Yes, Elmore Leonard has finally made it to TV. The series, which
is based on the author's 1991 best seller, is the loopiest venture
to hit prime time since Agent Cooper rode out of ``Twin Peaks'' in
the summer of 1991.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, we have some trepidations about whether the general
public will accept us,'' admits Vassey, who plays Maximum Bob's
nemesis, a public defender who is all that prevents Bob from maybe
taking over the world.
 &HT;    ``This is such a quirky show that there's a small fear people
won't get it. At the same time, everyone complains about TV being
too much of the same thing,'' she says. ``Well, `Maximum Bob' isn't
more of the same ... For an actor, this is a dream show: an
inventive, quality series that challenges and excites you every
morning you show up for work.''
 &HT;    Vassey should know about dream shows. The California actress,
who recently starred in ``Brotherly Love,'' has worked on some of
the biggest hits in TV history, including ``ER'' and ``All My
Children,'' for which she earned an Emmy nomination. She's also
guested on ``Cheers,'' ``Murphy Brown'' and ``Home Improvement.''
 &HT;    Still, nothing prepared her for the maximum pace of ``Maximum
Bob.'' ``Barry Sonnenfeld and the other directors and writers _
many of whom have come from ``The Larry Sanders Show'' by the way _
have really set out to make a feature-film caliber movie with every
episode,'' Vassey explains.
 &HT;    ``That means a lot of work. A lot of little touches. Each
episode is the result of eight straight 14-hour days ... It's
grueling because so little of what we shoot seems to be straight
forward dialogue.''
 &HT;    Vassey hasn't had to wrestle any alligators yet, but one episode
had her going a few rounds with a jumbo Rottweiler.
 &HT;    ``It was huge _ 120 pounds of solid muscle,'' she says. ``And
the only way you could get it to behave was to toss it a hot dog
before every shot.''
 &HT;    The actress makes it clear she prefers going one-on-one with
Bridges. ``I love the character of Maximum Bob. He's outrageous and
awful, but he's also disarming and fun,'' Vassey says. ``My
character's job is to disagree with him, to fight him, but at the
same time, I'm playing with him. I tell people it's kind of like
being on Howard Stern's show.''
 &HT;    The series is one of the few screen adaptations of Leonard's
works to capture the author's linguistic playfulness. There's a
great gag in the pilot where a good ol' boy struggles with a ransom
note, then finally breaks down and asks his kidnap victim how to
spell `orals.'
 &HT;    What do you mean? the victim asks. ``You know, `Do what I say,
orals I'm gonna put her in the wood shed,''' he responds. Vassey
allows that Leonard's peculiar world view and speech patterns
proved a unique acting challenge.
 &HT;    ``As Barry Sonnenfeld suggests, you have to underplay the crazy
scenes,'' she says. ``But at the same time, the dialogue carries
the story, and there's lots of it. When I first looked at how long
some of my speeches were, I said to myself, boy, I'm going to have
(to) play the dialogue very fast. I can't have viewers falling
asleep while I'm talking.''
 &HT;    Actors are notorious worriers. But Vassey has no reason to
concern herself with audience members nodding off during her most
recent work. For nobody is likely to fall asleep in the middle of
the outrageously funny, go-for-baroque world of ``Maximum Bob.''

<P>
   If you're like most parents, you'll spend an average of $408 per
child on back-to-school stuff this year _ so says an American
Express Retail Survey.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing alone comprises 58 percent of this budget. If you've
got more than one child to shop for, that dollar amount can really
add up. You'll also end up spending money on after-school
activities, lunches and other school-related purchases. But, with a
little creativity, you won't end up broke by Christmas.
 &UR; Clothing &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hitting the mall, organize a clothing exchange.
Usually held at community centers, churches or school gyms, parents
bring unwanted garments and, in return, they get gently used
clothing from other parents. No money exchanges hands, explains
Marjorie Norton, Ph.D., a professor of clothing and textiles at
Virginia Tech University.
</P>
<P>
   When money does exchange hands, it can benefit a good cause.
Cynthia Sutton's daughter, Cydney, now 12, used to attend a Dallas
public school that required uniforms. To help raise funds for the
PTA plus offset the cost of new uniforms, parents would set aside a
day to sell used uniforms. ``A jumper that sold new for $20 would
go for $5,'' recalls Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to stretch your clothing dollar further is to buy
from companies that stand behind their products. Catalogers Lands'
End (800-356-4444) and L.L. Bean (800-221-4221) offer 100 percent
satisfaction guaranteed policies. ``If at any time a customer is
not satisfied with a product, she can return it for a full refund
or an exchange,'' says Jolene McGowan, an L.L. Bean spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   Backpack maker Jansport (800-346-8239) offers a full, lifetime
warranty, which Kathy Schriefer of Erie, Pa., took advantage of
last year after the zipper broke on daughter Jen's, 18, backpack.
``We sent it back and received a brand new backpack,'' Schriefer
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Sears has a similar warranty through its Kidvantage program.
``If a kid splits, rips or wears out his clothing before he grows
out of it,'' says Kathleen Connolly, a Sears spokesperson, ``we'll
replace the same item in the same size.'' Sue McCloughan of
Plymouth, Minn., has been taking advantage of the Kidvantage
guarantee since 1994. ``I've received replacements about three
times,'' says McCloughan, mom to Kaitlin, 14 and Quinn, 12.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Sears stand behind the clothing it sells, but it
rewards its customers, too. Parents who register with Kidvantage,
like McCloughan, get 15 percent off every time they spend $100 on
kid's clothing.
 &UR; After-School Activities &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting your kids involved in the extracurricular activities can
be an enriching, albeit expensive, endeavor. But they don't have to
put you in the poorhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spending $1,000 on a new saxophone when son Sam, 12,
joined the junior high school band, Anne Tomlinson of Nukilteo,
Wash., bought a refurbished saxophone for $400 from Music Go Round
(800-645-7299), which sells first-quality, used musical
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   You can find savings on used sports equipment at stores like
Play It Again Sports (800-645-7299), which has 710 U.S. locations.
Instead of paying $99 for a pair of new ice hockey skates, you can
get a comparable secondhand pair for about $30, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be shy about asking relatives, coworkers and friends if
they have a flute stashed away in the attic or a baseball glove
they no longer need, suggests Mary Hunt, publisher of Cheapskate
Monthly ($18 for 12 issues, 800-550-3502). Or talk to your child's
coach or band leader about families he may know of who would be
willing to loan or sell you their used equipment.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not comfortable buying used sporting goods, try to
shop in a sporting superstore like Jumbo Sports (888-207-2965)
where they'll give you 5 percent off if you find cheaper prices
elsewhere.
 &UR; Grooming &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A back-to-school haircut can be had for a song, if you visit a
local beauty school. For example, cosmetology students at Pivot
Point in Chicago, under the supervision of their teachers, of
course, will cut hair for $5. Likewise, Empire Beauty Schools, with
20 locations in Pennsylvania, charge $7. (Regular salons charge
about $15 for a kid's cut.) Look in the Yellow Pages under beauty
schools.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd prefer to visit a bona fide salon, Vidal Sassoon salons
in nine U.S. cities give children under 12 a 30-percent discount.
In addition, one night a week, the salons will charge $15 for a
haircut if you're willing to let haircutters-in-training trim your
locks.
</P>
<P>
   Another option: invest in a pair of good scissors (about $8),
rent a video on haircutting from the library and learn to cut your
kid's hair, says Hunt, who trims her boys' locks herself. Or ask
your regular haircutter if she'll trim your kid's bangs for free or
a nominal fee (most charge $5), or let you barter services for a
free cut. ``You can sweep the salon or run errands while shes
cutting your kid's hair,'' suggests Hunt.
 &UR; Lunch &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kids can eat you out of house and home, but their school lunches
don't have to. See if your school district will let you buy hot
lunches in advance at a discount, like Judy Kessler of Van Nuys,
Calif., did for son Steven, 14. She spent $100 up front for 100
lunches and saved $75. Or, investigate whether or not your family
may be eligible for free or reduced-cost lunches; you don't have to
be poor to qualify. According to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, which oversees the National School Lunch Program,
children from families of four earning up to $28,860 can buy lunch
for 40 cents each day.
</P>
<P>
   Another money-saver: don't use commercially prepared juice
boxes. Tracey McBride, author of Frugal Luxuries (Bantam, 1997),
estimates that every time you throw away a juice box, you're losing
20 cents. Instead, follow the lead of Denver mom Pam Lendi. She
invested in Rubbermaid juice boxes for about $1.30 each, refills
them each day and saves about $95 a year. Cheapskate extraordinaire
Hunt goes one step further by washing and reusing 20-ounce soda
bottles as drink containers.
</P>
<P>
   If you are truly brand conscious, call each company whose
product you use and ask for money-saving coupons. ``Almost every
brand lists a toll-free number on its label,'' says Hunt. ``I've
gotten 75-cent and $1-coupons, and the best part is, they have no
expiration date.''
 &UR; Computers &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to save money on computer costs, if all your
child needs is a word processor. Stores like Kinko's (800-2-KINKOS)
rent computers by the hour _ an Ann Arbor, Mich., location lets you
use a PC or a Mac for $12 an hour. Or see if your local library has
computers for the public to use. ``It's not nearly as convenient as
having a computer at home,'' says Hunt, ``but it sure is cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to buy your child a computer this year, check out
used equipment at Computer Renaissance (800-645-7299) or mail-order
company Rumarson Technology (800-929-0029) in Kenilworth, N.J..
Recently, Rumarson was offering a Pentium chip computer, monitor
and printer for $1,000; it would cost $1,800 at retail. Both
companies offer warranties on all computers they sell.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the computer you buy comes pre-loaded with software.
Rumarson's computers have about $200 worth of programs on them
already. However, if you must buy software yourself _ and you
already have Internet access _ check out shareware Web sites, from
which you can download software for a nominal fee (about $30)
instead of paying close to $100 at retail.
 &UR; Health Checkups &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If your kids are due for vaccinations, call the National
Immunization Information Hotline, operated by the American Social
Health Association under contract with the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, at 800-232-2522, to find local doctors and
clinics offering free or low-cost immunizations. If you haven't
been keeping up with your well-child visits and want your son or
daughter to have a back-to-school checkup, see if your local church
or synagogue participates in a program like the one Egleston's
Children's Health Care System offers with 45 houses of worship in
Atlanta, Ga. Together, they put parishioners in touch with low-cost
medical services available in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Your regular pediatrician may have hidden savings. Ask if you
can get a discount for paying in cash. It's one of Hunt's favorite
money saving tips. ``I've been able to get as much as 25 percent
off,'' she says. Another of her favorites: If you child needs
prescription medication, buy it through a mail-order pharmacy.
``You can save up to 50 percent over the pharmacy down the
street,'' she says
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ask family and friends if they know of any local
doctors who offer bargains or cash-saving incentives. Optometrist
Danna Haba gives free back-to-school vision screenings to
schoolchildren at her Utica, Mich., office _ a $60 savings off her
regular fee. Framingham, Mass., dentist Tom Orent rewards patients
with a $20 credit and a $20 gift certificate to a local restaurant
if they send their friends to his office. Their friends, in return,
get $50 off an initial exam.

<P>
   Hospitalized for a week after going into premature labor, Mary
Searcy was sent home with strict orders from her doctor to remain
in bed.
</P>
<P>
   Her bed rest lasted for more than a month. Then, eight weeks
before her due date, she delivered her first child, David.
</P>
<P>
   Although Searcy, then 24, had been told to expect a premature
birth, no one counseled her about the special problems of caring
for a newborn preemie. When David came home after four weeks in the
hospital, he had difficulty swallowing and his heartbeat was
erratic. ``My husband and I were in a state of shock,'' Searcy
recalls. ``We were never told where to turn for support.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for information, Searcy combed her local bookstores in
Wyoming, Mich., but had only limited success. In frustration, she
decided to try the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   She borrowed a modem for her computer, went online, and posted
requests for help on every baby and childbirth-related bulletin
board she could find. Eventually, she located a group of moms and
dads who had recently formed an online community, called Preemie-L
(home.vicnet.net.au/(TILDE)garyh/preemie.htm), for sharing their
feelings and experiences as parents of preemies via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``like a family,'' Searcy says, ``a place where I met
others who knew what I was going through.'' From finding tiny
clothing that accommodated monitor leads to determining whether
David's speech delay was typical of preemies, Searcy got answers on
the Web. That was a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Preemie-L now features a discussion forum, the latest research
from neonatologists and psychologists, and an archive of resources
on bed rest and preemie care compiled by Searcy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Home on the Web &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Far from finding cyberspace cold and impersonal, Searcy
discovered a gathering place where she could get help and, later,
give something back to the community that had sustained her. And
the bonds grew over the years. At a conference held in Detroit this
summer, she met the Australian founder of Preemie-L for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   Searcy's experience is not unique. More and more women are going
online and discovering the value of Internet access. According to a
1997 survey by Nielsen Media Research/CommerceNet, women make up 42
percent of adult users of the Internet, up from 34 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies indicate that anywhere from one-third to one-half
of Internet users live in households with children.
</P>
<P>
   Internet interconnections are myriad. Type the word parenting or
motherhood in any of numerous search engines (services such as
Yahoo! and Excite that sort Internet sites) and well over 10,000
hits, or entries, will appear.
</P>
<P>
   Moms turn to the Internet to stay in touch with family and
friends, to do research and browse for information, to tap into
special online forums of parents sharing similar interests, and to
shop.
</P>
<P>
   They compare notes on recognizing and treating childhood
diseases. One woman checks out the Northern California section of
``Moms Across America'' on the Moms On-Line Web site to see if
anyone has posted what children's software is on the shelves at the
local discount warehouse store. (That site is reachable via America
Online.) She also downloads coloring pages for her daughter and
sits with her son in her lap reading him a new Elmo story from the
PBS Web site. (www.pbs.org)
</P>
<P>
   One clear benefit of Internet connections, online moms say, is
that they help reduce the sense of social isolation that new
mothers can feel.
</P>
<P>
   When Nancy Brown, 37, of Martinez, Calif., was looking for a
play group, for her 1-year-old son, Evan, she started her search at
the computer, logging on to a mothers' forum on AOL. A woman living
nearby replied with details about a mothers club. Brown's query led
to some members forming a play group that has been meeting once a
week in local parks for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   In between their weekly encounters, the six moms in the play
group stay in touch via e-mail. ``We get a chance to finish up
those snatches of conversation that we had attempted at the park
while chasing after a little one,'' Brown comments.
</P>
<P>
   Going farther afield than area parks, a group of moms-to-be
spanned four continents to form close e-mail friendships when they
subscribed to an Internet mailing list for women with April 1996
due dates. Now, members of the April '96 Moms say their common
experiences run far beyond pregnancy. They've shared in everything
from the births of their children, their toddlers' first steps, and
the arrival of siblings to heated online debates over natural birth
and pacifiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assumed the group would slowly dissolve, but our friendships
are stronger than ever,'' says Paige Schreiner, 31, of
Gaithersburg, Md., one of the club's 60-odd active members.
</P>
<P>
   Every month, new delivery-date groups are formed. Women
expecting babies in September can find a September 1998 Club by
checking out the news group misc.kids.pregnancy. (News groups are
forums on the Internet that are sorted by subject.)
</P>
<P>
   A world of cyber communities has formed around an almost
infinite number of topics from autism to childhood diabetes, from
home schooling to the Special Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   One e-mail group, CyberMommies, was created as a forum on
infertility and adoption. Karen Ledbetter, 42, of Mooresville,
N.C., tells of at least one fellow CyberMommy who adopted a baby as
the result of leads from the group. Ledbetter also cites coping
strategies the women share: ``We help each other deal with the rude
remarks people can sometimes make about adoption.''
</P>
<P>
   For many moms, the Internet has become as indispensable as the
phone. It's the Information Age's pen pal, armchair adviser, and
door-to-door salesman. As Searcy notes, her most important
discovery on the Web was that ``I wasn't alone.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever notice how the more you try to get done, the more you seem
to have in front of you? You try so hard to find ways to save
time-but where does it go?
</P>
<P>
   More likely than not, it gets packed with more things to do,
places to go, people to call, decisions to make. You pick up fast
food for the kids so you'll have a few minutes to yourself after
dinner. But instead of reading that new novel, you find yourself
trying to get a jump on tomorrow's work or getting sucked into
making some PTA telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Slow down! There's a way to get it all done without driving
yourself nuts. The truth is, all the timesaving tips and gadgets
can't help if you haven't learned to relax, to approach the world
and your life more peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is there is a way to not only feel better about
yourself but also to actually get everything done. The solution has
to do with changing your thoughts and feelings. A new attitude will
help you focus and prioritize. Because you'll be less distracted,
you'll conserve energy and minimize mistakes. Most important,
changing your mind-set will reduce any frenzied feelings you have,
because even though you'll have just as much to do, you'll feel
like you have plenty of time.
</P>
<P>
   First, a look at the ways your mind does and doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to know you have two distinct modes of thought.
The first is analytical: your brain resembles a computer, storing
and processing, evaluating data and planning. The second is free
flow, when your mind operates like a river, always moving, bringing
you just the right ideas for the moment. Thoughts come to you
effortlessly, out of the blue. This mode kicks in when your mind is
relaxed instead of engaged.
</P>
<P>
   There's a time and a place for each way _ neither is better. The
analytical mode is suited for balancing your checkbook, calculating
time or planning a schedule. It's also useful when you're making a
list, figuring out the best way to get to an unfamiliar location or
doing something for the first time. You want to be in this mode
when you need to figure something out.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, most people spend too much time being
analytical. Trying to figure everything out is the biggest reason
you feel hurried and harried. Thinking leads to feelings. If you're
harboring angry thoughts, you're going to feel angry. Similarly,
cynicism breeds suspicion, and feeding yourself hurried messages
brings on the sense of being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a really busy schedule, for example, thoughts like
``How am I ever going to get it all done'' or simply going over and
over your schedule, even talking about it with others, can stir up
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   During these times, rather than being focused and calm, your
mind is all over the place, leaving you barely able to concentrate
on the one thing you're actually doing _ getting dressed, driving,
preparing a meal, cleaning a room or performing some other task.
</P>
<P>
   Give your head a break, and get your life back.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the best thing you can do when you're feeling rushed
is to clear your mind. You need to drop the racing thoughts, which
allows you to enter the free-flowing mode. When your brain is
clear, the door to inspiration and wisdom is opened. Because
there's less going on mentally, solutions that seemed impossible to
find will come to you as if out of left field.
</P>
<P>
   Ever have the experience of struggling to remember a name or a
fact, only to have it magically pop into your head only after you
gave up pushing for it? Ever wonder why your best ideas occur to
you not when you're straining for them but while you're taking a
shower or listening to some music ? That's the strength of the
free-flowing mode.
</P>
<P>
   This power means that whenever you stop analyzing and drop into
free flow thought, your inner wisdom surfaces to help you out of
whatever dilemma you face. Your mind isn't turned off. You're still
thinking but in a more passive way. Just as using the back burner
can be the best way to prepare a meal, the more passive mode is
often the best way to approach your hectic life.
</P>
<P>
   You can learn the easy device of switching between the two modes
by following these steps:
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention to your feelings.
</P>
<P>
   They are the key to knowing you're in the wrong mode. If you
feel stressed out, take a couple of slow, deep breaths and check in
with yourself. Is your internal voice yakking away about how things
are going or what you need to do for the rest of the day? By simply
acknowledging that your mind is too busy, you start slowing it
down.
</P>
<P>
   Admit to yourself you're caught up in your own thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Recognize that you need to become quieter within by saying
something gentle to yourself like ``Whoops, there I go again.''
This admission reinforces the fact that it's your own thinking, not
the outside world, that's making you feel frantic. Sometimes the
simple act of acknowledging you are off track is enough to bring
calm.
</P>
<P>
   Live in the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago I attended a lecture by a famous speaker who spoke
on the issue of being in a hurry. He was a very busy man but a
remarkably calm one. During the question-and-answer period, a
nervous-looking audience member asked, ``You've given lectures in
over 50 cities during the last two months _ and you have a family.
Aren't you exhausted? A schedule like that would make me crazy. How
do you do it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply do one thing at a time,'' the speaker responded in a
voice that calmed the entire audience. ``I remain present. Instead
of looking at my schedule and freaking out that I'll be in one city
today and another tomorrow, I do just what's before me _ one thing
after another.''
</P>
<P>
   Be patient.
</P>
<P>
   Slowing down your mind is simple, but it's not easy: You won't
learn to do it in a day. Plan to put the brakes on racing thoughts
as best you can, as often as you can. It's a practice that pays. If
you keep up your efforts, eventually you'll reap big serenity
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Dare to be mellow.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so you know how to rein in your speedy mind and go into
free-flow mode. What about those all around you who are losing
their heads? Our culture gives us a lot of messages that it's a
good thing to hurry up _ and be completely stressed out. Many of us
brag about how busy, overwhelmed and sleep deprived we are.
</P>
<P>
   It's a badge of honor. It's true that most of us are over
committed. But we don't have to win first place in the
how-close-am-I-to-burnout sweepstakes. While everyone is rushing
around frantically, keep to your own more peaceful pace. It does
take courage. But it's the best thing for you. (Plus, you really do
get more done!)

 &HT;    Voice from beyond greets Dickinson's survivors
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It was a voice she never dreamed she'd hear
again. It came to Judy Dickinson Thursday by overnight mail.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected package had been sent to Dayton by a woman in
Macon, Ga. When the woman's husband had been dying of multiple
sclerosis and could no longer see, Judy's husband _ Gardner
Dickinson _ wanted to do something special. He and the guy had gone
to high school together in the early 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Gardner _ one of the pioneers of the PGA Tour and Senior
PGA Tour, as well as one of the best golf instructors the game has
ever known _ decided to read the golf book he had written, as well
as special notes and asides, into a tape recorder. He sent the
labor of love _10 cassettes in all _ to his dying friend.
</P>
<P>
   Now the guy's widow thought Judy might like to have the tapes
back. Gardner had died April 19th after years of heart problems. He
was 70.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the 48-year-old Judy _ who had taken golf lessons
from Gardner for years before marrying him in 1985 _ has struggled
not only with her grief, but with everyday life as she tried
competing on the LPGA Tour, while also raising the couple's
eight-year-old twin sons, Barron and Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   This season _ her 21st year on the women's pro circuit _ she has
tried to play in only nine of the first 25 tour stops. In four of
those outings, she has missed the cut. Her best finish is a tie for
24th and she's made just $14,156.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard, it still is,'' she said. ``People come up to
me along the way and tell me how they lost a husband or a wife.
Most everyone says it takes at least two years until you feel
you're not just going through the motions. You don't realize the
void that's there. I think of Gardner all the time. I can't tell
you how many times I go to call him and then it hits me. No one is
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Then last Friday morning, he was.
</P>
<P>
   As she and the boys were driving from the place where they're
staying near the Dayton Mall to the first round of the Star Bank
LPGA Classic at the Country Club of the North, Judy took out the
packet of tapes and shoved one in the tape deck.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly Gardner's voice filled the vehicle. He was telling a
story about Sam Snead. After that came a tale about Bobby Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys were kind of shocked,'' she said. ``They hadn't heard
his voice in a long time. He had had his first triple by-pass a
year after they were born and the strokes and other problems never
let them really know their dad as he was. Toward the end, Gardner
hadn't been able to talk at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more they listened, the more it amazed them. They asked,
'Is that daddy? Is it really daddy?' I told them it sure was. For
me, it was great to hear his voice. I think it inspired me.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing her best golf of the past four seasons, Dickinson fired
a six-under-par 66 to finish the Star Bank's opening round tied for
third, four strokes off Dottie Pepper's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all came together,'' Dickinson said. ``I think Gardner
helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Gardner had always been able to coax the best golf out
of her. That goes back to the days when she was Judy Clark, a girl
raised in Akron and schooled at Glassboro State before becoming a
top New Jersey amateur.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner _ called the Slim Man because of his 5-foot-10,
130-pound build _ had always been bigger than life. After turning
pro in 1952, he was a sidekick of Ben Hogan and later influenced
golfers like Jack Nicklaus and JoAnne Carner.
</P>
<P>
   He was an opinionated guy who stuck to his guns. In describing
their differences, Judy once explained: ``I'm pretty much on the
left and he's on the right...of John Birch.'' Friday, she quietly
laughed at his ways:
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually that's part of what attracted me. He liked to have a
good time, but he let you know exactly where he stood. A lot of
people won't speak up. Instead they talk behind your back. He was
straight-forward.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years after they married they decided to have children.
``Truthfully, I was scared to death. I'd never baby sat much and I
didn't know how I'd be with children. Gardner (who had three
children by a previous marriage) said it's different when they're
your own kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``And my clock was ticking. I was 39 and he was getting older,
too. But it turned out it was the best thing that ever happened to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   As the LPGA president for three years, she made it better for
other touring mothers as well. She was instrumental in creating the
regular travelling day-care program on the tour. Now she's thinking
about getting a junior golf program for tour youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Her kids have been travelling with her since June. ``The weeks I
didn't take them were the toughest,'' she said. ``Now we haven't
been back to our house (near West Palm Beach, Fla.) for a couple of
months. It's been good to get away from the memories, but Monday we
head back. Just as I'm playing better, it's time for the kids to go
back to school. I'll only play another tournament or two this year,
then it's back being a regular mom.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice and pro-am rounds last week, Barron did some
caddying for his mom and afterwards surmised that he wants to be a
player, not a caddy because he thinks the pros have the better end
of the deal. Although his mom did pay him, he returned the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loaned them $300 to buy a golden retriever, so he said,
'Here Mom, this is to start paying off Rosie.''' The rest of the
week, the boys have gone bowling, visited the Air Force Museum and
done some swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're beginning to ask more and more about their dad,'' she
said. ``I just want them to know how much he loved them.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years after the boys were born, Gardner talked to a
USA Today reporter about having children late in his life. ``I
won't live to see them grown,'' he said. ``I guess that isn't fair
to them, but at least I'll leave part of me behind.''
</P>
<P>
   That he has.
</P>
<P>
   And this morning on the way to the golf course, Judy and the
boys plan to listen to him once again.

 &HT;    Now, trade looks good to Brown
 &HT;    By Dan Graziano
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Kevin Brown didn't like it at first. Not one bit.
</P>
<P>
   It was December 15, and the Florida Marlins had just traded
Brown to the San Diego Padres for three minor-league prospects. And
the prospect of moving almost a continent away from his Macon, Ga.,
home, his wife and two sons was pretty unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's eight months later, the Padres are sitting atop the
National League West, the Marlins are languishing in last, and
Brown himself his the proud owner of a 14-3 record and an 11-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a lot better than I probably could have hoped for,''
Brown said Friday, before his new team took on his old team at
Qualcomm Stadium. ``I knew it was going to be difficult for the
family, that was the main thing. But when the team does this well,
it's easy to put the past in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The past includes last year's 16-8 campaign, which of course
culminated in the Marlins' World Series championship. It also
includes the 17-11 season Brown had in 1996. Remember that one?
That was the year Brown had a major-league-best 1.89 ERA and walked
just 33 batters all season, yet couldn't seem to win because the
Marlins couldn't seem to score runs for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably threw the ball better that year,'' Brown said.
``But you can throw the ball well and not get the results. It's
definitely headed back in the other direction now. I could go for
about seven or eight years of it heading in the other direction.
That'd be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Padres, who began Friday's game just two games behind
the Braves for the National League's best record, are thinking
about this year only. That's why they gave up well-regarded
prospects like Derrek Lee and Rafael Medina for Brown, even though
he can be a free agent at the end of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great guy to have, because he's a horse, basically,''
Padres right fielder Tony Gwynn said. ``You can't have too many
guys like that. When he's on the mound, we feel like nobody can
beat us, and you can't put a price on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn also made the point that Brown's mere presence has helped
the rest of the pitching staff. Andy Ashby, who started Friday's
game, was 15-6 with a 2.55 ERA. A pair of aces like that makes
Sterling Hitchcock, Joey Hamilton and Mark Langston the No. 3, 4
and 5 starters, and that makes for a pretty good starting staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a guy like Brownie, that takes a lot of pressure off
the staff,'' Marlins manager Jim Leyland said. ``It takes a lot of
pressure off the manager, too, because you know you're going to get
seven innings from a guy like that every time you run him out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His attitude is just right,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy said.
``He's out there, he won't accept losing. He has a hard time
accepting that he made one bad pitch. For other guys to see that,
it makes a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is enjoying being back in a pennant race, but he's not
looking forward too much, mainly because he doesn't have much time
left this season to spend with his family. Candace, Ridge and
Grayson will be moving back to Georgia in the coming weeks, as
seven-year-old Ridge is getting ready to go back to school.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Ridge was in heaven. He was in the Padres' clubhouse,
wearing a jersey with his dad's name and number on the back, trying
to escape dental-floss-wielding Padres first baseman Wally Joyner,
who wanted to remove one of Ridge's very loose teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge's glove, bought for him by his mother, had inscribed on it
the name of Chipper Jones, third baseman for hated rival Atlanta.
When this was pointed out to father and son, they both decided that
should change. They got a black magic marker and scribbled it out,
with Kevin promising to find some back shoe polish later with which
to finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   Winning ballgames, being in first place, goofing off with his
seven-year-old son. Yep, Kevin Brown was right. This has all worked
out pretty well.

 &HT;    No Marlins? No matter _ game still exciting
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   All right, so it's football season again and you're ready to
drop baseball like a bad habit.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem with our remote-control generation, so eager
to surf from one hot topic to the next. Did the Marlins really win
the World Series, for instance, or was that all just a really slick
infomercial for some fast-acting antacid?
</P>
<P>
   Easy to get it all confused sometimes. Easy to forget that in
America, two things can and must endure : Elvis and baseball.
</P>
<P>
   I offer to frustrated South Florida fans a reminder that the
baseball season still runs through October. Playoffs included.
Marlins excluded. Like it or not. I offer, also, the suggestion
that there is a great deal to like about that, and a significant
amount to love.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey, Jr.,
each slowing in their chase for Roger Maris' epic single-season
record of 61 home runs. Which will burst from the pack this month
and make a true run at the thing is fascinating conjecture. My
opinion has shifted significantly of late, from a Big Mac certainty
to a Sammy surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is the only one whose team still has a reason to play. That
will help keep his mind occupied with driving in run and winning
big games for Chicago. The home runs tend to come more naturally,
more easily, that way.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, should the Cubs continue their challenge for a
wild-card playoff spot, or even the NL Central title, Sosa's
home-run spectacle will be absorbed to some degree by the drama of
a haunted and beloved franchise inching once more toward the cruel
unknown. Not even the Bulls have ever gripped Chicago like a Cubs
World Series would.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another baseball question tough enough to chew upon until
September is spent. Which team is going to do what Florida did a
year ago, beating out Atlanta for the National League pennant?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it may seem ridiculous to count out an Atlanta team whose
regal pitching staff leads the majors with 15 shutouts, including
consecutive three-hitters by Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins eliminated the Braves in 1997 with a rotation that
lacked Alex Fernandez and featured Livan Hernandez, a rookie. San
Diego and Houston, leaders of their respective divisions, can do it
again, and not just because they inherited from Florida a pair of
noted Braves-killers (Kevin Brown with the Padres and Moises Alou
with the Astros).
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have solid lineups, in some ways more dangerous than
the Braves. Craig Biggio, the game's best leadoff man, always is on
base for the Astros. Greg Vaughn (39 homers) always is clearing the
bases for the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment I'm leaning toward the Padres as eventual NL
champions because they've got monster closers from either side _
right-hander Trevor Hoffman (37 saves) and lefty Randy Myers
(30-save seasons with five different teams). There is one enormous
reason to hold out for Houston, however, a 6-foot-10 equalizer
named Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   An Astros regular-season home record crowd of 52,071 watched the
Big Unit shut out the Phillies Friday. Most of those fans were in
the building in time to watch Johnson go through his pre-game wa-kp
in the bullpen. Baseball is booming in Houston, a city that doesn't
even have an NFL franchise and doesn't miss the one that got away.
</P>
<P>
   Whew, that's a lot of baseball talk without even mentioning the
Yankees, everybody's solid World Series favorite. Edge a little
closer to the television. Bore a little deeper into the box scores.
There is no need to retreat, no matter what course the Marlins
choose.
</P>
<P>
   As long as it's baseball, every citizen retains a legitimate
stake.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Golfer regains stride, plays for fun again
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ She hit ``rock bottom,'' as she calls it, in
October of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Noble had lost her playing card after a promising start on
the LPGA Tour, was back at Qualifying School, it was Day One, and
she was in the process of shooting 81.
</P>
<P>
   On the back nine, tears came to her eyes and started tracing
down her cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Near a breakdown?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Totally,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Golf can do that to you; can grab you like a bouncer and start
tossing you around until you're bruised in both body and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Noble was to that point and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   A three-time New Jersey State Women's amateur champion, she had
done well at Wake Forest, qualified in her first try for the LPGA
and finished 49th on the money list her rookie year. She tied for
second in her first LPGA Championship and was a star waiting to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime between the end of that magical 1992 season and the
start of 1993, Karen Noble lost her confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, I don't know,'' she said. ``But I played awful. And then
I started trying to fix my swing. I should have taken time off to
work on my brain because out here you face failure every week. I
really did a lot of damage to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad play fed on itself. It's a vicious circle: The worse you
play, the worse you feel, the worse you play. So 1993 bled into '94
. . . '95 . . . '96 and her game was in tatters and she finally
lost her card.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, everyone tried to help. Family, friends, fellow
players, the milkman. ``Everyone has solutions,'' she said.
``You're struggling. You're searching. You listen. You're
confused.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, you lose your card, and you're at qualifying school
shooting 81 and you're crying and if someone came up and offered to
buy your clubs for $5 and a bus ticket to Memphis, you'd probably
take it.
</P>
<P>
   We were sitting upstairs in the clubhouse at Country Club of the
North last Friday, and Karen Noble wasn't crying anymore. She'd
just shot a 4-under-par 68 at the Star Bank LPGA Classic, finishing
before the blast furnace heat gripped the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back to just trying to have fun,'' she said. ``It
sounds silly, but I tried to just start enjoying myself again,''
she said. ``I try to avoid thinking of the outcome and think only
of the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds so simple, yet sometimes it's the only way out of
golf's cave. You go back to when you were a kid and dad dropped you
off at the course every morning and golf was fun and life was a
lark.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago at the Friendly's Classic in Massachusetts, Noble
tied for 11th. Hit 18 greens the final day, shot 2-under 70 and
made $10,340. It was her first five-figure check since her rookie
year. ``It looked like a million,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   More important, her confidence never waned. All day, shot after
shot, she held together as if made of steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge step,'' she called it.
</P>
<P>
   She is blue eyed and blonde and has a Hollywood look _ like a
young Kelly McGillis.
</P>
<P>
   She'll turn 31 in 15 days. And she likes what she's doing again.
Loves coming to the course. Loves the whole scene.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time in the depths of her struggles when they called
her Karen CherNoble after the Russian nuclear plant. ``Terrible
temper, terrible attitude,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to that Karen?
</P>
<P>
   ``I killed her,'' Karen Noble said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week she went home to New Jersey and saw her Golden
Retriever, Baron, slept in her own bed, and came here refreshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to enjoy myself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.

 &HT;    Superstar endorsers starting to fade
 &HT;    By Ethan J. Skolnick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The idea of letting Mark McGwire walk
isn't a new one. McGwire was issued his first intentional pass of
1998 even before the baseball season began _ by Reebok. As you
might expect with a company that created a shoe called The Answer,
Reebok has one when it's asked the inevitable question:
</P>
<P>
   What were you thinking?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was looking for an ad about him,'' said Dave Fogelson,
Reebok spokesman, of the man chasing Roger Maris' home run record.
``We want to start talking about the product. For years, we have
had ads about the athlete, and by association, the brand. We can't
have that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the shift in focus? Because the athletic-shoe business is
running in place, and many companies are starting to view superstar
endorsers _ with their super-expensive contracts _ as part of the
problem, not the solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a certain amount of burnout with the athlete
endorser concept,'' said John Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods
Intelligence, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Nike reported its first monthly loss in 13 years.
Reebok reported a 12.2 percent drop in shoe sales and a $3.4
million loss in the year's first quarter; Fila's parent company
reported an $8.7 million loss. Converse reported sales of its
basketball line fell 50 percent during that same period.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this decline is attributable to a change in public
taste. More young consumers are choosing street shoes, made by such
companies as Doc Maartens or Timberland, or ``extreme sports''
nontraditional footwear. Yet, it is notable that one of the few
growing companies in the industry is New Balance, which has long
abided by the slogan, ``Endorsed By No One.''
</P>
<P>
   So what becomes of the athletic someones? Many get cut.
</P>
<P>
   Converse has dumped controversial or high-priced NBA endorsers
such as Latrell Sprewell and Larry Johnson in favor of
lesser-known, lower-risk guys such as Bobby Jackson and Brevin
Knight. Pennsylvania-based athletic-shoe company And 1 ditched its
biggest-name endorser, Stephon Marbury. Fila parted ways with New
York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter because the company, according
to director of advertising Mark Westerman, ``decided baseball was
not going to be a focus group for us.'' Not long ago, the shoe
company would have based its products on its athletes, not the
other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok has made drastic cutbacks in its baseball and NFL ranks,
dropping such stars as Larry Walker and Emmitt Smith. It also has
sliced its NBA roster to about one-third of its high of 100-plus.
In June, it decided that Shaquille O'Neal was not worth his $3
million annual fee, and let him go.
</P>
<P>
   Think of O'Neal as the Dow Industrials Average, the most
high-profile signifier of a correction that had been taking place
in this market for some time. Now, says Westerman, ``it's a buyers'
market,'' in favor of the company buying the athletes' services.
</P>
<P>
   That's a major switch. Since the mid-1980s, shoe companies have
tried to replicate the success Nike had in promoting Michael Jordan
and his signature products. For Reebok, primarily a women's fitness
brand, and Fila, primarily a tennis brand, signing team-sport stars
was a way of creating a new image. Reebok, in particular, began
competing with Nike for baseball, NBA and NFL players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus was on which athlete was wearing what brand, as
opposed to what the product was really about,'' Fogelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoe companies went for the blanket effect, signing
endorsement deals with second- or third-tier players,'' said Sean
Brenner, editor of the Team Marketing Report, another industry
newsletter. ``It became difficult for consumers to differentiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Fogelson remembers watching an NBA game on TNT. Commercial
break. Jordan and Penny Hardaway endorsing Nike. Kobe Bryant,
adidas. Grant Hill, Fila. Allen Iverson, Reebok. ``This is nuts,''
he thought.
</P>
<P>
   Oversaturation hasn't been the only bugaboo. The more athletes
endorsing, the more risk for off-the-field travails and negative
associations. Now industry insiders believe that companies, if they
sign suspect individuals, will avoid long-term, guaranteed
contracts. Most new contracts give advertisers sole discretion to
terminate, if an athlete's actions disparage the company.
</P>
<P>
   Converse let Sprewell go after he choked his coach. Yet Reebok
has stood by Iverson, who has had various legal problems. The
company has even designed three Iverson shoes: The Question, The
Answer and The Answer II. The Answer wasn't quite as successful as
the Question, and Fogelson attributes that to design problems, not
image problems. ``The marketplace loves the authenticity Allen
represents,'' Fogelson argued.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, the marketplace likes a quality product.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a product is not good, I don't think any personality can
carry it,'' said Gregg Hartley, vice president of marketing for the
Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Proper marketing is a necessity, too, no matter how well known
the athlete-endorser is. Nike's Tiger Woods line of golf clothes
and shoes has fallen far short of expectations. Retailers have
complained that the products, especially the radical Air Zoom TW,
which retails for some $225, missed their market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tiger Woods marketing approach works real well for kids,
but kids can't afford pricing they are charging for them,'' Horan
said. ``Only so many kids can talk dads into buying those.''
</P>
<P>
   And only so many kids are playing golf. So the success of the
Woods products depended on an older, more conservative demographic.
Lee Weinstein, a Nike spokesman, says it was ``an OK launch. You
always learn a few lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies have learned another lesson. ``Jordan was a
phenomenon,'' Hartley said. ``There are very few people who can
drive a product through in the market the way Jordan has.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nike intends to keep trying. The company which now
provides McGwire's cleats isn't changing course. ``The very
foundation of Nike is built on working with athletes,'' Weinstein
says of a company that first worked with runner Steve Prefontaine
in 1972. ``Some of our competitors may be fickle, but we certainly
are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Reebok wanted to focus more on its DMX technology, and Fogelson
claims ``we are getting more feedback from that advertising than we
did from any other.'' Meanwhile, Nike is getting the fallout _ more
calls than ever from athletes' representatives, and less need to
bid the price up.
</P>
<P>
   Nike has the three players who are chasing the home run record,
which could help McGwire, Sammy Sosa or Ken Griffey Jr. transcend
his sport in a way Jordan, Woods, Greg Norman and very few baseball
players (maybe Cal Ripken Jr.) have. Weinstein said Nike has yet to
work up a ``home run'' ad, but may in the future.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, says Nova Lanktree of Sports Celebrity Network, could
be the perfect pitchman: ``Handsome, healthy, athletic, and about
to make history.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fogelson says Reebok isn't regretful. He notes that when
Reebok-sponsored Northwestern won the Rose Bowl, ``a very
significant achievement, we celebrated with an ad. Did it help us
sell shoes? We're not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   He is among industry insiders who expect more athletes to
endorse because the shoe fits them, not because they fit the shoe
company. ``Where we get chosen, because they really like our
product,'' Fogelson said.
</P>
<P>
   A short time back, that seemed as unlikely as hitting 62 homers.

 &HT;    BUSINESS COMMENTARY: A legacy besides rock 'n' roll?
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Many people are so busy paying the bills they scarcely
notice how much wealth they are building up. At the end of each
month, their house may seem more like a money pit than an
appreciating asset. But time will change that for most.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the kids will move away, the mortgage will get paid
off and deceased parents will leave behind an inheritance. That
patrimony may be considerable: Economists estimate $12 trillion is
now in the hands of the fading World War II generation whose heirs
are the 76 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964.
</P>
<P>
   When those boomers themselves start dying off in significant
numbers _ around 2020 _ their estates will be up for grabs. While
many of today's workers are not saving enough money to generate
adequate cash in retirement, most are investing in assets, such as
homes and furnishings, that will be worth a great deal after they
die.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the baby boomers someday will have tens of
trillions of dollars to bequeath to others.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen with all that money? Will it get squandered by
spoiled heirs or put to good purposes? If it is spent well, the
aggregate wealth of the post-war generation could have a huge
impact on American life in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a big if.
</P>
<P>
   Unless more people start planning now, this immense fortune
could get wasted. Ron Chernow, author of ``Titan,'' a new biography
of John D. Rockefeller Sr., says dispensing money wisely is a
tougher job than most people realize.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller, the nation's richest man at the start of the
century, ``spent as much time giving away money as making it,''
Chernow said during a recent book tour in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire vastly improved life for millions by using his
money to spur the growth of libraries, universities and medical
institutions. Rockefeller's fortune had an enormous impact because
he spent decades teaching himself how to be an effective
benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   Many people assume that ``late in life, to atone for his sins,
Rockefeller suddenly turned to philanthropy,'' Chernow said. In
fact, he consistently gave money to his church starting from
childhood. His charitable work grew along with his wealth. By his
early 40s, he was no longer funding just Baptist activities but was
putting up the money for imaginative projects. For example, at age
43, he funded the creation of Atlanta's Spelman College so the
daughters of former slaves could be turned into schoolteachers.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Rockefeller retired, he was a world-class
philanthropist who knew that ``it takes work and it takes time to
give away money,'' Chernow said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, baby boomers are still focused on earning money and
aren't inclined to think about their own mortality. Drawing up a
will is no one's idea of fun. But time is passing. With the recent
deaths of so many boomer icons _ including ``Buffalo Bob'' and Roy
Rogers _ it's getting harder to pretend the post-war generation can
stay forever young. By getting involved with charities now, boomers
can begin learning how to leave some legacy besides rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always gigantic needs to be filled,'' Chernow said.
``It's a matter of having the creativity to give away money'' in
ways that go to the roots of society's problems, as Rockefeller did
when he funded libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always surprises me that no one has tried to open programs
to provide drug treatment'' to large numbers of poor people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the generation that introduced widespread drug use to
American culture could use some of its assets to help undo that
great harm in the next century.

 &HT;    How to survive on volatile Wall Street
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mutual fund executive James P. O'Shaughnessy asked a
client a few days back if he was ``nervous about the crash of
1987.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was 11 years ago. Why should I be nervous about it?'' the
puzzled client asked.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was the point, O'Shaughnessy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleven years from now, will you care about what happened in
August of 1998?'' he asked. ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   The way for investors to get through the kind of stock market
we've had in the last month is to know why they're investing and to
have enough self-discipline to stay the course, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What usually happens is that the market goes down heavily and
then everyone bails out. To me, the greatest risk is that people
will focus on short-term volatility and take their eye off the
ball,'' said O'Shaughnessy, manager of the O'Shaughnessy Funds in
Greenwich, Conn., and author of ``What Works on Wall Street'' and
other investment books.
</P>
<P>
   Bailing out is especially tempting to relative newcomers to the
market, especially when stock averages fall as much as 3.4 percent
in one day, as the Dow Jones industrial average did Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the weekend arrived with some relief as investors followed
up the week's early declines by buying, helping the market recoup
some of its loss. Even so, the Dow lost 285.27 points for the five
days.
</P>
<P>
   It was a repeat, on a much smaller scale, of when the Dow
plunged 554 points last Oct. 27 _ its worst one-day point loss ever
_ only to rally by 30 percent over the next nine months to an
all-time high of 9,337.97 on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if the market will take a similar course
over the next nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The October sell-off was triggered by the spread of Asia's
economic crisis, which threatened the profits of U.S. corporations.
Investors worred that Asia would curtail its buying of U.S. goods
and undercut American business by exporting cheaper products to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts believe the threat became a reality in the first
half of 1998 _ especially in the second quarter _ and the resulting
decline in profit growth precipitated the latest selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recognition of earnings growth this year lower than 4 percent,
and continued downward earnings revisions for next year, are
finally spreading through the marketplace,'' said strategist Rao
Chalasani of Chicago-based Everen Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The bearish argument that stocks have further to fall is based
on the idea the prolonged bull market has pushed stock prices too
high for long-term profit growth to satisfy.
</P>
<P>
   The bullish perspective is based on the continued strength of
the economy, accompanied by benign inflation and falling interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's forecast calls for gross domestic product
growth of 3.25 percent in 1998 and 2 percent to 2.5 percent in
1999; unemployment of 4.5 percent to 4.75 percent through next
year; and consumer inflation of only 1.75 percent to 2 percent in
1998 and 2 percent to 2.5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been a bear market _ generally defined as a drop
of at least 20 percent from a record level _ under those
conditions, according to the bulls.
</P>
<P>
   One of the factors that weighs on stock market analysis at this
stage of the game is that no other bull market has lasted this
long. That, plus the length of the economic expansion _
third-longest in U.S. history _ has prompted some to refer to this
as a ``new paradigm,'' in which the old rules are no longer in
play.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has paid at least
guarded respect to this thesis by mentioning it several times in
public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   But he prefers to describe the current market condition as a
``virtuous cycle,'' the term he used in his recent Humphrey-Hawkins
congressional testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In this scenario, the economic conditions that produced the bull
market attract investors in large numbers, whose buying propels the
bull market still higher. The ``wealth effect'' created by the bull
market, meanwhile, encourages investors to spend, which fuels the
economy's growth.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of a virtuous cycle is a ``vicious cycle,'' in
which falling stock prices wipe out wealth, causing investors to
retrench and spend less, which in turn slows the economy, resulting
in a recession and bear market. The slide is exacerbated by the
presence of huge amounts of debt, much of it used to buy stocks,
under this scenario.
</P>
<P>
   So far the downside scenario is just a scenario, and there are
those who consider it unlikely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Bullish analysts, such as Goldman Sachs strategist Abby Joseph
Cohen, deny that stocks are really as overpriced these days as the
bears contend. Low inflation supports higher valuations, she
argues.
</P>
<P>
   The bullish scenario is that economic strength, low inflation
and lots of baby boom investors will lengthen the bull market well
into the 21st century despite setbacks along the way.
</P>
<P>
   None of this debate may be of much consolation to a nervous
small investor, however, who probably wants most of all to know
what to do.
</P>
<P>
   David A. Lee, senior vice president and research coordinator at
Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta, says ``three actions are necessary at
this juncture'' for investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``First is a quick check of your current financial objectives,
including an update on goals and risk-taking capacity,'' he said.
``We frequently find that as stock prices move higher, investors
start to increase the risk level in their portfolios.''
</P>
<P>
   They do so by buying riskier stocks and by borrowing to finance
the purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The second step is to begin even now to think about year-end tax
planning, which may guide investor decisions about which stocks or
funds to sell.
</P>
<P>
   The third step is to look for ways to ``protect profits.'' It
requires homework, such as looking for stocks that analysts expect
to perform well in the near future under current circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's periods like this that drive people to focus on the
day-to-day and make very bad choices,'' said O'Shaughnessy. ``We
try to get people to see movements like these as a fact of life.
They have happened many times before and will happen again.''

 &HT;    Carefully evaluate legal advice on the Web
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you plan to put your faith _ and perhaps your
fortune _ in the hands of the gurus dispensing free legal advice on
the World Wide Web, you can only hope your next judge has a 17-inch
screen.
</P>
<P>
   But if you use the legal resources you find on the Web to
prepare yourself for a visit with a lawyer, it's possible to save
money and do a better job of preparing for that visit. Whether your
legal needs center on buying a house, getting a divorce or settling
the family estate, you'll find plenty of advice on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best advice you'll find _ and the best place to
start our tour on sites specializing in the law _ comes from a page
called Online Legal Advice: Let the Browser Beware at http://
www.nolo.com/nn223.html. It offers common-sense advice on how to
evaluate the legal information you'll find.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you'll be told to consider the source of the
information _ not all sites are equal. You're best served by a
lawyer operating in his or her field of expertise. In other words,
don't get estate planning advice from someone who specializes in
criminal law.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also be smart to make sure the information is up to date,
since the law changes as new legal decisions are made. Since it's
likely your own situation will be decided based on the law in the
state where you live, legal sites located in your state may be the
best bet. Also be wary of the ready-to-fill-in legal forms for
wills and divorces that you'll find on some sites. The real trick
isn't getting the form, it's knowing how to fill it in correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop is a site called Wired Law: Legal Information &AMP;
Advice on the Web at http://
</P>
<P>
   www.primenet.com/wiredlaw /links.htm. This site is especially
valuable because it contains links to many of the legal sites on
the Web, and because those links are organized according to topic.
So if your question concerns property law, for instance, you can go
directly to a site specializing in that field.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is almost certain. Your particular case or problem is
unique. That's why it's unlikely that simply browsing through the
information you find on the Web will be enough. Sooner or later, if
you decide to do more research before seeing a lawyer, you'll need
to go to a law library. Luckily, the law school at Atlanta's Emory
University has an online presence you'll find at http://
www.law.emory.edu/LAW/refdesk/toc.html. You'll be able to search
legal periodicals, law books and the federal statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Law students will also profit from this site, since it also
offers job search information. The site also offers information on
the laws in some other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, when you've followed the last link and read the
last convoluted legal article, it'll be time to find a lawyer. The
Internet also offers resources to help with that quest.
</P>
<P>
   Just stop by a page called FindLaw: Lawyers and Law Firms at
http://www.findlaw
</P>
<P>
   .com/14firms/index.html. Once there, you can search various
directories of lawyers and even take a look at a database that
offers legal aid advice and pointers. You'll also be able to use a
database compiled by the respected legal publishers, West and
Martindale-Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   You can search based on location or name, or you can use
keywords to find a lawyer with the right specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the sites visited today, there are no charges
associated with the service. In fact, as a final bit of legal
advice, most lawyers would tell you to avoid the cut-rate,
commercial legal sites you'll find on the Web. If advice is worth
what you pay for it, then the sites that offer to answer legal
questions for fees that range from $20 to $50 may be the most
expensive lawyers you'll ever meet.

 &HT;    Borrowing from 401(k) takes careful evaluation
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here's an alluring idea: The next time you need some
ready cash, borrow it from yourself. As you repay the loan, both
principal and interest will go to you, not to a lender.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound outlandish. But for many workers _ those who have
a 401(k) retirement plan with loan provisions _ it is an
increasingly attractive alternative.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 28 percent of 401(k) participants had borrowed against
their retirement accounts, according to the Profit Sharing/401(k)
Council of America. Those loans averaged about $5,500.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies suggest the percentage of self-borrowers is slowly
growing, as more Americans accumulate more capital in 401(k) plans.
After all, it's your money. Maybe you really need it now, perhaps
for a down payment on a house.
</P>
<P>
   But is a retirement plan loan a good idea?
</P>
<P>
   Retirement analysts and advisers get edgy when presented with
that question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not inherently bad,'' said analyst Paul Yakoboski of the
Employee Benefit Research Institute. ``It's an attractive feature
of these plans that gets people into them in the first place. But
you need to do a little calculating to find out what it's going to
cost you.''
</P>
<P>
   Most 401(k) plans have provisions for borrowing against your
balance. The limits and restrictions may vary, and there are some
fine points. In general, federal law allows you to borrow as much
as half of your account balance, to a maximum of $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Your employer's plan will usually list the permitted reasons for
borrowing, such as buying a house, medical emergencies or paying
for the kids' education. You must repay the loan within five years,
though you can take longer if you use the money for a house.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the numbers can get pretty depressing. Suppose you are 25
years old, and you borrow $5,000 and pay it back over five years,
the maximum allowed. If you pay 9.5 percent interest, or one point
above the prime rate, you'll shell out $1,301 in interest. That
goes back into your 401(k) and will continue earning for you.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose instead you left the money in your retirement account,
earning 11.1 percent _ the long-term average for large-company
stocks. In that alternative, all the money would have been working
for you throughout those five years.
</P>
<P>
   If you let those increased earnings compound for another three
decades or more, until you retire, you'll have tens of thousands
more dollars in your nest egg.
</P>
<P>
   There are other problem areas. The main one arises if you leave
your job, said Debra Zipp, a retirement planning specialist with
Waddell &AMP; Reed. Most plans require departing employees to repay an
outstanding balance within 30 to 90 days. If you can't do that, the
balance is considered to be in default. The company will usually
take the balance from your account, meaning you get back that much
less when you settle up.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Zipp said, you will owe income taxes on the unpaid
balance. Unless you are older than 59 1/2, you will owe a 10
percent early withdrawal penalty. Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   The same tax and penalty provisions apply if you stop making
your regular payments on the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Yakoboski worries about another possibility: Since people are
``paying themselves back,'' they will be tempted to reduce their
current contributions until the loan is repaid. The result will be
a considerably smaller retirement nest egg.
</P>
<P>
   There are advantages, of course. It's your own money you are
borrowing against, so you don't have to withstand a credit check.
In most plans, arranging the loan is not very complicated. Most
employers set up payroll deductions, so you can't let a payment
slide by unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a cheap loan, because the interest comes back to you,
not to a bank or credit card.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, a 401(k)-backed loan may make sense if the loan you
need is a short-term one, and if you can repay it quickly. It might
be a good idea if you use the money to pay off very high-interest
debt, like credit card bills.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to approach the subject with great caution. Remember
why you opened the account in the first place: It's a retirement
plan, not a piggy bank.

 &HT;    BUSINESS COMMENTARY: A legacy besides rock 'n' roll?
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Many people are so busy paying the bills they scarcely
notice how much wealth they are building up. At the end of each
month, their house may seem more like a money pit than an
appreciating asset. But time will change that for most.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the kids will move away, the mortgage will get paid
off and deceased parents will leave behind an inheritance. That
patrimony may be considerable: Economists estimate $12 trillion is
now in the hands of the fading World War II generation whose heirs
are the 76 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964.
</P>
<P>
   When those boomers themselves start dying off in significant
numbers _ around 2020 _ their estates will be up for grabs. While
many of today's workers are not saving enough money to generate
adequate cash in retirement, most are investing in assets, such as
homes and furnishings, that will be worth a great deal after they
die.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the baby boomers someday will have tens of
trillions of dollars to bequeath to others.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen with all that money? Will it get squandered by
spoiled heirs or put to good purposes? If it is spent well, the
aggregate wealth of the post-war generation could have a huge
impact on American life in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a big if.
</P>
<P>
   Unless more people start planning now, this immense fortune
could get wasted. Ron Chernow, author of ``Titan,'' a new biography
of John D. Rockefeller Sr., says dispensing money wisely is a
tougher job than most people realize.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller, the nation's richest man at the start of the
century, ``spent as much time giving away money as making it,''
Chernow said during a recent book tour in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire vastly improved life for millions by using his
money to spur the growth of libraries, universities and medical
institutions. Rockefeller's fortune had an enormous impact because
he spent decades teaching himself how to be an effective
benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   Many people assume that ``late in life, to atone for his sins,
Rockefeller suddenly turned to philanthropy,'' Chernow said. In
fact, he consistently gave money to his church starting from
childhood. His charitable work grew along with his wealth. By his
early 40s, he was no longer funding just Baptist activities but was
putting up the money for imaginative projects. For example, at age
43, he funded the creation of Atlanta's Spelman College so the
daughters of former slaves could be turned into schoolteachers.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Rockefeller retired, he was a world-class
philanthropist who knew that ``it takes work and it takes time to
give away money,'' Chernow said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, baby boomers are still focused on earning money and
aren't inclined to think about their own mortality. Drawing up a
will is no one's idea of fun. But time is passing. With the recent
deaths of so many boomer icons _ including ``Buffalo Bob'' and Roy
Rogers _ it's getting harder to pretend the post-war generation can
stay forever young. By getting involved with charities now, boomers
can begin learning how to leave some legacy besides rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always gigantic needs to be filled,'' Chernow said.
``It's a matter of having the creativity to give away money'' in
ways that go to the roots of society's problems, as Rockefeller did
when he funded libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always surprises me that no one has tried to open programs
to provide drug treatment'' to large numbers of poor people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the generation that introduced widespread drug use to
American culture could use some of its assets to help undo that
great harm in the next century.
</P>

 &HT;    Grass Roots fuels competition for gas customers
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Deregulation of Georgia's natural gas market doesn't
officially begin until Nov. 1. But don't tell that to Dave Rich,
who represents more than 7,000 Georgia consumers and is ready to
make a deal on their behalf for the best gas price once the market
is opened to competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Alpharetta, Ga. businessman saw an opportunity in late 1996,
when as a utility executive he was tracking the landmark
deregulation law as it moved through the Georgia General Assembly.
While large companies would certainly make out well in a
competitive market, he figured, ``no one really cared about the
small guy.''
</P>
<P>
   So a year ago, Rich left his job as a local wholesale
electricity and gas marketer for Missouri-based Utilicorp and
founded what is apparently a first-of-its-kind venture for the
energy industry: Grass Roots Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Grass Roots will act as a ``buyer's agent'' for thousands of
Georgians when competition in the natural gas industry begins this
fall. Seeing strength in numbers, it plans to negotiate lower rates
with the new marketing companies selling the gas.
</P>
<P>
   Rich plans to do the same for electricity when that industry is
decontrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Grass Roots won't take possession of the gas, bill customers or
read meters. But it will act as sort of a matchmaker between
consumer and marketing company.
</P>
<P>
   It's not actually selling anything, so it isn't bound by the law
requiring marketers to wait until Public Service Commission
certification Oct. 15 before they can start selling gas. Rich sees
room to negotiate ``the lowest rates available'' for his
subscribers and take a profit for him and his investors at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Buyer's agents for energy are nothing new. Pittsburgh-based
Strategic Energy Ltd., which represents large commercial and
industrial customers, has been retained by the Atlanta chapter of
the Building Owners and Managers Association to purchase gas for
members' office buildings in metro Atlanta, says Strategic Energy
spokesman Peter Tennis.
</P>
<P>
   But Grass Roots may be the first to enter mass markets for
residential and small-business customers using multilevel
marketing, which has been used to sell Amway products, Mary Kay
cosmetics and long-distance phone service.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is catching fire, at least with the ``independent
marketing representatives'' Rich is signing up. They show up twice
a week at meetings that are part pep rally, part ``Let's Make a
Deal,'' with a little Huey Long thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to be treated like a big guy is to become the
biggest guy. Come Nov. 1, we will command the lowest prices and
pass those on to the consumer,'' Rich told more than 200 people at
a recent ``opportunity meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been holding the meetings at the Crowne Plaza Ravinia Hotel
at Perimeter Center since March and recently moved the sessions to
a ballroom to accommodate the growing crowds. He hosts smaller
groups at his office on Thursday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   Rich has signed up 1,300 marketing reps who have brought in more
than 7,500 signed contracts with consumers. They go door-to-door,
or work by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Grass Roots pays the marketing reps $10 for every signed
contract they bring in, plus additional commissions and bonuses of
up to $30 per contract.
</P>
<P>
   With funding from private investors, Rich's prepared to spend up
to $4 million to get started, then move into other states as
deregulation spreads.
</P>
<P>
   By signing the contract, consumers authorize Grass Roots to
negotiate on their behalf for ``lower rates for natural gas and/or
electricity than I am currently paying.'' The contract is for one
year and authorizes the company to obtain billing histories from
Atlanta Gas Light Co., which will ultimately exit the gas sales
business when the industry is fully deregulated. The contracts are
automatically renewed for one-year terms, unless terminated by
either party.
</P>
<P>
   Rich acknowledges the contract will be difficult, if not
impossible, to enforce if a consumer decides to seek gas service
elsewhere. He estimates an attrition rate of up to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But he says he will have between 25,000 and 35,000 contracts in
hand by Nov. 1 and is shooting for 50,000 by the end of the year.
He says that would make Grass Roots customers collectively the
largest buyer of natural gas in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   One Grass Roots contract is with Kansas-based Applebee's
International and covers the restaurant chain's seven
corporate-owned Applebee's Neighborhood Grill &AMP; Bar and 10 Rio
Bravo restaurants in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energy is a huge expense for us,'' says William Kampbell,
national energy buyer for Applebee's. Gas grills boost monthly gas
charges to $2,500 for each of the restaurants, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Rich is confident marketers will want to make a deal to, in
effect, ``rent'' his customer list.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone who will be able to deliver 50,000 customers, they
(marketers) will bleed all over the floor,'' he says confidently
during an interview in his Duluth office.
</P>
<P>
   Rich says he's talked with most of the 28 companies that have
applied to market gas in the first phase of deregulation this fall
and has ``gotten indications of interest from a large number'' of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Carter, director of sales and marketing at Utilicorp
Energy Solutions, which has applied for certification to sell gas
in Georgia, says the Kansas City, Mo., company is ``interested in
what they have to offer.'' Carter says his company ``definitely
could offer a better rate'' to Grass Roots, if Rich signs up enough
customers to make it worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   But other marketing companies say they're not interested.
</P>
<P>
   Some are leery of what one top executive called the
``looseness'' of Rich's sales force and prefer to sign up their own
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Others regard Rich as a competitor who is using a loophole in
the deregulation law to sign up customers before they can, then
charge too much for his customer list.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Dawson, vice president/general manager at Columbia Energy
Services Corp., recently told Rich his proposition would not work
for the marketing affiliate of Columbia Gas of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't make it work so he would be able to make money and
we'd have enough to cover our expenses and go after the next round
of customers,'' Dawson says.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Darby, senior vice president of South Carolina-based
SCANA Energy who also has spoken with Rich, says SCANA would not
offer a ``special price'' to Grass Roots subscribers lower than
what it would offer to other customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard through the grapevine that a number of them
(marketers) do not want to see us in business,'' Rich says. ``We
have driven the cost down.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich, 43, says the main thing he has to offer companies is the
prospect of acquiring a huge bloc of customers without incurring
marketing expenses. He says $100 is a reasonable estimate of what
it would cost companies to acquire each new customer, given direct
mail, advertising and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Grass Roots is ``not looking for anywhere near that'' to sign
over a customer, Rich says. But he added he needs to charge at
least the $40 he ends up paying for each signed one-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton Payne, vice president of Atlanta Gas Light Services,
says the marketing affiliate of Atlanta Gas Light Co. ``will look
to acquire customers for substantially less'' than $100 each.
SCANA's Darby puts the cost at $50 per customer.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Gas Light Co. says average residential bills will run
$627 a year for consumers who stick with the utility during the
transition to deregulation. Rivals will already need to beat that
cost to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Latham, president of Optimum Energy Sources, says she
projects profits of $12 a year per customer and can't see where
there's room to pay a middleman like Rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there's some magic formula we haven't figured out,''
says Latham, who has also talked to Rich.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Rich is paying out money, not collecting it.
</P>
<P>
   He writes checks to his marketing reps monthly, based on the
number of signed contracts they deliver. This Friday, he says he'll
pay out $150,000 for July's contracts. Including that amount, Rich
says he will have paid marketing reps $240,000 for signed contracts
and collected $60,000 for marketing materials he sells them at
cost.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of commissions are in the $100 range, says
Rich, who added he wrote one check for one month's work for $5,000
to one rep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll put out a challenge,'' Rich told marketing reps at a
recent meeting. ``You folks make me run out of money.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Rich says he's spent more than $400,000 to launch the
business and is deferring his own salary until gas sales begin. He
says the money is coming from seven outside investors whom he
declines to identify. But he says they are not ``hidden investors''
from the energy industry and more than happy to pay for more
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year utility and financial services industry veteran says
he had no prior experience with multilevel marketing. The sales
technique ``has a terrible connotation,'' he tells his marketing
reps. ``It has earned it and it deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautions the reps against ``slamming,'' or illegally
switching suppliers without consumers' permission and makes it
clear recent gas bills must accompany contracts to qualify for
payment.
</P>
<P>
   PSC spokesman Shawn Davis says brokers like Grass Roots ``can be
a healthy part of competition'' so long as ``consumers are not
misled, are not 'slammed' and are not locked into a contract that
denies them the benefits of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   But there have been some apparently minor lapses by Rich's sales
force:
</P>
<P>
   _ In June, the Office of Consumer Affairs told Grass Roots to
``cease and desist'' after a sales representative circulated a
flier falsely claiming the company ``has the approval'' of the PSC.
</P>
<P>
   _ In July, Rich terminated agreements with three sales reps
after they were accused by the commission of using ``scare
tactics'' in unauthorized fliers that claimed Atlanta Gas Light
would stop selling gas altogether on Nov. 1. In fact, the company
will continue selling gas during a transition period. Afterward, it
will become a distribution company only.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the marketing reps have prior experience with part-time
marketing ventures. Some are government employees or work in
doctors' offices. Others are raising money for schools or churches.
</P>
<P>
   Fred DeVaughn is a College Park bank auditor and president of
the Band Boosters Club at Tri-Cities High School in East Point.
He's gearing up as soon as school starts Aug. 24 to sign up parents
as Grass Roots subscribers as part of a drive to raise $130,000 to
send the school's band to perform in London on Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is the wave of the future, I'm impressed,'' he said
after attending one of Rich's meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita White, 53, a Georgia state employee, heard about Grass
Roots at a church dinner and is going door-to-door in her
neighborhood to raise money to help with expenses of a liver
transplant. She says she's made more than $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knock on the door and say, 'Do you know about natural gas
deregulation?''' White says. ``They look at you funny. Nobody knows
about it.'' But, she says, ``I sign up almost everyone.''

 &HT;    A dent in insurance costs
 &HT;    (EDS: Runs with INSURANCE-SHOPPING11-COX.)
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ State Farm's announcement last month of a 2.6 percent
reduction in auto premiums for Georgia policyholders, totaling $21
million, was the 15th decrease by insurers this year in the state.
The other reductions totaled about $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting occasional payments of dividends to policyholders _
including $14.4 million in June _ State Farm's last rate decrease
in Georgia was 1991, which it attributed to the demise that year of
no-fault insurance.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm, Georgia's largest auto insurer, with 1.4 million
policyholders, joins a growing list of insurers nationwide that are
cutting premiums. As reasons, they cite competition, along with
better-built cars and older drivers who are driving more carefully,
resulting in lower claims and medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of what it costs to insure a car in Georgia, the
average annual expenditure for auto insurance was $627.47 in 1996,
latest data available, the 25th highest in the nation _ placing
Georgia right in the middle of the 50 states. New Jersey has the
highest average costs, $1,100. The cheapest is Iowa at $445.39
annually.
</P>
<P>
   And even lower premiums are expected, in Georgia and nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The $30 million premium decrease in Georgia so far this year is
less than 1 percent of the more than $3 billion in auto premiums
written annually in the state, but Georgia Insurance Commissioner
John Oxendine promises more is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auto insurance will be cheaper in Georgia next year than it is
this year,'' he said. The Insurance Information Institute, a
national group, has predicted the average cost of auto insurance
nationwide will decline about 1 percent this year, and hold steady
or decline slightly in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation
of America, thinks rate deceases should be considerably greater.
``Given the companies' profits, rates should fall 5 percent to 10
percent nationally,'' he said. ``I expect to see continued
reductions for at least the next two or three years.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the last full year of no-fault here, the average
expenditure for auto insurance in Georgia was $544.96, or 20th
highest among the 50 U.S. states, according to the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners. The General Assembly voted
to dump no-fault in 1991 and to return to traditional auto
insurance, with prior approval by the insurance commissioner
required for rate increases. The vote also required insurers to
reduce the premium for bodily-injury liability insurance by 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Ryles, when running for Georgia insurance commissioner in
1990, promised to cut auto insurance bills ``no ifs, no ands, no
buts.'' He was elected, and during the next four years, denied 176
requests by insurers for premium increases _ every request
presented to him by auto insurers.
</P>
<P>
   By 1992, Ryles' second year in office, the average had fallen to
this decade's low point of $514.47, the 29th highest in the nation.
In addition to Ryles' freeze on premium increases, the decline was
also due in part to the demise of no-fault insurance, which was
more expensive than traditional coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Oxendine, when running against Ryles in 1994, said he would
study each rate boost request for auto insurance and say yes or no,
depending on the facts. Oxendine won _ and has approved 101
increases during his term to date, about two-thirds of the increase
requests presented to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``From talking with some insurers, I get the impression they
felt they had some `catching up' to do after four years of no
increases,'' said David Colmans, executive director of the Georgia
Insurance Information Service, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Georgia's ranking nationwide in terms of average cost for
auto insurance is virtually unchanged. In 1991, Ryles' first year
in office, Georgia ranked 23rd. In 1996, the year for which latest
data are available and Oxendine's second year in office, Georgia
ranked 25th.
</P>
<P>
   For Oxendine, this year's premium decreases in Georgia come at a
fortunate time. He's running for re-election in November, and the
commissioner/
</P>
<P>
   candidate is happily announcing the rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   If Oxendine, 35, is elected to a second term, he will be ruling
on auto rate requests for the next four years. He has raised more
than $1.1 million for the campaign, many times more than his
Democratic opposition, former state Rep. Henrietta Canty, 69.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the $1.1 million was contributed in $1,000 donations
from individuals employed in the industries Oxendine regulates, and
they are invited to attend quarterly round-table meetings _ usually
breakfasts _ at private clubs. In addition to insurance
commissioner, Oxendine is state fire marshal and regulates small
loan companies.
</P>
<P>
   Oxendine has said such contributions don't affect his rate
decisions, but Hunter _ a former Texas insurance commissioner _ is
quick to condemn the practice. ``It's not good at all, very bad in
my opinion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing illegal, however, about such fund-raising, and
previous Georgia insurance commissioners have funded their
re-election campaigns in such ways. Ryles raised more than $1
million in his 1994 campaign, much of it from industry employees,
despite his wholesale denial of auto rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the State Ethics Committee fined Oxendine $500 for
accepting one improper donation. But his supporters point out the
committee ruled in 1993 that Ryles also had accepted a prohibited
donation.

 &HT;    Do some shopping around for insurance
 &HT;    (EDS: May run with INSURANCE-PREMIUMS11-COX.)
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia drivers paid an average of $627.47 for auto
insurance coverage in 1996, the latest data available _ an average
for all drivers, all cars, all locations. But many drivers paid far
more.
</P>
<P>
   That happened for several reasons, including one often
overlooked: They failed to shop around.
</P>
<P>
   Auto insurance companies are not all the same. Some concentrate
on drivers with safe records. Others concentrate on higher-risk
drivers. Some take on nearly all comers. And that means they don't
quote the same price for the same coverage. In fact, the price for
the same coverage for the same driver can vary dramatically from
firm to firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insurers generally target specific categories of drivers and
price their policies competitively for them, while charging
less-than-competitive rates for others,'' said Tom Blum, manager of
Consumer Reports' auto insurance price service.
</P>
<P>
   Auto insurers, however, use much the same criteria in quoting
rates: The driver's age, sex, marital status and driving record;
the year, make and model of car insured; the car's annual mileage
and its use, such as commuting or personal use; the driver's
residence; theft rates in the area; and frequency and severity of
accidents and claims in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Some factors that affect price are beyond your control, at least
to a degree. For example, if you live in Atlanta, you will pay more
_ probably substantially more _ for the same coverage than if you
live in a town in South Georgia. Where you live is very important,
and sometimes even a small change will make a huge difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some years ago, I moved three miles from the border of an
urban territory into a suburban territory, and my auto insurance
rates fell 50 percent with no other change in my driver's
profile,'' said Blum.
</P>
<P>
   To get a full picture of your choices, contact several big
companies that sell through their own exclusive agents, several
insurance brokers who represent a mix of independent insurers that
don't have their own agents, and several ``direct writers'' _
insurers who sell policies directly to the public over the
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   If you call enough insurers, you will find great differences in
quotes. The Consumer Reports' price service checked insurers'
quotes for a ``typical'' married couple in their mid-40s, with a
17-year-old son, living in a suburban area of northwest Atlanta,
with three autos and clean driving records. The service found
annual quotes that ranged from $2,875 to $6,590, for a policy with
$100,000/$300,000 bodily injury liability, $50,000 property
liability, and collision and comprehensive coverage with $500
deductibles.
</P>
<P>
   Shop around and, unless you have a terrible driving record, you
should get at least two or three quotes from insurers that want
your business and will offer the coverage you want at competitive
prices. But in comparing two or more offers, be sure you are
comparing ``similar'' companies and the same type of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   CHART: HOW TO SAVE MONEY ON AUTO INSURANCE
</P>
<P>
   When shopping for auto insurance, these are some ways to keep
your costs down:
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't insure against every nick and scratch. Collision is
often the highest premium you pay, and the bigger the collision
deductible you are willing to accept, the cheaper your coverage
will be. The same is generally true of comprehensive coverage, but
don't scrimp on liability coverage, which protects you from
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask for discounts, which can amount to substantial savings.
But many times, if you don't ask, you don't get.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy a car that costs less to insure. Expensive,
high-performance cars may be fun to drive, but they are expensive
to repair and therefore expensive to insure. Whatever the price of
the car, equip it with safety and anti-theft devices and you will
pay lower auto insurance.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are several things you or family members can do that
will result in lower premiums from some insurers. They include
passing a defensive-driving course, not smoking, being more than 50
years old, driving for three years without an accident and making
good grades in school.

 &HT;    Search engines of old jazzed up as portals
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You've probably been hearing a lot about portals on
the Internet lately. People buying portals, selling portals,
analysts predicting portals are the future.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, portal is a new name for Web sites that
used to be called ``search engines.'' The difference is that now
these search engines offer much more than just lists of sites: They
have everything from e-mail to free Web pages to stock quotes and
horoscopes. Furthermore, they are all betting the farm their
content will be so compelling and useful you will be willing to
change your browser settings just to look at them before you look
at anything else.
</P>
<P>
   But do these sites have what it takes to keep you coming back
every day? Take a look at the following portals and decide for
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! (http://www.yahoo.com) is winner and still champion of
portal sites, a start page chock-full of goods and services. And if
you want to search the Web, you can do that, too. Some of the
services it offers include travel arrangements, phone service,
Web-based instant messaging service, free e-mail, celebrity chats,
continuous news updates, special news sections and a variety of
other services too numerous to list here.
</P>
<P>
   But what pushes Yahoo! ahead of any and all competition is that
even your grandmother has probably seen ``chief Yahoos'' David Filo
and Jerry Yang counting their money on the cover of Time magazine.
And when it comes to the dizzying array of choices on the Web, to
borrow from Vince Lombardi, branding isn't everything, it's the
only thing.
</P>
<P>
   And although it seems like only yesterday NBC announced its
partnership in CNet's Snap! (http://www.snap.com), the site
unveiled its new look last week. While anything is an improvement
over the old Snap!, it's still impressive how far they've come.
</P>
<P>
   Snap!, like most portal sites, offers users the ability to
customize the site, but here all you have to do is punch in your
ZIP code and _ voila! _ you've got a personalized weather report
and other links every time you visit.
</P>
<P>
   Its special sections are as good as, if not better, than those
at Yahoo!. The section on the Monica Lewinsky scandal features
links to headlines from newspapers around the country as well as TV
and cable outlets not owned by NBC, giving the site bonus points
for truly trying to offer users the best of the Web. Snap! also has
a fun design scheme that's easy to look at and navigate.
</P>
<P>
   With a vast promotional campaign from NBC planned to coincide
with the new fall TV season, Snap! has a shot at becoming a major
portal player and leapfrogging over its competition.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the wonders of Yahoo! and the novelty of Snap!,
there are still some 35 million Netscape users who can't or won't
change their browser's default page from Netscape's Netcenter
(http://www.netscape.com). Netcenter's much-publicized face lift
this year has certainly spruced up the site, but there's still a
long way to go. You can search the Web, read the news from
ABCNews.com or download the newest version of Netscape and
corresponding plug-ins.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike Yahoo!, Netcenter's category listings don't
provide comprehensive lists of Web sites but instead offer a
selected ``best of breed'' list of sites that is rather short. What
portal you use may come down to how you like your searches, long
and comprehensive or short and sweet. Netcenter also has an
interesting take on branding, using Netscape's green, blue and
yellow color scheme. It's not real pretty, but you never forget
where you are.
</P>
<P>
   With its nifty slogan, ``Get Lycos or Get Lost,''
Massachusetts-based Lycos (http://www.lycos.com) pioneered the idea
of returning only top-rated sites to users, although users can
still search the Web for a broader search. Lycos is well-organized,
but it's hard to tell what services are available.
</P>
<P>
   The areas Lycos trumpets include its free e-mail service and
links to other search services such as CDNow, Barnes &AMP; Noble,
PeopleFind and CityGuide. Lycos also has a targeted news area
similar to Yahoo! and Snap!, but the links aren't as specific or as
focused as the other two. Through Lycos' sister company, Tripod,
users can build their own Web pages through a link on the site.
It's fun but not a reason in and of itself to push Lycos ahead of
the increasingly stiff competition.

 &HT;    Portable sound systems gain respect
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Those of us who traipsed off to college those many
years ago toting a stereo-in-a-box remember the feeling:
inadequacy.
</P>
<P>
   Components spoke of seriousness about sound, of
blow-down-the-doors audio power and money. But portable stereos
that contained a tape deck, radio tuner and turntable that you
folded up and carried under an arm? That spoke of ... well, it
spoke of a limited budget.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, it was nice to have some kind of sound system, and it
did squeeze nicely into the back of the Chevy. But down the hall
was at least one dorm-mate whose stereo speakers had the heft of
the Chevy itself and whose amplifier was capable of lethal doses at
100 meters. Size might not be everything, but come on.
</P>
<P>
   Fold-'em-up stereos were always a discount alternative.
</P>
<P>
   And yet lately, the science of audio has nudged us closer to a
world in which convenient packaging can compete with components. We
have wireless phones that slip into your pocket, and we have
all-in-one stereo systems that claim to compete with the Big Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most aggressive makers has been Bose Corp., whose
marketing is built around the notion potent and accurate sound can
come roaring out of small speakers. A decade ago, Bose pioneered
``The Wave,'' a portable system the company dared to match against
component systems.
</P>
<P>
   Now Marantz America offers its own entry. The package, brags
Marantz, ``makes no apologies to conventional expectations of what
a stereo system should look like.'' The MR2020 is scheduled to be
in the stores this month at a suggested retail price of $1,000.
This system, boasts Marantz, ``establishes a dramatic new esthetic
in fully integrated music systems.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's pretty good for a portable.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, dial up the Marantz site on the Web
(http://www.marantzamerica.com) or call the company (708-307-2687).
</P>
<P>
   Can't keep it all
</P>
<P>
   Computers seemed at first like the answer to a pack rat's
prayer. Or a historian's.
</P>
<P>
   When you can't decide which sticky yellow notes to keep and
which ones to chuck, well, you understand. There's only so much
room, and some of that stuff really has to go.
</P>
<P>
   But when you have documents by the dozen in your computer, you
figure you can save them all -- or what's a digital memory for? It
may turn out that saving everything is neither easy nor cheap. And
maybe it's not right, either.
</P>
<P>
   Deanna B. Marcum, president of the Council on Library and
Information Resources, wrote recently that when you start talking
about millions of pages and files, the preservation of data for
years and decades is a huge financial investment. It not only fills
the hardware with bits and bytes, it commits the data to software
that might soon be obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The New York Times, Marcum said the real point is not
expense, anyway. Collections through history have been shaped by
the critical judgment of people who did more than just hit the
``save'' button, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Librarians and archivists know that a good collection, like a
good book, is made in the editing,'' Marcum writes.
</P>
<P>
   Fax by Net
</P>
<P>
   Makers of gadgets are increasingly looking for ways to use the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newest Net-friendly tools is the Panasonic KX-FP26OM,
a fax machine that includes a copier, speakerphone, printer and
scanner. According to Popular Mechanics magazine, the Panasonic
lets you send a fax anywhere via the Net, saving long-distance
phone charges.
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic says the machine will be available in September for
$279.95.
</P>
<P>
   For information, contact Panasonic (1-800-222-4213).
</P>
<P>
   How're we doin'?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike baseball, business doesn't always provide a scoreboard to
let you know how you are doing.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have benchmarks and goals, and if you can't measure
your progress as a business against where you have been and where
you want to be, then how do you really know where you are? Now, if
all this sounds somewhat New Age, then consider there is software
from various manufacturers that is aimed at letting businesses find
out if they are meeting expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the current offerings recommended by Windows Magazine in
its summer issue (http://www.winmag.com) is Business Plan Pro 2.0
from Palo Alto Software and Plan Write for Business 4.0 from
Business Resources Software.
</P>
<P>
   Business Plan Pro, which costs $100, provides a 16-step,
interactive guide that lets you check your numbers against your
original forecast. If you don't like what you see, you can also
concoct a new plan. For more information, call Palo Alto Software
(1-800-229-7526).
</P>
<P>
   Plan Write guides you through creation of business objectives,
product descriptions and customer profiles. It gives you charts for
break-even, cash flow and profit and loss. The software costs $130.
For more information, contact Business Resources Software by phone
(1-800-423-1228 or 512-251-7541).

 &HT;    Time for a day's break from all-intrusive technology
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I am here today to propose a new national holiday. I
don't think it'll be as much fun as Christmas, or as important as
Mother's Day, but I'm pretty sure it will catch on.
</P>
<P>
   I propose we have a National Low Tech Day. Instead of writing
e-mail to a friend, send them a letter or visit them. Balance your
checkbook by hand. Leave your cellular telephone at home. I'm
suggesting we start right now. Let's make today, the day you read
this column, the first annual observance.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my bet. Instead of finding that your day is more crowded,
you'll have some leisure time for a change. I know computers and
such-like are supposed to make our lives easier. But if computers
and technology continue to make things easier, I'm going to quit my
job and join the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the line I've lost my sweetly naive belief in
the supposition that all this high-tech stuff makes me more
productive and leaves me with more time for leisure. You'd think
I'd be in the catbird seat as far as reaping the benefits of
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Because of my job writing about technology, I have more
electronic and computer gear in my home than the average Navy
destroyer. And when I sit down at my desk at work, I stare at two
computers _ a top-of-the-line Macintosh G3 and a super-fast Pentium
II PC _ that sit close together like two buzzards after a good day
for road kill. At work I stay logged on to the Internet using a T1
line that offers a high-speed connection. I'm well connected at
home, too.
</P>
<P>
   I have computer programs to help me cook a meal, figure my
finances, select a wine, plan a wedding, sue a creditor, buy a
house, build a house, learn to oil paint, figure out why I'm so
neurotic, tell my fortune, discover a new career, do my horoscope,
create my family tree, build a deck and learn to play bridge.
</P>
<P>
   I have a dishwasher with more computer power than the original
Univac; my car has a computer, and so does the exercise bike that I
use, and my cat plays with computerized toys.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a new gadget hits the market, it's likely that the
manufacturer sends one to the newspaper for us to try. I spend more
on batteries than the average guy.
</P>
<P>
   But _ with all this computing power and gadgetry _ I have no
time at all. In fact, half the time my gadgets and computers
conspire to steal time from me. This morning, I spent an hour
trying to get the office's new e-mail program to work; last week my
car had to have a computer module replaced, so that meant a long
evening at the repair shop. We use a telephone system so
complicated that everyone here had to take a training class just to
be able to use it. I've seen grown men get quivery at the notion of
trying to use our copying machine.
</P>
<P>
   If the computer gurus here at the newspaper upgrade the word
processing system one more time, I'm pretty sure it'll stop working
altogether. And our new high-tech elevators went online here about
two months ago. The day after they went into service, I was trapped
in one for an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I'm ready to celebrate Low Tech Day. I think most of
us need a day when we escape from these electronic servants that
have _ somehow _ become our masters.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not advocating a return to the Dark Ages, but just a day
where we stop and think about how technology often uses us, instead
of us it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's time to celebrate. So get out your hammock and a good
paperback book. And plug yourself into a lazy day.

CHRISTIANITY'S DIVISIONS ARE AS DEEP AS EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I never like to learn I was right about something I wish weren't
true. But in the case at hand, the road toward that discovery was
so fascinating that it was almost worth the sad news. Here's what
happened: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Clinton visited South Africa this spring, he attended
Mass at Soweto's Regina Mundi Roman Catholic Church. The priest,
under the false impression that South Africa's bishops had changed
policies and now allowed non-Catholics to receive Communion, passed
that on to the White House advance team in writing. So the
president, a Southern Baptist who regularly attends a United
Methodist Church in Washington, participated in the Eucharist. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there was an outcry. And an outcry about the outcry.
The Catholic position, after all, is ``transubstantiation,''
meaning the bread and wine used in this re-enactment of Jesus' Last
Supper become Christ's actual body and blood in all but appearance.
The Protestant belief is less literal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I wrote a column about the controversy, bemoaning the rifts in
Christianity from my perspective as an elder in a Presbyterian
church. It ran in not only in my paper, The Kansas City Star, but
also in several other papers around the country because the New
York Times News Service syndicates my work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately I began receiving e-mail from readers. Some
praised the column. Some thought it theologically ignorant. Some
just wanted to berate Clinton for many sins. Others wished to
educate me about Catholicism. (One nice Cincinnati grandmother
phoned to invite me to join her Catholic church.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail was so fascinating I kept copies of it, without quite
knowing why. Some samples:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Like your poster boy Bill Clinton, you are dead wrong on so
much. . . There is nothing wrong with Christian churches sharing
simple, common things together. . .but you and your kind are asking
that basic tenets of my faith be changed to accommodate yours. It's
like coming to my house this evening and expecting to be fed supper
without being in my family or even invited, and then complaining
about how and what we cook. Get real.'' _ A Roman Catholic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``It has been one of my greatest pains of faith that, even at
my brother's funeral Mass, following his death at the hands of a
drunk driver when he was 30, I was still denied the sacrament.'' _
A United Methodist pastor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Clinton claims to be a Christian. . .It is clear he has
never known Jesus.'' _ A Protestant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``. . .I am still astounded at how controversial and difficult
even small steps toward unity can be.'' _ A Presbyterian pastor.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The divisions between the various branches of the Christian
faith are a scandal.'' _ A United Church of Christ pastor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I appreciate what you were trying to do, but frankly you
have it pretty much all wrong. . .To be sure, Christendom is
divided into literally thousands of sects. But this is not the
fault of the Catholic Church but, rather, of the revolutionaries
that tried to rip it apart. There is no `broad umbrella of
Christianity.' There is only the church that Jesus founded and
those denominations that are in revolt against it.'' _ A convert to
Catholicism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``For anyone to receive Holy Communion in a Catholic ceremony
without believing in transubstantiation is in essence demeaning
this sacrament.'' _ A Catholic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On and on it went, in some ways proving my column's point that
Christianity's sad divisions won't be healed before history ends.
When the volume of the response began to exceed almost anything I
had experienced in more than 20 years of writing a newspaper
column, it occurred to me that it might be wonderful if all of the
people talking just to me could talk to each other. I'm no
technology genius, but I know how to create an e-mail message to
send to dozens of people at once. So I sent a note inviting them to
participate in this discussion by first responding to the official
Catholic rules on taking the Lord's Supper. We began there but then
roamed widely. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The debate became, in some ways, an intra-Catholic fight.
Transubstantiation hard-liners wanted to keep non-Catholics from
receiving the Eucharist. Other Catholics sought a different
formulation that might lead to common ground. But it's ground we
never found. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The discussion now has almost stopped, but it lasted several
months. There was some deeply personal sharing but also some
nastiness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I like to think everyone learned something, but when it was over
the main result was that one man in California announced he'd
decided to return to church. My naive dream of reaching a position
all of us could buy, however, remained unfulfilled. Our talk proved
only that Christianty continues to be intractably divided. And that
is both its great sadness and its shame. &QL;

 &HT;    And dinner, too, as supermarket delis serve food fast
 &HT;    By Danielle Herubin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. _ Kathy Gehrke wanted something to eat.
Something good. Cheap. Fast. And a place to sit.
</P>
<P>
   She got Salisbury steak, $2.99, including two side dishes and a
dinner roll. She was dining in less than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A new item at McDonald's? No. She stopped at a grocery store _
Publix. And judging by the steady stream of people who ordered up
and sat down during a typical lunch hour last week, the supermarket
on Northlake Boulevard in Palm Beach Gardens is denting the
business of nearby fast-food restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   A grocery industry study found that fast-food places have lost
market share: 37 percent of consumers say they eat at a fast-food
restaurant when they want quick meals, down from 41 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''As consumers have become more time-starved, the supermarket
industry realized that we could provide not only staples, but we
could also provide them their next meal,'' said Sherrie Rosenblatt,
a spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C.-based Food Marketing
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The trend in dining at supermarkets _ essentially small
restaurants that expand on the old deli concept _ isn't new. But
it's becoming more common in Palm Beach County as market leaders
Publix and Winn-Dixie build new stores and remodel old ones.
</P>
<P>
   Publix began building supermarkets with restaurants about eight
years ago, said Carmen Millares, the Lakeland-based company's
community affairs manager in Miami. The chain is trying to meet all
of a shopper's needs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We noticed that, when customers go out . . . that they have
many needs to take care of, and we're trying to let them make them
all in just one stop,'' Millares said. ''They want pictures of
birthday parties, they need money for their shopping, they're tired
and want a coffee, or a guy wants to take flowers to his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County's two main supermarket chains make decisions
differently on where to offer in-store dining.
</P>
<P>
   Publix does it randomly, Millares said. Jacksonville-based
Winn-Dixie puts the restaurants in most new stores, including its
supermarkets near the RiverWalk subdivision on Okeechobee Boulevard
in West Palm Beach and on Military Trail in west Boynton Beach.
Boise, Idaho-based Albertson's Inc. is offering coffee bars in some
stores and beginning to offer delis with limited seating.
Albertson's spokesman Michael Read said dine-in areas are put in
suburban stores, where residents have higher incomes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not full-blown,'' Reid said. ''We are not doing it in
every store. It's fairly limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's opened its first supermarket restaurant in Texas;
its first in Florida, near Clearwater, opened about seven months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Diners seem to be satisfied with the fare, which ranges from
salads to sandwiches to hot meals.
</P>
<P>
   The Publix on Northlake was packed during lunch one day last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's convenient, fast, and people here are nice people,'' said
Marc Weinstein, 30, an assistant service manager at the nearby
Schumacher Automotive.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said he likes ''everything'' at the deli, and the
prices are right: $2.39 for an Italian sub, $2.29 for a steak
burger, $2.99 for fish and chips.
</P>
<P>
   Publix spokeswoman Millares said 30 to 40 of the company's 465
stores in Florida have dine-in delis. Three are in Palm Beach
County. Martin and St. Lucie counties have none.
</P>
<P>
   Winn-Dixie spokesmen said they were unable to say how many of
their stores have dine-in delis.

 &HT;    Classes help minorities bridge technology gap
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Bobby Smith's son, Brico, suggested he try an
evening computer class, he hesitated. After all, he used a computer
at work and wondered what more there was to learn. He took the
plunge anyway, and that's how Brico, Smith and his wife all signed
up for Derrick Brown's class at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the computer just at work, I did not realize all the
things you can do with the Internet and in other ways that are such
fun,'' Smith said. ``I am glad I did it, and now I tell everybody
to try it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Smith family of Decatur, Ga. happens to be African-American,
and their experience underlines the findings in studies that blacks
are often involved less in the computer age than the population at
large. Often, however, encouragement and opportunity can fire their
enthusiasm about computers.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, trained as an electrical engineer, has devoted himself to
teaching others about computers, and this year he has conducted a
summer-long workshop, with twice-a-day sessions. Using space in the
Tech student center donated by the school, and employing equipment
donated by industry, he has attracted some 75 people, including
youngsters and adults.
</P>
<P>
   The material covered has been broad, including familiarization
with the equipment, uses of Windows software, connection with the
Internet and even trouble-shooting so students get deeper
understanding of the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The classes are pleasantly informal, and Brown _ who received a
master's degree in electrical engineering from Georgia Tech in 1994
_ banters easily with his students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students have learned, but we have learned plenty, too,''
said Brown. ``We have found that though everybody wants to learn,
they do so at very different speeds, and so we will need to
separate kids, young adults and seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, ``I am more determined than ever to continue
to update and refine the program, and get more equipment, to make
the program work ideally.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, through a nonprofit firm he organized called
KnowledgeBase Inc., has spent much of his time in recent years
developing plans for teaching computers and information technology
in metro Atlanta. He has also been an organizer and leader of the
Black Graduate Student Association at Georgia Tech. Although the
summer program in computer literacy concludes Sept. 15, Brown said
he is in the process of planning further studies that may be
available in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to believe that learning computers and more about
technology is important to everybody because it is empowering to
communities and individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech, through its community outreach program, also
coordinates and helps sponsor classes at two of Atlanta's largest
public housing communities _ Red Oak and Boatrock.
</P>
<P>
   Those programs started off at a gallop two years ago, but have
slowed lately, said Teressa Warfield-Francis, the program
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started with good initial interest,'' she said. ``But
lately we have faced a challenge in getting people to understand
the connection between computer literacy and their future. We have
found that people either have an interest, which grows, or they
have little interest at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Trish Millines of Seattle knows a thing or two about the
problems and challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Millines retired from Microsoft in 1996 as a software developer
to devote her dollars and time to teaching computer literacy in
inner city Seattle. She established a nonprofit organization called
Technology Access Foundation to train youngsters in computers,
instill a love of learning and then reward them with internships in
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has gone well after our first full year of the program,''
she said. ``But there is always a challenge in impressing on
youngsters the importance of the concept we are developing _ that
computer literacy and the accompanying increase in skill and
self-esteem _ are absolutely essential to their future.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing, she said, ``There is a tremendous amount of work to
be done to close the gap between the technological haves and
have-nots.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the challenges, said Brown, is to find equipment to keep
up with the skills and expectations of the students, especially the
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like kids everywhere and in every walk of life, they love
speed,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``And no sooner than they learn the elementary points, they want
to surf the Internet faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as we all do.

 &HT;    No easy cure for rural health care ills
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLACOOCHEE, Ga. _ Their lunch of hamburgers, slaw, baked
potatoes and cobbler had come and gone. Yet 15 of the regulars at
the Senior Citizen Center here stayed an hour longer to talk of the
upcoming health care crisis in their South Georgia town.
</P>
<P>
   A medical clinic, located a couple of miles away, is set to
close. And except for one physician in his 70s, who is close to
retiring, the town would be without medical services.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people get hurt, they'll have to go 20 miles to get to a
doctor,'' said Eddie Perkins, 76, a Medicare recipient. ``A lot of
us don't have transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Link, 85, a diabetic, said a physician assistant at the
clinic had helped her improve her health. ``I walk five blocks now
every morning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The expected closing of MedCare Willacoochee isn't a matter of
finding medical providers or patients. Clinic operators said the
doors to the double-wide trailer will shut because of a state
policy over payment for services delivered by physician assistants,
known as PAs.
</P>
<P>
   To politicians, business leaders and residents here, the rule
appears unfair, even absurd. The state agency that runs Medicaid,
the Department of Medical Assistance, said it's in the process of
studying its PA regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the clinic's plight also illustrates the fragility of
health care services in rural areas of Georgia and elsewhere. And
it shows how economic development in such communities can hinge on
access to medical services.
</P>
<P>
   Until earlier this year, MedCare Willacoochee was operated by a
Lakeland, Fla., hospital, and received reimbursement from Medicaid
for services delivered by a PA.
</P>
<P>
   But in March, the hospital decided to close the clinic and
another in nearby Pearson. Both communities are between Tifton and
Waycross in south Georgia. At that point, two PAs, Bobby Tucker and
Arlene Gottlieb, and their supervising doctor, Dr. Robert Bowman,
decided to keep the Willacoochee center open themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care about my patients,'' Tucker said. ``If we are not here,
they're going to suffer. I've got patients who come up here on a
bicycle. They're not going to ride a bicycle to Waycross.''
</P>
<P>
   The three were making a go of it until June, when they were told
Medicaid, the federal-state program serving 1 million low-income
Georgians, can't pay for their PA services anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Under Medicaid rules, a doctor must be on the
premises at all times for PA payment at a private clinic.
</P>
<P>
   But at a hospital outpatient center, or one labeled a ``rural
health center,'' a physician doesn't have to be on site during all
PA services for Medicaid to reimburse.
</P>
<P>
   The Willacoochee clinic had those labels until the hospital
relinquished control. Bowman, who works as an emergency room
physician in the area, can be there only 10 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   So despite having the same personnel and patients, and providing
the same services as before, the clinic now can't get Medicaid to
pay it for past months of PA services _ or future ones. And about
30 percent of the clinic's patients are Medicaid recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, the federal program serving those 65 and older, will
reimburse the PAs at the clinic. And private insurance does, too.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid's on-site doctor requirement goes beyond the state's
own PA regulations in rural or urban areas, according to the
Georgia Association of Physician Assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bauer, a legislative consultant for the association, cited
the Georgia medical board's rules on ``remote'' medical sites.
``The doctor has to be there 25 percent of the time,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Here and elsewhere, physician assistants can practice medicine
only under the supervision of doctors. But while they must be
available by phone as a PA works, doctors generally don't have to
be physically present during those services.
</P>
<P>
   PAs aren't directly reimbursed, but payments go to the employer
or physician for services delivered by a PA.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of PAs perform primary care. Their duties include
physical exams, diagnosis and treatment of illnesses, orders of lab
tests and suturing of wounds. About 1,700 PAs are working in
Georgia, according to the GAPA.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid does allow nurse practitioners to be reimbursed without
a physician on site. ``There's a difference in the practice act for
nurse practitioners; they have more authority than PAs,'' said Mark
Trail, deputy commissioner of DMA. ``They have to have a physician
on call. Their practices are limited by protocols.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Trail said DMA has contacted the state medical board to
see whether the Willacoochee clinic would qualify under the board's
``remote site'' designation.
</P>
<P>
   Though Trail said the Willacoochee situation is an isolated one,
GAPA said it's indicative of larger issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is access,'' said Kathy Kemle, a GAPA leader. ``In
most rural areas, there is not a sufficient patient base to support
a physician.''
</P>
<P>
   Willacoochee has only 1,500 residents. But it does appear to
have an unusual level of industry for a small town.
</P>
<P>
   A new Langboard Inc. fiberboard plant, for example, will employ
130. The clinic's departure, said Langboard personnel director Joy
Schunhoff, ``is going to be a big problem for us. We use the
facility for pre-employment physicals and drug screens, and we were
planning to use them for on-the-job injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Willacoochee would have had trouble wooing the Langboard plant
without the clinic there, said Lace Futch, of the Southeast Georgia
Regional Development Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with something that's vital to that community,''
Futch added. ``Someone needs to get across to the Medicaid board
the impact they're having on rural areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Access to health care has worried many rural communities. Some
are in danger of losing their hospital to financial problems.
Medicare and Medicaid have ratcheted down payments, and private
insurance, through managed care, has forced hospitals to accept
deep discounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Legislature has taken notice, and some rural
hospitals have formed a for-profit company to attract managed care
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if a hospital goes under, jobs and industry are
endangered. And if doctors and other medical professionals
disappear, an area's medical needs _ and economic ones _ can
multiply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you lose a (medical provider) in a rural area, it
hurts,'' said Willacoochee pharmacist James Carter. ``If you lose
one in Macon or Atlanta, it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Willacoochee alone can't sustain a physician, added Jerome
Crosby, a vice president of Peoples Bank in Willacoochee. But he
added: ``A physician assistant can be here daily. But one little
quirk in the law makes them ineligible to be paid. Somebody needs
to step in and waive this policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use them myself, and my children go there.''
</P>
<P>
   As do other community leaders, such as county commissioners Jack
Taft and Chester Brown. The Fleetwood plant, down Ga. 82 from the
clinic, uses MedCare Willacoochee for injuries and drug screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really upset they can't stay,'' said JoAnn Courson,
production coordinator for the mobile home manufacturer. ``When you
have someone hurt on the job, they don't want to ride 20 to 30
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman, Tucker and Gottlieb have worked basically without pay
during the first months as a private clinic. It could have sought
designation as a rural center _ and received reimbursement for PA
services _ but the cost of meeting the paperwork burden would have
been prohibitive, Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   DMA tried to be helpful, added Bowman, the supervising doctor.
But he said the agency, when rejecting their request, also asked
the clinic to continue to see its Medicaid patients _ without
getting paid _ until they could be switched to other doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But residents want the clinic to stay open. Bill Yawn credits it
with saving his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had heartburn or indigestion,'' said Yawn. It was
actually a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   When Yawn dropped by, PA Gottlieb ran an electrocardiogram,
contacted Bowman and a cardiologist, faxed the EKG to both, and
sent Yawn to a Valdosta hospital. ``If MedCare wouldn't have been
there, I wouldn't have gone to see anyone,'' Yawn said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients say they're comfortable with the PA care. Olga
Contreras was hired in the office partly because she can translate
the Spanish spoken by the clinic's Hispanic patients.
</P>
<P>
   At the senior center, Clara Lee Mercer, 61, found a seat at the
long lunch table. She has gone to the Willacoochee clinic for
osteoarthritis, borderline diabetes and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have found things wrong (with me) that no other doctors
have found,'' said Mercer, a Medicaid recipient. There were tears
behind her eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been a blessing to me. They treat you like family.''

 &HT;    Visual Page program solid tool for editing, creating Web sites
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Symantec's new Visual Page seems primed to give
Microsoft's Front Page some stiff competition in the niche for Web
page creation programs aimed at the casual user.
</P>
<P>
   Visual Page is a fairly straightforward tool for setting up Web
pages with or without frames. The greatest problem I found was with
its documentation, which wastes the entire ``Getting Started''
booklet showing you how to edit and improve an existing Web site.
</P>
<P>
   If for whatever reason you want to switch HTML editors or go
from one of the competing what-you-see-is-what-you-get programs,
this is certainly a splendid feature. But how many people who buy
this product are going to have an existing Web site they want to
edit?
</P>
<P>
   They are going to want to start from scratch, I should think.
All, however, is not lost, since the ``User Guide'' provides plenty
of information on creating a page from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   Visual Page includes a special edition of Symantec's WebPainter,
a program intended for creating banners and art for your site. It
is, however, so obtuse all I managed to do was continually cause it
to lock up. Of course, there's always the possibility that I'm
obtuse, too.
</P>
<P>
   Pages are created simply by typing and bringing in objects _
lines, bullets and images _ in a very straightforward manner.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up hyperlinks works somewhat differently than Front
Page. In Front Page, when you want to set up a link to another page
within the site, you are given the option of creating that linked
page at once if it doesn't already exist. In Visual Page, the page
to be linked to has to be already available _ not finished, but at
least started.
</P>
<P>
   You can view each page in your browser _ Netscape or Explorer _
as you work, a very nice way of checking up on how things are
looking. As a matter of fact, if you have both of them installed,
you can check the appearance in both.
</P>
<P>
   Like some page design programs, you can create layers, and lines
and spaces can be adjusted in small increments with the cursor
keys, a very nice feature.
</P>
<P>
   You can, of course, create text in Visual Page, and there's a
spell-checker in the program. On the other hand, you can import
text from your word processor in the same way you would import
graphics. Text, incidentally, can be flowed around an image just as
it can be done in a page layout program.
</P>
<P>
   Cascading style sheets and font family management are available
to help keep some continuity in a page. Links can be automatically
checked and updated to keep your site current.
</P>
<P>
   For those who wish to work in HTML code, there is a color-coded
syntax editor, but I should think a real coder would be embarrassed
to use such a tool.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that when winter arrives and I have more time at my
disposal, I shall create a new personal Web page, and unless
something better comes along I'll do it in Visual Page.

 &HT;    Unions get combative as economy soars
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Corporate America, get ready to rumble.
</P>
<P>
   More confrontations between management and workers are likely if
the economy remains healthy and worker shortages continue.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's prosperity and record corporate profits are
producing gutsier workers. This summer's high-profile strike at
General Motors may be just the beginning of growing confrontation
from workers who held their tongues during the lean times. Despite
vastly improved corporate financial performance, annual pay raises
for the average worker have stayed at about 4 percent. Union wage
boosts have been about 2 percent to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``CEOs are making and getting raises that blow your mind,'' said
Richard Ray, secretary-treasurer of Georgia AFL-CIO, an umbrella
group representing about 300,000 workers in about 1,000 locals.
About 11 percent of Georgia's workers belong to unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want what we have earned in our workplaces,'' said Ray.
``And for those who have not had the opportunity to be union
members, they're saying, `We want a union in our workplace so that
we can protect ourselves.'''
</P>
<P>
   The same issues that prompted a walkout of the GM workers _ pay,
work rules and job security _ seem to embody the unfolding clash
between workers and management elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, many workers who once meekly accepted whatever
companies gave them are forming unions _ or picket lines _ to get
what they want. Even workers who don't belong to unions feel more
confident about their worth these days, and companies are offering
generous perks to recruit and retain them. Job-hopping is rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity has turned out to be the much-needed bargaining chip
for organized labor, which seems ill-prepared to make the
transition from an industrialized economy to a business world
increasingly characterized by high technology and global
investment. Union membership has fallen from a peak of about 24
percent of the nation's work force in the 1970s to about 15 percent
today.
</P>
<P>
   No one is predicting unions will regain the power they had in
the 1970s, but organizing and other union activity is up. Just
about every major union _ from the Teamsters to the Communications
Workers of America to the United Auto Workers _ is at the
bargaining table negotiating important contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations at the bargaining table have been raised,''
said Jeff Mintz, Atlanta-based partner in the law firm of Jackson
Lewis Schnitzler &AMP; Krupman, which represents management in labor
disputes and has increasingly been called on to give talks on labor
relations and averting strikes. ``We have seen an increase in
organizing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately (for us), business is quite good,'' said Mintz.
``If things don't work at the current place of employment, they
(workers) have many more options today than they had in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as electrician Ben E. Myers Jr., a union member, puts it:
``Most workers feel this is the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers, a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers Local 613 in Atlanta, said: ``Times are very good. Profits
are up, our productivity has gone through the roof. We've taken
concessions in the past, and it's time now to get our living wage
up to a higher standard.''
</P>
<P>
   If recent weeks are any indication, labor-management showdowns
are far from over. Tension is growing across the board.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy turbulence is threatening several of the nation's airline
carriers. On Thursday, talks broke off between AirTran and its
flight attendants, and the union representing them plans a series
of selective strikes around Labor Day. They want their pay brought
in line with the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Northwest, the nation's No. 4 carrier, is at odds
with four of its five employee unions. The pilots are set to walk
at the end of the month if talks disintegrate further, possibly
creating major disruptions in air travel for the public. Machinists
said no to a proposed contract last week and gave union leaders the
go-ahead to strike if further talks fail. And flight attendants
who've been trying to get a new contract staged a series of rallies
around the country late last week in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Little progress has been made since workers at Anheuser-Busch,
which has 520 workers at its Cartersville, Ga. brewery, rejected a
pact in July, the second time in three months. Workers gave union
leaders the go-ahead to strike if a suitable pact couldn't be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Enterprises narrowly averted a strike
last week, reaching an agreement with workers at four Toronto
plants.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, one of Georgia's largest employers, resolved
down-to-the-wire talks, avoiding its first strike since the Baby
Bell was created from the 1984 AT&AMP;T divestiture.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes at United Parcel Service last year and General
Motors this summer were costly. GM alone lost more than $2 billion
in profits. Teamsters are pushing for a contract for about 4,000
workers at Overnite Transportation, the largest nonunion trucking
firm. Workers at Overnite in Atlanta and other cities recently
staged a one-day strike in support.
</P>
<P>
   For many workers, job security is a bigger issue than pay.
Companies are doing well, but workers don't have confidence their
jobs will be there for them long-term.
</P>
<P>
   For companies, the old work rules carved out by unions in the
past don't apply in a global economy that runs on turn-on-a-dime
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are recognizing that in order to survive they need
more flexibility in who they hire, how they work, when they work
and in what positions, and that flexibility flies in the face ...
of union practices and traditional union agreements,'' says Carol
D'Amico, senior researcher at Hudson Institute, a public policy
research group in Indianapolis. ``Workers aren't going to be doing
the same job every day or every hour in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Such strategic shifts have created the current stalemate between
labor and management.
</P>
<P>
   The healthy economy may give unions more leverage now, but the
investment decisions that companies make may determine the
long-range winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may win a short-term victory like GM but lose the war,''
said Bruce Kaufman, a Georgia State University economics professor.
``The companies make short-term concessions, but they go back to
the executive suites and come up with long-range strategies about
their capital investments that ultimately result in unionized
plants being downsized or closed, and over the long run union jobs
go elsewhere.''

 &HT;    And dinner, too, as supermarket delis serve food fast
 &HT;    By Danielle Herubin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. _ Kathy Gehrke wanted something to eat.
Something good. Cheap. Fast. And a place to sit.
</P>
<P>
   She got Salisbury steak, $2.99, including two side dishes and a
dinner roll. She was dining in less than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A new item at McDonald's? No. She stopped at a grocery store _
Publix. And judging by the steady stream of people who ordered up
and sat down during a typical lunch hour last week, the supermarket
on Northlake Boulevard in Palm Beach Gardens is denting the
business of nearby fast-food restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   A grocery industry study found that fast-food places have lost
market share: 37 percent of consumers say they eat at a fast-food
restaurant when they want quick meals, down from 41 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''As consumers have become more time-starved, the supermarket
industry realized that we could provide not only staples, but we
could also provide them their next meal,'' said Sherrie Rosenblatt,
a spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C.-based Food Marketing
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The trend in dining at supermarkets _ essentially small
restaurants that expand on the old deli concept _ isn't new. But
it's becoming more common in Palm Beach County as market leaders
Publix and Winn-Dixie build new stores and remodel old ones.
</P>
<P>
   Publix began building supermarkets with restaurants about eight
years ago, said Carmen Millares, the Lakeland-based company's
community affairs manager in Miami. The chain is trying to meet all
of a shopper's needs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We noticed that, when customers go out . . . that they have
many needs to take care of, and we're trying to let them make them
all in just one stop,'' Millares said. ''They want pictures of
birthday parties, they need money for their shopping, they're tired
and want a coffee, or a guy wants to take flowers to his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County's two main supermarket chains make decisions
differently on where to offer in-store dining.
</P>
<P>
   Publix does it randomly, Millares said. Jacksonville-based
Winn-Dixie puts the restaurants in most new stores, including its
supermarkets near the RiverWalk subdivision on Okeechobee Boulevard
in West Palm Beach and on Military Trail in west Boynton Beach.
Boise, Idaho-based Albertson's Inc. is offering coffee bars in some
stores and beginning to offer delis with limited seating.
Albertson's spokesman Michael Read said dine-in areas are put in
suburban stores, where residents have higher incomes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not full-blown,'' Reid said. ''We are not doing it in
every store. It's fairly limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's opened its first supermarket restaurant in Texas;
its first in Florida, near Clearwater, opened about seven months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Diners seem to be satisfied with the fare, which ranges from
salads to sandwiches to hot meals.
</P>
<P>
   The Publix on Northlake was packed during lunch one day last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's convenient, fast, and people here are nice people,'' said
Marc Weinstein, 30, an assistant service manager at the nearby
Schumacher Automotive.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said he likes ''everything'' at the deli, and the
prices are right: $2.39 for an Italian sub, $2.29 for a steak
burger, $2.99 for fish and chips.
</P>
<P>
   Publix spokeswoman Millares said 30 to 40 of the company's 465
stores in Florida have dine-in delis. Three are in Palm Beach
County. Martin and St. Lucie counties have none.
</P>
<P>
   Winn-Dixie spokesmen said they were unable to say how many of
their stores have dine-in delis.

 &HT;    Less-invasive heart surgery gives many families hope
 &HT;    (EDS: Rerences to ``last'' Tuesday and Friday CQ for Aug. 5th,
7th.)
 &HT;    By Chuck McGinness
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Eight-year-old Olivia Bell will have
quite a story to tell her classmates about how she spent her summer
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Olivia, who will be a third-grader in Palm City, Fla., returned
home last Friday after surgery to close a quarter-sized hole in her
heart.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes Olivia's tale especially interesting is that she
was the first patient at Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital in
Hollywood (Fla.) to have open-heart surgery using a new,
less-invasive technique.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure, video-assisted thoracic surgery, allowed Dr.
Robert Jaquiss, the hospital's pediatric cardiac surgeon, to use a
much smaller incision to sew a patch over the hole in Olivia's
heart. This type of operation does not require the breast bone to
be cut open, and allows the patient to recover much quicker than
traditional open-heart surgery. It leaves a scar that is barely
noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   Olivia had the operation last Tuesday afternoon and was running
around the medical center Friday morning as her parents filled out
her discharge papers.
</P>
<P>
   Jaquiss said he learned the technique from Dr. David Bichell, a
cardiac surgeon at Boston Children's Hospital, who is credited with
pioneering the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olivia was eating popsicles four to five hours after
surgery,'' Jaquiss said. ``I can't imagine how it could have gone
any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivia's parents, Rick and Jan Bell, learned about their
daughter's condition on May 20, her birthday. Their cardiologist,
Dr. Harry Bayron, recommended Jaquiss perform the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Artrial Septal Defect is one of the most common heart defects in
children. A small hole between the right and left sides of the
heart allows oxygen-filled blood from the left side to flow back to
the right side. The oxygen-filled blood then passes through the
lungs again, eventually causing lung congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters with the affliction are usually sluggish and develop
respiratory infection and pulmonary hypertension in the lungs.
Because she wasn't always running around like other kids, Olivia's
parents thought she simply liked quiet activities.
</P>
<P>
   Olivia said she was not scared about the operation, but was glad
to be home so she could play with her friends and 4-year-old sister
Claudia.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said that it was all so easy, it was no big deal,'' older
sister Kate Wells said. ``We're all dumbfounded about how well
she's doing.''

 &HT;    No easy cure for rural health care ills
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLACOOCHEE, Ga. _ Their lunch of hamburgers, slaw, baked
potatoes and cobbler had come and gone. Yet 15 of the regulars at
the Senior Citizen Center here stayed an hour longer to talk of the
upcoming health care crisis in their South Georgia town.
</P>
<P>
   A medical clinic, located a couple of miles away, is set to
close. And except for one physician in his 70s, who is close to
retiring, the town would be without medical services.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people get hurt, they'll have to go 20 miles to get to a
doctor,'' said Eddie Perkins, 76, a Medicare recipient. ``A lot of
us don't have transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Link, 85, a diabetic, said a physician assistant at the
clinic had helped her improve her health. ``I walk five blocks now
every morning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The expected closing of MedCare Willacoochee isn't a matter of
finding medical providers or patients. Clinic operators said the
doors to the double-wide trailer will shut because of a state
policy over payment for services delivered by physician assistants,
known as PAs.
</P>
<P>
   To politicians, business leaders and residents here, the rule
appears unfair, even absurd. The state agency that runs Medicaid,
the Department of Medical Assistance, said it's in the process of
studying its PA regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the clinic's plight also illustrates the fragility of
health care services in rural areas of Georgia and elsewhere. And
it shows how economic development in such communities can hinge on
access to medical services.
</P>
<P>
   Until earlier this year, MedCare Willacoochee was operated by a
Lakeland, Fla., hospital, and received reimbursement from Medicaid
for services delivered by a PA.
</P>
<P>
   But in March, the hospital decided to close the clinic and
another in nearby Pearson. Both communities are between Tifton and
Waycross in south Georgia. At that point, two PAs, Bobby Tucker and
Arlene Gottlieb, and their supervising doctor, Dr. Robert Bowman,
decided to keep the Willacoochee center open themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care about my patients,'' Tucker said. ``If we are not here,
they're going to suffer. I've got patients who come up here on a
bicycle. They're not going to ride a bicycle to Waycross.''
</P>
<P>
   The three were making a go of it until June, when they were told
Medicaid, the federal-state program serving 1 million low-income
Georgians, can't pay for their PA services anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Under Medicaid rules, a doctor must be on the
premises at all times for PA payment at a private clinic.
</P>
<P>
   But at a hospital outpatient center, or one labeled a ``rural
health center,'' a physician doesn't have to be on site during all
PA services for Medicaid to reimburse.
</P>
<P>
   The Willacoochee clinic had those labels until the hospital
relinquished control. Bowman, who works as an emergency room
physician in the area, can be there only 10 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   So despite having the same personnel and patients, and providing
the same services as before, the clinic now can't get Medicaid to
pay it for past months of PA services _ or future ones. And about
30 percent of the clinic's patients are Medicaid recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, the federal program serving those 65 and older, will
reimburse the PAs at the clinic. And private insurance does, too.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid's on-site doctor requirement goes beyond the state's
own PA regulations in rural or urban areas, according to the
Georgia Association of Physician Assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bauer, a legislative consultant for the association, cited
the Georgia medical board's rules on ``remote'' medical sites.
``The doctor has to be there 25 percent of the time,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Here and elsewhere, physician assistants can practice medicine
only under the supervision of doctors. But while they must be
available by phone as a PA works, doctors generally don't have to
be physically present during those services.
</P>
<P>
   PAs aren't directly reimbursed, but payments go to the employer
or physician for services delivered by a PA.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of PAs perform primary care. Their duties include
physical exams, diagnosis and treatment of illnesses, orders of lab
tests and suturing of wounds. About 1,700 PAs are working in
Georgia, according to the GAPA.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid does allow nurse practitioners to be reimbursed without
a physician on site. ``There's a difference in the practice act for
nurse practitioners; they have more authority than PAs,'' said Mark
Trail, deputy commissioner of DMA. ``They have to have a physician
on call. Their practices are limited by protocols.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Trail said DMA has contacted the state medical board to
see whether the Willacoochee clinic would qualify under the board's
``remote site'' designation.
</P>
<P>
   Though Trail said the Willacoochee situation is an isolated one,
GAPA said it's indicative of larger issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is access,'' said Kathy Kemle, a GAPA leader. ``In
most rural areas, there is not a sufficient patient base to support
a physician.''
</P>
<P>
   Willacoochee has only 1,500 residents. But it does appear to
have an unusual level of industry for a small town.
</P>
<P>
   A new Langboard Inc. fiberboard plant, for example, will employ
130. The clinic's departure, said Langboard personnel director Joy
Schunhoff, ``is going to be a big problem for us. We use the
facility for pre-employment physicals and drug screens, and we were
planning to use them for on-the-job injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Willacoochee would have had trouble wooing the Langboard plant
without the clinic there, said Lace Futch, of the Southeast Georgia
Regional Development Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with something that's vital to that community,''
Futch added. ``Someone needs to get across to the Medicaid board
the impact they're having on rural areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Access to health care has worried many rural communities. Some
are in danger of losing their hospital to financial problems.
Medicare and Medicaid have ratcheted down payments, and private
insurance, through managed care, has forced hospitals to accept
deep discounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Legislature has taken notice, and some rural
hospitals have formed a for-profit company to attract managed care
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if a hospital goes under, jobs and industry are
endangered. And if doctors and other medical professionals
disappear, an area's medical needs _ and economic ones _ can
multiply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you lose a (medical provider) in a rural area, it
hurts,'' said Willacoochee pharmacist James Carter. ``If you lose
one in Macon or Atlanta, it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Willacoochee alone can't sustain a physician, added Jerome
Crosby, a vice president of Peoples Bank in Willacoochee. But he
added: ``A physician assistant can be here daily. But one little
quirk in the law makes them ineligible to be paid. Somebody needs
to step in and waive this policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use them myself, and my children go there.''
</P>
<P>
   As do other community leaders, such as county commissioners Jack
Taft and Chester Brown. The Fleetwood plant, down Ga. 82 from the
clinic, uses MedCare Willacoochee for injuries and drug screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really upset they can't stay,'' said JoAnn Courson,
production coordinator for the mobile home manufacturer. ``When you
have someone hurt on the job, they don't want to ride 20 to 30
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman, Tucker and Gottlieb have worked basically without pay
during the first months as a private clinic. It could have sought
designation as a rural center _ and received reimbursement for PA
services _ but the cost of meeting the paperwork burden would have
been prohibitive, Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   DMA tried to be helpful, added Bowman, the supervising doctor.
But he said the agency, when rejecting their request, also asked
the clinic to continue to see its Medicaid patients _ without
getting paid _ until they could be switched to other doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But residents want the clinic to stay open. Bill Yawn credits it
with saving his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had heartburn or indigestion,'' said Yawn. It was
actually a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   When Yawn dropped by, PA Gottlieb ran an electrocardiogram,
contacted Bowman and a cardiologist, faxed the EKG to both, and
sent Yawn to a Valdosta hospital. ``If MedCare wouldn't have been
there, I wouldn't have gone to see anyone,'' Yawn said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients say they're comfortable with the PA care. Olga
Contreras was hired in the office partly because she can translate
the Spanish spoken by the clinic's Hispanic patients.
</P>
<P>
   At the senior center, Clara Lee Mercer, 61, found a seat at the
long lunch table. She has gone to the Willacoochee clinic for
osteoarthritis, borderline diabetes and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have found things wrong (with me) that no other doctors
have found,'' said Mercer, a Medicaid recipient. There were tears
behind her eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been a blessing to me. They treat you like family.''

 &HT;    Visual Page program solid tool for editing, creating Web sites
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Symantec's new Visual Page seems primed to give
Microsoft's Front Page some stiff competition in the niche for Web
page creation programs aimed at the casual user.
</P>
<P>
   Visual Page is a fairly straightforward tool for setting up Web
pages with or without frames. The greatest problem I found was with
its documentation, which wastes the entire ``Getting Started''
booklet showing you how to edit and improve an existing Web site.
</P>
<P>
   If for whatever reason you want to switch HTML editors or go
from one of the competing what-you-see-is-what-you-get programs,
this is certainly a splendid feature. But how many people who buy
this product are going to have an existing Web site they want to
edit?
</P>
<P>
   They are going to want to start from scratch, I should think.
All, however, is not lost, since the ``User Guide'' provides plenty
of information on creating a page from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   Visual Page includes a special edition of Symantec's WebPainter,
a program intended for creating banners and art for your site. It
is, however, so obtuse all I managed to do was continually cause it
to lock up. Of course, there's always the possibility that I'm
obtuse, too.
</P>
<P>
   Pages are created simply by typing and bringing in objects _
lines, bullets and images _ in a very straightforward manner.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up hyperlinks works somewhat differently than Front
Page. In Front Page, when you want to set up a link to another page
within the site, you are given the option of creating that linked
page at once if it doesn't already exist. In Visual Page, the page
to be linked to has to be already available _ not finished, but at
least started.
</P>
<P>
   You can view each page in your browser _ Netscape or Explorer _
as you work, a very nice way of checking up on how things are
looking. As a matter of fact, if you have both of them installed,
you can check the appearance in both.
</P>
<P>
   Like some page design programs, you can create layers, and lines
and spaces can be adjusted in small increments with the cursor
keys, a very nice feature.
</P>
<P>
   You can, of course, create text in Visual Page, and there's a
spell-checker in the program. On the other hand, you can import
text from your word processor in the same way you would import
graphics. Text, incidentally, can be flowed around an image just as
it can be done in a page layout program.
</P>
<P>
   Cascading style sheets and font family management are available
to help keep some continuity in a page. Links can be automatically
checked and updated to keep your site current.
</P>
<P>
   For those who wish to work in HTML code, there is a color-coded
syntax editor, but I should think a real coder would be embarrassed
to use such a tool.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that when winter arrives and I have more time at my
disposal, I shall create a new personal Web page, and unless
something better comes along I'll do it in Visual Page.

 &HT;    Carefully evaluate legal advice on the Web
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you plan to put your faith _ and perhaps your
fortune _ in the hands of the gurus dispensing free legal advice on
the World Wide Web, you can only hope your next judge has a 17-inch
screen.
</P>
<P>
   But if you use the legal resources you find on the Web to
prepare yourself for a visit with a lawyer, it's possible to save
money and do a better job of preparing for that visit. Whether your
legal needs center on buying a house, getting a divorce or settling
the family estate, you'll find plenty of advice on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best advice you'll find _ and the best place to
start our tour on sites specializing in the law _ comes from a page
called Online Legal Advice: Let the Browser Beware at http://
www.nolo.com/nn223.html. It offers common-sense advice on how to
evaluate the legal information you'll find.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you'll be told to consider the source of the
information _ not all sites are equal. You're best served by a
lawyer operating in his or her field of expertise. In other words,
don't get estate planning advice from someone who specializes in
criminal law.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also be smart to make sure the information is up to date,
since the law changes as new legal decisions are made. Since it's
likely your own situation will be decided based on the law in the
state where you live, legal sites located in your state may be the
best bet. Also be wary of the ready-to-fill-in legal forms for
wills and divorces that you'll find on some sites. The real trick
isn't getting the form, it's knowing how to fill it in correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop is a site called Wired Law: Legal Information &AMP;
Advice on the Web at http://
</P>
<P>
   www.primenet.com/wiredlaw /links.htm. This site is especially
valuable because it contains links to many of the legal sites on
the Web, and because those links are organized according to topic.
So if your question concerns property law, for instance, you can go
directly to a site specializing in that field.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is almost certain. Your particular case or problem is
unique. That's why it's unlikely that simply browsing through the
information you find on the Web will be enough. Sooner or later, if
you decide to do more research before seeing a lawyer, you'll need
to go to a law library. Luckily, the law school at Atlanta's Emory
University has an online presence you'll find at http://
www.law.emory.edu/LAW/refdesk/toc.html. You'll be able to search
legal periodicals, law books and the federal statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Law students will also profit from this site, since it also
offers job search information. The site also offers information on
the laws in some other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, when you've followed the last link and read the
last convoluted legal article, it'll be time to find a lawyer. The
Internet also offers resources to help with that quest.
</P>
<P>
   Just stop by a page called FindLaw: Lawyers and Law Firms at
http://www.findlaw
</P>
<P>
   .com/14firms/index.html. Once there, you can search various
directories of lawyers and even take a look at a database that
offers legal aid advice and pointers. You'll also be able to use a
database compiled by the respected legal publishers, West and
Martindale-Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   You can search based on location or name, or you can use
keywords to find a lawyer with the right specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the sites visited today, there are no charges
associated with the service. In fact, as a final bit of legal
advice, most lawyers would tell you to avoid the cut-rate,
commercial legal sites you'll find on the Web. If advice is worth
what you pay for it, then the sites that offer to answer legal
questions for fees that range from $20 to $50 may be the most
expensive lawyers you'll ever meet.

 &HT;    Greusome death-laced tour: Only in California
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``You'll recall how Jack Haley got a heart as the
Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz ,'' our tour guide says as the long,
gray funeral car approaches his old Beverly Hills home. ``Well,
here's where it suddenly stopped ticking on June 6, 1979.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, any Hollywood tourist can buy a map off a street corner and
see where the stars live. It's much more fun, in a morbid sense, to
see where they died. Especially if they went out in a sizzling
blaze of embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Grave Line Tours is a gleefully ghoulish alternative to the
countless sightseeing charters that herd tourists into buses and
vans in front of the famed Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard.
Passengers with a taste for the macabre pay $44 to pile into a 1969
Cadillac hearse for a 2-hour trip through Tinseltown's
scandal-ridden past.
</P>
<P>
   The 80 ``kooky and spooky attractions'' visited include the
high-priced digs where Sal Mineo and Bugsy Siegel were murdered;
the ``suicites'' where Freddie Prinze, Alan Ladd and Superman 's
George Reeves took their own lives; the hotels and nightspots where
Janis Joplin, John Belushi and River Phoenix died of overdoses; and
the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Courtney Street. ``Hugh Grant
made history here,'' tour guide Ray Savage says with a snicker.
</P>
<P>
   Just added are Frank Sinatra's home and the public restroom
where singer George Michael gave his infamous solo performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like watching the news at night,'' said Greg Smith, Grave
Line's director of undertakings. ``Instead of taking the news to
the people, we take the people to the news. We just kind of do it
in reverse _ to see where the real `Dead Man's Curve' was, or if
you go to England, to stand on the spot where Anne Boleyn lost her
head. To look around and think, `Ew, this is the last view she
had.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a student of Hollyweird history, founded Grave Line Tours
in October 1988. The service has since become one of the town's
most popular offbeat attractions, as well as a featured answer in
Trivial Pursuit and on Jeopardy!
</P>
<P>
   Smith plans to open similarly irreverent tours of Chicago and
Kansas City, Mo., this year, along with a crawl through New York
City's seedy underbelly in 1999 and London in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Grave Line draws locals and tourists alike. ``This goes back to
Shakespeare: `Tell sad stories about the death of kings,' '' said
Ardis Moe, an L.A. AIDS researcher taking the tour with her friend
Jim Menard, a wildlife official visiting from Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Each passenger receives a celebrity death certificate _ we opted
for ``probable suicide'' Marilyn Monroe _ along with annotated maps
of Westwood and Hollywood Memorial Parks and directions to sites
not on the tour route, such as Nicole Brown Simpson's former condo.
</P>
<P>
   We end up riding in a gray funeral car this day because the
hearse's brakes failed during the morning tour. ``This thing's a
death trap,'' Savage said before swapping it for the limousine.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of good brakes becomes apparent when Savage
wildly swerves and weaves the limo down Benedict Canyon, where
Richard Dreyfuss flipped his car while on drugs. He also drives
erratically, accompanied by the recorded sound of screeching tires
and breaking glass, as the limo rounds `Dead Man's Curve,' where
Jan Berry crashed his sports car in 1966, and again as we pass
Jayne Mansfield's palatial pink mansion. ``She lost her head.''

 &HT;    Classes help minorities bridge technology gap
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Bobby Smith's son, Brico, suggested he try an
evening computer class, he hesitated. After all, he used a computer
at work and wondered what more there was to learn. He took the
plunge anyway, and that's how Brico, Smith and his wife all signed
up for Derrick Brown's class at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the computer just at work, I did not realize all the
things you can do with the Internet and in other ways that are such
fun,'' Smith said. ``I am glad I did it, and now I tell everybody
to try it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Smith family of Decatur, Ga. happens to be African-American,
and their experience underlines the findings in studies that blacks
are often involved less in the computer age than the population at
large. Often, however, encouragement and opportunity can fire their
enthusiasm about computers.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, trained as an electrical engineer, has devoted himself to
teaching others about computers, and this year he has conducted a
summer-long workshop, with twice-a-day sessions. Using space in the
Tech student center donated by the school, and employing equipment
donated by industry, he has attracted some 75 people, including
youngsters and adults.
</P>
<P>
   The material covered has been broad, including familiarization
with the equipment, uses of Windows software, connection with the
Internet and even trouble-shooting so students get deeper
understanding of the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The classes are pleasantly informal, and Brown _ who received a
master's degree in electrical engineering from Georgia Tech in 1994
_ banters easily with his students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students have learned, but we have learned plenty, too,''
said Brown. ``We have found that though everybody wants to learn,
they do so at very different speeds, and so we will need to
separate kids, young adults and seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, ``I am more determined than ever to continue
to update and refine the program, and get more equipment, to make
the program work ideally.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, through a nonprofit firm he organized called
KnowledgeBase Inc., has spent much of his time in recent years
developing plans for teaching computers and information technology
in metro Atlanta. He has also been an organizer and leader of the
Black Graduate Student Association at Georgia Tech. Although the
summer program in computer literacy concludes Sept. 15, Brown said
he is in the process of planning further studies that may be
available in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to believe that learning computers and more about
technology is important to everybody because it is empowering to
communities and individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech, through its community outreach program, also
coordinates and helps sponsor classes at two of Atlanta's largest
public housing communities _ Red Oak and Boatrock.
</P>
<P>
   Those programs started off at a gallop two years ago, but have
slowed lately, said Teressa Warfield-Francis, the program
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started with good initial interest,'' she said. ``But
lately we have faced a challenge in getting people to understand
the connection between computer literacy and their future. We have
found that people either have an interest, which grows, or they
have little interest at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Trish Millines of Seattle knows a thing or two about the
problems and challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Millines retired from Microsoft in 1996 as a software developer
to devote her dollars and time to teaching computer literacy in
inner city Seattle. She established a nonprofit organization called
Technology Access Foundation to train youngsters in computers,
instill a love of learning and then reward them with internships in
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has gone well after our first full year of the program,''
she said. ``But there is always a challenge in impressing on
youngsters the importance of the concept we are developing _ that
computer literacy and the accompanying increase in skill and
self-esteem _ are absolutely essential to their future.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing, she said, ``There is a tremendous amount of work to
be done to close the gap between the technological haves and
have-nots.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the challenges, said Brown, is to find equipment to keep
up with the skills and expectations of the students, especially the
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like kids everywhere and in every walk of life, they love
speed,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``And no sooner than they learn the elementary points, they want
to surf the Internet faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as we all do.

   Within seconds, the rigid tube becomes as pliable as a rubber
band, ready to be molded into loops or angles in Lowry's workworn
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Like a modern-day Vulcan, Lowry has spent the better part of 50
years in sweltering shops, creating colorful neon signs through the
unlikely marriage of glass and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   While it's not the only neon business in the area, Lowry's Neon
Art shop remains a small, pop-and-son operation and a fixture in
East Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an exciting life,'' says Lowry, standing in his
workshop on a muggy summer afternoon. ``I've met some people and
some real corkers too.''
</P>
<P>
   A few fans try to keep the air moving and the heat is stifling
in the shop surrounded by neon enticements for ``Draft On Tap'' and
``Bud Lite.''
</P>
<P>
   People keep telling him he should get air conditioning. Lowry
never got around to it. Probably never will.
</P>
<P>
   At 81, Lowry has no plans to slow down: ``I'll go on as long as
the Lord lets me. What are you going to do? My brothers retired and
they died.''
</P>
<P>
   One of 13 children, Lowry moved with his family from Kentucky to
Dayton, where he attended the old Steele High School.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, he used the GI Bill to attend a school to
learn the craft that became his life's work.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good time to get into the business.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas was arising from the sands of the Nevada desert and
the glitz of the neon-lit casino strip was breathing new life into
bright tubular signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those old theatres downtown used to be lit by lightbulbs,''
says Lowry, recalling Dayton's history from a signage perspective.
``Then after the war, neon came on.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says with finality, ``it's part of our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Oblivious to the heat, he holds a glass tube over a blue flame
until it's pliable. Then he molds it by placing it on a prepared
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Part chemist, part artist, he demonstrates the technique
involved in evacuating air from a tube and filling it with gases
that lend it bright, eye-catching hues.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about neon,'' says Lowry, peering out from behind
thick lenses, ``it grows on you.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been some concessions to technology. Today, Lowry's
son, Bob, will use a computer to create patterns for signs. But
much of Lowry's work has remain unchanged since his Steubenville
days.
</P>
<P>
   Some consider neon cheap and gaudy, he allows. But now, he adds
with a hint of amusement, old neon signs are considered
collectibles. He spends as much time repairing old signs as
creating new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these years,'' says the neon signmaker, ``I'm still
fascinated.''

 &HT;    Search engines of old jazzed up as portals
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You've probably been hearing a lot about portals on
the Internet lately. People buying portals, selling portals,
analysts predicting portals are the future.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, portal is a new name for Web sites that
used to be called ``search engines.'' The difference is that now
these search engines offer much more than just lists of sites: They
have everything from e-mail to free Web pages to stock quotes and
horoscopes. Furthermore, they are all betting the farm their
content will be so compelling and useful you will be willing to
change your browser settings just to look at them before you look
at anything else.
</P>
<P>
   But do these sites have what it takes to keep you coming back
every day? Take a look at the following portals and decide for
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! (http://www.yahoo.com) is winner and still champion of
portal sites, a start page chock-full of goods and services. And if
you want to search the Web, you can do that, too. Some of the
services it offers include travel arrangements, phone service,
Web-based instant messaging service, free e-mail, celebrity chats,
continuous news updates, special news sections and a variety of
other services too numerous to list here.
</P>
<P>
   But what pushes Yahoo! ahead of any and all competition is that
even your grandmother has probably seen ``chief Yahoos'' David Filo
and Jerry Yang counting their money on the cover of Time magazine.
And when it comes to the dizzying array of choices on the Web, to
borrow from Vince Lombardi, branding isn't everything, it's the
only thing.
</P>
<P>
   And although it seems like only yesterday NBC announced its
partnership in CNet's Snap! (http://www.snap.com), the site
unveiled its new look last week. While anything is an improvement
over the old Snap!, it's still impressive how far they've come.
</P>
<P>
   Snap!, like most portal sites, offers users the ability to
customize the site, but here all you have to do is punch in your
ZIP code and _ voila! _ you've got a personalized weather report
and other links every time you visit.
</P>
<P>
   Its special sections are as good as, if not better, than those
at Yahoo!. The section on the Monica Lewinsky scandal features
links to headlines from newspapers around the country as well as TV
and cable outlets not owned by NBC, giving the site bonus points
for truly trying to offer users the best of the Web. Snap! also has
a fun design scheme that's easy to look at and navigate.
</P>
<P>
   With a vast promotional campaign from NBC planned to coincide
with the new fall TV season, Snap! has a shot at becoming a major
portal player and leapfrogging over its competition.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the wonders of Yahoo! and the novelty of Snap!,
there are still some 35 million Netscape users who can't or won't
change their browser's default page from Netscape's Netcenter
(http://www.netscape.com). Netcenter's much-publicized face lift
this year has certainly spruced up the site, but there's still a
long way to go. You can search the Web, read the news from
ABCNews.com or download the newest version of Netscape and
corresponding plug-ins.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike Yahoo!, Netcenter's category listings don't
provide comprehensive lists of Web sites but instead offer a
selected ``best of breed'' list of sites that is rather short. What
portal you use may come down to how you like your searches, long
and comprehensive or short and sweet. Netcenter also has an
interesting take on branding, using Netscape's green, blue and
yellow color scheme. It's not real pretty, but you never forget
where you are.
</P>
<P>
   With its nifty slogan, ``Get Lycos or Get Lost,''
Massachusetts-based Lycos (http://www.lycos.com) pioneered the idea
of returning only top-rated sites to users, although users can
still search the Web for a broader search. Lycos is well-organized,
but it's hard to tell what services are available.
</P>
<P>
   The areas Lycos trumpets include its free e-mail service and
links to other search services such as CDNow, Barnes &AMP; Noble,
PeopleFind and CityGuide. Lycos also has a targeted news area
similar to Yahoo! and Snap!, but the links aren't as specific or as
focused as the other two. Through Lycos' sister company, Tripod,
users can build their own Web pages through a link on the site.
It's fun but not a reason in and of itself to push Lycos ahead of
the increasingly stiff competition.

 &HT;    Greusome death-laced tour: Only in California
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``You'll recall how Jack Haley got a heart as the
Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz ,'' our tour guide says as the long,
gray funeral car approaches his old Beverly Hills home. ``Well,
here's where it suddenly stopped ticking on June 6, 1979.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, any Hollywood tourist can buy a map off a street corner and
see where the stars live. It's much more fun, in a morbid sense, to
see where they died. Especially if they went out in a sizzling
blaze of embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Grave Line Tours is a gleefully ghoulish alternative to the
countless sightseeing charters that herd tourists into buses and
vans in front of the famed Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard.
Passengers with a taste for the macabre pay $44 to pile into a 1969
Cadillac hearse for a 2-hour trip through Tinseltown's
scandal-ridden past.
</P>
<P>
   The 80 ``kooky and spooky attractions'' visited include the
high-priced digs where Sal Mineo and Bugsy Siegel were murdered;
the ``suicites'' where Freddie Prinze, Alan Ladd and Superman 's
George Reeves took their own lives; the hotels and nightspots where
Janis Joplin, John Belushi and River Phoenix died of overdoses; and
the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Courtney Street. ``Hugh Grant
made history here,'' tour guide Ray Savage says with a snicker.
</P>
<P>
   Just added are Frank Sinatra's home and the public restroom
where singer George Michael gave his infamous solo performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like watching the news at night,'' said Greg Smith, Grave
Line's director of undertakings. ``Instead of taking the news to
the people, we take the people to the news. We just kind of do it
in reverse _ to see where the real `Dead Man's Curve' was, or if
you go to England, to stand on the spot where Anne Boleyn lost her
head. To look around and think, `Ew, this is the last view she
had.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a student of Hollyweird history, founded Grave Line Tours
in October 1988. The service has since become one of the town's
most popular offbeat attractions, as well as a featured answer in
Trivial Pursuit and on Jeopardy!
</P>
<P>
   Smith plans to open similarly irreverent tours of Chicago and
Kansas City, Mo., this year, along with a crawl through New York
City's seedy underbelly in 1999 and London in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Grave Line draws locals and tourists alike. ``This goes back to
Shakespeare: `Tell sad stories about the death of kings,' '' said
Ardis Moe, an L.A. AIDS researcher taking the tour with her friend
Jim Menard, a wildlife official visiting from Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Each passenger receives a celebrity death certificate _ we opted
for ``probable suicide'' Marilyn Monroe _ along with annotated maps
of Westwood and Hollywood Memorial Parks and directions to sites
not on the tour route, such as Nicole Brown Simpson's former condo.
</P>
<P>
   We end up riding in a gray funeral car this day because the
hearse's brakes failed during the morning tour. ``This thing's a
death trap,'' Savage said before swapping it for the limousine.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of good brakes becomes apparent when Savage
wildly swerves and weaves the limo down Benedict Canyon, where
Richard Dreyfuss flipped his car while on drugs. He also drives
erratically, accompanied by the recorded sound of screeching tires
and breaking glass, as the limo rounds `Dead Man's Curve,' where
Jan Berry crashed his sports car in 1966, and again as we pass
Jayne Mansfield's palatial pink mansion. ``She lost her head.''

 &HT;    Portable sound systems gain respect
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Those of us who traipsed off to college those many
years ago toting a stereo-in-a-box remember the feeling:
inadequacy.
</P>
<P>
   Components spoke of seriousness about sound, of
blow-down-the-doors audio power and money. But portable stereos
that contained a tape deck, radio tuner and turntable that you
folded up and carried under an arm? That spoke of ... well, it
spoke of a limited budget.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, it was nice to have some kind of sound system, and it
did squeeze nicely into the back of the Chevy. But down the hall
was at least one dorm-mate whose stereo speakers had the heft of
the Chevy itself and whose amplifier was capable of lethal doses at
100 meters. Size might not be everything, but come on.
</P>
<P>
   Fold-'em-up stereos were always a discount alternative.
</P>
<P>
   And yet lately, the science of audio has nudged us closer to a
world in which convenient packaging can compete with components. We
have wireless phones that slip into your pocket, and we have
all-in-one stereo systems that claim to compete with the Big Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most aggressive makers has been Bose Corp., whose
marketing is built around the notion potent and accurate sound can
come roaring out of small speakers. A decade ago, Bose pioneered
``The Wave,'' a portable system the company dared to match against
component systems.
</P>
<P>
   Now Marantz America offers its own entry. The package, brags
Marantz, ``makes no apologies to conventional expectations of what
a stereo system should look like.'' The MR2020 is scheduled to be
in the stores this month at a suggested retail price of $1,000.
This system, boasts Marantz, ``establishes a dramatic new esthetic
in fully integrated music systems.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's pretty good for a portable.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, dial up the Marantz site on the Web
(http://www.marantzamerica.com) or call the company (708-307-2687).
</P>
<P>
   Can't keep it all
</P>
<P>
   Computers seemed at first like the answer to a pack rat's
prayer. Or a historian's.
</P>
<P>
   When you can't decide which sticky yellow notes to keep and
which ones to chuck, well, you understand. There's only so much
room, and some of that stuff really has to go.
</P>
<P>
   But when you have documents by the dozen in your computer, you
figure you can save them all -- or what's a digital memory for? It
may turn out that saving everything is neither easy nor cheap. And
maybe it's not right, either.
</P>
<P>
   Deanna B. Marcum, president of the Council on Library and
Information Resources, wrote recently that when you start talking
about millions of pages and files, the preservation of data for
years and decades is a huge financial investment. It not only fills
the hardware with bits and bytes, it commits the data to software
that might soon be obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The New York Times, Marcum said the real point is not
expense, anyway. Collections through history have been shaped by
the critical judgment of people who did more than just hit the
``save'' button, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Librarians and archivists know that a good collection, like a
good book, is made in the editing,'' Marcum writes.
</P>
<P>
   Fax by Net
</P>
<P>
   Makers of gadgets are increasingly looking for ways to use the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newest Net-friendly tools is the Panasonic KX-FP26OM,
a fax machine that includes a copier, speakerphone, printer and
scanner. According to Popular Mechanics magazine, the Panasonic
lets you send a fax anywhere via the Net, saving long-distance
phone charges.
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic says the machine will be available in September for
$279.95.
</P>
<P>
   For information, contact Panasonic (1-800-222-4213).
</P>
<P>
   How're we doin'?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike baseball, business doesn't always provide a scoreboard to
let you know how you are doing.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have benchmarks and goals, and if you can't measure
your progress as a business against where you have been and where
you want to be, then how do you really know where you are? Now, if
all this sounds somewhat New Age, then consider there is software
from various manufacturers that is aimed at letting businesses find
out if they are meeting expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the current offerings recommended by Windows Magazine in
its summer issue (http://www.winmag.com) is Business Plan Pro 2.0
from Palo Alto Software and Plan Write for Business 4.0 from
Business Resources Software.
</P>
<P>
   Business Plan Pro, which costs $100, provides a 16-step,
interactive guide that lets you check your numbers against your
original forecast. If you don't like what you see, you can also
concoct a new plan. For more information, call Palo Alto Software
(1-800-229-7526).
</P>
<P>
   Plan Write guides you through creation of business objectives,
product descriptions and customer profiles. It gives you charts for
break-even, cash flow and profit and loss. The software costs $130.
For more information, contact Business Resources Software by phone
(1-800-423-1228 or 512-251-7541).

 &HT;    Time for a day's break from all-intrusive technology
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I am here today to propose a new national holiday. I
don't think it'll be as much fun as Christmas, or as important as
Mother's Day, but I'm pretty sure it will catch on.
</P>
<P>
   I propose we have a National Low Tech Day. Instead of writing
e-mail to a friend, send them a letter or visit them. Balance your
checkbook by hand. Leave your cellular telephone at home. I'm
suggesting we start right now. Let's make today, the day you read
this column, the first annual observance.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my bet. Instead of finding that your day is more crowded,
you'll have some leisure time for a change. I know computers and
such-like are supposed to make our lives easier. But if computers
and technology continue to make things easier, I'm going to quit my
job and join the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the line I've lost my sweetly naive belief in
the supposition that all this high-tech stuff makes me more
productive and leaves me with more time for leisure. You'd think
I'd be in the catbird seat as far as reaping the benefits of
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Because of my job writing about technology, I have more
electronic and computer gear in my home than the average Navy
destroyer. And when I sit down at my desk at work, I stare at two
computers _ a top-of-the-line Macintosh G3 and a super-fast Pentium
II PC _ that sit close together like two buzzards after a good day
for road kill. At work I stay logged on to the Internet using a T1
line that offers a high-speed connection. I'm well connected at
home, too.
</P>
<P>
   I have computer programs to help me cook a meal, figure my
finances, select a wine, plan a wedding, sue a creditor, buy a
house, build a house, learn to oil paint, figure out why I'm so
neurotic, tell my fortune, discover a new career, do my horoscope,
create my family tree, build a deck and learn to play bridge.
</P>
<P>
   I have a dishwasher with more computer power than the original
Univac; my car has a computer, and so does the exercise bike that I
use, and my cat plays with computerized toys.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a new gadget hits the market, it's likely that the
manufacturer sends one to the newspaper for us to try. I spend more
on batteries than the average guy.
</P>
<P>
   But _ with all this computing power and gadgetry _ I have no
time at all. In fact, half the time my gadgets and computers
conspire to steal time from me. This morning, I spent an hour
trying to get the office's new e-mail program to work; last week my
car had to have a computer module replaced, so that meant a long
evening at the repair shop. We use a telephone system so
complicated that everyone here had to take a training class just to
be able to use it. I've seen grown men get quivery at the notion of
trying to use our copying machine.
</P>
<P>
   If the computer gurus here at the newspaper upgrade the word
processing system one more time, I'm pretty sure it'll stop working
altogether. And our new high-tech elevators went online here about
two months ago. The day after they went into service, I was trapped
in one for an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I'm ready to celebrate Low Tech Day. I think most of
us need a day when we escape from these electronic servants that
have _ somehow _ become our masters.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not advocating a return to the Dark Ages, but just a day
where we stop and think about how technology often uses us, instead
of us it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's time to celebrate. So get out your hammock and a good
paperback book. And plug yourself into a lazy day.

EVERYTHING WE DO HAS A RIPPLE EFFECT ON OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As I drove to work one recent morning, I had to brake to a full
stop in the center lane of the interstate highway I usually take. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I looked at my wife, with whom I carpool, and said, ``Unless
there's an accident up ahead (which there wasn't), I can't think of
one good reason for this. We're stopping as the result of a series
of bad driving decisions by people ahead of us.'' Which is when it
struck me anew that in a profound way all of our decisions _ good
and bad _ about every aspect of life inevitably have ripple effects
on others, effects we rarely consider. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What else, if not that, are we experiencing in the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal? As a result of some highly personal
decisions (whatever they were) made months and months ago by the
president and a White House intern, the government threatens to
shake itself apart, and it is no longer clear that Bill Clinton can
serve out his full second term. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, countless lives have been touched by this matter. And I
am not arguing that all of them have been affected for the worse.
After all, this tawdry affair has provided an enormous number of
billable hours for lawyers and employment for all kinds of
journalists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, often easy to see the massive effects of
public decisions made by world leaders. The atomic bombs Harry
Truman ordered dropped on Japan still create consequences today.
The evil actions produced by the malignant schemes in Adolf
Hitler's gnarled mind have changed the lives of millions of
families for eternity. Any fool can see those things. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what is less obvious are the smaller decisions individuals
make in private _ often without much thought for the consequences.
For instance, my daughters were born and reared in Kansas City as
at least an indirect result of my decision _ nearly three decades
ago _ to take a job here. Their lives are, of course, different in
unknown but myriad ways than they would have been had I elected to
continue living and working in Rochester, N.Y. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But even much smaller decisions can have unintended _ or at
least unforeseen _ consequences. Recently one of the computer users
in my house decided to change Web browsers, and tried to remove the
browser already on our machine. It was not, on its face, an
unreasonable decision. But removing it turned out to be a nearly
impossible task _ purposefully made so by Bill Gates' company _
that led to a cascade of problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, various people, including a friend I hired, spent
hours trying to salvage things, and Gates sold another software
program I hadn't intended to buy _ all to get things working
again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In still-smaller decisions we influence and change others'
lives, too. When we borrow scissors and don't return them we force
someone to waste time hunting for them. When we fail to set our
alarm clock and oversleep we inconvenience people who were counting
on us. When we snap at each other with caustic words we can cause
wounds that fester for months or years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our actions _ all of them _ have consequences. Not always are
these results important, of course. Often they get absorbed without
notice. But more often what we do changes things, though most of us
aren't good at imagining how ahead of time. And yet we must not
think we can always control what happens, even if we've taken care
to avoid unintended consequences. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winston Churchill had it right when he wrote: ``How little we
can foresee the consequences either of wise or unwise actions, of
virtue or of malice! Without this measureless and perpetual
uncertainty, the drama of human life would be destroyed.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, if we can be more considerate and refrain from actions
certain to affect others badly, that drama can have a happier
ending _ for everyone. &QL;

   CIA-CONTRAS (San Francisco) _ A study by the Justice
Department's inspector general affords a rare view of secret CIA
operations. And it poses a troubling question that may arise when
intelligence agencies intercede in prosecutions: Are they
protecting true national-security interests, or avoiding public
accountability? By SETH ROSENFELD.
</P>
<P>
   DROUGHT-TREES (Undated) _ The Texas Forest Service, which grows
and distributes pine seedlings for the state's private pine land
owners, said 1998 was a record year, with nearly 53,000 acres
planted in baby pines. But the dry hot summer of 1998 may claim up
to 90 percent of those trees. The crisis is threatening the
billion-dollar East Texas timber industry. By ALLAN TURNER.

   YIP-COLUMN (Houston) _ Chunks of wisdom and how you can use them
to manage your finances better. Personal finance experts offer bits
of time-tested money management advice. By PAMELA YIP
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-POWER (Houston) _ Computers are now more powerful than
most people need them to be. Unless you're into the latest and
greatest 3D computer games, you probably don't need a
top-of-the-line machine. Even former President Bush is taking
advantage of a cycle in PC technology in which low-cost hardware is
more than adequate for most computing tasks. By DWIGHT SILVERMAN.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   YADDO (Saratoga Springs, N.Y.) _ The legendary prose of ``The
Raven'' had roots on the grounds of what would become the writers'
colony called Yaddo. In the same densely wooded Saratoga landscape
where Edgar Allan Poe roamed 150 years ago, the secluded 400-acre
Yaddo estate is a sprawling terrain of blue stucco barns and
tranquil ponds, blossoming gardens, a pair of spooky graveyards and
a grand 55-room Victorian mansion. By THOMAS CHRISTIAN.
</P>
<P>
   KIDDIE-POOLS (Albany,, N.Y.) _ When temperatures soar, it's
great to be able to cool off. Especially in water. Don't worry if
you don't have a traditional swimming pool: Space permitting, try a
kiddie pool, or as it's more commonly called, a wading pool. By
FRANCES INGRAHAM.
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPING (Albany, N.Y.) _ In the mail from the American Dairy
Association we find sunburn remedies and other medicinal uses for
milk and milk products. Among them: _ To ease sun-reddened skin,
fill a quart jar with equal parts milk and ice and two
tablespoonfuls of salt. By STEVE BARNES.
</P>
<P>
   GROWNUP-GRAHAMS (Dallas) _ In a natural passing of the mantle in
a famous family evangelical family, Anne Graham Lotz Graham and
Franklin Graham, daughter and son of evangelist Billy Graham, talk
about their current projects, their views of women pastors and new
books they're working on. By CECILE HOLMES
</P>
<P>
   INCA-GOLD (Quito, Ecuador) _ Today we will fly over the Andes to
test new, ultra-refined, ground-penetrating radar, a device that
could revolutionize archaeology. For the scientists, the aim was to
prove the capabilities of the tool by flying over a region in the
Andes rumored to be the last bastion of Inca life. They hoped to
find evidence beneath the trees, or under the earth. By JANE
GANAHL.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Houston) _ A reader asks about the pregnant
onion, or ``Ornithogalum caudatum,'' a curious plant that also goes
by the common names false sea onion, German onion and healing
onion. The name pregnant onion is appropriate, since tiny bulbs
appear on the mother bulb. These small bulbs grow larger, then fall
to the soil's surface and become new plants. By KATHY HUBER
</P>
<P>
   RENAISSANCE (Slippery Rock, Pa.) _ Kristina Schroeder of
Niskayuna, N.Y., is one of 10,000 people who have gone back in time
_ say, about 500 years or so _ for the next few weeks. They're
attending a plague-free and slightly user-friendly version of the
Age of the Renaissance, less than an hour from Pittsburgh and a
world away from modern society. By ALAN WECHSLER
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TV-FELICITY-PROFILE (Undated) _ Everyone's talking about actress
Keri Russell. This fall, she'll star in ``Felicity,'' a one-hour
drama about the life of a recent high school graduate who scraps
her plans and impulsively decides to head to New York for college.
Critics are calling the show the next ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL (``t'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-COLUMN (Undated) _ The feisty French are squabbling about
food again. And the normally placid Brits are replaying the Battle
of the Sexes, this time in the name of _ gulp! _ travel writing. By
HARRY SHATTUCK
</P>
<P>
   DISNEY-SHIP (Port Canaveral, Fla.) _ After months of delays,
America's most celebrated mouse now roars as loudly at sea as on
land. Hop aboard Disney Magic for a preview of the world's newest
cruise ship, a family-oriented vessel that promises numerous
innovations. By SYD KEARNEY
</P>
<P>
   DISNEY-ISLAND (Undated) _ A short sidebar on Disney Cruise
Line's Castaway Cay, which was designed to fulfill the traveler's
dream of paradise: towering palm trees, acres of white-sand beaches
and incandescent blue water. By SYD KEARNEY
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FBN-SIMMS (New York) _ Game days were the worst. Although he
took his last snap with the New York Giants in 1993, for Phil Simms
the urge lingered every time he entered a stadium in his new career
as an NBC broadcaster. He wanted to be out there throwing passes,
running the two-minute drill, even handing off. He's getting over
it now. By PETE DOUGHERTY.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The iMac is, to put it
technically, really cool. Take it from a guy who doesn't know VRAM
from CD-ROMs, only recently thought a search engine was something
used by the Coast Guard, and uses his 11-year-old Mac SE as a
typewriter. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   MATTHEWS-COLUMN (Washington) _ By the time you read this column,
my wife and I will be in France on a one-week vacation. But I'm
confident that the Monica Lewinsky story will still be there when I
get back. By CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Unlike so many letters I
receive, Sharon Hodge's hand-written, eight-pager asked for
nothing. Not money. Not pity. Not a public forum. But I'm giving
Hodge a forum, anyway. She deserves it. And all of you in thrall to
Wall Street, you who think this is the best economy in a
generation, you need to hear a voice from the other America. By
STEPHANIE SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   CLACK-COLUMN (San Antonio) _ Clarence Thomas is right. He's also
a hypocrite. Just recently, the most controversial U.S. Supreme
Court justice spoke at the national convention of the National Bar
Association, the largest organization of black lawyers in the
nation. If they don't like him, it's not because of the color of
his skin but the content of his convictions. By CARY CLACK.
</P>
<P>
   TRAIN-TRAVEL (San Francisco) _ There is an alternative to
pollution-billowing air travel: Go back to trains. New-generation
trains run about as fast as planes, pollute very little and are far
more comfortable. Europe already is making the change to high-speed
rail to beat the airplane air pollution. By HUEY JOHNSON.
</P>
<P>
   ROBISON-COLUMN (Austin, Texas) _ The decision-makers at Gtech
Corp. thought they could make a profit operating Texas' Lone Star
Card. The gamble failed and now the company wants to sell its
operation to Citicorp Services. What happened? And why is the
Justice Department trying to block the proposed sale. By CLAY
ROBISON.

 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Hollywood has treated its sex symbols with a mixture of pride
and prejudice. The history of the women who supply the glamour to a
glamour industry is for the most part a sad one.
 &HT;    For many, the more the flashlights popped, the more lines of
print their lives occupied, the less happiness seemed to come their
way. Rita Hayworth was the perfect screen goddess but she could
never quite cope with the adulation that came from her looks,
especially since the real woman behind the facade couldn't ever
measure up.
 &HT;    Marilyn Monroe, who parlayed pinups and calendars into the kind
of stardom even she probably never dreamed of, is now celebrated _
again and again in books and movies _ as a feminist icon. But at
the height of her success she was confused and abused and never
managed to surmount her miserable childhood.
 &HT;    Voluptuary Jayne Mansfield met an untimely end (in a car crash
in l967) before she could prove to anyone that she was anything
more than a superstructure.
 &HT;    Not all sex symbols however have crashed and burned: Raquel
Welch has worn well and is about to remarry at 57. Joan Collins
parlayed her over the top diva image into Our Lady of Perpetual
Glamor. Sharon Stone and Demi Moore are earning up to $12 million a
picture. Stone is happily married to a newspaper editor from San
Francisco while Moore's marriage to Bruce Willis has just bottomed
out.
 &HT;    The jury is still out on Bo Derek. In the l979 movie ``10'' she
became the world's perfect woman, and an instant corn-rowed sex
symbol. As Dudley Moore's fantasy, she ignited the sexual desires
of millions of men around the world.
 &HT;    Today Bo is all of 41 years old and while men at that age can
continue to be box office icons, her sex symbol movie career is
virtually over. However, in October she's coming back _ to the
small screen. Still able to slip easily into a bikini, in ``Wind on
Water,'' a steamy new series on NBC, she's playing a beautiful
widow with two teenage sons, a strong woman battling to keep her
Hawaiian ranch. It's a kind of ``Dallas'' meets ``Bonanza'' via
``Baywatch.''
 &HT;    Two decades ago while Derek had the world at her feet, her life
was hardly her own. Her world and everything in it belonged to her
Svengali _ her domineering director-husband John Derek.
 &HT;    Bo was in her teens when Derek 30 years her senior, who had made
an art of growing sex symbols and marrying them, spotted her and
recreated her to his own blueprint. From then on Derek called the
shots. But in May of this year after a 24-year marriage Derek died
of heart failure, leaving Bo with a huge hole in her life.
 &HT;    She is still a sexy lady, her skin apparently untouched by her
years in the California sun. Wearing tiny granny sunglasses to lend
maturity, her figure is exercise-trim in a gray silk pants suit
over a black blouse, her hair still California beach baby blonde.
She's still Bo, the 10, just a tiny bit older. But the strings are
still visible even though the puppeteer has disappeared.
 &HT;    ``We were together since I was l7,'' she explains seriously,
``and that was my adult life. Now he's gone it hasn't really hit me
yet. It's all very strange.''
 &HT;    Derek had spent his lifetime molding women to fit his preferred
image. A former actor, he did it with Ursula Andress, wife No. 2.
He then photographed Linda Evans, his third wife for sexy magazines
and gained control over Bo when she was little more than a child.
 &HT;    She was a typical California surfer kid named Mary Kathleen
Collins from Long Beach, when Derek first set eyes on her on the
set of an erotic film he was making in Greece. Her mother had come
along as chaperone. Derek called her The Kid because he said he
didn't like her name.
 &HT;    For the Kid, finding her own life distinct from the man who ran
the only one she's known for almost a quarter of a century is a
tough order.
 &HT;    ``It was a matter of either going back to work or jumping off a
cliff,'' says Bo, who still makes her home on the sprawling horse
ranch she shared with her husband in the Santa Ynez Valley, 150
miles north of Los Angeles in the rolling Santa Barbara hills _ far
from the influences of Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``It's an absolute blessing that I have to go to Hawaii to do
the series, '' she admits. ``They are going to tell me when to get
up, where to go and what to say and do. That's important to me
right now. I'm not good at making decisions.''
 &HT;    Ironically, she says before he died Derek tried to talk her out
of doing the show.
 &HT;    ``He shuddered at the idea of me taking the role. Coming back to
Hollywood playing a mother to two adults was not his idea of the
woman he was in love with. He always saw me as The Kid. He couldn't
figure out that I'd grown up. But I felt this was the right thing
to do. I took control of my own career. And that makes it easier
for me to live with now.''
 &HT;    While the evidence of it is all around, not least in everything
she says, she still denies that Derek orchestrated her every move.
 &HT;    ``He was a rebel and he wanted things the way he wanted them.
But we both danced to our own drummer. And we fought battles with
Hollywood. Some we lost, some we won. But it enabled me to sleep
well at night. But then I took my own life in my own hands. I'm not
l7 anymore. ''
 &HT;    Hollywood believed Derek was using his young wife, exploiting
her immaturity to stroke his own ego _ and boost his bank balance.
But Bo says it was never that big a deal.
 &HT;    ``I never took my screen image very seriously,'' she says.
``Blake Edwards (director of ``lO'') was responsible for it. Not me
... although I got a lot of credit for it. Even John got credit for
it, or the blame and he had nothing to do with it,'' she laughs.
 &HT;    The most she and Derek are guilty of, she points out, was going
with the momentum Edwards had started. ``I never made an effort to
change that image. I really didn't. I wasn't out to prove anything.
It was a blessing in my life and made my life an absolute fairy
tale. After '10' I could pretty much do anything I wanted in the
business. So it was my fault if I didn't go to another level. I was
responsible.''
 &HT;    But how does the dancer dance when the dance master is no more?
The new series, she says, will be her life line. ``Wind on Water''
has given her a new family structure.
 &HT;    ``I feel it came at the right time and place in my life. I
believe in the show but it's not about me. It's much bigger than
me. It's about the young people on the show, their problems, their
experiences. I'm just the mom. Mind you I'm never going to be the
sit on the porch kind of mom. ''

CONVICTIONS, NOT COLOR, MAKE JUSTICE THOMAS A TARGET OF CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARY CLACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Clarence Thomas is right. Clarence Thomas is also
a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   Just recently, the most controversial of the U.S. Supreme Court
justices spoke at the national convention of the National Bar
Association, the largest organization of black lawyers in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is controversial because he's a black conservative, a
fact that has never sat well with many African Americans. And he's
not just any black conservative, but the highest-ranking African
American in government, who followed the legendary Thurgood
Marshall on the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' appearance marked the first time he had ventured into
the lion's den of his critics. To his credit, he accepted the
invitation to speak before the group and didn't back down when some
members of the Bar attempted to disinvite him. Courageously, he
didn't retreat from his convictions or tailor his words to pacify
his audience.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is right when he asks, ``Isn't it time to move on? To be
angry with me solves no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right when he asserts his right to think for himself and to
hold views that may not be popular with many, if not most, African
Americans. There is no black party line or monolithic black
mind-set. The range of views among African Americans is as varied
as skin tones.
</P>
<P>
   To accuse him of being the intellectual puppet of Justice
Antonin Scalia and other white conservatives on the court is to
deny him his independence. If Scalia and other justices aren't
criticized for their opinions because they're white, Thomas should
not be vilified for his because he's black.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is a hypocrite for his stance on affirmative action. He
alleges that such programs are based on black inferiority. This
from a man who got into Holy Cross College and Yale Law School on
affirmative-action programs. Which leads to a couple of questions
for white conservatives who oppose affirmative action: How do you
explain Clarence Thomas? And, isn't he an example of the good that
affirmative action can produce?
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is also a hypocrite if he believes that opposition to him
is based solely on race. If Thomas were white his comments and
legal opinions would still be worthy of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Before being appointed to the court, Thomas, in his eagerness to
impress his political patrons, made speeches belittling his sister
and using her as an example of a lazy welfare dependent. What he
failed to mention was that she was on welfare because she'd quit
work to care for their aunt who'd been incapacitated by a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   During his confirmation hearing, in an effort to display his
compassion, Thomas said that from his Circuit Court judge's office,
he could see handcuffed prisoners being led away from the federal
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas claimed to be moved by the sight. ``There but for the
grace of God go I,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But given the power of a Supreme Court justice, Thomas didn't
have the grace to vote with the majority in a 1992 case when he
wrote that a prisoner's constitutional rights weren't violated even
though the prisoner was shackled and beaten by two guards who split
his lip, broke his dental plate and loosened his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   There should be more gatherings where Thomas confronts his
critics and engages in vigorous but respectful dialogue. Thomas is
under no obligation to conform his thoughts to theirs. And his
critics aren't obligated to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't like him, it's not because of the color of his
skin but the content of his convictions.

CLEANER AIR MAY BE A WHISTLE-STOP AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HUEY JOHNSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An interesting phenomenon of this century has
been to observe various technologies hit the wall of limits. Air
travel is the one I see next as getting a dose of reality and
shrinking, or at least adjusting back.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier examples include nuclear energy, freeways and filling
the San Francisco Bay. Remember then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower
assuring the nation that this new gadget, nuclear energy, would
supply free electricity, that we wouldn't even use meters on our
buildings any more? Accidents like Three Mile Island and Chernobyl
could ``never happen,'' but they did. Deadly waste, bankrupt
utilities and citizen opposition buried the nuclear dream.
</P>
<P>
   Freeways were another example. San Francisco residents shut down
a half-built freeway and started a movement that ended the national
freeway juggernaut. And the movement to fill the San Francisco Bay
was stopped by the citizen-based Save the Bay Association.
</P>
<P>
   Why is air travel next to reach its limit? Because breathing
healthy air is a subject of interest to everyone. Air travel and
airports immediately catch my eye as huge sources of pollution that
have gotten little attention.
</P>
<P>
   We have a better alternative: Go back to trains. New-generation
trains run about as fast as planes, pollute very little and are far
more comfortable. Europe already is making the change to high-speed
rail to beat the airplane air pollution. A new-generation train
between Los Angeles and San Francisco _ or even better, Los Angeles
and Seattle _ would get rid of a huge belch of air pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   When the history of environmental recovery in the United States
is written, the San Francisco area will be remembered for the two
great citizen-based revolts _ stopping the freeway and stopping Bay
filling. In both, citizens rose up to correct a condition that was
out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   We will never get these trains unless we stop believing we can
fly jets and pollute forever in unlimited ways. We need to go back
to the barricades to make history for a third time.

 APPLE GOES BACK TO THE BASICS WITH iMAC  
 Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I scream, you scream, we all scream for iMac.
</P>
<P>
   This machine is, to put it technically, really cool. Take it
from a guy who doesn't know VRAM from CD-ROMs, only recently
thought a search engine was something used by the Coast Guard, and
uses his 11-year-old Mac SE as a typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   The other day I went down to Apple headquarters in Cupertino,
Calif., to test drive the company's new iMac, ``the Internet-age
computer for the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jobs' new feature-loaded $1,299 baby has been in
development for 11 very intense months, and it just may be the
computer which puts the shine back on the Apple image.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of us who pretend to loathe computers, but
secretly want to get on the Internet and find cool Web sites with
recipes or Monica Lewinsky jokes. We're just afraid of seeming
stupid, or filling our brains with gibberish like ``233-MHz PowerPC
G3 processor with 512k backside cache.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Boger, the iMac product line manager, wrote some words I did
understand on a blackboard: ``speed,'' ``style'' and
``simplicity.'' Then he left me alone in a room with a boxed iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, there was some stuff about MHz and and RISC printed
on top of the box, but once you open the box, it's a whole other
world of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Ah. Even if you slave at a computer terminal at work, and hate
the sight of the thing, you chuckle at the sight of this one.
</P>
<P>
   It's like the first time you saw R2D2 in ``Star Wars.'' The iMac
looks like a Gummi computer, made of semitransparent blue-green and
ice-white plastic formed into a pod that looks like a toy air-car
for one of the junior Jetsons.
</P>
<P>
   The polycarbonate plastic is supposedly the same material that
goes into bullet-proof glass, but even Elvis at his lowest point
wouldn't have the heart to shoot this creature.
</P>
<P>
   As huggable as it is (although not disgustingly huggable like a
Teletubby), it's an elegant and powerful delivery system to launch
people straight into the Internet. That's what the ``i'' in iMac
stands for _ Internet'' _ not ``I want one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: It took me an hour to get from opening the box to
surfing the Net and finding my own Web site, but half of that time
was spent waiting for Boger to come back and help me with the Apple
password to use their account.
</P>
<P>
   If I'd started my own account with Earthlink, I'd have been
surfing Matt Drudge's and Linda Tripp's Web sites in a half hour,
which sure beats the infinity it takes me to reset the clock on my
VCR.
</P>
<P>
   So what if I wasn't anywhere near as fast as the elementary
school kid in an Apple ad who goes from box to Web in nine minutes
flat.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I was entranced by the little instructional movie, with
a Princess Leia-like woman in dreamy motion explaining very simply
how to use the Web and e-mail features of the machine.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of other features to the iMac, besides the fact
that it turns techno-hodads into Net-surfers in a matter of
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Boger ran through all the goodies that come with the machine.
First of all, it's built around a 15-inch color monitor with such
clarity that you wish iMAC picked up 49er games _ one of the few
things it doesn't do.
</P>
<P>
   The machine is fast, as fast as home or school users need, and
there are stereo speakers, surround-sound, double headset jacks so
two kids can use them, and a very thin, very comfortable keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   There is built-in writing, art and spreadsheet software, a
Williams-Sonoma cooking CD-ROM with recipes and little movies
showing basic cooking techniques, and beautiful high-definition 3-D
video games. One involves dinosaurs running around more
realistically than their counterparts in ``Jurassic Park,'' except
that the hero dinosaur uses a laser blaster.
</P>
<P>
   Look, I may not know a Nanosaur from Quicken, but there's a lot
of stuff here. If iMac were a car, it would be described as loaded.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing it lacks is a floppy disc drive, but according to
Boger, it's old technology, so they left it out. You can store
files all kinds of other ways.
</P>
<P>
   You may notice the lack of technical lingo in this column, but
there's something about iMac that liberates you from the feeling
that you have to even try to use it. There's something almost human
about iMac. At the very least, you don't feel dehumanized sitting
in front of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the VW bug,'' Boger said. ``When people see it, they
smile and say, `Hey, it's iMac.'''
</P>
<P>
   Boger was clearly tired after 11 months of late night teamwork
creating iMac. It's hard work thinking different, as Apple puts it,
but this may be Apple at its different best.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fresh and interesting,'' Boger said. ``The computer
business was getting boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, I'm not qualified to say if iMac is technically
interesting, but if it ever becomes as obsolete as my old Mac SE,
at least it will look great sitting in the corner on a desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are already art museums that want it for their
collections, and it hasn't even been released yet,'' Boger said.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one down side to iMac that I could clearly
identify. I don't have one. I would have been willing to write out
a check for $1,299 plus tax right there at Apple headquarters, but
I'll have to get on a waiting list like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   But when I get mine, I may be able to go from box to Web in nine
minutes flat.

TREE GROWERS FACE WOES AS HEAT, FIRES TAKE TOLL IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: La. and Texas) 
 
By ALLAN TURNER  
 c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crimson, gold, tobacco brown. From the Red River to the Coastal
Plains, the forests of East Texas are aflame in a burst of autumnal
glory.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no change-of-seasons woodlands rhapsody. This is a
song of death.
</P>
<P>
   The region's 12 million acres of pine and hardwood forests are
in the grip of the worst drought in decades _ one that has combined
scant rainfall with weeks of searing 100-plus-degree temperatures.
Even when welcome rains pelted the area last week, experts worried
that much serious, irreversible damage has been done.
</P>
<P>
   Already, millions of loblolly pine seedlings have withered and
died. Countless mature trees have gone dormant as moisture in their
trunks reached critically low levels and others _ seemingly healthy
_ have been stunted by the heat. Roughly 75,500 acres of forest and
grassland have been charred in drought-fueled blazes in East and
East-Central Texas since May 1.
</P>
<P>
   It still is too early to assess financial costs of the disaster.
Some commercial operators won't scrutinize their timber lands until
October. But, everywhere one goes, said U.S. Forest Service
spokeswoman Gay Ippolito, ``it almost looks as if fall has begun.
... The leaves are turning, changing colors as the trees are in
different stages of dying.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis threatening the billion-dollar East Texas timber
industry has reduced some timbermen to impotent frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you're a good timber man and manager and without the
good Lord's help, you can't manage things at all,'' one lamented
last week.
</P>
<P>
   As raindrops skittered off the roof of the Forest Service's
Lufkin headquarters the other day, tree expert Ron Haugen glumly
noted: ``This is not a turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent rains, he said, realistically will give forests a five-
to seven-day break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would need rainfall like this every week or every other
week,'' he said. ``We really need a tropical storm _ 10 to 12
inches of rain in three or four days. If it goes back to 100
degrees and no rain, we'll be in the same old situation before you
know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Forest Service fire specialist Mahlon Hammetter said the
same holds for the recent rain's fire-retardant effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps for the short term,'' he said, ``but we need some
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Haugen described the East Texas forest fire potential as
``explosive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, 1998 started out as a pretty good year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got most of our rainfall in the spring,'' Temple-Inland
spokesman Tony Bennett said from company headquarters in Diboll.
``We aren't real behind in total rainfall. But very little of that
came in the summer. That, with heat, has led to the obvious
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Longview, heart of the Northeast Texas pine belt, received only
0.38 inch of rain in July, a month that also was characterized by
23 consecutive days of 100-degree temperatures. Average May-July
rainfall for the city normally is about 13 inches; this year, 2.4
inches have been recorded.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HEAVILY FORESTED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the heavily forested tier of counties bordering Louisiana
north of Beaumont _ a region where rainfall annually exceeds 50
inches _ there is a 10- to 12-inch rainfall deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see this more than every 30 or 40 or 50 years,''
said Roger Erickson, coordinating meteorologist with the National
Weather Service in Lake Charles, La. ``It is very unusual for it to
be this dry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Trees contain an awful lot of moisture,'' said the Forest
Services's Haugen, ``normally about 100 percent by weight.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, he said, moisture levels have dropped to 40 percent,
a point at which trees have become dormant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tree self-defense mechanism,'' he said. ``They just
shut down the respiration process of releasing water through the
leaves. You have brown leaves all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   While an early dormant phase doesn't necessarily mean a tree
will die, it does the plant no good. Haugen worried that tree loss
might be extensive should next summer also be hot and dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day of heat and drought matters,'' said Brad Barber, a
forest resource development expert with the Texas Forest Service in
College Station.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ways the state forest service aids private land
owners is by providing pine seedlings at nominal cost for
reforestation. The trees, only 6 to 12 inches tall when planted,
take about 25 years to reach a commercially usable size.
</P>
<P>
   ``We administered plantings on a record number of acres this
year,'' Barber said. ``We had about 53,000 acres. But it's been
pretty grim. We don't know for sure yet, but it may be turning out
to be our worst survival year.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LOSS OF SEEDLINGS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, it has been typical to lose roughly a third of
all newly planted seedlings. This year, Barber estimated, close to
90 percent might be lost. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I've talked to foresters who have been in the field,'' he
said, ``and they have even seen pines planted the previous year,
second-year plantings, starting to die. That's fairly uncommon.''
</P>
<P>
   While the seedlings themselves usually cost pennies apiece _
typically, 700 trees are planted per acre _ the cost of preparing
the land for replanting can reach $150 an acre, making the
proposition of replanting a costly one, Barber said.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy F. Thompson, president of the 73-member Cass County Forest
Owners Association based in Linden, reported a similar plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``My observation,'' he said, ``is that it's almost a complete
loss on newly planted seedlings. They have a very short root system
and, in that first year, adequate water is very, very critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple-Inland's Bennett said that of the 30,000 acres his
company planted in seedlings, 6,000 acres will need to be
replanted.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond seedling loss, the drought may reduce the growth of
mature trees by 25 percent, timber experts said.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Jerry Graves, owner of a Longview area Christmas tree farm,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger trees that are surviving, they look real good,'' he
said. ``But they're not growing. What should have been an 8-foot
tree is going to be 6 or 6{ feet.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the extent of his good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost everything I planted this year,'' he said, ``and at
least a third of the trees I planted last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves began his farm in 1978. His first drought experience came
two years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to water that year. I was out watering by hand with a
garden hose,'' he recalled. ``It didn't do me any good. I didn't
even try that this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm losing trees every day.''

MAKING THE MOST OF EXPERT ADVICE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In my years of writing about personal finance, certain bits of
time-tested money management advice pop up over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   It pays to review these chunks of wisdom and how you can use
them to manage your finances better. Here are some of my favorites
gleaned from conversations with personal finance experts and from a
collection of business and economics quotations:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Don't let the tax tail wag the investment dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Make your investments in the context of your overall financial
picture, not just the tax implications of your decision.
</P>
<P>
   For example, given the stock market's recent falls, some of you
may want to cash out of your riskier investments into ones that
would enable you to sleep better at night.
</P>
<P>
   If a stock you own has had hefty gains since you bought it but
now has poor prospects, don't be afraid to dump it. Yes, you'll
have to pay tax on the gain, but getting out of it will save you
more money in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Cut your losses and let your profits run.''
</P>
<P>
   A major mistake that many investors make is getting so
emotionally involved with a stock that they lose all common sense
when the stock is going down the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be in denial and hold on to a stock when it's clear that
it's heading nowhere. Take your profits and get out.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Riches come rather from management than from revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   In my dealings with financial planners, many have told me that
they have seen people who make oodles of money, yet have very
little in the bank because they spend it all.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, it's not how much you make, but how much you keep.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Our incomes are like our shoes; if too small, they gall and
pinch us, but if too large, they cause us to stumble and to trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger our income, the harder it is to live within it
because supply creates its own demand.
</P>
<P>
   How many times have you gotten a raise or come into some other
financial windfall and salivated over what you could buy with that
extra money? The amount of goods and services we want has a funny
way of increasing in proportion to our ability to afford them _ and
regrettably sometimes to our inability to afford them.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Don't gamble. Take all your savings and buy some good stock
and hold it until it goes up, then sell it. If it doesn't go up,
don't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market itself is a big gamble. There's no scientific
law that says a stock that falls will go back up.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing, the whole idea of good investing is coming in at
the right time before a stock goes up so far that it's hit a
plateau and you're buying in too late.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs get
slaughtered.''
</P>
<P>
   There are only two emotions that count on Wall Street: fear and
greed.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of missing out on the action can make you snap up a stock
when its heyday has gone. Fear also can make you bail out of a
falling stock without rationally analyzing the prospects of the
issuing company and whether the stock's decline reflects investors'
skepticism of the firm or of the market as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Greed can make you gather up all your profits from a stock and
still not sell all of your shares because you believe maybe there's
just one more runup left in the stock. More often than not, the
stock tanks.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``People do not grow rich by keeping their money unused. They
must be willing to spend in order to gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone who keeps money under the mattress will lose in the
battle against inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In order to keep ahead of inflation, you need to put your money
in the best inflation-fighting tool _ stocks. However, you must be
willing to spend some money to invest in order to reap that gain.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high
plateau.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is permanent on Wall Street, especially peaks.
</P>
<P>
   When stock prices reach what investors think is too high a
level, they start to worry about a crash.
</P>
<P>
   That's what we're seeing today. Analysts are questioning whether
we're seeing a fundamental shift in mood among investors.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The safest way to double your money is to fold it over once
and put it in your pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with that is you're still left with the same single
dollar bill. You really haven't gained anything, and with
inflation, you could actually lose half the buying power of that
dollar bill.
</P>
<P>
   Hiding your money in your pocket or under your mattress isn't
going to help you double your money. You've got to be able to risk
some in investments and put your money to work for you.

LIVING ON THE EDGE OF THE `BOOM' ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Unlike so many letters I receive, Sharon Hodge's
hand-written, eight-pager asked for nothing. Not money. Not pity.
Not a public forum.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm giving Hodge a forum, anyway. She deserves it. And all
of you in thrall to Wall Street, you who think this is the best
economy in a generation, you need to hear a voice from the other
America.
</P>
<P>
   Hodge and her husband James live in Bellflower, Calif. She wrote
after reading a column of mine about a group of rich folks who are
aware and ashamed of the gross imbalance in our economy and want to
do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Cuts have been made for space but, except for minor style
changes, this is Sharon Hodge's letter:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are like many struggling people out there. My husband and I
were hit more than once, and you get to a point when you just feel
hopeless and give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been married almost 36 years, bought one first-and-only
home years ago that was to be our retirement security. It was an
old home, small, two-bedroom, one-bath and needed much work. But
raising two children came first so our plans were to repair and
remodel when our kids went out on their own. We both worked
full-time and refinanced to take care of much-needed repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little did we know. After we completed our home, the company
my husband worked for went out of business, and shortly after that,
I became ill and lost my job. We lost our home because no one
wanted to hire a hard-working man in his early 50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband was out of work over two years, and we struggled to
pay rent when we had to walk away from our home. Finally, my
husband found a job making $8 an hour but plenty of overtime. With
that, my artwork and a small retirement check of $275 per month
from my former job, we were struggling to get back on our feet and
plan for our retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight dollars an hour isn't much to work with but the overtime
was God-sent and our hope for our future. Then Gov. (Pete) Wilson
came along and wiped out daily overtime, stating companies would
not abuse the new law. Wrong! As soon as the new law went into
effect, not only did the company my husband works for stop all
overtime, they cut hours, making sure no employee got 40 hours for
fear of the possibility of overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to cancel plans for saving and once again we are going
to lose our rental home because we can't survive on less than 40
hours a week at $8 an hour ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the middle class and wealthy can survive in this country.
The government claims we should be responsible for our own
retirement. How, when someone is always in your pocket? We should
be responsible to train for new jobs. Why, when my husband was
jobless for over two years because he was `too old'?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proud, hard-working people who could only afford two
vacations in 35 years; the last one was in 1985 ... We have to
decide between eating less or paying an overdue utility bill. We
can't even afford to buy a computer to catch up with the world. We
both drive old cars; even hobbies cost money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we think about people who have less than we do, children
going hungry ... We send $20 a month (to a fund for needy children
in Appalachia) even though it's hard, but we can do without
something to help feed children.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wonder there's so much stress, anger, hopelessness and
suicide in this world ... Greed is destroying this country, and
people don't care about people anymore. No wonder people don't care
to vote anymore, don't care to get involved and see no light at the
end of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I will be married 36 years this November, and
the love we share for each other has been the only thing that has
gotten us through so much heartache. We had to sell everything we
owned and accumulated over 35 years to pay for a place to live when
we lost our home. Now we're on the edge of probably having to move
again, finding some small place to live, giving up our yard and
nice area where we feel safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wonder our youth is so troubled and lacks respect. They see
the greed, downsizing, companies moving to other countries because
of the all-mighty dollar, parents struggling and needing two
incomes to survive, leaving children without a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too late for us. We're in our 50s and our goals and
dreams were shattered, but we need to save our children, our
grandchildren. Even athletes have priced us out of taking our
9-year-old grandson to a ballgame. We can't afford the price of a
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel sorry for myself. I just see others hurting. I
see my husband with high blood pressure, losing his dignity and
worrying about me and our future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the answer is or if there is one. I hurt for
so many. We're used to doing without and, at our age, no one cares
anyway, but many do need someone to care. Our country is falling
apart and being destroyed ... Our children are hurting, towns are
hurting, the elderly are hurting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't anyone see what's happening, or does anyone care as long
they keep building their financial wealth? Do they think their
money will buy their way to Heaven?''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, I spoke at length with Sharon Hodge and learned a
lot more about her. She and James, a truck driver, live from
paycheck to paycheck but haven't lost their rental home. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days you almost want to feel sorry for yourself,'' she
said. ``But then you've got to sort of slap yourself in the face.
You have to believe something will come along.''

PREGNANT ONIONS CRAVE SUNLIGHT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Sarasota, Fla.) 
 
By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: A friend gave me a pregnant onion. Will you give me
some information on this plant?
</P>
<P>
   A: The pregnant onion (``Ornithogalum caudatum'') is a curious
plant that also goes by the common names false sea onion, German
onion and healing onion. The name pregnant onion is appropriate,
since tiny bulbs appear on the mother bulb. These small bulbs grow
larger, then fall to the soil's surface and become new plants.
</P>
<P>
   The pregnant onion likes sun or partial sun. Do not overwater.
The mother bulb is planted with most of its girth above the soil
line. I'm guessing yours is in a container, as these are often
grown as pot plants. A potting soil amended with a little composted
manure and sharp sand is an ideal growing medium. You can plant
pregnant onion in the garden in a protected area, in an enriched,
well-draining soil. A little sand under the bulb will help. Mulch
well in cold weather. Again, plant with the top half of the bulb
above the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Long, straplike leaves will grow from the bulb. The numerous,
half-inch white blooms appear on long stems in spring or summer.
When the mom has finished flowering, hold off on the water for a
while and let her rest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On trips to Bermuda and Florida I have seen fascinating
banyan trees. I obtained some seeds from the Sarasota, Fla., area
and would love to grow a banyan tree here. I don't recall seeing
any in Texas and would like to know if they can do well in the
Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   A: I have seen the curious banyans in the Sarasota area, too,
but, like you, have never seen them here, only relatives in the
genus Ficus. The banyan tree, ``Ficus benghalensis,'' is also
called East Indian fig tree, and it is remarkable in that it
produces aerial roots from the branches. These aerial roots grow
toward the ground, then root and become trunks. The banyan is a
fast grower, and, as additional trunks are developed, the tree can
have a crown that spreads 100 yards in diameter. You can see why it
would be valued as a shade tree.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here would be protecting it from freezing weather.
It prefers a more truly tropical climate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a plant _ and its seeds _ sent to me from
Pennsylvania. It was classified as a hosta. It disperses large
quantities of seeds after blooming, dies in the fall, but returns
in the spring. My plant is doing well but has not bloomed yet. The
seeds that I planted last year have sprouted but have remained
small, only about 3 inches in height. I'm wondering if this is
something other than a hosta, since none of mine throw seeds.
</P>
<P>
   A: The leaf you sent looks like that from a hosta. And what
you've described is typical of hostas. These perennials do
disappear in the fall and return in spring.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, various hostas have been tested in our area to find
those that do best in our climate. Certain hybrids have proven to
be more vigorous than others, but many hostas take their time in
gaining any size, so 3-inch seedlings don't surprise me. Some of
those I'm testing have flowered sooner than others. Yours may have
needed a longer adjustment period, or it may be one that typically
flowers later in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The original hostas in your garden may be hybrids that aren't
big seed producers, or they could be sterile and produce no seed.
</P>
<P>
   We have a shady back garden, so I'm constantly looking for
plants with striking foliage as well as those with colorful
flowers. Hostas have traditionally been grown for their bold or
textural leaves, but lately more attention is being directed at
those with better flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The key to growing any hosta here is a fertile, well-draining
soil; an hour or two of morning sun followed by bright shade or a
day in bright shade; and sufficient moisture to encourage good
growth. However, the most surprising thing about the established
hostas in our garden is their ability to even survive in this
drought. I water them, but they have not required watering as
frequently as some other plants. And varieties such as `Francee'
don't look that bedraggled by the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I purchased red canna bulbs last summer and planted them in
the fall. Nothing came up, and the company replaced them this
summer. I don't know whether to plant them or not. I placed the
bulbs in a clean plastic bag and put them in the refrigerator
vegetable bin. Can I plant them now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Cannas are extremely popular these days. Tropicals are a
growing gardening trend, even up North.
</P>
<P>
   Canna rhizomes do not need to be refrigerated. I would remove
them (you don't want them to rot), check to make sure they are in
good condition and plant them now in a moist but well-draining soil
that you've enriched with compost.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Do not store bulbs in refrigerator bins with fruits and
vegetables, as the ethylene gas produced by these foods can destroy
the bulbs' ability to flower.
</P>

FAMOUS PREACHER'S CHILDREN BLAZING THEIR OWN TRAILS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CECILE S. HOLMES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The heir to Billy Graham's evangelical mantle ducked
his head, tugging on his baseball cap as his older sister confessed
her difficulties remembering her busy speaking schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to remember where the last place was I spoke,''
said Anne Graham Lotz. ``You know I'm taking those herbs that are
supposed to help with your memory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've already turned 50, right?'' William Franklin Graham
III, her younger sibling, said, eyes twinkling. ``Ought to try a
Diet Coke. That's what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   His almost-as-famous sister ignored him. ``Let's see now: Labor
Day weekend I'm doing Cross Seekers in New Orleans. I'll have
15,000 college kids for that. Then I have three weekends at the
Billy Graham Training Center in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Like her brother, Lotz is a respected Christian author, teacher
and public speaker with her own outreach project, AnGel Ministries.
Friends talk about her common sense and sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Like his sister, Graham is winning accolades for offering the
Gospel in a way that reaches his own generation.
</P>
<P>
   Both promoted their new books during a recent Christian
Booksellers Association meeting in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Lotz's new book, ``God's Story: Finding Meaning For Your Life In
Genesis'' (Word, $17.99) helps average believers approach the
Christian Bible's first book as ``God's eyewitness account of
Creation.'' Written with a personal, poetic style, the volume takes
readers inside Lotz's head and heart. Her writing reveals a
searching soul with an intense, passionate faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flashing-red-light warning for you and me is to beware
getting so caught up in the way everyone around us is living that
we get swept away by the current of wickedness and waste our own
lives in a meaningless existence,'' she writes. ``In the midst of
spiritual dwarfs, we must strive to be giants.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes prayer and self-discipline to keep that goal in sight,
say Lotz and Graham. She talked about the importance of daily
private devotions; he stressed conveying God's word in preaching
and outreach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think preaching is something God honors and something he
blesses,'' Graham said. ``We're using his Word. It's not my word. I
think people are tired of the overweight preacher in a three-piece
suit with slick hair and rings on his fingers and kind of talking
down to them. I don't want to do that. I want to try to relate on
their level.''
</P>
<P>
   At 45, Graham operates his own emergency relief agency,
Samaritan's Purse. Headquartered in Boone, N.C., it has an annual
budget of nearly $50 million and provides assistance in Africa,
Asia, Eastern Europe and other areas of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Graham writes about others' faith and his own in his new book,
``Living Beyond the Limits'' (Thomas Nelson, $19.99.) His faith has
taken him into danger-filled, war-torn regions where he has met
people determined to serve God by helping others.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation metaphors run through the volume. ``I love to fly
airplanes,'' he confesses, ``especially the Mitsubishi MU2. The MU2
is known in the aviation industry as `the rice rocket.' It will get
me where I need to go really quick. In the Christian life, just
like in a plane, you need a good take-off _ salvation in Jesus
Christ. But just as important, you want to be able to fly safely,
navigate around the storms, and eventually land at the ultimate
destination without crashing.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Graham family and friends, Franklin's exploits as a child
and adolescent were famous. He is the fourth of Billy and Ruth Bell
Graham's five children. In his youth, he loved fast cars, his
beat-up pickup, dirt bikes and pranks that drove his mother and
sisters crazy.
</P>
<P>
   The devilish youngster so taxed his mother that once, in
exasperation, she shut him in the trunk of the family's car en
route to a fast-food restaurant after he wouldn't quit pinching his
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Franklin would agree, my mother raised five of us
pretty much without Daddy,'' Lotz recalled. ``I had somebody
actually say to me that they knew Daddy had preached all over the
world but they never thought about that he had to leave home to do
it. So we were in one sense raised by a single parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Today all five Graham offpspring are grown with children. All
are Christians involved in outreach. Gigi Graham Tchividjian, the
oldest, who lives in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., is an author and
speaker. Ruth McIntyre, the third daughter who wrote a Bible
storybook for children, is a teacher and speaker. She lives in
Virginia, and works for Samaritan's Purse. Ned Graham, the
youngest, who lives in Seattle, heads East Gates Ministries
International, which has distributed 2 million copies of Scriptures
in China.
</P>
<P>
   Lotz says her own determination to keep seeking God even when he
seemed faraway springs from her mother's stalwart faith and her
father's devoted evangelizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a girl, I loved the Lord and I loved his Word. When I
drifted from him, I looked back and I could see my mother raising
the five of us without a husband present in the home everyday. And
I never saw her lose her temper, just completely come unglued. And
after being with Franklin all day, you could have had the tendency
to lose your temper!''
</P>
<P>
   In his 20s, her younger brother says, he turned to Christ after
meeting energetic people ``living exhilarating lives without the
shallowness that plagued my own.'' He began serving on the board of
his father's ministry in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association _
which organizes the crusades led by him and his father _ elected
the younger Graham as its first vice-chairman. That puts him in
line to succeed his father as the association's chairman and CEO.
He is expected to take the reins of an evangelical empire with an
operating budget of $91 million. Gradually, the elder Graham, 79,
who has Parkinson's disease, is passing responsibilities to his
son.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Graham still does several crusades annually, with an
upcoming one in Tampa, Fla. Franklin Graham leads six-10 crusades
each year, speaking in 1998 in Louisiana, Virginia, New Mexico,
North Carolina, and in Australia and Peru.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While he still insists no one will ever fill Billy Graham's
shoes, Graham's strength as a preacher is growing. In evangelical
and celebrity circles, he cuts a higher and higher profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a little different type style,'' he says. ``I give the
invitation (altar call in his father's day) at the beginning and
the end of the meeting, hoping people will understand what I'm
really trying to do. We use music a lot, but then, so did my
father. He came out of the big band era.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, married with four children, travels like his dad did,
but is rarely gone more than two weeks at a time. He tries to keep
his work and family separated.
</P>
<P>
   He likes to preach, but admits he'll never lose his love of the
hands-on relief ministry of Samaritan's Purse. Its outreach
includes the now-famous Operation Christmas Child. In that project,
American children and parents prepare shoeboxes of Christmas gifts
and necessities that Samaritan's Purse airlifts to needy kids
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's outreach in countries such as Bosnia amazes Lotz, who
notes that he ``goes to places nobody else goes to around the
world.'' Her brother praises his sister's work, complimenting her
dedication and wide following.
</P>
<P>
   When the two were part of an interfaith meeting of religious
leaders with President Clinton several years ago, it was Lotz, not
Graham, who was most eloquent, Graham said. After she challenged
U.S. leaders, including Clinton, to admit the nation needs a
spiritual anchor and to follow God and the Ten Commandments, people
came up and said, ``Franklin, you have some kind of sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotz, soft-voiced and naturally shy, says it took her years to
learn to speak before crowds. Married to a dentist in Raleigh,
N.C., she has three grown children. Her move into public life began
with Bible Study Fellowship, a Scripture class she started in 1976.
Her first weekly class attracted hundreds of women. She never
missed teaching a class for 12 years. Today, Bible Study
Fellowship, headquartered in San Antonio, is worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   As their parents age and their contemporaries return to church,
both Graham and Lotz are carving niches suited to their gifts. Each
has star qualities. Graham's thick shock of hair and piercing eyes
are reminiscent of his dad's good looks. Lotz, whose style is
gentle and authoritative at the same time, has the contagious smile
and tanned, long-legged beauty of her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the individualistic Graham children, they agree on
many issues. But they explore, teach and preach about them in
different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Graham possesses the fiery preaching style of his father's early
years, stressing that turning to Jesus is the only way to achieve
salvation. In sermons, he is critical of errant lifestyles,
including homosexuality and declining family values. But his
outlook on women in ministry is open-minded. So is his sister's.
She attended a Southern Baptist congregation in Raleigh, N.C.; he
goes to the Mount Vernon Baptist Church in Boone.
</P>
<P>
   Lotz is comfortable preaching, but believes God has
``forbidden'' her to be ordained and calls her to a different kind
of ministry. ``I have really some wonderful friends. One of the
women who was a mentor to me was an ordained woman in a
congregation in California. If other women feel God is leading them
to that, I respect what God is leading them to. I don't think the
Scripture is black and white on that.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Graham says he has no objections to women in ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think there are problems that come up in a church that
probably a man needs to handle. There's a lot of politics that goes
on in churches. Sometimes you just need somebody who can be
half-mean, who can be real tough,'' Graham said, noting that
doesn't mean women are too gentle-spirited to preach or pastor. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Growing up a Graham wasn't always easy, but being the offspring
of the world's most famous, most traveled evangelist made it
interesting. Growing up in the western North Carolina mountain town
of Montreat, they endured some of the trials peculiar to the
offspring of the famous. Franklin rebelled. Anne married young, had
three kids and felt distanced from the certain faith of her
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Both credit the common sense, sound judgment and good parenting
of their mother, Ruth Bell Graham, for imparting to them the faith
and values they hold so dear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew she drew her strength from spending time in God's
word,'' Lotz said. ``She had a big flat-top desk with 14 different
translations of the Bible laid out. If she had any time during the
day, she was back there reading her Bible. At night, I would slip
down to her room and find her on her knees in prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Often she asked for help with her kids, the siblings say.
Watching them spar verbally, it is easy to imagine rearing five was
a task worthy of a drill sergeant and saint.
</P>
<P>
   Did Graham and Lotz always get along so well?
</P>
<P>
   Lotz is sweet, even laudatory: ``I've always loved Franklin. He
goes into areas of the world others won't touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Didn't they ever fight? Lotz demurs, and Graham grins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to get beat up,'' says Billy Graham's successor.
``Remember, she's older than I am.''

 &HT;    ShortTakes: Spielberg's Normandy
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Steven Spielberg's account of D-Day,
richly deserves the box office and praise it is receiving.
``Private Ryan'' is three movies. The first is a searing depiction
of Omaha Beach. The second, the finding of Pvt. Ryan, is long and
in search of a larger theme. The third is a fight for a French
village, every battle scene you've ever seen done better. Omaha
Beach carries the rest to greatness.
</P>
<P>
   The middle film deserves a weightier theme. For such a theme,
find a tape, if there is one, of Stanley Kubrick's 1957 ``Paths of
Glory,'' starring Kirk Douglas, a seldom-discussed movie that may
be the best war film ever made. The film concerns the World War I
French troop mutinies, and the incompetence, indifference and
careerism that produced them. Some soldiers are tried for cowardice
and defended by their regimental commander, Douglas as Col. Dax.
The theme is the responsibility of governments and command. It is a
terrible indictment of war. If the final scene does not break your
heart, nothing will.
</P>
<P>
   Good as ``Private Ryan'' is, Spielberg gives us something less:
Is Pvt. Ryan worth dying for? Given the Omaha Beach scene, that
falls short as an ultimate question. American filmmakers have just
about exhausted the potential of our World War II involvement. For
a reason. You couldn't get 10 people out on a Sunday afternoon to
see, for instance, one of the Eastern front's obscure daily
slaughters.

`SACRE BLEU,' IT'S A NEW REVOLUTION! 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The natives are restless across the pond.
</P>
<P>
   The feisty French are squabbling about food again. And the
normally placid Brits are replaying the Battle of the Sexes, this
time in the name of _ gulp! _ travel writing.
</P>
<P>
   First, the hors d'oeuvres:
</P>
<P>
   We can always depend on the annual designation of Michelin's
revered restaurant stars to create outrage among chefs whose
kitchens are demoted or ignored. But at least Michelin's system is
steeped in French tradition. And only a true connoisseur of
gastronomy _ certainly not the fellow staring at me from the
mirror, the guy who confuses ``veau rognons'' for ``escalope de
veau'' on a menu _ is admitted into the hallowed judging process.
</P>
<P>
   But now, heresy. Common diners are evaluating eateries in Paris.
More than 1,700 diners. At 330,000 meals. And, horror of horrors,
in a survey designed and perfected by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   On Bastille Day (July 14), 80,000 copies of the first Zagat
Survey of Paris restaurants hit the ``rues'' of the capital. And as
Zagat publicists delight in suggesting, a new French Revolution
commenced.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that previous Zagat surveys covering 44 cities or
regions in the United States and Canada are considered the culinary
bibles of North America. Or that Zagat already had invaded London.
As a Parisian aristocrat might say between nibbles of Pyrenees lamb
at Taillevent, who can go wrong grading fish and chips?
</P>
<P>
   The Zagat approach is ``a scandal,'' sniffed Alexandre Lazareff,
head of the French Culinary Writers' Association. He elaborated:
``It's the very negation of a guidebook; it's done by polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Gault Millau, heretofore the upstart challenger to Michelin in
evaluating Parisian restaurants, called the Zagat Survey
``z'agacant,'' a play on the French word for ``annoying.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the fire were kinder comments in the French press. While
conceding that the survey has ``spread terror through kitchens,''
Le Monde suggested that Zagat has made ``the client finally king.''
Paris Match termed the guide ``the ultimate in good taste.'' And Le
Figaro boldly ordained it ``as good as Michelin.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey results themselves brought little surprise. The three
highest rated restaurants _ Taillevent, Arpege and Ambroisie _ all
possess the maximum three Michelin stars. So why the uproar? ``This
is the first time that French diners have been asked to vote on
their restaurants,'' co-publisher Nina Zagat says. ``Our guides are
founded on the simple, but seemingly revolutionary, premise that
many palates are better than one.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, unlike the handful of critics overseeing Michelin's
composite three-star system, Zagat surveyors gave individual grades
for food, decor and _ don't you wish American tourists were allowed
to participate? _ service.

   One palate or 1,710 palates _ these are still French palates.
With French pride. (Did someone say ``arrogance''?) The average
grades were lower (15 for food, 13 for decor and 14 for service on
a 30-point scale) than in London (18, 15 and 16) or New York (19,
16 and 17). But when diners were asked to pinpoint their main
complaints, less than 1 percent cited French food. And all of the
highest-rated eateries _ and the vast majority of 825 restaurants
covered _ serve some variant of French cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Two last bits of intrigue: The average meal in this survey cost
$48.23, compared with $30.69 in New York. And unlike most Zagat
surveys, in which male and female participants are usually
balanced, 71 percent of respondents in Paris were men.
</P>
<P>
   Which takes us across the channel to England.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Guardian newspaper, 11 female authors have
declared war on gung-ho travel writing (by men), claiming that the
genre is dying and should be put out of its misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had enough (men) in the jungle,'' said Dea Birkett,
co-editor of Amazonian, an anthology of women's travel writing
published by Penguin in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men want to conquer the territory they travel through and put
a flag on it,'' Birkett told the newspaper. ``But women want to be
conquered by the territory, to be enchanted and intrigued by it.
That makes for better writing.''
</P>
<P>
   The real essence of travel, Birkett said, is the inner journey.
</P>
<P>
   Balderdash _ or something like that _ responded explorer Wilfred
Thesinger, 88, who shot 70 lions in Sudan and 2,000 boars in Iraq.
``I don't think it's right that (women) should dominate,''
Thesinger told the Guardian. ``They're not equipped for
exploration.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, chimed in traveler Redmon O'Hanlon, who suggested
women are better travelers. ``All the so-called primitive groups
respond better to women,'' O'Hanlon said. ``Women are better at
gossiping; they get information faster.''
</P>
<P>
   That's THESINGER and O'HANLON speaking, not Shattuck. I'll leave
the Brits to their gender dispute. I'm still juggling ``rognons''
and ``escalope.'' &QL;

SHIP CASTS AWAY DOUBTS ABOUT DISNEY'S LATEST VENTURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CANAVERAL, Fla. _ In 1928, Mickey Mouse made a splash as
Steamboat Willie in the world's first sound cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy years later, ol' Mickey is back at the helm. This time,
he's aboard the 83,000-ton cruise ship dubbed Disney Magic.
</P>
<P>
   And while the four-fingered fellow may not be physically at the
ship's wheel, don't be fooled. Mickey is steering this ship.
</P>
<P>
   The neophyte Disney Cruise Line, which launched its inaugural
cruise July 30, isn't just selling a cruise. It is also selling the
Disney experience.
</P>
<P>
   From the pool-side pizzeria named for Pinocchio, the G-rated
audience-participation game shows, the Captain Hook-themed indoor
playground and the mock-tails served at an under-age-only coffee
bar, the theme is family fun.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic doesn't even have a casino, a sacred cash cow for most
cruise lines.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Disney is gambling on seven-day Walt Disney
Resort/cruise vacation packages with double-occupancy prices
starting at $1,295 per person. Guests choose from a three-day
resort stay with four-night cruise or four-day land stay with
three-night cruise. The ship's Bahamian ports of call are Nassau
and a private island known as Castaway Cay.
</P>
<P>
   (When the Disney Wonder, the Magic's twin sister ship, begins
sailing in March, it also will offer three- and four-day cruises,
alternating its itineraries with the Magic.)
</P>
<P>
   On a two-day cruise for the media, we checked out the Disney
Magic and compared it to the hype. The ship was elegant and
impressive and, overall, the cruise satisfactory, but there simply
wasn't enough time or young people aboard to judge the children's
programs, which are the centerpieces of the Disney cruise
experience.
</P>
<P>
   That said, here are some observations:
</P>
<P>
   _ The best space on the ship is Common Grounds, a teen coffee
house where you'd expect to find Jennifer Aniston and pals perched
on the overstuffed sofas. A bar serves coffee drinks and
exotic-looking mock-tails to teens seeking a temporary escape from
parental units and younger siblings. A jukebox spins the latest
music CDs. Don't like what's playing? Reach for one of the many
headphones stationed throughout the room and select alternative
tunes. A large-screen TV, computers and game tables round out this
space.
</P>
<P>
   _ The variety of children's programs is unprecedented on a
cruise line. The Oceaneer Adventure, which takes up nearly a full
deck, provides counselor-supervised programs for children ages 3 to
12. Onboard programs, which are divided by six age groups, may
involve costumes and computers, while shore excursions may feature
scavenger hunts or silly relays.
</P>
<P>
   With supervision provided from 9 a.m. to 1 a.m., ``our
children's programs allow parents to become adults,'' says Erling
Frydenberg, Disney Cruise Line's vice president of operations.
These newly emancipated parents can then enjoy the many adults-only
venues offered on Disney Magic. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Beat Street, a collection of themed nightclubs that includes a
comedy club, piano bar and dance hall with live music.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vista Spa and Salon, which features a state-of-the-art fitness
center, aromatherapy steam rooms and pampering treatments such as
massages and facials.
</P>
<P>
   _ Palo, the romantic, reservations-only Italian restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of restaurants, Disney Magic's rotation dining plan is
unique to cruising. Each evening, passengers rotate to one of three
themed restaurants. While your dining room changes, your table
mates and servers remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurants include Lumiere's, an attractive, French-tinged
dining room that pays tribute to ``Beauty and the Beast''; the
casual and colorful Parrot Cay, a salute to the vibrant style of
the Bahamas; and Animator's Palate, where Disney Imagineers seemed
to have had the most fun.
</P>
<P>
   Animator's Palate is really a dinner show. Guests arrive to find
the restaurant _ and the server's uniform's _ starkly black and
white. As the meal progresses, sketches on the wall begin to show
color. By the time dessert _ here it's called a ``mouseterpiece'' _
is served the room is ablaze with color. Even the wait staff's
jackets _ in a quick-change trick _ are now brightly colored.
</P>
<P>
   For guests not wanting to eat at scheduled seatings, Topsider
Buffet serves lunch and dinner. Poolside snacks can be found at
Pinocchio's Pizzeria, Pluto's Dog House and Scoops, an ice cream
stand.
</P>
<P>
   So what about the food?
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say that it is what you'd expect from a company that
has built its travel reputation on theme parks. A Palo pizza
appetizer was tasty, but a poolside slice was barely passable.
Barbecue served on the cruise line's private island was jeered and
the Parmesan and Herb-Crusted Veal Cutlets at Animator's Palate
needed work.
</P>
<P>
   Service was friendly, earnest and surprisingly smooth
considering that only 40 percent of the crew had cruise experience
before the ship's five two-day shakedown cruises.
</P>
<P>
   While the kitchen could _ and should _ improve, it would be hard
to beat the Disney Magic's entertainment lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to raise the bar here, and we have succeeded in a
number of ways,'' says Disney Cruise Line president Art Rodney,
stopping short of earlier boasts that the entertainment giant would
``revolutionize'' the cruise industry.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Disney has raised the entertainment bar. Its 975-seat
Walt Disney Theater is unrivaled at sea. The stage uses three decks
above and three decks below to hold the scenery and props used in
three original, Broadway-style musical productions.
</P>
<P>
   The productions, all featuring sophisticated lighting and
special effects, include ``Disney Dreams,'' a ``bedtime'' story
starring beloved characters such as Peter Pan and Cinderella;
``Voyage of the Ghost Ship,'' an action tale with pirates and
illusions; and ``Hercules: A Muse-ical Comedy,'' which director of
entertainment Cliff Perry describes as Henny Youngman meets Jon
Lovitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we did our homework,'' Perry says of the productions.
``We found out what guests wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   What guests wanted were entertainment options. In addition to
the musicals, the Disney Magic also offers the trio of Beat Street
clubs, Studio Sea, a family dance club that hosts
guest-participation game shows, and ESPN Skybox, where guests can
gather to watch sporting programming including live events in a
high energy setting. The ESPN Skybox takes its name from its unique
position inside the ship's front funnel on Deck 11.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, guests will find a movie theater, video arcade,
three pools and a sports deck for activities such as basketball,
paddle tennis, volleyball and badminton.
</P>
<P>
   First-time cruisers, which Disney expects will make up a large
percentage of its customers, may not appreciate the size of the
Magic's cabins. The staterooms are about 25 percent larger than the
average cruise ship. One- and two-bedroom suites can sleep as many
as five in relative spaciousness. More than 70 percent of the
cabins have ocean views, many with private verandahs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you must pay for this spaciousness.
</P>
<P>
   A Disney cruise will cost an average of 20 percent more than a
similar cruise with another line. With the Disney resort-and-cruise
vacation, guests also get air fare; a three- or four-day stay at a
Walt Disney World Resort; unlimited admission to the four WDW theme
parks, including the new Animal Kingdom; unlimited admission to the
three Disney water parks, as well as admission to Pleasure Island,
the resort's evening entertainment complex, and Disney's Wild World
of Sports; unlimited use of the WDW transportation system; a three-
or four-day cruise to the Bahamas; and ground transfers between the
resort, the ship and the Orlando airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't sell price,'' explains Disney Cruise Line president
Art Rodney. ``We're not the economy cruise. We sell value.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to leave the ship saying this was the best
vacation they've ever had. You can't put a price on that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rodney did.
</P>
<P>
   Vacation packages start at $1,295 per person based on double
occupancy. Children ages 3 to 17 sharing a cabin with two adults
pay $999.

PARTYING IN DISNEY'S PARADISE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Private islands are not new to the cruise scene.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line started the trend when it bought a
four-mile strip in the Bahamas in 1977. Now most cruise lines claim
their own isle.
</P>
<P>
   Disney Cruise Line's Castaway Cay was designed to fulfill the
traveler's dream of paradise: towering palm trees, acres of
white-sand beaches and incandescent blue water. Toss in a
snorkeling course, biking and hiking trails, sea kayaks,
watercraft, two bars, a massage cabana, a barbecue shack,
umbrella-shaded lounge chairs and a rockin' reggae band.
</P>
<P>
   Whew, it's a nonstop party. In paradise.
</P>
<P>
   And Disney folks are quick to say that they didn't do much to
improve the island _ if you don't count the 500-foot dock that
allows Disney Magic guests almost instant access to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enhanced what already was there,'' says Jim Durham, Walt
Disney Imagineering Project Manager for Castaway Cay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just let Mother Nature show her beauty,'' Durham says,
adding, ``We didn't kill a tree'' as they added guest services such
as restrooms and bars.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five Disney staffers live on the island, but Disney has
no plans to open it to overnight guests.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to see ``paradise'' is to book a Disney cruise.

A STICKY WICKET IN PRIVATIZATION OF WELFARE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There is money to be made from welfare. Or so
the decision-makers at Gtech Corp. thought when they bid for _ and
won _ a contract from state government to operate the Lone Star
Card.
</P>
<P>
   That's the debit-type card system that electronically provides
welfare and food stamp benefits to low-income Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Gtech was eager to keep cashing in on the expanding popularity
of government privatization. Instead, its welfare venture has cast
some more doubt on public-private partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   Gtech already was making millions off the Texas lottery, which
it operated under a separate state contract, when it formed a
subsidiary, Transactive Corp., to bid for the welfare business.
</P>
<P>
   Transactive outbid a competitor, Citicorp Services, for the Lone
Star contract in 1994 but soon started regretting it.
</P>
<P>
   When welfare rolls started dropping, thanks to an improved
economy and welfare reforms, Gtech discovered the welfare business
wasn't so lucrative after all.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gtech asked the state for a better deal, but state
officials refused and held the company to its contract. Now, Gtech
is trying to sell its Lone Star Card business to Citicorp, the
losing bidder in 1994, and the U.S. Department of Justice is
raising a red flag.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has filed a federal lawsuit to block the
proposed sale because, government lawyers argue, it would reduce
competition in the welfare delivery business and threaten savings
that state governments _ and their taxpayers _ hope to realize from
electronic transfer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Gtech also wants to sell to Citicorp other electronic welfare
systems that it operates in Illinois, Indiana and Sacremento
County, Calif. Citicorp already has contracts for similar systems
in 28 other states.
</P>
<P>
   Some may say it's un-American and anti-free enterprise for the
government to try to keep a private company from selling a business
the company doesn't find profitable _ or profitable enough to be
worth the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the Justice Department's anti-trust
division, which initiated the suit, isn't trying to keep Gtech from
selling its welfare delivery contracts. It is only trying to block
a sale to Citicorp, which, it said, would give that company a
virtual monopoly on running electronic benefits systems in states
that already have them.
</P>
<P>
   And the monopoly could grow, because federal law will require
all the states to put welfare benefits on electronic transfer
systems by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of electronic transfers _ Comptroller John Sharp has
been one of the biggest advocates in Texas _ say they are a more
efficient way of distributing benefits and also reduce fraud by
eliminating paper food stamps, which some people used to illegally
sell.
</P>
<P>
   By requiring states to use electronic systems, federal lawmakers
may have thought they also were encouraging competition and cost
savings in the private sector because this is the type of work that
state governments would likely contract out to private operators.
</P>
<P>
   It is true the states are contracting the systems out, but only
two corporate giants have expressed much interest in operating
them. And one of those companies, Gtech, is now trying to bail out
to concentrate on the more lucrative business of running lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   So one arm of the federal government, Congress, may have
inadvertently encouraged the development of a monopoly that now
another government arm, the Justice Department, finds it necessary
to fight.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be the first time that government has ended up
contradicting itself.
</P>
<P>
   Privatization of some government services still offers the
promise of savings through the expertise and efficiency that free
enterprise can offer. But it must be approached with care.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, private companies consider their business records
private, an attitude that often conflicts with the public's right
to have its business conducted and recorded in public, even if the
business is conducted by a private company.
</P>
<P>
   And businesses, unlike government, have to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   If Texas' state government had operated its own electronic
welfare system, state officials _ and taxpayers _ would have simply
applauded their budgetary savings when the welfare rolls started
dropping.
</P>
<P>
   But Transactive, whose payments are based on the number of
people receiving food stamps and cash assistance, considered the
reduced welfare caseload a disaster because the reductions were
more than had been projected when its contract was bid.
Consequently, the company started trying to change or get out of
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Transactive negotiated a bad contract. Maybe Texas chose
the wrong company to operate the Lone Star Card.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe privatization and welfare, at least in this case,
weren't a natural fit.

FORMER GIANT GEARS UP FOR APPEARANCE ON NEW TEAM: CBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETE DOUGHERTY  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Game days were the worst. Although he took his last
snap with the New York Giants in 1993, for Phil Simms the urge
lingered every time he entered a stadium in his new career as a
broadcaster. He wanted to be out there throwing passes, running the
two-minute drill, even handing off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do get addicted to it,'' Simms said, ``to the life, to the
playing, to the fun, to the work.'' Over the course of last season,
Simms' third with NBC and fourth as an NFL analyst, the player
finally was exorcised and the broadcaster emerged. Not that he let
the withdrawal symptoms from football affect his work in the booth.
He was on NBC's lead announcing team and will do the same for CBS,
which won the American Conference rights from its network rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably for the first time, I really relaxed and said it's
over,'' Simms said. ``I didn't go to the game thinking, `I'd really
like to be in uniform today.' That's over now. It's good. It's a
little more relaxing. It makes me more committed to my job than
ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS has high hopes for this rising star, who spent 15 years in
one NFL uniform but already is with his third network. Simms showed
his potential in a one-year stint at ESPN, enough to warrant NBC
gambling not only to hire him, but putting him with Dick Enberg and
Paul Maguire to cover the network's ``A'' game each week.
</P>
<P>
   Simms proved to be a worthwhile risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a quarterback got hurt, he is so up on the game plan and
the trends of the game, he could dress up and play,'' said Mark
Wolff, the lead NFL producer for CBS. ``He studies as hard as
anybody I know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of guys who we've shown how to do that,''
director Larry Cavolina added, ``but he does naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has slowly weaned me off of playing,'' Simms said. ``It's
good to be around it. I love going and hanging out and watching
practice, watching the personality of the coach. We have pretty
good access where we get to talk to the coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he rarely gets interviewed where he isn't asked about
whether he can be critical of coaches and players he shared the
sidelines with only a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Simms said he just gives his views of the game, regardless of
consequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never, since I've been in the booth, have I thought, `Well,
I'd better not say that, because somebody might get upset,''' he
said. ``It just doesn't cross your mind. I said something once
about Bill (Parcells) that was pretty critical. People applauded
me. So I see Bill, and I say something to him about it, and he
says, `Simms, I don't care. If you said it, it was probably true.'
He trusted my opinion because he knows I know what was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having a current player sitting there in the booth
and saying exactly what's happening on the field and what's going
through their minds,'' said Greg Gumbel, Simms' new partner. ``He's
a contemporary. He just happens to be in the booth. That's a
tremendous advantage over someone saying, `Well, the way I used to
do it ...,' back in the days of the leather helmets. His ability to
perceive what's happening on the field is exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What Gumbel and CBS hope adds to the telecasts is that Simms
should have more air time. CBS won't use a three-man booth,
although Armen Keteyian has been hired as a sideline reporter for
the ``A'' team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe Phil had the time, from a pure mathematics
point of view, to say the things he could say during a game,''
Gumbel said. ``He won't have those problems with me. I'll tell you
what down it is and how many yards to go, then get the hell out of
his way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three people in a car compared to two _ the road is less
crowded,'' Simms said. ``It just makes it easier. Now, can you make
it better? Just because it's easier, it doesn't make it better.
That's what we're going to try to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms was at Giants' camp last week doing some homework and
renewing acquaintances. He didn't leave Albany until 10 o'clock
that night, spending most of that time with head coach Jim Fassel,
Simms' former quarterback coach and offensive coordinator with the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great being around Jim, seeing the team and the guys,''
he said. ``I got a chance to really sit back and watch football
again. I felt like a player in camp. It was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   At least it wasn't game day.

<P>
   CAIRO _ On the streets of a city known for its horrific traffic,
only the beggars move.
</P>
<P>
   Weaving between cars stuck in a mile-long backup stretching from
Tahrir Square, an army of street kids and old men on crutches hold
out their hands to trapped motorists. A scorching midday sun makes
the filthy air feel like an industrial furnace. Those condemned to
this existential nightmare honk their horns in vain protest.
</P>
<P>
   This is the ``Triangle of Hell'' where Cairo's three main
squares meet. The streets are so overcrowded _ more than a million
vehicles clog the roads in a city of 15 million people _ that 10
years ago city planners dreamed up a $7 billion subway system.
</P>
<P>
   And with the largest phase of the project nearing completion,
shiny new subway cars run beneath the madness above ground in an
air-conditioned world that is quiet, clean, and efficient. The
metro has the feel of a museum. Statues and bronze murals that tell
of Egypt's ancient past are exhibited along the walls of the subway
platforms. Commuters can also watch television while they wait for
trains, which have a record of running on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1986 and scheduled for completion in 2003, the project
is on such a grand scale that the chairman of the bureaucracy
overseeing the metro boasts that it is ``the fourth pyramid, being
built by modern-day pharaohs.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other transportation project in the world that
surpasses it, in terms of cost and scope and traffic headaches, is
Boston's $10.8 billion Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   By 2005, the expanded Cairo metro system, and a new one to be
built in Alexandria, will carry 7 million passengers a day over 100
miles of track.
</P>
<P>
   The project has also become a gold mine for large multinational
engineering firms. Most of the major players in the industry have
gotten a piece of the action. The United States' Parsons
Brinckerhoff, a participant in the Big Dig, nabbed the management
contract. Japan's Mitsubishi is building most of the coaches.
Germany's Herrenknecht GmbH has named two tunneling machines for
ancient Egyptian royals ``Hatshepsut'' and ``Nefertiti'' that are
cutting a path under the Nile to Giza, site of Egypt's ancient
Sphinx and three most famous pyramids.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Stacey, the Cairo program manager for New York-based
Parsons Brinckerhoff has worked on many of the world's largest
engineering projects, including the new tunnel connecting England
and France and Hong Kong's metro system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cairo hasn't gotten the same press attention, but this is a
very big project,'' said Stacey. ``The thing that makes it unique
is the sense of immediate improvement on people's lives. You don't
always get that feeling in these big projects. This project isn't
flashy. There aren't a lot of engineering marvels, but it is making
it possible to move a lot of people through the city.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new metro lines, despite their efficiency, have barely
affected Cairo's horrific traffic. This is due in part to Egypt's
surging population, now 60 million, which may outstrip the capacity
of the metro system.
</P>
<P>
   Planners estimate there are still some 6 million commuters who
waste as much as 10 million hours a day in traffic. The congestion
has severely damaged Egypt's struggling economy. And pollution is
undermining air quality, causing a national health problem as well
as serious damage to the ancient monuments that are the lifeblood
of the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   Cairo has some of the worst traffic in the world. Driving
through Boston is a breeze by comparison. Many international
experts say that traffic in Mexico City and Tokyo is equally
nightmarish. But others say that Cairo is in a class by itself
because unlike drivers in Tokyo, few here obey traffic laws and
unlike public transit in Mexico City, buses here are in short
supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffic problem is greatly exacerbated by the culture of
our drivers,'' conceded Mohammed Mitainy, an engineering professor
at Cairo University and a traffic expert who is a consultant to the
Egyptian government on the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary problem is that people do not obey traffic laws
and the police do not enforce them,'' said Mitainy. ``Egyptians
seem to favor chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Another major obstacle, he said, is Egypt's Kafkaesque
bureaucracy. Worse, one must negotiate it in person to achieve
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot change a national culture even with the most
advanced engineering in the world. To some extent, it will never go
away,'' Mitainy said. ``But we hope to alleviate it.''
</P>
<P>
   One must be in its center to comprehend how chaotic Cairo's
traffic is. Automotive hulks that are 30 years old vie with
overcrowded buses belching black smoke as they lurch through
potholed streets. The vehicles compete for narrow road space with
boys on bicycles who balance bread trays on their heads, farmers on
donkey carts loaded with produce, and pedestrians who risk their
lives crossing the street. Traffic police who begin their days
dressed in spotless white usually end up at dusk perched on median
strips, defeated, their uniforms dark with soot.
</P>
<P>
   The mayhem above ground helps explain why the new metro system
is a source of immense national pride, especially for Egypt's
middle class, which is squeezed between a huge underclass and a
tiny government and business elite that controls most of the
wealth. The system is designed to serve middle class neighborhoods,
so the metro has become their signature mode of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad Hassan, 30, works in the accounting department of a
private company and lives in a suburb north of the city. He rushes
home to his family from Sadat Station, named for Anwar Sadat, the
slain president, in Cairo's downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan used to spend an hour and a half traveling by bus to his
office in Tahrir Square. But since the metro line from his suburb
to Cairo's center was finished two years ago, he has cut his
commute to a mere 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has changed my life,'' Hassan said. ``That is not an
exaggeration. I have more time and I don't have to fight for my
life on the buses. This is the greatest thing'' President Hosni
``Mubarak has done for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip to the University of Cairo for Nermine Hassanein, 24, a
graduate student in art, has been pared from two hours to half an
hour on a new line that opened last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around you. There is art, and it is cool and
comfortable,'' she said. ``It's like a different world. The same
people as up on the street, but a different world.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitainy, the engineering professor, bristled at the comparison
of the metro project to another Egyptian engineering marvel _ the
pyramids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pyramids were built by slaves for mystical reasons to
honor the pharaohs,'' he said. ``This project provides some 25,000
paying jobs and its goals are very practical _ to improve people's
everyday lives.''

BRITAIN'S PLAN TO CURB TRAFFIC: MAKE 'EM PAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, unveiled
his 170-page plan on how to get more people to use public
transportation, he arrived at Westminster via the Underground,
London's ubiquitous subway system.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Dukakis he ain't. After announcing the first serious
attempt at curbing Britain's burgeoning traffic problem in 20
years, Prescott left Parliament the old fashioned way: in a Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   Prescott's departure from the House of Commons didn't exactly
inspire confidence in the masses, many of whom think the British
government has a better chance of restoring the empire than it does
of improving traffic flow in the capital, let alone the rest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, a musician in an anarchist band threw a bucket
of cold water on Prescott at Britain's version of the Grammy
awards. Many Britons are giving Prescott's ideas on reducing
traffic a similar dousing.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, motorists will be charged tolls to drive into
towns, and businesses that provide parking spaces to their
employees will be taxed. Businesses will get socked an average of
about $250 per parking space, but in central London, where space is
at a premium, companies will have to fork over about $850 per year
for each spot.
</P>
<P>
   The government hopes those charges will push commuters and
shoppers onto trains and buses, which will be beneficiaries of the
$1.65 billion the new fees are expected to raise.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The government says about 10 percent of the people who take
their cars to work must switch to public transportation over the
next few years or Britain in general, and London in particular,
will experience gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Such dire predictions make little impression on the average
Brit, however. Londoners, in particular, are cynical about the
government's plans, and about the traffic problem overall.
</P>
<P>
   Harriet Cundy, a real estate agent, lives in Fulham, in the
center of London near the River Thames. But she works in Hampstead,
4 miles north. She says her commute in the morning rush hour is
only about a half-hour. Even if it were two or three times that,
she said, she would do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply need a car to work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   John Porter, doorman at the Park Lane Hotel in Mayfair, is
typical of Londoners who think traffic has gotten worse in recent
years, but believe there's little government can do to change the
car culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other advertisement on the radio or the telly is for a
car,'' he said. ``If you have the money to buy a car, tolls aren't
going to put you off.''
</P>
<P>
   Automobiles are becoming more ingrained in British life.
Recently, companies in London's financial district have started
giving employees company cars to dissuade them from jumping ship.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Traffic here can be maddening, but it appears no worse than
Boston, Manhattan, or Dublin. Recently, the Metropolitan Police
closed off lanes on Cromwell Road near South Kensington, creating
midday gridlock. Asked for an explanation, a cop just smiled and
said, ``Security.'' Traffic reports on the radio refer mysteriously
to ``incidents'' that lead to lane closures, but that's about as
detailed as the explanations get.
</P>
<P>
   The government, meanwhile, says it wants to reduce the number of
people using cars to ferry children to school. Just how they'll do
this is still a little vague. While America has the yellow school
bus, the family car serves that purpose in Britain. Driving
children to school by car is very much a part of British life,
accounting for an estimated 20 percent of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   A few mothers who were picking their children up at summer
classes at Annemount Nursery School in Hampstead Garden Suburb were
asked whether they would consider walking their children to school
instead. They all guffawed.
</P>

CAPITOL SLAY SUSPECT'S MIND AN ISSUE OF LIFE, DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They went to Russell Eugene Weston Jr.'s remote
Montana cabin and his Illinois hometown hoping to find evidence and
answers, but last week's FBI search only complicated the question
facing Justice Department lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Was the tragedy that unfolded in the US Capitol on July 24 the
work of a delusionary psychotic or the product of a calculating
mind bent on destruction? Was there a method to the madness? Or
only madness?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, legal specialists say, could determine whether the
federal government seeks the death penalty for the shooting deaths
of US Capitol Police officers, Jacob Chestnut of Fort Washington,
Md., and John Gibson, a Waltham, Mass., native.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, 41, is a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic who refused
his medication. He shouted at satellite dishes believing they were
the tools of spies, applied to the CIA for a job, sued an
86-year-old woman for assault, and said the federal government
planted land mines on his property.
</P>
<P>
   The same man, however, reportedly stashed away a personal diary
and highly organized notes and correspondences with various
branches of the federal government, and kept a ``CIA packet,'' a
.22-caliber handgun, a shotgun, gunpowder, and a box of Remington
.38 Special cartridges in his Montana cabin, according to FBI court
documents unsealed last week.
</P>
<P>
   Government prosecutors are sorting through these contradictory
strands of behavior _ one indicating forethought and planning, the
other seemingly irrational and uncontrolled _ as they hash out
their legal strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is early in the investigation, high-ranking federal
law enforcement officials and legal specialists say the Justice
Department will be struggling for weeks, if not months, over the
death penalty question. The final decision will be made after a
panel of high-level department officials present the facts to
Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors will be considered: the severity and nature of the
crime, and the nature and mental state of the defendant, according
to David Schertler, former homicide chief in the US attorney's
office in the District of Columbia, which is prosecuting Weston.
</P>
<P>
   The government, Schertler said, has been chastened by the
Unabomber trial, during which prosecutors agreed to drop the death
penalty against Theodore Kaczynski in exchange for a guilty plea
and four life sentences. The trial was lengthy, messy, and widely
considered a tragedy that bordered at times on farce. It was acted
out by a defendant who refused to admit to his mental illness and
rejected the advice of his legal team in a proceeding that could
have ended with his own death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government saw Kaczynski's mental state, which only
revealed itself during the trial, as a strong factor against
getting the death penalty,'' said Schertler. ``This lesson may be
applied to Weston.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors will need to weigh public sentiment, which may
clamor for swift and severe punishment for a wrenching crime _ or
recoil at putting someone who is mentally ill to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question at a very profound level is, `Does this person
deserve the most extreme form of punishment, the ultimate
retribution?''' said Richard Bonnie, director of the University of
Virginia's Institute of Law, Psychiatry and Public Policy. ``Even
if we say the person is blameworthy and responsible, the issue of
diminished responsibility because of mental illness comes to the
fore.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Bonnie adds, a claim of insanity means, ``Don't convict
me or blame me or punish me _ treat me ... a claim all of us are on
some level disturbed by.''
</P>
<P>
   With emotions running high and incriminating evidence _
including a security videotape of the crime and shells matching
those found at the scene _ mounting against Weston, legal
specialists say prosecutors may have no choice. ``There are degrees
of vigor in prosecution, and if they are forced to go for the death
penalty, it will be with no real intent to see things through,''
said one high-ranking government law enforcement official who
requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's lawyers will have to decide whether to strike a deal
with prosecutors, go for a guilty plea, and spare their client's
life, or try to prove he is legally insane _ a much tougher
standard that goes beyond a medical diagnosis of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   While Weston remains under heavy guard at a Washington hospital
recovering from the Capitol shootout, his lawyers last week were
granted a two-week delay in his arraignment. They also won
permission to bring in two more prominent psychiatrists to evaluate
their client, an action that legal specialists say strongly
suggests they are considering an insanity defense.
</P>
<P>
   The insanity defense is used in only 1 percent of all criminal
proceedings, and succeeds in 25 percent of those cases. Congress
made it more difficult to win an insanity defense after John
Hinckley Jr. was found not guilty by reason of insanity after
shooting and wounding President Reagan in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I know to assess criminal culpability is to ask,
did the defendant know what he was doing, could he control his
actions, did he hear the voice of a dog telling him what to do,''
said Steven Lapham, a prosecutor in the Unabomber trial who says he
never believed Kazcynski was severely mentally impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Under today's law, Weston's lawyers would have to prove not only
that he is mentally ill but also that his illness prevented him
from knowing that killing two police officers was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, however, would probably call their own
psychiatrists and FBI behavioral specialists to show that Weston
may be disturbed but not criminally insane.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it becomes a battle of the experts, what the jury
sometimes does is throw both arguments out and become junior
experts themselves,'' said Laurie Levenson, the associate dean of
Loyola Law School and a former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two things juries hate, planning and covering up,''
said Jack Evans, a criminologist at Northeastern University and
author of several books on homicide.

WHAT GIVES THE OCEAN ITS SMELL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why does the ocean smell the way it does?
</P>
<P>
   E.R., Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Dimethylsulfide. That ``smells like the ocean'' smell of
fresh salt air is a gas that comes from phytoplankton, the tiny
plants that are the base of the ocean's food chain.
</P>
<P>
   According to John Dacey, associate scientist at the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution, the water inside phytoplankton cells is
less alty than the water outside. The salt in the ocean tries to
chemically draw the less-salty water out of phytoplankton cells. To
prevent this, the microscopic plants have evolved a way to produce
dimethylsulfonioproprionate (DMSP), which floats around inside the
cells, counteracting what the salt is trying to do outside.
</P>
<P>
   When phytoplankton die, or get eaten by tiny marine animal
organisms, the DMSP breaks down and releases dimethylsulfide (DMS),
a gas that bubbles up into the atmosphere. At sea level,
concentrations of a few hundred parts per trillion are enough to
tell your nose that you're on or near the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the odor depends on the concentrations of DMS.
The smell is often stonger near the coast, where phytoplankton
concentrations are generally higher. And it's less like the ocean
where phytoplankton levels are lower _ where the water is clear _
like the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   We're not the only creatures who enjoy a good whiff of DMS.
Certain sea birds can zoom in on the highest concentrations of the
gas, apparently because the smell indicates an area rich in
phytoplankton and the biological processes involved in breaking it
down. In other words, a good place to look for food.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do people get crushed when they dive deep in the water,
but whales don't?
</P>
<P>
   L.C., Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's actually only our lungs, sinuses, and auditory canals &UR;  &LR; _
the cavities that contain gas _ that are affected by pressure. The
rest of us, made up mostly of water, is no more affected by
underwater pressure than water itself. That's why fish don't squish
under pressure; they're mostly water, too.
</P>
<P>
   Whale lung tissues have evolved to tolerate levels of
compression that would rip ours apart. They also have bigger lungs,
compared to the rest of their body, than we landlubbers do. So even
after they're compressed, they still have oxygen-holding capacity.
Whales' sinuses and inner ear structures are protected deep inside
thick bones that resist pressure. And they have something in their
outer ears that we're supposed to clean out of ours: a thick plug
of wax that keeps sea water from pushing into their auditory
canals.
</P>
<P>
   And besides that, most whales (including the right and
humpbacks) don't dive all that deep. ``They spend most of their
time in the epipelagic zone, the sunlit layer of the ocean within a
few hundred feet of the surface, where their food is,'' says
Charles Mayo of Provincetown's Center for Coastal Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The real pressure test comes for species like the sperm whale,
believed to swim to depths of at least 7,000 feet on dives that
last up to two hours. Mayo says he and researchers, for fun, used
to put Styrofoam cups into research nets lowered to such depths.
``They'd come back up the size of shot glasses. All the air had
been compressed out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   So how do sperm whales take that plunge and not come back up the
size of a mackerel? ``We believe that sperm whales evacuate their
lungs before they dive,'' says Roger Payne of Lincoln's Whale
Conservation Institute. ``Then they use the oxygen stored in
myoglobin.''
</P>
<P>
   Myoglobin is what lets whales stay down longer than we can. The
underwater-hold-your-breath record for humans is around 11 minutes.
Myoglobin is an oxygen-carrying protein which releases the oxygen
more slowly into the body. It can even store oxygen in muscle
tissue. Whales have a lot more of it than we.

GOP HOPEFUL FINDS A WAY TO EXCEED THE CONTRIBUTION LIMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a move that could reshape presidential
fund-raising, Lamar Alexander is using a little-known campaign law
in his home state to collect contributions of up to $100,000 per
person, 20 times the federal limit.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's use of a Tennessee-based political action committee
is significant because he is turning much of the money over to his
federal PAC, which is financing the former governor's pre-campaign
travels around the country.
</P>
<P>
   During the first six months of this year, the former Tennessee
governor transferred $1 million to his federal committee for
``overhead'' costs, according to records filed in Tennessee last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's fund transfer has not been previously reported. Some
of Alexander's rivals expressed surprise when they heard about the
transfer, saying they were unaware such cash movements were legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's incredible,'' said Craig Whitney, political director
for former Vice President Dan Quayle's PAC, Campaign America. ``I
didn't know you could do that. I'm flabbergasted.'' Other
presidential prospects might copy the tactic of raising unlimited
contributions in a state PAC. Quayle is already doing that. Quayle
lives in Arizona, where campaign laws prohibit unlimited
contributions to a state PAC. So Quayle recently set up a PAC in
Virginia, where the laws are lenient and allow unlimited
contributions. So far, Quayle has not collected much money for the
Virginia PAC and has not transferred money between his funds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Alexander is not the only presidential prospect to find a
way around contribution limits. Steve Forbes is using a private
company to raise unlimited contributions, an unprecedented tactic
that has helped him collect $10 million since last year. Alexander
comes in second in total contributions, with his two PACs receiving
$4.9 million. Quayle is third with $3.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the possible field of candidates lags behind,
relying on the traditional method of using a federal political
action account to accept contributions no greater than $5,000 per
person annually. For example, House Democratic leader Richard
Gephardt has collected $694,000 during the same 18-month period for
his Effective Government PAC.
</P>
<P>
   But the race for cash among White House prospects could change
dramatically as they realize how Alexander and Forbes are gaining a
head start with their unorthodox tactics. Alexander's method is
most likely to be copied because donors would rather contribute to
a political committee than a nonprofit company, specialists in
campaign finance said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's operation creates a state-based ``soft money''
machine, paralleling the way the major national political parties
collect unregulated and unlimited contributions. The collection of
soft money has led to complaints that the campaign finance system
is out of control, but efforts to control it have failed repeatedly
on Capitol Hill. Last week the House passed an overhaul plan and
sent it to a reluctant Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is one of 28 states that allow PACs to accept
unlimited contributions. Massachusetts limits PAC contributions to
$500 per person annually. Senator John F. Kerry, who is considering
a presidential bid, has not established a PAC and is paying off his
debt from the 1996 Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Alexander has the ability to collect a large
amount of money from a small group of wealthy people. For example,
the $1.8 million he raised the first six months this year came from
just 61 people.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, meanwhile, set up his not-for-profit company called
Americans for Hope, Growth and Opportunity, which takes unlimited
contributions used to pay for his travels and advertisements that
promote his views.
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes financed much of his own 1996 presidential
campaign, he has relied solely on contributions to raise $6 million
this year and $4 million last year, according to an aide, William
Dal Col. In the process, Forbes has collected a database of 130,000
dues-paying members of the private Americans for Hope, Growth and
Opportunity, Dal Col said. Forbes has also set up a PAC with the
same name as his vehicle for donating money to other candidates,
but the effort is minuscule in comparison, with only $32,000
collected.
</P>
<P>
   These tactics provide a window into the way a race for the White
House can be financed below the national radar screen, even before
a candidacy is officially announced. As the 1996 campaign showed,
only a handful of the best-financed candidates make it to the first
primary, and most of them quickly fade unless they have spent a
year or two collecting money. Money, of course, is no guarantee of
success. The well-financed Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas
Republican, dropped out before the New Hampshire primary in 1996
due to his poor showing in the Iowa caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Alexander knows about the need for huge amounts of early
cash as well as anyone. After losing the Republican nomination in
1996, Alexander wrote that the $1,000 limit on individual
contributions to presidential campaigns should be eased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the limits, voters are more likely to see a comet
than meet a presidential candidate, unless they have $1,000, or
live in Iowa and New Hampshire,'' Alexander wrote in Campaigns and
Elections magazine, referring to the states with the first caucus
and primary. But with no fanfare, Alexander has in effect tossed
aside the limits during this precampaign phase by taking advantage
of Tennessee laws.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Alexander recently took Iowa businessman Donald
Lamberti to breakfast. As the conversation turned to money, the
former education secretary said Lamberti could give an unlimited
amount of cash to Alexander's Tennessee-based committee, and exceed
the $5,000 limit on the federal PAC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to be legal. I said, `Can I give that?''' recalled
Lamberti, chairman of Casey's General Stores, a chain of 1,120
convenience stores. ``He said that in Tennessee, a state PAC has no
limits. I said, `Yes,' right on the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamberti then contributed $95,000 to Alexander's state PAC _ 19
times what he could have given to the federal PAC.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberti said he assumed that much of the money would be
contributed to Iowans running for office this year, because it was
in Alexander's interest to gain favor with Iowa politicians.
Alexander did not respond to a request for comment. Instead, his
consultant, Stan Huckaby, stressed that the PACs operate legally.
And Alexander's press spokesman, Dan Wolter, said the $1 million
transfer to cover overhead for six months includes rent, salaries,
and travel.
</P>
<P>
   The typical purpose of PACs is to collect money from a wide
variety of people and distribute the funds to candidates favored by
the PAC's leader. But in reality, many PACs are vehicles to promote
the committee's leader, paying for travel, lodging, food, staff,
and even radio advertisements, all of which help a presidential
prospect remain visible and build a network of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three months of this year, while Alexander's state
PAC was spending so much on overhead, it gave $14,750 to Tennessee
candidates. The PAC also spent $14,296 on radio ads to boost his
possible presidential candidacy in the first-primary state of New
Hampshire, and it gave $14,000 to the Iowa Republican Party.

INSURANCE INDUSTRY, COMMUNITY GET A BREAK AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until recently, most members of the Massachusetts Legislature
considered giving insurance companies a tax break the equivalent of
taking a poison pill, since such a move probably would have ended
their political careers.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry has not exactly been popular among voters
or legislators. Many people have, over the years, had run-ins with
life, property, or casualty insurers. As a result, few legislators
have been eager to give the industry a break.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that other kinds of companies received requested tax
breaks to stay in, or move to, the state; a tax break for insurers
was deemed unpassable.
</P>
<P>
   Then things began to change _ due to the work of a few key
legislators (particularly one state senator), a few insurance
lobbyists who could give the profession a good name, and a few
community groups.
</P>
<P>
   The senator was the same one who helped pass legislation, such
as the mutual funds bill, that led to important job growth in the
Bay State: Senator Warren Tolman, the Watertown Democrat who is
candidate for lieutenant governor and a strong ally of labor.
</P>
<P>
   With Tolman's help, an insurance industry bill that once was
considered unpassable became this summer the first law of its kind
in Massachusetts. The legislation finally gave the insurance
industry the tax relief it had been seeking for at least 15 years.
But the bill also brings some reform.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for up to $50 million in tax relief over the next
five years, insurers would contribute a total of $200 million to
community investment. The money would be used to build affordable
housing and help minority-owned and women-owned businesses. It
would also aid other programs aimed at revitalizing low-income
areas. Insurance companies who choose not to participate simply do
not get a break.
</P>
<P>
   The evolutionary process that resulted in this law began in the
early 1990s, when the insurance companies realized they needed tax
relief to remain competitive. Lawmakers said they wanted something
in return.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other industries that had been involved in this quid
pro quo, insurance companies could not guarantee job growth.
Perhaps they could find other ways to invest their money. That's
when the insurers and community groups such as the Massachusetts
Affordable Housing Alliance began to consider each other as
mutually beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get tax reform, we needed to do what is required,'' said
Frank O'Brien, regional manager and counsel for the Alliance of
American Insurers. ``So the logical thing was to work toward some
kind of community investment.''
</P>
<P>
   So two years ago, insurers and community groups began to talk.
Slowly, they began to realize they had common ground.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the two groups had different ideas of what a ``good
deal'' was, O'Brien recalled. ``Our idea was to get a decent rate
of return on our investment,'' he said. ``Their idea of a good
investment was a good return to the community, such as a new health
center.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the two sides committed to working together, the next step
was to draft a bill that everyone could live with. It was not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Various versions of a tax relief-community investment bill were
drafted, but failed to win wide support. Tolman, chairman of the
Joint Committee on Taxation, remained committed to getting a bill
that would pass muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I was in the midst of a statewide campaign, I still
had 30 days left as an active state senator, so I knew I had to do
everything I could to get my legislative priorities passed,''
Tolman said. He continued talking to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   A version of the bill passed the House, but as the close of this
year's legislative session drew near, it became clear that various
involved parties had problems with the bill. Senate passage was
seriously in doubt. Insurance industry officials and community
activists looked to Tolman not just as &UR;  &LR; a key player, but as the
key player.
</P>
<P>
   Tolman _ having improved his relationship with Senate President
Thomas F. Birmingham after the two were potential rivals in the 8th
District congressional race _ worked to get at least portions of a
bill acceptable to all parties. Working with him were Democratic
Senators Stan Rosenberg of Amherst, Linda Melconian of Springfield,
and Dianne Wilkerson of Roxbury. In addition to O'Brien, key
insurance lobbyists were Vin Shanley and William Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   On the community side, key players were Marc Draisen of the
Massachusetts Community Development Corporation and Thomas Callahan
of the Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance, and the Rev.
Charles Stith, who helped to forge a workable alliance with the
insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts paid off, and the measure passed. The person who
is given, and deserves, the most credit for finally getting it done
is Tolman. ``Warren was an absolutely key player,'' O'Brien said.
``He got people to move.'' And that, in essence, is what Tolman is
all about.

SCOTT HARSHBARGER: PEACHY ACTIVIST

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's an image that sticks with his Harvard classmates
some 34 years later: halfback Scotty Harshbarger carrying the
football, knees churning, arms pumping, carrying would-be tacklers
with him as he charged for the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   He was neither stylish nor flashy nor particularly fast. But he
was intent, focused, the personification of drive and
determination. If he couldn't elude opponents, he'd put his head
down and try to run through them.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since he left the Ivy League gridiron, that same
drive has taken Harshbarger from improbable underdog to winner in
almost every political race he has run. But it has also won him a
host of enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after he first entered politics, Harshbarger's
drive has carried him by the flashier US Representative Joseph
Kennedy II, sidelined last year by family misdeeds, to a
front-runner's position for the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination, and into a near tie with Acting Governor Paul Cellucci,
according to polls.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike at Harvard, where the Pennsylvania minister's
gregarious son was so popular he was elected a class marshal,
Harshbarger is a controversial figure as he runs for governor,
liked by some, but loathed by others.
</P>
<P>
   That same hard-charging style, combined with a moralistic _ some
would say preachy _ tone has led some to charge that he's run
roughshod over reputations and trampled on fairness as he's plunged
ahead in politics.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, his determination to find a way or to make one has
seen Harshbarger pioneer approaches, by, for instance, pressing
banks to invest in poor urban neighborhoods, demanding more
community commitment from nonprofit &UR;  &LR; organizations, helping lead a
nationwide fight against big tobacco, or stretching civil rights
laws to fight domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   But at other times, such as his attempt to regulate handguns
through the state's consumer protection laws, which Superior Court
Judge Diane Kottmyer just blocked, that determination has seen
Harshbarger stretch the law to the rending point, or to overreach
on problematic prosecutions, angering substantial parts of his own
party.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that's because of the moralism that informs his
politics and sometimes runs against the grain of a laissez faire
state. Just because something is not illegal doesn't mean it's OK,
Harshbarger argues.
</P>
<P>
   That moral sensibility is evident in Harshbarger's crusade
against legalized gambling, a stand that has alienated some
southeastern Massachusetts residents who hope for a casino to draw
dollars to their struggling area.
</P>
<P>
   Former US Representative Chester Atkins, who helped Harshbarger
in his early campaigns, sees a huge cultural clash between
Harshbarger's sensibilities and Massachusetts political norms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about a strait-laced minister's son,'' said
Atkins, who supports former state senator Patricia McGovern for
governor. ``I think that a lot of the grease of politics _ the
thousand little deals, the looking the other way, the cutting of
corners _ is not something he is comfortable with or tolerates.''
</P>
<P>
   It's in the area of public corruption that Harshbarger's
zealousness has earned him rancor that still dogs him as he tries
to make the transition from prosecutor to party leader.
</P>
<P>
   One person who has been unwilling to forgive and forget is no
less important a figure than US Representative J. Joseph Moakley,
dean of the Massachusetts delegation. When Harshbarger called him a
couple months ago and asked to sit down and talk, Moakley, still
seething over Harshbarger's futile attempt to prosecute former
state Attorney General Edward J. McCormack Jr., a close Moakley
friend, rebuffed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not interested in sitting down,'' Moakley told the Globe.
``I lived and died with Eddie McCormack.''
</P>
<P>
   That same prosecution so angered Harshbarger's own mentor,
former attorney general Francis X. Bellotti, that Bellotti stopped
speaking to his protege for several months, though the two have
since made up.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one joking remark Bellotti used to make to caution his
aggressive underling back when Harshbarger served as head of his
bureau of public protection has sometimes seemed prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such an activist, I used to say: `Scott, you never let
the law get in your way, ''' Bellotti recalls.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To know 56-year-old Scott Harshbarger, one must understand the
era and influences that forged his character. During Harshbarger's
days at Harvard, from 1960 to 1964, John Kennedy was in the White
House, his example of public service in every young man's mind.
</P>
<P>
   But Harshbarger was pulled by the example of an even stronger
role model: his father, Luther Harshbarger, the chaplain at Penn
State University.
</P>
<P>
   A conscientious objector in World War II with a fervent
commitment to civil rights and social justice, the elder
Harshbarger inculcated conscience in his son. Even today, the
attorney general remembers running afoul of his father almost 45
years ago, when he and his cousins went swimming in a community
pool even though the attendant had turned away a black youth
staying with the family as part of the Fresh Air Fund program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five minutes later, my dad is standing at that pool,'' said
Harshbarger, his voice rising to mark his father's outrage at that
American apartheid: ```You guys get out of that pool and over here.
That is racism. That is wrong.'''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger, like his father, is a member of the Church of the
Brethren, a religion similar to the Quakers. The denomination
doesn't have any churches in Massachusetts, and Harshbarger no
longer attends church regularly, though he does sometimes visit
other churches, such as the Morning Star Baptist Church in
Mattapan.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, Harshbarger never dreamed of following his father
into the cloth, despite meeting theologians like Martin Luther King
and Reinhold Niebuhr, whom his father brought to Penn State as
speakers and to the family home. Although his grades were very
good, he was more athlete than intellectual.
</P>
<P>
   But at Harvard, a course on the New Testament had sparked his
interest, and he applied for and won a Rockefeller Fellowship to
encourage students to try the seminary.
</P>
<P>
   The September after graduation, he, his wife, Elizabeth, whom he
had married before his senior year, and their young son, moved to
New York City, where Harshbarger went to Union Theological
Seminary, doing field work at the Chambers Memorial Baptist Church
in East Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   In a neighborhood of poor blacks and Puerto Ricans, the church
was the center of social activism, and there Harshbarger taught
Sunday school, led a Bible study group in nearby housing projects,
ran youth sports programs, and worked with gang-intervention
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the defining year of my life,'' Harshbarger recalled.
``It crystallized everything my parents had taught me: caring about
others, equal rights, equal justice, that you are supposed to act
out your values, that you have obligations to others ... that you
never, ever, ever, allow prejudice or bias to stand in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching what a committed church could accomplish, Harshbarger
could only imagine how much more government could get done. From
that experience would come some of his initiatives as district
attorney and attorney general _ programs such as his safe
neighborhood initiative, coordinating social service and law
enforcement to address the problems of the urban neighborhoods;
Operation Clean Sweep to broom low-level drug dealers out of city
neighborhoods; his fight to prevent red-lining and to promote fair
lending; and his drive to make hospitals and HMOs improve care for
community members.

 BOSTON: ... community members.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regrets over the individual effort not made would haunt him. He
and Betsy were so taken by Skeeter Dennis, a black sixth-grader in
his Sunday school class, they thought of bringing him back to the
family farm, near the town of State College, Pa. Three years later,
on a return visit, Harshbarger learned that Skeeter had died of an
overdose _ and he blamed himself for not acting on his impulse.
</P>
<P>
   The Harlem youth comes to mind, Harshbarger says, whenever he
hears someone say nothing can be done about kids and gangs and
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could have involved ourselves in the life of Skeeter
Dennis, we could have prevented a lot of tragedy,'' he said, voice
rising, gestures animated. ``That was a kid who had pure
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was back to Harvard for law school. Back, that is, to
Kennedy's clarion call of public service _ but with the values of
social justice, equal rights, and equal opportunities firmly
activated.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, he would spend several years as a private
lawyer, and several more working as a legal reformer and a public
defender. His big chance would come in January 1975, when Bellotti
hired the 33-year-old activist to run the public protection bureau,
supervising 200 attorneys charged with protecting civil rights,
consumers, and the environment, and enforcing antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   It was an assistant attorney general, where he was immediately
plunged into issues as explosive as court-ordered busing, that
Harshbarger really came into his own. ``He did an excellent job,''
said Bellotti. ``I always used to say he was my social conscience.
He had a great deal of integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   After three years with Bellotti, Harshbarger was ready to run
for office himself. In 1978 he came within three percentage points
of defeating longtime Middlesex District Attorney John Droney. Four
years later, after a stint as general counsel to the newly created
state Ethics Commission and two years in the private sector, he was
back.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Harshbarger won handily, garnering 47.5 percent of
the vote against the ailing Droney and two other Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   His record as DA, where he refocused the office's attention
toward early intervention and crime prevention, is considered
strong. But one case, the Fells Acres Day School child-abuse
prosecution that sent Gerald and Violet Amirault and Cheryl
Amirault LeFave to jail for long sentences, has been a continuing
source of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Superior Court Judge Isaac Borenstein granted Cheryl
LeFave a new trial, ruling the children had been manipulated by
overzealous prosecutors, their testimony tainted and compromised by
faulty interviewing techniques. Despite nagging doubts here and
judicial reversals in similar cases across the country, Harshbarger
remains adamant about the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe today, as I believed based on the investigation and
prosecution, that justice was done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mid-1980s also saw some personal and career troubles for
Harshbarger. After years of drifting apart, he and Betsy separated
in 1983, then divorced in 1985. (He married his second wife, Judith
Stephenson, in June 1987.)
</P>
<P>
   The next election would mark the first time Harshbarger was
thrown for a career loss. Or rather, took himself out of a game.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1986, when Bellotti announced he wouldn't run for
reelection, Harshbarger set his sights on a run for attorney
general. But only two months later, disappointed that Bellotti
wouldn't back him and rattled by headlines about his fund-raising
from his staff _ something he had criticized Droney for _ he bailed
out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   It was a decision that by some accounts led to a personal funk.
Several sources say he became only an occasional presence in the
DA's office, losing focus and energy. Said one: ``AG was the job he
had always wanted. He took it hard. It was a very deep blow. He
wasn't engaged in his job, and it took him several months to
recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says Harshbarger, who remembers he was glad to be out of
the AG's fight and back to complete his work at a job he loved.
Though his supporters were disappointed, ``I don't recall it as a
depression or feeling particularly down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if he had stumbled in 1986, he had regained his nerve by the
next election cycle. Buoyed by 1990's strong anti-incumbent
sentiment, he challenged and beat Democratic Attorney General James
Shannon, a former US representative, in a campaign devoid of real
issues beyond his claim to be a professional prosecutor to
Shannon's career politician.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In general, Harshbarger has won good grades as an activist
attorney general committed to defending the public interest, though
some complain that on issues like the tobacco settlement and
electric utility deregulation, the rhetoric ended up being stronger
than the results.
</P>
<P>
   But a recurring question has been his pursuit of public
corruption cases, where several high-profile cases have backfired.
Several long-time observers see troubling tendencies to indict on
iffy charges.
</P>
<P>
   One case that aroused rancor on Beacon Hill was his 1995
prosecution of state Senator Henri Rauschenbach, a Brewster
Republican, on influence-peddling charges. Rauschenbach was
acquitted. In February 1993, he negotiated a settlement on
conflict-of-interest charges with former Democratic state Senator
William Q. MacLean that required MacLean to repay the state
$512,000 he had received in hidden commission from state contracts.
That case also earned Harshbarger criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In May, there followed the case many think marked Harshbarger's
nadir as attorney general: his indictment of former attorney
general Edward J. McCormack Jr. on conflict-of-interest and
conspiracy charges.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general alleged that McCormack, through his
insurance company, paid $30,000 in a series of monthly installments
to Paul Fanning, then a retirement analyst in the state treasurer's
office, at a time when McCormack received pension business that
earned him a $1.8 million commission.
</P>
<P>
   That, Harshbarger said, was a clear violation of the state law.
It wasn't even a quid pro quo he had to prove: State law prohibits
anyone from giving compensation to a state employee in a matter in
which the state has an interest.
</P>
<P>
   But McCormack told a different story. Fanning had been his
partner in Pilgrim Insurance Co., his firm; McCormack said the
payments were to buy out his interest in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   After the prosecution presented its case, Superior Court Judge
Thomas E. Connolly ordered the jury to find McCormack not guilty,
ruling that the evidence prosecutors presented actually helped
prove McCormack's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Moakley says McCormack, who died in 1997 of complications from
lung cancer, &UR;  &LR; was devastated by the 17-month ordeal between
indictment and acquittal, so much so that he felt uncomfortable
visiting some of his old haunts. ``I know how much he agonized
about it,'' said Moakley. ``It really destroyed him.''
</P>
<P>
   That prosecution also led to a temporary falling out with
Bellotti, another friend of McCormack's. When pressed, a reluctant
Bellotti, who supports Harshbarger for governor, admits he was
livid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never believed Eddie had done anything wrong,'' Bellotti
said. ``I was angry about that for a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Harshbarger said he ``fully understood'' the
anger McCormack's friends feel toward him. His record, which
includes 180 public-corruption prosecutions and an 83 percent
conviction rate, is his record, he said. Harshbarger suggested it
would seem dishonest and self-serving to try to make amends after a
failed prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I say to the McCormacks, `I made a mistake,' what good does
that do to them?'' he asked. ``Their life has been affected by this
decision. We do that all the time in decisions that I make. I think
I have a responsibility to take the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   That failed prosecution, and the harm it caused, are legitimate
issues for voters to consider, Harshbarger said. But, he added,
showing a flash of anger, they should consider the rest of his
record as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the thousands of elderly people that I have
protected?'' he asked. ``What about the consumers, the
environmental cases, the civil-rights cases, the hundreds of people
who are protected from hate crimes, the thousands of victims of
domestic violence and child abuse that I have protected and stood
up for? I am proud of my record ... I have stood up for people, and
that's what I was taught to do.''

A MISCHIEVOUS VOTE IN THE HOUSE SENDS STARR A MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The day before Monica Lewinsky finally showed up
at the federal courthouse here, there was an interesting but barely
noticed vote a few blocks away in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The vote resolved not a single important question but it
revealed part of the very long political road the slim pickings
from Kenneth Starr's lengthy investigations will have to travel.
And it also suggested why Starr himself will not be the person to
lead that journey toward a goal called impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   To oversimplify, the House was playing politics that day,
believe it or not. There was an appropriations bill on the floor
and a bipartisan duo of two former subjects of prosecutorial
interest (Republican Joe McDade and Democrat John Murtha of
Pennsylvania) threw in an amendment setting up a review panel to
which people could take claims of abuse or other misbehavior by
federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, John
Conyers of Michigan, offered a mischievous amendment to the
amendment that would expand the concept to cover independent
counsels.
</P>
<P>
   As shots go, it was on the cheap side, but the ensuing debate
quickly became a gripe session about Starr. And Newt Gingrich's
lieutenants quickly began a counter-mobilization to keep
Republicans in line against Conyers. But in the end, fully 48 of
them defected, and the proposal ended up with 249 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Republicans are rather radical, antiauthority types,
bordering on the libertarian _ like Ron Paul of Texas, Dana
Rohrbacher and Elton Gallegly of California, and Joel Hefley of
Colorado. But the ranks also included Brian Bilbray of California,
John Fox and Phil English of Pennsylvania, Amo Houghton and Peter
King of New York, Frank LoBiondo and Pill Pascrell of New Jersey,
Jim Leach of Iowa, and Jim Ramstad of Minnesota. They are
deservedly called moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gingrich nor Starr was amused, and for good reason. In
case no one has noticed, Starr's investigation exists primarily in
its waning weeks as a prelude to impeachment proceedings against
President Clinton. That is the biggest of all political and
constitutional words, and also not exactly appropriate to what
remains the smallest of cases.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few weeks, while gonzo House Republicans have
received attention for confrontationalism, quiet House Republicans
have been trying to send private word to Starr about what will and
will not produce movement, sentiment that was to an extent recorded
in last week's unnoticed roll call.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's testimony, according to her camp, sought to establish
one version of a physical relationship that may or may not be
called ``sex'' by more ordinary peoplebut certainly contradicts
past statements by President Clinton. Whether there is coroboration
and what Clinton himself has to say, are for the next two weeks to
determine. But what many House Republicans are saying is that they
don't care, that they have no interest in or intentions about
moving a sex or sex-based case. A sizeable chunk is also not
interested in an alleged coverup case based more on inferences in
some Starr report than on direct, incontrovertible testimony from
witnesses or clear documents.
</P>
<P>
   And behind that, is a broad-based GOP unwillingness to move an
impeachment process into gear that requires them to do much further
investigating to establish basic facts, given all the torture the
country has already gone through this year. There is a willingess
to consider clear-cut evidence of a real crime if any is produced,
but many a wise Republican would be unwilling to spend time on a
case that is even in the slightest squishy. And that is an attitude
worthy of something as awesome as impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   As in Watergate a generation ago, it is a process that should
require _ and as a political matter does _ a genuine national
outrage over a specific act abusing the office about which there is
no reasonable dispute. Back then, it was the Saturday Night
Massacre of prosecutor Archibald Cox for the specific purpose of
withholding supoened evidence. And it took that scary event just to
get the process started.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like that exists today.
</P>
<P>
   Starr controls his grand jury and the legal process, though his
conduct is under official scrutiny, and his zeal has squandered his
political standing to generate a serious impeachment inquiry. And
in a mirror image, President Clinton faces legal machinery he
cannot really hope to disable, but it is headed toward a political
arena where his standing is far more formidable. That is why his
Aug. 17 testimony date is so critical.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this all will be about politics in the best sense,
and in part that is the message sent by those Republicans who lined
up to vote for Conyers's otherwise meaningless amendment.

CONSUMERS OFF BALANCE OVER UNSOLICITED CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Rosanne Lipe opened her mail last month and pulled out a
shiny card with a ``MasterCard'' logo, she knew something was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The accountant had not applied for a new credit card, but this
one had her full name, an account number, a magnetic strip, and
expiration dates. Issued by First USA Bank, the ``Platinum
Connect'' card is a combined MasterCard and telephone calling card,
and each feature can be activated by calling an 800 phone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never sent for this,'' Lipe said to her husband when she
saw the card.
</P>
<P>
   Recoiling at this unrequested piece of plastic, her husband,
Dick, sent us an e-mail: ``Just wondering: Is it legal to send out,
unsolicited, a combination credit card/
</P>
<P>
   calling card?''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the Lipes are part of a large consumer outcry
against these controversial cards, which have been showing up in
mailboxes throughout the country since last September. Many are
worried that these cards, so casually thrown in the mail system,
could easily get into the wrong hands. Consumer advocates also are
concerned that such unsolicited cards will cause recipients to get
deep into debt.
</P>
<P>
   Banking regulators, prosecutors and consumer advocates in
several states have questioned the legality of these cards.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits companies from sending anyone an
unsolicited credit card. You cannot even _ as First USA originally
tried to do _ send an unsolicited calling card in which the company
bills you each month. That is seen as an extension of credit.
</P>
<P>
   With some legal finesse, however, First USA officials have
modified their card to the satisfaction of federal regulators,
largely by highlighting a prepaid calling card feature, said
Anthony Ricko, section head of the compliance department at the
Federal Reserve Bank in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Ricko said the card was acceptable because it offers two
substantial services, a credit card feature, which is inactive when
mailed, and a calling card feature with a prepaid system.
</P>
<P>
   The calling card feature now requires that the consumer identify
a credit card that will, in advance, pay for all phone calls. It
could be the accompanying First USA MasterCard or VISA card, if
activated, or another credit card.
</P>
<P>
   The calling card becomes a ``stored value'' card, which always
operates in the black. For example, a customer could deposit $100
to the calling card's account, by asking First USA to bill the
credit card for that amount. All calls simply would be deducted
from that sum. When the account dwindles to nothing, additional
money must be paid for more calls to be made.
</P>
<P>
   To address security issues related to the credit card, David
Webster, spokesman for First USA, which is based in Wilmington,
Del., said the card must be activated by the consumer, so there is
no way someone could steal it and rack up huge bills. He said the
bank would not hold prospective customers liable for misuse from
theft. He said the credit card can be activated on the phone, so
the customer could use it right away.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted the 9.99 percent fixed annual percentage rate,
though the rate goes up to anywhere from 19.99 percent to 22.99
percent if you miss some payments. And calling card calls are 50
cents for the first minute and 25 cents for each additional minute,
anytime.
</P>
<P>
   As perks, the calling card also comes with 60 free minutes of
long-distance calling as a sign-up bonus. Webster said every time
the consumer ``loads'' the calling card with money, he or she
receives 10 percent of the amount in reward dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Webster didn't want to get into the details, but he said First
USA would be issuing a similar card later this month, Plantium
Supreme, that involves discounts related to gas purchases. He said
the Platinum Connect card has been ``well-received nationally,''
though he declined to say how many people have been sent the card
and how many have signed up.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Platinum Connect is legal, many consumer advocates are
not comfortable with this kind of card. They say the 60 free
minutes of calling and the easy activation of the credit card make
it too tempting for those least able to manage another credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Dowd, an attorney with the Florida attorney general's
office, said her office now is satisfied with the legality of the
card, based on current laws. Still, she believes lawmakers need to
consider different ways to protect consumers from the new tactics
of credit card marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation
of America in Washington, D.C., said he also is not happy with the
marketing tactics of this card. He noted that 80 percent of US
households have at least one card, and of those card-carrying
households, the average one has 10 credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of most households, they should be tearing up
credit cards, not getting new ones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   For travelers, there may be some lessons to be learned in the
recent arrest of a travel agent who took more than $14,000 from
customers without giving them any tickets.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, Adolph (Al) Mondele, 48, of Medford, Mass., was
arraigned on larceny charges. For the past few years, Mondele
operated International Travel and Tours, Tropical Air Services
International Inc., and other travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Mondele, who is from the new Democratic Republic of Congo
(formerly Zaire), has turned over his passport to authorities and
is currently free on $2,500 cash bail.
</P>
<P>
   Mondele's business focused largely on travelers going to foreign
destinations, particularly his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Schlaver, director of the Cambridge Consumers' Council,
said consumers must be careful in dealing with travel agencies,
which do not need to be registered in Massachusetts. He said one
way to measure an agency's reputation is by checking for any
complaints lodged with the Better Business Bureau or state attorney
general's office. Mondele had numerous complaints on file with the
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Schlaver also said Mondele ran a broker-type business, in which
he took consumers' money with the promise of obtaining cheap
tickets elsewhere. He did not issue tickets himself. Schlaver said
that practice can be a warning sign, and consumers are safest
dealing with an agency that will issue the tickets immediately
after you pay for them.

   _Dialaround glitch: Callers trying to use Telecom USA's 10321
``dialaround'' service may have found they were charged higher
rates than expected. That's because of a technical glitch that
caused them to be billed at MCI's nonsubscriber rates. (Telecom USA
is a subsidiary of MCI.) Federal officials announced last week an
agreement with Bell Atlantic and MCI to identify all consumers
overcharged by this problem, and credit them in the next several
months. If you have more questions, call MCI/Telecome USA at

AUTHOR TAKES ON SPITTING IMAGE OF ANTIWAR PROTESTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ Sociologist Jerry Lembcke had finished his
research into reports that antiwar protesters spat at Vietnam
veterans and concluded that those reports were myths, when a
workman at his house and then one of his students told him they
knew veterans who had been spat at.
</P>
<P>
   But both stories collapsed, just like all the others he had
tracked down, Lembcke said. ``An unending series of pop-up
targets,'' he called them.
</P>
<P>
   Lembcke, 55, is an associate professor of sociology at the
College of the Holy Cross and himself a Vietnam veteran, who was
drafted after the 1968 Tet Offensive and served 13 months in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the final stages of writing ``The Spitting Image:
Myth, Memory and the Legacy of Vietnam,'' published last month by
New York University Press, when he heard the two close-to-home
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   When he told the workman at his house what he was writing,
Lembcke said, the worker said that ``had happened to a lot of us.''
Not to him, ``but to guys I knew.'' Not in Worcester, though, ``but
mostly in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the space of a minute,'' Lembcke said, ``the story goes
from not `me' to someone else, and from not `here' to somewhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   His student told Lembcke he should talk to his roommate
``because his dad had been spat at.'' But it turned out it wasn't
the roommate's father, but his uncle _ and then not him, either,
but someone he had heard about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to prove something didn't happen,'' Lembcke said.
But after extensive research, ``I'm confident these things didn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   There were news reports of protesters being spat at during the
unpopular Vietnam War, Lembcke said, ``and while I don't rule out
the possibility that reporters did see protesters spitting at
soldiers and veterans and didn't report it, I think they would have
seen it as too good a story not to report.''
</P>
<P>
   Lembcke was drafted just short of his 26th birthday when his
deferment as a junior high school math teacher was canceled. After
basic training, he volunteered for training as a chaplain's
assistant and was assigned to the 41st Artillery Group, stationed
in the Central Highlands of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chaplains he worked with _ a Roman Catholic (Lembcke
was Protestant) _ started talking with Lembcke about the
righteousness of the war. By the time he returned home, he was
ready to join the Vietnam Veterans Against the War. At the
University of Northern Colorado, where he began his graduate work
in sociology, he became active in antiwar activities.
</P>
<P>
   It was the resurfacing of ``spitting-at-veterans'' stories
during the buildup to the Gulf War that prompted Lembcke to
investigate the subject. ``I saw this image being invoked by prowar
people to rally opposition to the antiwar side,'' Lembcke said.
</P>
<P>
   The image was cited in prowar letters in the Telegram &AMP; Gazette
of Worcester, Lembcke said, and one of his colleagues at Holy Cross
taped a prowar demonstrator saying that people had to support the
Gulf War ``because my brother was traumatized by the hostility he
experienced after returning from Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   What was happening, Lembcke said, was an attempt by the Bush
administration ``to discredit peace activism'' in order to build
support for the war.
</P>
<P>
   The belief that Vietnam War protesters spat at soldiers and
veterans ``began to hatch,'' Lembcke said, several years after the
war was over _ and lost. ``At that point,'' he said, ``the country
was having to learn how to deal with losing the war.'' And one way
that it did, he said, was to create the alibi that ``we did not
lose to the Vietnamese, but were betrayed by the antiwar
movement.'' And the myth of the spat-at veterans ``fits as part of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest embodiments of the ``betrayal,'' and one of
the best known, was in the 1978 film ``Coming Home.'' A key scene
is that in which Bob, a Marine captain (played by Bruce Dern), is
returning from Vietnam and is met by his wife Sally (played by Jane
Fonda).
</P>
<P>
   He asks her: ``Where's all the demonstrators?'' Someone ``on the
plane told us there would be a bunch of flowerheads out here.'' As
they drive out of the airbase, there is a small group of antiwar
demonstrators chanting, ``One, two, three, four. We don't want your
rotten war.'' One flashes the peace sign at Bob, and he responds by
saying, ``Peace on you too, brother,'' as he gives the two-fingered
victory sign, slowly letting his index finger drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality,'' Lembcke writes, ``antiwar activists approached
Vietnam returnees, if at all, with informational leaflets offering
services and inviting them to join the movement.'' But the scene in
the film ``misleads the viewer by suggesting that the animosity
displayed by antiwar demonstrators toward returning veterans leads
to Bob's downfall,'' his abuse of Sally, his paranoia, and his
eventual suicide.
</P>
<P>
   A series of films, such as ``Tracks'' and ``Go Tell the
Spartans,'' added to the belief, culminating in 1982 with ``First
Blood'' in which John Rambo, a returned Vietnam veteran (played by
Sylvester Stallone) has these lines: ``I did what I had to do to
win. But somebody wouldn't let us win. Then I came back to the
world, and I see all those maggots at the airport. Protesting me.
Spitting. Calling me baby killer, and all kinds of vile crap. Who
are they to protest me? Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   In his analysis of the cultural dimension of the spitting myth,
Lembcke expands on earlier studies of the subject, ``Homecoming,''
by journalist Bob Green, and ``Working-Class War,'' by MIT
historian Christian Appy.
</P>
<P>
   As his stance gains publicity, Lembcke is already receiving
letters, phone calls, and e-mails on whether the spitting happened.
``They're running half-and-half, agree and don't-agree'' he said.
``People are really hung up on: `Did it happen or didn't it?' But
that's the nature of myths _ you can't lay them to rest.''

GETTING IN SHAPE FROM THE INSIDE OUT

   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   Lately people are talking about Pilates, Pilates, Pilates. They
do it, want to do it, are desperate to do it, have tried and failed
to find an instructor who'll teach them how to do it. Suddenly a
physical conditioning system that has been around for more than 70
years is the exercise du jour, which rankles Martha Mason, a
certified Pilates instructor. She says she's tired of reading
``fluffy'' articles about celebrities doing Pilates. ``It's not a
fad,'' she said. ``Who cares if Madonna does it?''
</P>
<P>
   A great many people, apparently, because there's a two-year
waiting list for private instruction at the Pilates Studio in
Cambridge, Mass., where Mason and her partner, Lisa Silveira, teach
women and men of all ages. Not everyone is drawn to Pilates because
of the celebrity connection. It's an intense, gentle form of
exercise long popular with dancers but also suitable for aging
bodies, and for people with injuries and physical limitations. It
focuses on posture, alignment, flexibility, and strengthening the
``power center'' _ the stomach, lower back, and rear end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pilates is not for everyone,'' Mason said. ``It's not about
getting a perfect stomach, or getting legs that you need in LA.
It's a thinking person's exercise. You really have to concentrate.
It's not like going to the gym and working out.''
</P>
<P>
   Silveira, reached on Nantucket where she spends summers
teaching, said Pilates tends to disappoint people looking for
instant exercise gratification. ``This works from the inside out,
and it appears over time,'' she said. ``And that's not good enough
for a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason and Silveira aren't trying to discourage interest in
Pilates, but to emphasize that it requires effort and commitment.
``It's very effective if you're consistent,'' Mason said. ``I've
seen people transformed.'' Consistency involves twice-a-week
sessions. Private classes at the pilates studio are $60 each, group
classes $15 each.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Pilates called his system of 150 different exercises
Contrology, because it trained the mind to control the body.
Pilates moved to New York from his native Germany and opened a
studio in 1926. Photographs of him in his 70s and 80s show an
amazingly fit man who looked half his age. ``I drink a quart of
liquor a day, plus some beers, and smoke maybe 15 cigars,'' he
claimed in a 1964 New York Herald Tribune story. He was 83 at the
time, 5-foot-8, 170 pounds. He was still able to do a full split,
quite a feat in itself, never mind the booze, beer, and cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Only in recent years has Pilates's system attracted a large
following. Mason, who trained as a ballet dancer, spent 2 1/2 years
learning the Pilates system, a total of 600 hours as a student and
apprentice. She and Silveira are two of only a handful of certified
Pilates instructors in the Boston area. Their studio is equipped
with machines used in the Pilates system: the Cadillac, the Throne,
and the Reformer. The latter, despite its intimidating name, is a
bed-like device equipped with springs and pulleys that provide
tension during the exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Mason put me through a few beginner-level exercises on and off
the Reformer. The movements were extremely subtle and precise,
different from any exercise I've done. Mason shoved her fingers
hard into my stomach and led me through a Pilates-style sit-up,
which concentrates on the innermost layer of abdominal muscles. The
movement demanded an acute awareness of body movement and
breathing. Mason said that even people who, unlike me, are
considered fit by other standards find the Pilates exercises
difficult at first. ``I had a triathlete in here recently and he
was humbled, just humbled,'' she said, smiling.

CONSUMER GROUP QUESTIONS FOUNDATION'S INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   There is a new foundation on the block giving away money for
education, but its creation a month ago has set off alarm bells
among consumer advocates who worry that it will not have the
financial independence it needs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Nellie Mae Foundation say its endowment of $250
million makes it the largest independent foundation in the region
dedicated to making education grants. Within a few years,
foundation officials hope to give up to $10 million annually to
students _ particularly the underprivileged _ from preschool to
college levels.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, however, had a curious birth _ and some consumer
advocates fear the high hopes for its good work might not be
realized.
</P>
<P>
   They worry about the foundation's close ties to a for-profit
subsidiary, Nellie Mae Inc.: The two groups currently share office
space and some employees at the Braintree, Mass. headquarters. And
the foundation's entire endowment comes from 100 percent ownership
of the corporation's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups fear that these tight financial and personal
bonds may keep the foundation from making detached and rational
decisions necessary to protect its endowment. If the corporation's
profits are poor, for example, can the foundation cut its losses
and sell it off?
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, the for-profit will be pulling the strings for the
nonprofit,'' said Kim Comart, a consultant working for Consumers
Union, a nonprofit consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   Comart and others also say they have a right to get into the
foundation's business because they believe the $250 million
endowment, in a way, belongs to the public.
</P>
<P>
   This view goes back to the origin of the foundation. It was
created as a result of recent federal legislation allowing
nonprofit student loan companies around the country to split into
two parts. A foundation would keep the accumulated assets of the
nonprofit group and preserve them for the public good, and a
for-profit, taxable corporation would continue the loan business.
</P>
<P>
   So in the case of Nellie Mae Foundation, it kept the $250
million in assets accumulated from two related nonprofit student
loan organizations, the New England Education Loan Marketing
Corporation and Nellie Mae Inc. The assets are to be used for
philanthropy, on the theory that the money came from tax breaks and
federal subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   And the newly created for-profit, taxable corporation _ Nellie
Mae Inc. _ will resume the federal and private student loan
business. As a for-profit, it now is free of many investment
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Bell, director of Consumers Union's West Coast office in
San Francisco, said she thinks the current setup will lead to
inevitable problems. She said the foundation will be blind to the
corporation's defects. And that is a major problem when the
foundation's assets _ or, as her group sees it, the public's assets
_ are 100 percent with one company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interests of the foundation are not always in sync with
the company,'' she said. ``What happens if the company starts to
fall apart at the seams. Nobody says, `We should be selling off the
stock of the company. We should fire the top managers.' How do you
do this when you have split loyalties?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many top managers now represent both the foundation and
corporation. As a spokeswoman, Diane Saunders currently speaks to
the media for both the foundation and corporation; Larry O'Toole is
president and chief executive officer for the corporation, and also
acting president for the foundation while it seeks a permanent
head.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure public input, Consumers Union wants the foundation to
work with a community advisory board, which would nominate people
to the foundation's board.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Dooley, the new chairman of the board of the Nellie
Mae Foundation, said he wants a tight relationship with the
corporation, so board members can oversee the work of their major
investment.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism from Consumers Union is frustrating Nellie Mae
officials, who say it deflects attention from the foundation's
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out that Consumers Union is funded to investigate
nonprofit conversions, spokeswoman Saunders said, ``They have to
bark because they've been given money to bark.''

O'MEARA'S GOT THE MARK OF A CHAMPION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO _ Mark O'Meara's sister turns the key in her white Volvo
and starts to back out of her brother's spotless driveway. She
looks up and, of course, O'Meara has the Windex bottle in hand and
is cleaning the car's headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Bear Car Wash would be out of business if the world was
full of Mark O'Mearas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would never pay anyone to wash his car,'' his sister,
Leslie Malfitano, said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara believes everything should be as immaculate as Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   But while he has always been a first-class person, O'Meara did
not become a world-class golfer until recently. For 18 years,
O'Meara rambled along as a pretty good professional, winning 14 PGA
titles along the way. Then, this year at the age of 41, he became
the oldest player to claim two major championships in the same
season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if he can win the PGA Championship at Sahalee, O'Meara will
join Ben Hogan as the only other three-time major champion in the
same year.
</P>
<P>
   What turned an otherwise decent professional into a dominant
one?
</P>
<P>
   His relationship with Tiger Woods, a neighbor in their gated
Florida housing community, has been influential. Undoubtedly,
O'Meara discovered if he could beat his phenomenal friend in an
informal round, the rest of the tour was conquerable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was another factor, perhaps more important.
Sometimes, you have to hit 40 before learning that when you try too
hard, you produce very little.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara had to let it go. To decide that it would be all
right to leave a few divots in the manicured life he led. To
realize his potential, friends and family said, O'Meara needed to
realize that the car will still run if there's a smudge on the
fender.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, he wouldn't give himself permission to win if
he wasn't hitting it perfect,'' said Hank Haney, his swing coach.
</P>
<P>
   Like one of his wedge shots, Mark O'Meara has risen from
anonymity, from his childhood home at sea level in Mission Viejo to
his current standing at the pinnacle of golf. After winning the
Masters and British Open, he now soars above all of his
contemporaries, trading reluctance for moments of magnificence.
</P>
<P>
   ``By realizing it is not a life-or-death situation, you free
yourself up and you tend to play better,'' O'Meara said in a recent
telephone interview as he was preparing for Sahalee.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, while O'Meara's game is on an almost unprecedented
trajectory, his approach to life remains a contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   He resides at Isleworth, the exclusive development, suggesting
an opulent lifestyle. Shaq lives down the street. Tiger is across
the way. Ken Griffey Jr. is a good 3-wood downwind. But if you're
driving by, O'Meara is the one in the yard wearing a baseball cap,
T-shirt, shorts and his Oakley sunglasses. He's the one watering
the plants or, naturally, washing the car.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-feet and 180 pounds, you will notice he is fittingly
common. The pre-sets on his car radio are probably dialed into
classic rock, top-40 and sports talk stations. In the early '90s,
he actually liked the Pet Shop Boys.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara is not a night-on-the-town-kind-of-guy unless the NBA
Magic or the Solar Bears, a minor-league hockey team, are playing
at Orlando Arena. He enjoys skiing with his wife and their
daughter, 11, and son, 8, at Park City, Utah, or bass fishing in
the Butler chain of lakes, one of which is right off his backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just an average Joe,'' said his wife, Alicia.
</P>
<P>
   On the golf course, though, O'Meara is below par and above
average. He has won nearly $1.5 million this year, $10 million in
his career. He is entitled to hobnob _ and does _ but O'Meara would
prefer to talk with you.
</P>
<P>
   His home phone doesn't have call waiting. If O'Meara is on the
line, there will be no interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   In a 90-minute appearance on the Golf Channel after his British
Open victory at Royal Birkdale, he even answered questions from
viewers like George in Texas. He demonstrated flaws in his own
swing, right there on the set. Imagine Gary Payton discussing
fundamentals of the jump shot with some doorknob from Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because I play good golf doesn't make me much different
than any other human being,'' said O'Meara. ``I try to respect
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   If you sat across the bar from O'Meara, he could tell you why he
aims to be considerate of others. He's like his father. Bob O'Meara
grew up on Long Island and still retains his New York accent and
old-school values.
</P>
<P>
   At 69, he could retire, but continues to work in the furniture
sales business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a thing about being dependent on my son,'' Bob
O'Meara said. ``Pride is an important issue. Whatever you earn,
you've got to feel like you earned.''
</P>
<P>
   With their four children, Bob O'Meara and his wife, Nelda, moved
around the country, ricocheting like a drive into a thicket of
Douglas firs, his line of work taking the family everywhere. Along
the way, Bob O'Meara preceded Haney, becoming Mark's first golf
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   At her home in Orlando recently, Leslie Malfitano watched her
brother giving another interview on TV. She sat back with her
husband, Matt, and smiled as O'Meara recycled his modest replies in
an engaging manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in furniture sales, dad has a way with people. It's not
schmoozy, it's genuine interaction,'' Malfitano said. ``Mark is
definitely his father's son.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob O'Meara has a saying: ``Monkeys learn from other monkeys.
Just be sure you learn from the smartest monkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara was paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   He also listened to his mother. O'Meara recently recalled the
day in his youth when his mom asked him to pull weeds in the yard.
He pulled them, every single one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm done,'' he said to his mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``No you're not,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes I am. Look, they're all gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to tell you this, but I was watching,'' she said. ``You
didn't get the roots. If you don't get the roots, the weeds will
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes moms can be a tough crowd, but another lesson was
dispensed in that flowerbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That molds a person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You could say that O'Meara has never since forgotten his roots.
</P>
<P>
   He does his own planting and gardening and watering. If he is at
his parents' house and sees that they just brought home some plants
from Home Depot, he wants to plant them. Right then.
</P>
<P>
   He has always been Meticulous Mark O'Meara, a human spot
remover, and Alicia is his identical twin. You might find golf
balls in their house, but you could look forever for dust balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can eat off their garage floor,'' said Matt Malfitano,
Mark's brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara owns several cars but mostly drives a Porsche 930 turbo,
the shiny one of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see somebody's dirty car and I can't stand it,'' O'Meara
said. ``You work so hard to get the things you have, you've got to
take care of them so they last longer.''
</P>
<P>
   You get the feeling that Porsche will never die, that it will
continue to cruise like the O'Mearas' marriage of 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe in stereotypes, Alicia O'Meara appears to be a
blaring affirmation. She is the beautiful blonde with the glowing
white teeth situated greenside, waiting with satisfied smiles and
congratulatory hugs for her triumphant husband.
</P>
<P>
   But Alicia has had a bigger impact on her husband's career than
any of the bubble-shafted woods in O'Meara's bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my best friend. She makes life easy for me,'' O'Meara
said. ``The No. 1 reason I've had success is directly related to
our relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   When they met, Alicia was one of the on-course scorekeepers at a
benefit tournament in Mission Viejo featuring the musicians Seals
and Croft. She was a 17-year-old high-school senior at Dana Hills.
O'Meara was a 21-year-old senior at Long Beach State who was
playing in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to talking to her because she was an attractive girl,''
O'Meara said. ``I was totally blown away when I found out she was
only 17.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara might have been an All-American, a supposed stud in golf
circles, but Alicia was unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little older than me,'' she said. ``I was not that
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   After some prodding from her mother, Alicia agreed to go out
with O'Meara. Their first date was a Halloween costume party. It
seems they haven't been able to mask their excitement since.
</P>
<P>
   They were going to get married on Valentine's Day in 1980 but
moved it up to Dec. 20, 1979, because O'Meara was preparing for a
January start to his first year on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go at it by myself. It doesn't work, this
boyfriend-girlfriend deal,'' he said. ``I told her: `We love each
other.' And she said: `You're right, let's just get married.' Those
were great days.''
</P>
<P>
   With around $3,000 between them and most of their belongings
stuffed into Alicia's mom's garage, the newlyweds hopped into
</P>
<P>
   their Volkswagen Rabbit and went tournament-hopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a nice car,'' O'Meara said. ``Then we got an
Oldsmobile Cutlass and I thought we were really stylin'.''
</P>
<P>
   He pocketed $1,600 at his first tournament, the Bob Hope Classic
in Palm Springs, and $8,000 for an eighth-place finish at the
Phoenix Open the following week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed to be too nice to be true,'' Alicia said. ``From the
beginning, we've always had fun.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mark O'Meara there are conflicting characteristics that
simultaneously enhance and hinder his game.
</P>
<P>
   A perfectionist, he is recognized as one of the hardest-working
players on tour. And yet he has stumbled over his modest manner in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he would be a little more confident,'' Alicia said.
``He is so humble that it's held him back. That's why he's a late
bloomer. I have always tried to tell him how talented he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The self-assessments are understated. O'Meara consistently says
he is a nice player, a good player, never a great one. Great
players are named Nicklaus, Hogan, Palmer, he explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself a player that tries to do the best I can at
all times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara is comfortable being himself. ``I don't have any desire
to trade places with Tiger or Griffey or Michael Jordan,'' he said.
``I want to be a good player, a good father, a good husband and
take care of my friends. That's what my father taught me: be the
best you can be and have a normal lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   He's serious when he talks about taking care of those around
him. Just ask his brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   What's better than a stripper at your bachelor party? Nothing,
really. But consider this: at Matt Malfitano's, O'Meara played
three holes with all six threesomes at Isleworth. Then when he
spotted PING clubs in Malfitano's bag, O'Meara Federal Expressed a
new set of Taylor Mades to his brother-in-law the next day.
</P>
<P>
   After the wedding, O'Meara told his father he wanted to pay for
half of the expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meant a lot to me,'' Leslie Malfitano said. ``He didn't
tell me. To this day, we haven't talked about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, O'Meara forgets that he makes maximum wage
and others do not. When the Malfitanos' house was being built, he
thought a bigger window should be put in to take advantage of the
lake view. But the wall was already up. To change construction
plans would raise the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said: `What's the big deal, knock the wall out, put up a
new one,''' said his sister. ``It's like: `Mark, hello.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the golf course, until this year, O'Meara has largely gone
unnoticed. At the Masters, someone mistook Mark O'Meara for Mark
McCumber.
</P>
<P>
   Although he carefully avoids controversy, last September at a
PGA European Tour event in Paris, Sweden's Jarmo Sandelin accused
O'Meara of mismarking his ball on the 15th green. Sandelin _ who
lost the Trophee Lancome tournament to O'Meara by a stroke _
claimed O'Meara moved his ball a quarter-inch closer to the hole.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara argued otherwise. It was only a two-foot putt. He wrote
a rebuttal for Golf World magazine, saying: ``I'm one of the better
putters in the game; I don't need help on a putt like that.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara isn't terribly outspoken, but he also generated
criticism after suggesting that players should be paid for
participating in the Ryder Cup, the every-other-year battle between
the Americans and Europeans. A West Palm Beach writer renamed him
Mark O'Money.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the sudden prominence that has ended his
anonymity, skeptics hover. Some still call his big wins
``O'Mearacles.'' In the PGA Championship, O'Meara is listed at 18-1
by the non-believers in Las Vegas. Woods is the top choice at 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara's drives often stray and his best finish in 15 previous
PGAs was a tie for sixth at Riviera in 1995. Yet, there are
numerous reasons to invest in O'Meara. A fine putter anywhere, he
is even better on poa-annua greens like the ones at Pebble Beach,
where he has won five times, and at Sahalee.
</P>
<P>
   If he gets in position, O'Meara is known as a player who closes
the deal no matter the competition. Starting the pattern, he won
his first tournament in Milwaukee in 1984, beating Tom Watson
during his prime.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, too, that even though his hair is graying, it has
given him the distinguished look of an unflappable champion _ an
aging warrior who defies time because, in fact, he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this with 41 being old?'' asked Bob O'Meara, 69. ``He
will go there (Sahalee) with the intention of winning. He's got a
lot of wisdom because he's so old.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting some fatherly advice, O'Meara just might continue
to rewrite this year's tale of the nondescript.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, you know what, you really screwed up,'' Bob
O'Meara said. ``You won the Masters and the British Open in the
same year and the press is going to write about you no matter what.
Your picture is all over the place. You've loused up the whole
program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think I should do?'' his son asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't back off now,'' Bob O'Meara said. ``Win the PGA.''

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ My main art mission in Poland had nothing to do
with contemporary work. It was to see Leonardo's mesmerizing ``Lady
with Ermine'' in the Czar-toryski Museum in Krakow. For years I'd
daydreamed about making the pilgrimage to Poland to see the
``Lady,'' a picture that intrigued me more than the ``Mona Lisa.''
But that was just in reproduction: Would the reality be as good?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fantasy was a frisson of fear that the ``Lady''
wouldn't be in residence when I showed up. Like other cash-strapped
museums in other post-Communist countries, the Czartoryski
sometimes rents its rarities to wealthier museums in the West. The
Polish museum offered to rent ``Lady with Ermine'' to Boston's
Museum of Science for its Leonardo show last year for $1 million
for the show's six-month run. The Museum of Science declined.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was ``Lady'' on the premises the day of my visit, she
and I were the only occupants of the room where she lives. No one's
ever alone in the Louvre with the ``Mona Lisa,'' or with other
Leonardos in museums in more accessible locations than Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The serene and secretive ``Lady'' is even more enigmatic than
her more famous sister in the Louvre. While the ``Mona Lisa'' has a
detailed landscape background, ``Lady'' is set against a plain dark
ground that removes her from any specific time or place. Both she
and the ermine she cradles look off to their left. What has
captured their attention? We'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing ``Lady with Ermine'' fulfilled a fantasy. Finding the
Center for Contemporary Art in Warsaw's Ujadowski Castle was a
complete surprise. Poland was one place where I thought I was safe
from contemporary art. About the only living Polish artists I could
even name were Warsaw-born Krzysztof Wodiczko, who teaches at MIT,
and Magdalena Abakanowicz, who has become one of the most
celebrated sculptors on the international scene. Born on the
outskirts of Warsaw to an aristocratic family, Abakanowicz survived
the horrors of both the Nazis _ she saw them shoot her mother's arm
off _ and the Soviets. I'd seen her work recently in European
museums including Spain's Guggenheim Bilbao, as well as in a
temporary show at Boston College's McMullen Museum of Art and a
long-term installation at Wellesley College's Davis Museum. The
Davis piece, still on view, is chilling, and quintessentially
Abakanowicz. Called ``Iron Cage,'' it is a hollowed-out burlap
torso trapped behind rusting bars, evoking Abakanowicz's own
tortured history, humanity's as a whole _ and Poland's in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Younger Polish artists were a blank to me, though, until I
stumbled onto them in the Ujadowski, which has been home to
adventurous shows for almost a decade. The property, however, has a
far longer history, one sadly typical of Warsaw. The first building
on the site was a 13th-century stronghold of Mazovian princes,
followed by a hunting lodge, then, in the 17th century, by a
baroque castle that later served as both military barracks and
hospital. The Nazis burned the castle during the Warsaw uprising;
the Soviets finished the job later on, blowing up the remaining
walls. Like virtually all of historic Warsaw, the Ujadowski Castle
is being rebuilt with great attention to authenticity, an ongoing
process that will result in a 17th-century building that's 10 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the concierge at my hotel nor my half-Polish guide knew
about the Center for Contemporary Art, which I found while walking
in one of Warsaw's vast parks. Overgrown trees shield the view of
the Ujadowski; coming upon it is like discovering Sleeping Beauty's
bramble-covered castle. The major summer show, ``At the Time of
Writing,'' up through Sept. 13, was likewise a revelation: 13
artists, all under 40, none of whom I knew, all of more than
passing interest.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old British curator Nigel Warwick organized the
show. Warwick notes that a few years ago, Catholic forces flexed
their muscle to get Andres Serrano's notorious ``Piss Christ''
banned from a CCA exhibition. Since then, the climate has relaxed
sufficiently for Warwick to be able to show Dominik Lejman's
``Powerpray (Praying Machine),'' an exercise machine modified to
become a prie-dieu, suggesting that prayer is as routine,
repetitious, and mindless as an aerobic workout. Lejman extends the
exercise metaphor in ``Powerprayer I,'' a video of a helmet-wearing
biker, seen from above, projected on a flat surface that looks like
an abstract ``veil'' painting a la Morris Louis _ the sweaty
superimposed on the sublime.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Ewa Lowzyl's video projection looks like a large,
throbbing sun _ almost like one of Arthur Dove's painted haloed
forms come to life _ until you realize it's an eyeball, blown up to
gigantic proportions, watching you watch it.
</P>
<P>
   Piotr Jaros is the stylist and stage manager of large photos he
doesn't actually shoot himself. His ``Modern Hero'' is another sly
comment on the church and contemporary life, with a bare-chested
man sitting in a tanning machine and offering a sacramental wafer
to a second man who kneels before him.
</P>
<P>
   Mirek Kaczmarek combines the forms of futuristic furniture with
new technologies in eerily inter-active work. You sit in front of
his ``Dressing Table'' and contemplate a video that is at first
hazy, then slowly comes into focus: It's you.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasz Vetulani's paintings on sponges _ a material cheap,
readily available, and not at all durable _ suggest the ephemeral
and elegiac. His subjects in the CCA show are animals, their images
sunk into the hunks of sponge, looking like a cross between cave
painting and the horses of Susan Rothenberg.

WITH THE WORLD AT WAR, SPOKANE PROVIDED AN EMOTIONAL BOOST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. _ If the unthinkable happened, and only one major
golf tournament could be played anywhere in the world for 36
months, where would it be played?
</P>
<P>
   Augusta National? Pebble Beach? Maybe St. Andrews?
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four years ago, as World War II disrupted everyone's
lives, the choice was Manito Golf and Country Club. The game's best
available players came to Spokane to decide the 26th PGA
Championship on a short, user-friendly course well beyond the
streetcar lines on the city's south side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the great things that happened during the war,''
the legendary Byron Nelson, 86who finished second, told the
Post-Intellgencer in a recent interview. ``The PGA had that
tournament there because they realized the more they could get
before the public, the better it would be for everyone. They used
us to keep golf going.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 80th PGA Championship and all of its glitz and legions of
money-waving fans descend on the Seattle area this week, the
private Spokane club remains in the shadows, 275 miles away, not
much more than a footnote in the annals of tournament golf.
</P>
<P>
   Manito, the Algonquin Indian name for ``magical power,'' hosted
the world's only major golf tournament played between August 1942
and August 1945, when war forced the closure of several courses and
pressed most PGA Tour players into military service. And until this
year, the course was also the site of the only grand-slam event
played in the state of Washington. In what news accounts proclaimed
then as ``the most spectacular upset in the history of the
tournament,'' Bob Hamilton captured that 1944 PGA Championship by
beating Nelson 1-up in 36 holes of match play.
</P>
<P>
   Controversial at the time, Hamilton's victory remains one of the
most widely unexpected outcomes in PGA Championship history: The
archives say the Evansville, Ind., man _ who had five tour
victories in his career to Nelson's 52 _ won with his putter. But
Jimmy Shriver, a former Manito club pro and a spectator at the 1944
event, insists Hamilton did it with other means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Hamilton's unsportsmanlike conduct was unreal,'' said
Shriver. ``Whenever Nelson would get ready to putt, Hamilton would
clear his throat, anything to distract him on the greens. It was
just frightful. How in the world could a guy play golf and conduct
himself like that?''
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old Shriver, a longtime friend of Nelson's and his
personal guest at the Byron Nelson Classic in Irving, Texas, last
May, said Hamilton received a warning on the course from then-PGA
president Ed Dudley over the alleged antics.
</P>
<P>
   But, by then, Shriver said the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went on too long,'' Shriver said. ``When a guy hits you
with the first holler, you never know when you're going to get the
next one. You get gunshy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a hole-by-hole, recap, the Spokane Spokesman-Review reported
that the normally unflappable Nelson missed a two-footer on the
first hole, four-footer on No. 2 and a three-footer on the ninth
hole. Over 36 holes, with or without Hamilton's alleged
harrassment, the recap said Nelson botched nine short putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Hamilton was a pretty good player, but that was the only
tournament he won of any importance,'' said Nelson, now
86-years-old, a 10-1 betting favorite for the final round.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was of the school to do little things to keep you off
guard; nothing too bad, but just a little bit to be obnoxious. He
did little things to break up my concentration. I didn't putt
really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton is not around today to answer these charges. He died in
1990, at 74, after building a driving range and an 18-hole public
facility, the Hamilton Golf Course, in Evansville. But his son,
Jim, who runs the family-owned links, has an answer for why his
father seemed to make noises at awkward times during the final
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might have been nervous,'' the younger Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 2, 1943, just nine months before the event was held, a
brief item in the Spokesman-Review reported that the Athletic Round
Table, a collection of prominent Spokane businessmen led by Joe
Albi, had made a written bid for the PGA Championship. They offered
financial guarantees and would meet soon with PGA President Dudley,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no other mention of the major in the newspaper until
mid-February, when it was referred to as a ``scheduled'' event, as
if it was tentative. Sports sections in those days were filled with
stories about the demise of leagues, teams and events because of
the war. Consequently, hype was noticeably absent.
</P>
<P>
   After touring war-torn England, PGA tournament manager Fred
Corcoran said that he had seen putting greens and courses near
hospitals and wounded soldiers responding positively with the game
within reach. So, when there was a national cry to restore
baseball, golf and other sports to lift the spirits of the troops
and fans, it was heard in Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletic Round Table, which is still in operation today,
amassed considerable wealth by running slot machines (legally),
invested the money wisely and was big on golf. ``Back in those
days, anybody who could come up with $10,000 could have a
first-class event on the PGA Tour,'' Shriver said.
</P>
<P>
   While most cities were scrambling for war-time cash, the Lilac
City apparently had a stockpile. Albi and his peers produced a
$20,000 purse _ then the richest ever for a PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   As front-page headlines screamed of Allied victories overseas,
the showcase tournament was held in mid-August at Manito. It was
promoted as a fund-raiser for the military and the return of golf _
the other three majors wouldn't resume until 1946 _ and all
proceeds , which ultimately totaled $25,000, were pledged to the
Fort George Wright convalescent center and Baxter General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   During the tournament, 100 soldiers served as course marshals,
and three dozen wounded servicemen on crutches were brought to the
course to watch the final round.
</P>
<P>
   The only trouble was finding players. The war had pulled 410
golf pros into active duty. A field of 140 was originally
announced. It dropped to 100. Then 85. Military commitments and
transportation problems were the reasons. When the golfers finally
teed off for the first of two rounds of medal play, there were 66
entries, including eight club pros recruited from statewide courses
and a Spokane-based soldier.
</P>
<P>
   John Hoetmer is the only local pro alive today who teed it up in
Manito's major. At 85, the North Seattle man still plays nine holes
at Sand Point Country Club, three times a week. His only 1944 PGA
Championship keepsake is a white pin, with two clubs crossed, stuck
to a framed photo of him playing in the 1955 U.S. Open at San
Francisco's Olympic Club. It was handed to him in the locker room,
in an envelope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got invited because not enough guys showed up,'' Hoetmer
recalled. ``All the Northwest pros who could play and get away were
invited.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked the graveyard shift at Lake Washington Shipyards, ran
Meadowbrook Golf Course during the day and slept in between. He
remembers flying to Spokane in a prop plane with Wayne Golf Club
pro Bob Connolly, staying at the Ridpath Hotel and hitching rides
to Manito. Paying his own expenses, including a $25 entry fee, he
shot 78 and 83, and failed to qualify for match play. But he was
glad he went.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real experience,'' Hoetmer said. ``It was quite a
memorable feat for them to put that on, with what was going on.
Those were times that were really heartbreaking.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the noticeably shrunken field, Manito had headliners
in Nelson and Harold ``Jug'' McSpaden. Other notable players in the
field included: Olin Dutra, Sam Byrd, Craig Wood, Tony Manero, Tony
Penna, Jimmy Hines and Harry Cooper. Slacks, dress shirts, ties and
brimmed hats made up the standard golf wardrobe. There were no
clothing logos, no walking billboards.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was classified as 4F, unable to serve in the military,
because he was hemophiliac. Instead, his World War II obligation
centered on entertaining, not fighting, and Spokane was part of
that effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``McSpaden and I were called the `Golddust Twins,''' he said.
``We flew across the country four times in one year. We went to USO
camps and rehab camps. I made 110 appearances for the war effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Indicative of the war and its demands, some people were at
Manito just long enough to find out they were needed elsewhere. One
such person was Denny Spellecy, now 78 and a Mesa, Ariz., resident.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy enlisted man, Spellecy spent a few days on the course
moonlighting as a sportswriter for the Spokesman-Review. Military
walkie-talkie radios were a new innovation at the 1944 PGA
Championship, used to relay scores and messages, whereas previous
events had gone without. This modern convenience did Spellecy no
good at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out on the golf course and this Air Force guy with a
walkie-talkie asked if I was Spellecy, and said I had a phone
call,'' he said. ``I was told I was getting shipped out to
Hutchinson, Kansas, before the finals. I wasn't happy to see that
airman.''
</P>
<P>
   Manito, at 6,478 yards with wide fairways, smallish trees and no
water, offered little resistance off the tee. Fast greens made up
for that, taking all but the surest putters out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   Living up to their advance billing, Nelson shot a pair of 69s
and McSpaden a pair of 70s to finish 1-2 in medal play. McSpaden,
however, went down in the quarterfinal round of match play,
unexpectedly losing 2-up to Hamilton. With three lopsided
victories, including one over Tacoma's Chuck Congdon in the semis,
Nelson easily advanced to the final round.
</P>
<P>
   With 6,500 fans following them around course, Nelson and
Hamilton were even when they broke for lunch in the clubhouse after
18 holes. They were still even after 33 holes, thanks to Nelson's
continuing putting difficulties. But on the 34th hole, a 197-yard
par-3, Hamilton dropped a 30-footer coming up and over a ridge for
a birdie and the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Two holes later, on the 300-yard par-4 18th, Nelson birdied from
18 feet for a momentary tie. But Hamilton responded, sinking a
15-foot birdie putt for the win. The winner celebrated by tossing
his putter in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only good putt I remember making was on the 36th hole,''
Nelson said. ``I thought I could make one putt, and I made it.
Unfortunately for me, he made his, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jim Hamilton: ``Dad said he didn't remember the ball
hitting the putter face. It just seemed like the ball was glued to
the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   The two golfers posed for pictures, listened to long-winded
speeches and met with wounded soldiers. Hamilton, after accepting
the winner's check for $3,500, would report to the Army a week
later. Within a year, he was be back in the area, stationed at Fort
Lewis, playing exhibitions and a Seattle tour stop.
</P>
<P>
   A replica of the 1944 PGA Championship trophy sits inside the
clubhouse at Hamilton Golf Course. Framed pictures replay the
major, and his week in Spokane never strayed far from Hamilton's
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always said if it was raining in Evansville, it must be a
beautiful day in Spokane,'' Jim Hamilton said. ``He liked it out
there.''

 WARSAW, Poland; ... Susan Rothenberg.

<P>
   The artists in Warwick's show are mostly in their early 30s,
which in the West would be old for the ``emerging'' category. ``You
only graduate from art school here at 27 or so,'' the curator
explains, ``and the system is that your teacher puts his stamp on
you and it takes you several more years to find your own voice. The
training is still in figurative painting and monument making, and
there is no crossing over from one medium to another. If you're a
painter, you paint. You're supposed to express your existential
angst on canvas. Art school professors discourage students from
coming here to hear our speakers, people like (the American video
artist) Gary Hill. It's a completely hermetic system.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the artists in his show unknown in the West,
Warwick says, they're also virtually unknown in Poland, even to
each other. ``Poland is so decentralized that artists aren't known
outside their own cities,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   There's almost no commercial gallery scene here, he says. Nor
are there national art magazines with listings for different
cities, no equivalent to Art in America. Warwick says the only
place in Poland with a complete, up-to-date array of international
art magazines is the CCA library. To make the point that there
aren't any art magazines, he intentionally had the catalog for his
current show designed to look like one _ right down to glossy ads
for Philips's home media systems and Suzuki cars. It resembles the
sleek magazine affiliated with London's Tate Gallery, only the
CCA's is a one-off: There isn't money for sequels. By Western
standards, the catalog is a bargain, about $6. But, then, books _
even lavish art tomes _ are relatively cheap in Eastern Europe. So
is labor, even in the post-communist age. As a CCA curator, Warwick
earns under $200 a month, an income he supplements by teaching
English.
</P>
<P>
   How many staff members do I think the CCA has? Warwick asks me.
I guess 10, on the basis of the number a similarly scaled
contemporary space in America might employ. The answer is 100.
``It's communist overmanning,'' says Warwick. ``Anything goes
wrong, throw more people at the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Warwick, who first came to Poland on a field trip while he was a
student at London's Royal College of Art, gravitated to the country
because, he says, ``I've always been interested in how ideology
impacts culture and vice versa.'' He's spent three years traveling
all over Poland, becoming an authority on its contemporary art,
which he wants to introduce to the wider world. He travels not
because he loves Polish trains, but because of the dearth of art
magazines and the other means of disseminating images that his
Western counterparts rely on as screening devices. ``In Poland, if
you don't go to where the art is, there's no way to see it,'' he
says, mentioning that Polish artists, lacking the marketing savvy
of those in the West, don't even routinely document their work in
slides.
</P>
<P>
   The CCA, which collects and shows art by major international
figures as well as by Poles, seems poised to help shape Poland's
contemporary art scene. It's already succeeded in creating
world-class amenities in a part of the world where you can't always
count on finding a clean toilet in a museum. The center rents space
to a first-class bookshop, a fine restaurant with funky decor and a
terrace with terrific view, and a shop with a dazzling array of
contemporary Polish crafts. My favorite is a chair made entirely of
pliant twigs bunched together, some sliced off to form a contoured
seat, the rest left to form a fanlike back that suggests a rustic
throne. It's a Polish version of a cross between Appalachian twig
furniture and the corrugated cardboard chairs of Frank Gehry, who
is, by the way, of Polish extraction.
</P>
<P>
   To the casual visitor, the CCA seems to be humming along
splendidly. But, says Warwick, its future is uncertain. The
current, rather raw interiors are perfect for contemporary art, but
``I'm frightened that when the restoration of the building is
finally complete and the floors are marble, it will be offered to
someone else,'' says the curator. ``It's already been offered to
the Military Museum twice _ but they've refused to move into an
unfinished building.'' Warwick predicts the government will evict
the CCA, forcing it to move elsewhere. ``Contemporary art is
marginalized by the government,' he says, ``but that also means we
can do more, and no one notices it.''
</P>
<P>
   Freed from Soviet domination that virtually demanded lying in
public, Polish curators and art writers are making up for lost time
with a kind of candor you wouldn't find in Western art circles,
where a little-white-lie tactfulness prevails. Consider this
sentence from writer Lukasz Gorczyca in his essay in the catalog
for ``At the Time of Writing'': ``The CCA ... works on a totally
spontaneous basis while flaunting its financial problems, an
activity spiced by the curators' struggle with institutional
inertia and with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Warwick has picked up that frankness. ``People talk about
painting being dead,'' he says. ``Well, for me, sculpture is dead.
We see the world in 2-D, thanks to television. At the end of the
20th century I see no role for sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more startling is his view of Warsaw's infamous Palace of
Culture, a monster Stalinist structure inflicted on the city by the
Soviets. Everyone else I talk to loathes it, for both its symbolism
and style. But Warwick insists that ``a lot of young people love
it. I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there's constant debate in Warsaw over how to
camouflage it. A Christo-like wrap? Kudzu? A circle of even bigger
buildings to surround it? The CCA tweaked the building a few years
back, inviting American artist Jenny Holzer, the word-woman whose
truisms turn up on electronic signs and granite benches all over
the world, to put one of her phrases on a billboard in front of the
Palace of Culture. The meanings of Holzer's words are tantalizingly
slippery. That's part of their allure. It's possible to interpret
her Palace of Culture message as a creepy warning to a nation whose
artists yearn for full membership in the international art club:
``Protect Me From What I Want.''

THE UNJUST LOGIC OF SPARING MURDERERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sister Camille D'Arienzo of the Brooklyn-based Convent of Mercy
estimates that more than 10,000 people have signed her
``Declaration of Life.'' She began circulating it four years ago,
when the New York Legislature seemed ready to restore the death
penalty to the state's criminal code. Among those who have signed
the document are former Governor Mario Cuomo, actor Martin Sheen,
and Helen Prejean, the author of ``Dead Man Walking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hereby declare,'' D'Arienzo's statement reads, ``that should
I die as a result of a violent crime, I request that the person or
persons found guilty for my killing not be subject to or put in
jeopardy of the death penalty under any circumstances, no matter
how heinous their crime or how much I have suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   New York did in fact reenact a capital punishment statute. But
it has never been implemented, and the odds that it ever will be
are slim. Nothing unique about New York; the odds of any state's
imposing the death penalty are minuscule. Last year, 74 murderers
were executed in the United States, the equivalent of four-10ths of
1 percent of the number of Americans murdered.
</P>
<P>
   David Frum calculated recently in The Weekly Standard that
``committing a murder in the United States today is almost nine
times safer than being drafted during the Vietnam War.'' If you
were inducted into the military during the Johnson and Nixon years,
your odds of dying in Indochina were roughly 1 in 130. Commit
murder in this country, and you face less than 1 chance in 1,000 of
paying the ultimate penalty. ``At no point in the 20 years since
the Supreme Court reauthorized the death penalty,'' Frum notes,
``has the number of murderers executed in this country exceeded the
number of Americans killed by lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Arienzo presumably knows all that. She doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first executions'' under New York's new statute ``won't
start for another 10 years or so,'' she has said. ``I will be 72 at
the time. I won't see many but I will spend every day of the rest
of my life doing something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   She will spend every day of the rest of her life, that is,
working to help murderers live to a ripe old age. Her foremost
priority is not to prevent murder victims from dying. It is to
rescue the killers who steal those victims' lives.
</P>
<P>
   I have said it before: I cannot understand the mentality of
people like Sister D'Arienzo. Or Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the document Cuomo signed _ and had notarized and
attached to his will, yet! _ is named ``Declaration of Life.'' Its
core message is that nothing is more precious than human life. Not
even justice. Or morality. Or decency. Or the welfare of the
community. Life trumps all.
</P>
<P>
   But no civilized society can believe that and stay civilized.
Life is not the ultimate value. Otherwise no nation would send
young men to fight for honor, or against tyranny, or in defense of
freedom. Life is sacred, but some things are more sacred. And if
that is true of innocent life, how much more so is it true of
guilty life _ of those whose hands are slick with the blood of
others?
</P>
<P>
   ``We execute murderers in order to make a communal proclamation:
that murder is intolerable,'' writes David Gelernter _ a Yale
professor who was wounded when he opened a package mailed by the
Unabomer _ in the April issue of Commentary. ``A deliberate
murderer embodies evil so terrible that it defiles the community.''
Whether or not Mario Cuomo personally would want his killer killed
is beside the point. It is for the good of society that assassins
ought to die _ that we may declare, to ourselves and to the world,
that the crime of stealing life is worse than any other crime and
deserves a penalty worse than any other penalty.
</P>
<P>
   D'Arienzo's document is only a publicity gimmick. When Cuomo put
his name to it, he was doing nothing more than declaring his wish
on that day, when he was very much alive and the prospect of dying
by violence (God forbid) was mere speculation. What he would
actually wish for at the moment the murderer's knife was pressed to
his neck, neither he nor we can know in advance. And what would his
loved ones think if he were murdered? Or his friends? His
neighbors? His admirers? Cuomo cannot speak for them. He cannot say
that they would want his murderer kept alive ``no matter how
heinous their crime or how much (he had) suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   It is up to the law to speak for them _ to speak for all
grief-stricken survivors confronted with the butchery of someone
near and dear. Capital punishment says to them: We, the community,
take your loss with the utmost seriousness. We know that you are
filled with rage and pain. We know that you may cry for vengeance,
may yearn to strangle the murderer with your bare hands. You are
right to feel that way. But it is not for you to wreak retribution.
As a decent and just society, we will do it. Fairly. After due
process. In a court of a law.
</P>
<P>
   A properly drafted death penalty statute _ like those in most
American states, which are replete with safeguards against error _
proclaims insistently the preciousness of innocent life. Innocent
life. The document circulated by D'Arienzo treats murderers and
victims as interchangeable _ puts the innocent and the guilty on
the same moral plane. That is a piece of hellish perversity. If the
Bible is adamant on anything, after all, it is that murderers
should be put to death. You'd think a nun, of all people, would
know that.

CONSUMERS OFF BALANCE OVER UNSOLICITED CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Rosanne Lipe opened her mail last month and pulled out a
shiny card with a ``MasterCard'' logo, she knew something was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The accountant had not applied for a new credit card, but this
one had her full name, an account number, a magnetic strip, and
expiration dates. Issued by First USA Bank, the ``Platinum
Connect'' card is a combined MasterCard and telephone calling card,
and each feature can be activated by calling an 800 phone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never sent for this,'' Lipe said to her husband when she
saw the card.
</P>
<P>
   Recoiling at this unrequested piece of plastic, her husband,
Dick, sent us an e-mail: ``Just wondering: Is it legal to send out,
unsolicited, a combination credit card/
</P>
<P>
   calling card?''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the Lipes are part of a large consumer outcry
against these controversial cards, which have been showing up in
mailboxes throughout the country since last September. Many are
worried that these cards, so casually thrown in the mail system,
could easily get into the wrong hands. Consumer advocates also are
concerned that such unsolicited cards will cause recipients to get
deep into debt.
</P>
<P>
   Banking regulators, prosecutors and consumer advocates in
several states have questioned the legality of these cards.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits companies from sending anyone an
unsolicited credit card. You cannot even _ as First USA originally
tried to do _ send an unsolicited calling card in which the company
bills you each month. That is seen as an extension of credit.
</P>
<P>
   With some legal finesse, however, First USA officials have
modified their card to the satisfaction of federal regulators,
largely by highlighting a prepaid calling card feature, said
Anthony Ricko, section head of the compliance department at the
Federal Reserve Bank in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Ricko said the card was acceptable because it offers two
substantial services, a credit card feature, which is inactive when
mailed, and a calling card feature with a prepaid system.
</P>
<P>
   The calling card feature now requires that the consumer identify
a credit card that will, in advance, pay for all phone calls. It
could be the accompanying First USA MasterCard or VISA card, if
activated, or another credit card.
</P>
<P>
   The calling card becomes a ``stored value'' card, which always
operates in the black. For example, a customer could deposit $100
to the calling card's account, by asking First USA to bill the
credit card for that amount. All calls simply would be deducted
from that sum. When the account dwindles to nothing, additional
money must be paid for more calls to be made.
</P>
<P>
   To address security issues related to the credit card, David
Webster, spokesman for First USA, which is based in Wilmington,
Del., said the card must be activated by the consumer, so there is
no way someone could steal it and rack up huge bills. He said the
bank would not hold prospective customers liable for misuse from
theft. He said the credit card can be activated on the phone, so
the customer could use it right away.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted the 9.99 percent fixed annual percentage rate,
though the rate goes up to anywhere from 19.99 percent to 22.99
percent if you miss some payments. And calling card calls are 50
cents for the first minute and 25 cents for each additional minute,
anytime.
</P>
<P>
   As perks, the calling card also comes with 60 free minutes of
long-distance calling as a sign-up bonus. Webster said every time
the consumer ``loads'' the calling card with money, he or she
receives 10 percent of the amount in reward dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Webster didn't want to get into the details, but he said First
USA would be issuing a similar card later this month, Plantium
Supreme, that involves discounts related to gas purchases. He said
the Platinum Connect card has been ``well-received nationally,''
though he declined to say how many people have been sent the card
and how many have signed up.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Platinum Connect is legal, many consumer advocates are
not comfortable with this kind of card. They say the 60 free
minutes of calling and the easy activation of the credit card make
it too tempting for those least able to manage another credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Dowd, an attorney with the Florida attorney general's
office, said her office now is satisfied with the legality of the
card, based on current laws. Still, she believes lawmakers need to
consider different ways to protect consumers from the new tactics
of credit card marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation
of America in Washington, D.C., said he also is not happy with the
marketing tactics of this card. He noted that 80 percent of US
households have at least one card, and of those card-carrying
households, the average one has 10 credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of most households, they should be tearing up
credit cards, not getting new ones,'' he said.

<P>
   For travelers, there may be some lessons to be learned in the
recent arrest of a travel agent who took more than $14,000 from
customers without giving them any tickets.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, Adolph (Al) Mondele, 48, of Medford, Mass., was
arraigned on larceny charges. For the past few years, Mondele
operated International Travel and Tours, Tropical Air Services
International Inc., and other travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Mondele, who is from the new Democratic Republic of Congo
(formerly Zaire), has turned over his passport to authorities and
is currently free on $2,500 cash bail.
</P>
<P>
   Mondele's business focused largely on travelers going to foreign
destinations, particularly his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Schlaver, director of the Cambridge Consumers' Council,
said consumers must be careful in dealing with travel agencies,
which do not need to be registered in Massachusetts. He said one
way to measure an agency's reputation is by checking for any
complaints lodged with the Better Business Bureau or state attorney
general's office. Mondele had numerous complaints on file with the
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Schlaver also said Mondele ran a broker-type business, in which
he took consumers' money with the promise of obtaining cheap
tickets elsewhere. He did not issue tickets himself. Schlaver said
that practice can be a warning sign, and consumers are safest
dealing with an agency that will issue the tickets immediately
after you pay for them.

A MISCHIEVOUS VOTE IN THE HOUSE SENDS STARR A MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The day before Monica Lewinsky finally showed up
at the federal courthouse here, there was an interesting but barely
noticed vote a few blocks away in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The vote resolved not a single important question but it
revealed part of the very long political road the slim pickings
from Kenneth Starr's lengthy investigations will have to travel.
And it also suggested why Starr himself will not be the person to
lead that journey toward a goal called impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   To oversimplify, the House was playing politics that day,
believe it or not. There was an appropriations bill on the floor
and a bipartisan duo of two former subjects of prosecutorial
interest (Republican Joe McDade and Democrat John Murtha of
Pennsylvania) threw in an amendment setting up a review panel to
which people could take claims of abuse or other misbehavior by
federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, John
Conyers of Michigan, offered a mischievous amendment to the
amendment that would expand the concept to cover independent
counsels.
</P>
<P>
   As shots go, it was on the cheap side, but the ensuing debate
quickly became a gripe session about Starr. And Newt Gingrich's
lieutenants quickly began a counter-mobilization to keep
Republicans in line against Conyers. But in the end, fully 48 of
them defected, and the proposal ended up with 249 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Republicans are rather radical, antiauthority types,
bordering on the libertarian _ like Ron Paul of Texas, Dana
Rohrbacher and Elton Gallegly of California, and Joel Hefley of
Colorado. But the ranks also included Brian Bilbray of California,
John Fox and Phil English of Pennsylvania, Amo Houghton and Peter
King of New York, Frank LoBiondo and Pill Pascrell of New Jersey,
Jim Leach of Iowa, and Jim Ramstad of Minnesota. They are
deservedly called moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gingrich nor Starr was amused, and for good reason. In
case no one has noticed, Starr's investigation exists primarily in
its waning weeks as a prelude to impeachment proceedings against
President Clinton. That is the biggest of all political and
constitutional words, and also not exactly appropriate to what
remains the smallest of cases.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few weeks, while gonzo House Republicans have
received attention for confrontationalism, quiet House Republicans
have been trying to send private word to Starr about what will and
will not produce movement, sentiment that was to an extent recorded
in last week's unnoticed roll call.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's testimony, according to her camp, sought to establish
one version of a physical relationship that may or may not be
called ``sex'' by more ordinary peoplebut certainly contradicts
past statements by President Clinton. Whether there is coroboration
and what Clinton himself has to say, are for the next two weeks to
determine. But what many House Republicans are saying is that they
don't care, that they have no interest in or intentions about
moving a sex or sex-based case. A sizeable chunk is also not
interested in an alleged coverup case based more on inferences in
some Starr report than on direct, incontrovertible testimony from
witnesses or clear documents.
</P>
<P>
   And behind that, is a broad-based GOP unwillingness to move an
impeachment process into gear that requires them to do much further
investigating to establish basic facts, given all the torture the
country has already gone through this year. There is a willingess
to consider clear-cut evidence of a real crime if any is produced,
but many a wise Republican would be unwilling to spend time on a
case that is even in the slightest squishy. And that is an attitude
worthy of something as awesome as impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   As in Watergate a generation ago, it is a process that should
require _ and as a political matter does _ a genuine national
outrage over a specific act abusing the office about which there is
no reasonable dispute. Back then, it was the Saturday Night
Massacre of prosecutor Archibald Cox for the specific purpose of
withholding supoened evidence. And it took that scary event just to
get the process started.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like that exists today.
</P>
<P>
   Starr controls his grand jury and the legal process, though his
conduct is under official scrutiny, and his zeal has squandered his
political standing to generate a serious impeachment inquiry. And
in a mirror image, President Clinton faces legal machinery he
cannot really hope to disable, but it is headed toward a political
arena where his standing is far more formidable. That is why his
Aug. 17 testimony date is so critical.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this all will be about politics in the best sense,
and in part that is the message sent by those Republicans who lined
up to vote for Conyers's otherwise meaningless amendment.

CONSUMER GROUP QUESTIONS FOUNDATION'S INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a new foundation on the block giving away money for
education, but its creation a month ago has set off alarm bells
among consumer advocates who worry that it will not have the
financial independence it needs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Nellie Mae Foundation say its endowment of $250
million makes it the largest independent foundation in the region
dedicated to making education grants. Within a few years,
foundation officials hope to give up to $10 million annually to
students _ particularly the underprivileged _ from preschool to
college levels.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, however, had a curious birth _ and some consumer
advocates fear the high hopes for its good work might not be
realized.
</P>
<P>
   They worry about the foundation's close ties to a for-profit
subsidiary, Nellie Mae Inc.: The two groups currently share office
space and some employees at the Braintree, Mass. headquarters. And
the foundation's entire endowment comes from 100 percent ownership
of the corporation's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups fear that these tight financial and personal
bonds may keep the foundation from making detached and rational
decisions necessary to protect its endowment. If the corporation's
profits are poor, for example, can the foundation cut its losses
and sell it off?
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, the for-profit will be pulling the strings for the
nonprofit,'' said Kim Comart, a consultant working for Consumers
Union, a nonprofit consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   Comart and others also say they have a right to get into the
foundation's business because they believe the $250 million
endowment, in a way, belongs to the public.
</P>
<P>
   This view goes back to the origin of the foundation. It was
created as a result of recent federal legislation allowing
nonprofit student loan companies around the country to split into
two parts. A foundation would keep the accumulated assets of the
nonprofit group and preserve them for the public good, and a
for-profit, taxable corporation would continue the loan business.
</P>
<P>
   So in the case of Nellie Mae Foundation, it kept the $250
million in assets accumulated from two related nonprofit student
loan organizations, the New England Education Loan Marketing
Corporation and Nellie Mae Inc. The assets are to be used for
philanthropy, on the theory that the money came from tax breaks and
federal subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   And the newly created for-profit, taxable corporation _ Nellie
Mae Inc. _ will resume the federal and private student loan
business. As a for-profit, it now is free of many investment
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Bell, director of Consumers Union's West Coast office in
San Francisco, said she thinks the current setup will lead to
inevitable problems. She said the foundation will be blind to the
corporation's defects. And that is a major problem when the
foundation's assets _ or, as her group sees it, the public's assets
_ are 100 percent with one company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interests of the foundation are not always in sync with
the company,'' she said. ``What happens if the company starts to
fall apart at the seams. Nobody says, `We should be selling off the
stock of the company. We should fire the top managers.' How do you
do this when you have split loyalties?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many top managers now represent both the foundation and
corporation. As a spokeswoman, Diane Saunders currently speaks to
the media for both the foundation and corporation; Larry O'Toole is
president and chief executive officer for the corporation, and also
acting president for the foundation while it seeks a permanent
head.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure public input, Consumers Union wants the foundation to
work with a community advisory board, which would nominate people
to the foundation's board.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Dooley, the new chairman of the board of the Nellie
Mae Foundation, said he wants a tight relationship with the
corporation, so board members can oversee the work of their major
investment.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism from Consumers Union is frustrating Nellie Mae
officials, who say it deflects attention from the foundation's
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out that Consumers Union is funded to investigate
nonprofit conversions, spokeswoman Saunders said, ``They have to
bark because they've been given money to bark.''

THE COST OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It's a dangerous world out there. But what is more frightening
than the risks in everyday life is that we ignore ways to eliminate
them.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are products or laws that would go a long way toward
making us safer. But they are shunned by industries who say the
cost is too high, by politicians and bureaucrats worried about
excessive regulation _ and by individuals who play the odds.
</P>
<P>
   The products range from the inexpensive _ needles that protect
health care workers from accidental hepatitis C and HIV
contamination, or $10 valves that prevent natural gas explosions in
homes _ to the expensive, such as satellite-based systems designed
to keep trains from colliding. And the potential legislation
requiring everything from trigger locks to seat belts to life
preservers, just to name a random few, could make the world a safer
place. Yet we aren't rushing to use them, buy them, endorse them,
or enact legislation requiring them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic rule of thumb is that regardless of the prescription
_ whether it is to take your penicillin or wear your seat belts _
roughly one third of the people will do it, one third will do it
sometimes, but not on a level that is therapeutic, and one third
will blow it off,'' says Philip Levendusky, a psychologist and vice
president of network development at McLean Hospital in Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   And why are we so lax? It's partly a lack of public education,
partly the efforts of industry lobbyists who squelch safety
legislation, and partly a matter of consumers simply continuing bad
habits.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's human nature _ what Levendusky calls ``wishful
thinking, the this-isn't-going to-happen-to-me phenomena.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, as many as 1 million health care workers _ nurses,
lab technicians, paramedics, janitors, and doctors _ accidentally
stick themselves with needles. About 1,000 become infected with
hepatitis B or hepatitis C _ for which there is no cure _ or with
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing that 1 million people a year go through the
anxiety of being stuck with a needle and not knowing if it is a
death sentence,'' says Andrew Stern, president of the Service
Employees International Union, which represents about 500,000
health care workers around the country. &UR;  &LR; Safety needles cost 20 to
30 cents more than conventional needles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could stop all this for the price of a postage stamp, but
the worst sort of greed and poor government regulation prevent it.
So more people die each year from needle sticks than in coal mines
or construction sites.''
</P>
<P>
   If Stern is frustrated, so are many other safety officials. Take
the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates
aviation, marine, rail, highway, and pipeline accidents and makes
safety recommendations. Since 1990, the NTSB has produced a ``Most
Wanted'' list of recommendations that would improve safety but have
been ignored. Five items have been on the list since its origin.
Two involve train separation and natural gas line explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite systems are available to closely track trains and make
certain they do not collide. Some railroad companies have balked at
the cost of implementing such a system, but that is a red herring,
says Barry Sweedler, the NTSB's director of the Office of Safety
Recommendations and Accomplishments. The close monitoring of train
movements such a system would require, would also create great
efficiencies in track and rolling stock use, proponents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year there are train accidents where trains are going too
fast, or going where they are not supposed to go, and there needs
to be a firm commitment from the industry to do this,'' Sweedler
says. ``There are pilot programs here and there but there is still
no commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Burlington Northern Santa Fe is one railroad testing the system,
but has not yet decided to use it. A spokesman said that for the
system to be truly effective it would have to extend beyond BNSF
locomotives to all of the rail industry. And railroad officials say
in a few more years, the equipment will be less expensive than it
is now.
</P>
<P>
   Cost is certainly no obstacle for a device called an excess flow
valve, which prevents gas from building up in a house if a service
line is ruptured.
</P>
<P>
   While it can be costly to put the device in existing homes, the
NTSB recommends them for every new or replaced line, but the
federal government refuses to require them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had some horrendous accidents that this device would
have prevented _ nursing homes, schools, and homes _ and it is so
cheap that there is no reason not to have it,'' Sweedler says.
</P>
<P>
   After years of debate, the Department of Transportation ruled
customers with new gas lines will have to be made aware of the
device by utility companies. Most gas companies do not routinely
use them and Boston Gas is no exception. ``They have an
intermittent performance record and they are not part of our
installations right now,'' says spokesman Mike Connors.

 UNDATED: ... Mike Connors.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But John McGowan, president of UMAC Inc., a manufacturer of the
valves, says they are extremely reliable. In 20 years, only 30
times has a valve shut off service when there was no ruptured line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like most safety issues,'' McGowan says. ``People tend
to be reactive rather than proactive. It's only when they have a
problem that they tend to focus on what to do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it is a matter of grudging acceptance developed over
years.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, members of the lunatic fringe were the ones
who wore bicycle helmets. Now, the strange ones are the bare-headed
riders. Why then, don't we routinely wear life jackets when we go
boating?
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the US Coast Guard in Boston released a study of
drownings in the Northeast and found nearly 90 percent of drowning
victims in New England, New York, and New Jersey in the first seven
months of 1998 were not wearing life jackets, or personal flotation
devices. Those figures mirror national statistics. In 1996, 500
people drowned while boating; of that number, 440 were not wearing
life jackets, or personal flotation devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps people think the life jackets are like the ones they
remember from 20 or 30 years ago that were uncomfortable and
bulky,'' says Senior Chief Petty Officer Glenn Rosenholm. ``But
there are lots of comfortable PFDs that offer great freedom of
movement and they can make all the difference in saving your
life.''
</P>
<P>
   While there has never been a law in Massachusetts requiring
adults to wear life jackets, we did have a seat belt law. We saw it
repealed, reinstated, vetoed by a governor (William F. Weld) for
libertarian reasons, and then the veto overridden. The
Massachusetts law _ unlike those in many states _ does not allow
police to stop motorists for not wearing seat belts. Only if a
motorist is stopped for some other traffic violation and is not
using a seat belt can he be ticketed for that offense.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative roller coaster, and the watered-down form of the
bill, may help explain why only Arkansas, Mississippi, and North
Dakota have lower seat-belt usage than Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using a seat belt is the single most imporant thing someone
can do to protect themselves, and Massachusetts has one of the
lowest rates of usage in the country,'' says Chuck Hurley,
executive director of public affairs for the National Safety
Council. In Massachusetts, only 53 percent of &UR;  &LR; drivers and
front-seat passengers use seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Why don't more of us buckle up?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an admission of vulnerability, that an accident could
happen to you,'' says Hurley. ``The highest-risk people, teenagers
and drunk drivers, have the lowest belt use.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that involves government intervention is inherently
controversial, and people, generally, are not looking for more for
government to do. On the other hand, the best way to save lives is
through government intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what does it take for government or business to enact
safety recommendations? Consider the following:
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, an American Airlines jet made an emergency landing in
Nashville because mislabeled toxic chemicals reacted on board,
creating heat and fumes in the passenger compartment. Although no
one was seriously injured, the NTSB quickly recommended the
installation of fire detection and suppression systems in cargo
holds of commercial jets.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the FAA thought it was a good idea, NTSB staffers
recalled. But after meeting with industry groups, the FAA came back
in 1993 and said the proposal would be too expensive to install and
maintain and rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on May 11, 1996, a ValuJet DC-9 heading from Miami to
Atlanta crashed in the Everglades killing all 110 people on board.
The fire, which probably started before the plane took off, was
undetected until it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that is most frustrating in this business,'' says
Sweedler, ``is when we respond to a tragedy, spend a lot of time
and effort to find out what happened. We find out, make
recommendations and the recommendations do not get implemented and
the same thing happens again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   After ValuJet, the detection and suppression systems no longer
cost too much. They are now required in all commercial jets. But
the price for the industry's epiphany was 110 lives.
</P>
<P>
   On many safety questions, advocates are doing the public
education work that some say should be the work of the government.
For example, tomorrow, hundreds of people will gather in Washington
for a conference on health care worker safety and blood borne
diseases in the workplace. Needle sticks and so-called ``sharps''
will be a prime topic.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, the SEIU president, says large purchasing groups, which
buy in bulk for hospitals, prevent the more expensive safe needles
from gaining market share, a charge the purchasing groups deny.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Becton Dickinson, the New Jersy-based company that
has about 70 percent of the hypodermic needle market, says safer
needles cost more. ``With the increased pressure of managed care,
every cost is looked at with tremendous scrutiny,'' says Bill Kozy,
president of worldwide injection system for Becton Dickinson,
noting that the price of safe needles would drop considerably if
more were purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, each time a health care worker is accidentally
stuck with a needle, testing cost and prophylactic drug treatment
cost anywhere from $1,000 to $2,500. Those costs would vanish with
safe needles. Says Kozy, ``We have been very much frustrated by
this penny-wise, pound-foolish approach.''

KIDDIE POOLS HELP KEEP THINGS COOL WHEN TEMPERATURES RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.H. _ When temperatures soar, it's great to be able to
cool off. Especially in water.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry if you don't have a traditional swimming pool: Space
permitting, try a kiddie pool, or as it's more commonly called, a
wading pool. They fit just about anywhere and require little water.
</P>
<P>
   Always choose a pool with safety in mind, without sharp edges or
a slippery bottom. Make sure the pool is sturdy enough that a child
can hold onto the sides to pull themselves up without the sides
sagging inwards. Soft sides are considered safer for toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   There are inflatable kiddie pools, ones made of sturdy plastic,
which can be filled with an air hand pump, and molded polypropylene
pools with rigid sides. Sizes vary, with most 16 inches deep, with
a 45-inch or 60-inch diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Most kiddie pools feature a themed, patterned design for the
interior and exterior, such as fish, animals or favorite cartoon
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Kiddie pools are also a favorite for adults, who use them on
rooftops or decks. They can also be filled with ice to keep party
beverages cool, or to bathe the family dog.
</P>
<P>
   When the weather turns cooler and it's no longer needed as a
pool, it can be filled with sand to use as a sandbox, before going
into winter storage.
</P>
<P>
   If storage space is limited, consider an inflatable pool, which
can be deflated and rolled or folded up and tucked away in a
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the pools are shallow to an adult, you must still
take care with a child and never leave them alone by the pool. A
child can drown in as little as 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Always secure a filled pool when not in use with fencing, a
sturdy safe cover or to be on the safe side, simply empty it. Never
situate your pool where it can be punctured. Placing it on grass or
sand is recommended.
</P>
<P>
   A 45-inch-diameter laminate pool costs approximately $7.50; the
60-inch laminate, around $11.50. Prices may vary, depending on the
materials and construction. Inflatable pools can cost anywhere from
$5 to $70 or more.

RENO FIGHTS BACK AFTER CITATION FOR CONTEMPT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno is said to harbor a
``Thelma and Louise'' fantasy: Jump in the car, drive across
America, and leave behind those who have made her life so
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the dream of freedom, to turn in the keys to her
rented apartment, cancel her newspaper subscription, and bid
farewell to her fierce loyalists in the Justice Department, was
only that, as a House committee cited Reno for contempt of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, Reno stood tall. She refused to turn over
confidential memos subpoenaed by Representative Dan Burton, the
Indiana Republican who chairs the House Government Reform and
Oversight Committee and who is determined to use whatever muscle it
takes to make Reno name an independent counsel to investigate
alleged Democratic fund-raising abuses in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I try to do is to make sure I don't let the
pressure push me over backward or push me over forward,'' Reno told
reporters last week, acknowledging how hard it has been, buffeted
by the political crosswinds, to keep on course during her five
years as attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Reno has emerged as the role model for character,
sobriety, and steel under pressure in an embattled Clinton
administration that did not even want her around in a second term.
She would not resign, and the president was afraid to fire a woman
who likes to say ``the buck stops here.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno has named seven independent counsels to investigate
allegations of various crimes by high administration officials, and
she allowed Kenneth W. Starr to widen his Whitewater probe to the
sex scandal that now threatens Clinton. But it is her stubborn
reluctance to appoint an outside counsel for campaign fund-raising
abuses that has the attorney general on the hot seat now.
</P>
<P>
   Editorial pages scream she is misguided, Republicans blast her
as a partisan tool, and Washington insiders say she is naive and a
little weird. Unlike other attorneys general, she is no crony of
the president _ long ago she was shut out by his tight circle of
male advisers _ and she hasn't learned to pal around with the Right
People or schmooze on the cocktail circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's her un-Washington ways, and the ways she stands up to
Washington, that have won over many Americans. White House
officials regard her as the most respected and admired member of
the Clinton Cabinet. ``My mother loves her,'' said a former Reno
deputy at the Justice Department, ``because she isn't scared of the
bullies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more Dan Burton attacks her, the more credible Reno
looks,'' said Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the
Brookings Institution. ``The public sees her as a nonpolitical
straight-shooter who is no friend of the president's.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hampton, editor of the Miami Herald, has known Reno for more
than 20 years. Reno grew up in the Everglades on a wild piece of
land where peacocks roamed and was the state's attorney in
Florida's Dade County from 1978 until 1993, when she came to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising that people inside the Beltway would call
Reno weird, because integrity is weird to them,'' Hampton said.
``She is the soul of integrity, and she embodies, along with her
dedication to the law, a kind of rugged individualism that we don't
see among urban people very often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to believe that her view not to appoint an
independent counsel is incorrect, but I would never ascribe to her
partisan motives,'' Hampton said. ``I've known her too well for too
long. She believes she is acting on her best interpretation of the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's resistance puzzles people who have supported her
no-nonsense approach to law enforcement. Some say she is willfully
disregarding the law. Others think she has simply dug in her heels
and has been deaf to advice that the politically charged campaign
fund-raising case is too hot for the Justice Department to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Reno runs the risk of appearing that she is just
stonewalling on the issue, and that could harm her legacy,'' said
Don Simon, executive vice president of Common Cause, a
public-interest group that has called for an independent counsel
since October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Reno says Americans understand what Washington doesn't: She must
stand on principle, both in her reading of the independent counsel
law and in her defiance of a congressional subpoena for internal
Justice Department memos. Disclosing the documents, she said in
three separate news conferences last week, would have a ``dramatic
and adverse'' effect on the cases Justice Department lawyers are
trying to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply have to draw the line and stand up for what I believe
to be a very important principle: Prosecutions in America must be
free of political influence,'' Reno said Thursday after the
Republican-led House committee, divided along party lines, voted to
cite her for contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Lewis, the White House communications director, said, ``My
sense is that that people think of her as someone who is honest,
principled, and does not duck hard decisions. That's character. She
is just so straightforward, plain-spoken, human, and unadorned _
everything that people wish Washington was more of.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno may be the genuine article, as her aides insist, but she is
also savvy enough to have cultivated the image.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: Reno is so straight that she has become one of the most
popular targets for Jay Leno and David Letterman jokes and
``Saturday Night Live'' skits. Reno is so painfully plain-spoken
that her weekly news conferences are mocked as never-say-anything
sessions. Reno is so unadorned that her simple haircut is now
featured on a Web site, where the style is superimposed on the
heads of Demi Moore, Courtney Love, and Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Reno, not doing the usual Washington spin is the greatest
spin of all,'' said John Hogan, who went to work for her in 1979
and was the attorney general's chief of staff until May. ``The fact
that she is who she is, doesn't pussyfoot around, and calls it like
she sees it is exactly what America wants in its public figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Klayman, chairman of Judicial Watch, a private government
watchdog group, says the public has bought into the Reno lore,
believing that she is apolitical when in fact she won elections
five times in Florida to be state's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet Reno is a tremendous actress. She comes across like Jack
Webb in `Dragnet,' the sincere cop who commands authority and has
an imposing presence,'' Klayman said. ``In reality, she is a
politician of the highest magnitude who has been co-opted by the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reno seems an odd one to become the first Cabinet officer
in history to be cited for contempt of Congress. Few think the
committee's recommendation will actually come to a vote in the full
House. Reno said she will try to reach some accommodation with
Congress on the subpoena, and she has hinted that she may call for
an independent counsel on the fund-raising issue before lawmakers
return in September.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of a nasty fight that could produce a contempt
citation and criminal penalties doesn't faze the attorney general,
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's handling it with the same amazing cool that comes forth
in every crisis,'' said Kent Markus, who, until Friday, was Reno's
deputy chief of staff. ``She knows exactly what is happening, she's
confident and comfortable ... that she is doing the right thing,
and she just doesn't care what others think about her.''

AFRICAN BLASTS PUT OTHER CRISES ON BACK BURNER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Nairobi and Dar es Salaam terrorist attacks on
American embassies have made allied intervention against the Serbs
in Kosovo less likely in the near future and have put off yet
another showdown with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb blasts probably also mean there will reduced U.S.
pressure for the time being on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to cede control of additional West Bank territory to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Few governments find it easy to deal simultaneously with more
than one major foreign crisis. This is especially true of the U.S.
government, which depends to such a large extent on popular support
at home for its foreign policy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has to remind President Clinton that Americans will now
have little interest in cracking down on Serb leader Slobodan
Milosevic over his repression of the Albanians in Kosovo or even in
twisting the arm of Iraq's Saddam Hussein violating United Nations
sanctions stemming from the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The U.S.
public's concern has shifted. People are burning with anger over
last Friday's bombings, which have so far killed at least 210 and
injured more than 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if it turned that Saddam played a role, no matter how
indirect, in the terrorist assaults, the situation would be
instantly transformed. There would be an almost irresistible demand
in the United States to eliminate the Iraqi strongman once and for
all by force.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a long shot. As in past terrorist outrages of a
similar kind, it may take months, perhaps years, to piece together
what happened and identify those responsible. Or the whole thing
could remain a mystery as suspects are eliminated one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Each time a big terrorist outrage occurs, the authorities
announce that they ``will not rest'' until the culprits are
apprehended. We've all learned by now that this is mostly rhetoric
and doesn't necessarily mean much.
</P>
<P>
   As fury at the bombings begins fading with the passage of time,
the Clinton administration and the public will, naturally, turn
their attention to other issues. Yet the twin blasts are likely to
leave an imprint on U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, U.S. officials had been getting tougher with
Netanyahu over his intransigence at making further territorial
concessions to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. But rightly
or wrongly, Clinton may be less willing to put pressure on the
Israelis as long as Islamic groups remain the prime suspects in the
African assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and those close to him aren't being accused of
involvement. On the other hand, some analysts already claim that if
Netanyahu had been more flexible in negotiations with the
Palestinians, the bombings might not have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the suspicion of a Middle East link will
inevitably improve Netanyahu's standing and lessen good will toward
Arafat among many U.S. officials and lawmakers as well as the
public.

CLIMATE DEBATE HEATS UP WITH THE WEATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the heat finally broke last week, temperatures had topped
100 degrees in Texas for a withering 29 straight days, leaving more
than 100 people dead. Only weeks before, drought-fueled wildfires
in Florida burned more than 750 square miles and hundreds of
buildings, the worst fires in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   New Englanders have felt the heat this year, too, getting an
unprecedented break from the usual winter cold. Boston residents
traded snow shovels for T-shirts on March 31 as the mercury reached
a record 89 degrees. Overall, the region's temperatures for January
through June were the warmest ever for that period.
</P>
<P>
   This year is shaping up as the hottest in the planet's 120-year
weather record, after a decade the National Center for Atmospheric
Research believes was the warmest in 600 years. Now, scientists and
politicians are locked in an increasingly hot debate over what, if
anything, all the weird weather means.
</P>
<P>
   While the massive El Nino weather disturbance in the Pacific
Ocean gets much of the attention for the various droughts, heat
waves, and floods this year, some leading climate scientists and
the Clinton Administration suspect that we also may be witnessing
the onset of human-induced global warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hottest June on record. Withering heat in Texas and
Florida. Cities that are setting thousand-year records for high
temperatures,'' mused Vice President Al Gore last month. ``How much
more proof do we need that global warming is real?''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists chided Gore, saying he was jumping to
conclusions. Though surface temperatures have risen by 1 degree
Fahrenheit since 1900 _ and nine of the 11 warmest years have come
since 1986 _ researchers are divided over how much of the heat can
be blamed on human releases of ``greenhouse gases'' from tailpipes,
power plants, and deforestation.
</P>
<P>
   But Rob Quayle, chief of the federal Global Climate Lab in
Asheville, N.C., said the vice president may have a point. His
agency expects even modest global warming to be accompanied by a
significant increase in severe weather and temperature extremes,
something that has happened in past warming trends.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, whose agency has the world's largest collection of
weather data, said a drought like the one in Texas becomes far more
likely with just a small increase in average temperatures. Global
warming, he said, could turn it from ``a rare once or twice in a
lifetime event to every four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers believe warmer air temperatures may have
strengthened this year's El Nino, a warming of the tropical Pacific
Ocean that delivered the warmest and wettest winter in US weather
history. The El Nino that finally ended in May was one of the most
potent on record. At least two climate models suggest that is a
reflection of global warming.
</P>
<P>
   But other researchers believe that talk of global warming is
premature at the least, hogwash at worst. Scientific research into
the way slight temperature increases affect localized weather is
still in its infancy, they point out, and historical research has
found only modest changes in weather patterns this century.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Balling, a climate researcher at Arizona State University
who is skeptical of global warming claims, said the weather today
is no more extreme than it ever was. It's just that politicians
such as Gore have conditioned people to see global warming in every
hot spell, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing occurring right now which is even remotely out
of the ordinary,'' said Balling. ``I can find you every day of the
year something that's happening worldwide that is `the worst in 100
years.'''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy comes at a pivotal time in the broader debate
over global warming, as the Clinton Administration attempts to sell
a hostile Congress on an international treaty to limit emissions of
carbon dioxide, a ``greenhouse gas'' that tends to trap heat in the
atmosphere. So far, Clinton has had little success, as some House
members attempt to roll back programs to combat global warming that
are already in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say a beast when cornered becomes more violent, and I
think legislators who do the bidding of polluters become aggressive
when cornered with the reality that the pollution must be cleaned
up,'' said Katie McGinty, White House adviser on environmental
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Global warming skeptics are just as vitriolic, accusing the
White House of sensationalizing bad weather to advance their
agenda. The conservative National Review last week featured a
likeness of a grim, black-suited Gore on its cover under the
headline ``Al Gore's Bogus Global Warming Crusade.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the ideological sparring lies a profound question:
Have humans changed the very weather of the planet?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists increasingly agree that carbon dioxide and other
heat-trapping gases from human activity have had at least some
impact on the temperature. Though high profile skeptics challenge
the finding, the 2,500-scientist Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change may have come the closest to a scientific consensus in 1995
with this statement:
</P>
<P>
   ``The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence
on global climate.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, officials at the National Climatic Data Center
suggested that even the modest amount of warming that has occurred
to date could alter weather patterns, increasing the ``frequency or
severity of (weather) extremes.''
</P>
<P>
   The center's senior scientist, Thomas R. Karl, explained to
environmental ministers from leading industrial nations in Miami
that greenhouse gases prevent warmth on the Earth's surface from
dissipating into space _ a phenomenon that translates into higher
temperatures, but also more evaporation of water, which can mean
drier conditions in some places and more storms elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The number of storms with at least two inches of precipitation
has increased markedly in the United States in the last century, he
said. ``It now seems probable,'' he explained, according to Karl's
notes posted on the Internet, that ``human beings have succeeded in
achieving a momentous and unwanted accomplishment: inadvertent
alteration of the planet's climate.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, other climate modellers challenged Karl's finding,
noting that the US Geological Survey has found no increase in
flooding that would match a supposed rise in rainfall. They also
noted that the frequency of other extremes, such as hurricanes and
Midwestern heat waves, have either stayed the same or decreased.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not entering a world of increased variability,
unpredictability, and peril, but rather the opposite,'' Patrick
Michaels, a global warming skeptic at the University of Virginia
and a senior fellow at the conservative Cato Institute, told a
congressional committee last month.
</P>
<P>
   But the powerful El Nino that began in April 1997 has made many
people wonder if the weather has gone haywire. From the 10 inches
of rain that hit Los Angeles in one 24-hour stretch to the ice
storms that paralyzed northern New England, to the worst drought in
Texas in 104 years, the weather of 1998 has seemed &UR;  &LR; downright
bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   Not only were the first six months of 1998 the warmest in the
surface-temerpature record, but weather satellites positioned above
the Earth showed a sudden spike in temperatures, too.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Sierra Club published a poster last month that
included 30 extreme weather events in the United States over the
past year, to support its argument that ``global warming has
begun.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Trenberth, head of the climate analysis section at the
National Center for Atmospheric Research, says the Sierra Club may
be right. El Ninos have been more frequent, longer and more
powerful since 1976, and the 1997-98 El Nino was the strongest ever
by several measures.
</P>
<P>
   It appears, he wrote in an article recently submitted to a
science journal for publication ``that something else is going on
and influencing El Nino, and the main thing we can point to is
global warming.'' Separately, researchers at the Max Planck
Institute in Germany and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration have drawn similar conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   However, scientific understanding of the weather remains
limited; for instance, most computer models of the climate don't
account for the powerful effect of the ocean on weather. Moreover,
there are few answers for why global warming would suddenly become
a weather factor now even though the buildup of greenhouse gases
has been going on for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many climate researchers aren't ready to give
global warming credit for 1998's odd weather. Gerald North,
chairman of the meteorology department at Texas A&AMP;M, said the best
explanation for the Texas drought remains the most direct one: a
high pressure mass of air that has hovered above the region for
weeks, preventing rain and even the formation of clouds to provide
shade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a subscriber to the theory of global warming,'' said
North, a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
the group that found humans may be warming the planet. ``But I'm
not buying everything.''
</P>
<P>
   And, meteorologists say, the weird weather is expected to
continue. The National Weather Service predicts above-average
tropical storms and hurricanes in the North Atlantic from now until
November because of another odd weather phenomenon, an unusual
cooling of the Pacific Ocean called La Nina.
</P>
<P>
   ``People from coast to coast are saying the weather is crazy,
and they're right,'' said Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club.

MOZART GIVES RATS IN MAZE AN EDGE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Humans aren't the only mammals who benefit from the famous
``Mozart effect'' _ better performance on certain intelligence
tests after listening to the 18th-century composer's music. So do
rats.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers who demonstrated the Mozart effect in
preschoolers and college students have now found that rats raised
in a nightly sound bath of a Mozart piano sonata (K. 448) learned
to run mazes faster and with fewer errors compared to genetically
identical animals exposed to the repetitive contemporary music of
Philip Glass, or to contentless ``white noise.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Mozart-exposed rodents ran the maze in 35
seconds on average, compared to 50 seconds for the ones who
listened to Glass and 44 seconds to the white noise group. They
also learned the right route through the maze faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work has strong implications for education and enrichment
programs, and can potentially inform scientists about the relative
contributions of biology and experience to human intelligence,''
Frances H. Rauscher and her colleagues at the University of
Wisconsin write in the July Neurological Research.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery adds to an accumulating body of evidence
indicating that the brain is ``wired'' to respond to music _ at
least some music _ and that there is overlap between brain areas
specialized for music perception and those that carry out spatial
tasks. Exercising these areas with music, it appears, carries over
in better performance on tests of spatial ability.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier tests with college students, those who listened to
the same Mozart sonata scored higher on spatial intelligence tests
but the effect lasted only 10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A separate set of experiments with pre-schoolers showed that
those with musical training scored higher on spatial tests than
those with other kinds of training or no training. In that case,
musical training had somewhat longer-lasting effects. George
Governor Zell Miller is so taken with the ``Mozart effect'' that he
proposed earlier this year that the state send a classical-music
tape or CD to the home of every new-born child.
</P>
<P>
   But the rats, which were exposed to Mozart in utero and every
night for the first 60 days of their life, apparently had changes
in their neural machinery that persisted hours after their last
dose of Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   One scientist familiar with the work, Gordon Shaw of the
University of California at Irvine, said it suggests that certain
kinds of music ``may be tapping into the internal neural structure
of the cortex,'' the gray matter in mammals' brains where thinking
takes place.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was delighted by the unexpected finding that rats have at
least some of the neural equipment to respond to complex music.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the curiosity of the finding, it opens up a realm of
animal experiments that could lead scientists to understand the
brain mechanisms that underlie both music perception and spatial
reasoning _ a cognitive ability involved in such diverse fields as
mathematics, architecture, visual arts, and navigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ethics prohibit researchers from putting electrodes into humans'
brains to discover what neurons ``light up'' when listening to
music or performing spatial tasks. But they could probe an animal's
brain to see what neurons fire while it is exposed to music or
running a maze.
</P>
<P>
   Rauscher's discovery of the Mozart effect has created a small
industry of authors and consultants trying to sell ambitious
parents on the benefits of exposing their tots _ or even fetuses _
to the master's music. But Shaw, who collaborated in the early
experiments, said the researchers never meant to suggest that
Mozart's music was somehow uniquely beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We initially picked Mozart because, composing at the age of
three, he would write down whole pieces of music without changing a
note,'' Shaw said. ``We figured if anyone was exploring that
natural inherent mechanism in the brain, it might be Mozart. But I
have a post-doctoral fellow who is very anxious to try this with
other classical composers.''

LUTHER VANDROSS BROADENS HIS RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perennial Grammy god Luther Vandross was just called the ``Frank
Sinatra of R&AMP;B'' in Billboard magazine. It's a term of endearment
that he cherishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it. I couldn't have loved anything more, because it
implies longevity,'' Vandross says of the Si-natra comparison. ``It
implies a standard that's hard to keep or measure up to. It implies
a whole lot and I like that. I like that metaphor.''
</P>
<P>
   For Vandross fans, there's more to like on his 14th album, ``I
Know,'' which comes out Tuesday. He again displays his impeccably
smooth voice in a broadening range of R&AMP;B and pop, accompanied by
guests Stevie Wonder, Cassandra Wilson, and rapper Guru of Gang
Starr. He also lets his guard down more than usual to share
personal memories of his Harlem childhood, about singing on the
stoop and harmonizing with friends.
</P>
<P>
   These experiences are recalled in ``Nights in Harlem,'' which
also is being released as a single to urban radio. It splices
together funk, rap, and soul, with the usual Vandross polish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to write a song about the fun we used to have,''
says Vandross. ``I mean, we used to sing in the streets and in the
hallways at school. You know how teachers usually say, `Cut off
that noise and go to class'? We didn't have that. Our teachers used
to listen and close their eyes and just groove, because we really
sounded good. And when the song was over, they'd clap and then say,
`Hurry up and go to your class before the bell rings.' So we kind
of knew we were good, even back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Vandross came from a musical family. One of his two sisters,
Pat, was the only woman in the vocal group the Crests, which scored
a nationwide hit with ``Sixteen Candles.'' Says Vandross: ``They
used to rehearse in my living room when I was very young. I used to
disturb the rehearsals and my sister would yell, `Mama, would you
come and get him, please, and make him stop.'''
</P>
<P>
   Vandross didn't stop. And the rest is R&AMP;B history. In the past
10 years, his hits have included ``Power of Love,'' ``Don't Wanna
Be a Fool,'' ``Here and Now'' (a popular wedding song), and
``Endless Love,'' a duet with Mariah Carey that went to No. 2 on
the pop charts in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He has become, arguably, the most sophisticated R&AMP;B singer in
the market; an identity that developed early, when he moved from
street-corner harmonies to the more complex influences of '60s acts
on the Motown label.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doo-wop stuff had that 1-4-5 chord progression and you got
a lot of songs out of that same chord progression,'' says Vandross.
``Then along came the Shirelles songs and certainly early Motown,
where no two songs were alike. So we used to sing that stuff and
then, Lord knows, Aretha (Franklin) and Dionne Warwick came into
the picture and the standard for everything just stopped and
elevated. It was like an elevator that goes from the second floor
to the 17th floor in one jump. Then you had to really understand
about texture and tone and the effect you're having on the
listener. When you're young, who cares what the listener thinks,
you know? You're just doing what you know how to do. But, after a
while, it was, `Oooh, we're getting a reaction from what we're
doing, so let's do more of it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Vandross has now attained such legendary status that he can put
the word out and get virtually any guest that he desires on his
records. That's what happened with recruiting acclaimed jazz singer
Cassandra Wilson on the new ballad, ``I'm Only Human.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to have a female voice do the chorus chant in
that song,'' he notes. ``I was saying, `Well, what about Cassandra
Wilson?' I knew she doesn't make many guest appearances and
certainly not in this genre of music. But we got her in there and
she kept saying, `This is different than anything I've ever sung.
This is such a different way to approach music.' So I took that as
a big positive, because it was a challenge for her and she did it
so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Stevie Wonder for the title track, ``I Know,'' was
another coup. It's the first single from the album to be sent to
Top 40 radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how there's a 16-bar section in the middle between
the bridge and the last chorus? That's especially true in a
commercial format, and one thing we wanted to do with `I Know' was
make sure it was commercial. A harmonica solo seemed like a great
way to do that. So who else could we call but Stevie? He came right
on in. He's just so soulful. It's just so unspoken with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album means even more to Vandross because it's his first
since switching to a new label (Virgin Records) and the first in
which he's had complete creative control _ something he didn't have
at his former label, Epic Records, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Virgin reps) showed up in the studio and said encouraging
things that really made a wonderful difference in how I felt about
recording,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   In the upcoming months, Vandross will star in a PBS special with
Patti LaBelle and then start touring, likely overseas first, before
gigging domestically.
</P>

   ``I learned a big lesson once when I was on tour with Anita
Baker,'' he says. ``She had released an album Sept. 28 and mine had
been released Sept. 30, because we were both trying to beat that
Grammy deadline, which was Sept. 30. But our first show was Oct. 1
in Washington, D.C. Consequently, all the rehearsing for the six or
seven new songs you're going to do live was really ill-advised
because people didn't yet recognize the new songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I realized we were out there too soon. So this time I want
to tour off of the second or third single on the album. I think
we're going to go abroad first and then come back to what we hope
is a successful album and tour back here.''

KAATERSKILL FALLS 
By Allegra Goodman 
Dial. 324 pp. $23.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Allegra Goodman escorted us to the seders and weddings and
impromptu dramas of ``The Family Markowitz'' (1996), you could
almost smell the fresh challah and old memories contained in those
Markowitz dining rooms. The story collection was of such comic
charm, such piercing authenticity, that Goodman's portraits of a
three-tiered Jewish family had the hues and echoes of a young Grace
Paley. Her patriarchs were old leftists who refused to pay taxes;
her desultory sons were assimilated scholars, or Anglophile
aesthetes who worked for Laura Ashley. The brick and mortar of
these stories was their laconic dialogue, capturing decades of
humor and regret in a moment's worth of words. Take Rose, the
elegantly inelegant matriarch, who is arguing with her son about
her financial portfolio days after her second husband's death.
``She stands up and clutches the back of her chair. `I don't want a
happier life,' she says with great conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman has taken that fecundity of insights about the human
condition to much wider fields in her first novel, which depicts a
panoply of characters _ most of them Orthodox Jews _ in their
summer and winter communities in upstate New York and Washington
Heights. Spanning several seasons in the mid-1970s, ``Kaaterskill
Falls'' is a carefully wrought architecture of a particularly
insulated world: one where the women play badminton in long woolen
skirts (when they play at all), where a son can be cruelly
condemned by his rabbinical father for traveling on the Sabbath.
The slow, languorous rhythms of the novel mirror the intensity of
the internal lives it portrays, whether a devoted man's daily
prayers or his wife's steadfast yearning to find a creative path
within the strictures of her faith.
</P>
<P>
   Admirably rich in nuance and detail, ``Kaaterskill Falls'' sets
out to compose an entire tapestry, and certainly in its gradually
realized world of interrelated friends and neighbors, it succeeds.
But where Goodman's stories were steeped in irony and acumen, her
novel seems intent upon cautionary gravitas. Where ``The Family
Markowitz'' was agile and laconic, relying on its dialogue for
character appraisal, ``Kaaterskill Falls'' is somber and sometimes
pedantic, instructing us infinitely about a character's failings or
strengths or glimpses of despair. The problems with the book are
common to first novels, but they are also problems that can only
befall a gifted writer _ errors of too much care, rather than too
little.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of Goodman's world are the contrasting characters
of Isaac Shulman and Andras Melish. Isaac is a member of the
separatist Orthodox community of the Kirshners, Andras an older,
successful importer who has tried to discard God along with his
memories of the Holocaust. The men leave the work of the city
behind them each week when they carpool together to Kaaterskill;
this is a novel about the interstices of faith and culture, not the
labor done outside the home to put food on the table. Accordingly,
such insularity hovers over the rest of the characters: Elizabeth,
Isaac's wife and the mother of their five children (all, to his
quiet regret, daughters); Nina, the beautiful Argentinian woman
Andras has married, but cannot seem to love; Rav Kirshner, the
aging rabbi who is succumbing to Parkinson's and trying to decide
which of his sons _ the brilliant renegade, Jeremy, or the earnest
plodder, Isaiah _ will succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Cloistered in another way entirely are the year-rounders of
Kaaterskill, who together display a range of reactions toward the
Kirshners from anti-Semitic arrogance to bemused tolerance. Most
potentially compelling is an old woman Andras stumbles upon in the
woods one day; a famous but reclusive nature photographer, she
inadvertently instructs him in his own fear of death. There's also
the wonderfully wild Syrian girl, Stephanie, who takes Andras's
daughter under her wing with the wish to make her fly. Both
characters disappear too soon (and, for structural purposes, too
abruptly), but they're indicative of a strain in the novel of
secular freedom _ the outsiders who challenge their tamer
counterparts to reach for their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   This rebellion generally takes a fairly muted form: Dear
Elizabeth, whose faith and motherhood have eclipsed her aesthetic
yearnings, ventures quietly into the world of business; Andras,
whose terrible past has numbed his heart, has to learn how to
outlive his memories. Jeremy and Isaiah, attending to their
father's death, have their own legacies and battles to wage, but
the real leaps will be left to the children _ journeys through
libraries and the bravery handed them by parental love that will
send them out into the world. One of the finer elements of
``Kaaterskill Falls'' is its attention to children as fully formed
characters _ a quality so obvious that you don't realize its
absence in most novels this densely populated until you applaud it
here. The children are the hope and bedrock of these families, and
consequently of the story itself: The religious instruction and the
piano lessons and the inevitable frustrations of childhood will
take them into uncharted lands.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet dignity of Goodman's novel is its real strength, for
in her impeccable depiction of the Kirshner community, she has
wrought an entire world. And for all its seclusion, it is hardly a
world without compromise; even Rav Kirshner privately mourns what
his followers have lost, which is the beauty of a rich, prewar
European Jewish culture without horror or vigilance. Such moments
of revelation are the most moving parts of ``Kaaterskill Falls,''
but they are elliptical _ the unspoken tragedies that govern this
milieu, even if they're scarcely recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, though, some of the sorrows of this novel are so muted
that I often couldn't tell if they were Goodman's intentionally
delivered losses, or my own interpretation of them as such. As a
modern, non-Jewish woman, I both rue Elizabeth's narrow path and
also cringe at my reaction to it: How can I understand the joys or
the constrictions of such a rigorous, devout life? There are many
ways in which ``Kaaterskill Falls'' is a novel of lamentation _
grieving the same things as the Rav _ but its striving toward
empathic regard is so painstaking, so careful, that it nearly
overshadows its authorial viewpoint. Goodman has taken her
considerable humanity and her literary skills and visited them upon
this exquisitely limned landscape, which is above all a novel with
mercy at its center. But whether she meant to or not, she has
imbued that story with an undertow of ambivalence and subdued
despair.

PETE'S ALL RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What, you may wonder, is the Who's Pete Townshend doing out on
the road this summer?
</P>
<P>
   The Who's glorious ``Quadro-phenia'' revival ran its course last
year. Townshend has been beavering away at his autobiography;
singer Roger Daltrey, his bandmate, jokes that it's taking so long
they're calling it ``War and Pete.'' Townshend hasn't put out a new
album since ``Psychoderelict'' in 1993. He has cashed a lot of
``Tommy''-related checks for the Tony Award-winning Broadway show.
</P>
<P>
   Townshend's surprise appearance this summer has to do with
wanting to atone for his behavior at Woodstock in 1969, when he
cursed out stage-crashing provocateur Abbie Hoffman and knocked him
off the stage. It has something to do with feeling those creative
juices surging again. But there is no short answer with Townshend,
perhaps rock 'n' roll's reigning, and most self-critical,
philosopher-king.
</P>
<P>
   How self-critical?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think perhaps being in a band that fails ultimately, the way
that the Who failed in the end,'' he says, ``(due to) circumstances
out of their control, maybe, clouded the way that I looked at my
career and my music.''
</P>
<P>
   The Who as a ``failure.'' This, he says, is a comment directed
at their last two, lukewarm studio albums, ``It's Hard'' and ``Face
Dances.'' But here is how Townshend's current kick start came
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a short period about six weeks ago to make the trip
over to work with my editor in New York,'' says Townshend, from his
London studio. ``I went and did that work, working on a whole new
set of chapter headings, sorting out research material for the rest
of the book. I'm still working on it very hard, and enjoying doing
it, although, dear God ... it's very hard work. But ... what
writing this book is doing for me is actually releasing all kinds
of musical creative juices, which it would be crazy for me to try
to bury. So to some extent, this (tour) is something that I decided
to do to take time out and release some of that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just three dates: Friday at Harborlights in Boston; the
next day at Woodstock, N.Y.; and Sunday a benefit in Chicago for a
children's orphanage, Maryville Academy. (He will also appear on
``Late Night with David Letterman'' Thursday.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last couple of years,'' the 53-year-old Townshend
continues, ``I've done a whole series of solo performances which
have been experimental and small. I think Danny Socolof, who's
involved in the Woodstock show, saw me up in New York's Supper Club
(playing a small show), and I think that's the kind of place that I
occupy. That's the kind of performance that I'm doing. I work very
much in my own private little place. But suddenly it (the music)
seems to be empowered, and I think empowered partly by the fact
that as I write about my childhood, as I write about my years at
art school, some of which involves going and talking to the people
that taught me, and talking to people that I grew up with, finding
that actually I was very, very smart. ... I'm at a different stage
in my life. I'm older, and I'm upright in a different way, and I
think I've been surprised at just how excited I've actually found
the whole business of coming back to my own work and to writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm doing at the moment is ... everything that I want to
do. I mean, it's the most extraordinary time in my life. I really
feel like I'm in the middle of my life, and very much at the center
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the day of atonement. The Woodstock Music and
Arts Festival is remembered as the apotheosis of the hippie era:
peace, love, and left-wing politics all bound together in one
muddy, huggy package. Townshend, more skeptical and cynical,
whacked Hoffman off the the stage. His stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've always been extremely angry about Woodstock,''
says Townshend. ``I've been kind of quite bitchy and sneering. And
I think it's time that I grew up.''
</P>
<P>
   Issue a mea culpa?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   But wasn't a young Townshend ticked off for pretty good reasons?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's OK (to say),'' suggests Townshend, ``but you know
what then happens is the years pass and I failed to acknowledge
that because I was the dissenting voice, and there were 1 million
people there, and one of them had a rotten time, that's been the
voice that has been heard loudest. And I think where I am today, I
look back and I think that I learned something vital, and I
experienced something vital, and my career took a vital turn there.
And the Who's career took a vital turn there. It's a good time for
me to go and stand on that lawn again.''
</P>
<P>
   What will happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there will certainly be an Aristotelian debate which I
may conduct on the stage if anybody's prepared to put up with it. I
think it would be worthwhile, wouldn't it? Talking about what
happened at the time. It wasn't just that I argued with Abbie
Hoffman. I also argued with Mike Wadleigh, who was the director of
the movie. Despite the fact that I kicked him in the head, he went
on to cut a very exciting and dynamic piece of footage. I don't
think I was wrong particularly. I think it would be wrong for me to
say I was wrong. I'm not trying to reverse what it was that I said,
or take back what I said. What has happened for me is I look back
and I think actually Woodstock was not the beginning or the end of
a dream. I mean I found myself kind of thinking and talking about
(the fact) that Woodstock was kind of an end of an era. But I don't
think that that's right. Given enough distance, it was a moment
when we all, and by this I mean the English performers but mainly
the American performers and the American audience, realized that it
was OK to be who they were. It was OK to be Americans. It was OK to
be young Americans, that there were 1 million of us, and we weren't
even trying and there were 1 million of us. It was unnecessary to
shout and scream and stamp our feet. We were in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish that I had not handled it as I did. When I look back at
(Hoffman's) life, I feel sorry for him. It's a strange feeling to
have for such a kind of spunky, crazy, dynamic kind of guy, but you
know he faded with, what's the word, with his obsolescence of that
whole mood, the function of that kind of revolutionary instrument
the Chicago group was supposed to represent. We had that (movement)
in the UK too. But when we realized, after Woodstock, all of us,
that we didn't need revolution because if there was going to be any
revolution, we would only overthrow ourselves. We were in our early
20s. Some of us were in our late 20s. We were already running the
(expletive) country, or we were well on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is the attitude Townshend hopes to bring with him to
America. ``I feel immensely potent. I think it's coming from a
certain sense of certainty,'' he says. ``That I have a right to be
who I am. And I mean I know that sounds ... obvious, but for an
artist this is an extraordinary thing to feel, because a necessary
qualification for an artist is to have a huge ego, and absolutely
no self-esteem. And I think what you actually do is inject into
that melange of confusion a sense of certainty about any attributes
that you have; they become barbed and superpowerful. And I think
that I've got a great trust of, not just my performing and musical
ability, but my understanding of my craft.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Townshend won't bring to the stage in the coming
week: a drummer and a bassist. Townshend was inspired by seeing new
pal Bob Mould (Husker Du, Sugar) play dynamic solo shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I got from this was complete freedom,'' Townshend says.
``The freedom to, as an artist, play wherever I like, whenever I
like. And for there to be no vanity involved _ in other words, I
wouldn't lose money. When I went out with a tour like
`Psychoderelict' and I got sponsorship and Tommy Hilfiger gave me a
couple of hundred thousand dollars, but I still lost $400,000, I
came back and I thought, we had a lot of fun, but the price was too
high. I don't want to feel like I'm paying people to come and see
me play. So, I'm trying to adjust the way that I perform to the
scale of the audience that I can reach these days, to the numbers
of people that not only want to come and see me but that I can
reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Townshend will play selections from various phases of the Who's
history and his own solo career. He says he has no plans to
emphasize or de-emphasize hits. He does suggest ``Won't Get Fooled
Again'' should sound quite sprightly with a jew's-harp replacing
the synthesizer lines.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be joined by keyboardist-guitarist-singer Jon Carin (a
former touring musician with Pink Floyd), Boston-area native Jody
Linscott on percussion, bassist Sherman Sean, harmonica player
Peter Hope-Evans, and singer-guitarist Tracey Langran.
</P>
<P>
   As to Townshend? Well, the old hearing-impaired gent who shunned
electric guitar during most of the ``Quadrophenia'' show will pick
up the electric ax here. ``I've actually found a new, quite small
Fender amplifier that they discontinued for a while. It's got kind
of an old-fashioned mismatched sound, but that's working very well
for me onstage. It's not too loud, and it I play a fair bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Townshend, of course, is aware of how rock careers tend to
flatten out creatively as the aging process takes its toll. ``I see
it in my peers, and, of course, I've experieced it as well,'' he
says. ``It's not so much just that one's creativity perhaps levels
off _ maybe that's not what happens. I think what happens if that
we lose sight of the magical chemistry of serving the masses. And I
think, God, how did that happen? Simply, I suppose, because of
music moving to stadiums. Because the people there were denied the
`collective unconsciousness' that happens in the performance of any
art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if the person on the stage is living in any kind
of fantastical bubble, there's a problem, too. In other words, if
they're surrounded with enough yes men, they end up in kind of
Michael Jackson-land.''
</P>
<P>
   What, then, is the pop artist's role?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're meant to be the bunch of flowers that's on the table
for today until you replace them with new ones,'' says Townshend.
``In pop we don't ask much, but what we do ask is that we are
served, in the passing moment, we are served by the music and the
artists that we hear. In the world of pop, what we want is solace
and we want it now; we want cheer and we want it now; we want
self-forgetfulness and we want it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Who is Pete Townshend? ``I'm a generic celebrity. It's like I
bring myself and my history to the stage. So what's interesting now
about going to Woodstock is that I'm grasping all that stuff
head-on. And I've mismanaged it terribly in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, he gets another shot.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In the mail from the American Dairy Association
we find sunburn remedies and other medicinal uses for milk and milk
products. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ To ease sun-reddened skin, fill a quart jar with equal parts
milk and ice and two tablespoonfuls of salt. Soak a washcloth in
the mixture and apply to the affected area for 15 minutes, three or
four times a day. For sunburn on the face, apply a mask of sour
cream or yogurt for 20 minutes, which soothes the burn and, as a
bonus, makes pores appear smaller.
</P>
<P>
   _ The itch from poison ivy or poison oak can be lessened
quickly, if medication is not immediately available, by soaking the
area in milk or covering with a cloth dunked in milk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, for the inside as well as the outside: Warm milk
actually does help you fall asleep, because it contains tryptophan,
an amino acid that increases the amount of the neurotransmitter
serotonin in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ARE VW GOLF CARTS NEXT?
</P>
<P>
   Here is further proof of how much times have changed: golf club
covers that resemble the Dead's mascot, the dancing bears. Price:
$40 for three.
</P>
<P>
   We can't imagine a genuine Deadhead going golfing; Deadheads are
not duffers. In 1969, a Deadhead might have earned some bread by
driving the tractor that sweeps up golf balls on a driving range.
Not nowadays, though. Nowadays you can get, also from the Command
Performance catalog, two tickets to Jerry Garcia's final concerts,
in July 1995, encased in a plastic frame and suitable for mounting
on the wall. Price: $90 for two. Order either or both from Command
Performance by calling 800-873-8263.

</P>
<P>
   Now your disposable coffee cup can wear Thinsulate, too. Coffee
bars are slowly catching on to the idea of sliding cardboard
sleeves onto their paper or plastic-foam takeout cups to prevent
scorched fingers. Now you can have your own, permanent java jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Koffee Kompanions, as a Kolorado kompany kalls itself, makes
fabric sleeves, lined with Thinsulate, that fit 12- to 20-ounce
to-go cups. The fabric absorbs drips, the insulation protects
fingers and keeps liquids hot or cold longer, and you can simply
rinse the sleeve or toss it in the washing machine. The sleeves,
available in a variety of patterns, including sheet music, roses,
sports equipment, bagels and coffee sacks, cost about $7 apiece,
including shipping. For info or to order, call 719-594-9679 or

SUMMER OF DELIVERANCE 
A Memoir of Father and Son 
By Christopher Dickey. Simon &AMP; Schuster. 287 pp. Illustrated. $24. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until now, perhaps, few would have thought to pair John Cheever
and James Dickey as literary twins. Cheever, the mordant chronicler
of suburban WASP angst, was principally a master of the short
story, whereas Dickey was a poet by trade, and a superb one, as
well as a swaggering, bare-chested Southern man of letters. The
private Cheever came to be identified with dogs and tweed jackets,
cold martinis and frozen skating ponds. Dickey preferred to
surround himself with guitars, hunting knives, bows, and canoes _
props calculated to burnish his image (of which he was keenly
conscious) as a slightly menacing good ol' boy drunk on equal
measures Faulkner, moonshine, and machismo.
</P>
<P>
   What the two men turn out to have in common, however, goes
beyond their National Book Awards and contributions to the pages of
The New Yorker, the magazine that helped build their reputations.
Each also wrote a breakthrough novel in his 40s that irrevocably
reshaped his career. Cheever's coup was ``The Wapshot Scandal,''
which when published in 1957 confirmed the suspicion that his
genius was not limited to the short-story genre. In 1970, Dickey
produced ``Deliverance,'' a savage, novel-length tale of four
suburban men navigating the backwaters and backwoods of rural
Georgia. The book was made into a popular _ and even more savage _
movie a year later, catapulting Dickey to widespread fame and the
covers of several national magazines.
</P>
<P>
   And the parallels hardly end there. Cheever and Dickey both took
their families to Italy at pivotal moments in their careers, where
each would recharge his creative batteries and, momentarily at
least, escape whatever private demons pursued him. Both Dickey and
Cheever were prodigiously self-destructive alcoholics and, to be
charitable about it, marginally functional family men. Cheever
veered off into bisexuality, Dickey into compulsive womanizing (he
once claimed to have bedded a thousand women), yet the carnage
visited on wives and children is depressingly the same; while
Cheever's marriage managed somehow to survive, Dickey's first wife
apparently drank herself to death in despair over her husband's
many affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, both writers produced offspring who grew up to be
writers themselves and who, in the shadows of their fathers'
deaths, memorialized the relationship in memoirs that separated
truth from fiction, man from myth. Susan Cheever's ``Home Before
Dark'' shocked a lot of Cheever readers when it appeared in 1984,
two years after her father died. Christopher Dickey's ``Summer of
Deliverance,'' which appears less than two years after James
Dickey's passing, may not have the same shock value, but only
because the Era of Pathography is firmly upon us. Or,
alternatively, because many of us who followed Dickey's career
reasonably closely have less reason to be surprised. (I heard
Dickey read publicly on two occasions: at Harvard in 1970, when he
was drunk enough to make you notice his behavior more than his
verse; and in Washington, D.C., in 1977, at President Carter's
pre-inaugural soiree at the Kennedy Center, an event described
briefly in this book, which to this day remains one of the most
breathtaking displays of public inebriation I have ever witnessed.)
Christopher Dickey's is certainly as unsparing and honest a book as
Susan Cheever's, with a similarly uplifting message of redemption
and reconciliation. Dickey, the Paris bureau chief for Newsweek, is
also a crackerjack reporter and savvy writer _ his previous books
include a novel and two volumes of war reportage _ who in no sense
is unequal to this difficult and psychologically delicate task.
</P>
<P>
   The book opens in 1994, with James Dickey severely ill from
alcoholic hepatitis, a disease with a mortality rate of 80 percent.
Father and son have barely seen or spoken to each other in 20
years. It has been two decades as well since Maxine Dickey, Chris's
mother, died. Within weeks of her death, Dickey had remarried, to a
much younger woman with whom he later had a daughter. His two sons
read about the wedding in People magazine. Fury at his father and
competition with his legacy have driven Chris, the older son, to
seek peace among the world's hottest war zones: El Salvador,
Nicaragua, Lebanon. His father's second wife, Deborah, is lost in a
war zone of her own, one consisting of drug addiction and mental
illness. There is evidence that she has brutally assaulted her
husband on more than one occasion. Into this Dante-esque setup
wanders the prodigal son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that I could save my father's life,'' Chris Dickey
writes, having found the poet frail but sober and nursing a
powerful thirst to live. ``We both saw that we had been given this
tremendous gift: the chance to set everything right.''
</P>
<P>
   From that departure point, the two undertake a remarkable
journey together back through time and memory. The opening chapters
jump-cut cinematically between biography and memoir, a fitting
device not only because James Dickey loved movies but because he
also liked to embellish his own resume (the decorated World War II
radar operator, for instance, insisted on passing himself off as a
decorated fighter pilot). From his early struggles as a poet and
teacher, and having cut short a burgeoning career as an advertising
copywriter, Dickey makes his mark with dazzling collections of
verse like ``Buckdancer's Choice'' and ``Helmets.'' Then comes
``Deliverance,'' and everything disreputable about Dickey _ the
drinking, the boorish narcissism, the petty cruelties _ become
magnified by the lens of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Dickey had not made this movie, he had let it make
him,'' the son observes, having worked as an extra on the set
alongside director John Boorman and the film's stars, Burt
Reynolds, Jon Voight, and Ned Beatty.
</P>
<P>
   Although shooed off the set by Boorman, James Dickey returns to
play a memorable cameo as a small-town sheriff. During the filming,
meanwhile, a series of disasters and near-tragedies befell the cast
and crew. It was, Chris Dickey writes, ``like the whole film was
becoming some kind of macho gamble in which each man was out to
prove he could take the risks the characters were running,
characters that James Dickey had only imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Deliverance'' was a turning point for both Dickeys, the son
suggests. Chris, who married when he was 18, began living a ``pale,
strained imitation'' of his father's life, drinking heavily and
conducting what he calls ``guilt-ridden affairs.'' His father's
adulteries became more brazen, his own marriage more transparently
a sham. By 1977, Chris had left his wife and found a new home at
The Washington Post. The more distance he put between himself and
his father, the more he found his own richly expressive voice.
</P>
<P>
   It is a voice put to fine use in ``Summer of Deliverance,'' as
unsentimental a father-son memoir as one can imagine. James Dickey
may have died a broken man, but he fixed something important before
he died. He was given a tremendous opportunity to get at least one
thing right. By the evidence of this book, he succeeded, too.

MARKET CAN HELP INFLATION-PROOF A RETIREMENT FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are 57 and 53. I make $77,000 a year and she
earns $100,000. We would like to retire in three years and have a
retirement income of $6,000 per month. We have checked with Social
Security and both of us will be qualified for benefits at nearly
the highest level. With the information below, how close can we
come to achieving our goal? We own three houses, worth $315,000,
$95,000 and $82,000; we have four mutual fund accounts totaling
$159,500. We have two late-model cars worth $30,000, and I own
$200,000 worth of S stock in the small company where I work, which
can take out over a 10-year-period.
</P>
<P>
   N.B., Beaverton, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This is going to be a little iffy, since some of the values
appear (at least to me) to be imprecise. But one things does seems
clear to me -- you re pretty far away from a comfortable retirement
along the lines you propose. If we add up all of your assets
(except the cars, which as you know represent a fast- depreciating
asset,) I come up with a grand total of $851,500. Since you wouldn
t be eligible for Social Security until two years after you retire,
and your wife not until three years after that, let s start with
what it takes to generate a $72,000 annual income stream. If we
presume a 6.5 percent income stream from a retirement portfolio,
the number would be a little more than $1.1 million. Now of course
you might decide that you wouldn t need quite that much, since you
could dip into principal in the early years of retirement and then
begin rebuilding your savings after Social Security kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   But there s also the question of that S corporation stock. Does
the stock pay dividends? Or would your sale simply represent a
contract under which you were entitled to $20,000 a year for 10
years, or perhaps $1,666 a month. If such is the case you might,
with the sale of some of the real estate, be able to work out a
plan to take you through those 10 years -- but at that point your
finances would fall off the table.
</P>
<P>
   Here s where I end up: If you were to sell the two lesser-valued
real estate parcels and add the proceeds to your current mutual
fund portfolio, the total would be $336,500 -- enough, if invested
in a fixed-income portfolio, to produce $1,822 a month. If you were
to use your $1,666 a month from your company stock for living
expenses during the first two years, that would mean withdrawals of
$4,333 a month from that pool, and your principal would fall to
$271,115 by the time your Social Security kicked in. Let s suppose
that during the next three years you were to then cut withdrawals
to $2,733 a month. The result is that by the time your wife s
Social Security eligibility begins you would be down to $219,449 in
principal and you would have used up half of the money from your
company stock. It s a position from which you would not recover.
You might manage to stay near that $6,000 monthly level for the
next five years, but when the last payment from the company stock
arrived, you d be cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Blacker still, none of these calculations take inflation into
consideration. A rough rule of thumb is that a people have a nice
degree of financial security in retirement if they have two sides
ing expenses, and a $275,000 growth portfolio designed to protect
you from inflation in later years.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry to be such a grouch, but at bottom the only advice I can
propose is, first, to save like mad until you do retire, and
second, consider whether you might not be better off in the long
run if you deferred retirement a few more years than you now plan.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I m 64, single, and retired last year. I have pensions from
two companies totaling $23,000 a year and $12,000 from Social
Security. My IRAs consist of $100,000 in Fidelity Growth and Income
fund, $50,000 in a Fidelity money market fund,, and $50,000 in a CD
currently paying 5.75 percent. Non-IRA investments consist of
$25,000 in AARP Capital Growth fund $50,000 in AARP Growth and
Income, and $25,000 in a CD paying 6.08 percent. The pension and
Social Security money currently provides for all my needs, and
income from investments is reinvested, with the occasional
withdrawal for overseas travel.
</P>
<P>
   However, the pensions are fixed, and buying power will suffer in
the event of inflation. Further, I have reservations about the bull
market continuing. I had consisted selling Fidelity Growth and
Income and the AARP funds and buying bond funds, but this would
leave me paying capital gains taxes on the AARP funds. What do you
suggest?
</P>
<P>
   B.H., Palm Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I can understand your nervousness about the market, but I
think you may be going too far. As a recent retiree, one of your
major concerns should be protecting yourself against the ravages of
inflation in the later years of your retirement, and unless you
have a terrific amount of money, the stock market is certainly the
best bet. If you were to move most of the $100,000 of IRA money
that s now in Fidelity Growth and Income fund to the fixed- income
side, the two AARP stock funds would represent only 25 percent of
your retirement savings, and especially since you re not counting
on any of these savings for a day-to-day income stream, I suggest
you stay put with them. One reason for this is that it s almost
impossible to time the market; if you get out now and you re like
most investors, you ll probably mis-time your re-entry, and the
worst part of such mis-timing is that people tend to come in too
late, missing the first few heady days or weeks of the next bull
market.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason, of course, is that I assume you hate paying
taxes as much as the rest of us do, and there s no way to exit from
the two AARP holdings without tax consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Notice that I suggested you move most of the money from Fidelity
Growth and Income. As I m sure you know, that excellent fund is now
closed to new investors; therefore I suggest you leave the door
ajar, leaving the minimum required to hold your account open. This
would allow you to restore your investment in this fund should you
become more comfortable with the market in the future.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My grandchildren have shares of Lindner Growth Investors fund
in trust accounts. The results have been poor, with changes of
managers, etc. Should we wait for a hopeful improvement or sell? If
we sell, where should we put the proceeds?
</P>
<P>
   M.K., Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the last management change at Lindner Growth Investors
came late last year, and it s hard to see any improvement since.
Entering this week, year-to-date figures for the fund showed an 8.1
percent loss, which puts it in the bottom quartile of the small-cap
value fund arena. The average small-cap value fund had a 3.3
percent loss year-to-date, and even the top quartile wasn t getting
anywhere, showing an average return of precisely -- nothing. Do you
blame it on a tough market sector and wait a little longer of do
you head for the doors?
</P>
<P>
   Let s look at the longer record. Over three years the fund had
average annual gains of 8.1 percent, comparing unfavorably to a
peer average of 17.5 percent. Its last above- average performance,
according to Morningstar Mutual funds, came in 1994 (and it lost
money that year, albeit losing a bit less than its peers).
Mornignstar rates it below average overall -- above-average for
risk, low for performance. Yes -- that s enough; I d dump it.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative investment, if you want to stay in the
small-cap arena (and if your grandchildren are at least 10 years
away from college age) I d suggest Vanguard Small-Cap Index. If
they re older than that, I d look at a balanced fund such as
Vanguard Balanced Index. And if you want to stay within the Lindner
family, Lindner Dividend Investor seems to me to be its strongest
offering.

ACTS OF SELFISH FOLK CONTRIBUTE TO LONG, HOT SUMMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sitting in a line of interminable traffic recently, waiting for
the light to turn green, I witnessed what had to be one of the most
unbelievable sights imaginable during an unrelentingly hot Texas
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The ignoramus in the pickup ahead of me threw his still glowing
cigarette out the window and onto the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, North Texas was in the middle of a 29-day streak of
100-degree or more temperatures. It had been so long since the
ground had absorbed water that giant fissures had opened in the
earth. The color of the vegetation along the access road was a
parched golden brown _ not unlike the Colonel's extra-crispy
chicken.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking grass so dry that the heat from a car's engine can
be enough to spark a fire, and this moron flicks a lighted
cigarette out his window. It lands inches away from the tinder-dry
blades.
</P>
<P>
   Two things were on my mind as I threw the Beamer into park and
jumped from the car. First, make sure that cigarette is
extinguished. Second, give Bubba a butt-chewing he'll never forget.
But just as I crushed the cigarette into the pavement with the
bottom of my shoe, the line of traffic began to move forward and
Bubba drove off.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure he even saw me. My fellow travelers thanked me by
honking their horns. It was not, however, a sign of support,
judging by the looks on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba's blatant disregard for the overall public good just beats
out the water hogs for stupid acts perpetrated this summer by
selfish and thoughtless people.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone living in an area that has experienced on-again,
off-again water rationing made necessary by soaring temperatures
and busted pipelines has no doubt seen at least one water hog in
town. These are the swine who don't think policy applies to them,
that they are somehow exempt from not watering during a time when
city and utility officials are asking folks to cut down or
eliminate outdoor use of water.
</P>
<P>
   This act of selfishness is not confined to just the neighborhood
lawn freak who has planted a variety of grass not normally found
south of the Mason-Dixon Line and now must lay on 6 inches of water
everyday to keep it green. Businesses with automatic sprinkler
systems are prime offenders, particularly if the water rationing is
announced during a weekend and there's no one available to turn off
the timers at the company.
</P>
<P>
   I have a couple of suggestions for folks who have moved to Texas
from somewhere up in the Great North, which would be anywhere above
Oklahoma. Don't waste your time and money trying to re-create a
Michigan landscape in a Texas front yard. The result will be
anything but positive. Instead, plant grasses, bushes and trees
that are native to this area, and can handle the heat and lack of
moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Conserving water is everybody's business and what we are being
asked to do is not onerous or unreasonable. In fact, a few simple
changes in our everyday habits, suggested by the Texas Natural
Resource Conservation Commission, could make a tremendous
difference in our water reserves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only wash full loads of clothes and dishes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't leave the water running throughout the tooth-brushing
process. Wet your brush, turn the water off while you do the
scrubbing, then rinse.
</P>
<P>
   _ You'd be surprised how much water is wasted by leaky faucets
and toilets. True confession here. The Labbe household has a leaky
faucet in a bathtub. We haven't had a plumber out to fix it yet,
but the water isn't going to waste. We use a bucket to catch the
drops _ more than a gallon a day _ then use that water for the
household plants and a tiny little scrub pine my husband has been
nursing through the summer drought.
</P>
<P>
   If the water hogs have a hard time playing by the rules, wait
until the day arrives when they turn on the tap and nothing comes
out. Right now, officials are just asking us to limit outdoor water
use. Let's hope we don't get to the day when curtailing indoor
activities _ doing laundry, using automatic dishwaters, limiting
the number of showers or toilet flushes _ becomes necessary.
</P>
<P>
   And to the Bubba in the pickup with the potentially dangerous
littering habit, I'll be watching.

SPARRING IN THE LAND OF CREATIVE ANACHRONISMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLIPPERY ROCK, Pa. _ Once Kristina Schroeder .MDNM/arrives at
the Pennsic War, you can stop calling her by that name.
</P>
<P>
   For the next couple of weeks, she'll be going by the name
Andromache Magdelena de Venezia (``Andromache'' to her friends), a
Venician woman of the early Renaissance period.
</P>
<P>
   She's one of about 10,000 people who have gone back in time _
about 500 years or so. They're participating in a plague-free and
slightly user-friendly version of the Age of the Renaissance, less
than an hour from Pittsburgh and a world away from modernity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen anything like Pennsic,'' said Schroeder, of
Niskayuna, N.Y., who is here for the third time. ``It was almost
like walking into a fairyland.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have never worn a doublet and trunk hose or a chemise
under a heavy Tudor gown might wonder why so many people are
interested in the Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Blame the Society for Creative Anachronisms, which sponsors the
event. This worldwide organization that began in 1965 now has
20,000 dues-paying members.
</P>
<P>
   An anachronism, by the way, is a person or event out of time.
And at SCA there are a great many of them, and they can be pretty
creative.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, at events such as Pennsic (a play on
``Pennsylvania''), participants celebrate the best of the
Renaissance period: the clothes, the architecture, the plays and
music. Gone are the more morbid aspects of that era, such as rats
and lice, poverty and feudal slavery, open sewage and extreme
torture in the name of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to stay away from the bad parts,'' said JoAnne Williams
of Schenectady, N.Y., president of the Barony of Concordia of the
Snow chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Battles have also been cleaned up. No more inconvenient
disemboweling, no bloodstains to stain the expensive armor.
Instead, rattan swords are used and combatants are expected to fall
when a ``fatal'' blow has been struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sound of all that rattan hitting armor, it's really quite
amazing,'' Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   Not every anachronism is happy.
</P>
<P>
   Take the play Schroeder and her fellow thespians will perform.
It's called ``Euripides Trojan Women,''a Greek tragedy that takes
place after the fall of Troy, when the royal woman are killed or
sold into slavery. The play talks about how women are left to
suffer after their men are heroically killed in battle.
</P>
<P>
   As Troy's queen says after her only son is thrown to his death,
``Lost city, lost child, what climax of suffering lacks now? Have
we not reached in a headlong plunge the abyss of pain?''
</P>
<P>
   What would the Dark Ages be like without at least a little
angst?

<HEADLINE>
NEW KIMBELL MUSEUM DIRECTOR IS A BRILLIANT ACQUISITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When Kimbell Art Museum officials asked
Timothy Potts to be their new director, they were looking to take
care of museum business _ not to take the museum world by surprise.
They were looking for new leadership for the Kimbell, not a
revitalizing transfusion for American art museums in general.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Potts is a surprising choice _ if only because he comes
from Australia, rather than from the shrinking pool of U.S.
administrative talent, and is a relative unknown in America.
</P>
<P>
   He is not unknown, however, in Australia, where he's director of
Melbourne's National Gallery of Victoria _ Australia's oldest (137
years), largest (70,000 artworks) and best attended (1.2 million
visitors annually) art museum.
</P>
<P>
   Potts, 40, whose appointment was announced Thursday, is a great
fit for the Kimbell, with his youthful dynamism, his scholarly
depth and diverse range of professional experience. (How many
museum administrators have taught at Oxford AND worked as an
investment banker?)
</P>
<P>
   And he's also a fresh and unexpected addition to a U.S. museum
scene that is suffering an institutional identity crisis in the
midst of a purported Golden Age of American art museums.
</P>
<P>
   So, pardon me if I make this sound like the Second Coming. Potts
not only will hone the Kimbell's already distinguished identity,
but I think he also will help American museums (and their
directors) sort themselves out in general.
</P>
<P>
   He says he's attracted to America's ``can-do'' attitude although
these days, I'm not so sure that attitude extends to our museums.
We live in a time when art institutions are enjoying unprecedented
popularity, yet seem plagued by confusion over priorities. What
comes first: Attendance? Cultural diversity? Money? Education? Art?
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Kimbell enjoys relative freedom from these
concerns, Potts will refine its identity in ways that will inspire
many of his American colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at some of the remarkable things he accomplished
during his three-year tenure in Melbourne. He increased the
museum's earned income _ while eliminating admission fees to the
permanent collection. He doubled attendance. He boosted its
acquisitions endowment by 40 percent, increased corporate and
private support for the museum, and oversaw publication of catalogs
of the NGV's Old Master and 19th- and early 20th-century paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership, the NGV acquired major works from
antiquity, from Asia and in the area of European painting.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Potts oversaw renovation of the museum's building
and development of plans for a new NGV Museum of Australian Art.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has accomplished so much and is justifiably
admired in Australia, Potts was eager to come to the United States,
where he believes his diverse experiences can contribute even more
to the field.
</P>
<P>
   He also is eager to come to a museum renowned for its
collections, exhibitions and beautiful building.
</P>
<P>
   So what might we expect from Potts, once he has had a chance to
settle in sometime this fall?
</P>
<P>
   Look for him to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Develop a master plan for renovation and modest remodeling of
the Kimbell's Louis Kahn building _ one that encompasses developing
an adjacent property that the Kimbell Art Foundation recently
purchased.
</P>
<P>
   _ Continue making important acquisitions _ with an understanding
that there are fewer works of high quality available for purchase
with every passing season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Continue developing and presenting important exhibitions _
with, perhaps, less emphasis on blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Work with the Amon Carter Museum and Modern Art Museum of Fort
Worth on cooperative programs that enhance learning about works
from all three collections.
</P>
<P>
   _ Work with those museums and with Texas Christian University to
support TCU's new museum studies graduate program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nurture scholarly research by presenting and documenting
symposiums and other programs, and expanding museum publication
overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimbell has flourished under the stewardship of its wise
trustees and its two brilliant past directors. Ric Brown, as
Kimbell president Kay Fortson is wont to say, built the building
and took the Kimbell to the nation; Ted Pillsbury, who ended his
17-year tenure in June, built the collection and took the Kimbell
to the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimbell is poised to achieve new greatness under Timothy
Potts. And, as it does, let's not forget that art lovers and art
institutions around the nation and world will be watching.

Tower and fog. It has played eight times a week 51 weeks a year for
the last 24 years, and every show is a sellout in the 400-seat Club

Roland Anderson, a biologist at the Seattle Aquarium. In fact, they
are even smart enough to have fun. Last month, a researcher
documented that the animals actually engage in play behavior, a

each individual unique, are the genetic determinants of health and
disease. Now, because of machines that rapidly decode DNA, the
chemical chain that embodies the genetic instructions, snips are
becoming more accessible and more highly prized. Snips will help
population geneticists reconstruct the size and timing of the early
human migrations that peopled the globe. And they should enable
medical geneticists to trace elusive links between genes and

   SCI-RESTORING-SPEECH (Undated) _ Doctors have long been trying
to give people their voices back. In the 20th century, ear and
throat specialists have treated the voiceless with a variety of
what they call larynoplastic phono surgeries operations to make
vocal cords work again. For the future, some surgeons see a return
to electricity in the form of tiny pacemakers helping the vocal

`FELICITY' MAKES THE GRADE AS MOST-PROMISING NEW TV SHOW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE McDANIEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keri Russell is about to go major.
</P>
<P>
   As in major television star.
</P>
<P>
   As in all the major trappings that go with being major: major
magazine cover girl, major darling of the press, major gossip
topic, major movie presence.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be alarmed if you've never heard of her. Her previous
shows had little buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think you're behind if you haven't seen her show.
``Felicity'' doesn't debut until next month on the WB.
</P>
<P>
   Just be prepared to see and hear a lot about the pair of them
during the next weeks, months, year. Fashion mags, entertainment
rags and whispering wags all have their designs on her and her
show.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the attention is the impressive advance word on
``Felicity.'' In general, TV critics and media buyers who have seen
a few clips or an abbreviated pilot of the show have tapped
``Felicity'' as heir apparent to ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's ``Ally'' and the WB's ``Dawson's Creek'' were the two true
hits of the 1997-98 season, and the early word is that ``Felicity''
will be the standout series of the 37 new shows to launch during
the next 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in an attempt to further cement the ``Ally-Felicity''
connection, some critics have labeled Felicity ``Ally McBeal goes
to college.''
</P>
<P>
   That's clever, but lazy and inaccurate. ``Ally'' contains farce,
exaggeration, quirky characters, outlandish plot lines and
occasional hallucinations. It is a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' is a coming-of-age drama. It's about a high school
graduate facing big decisions and sometimes making foolish ones.
It's about a small-town California girl who suddenly finds herself
at a college in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   She's about to get the education of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, who never went to college, is getting her education on
the fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way overwhelming, the attention the show is receiving,''
says the 22-year-old, green-eyed, wavy-haired beauty. She sits at a
cafe table, enjoying a beverage ``al fresco'' on a bright and
breezy late afternoon in southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been amazingly receptive to the show. And, with
the exception of a few, people have been really nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this July day, she, her castmates and producers suffered
an hour in a room with some 200 members of the TV press. It was an
exercise in intimidation for Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Russell has decided that the meeting with the press was ``awful,
the most horrifying experience. You're thinking, `Oh my God, all
these people are going to judge the show off these one or two
sentences I say. And I'll probably use the worst grammar.' And it's
like, Oh! It's horrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   But her reaction is too introspective. The press, lethargic
after many dealings with mediocre shows, exhibited a genuine
interest in Russell and ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell may feel like an amateur in dealing with the media, but
she is far from a freshman when it comes to acting.
</P>
<P>
   From 1989 to 1992 she was a member of Disney Channel's ``Mickey
Mouse Club.'' She's had runs in four other series, all short-lived:
``Emerald Cove'' (1993), ``Daddy's Girls'' (1994), ``Malibu
Shores'' (1996) and last summer's experiment on Fox, ``Roar.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 she played Mandy in the film ``Honey, I Blew Up the
Kid.'' She's also had roles in a couple of TV movies, most notably
as Erica in last year's ``When Innocence Is Lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Her name is spelled K-e-r-i, ``which is almost the Irish way,''
she says. ``But my grandfather's name was Kermit, and that's who
I'm named after.''
</P>
<P>
   Mom and Dad live in the Dallas area. Russell has been living on
her own since age 17. She and her cat, Nala, live in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps her acting experience, plus living on her own for the
past five years, have prepared her for the meaty role of Felicity
Porter. Whatever it is, she transmits the confusion and the
complexity of a female college freshman with just the right amount
of naivete. We buy into her, completely.
</P>
<P>
   It helps to know a little of Felicity's past to understand her
present. She's smart as in book smart, and she's not so naive that
she doesn't know about boys and sex. She's simply inexperienced.
</P>
<P>
   So on high school graduation day, she feels educated but
detached. She's followed the path carefully laid out by her
parents, and she feels good about that. But she also feels choked,
``surrounded by people actually looking forward to their lives,''
she tells us in voice-over.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't feel joy, sorrow or anticipation. Just dread.
</P>
<P>
   She has had an eye on classmate Ben Covington (Scott Speedman)
for four years, but they've remained emotional strangers. But
today, on impulse, she asks him to sign her yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's the smallest decisions that can pretty much
change your life forever,'' we hear her say to herself, to us.
</P>
<P>
   Ben takes his time, and his words compress her heart. ``Today, I
don't know you but I admire you.''
</P>
<P>
   Zing!
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly I knew what everyone else was feeling,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She confronts her parents. She cannot follow in her father's
footsteps and take the premed track at Stanford University.
Instead, she will follow her heart. Ben is going to college in New
York. She will follow, even if it means seeking student loans, even
though she doesn't know Ben Covington at all.
</P>
<P>
   And we're off to the races, already intrigued as to what might
happen next, then next. To the credit of its creators, filmmakers
J.J. Abrams (``Armageddon,'' ``Regarding Henry'') and Matt Reeves
(``The Pallbearer''), we're still intrigued at hour's end.
</P>
<P>
   And the most attractive part of the show comes from Russell. It
is innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous that she makes this choice for this boy she
doesn't even talk to,'' says Russell. ``But when she does, it
instigates this whole new outlook in her being, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams says, ``If the show were about a young girl following a
boy, it's a show I would never want to watch. I think one of the
reasons that people seem to enjoy the show is because it isn't
about that. There's a much bigger reason she ends up staying (at
college). What she learns is that getting away and taking charge of
your life is something incredibly important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the drama of the show,'' says Reeves, ``that she will
be making different mistakes because she's still becoming a formed
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves and Abrams have been film collaborators almost as long as
they've been friends, which is 20 years. They are both 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night, having dinner, I told Matt this idea that I had
about this young girl who makes this crazy mistake,'' says Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   Every time they tried to make a movie out of it, it didn't work.
``It felt like a phony,'' Abrams says.
</P>
<P>
   So Abrams instead wrote a TV script that Reeves would direct.
Together they approached Imagine Entertainment, Ron Howard's
company. Imagine's contribution shows up in the quality of the
finished product.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams and Reeves took ``Felicity'' to ABC, and when that
network couldn't guarantee them a time slot, they took the show to
the WB. The suits there leaped at it. They're giving Russell a
primo time: 8 p.m., CDT, Wednesdays following ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keri is astonishing,'' Reeves says. ``This is simply a
situation where she's been given the opportunity to express what's
inside of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once said to her, `Wow, when we got into the scenes you
really connected with everything you were doing.' And she said,
`Well, you know, Felicity really says all the things that I'm
thinking but just afraid to say.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I mean, I think it's really about the opportunity for her
to express herself, and what you're seeing is Keri.''
</P>
<P>
   The compliment rushes over her, and she returns it at her
expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now I haven't really liked anything I've done,'' says
Russell. ``This is the first time I've been really interested in a
project.''
</P>
<P>
   And she is its star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's really overwhelming. I mean, it's really daunting,
you know, to think that if it doesn't do well, it's all my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   She laughs a little laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no, it is an ensemble show. And in the next few episodes,
you'll really see that. (Her roommate is introduced, among other
happenings.) But yeah, it's overwhelming. I have little panic
attacks every once in a while. But it's a really good feeling to do
something you're enjoying and that you're proud of.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese Nobel Peace laureate, may be the
most spied-on, or surveilled, human being on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The SLORC _ State Law and Order Restoration Council _ which took
over Burma in 1988 and changed its name to Myanmar, sees Suu Kyi as
a primary threat. She heads the country's popular opposition
movement and, given her personal charisma and extraordinary family
history, she has a strong claim on the allegiance of the Burmese
people.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's father, Aung San, led a successful battle against
British colonial rule in 1947. He was assassinated that same year
at age 32, when Suu Kyi was only 2. Aung San remains a legend and a
national hero in Burma. There are statues of him, streets named for
him and museums of his life.
</P>
<P>
   His image is featured on Burmese currency, the one-kyat bill,
which the SLORC yanked from circulation. His portrait on this bill
greatly resembles his daughter. Pro-democracy protesters have
adopted the note, which is worth less than a penny, as their flag
of freedom. It has come to be known as the ``democracy note.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not, as my father's daughter, remain indifferent to
all that was going on,'' Suu Kyi told an audience of 500,000 at the
beginning of her ``revolution-of-the-spirit'' campaign for
democracy in 1988. This was soon after a bloody takeover by the
SLORC in which thousands of demonstrators were massacred in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990 elections, her party, the National League for
Democracy (NLD), won a landslide victory _ even though was under
house arrest. The triumph was considered a vindication for Suu Kyi,
whose was placed under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In her most famous essay, ``Freedom From Fear,'' released in
1991, Aung San Suu Kyi explains the necessity for individual
transformation to bring about real change, and writes: ``Among the
basic freedoms to which men aspire that their lives might be full
and uncramped, freedom from fear stands out as both a means and an
end.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, after being released, Suu Kyi was able to give
speeches at her front gate every Saturday and Sunday, answering
questions the people submitted to her.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by roving military-intelligence video cameras and the
imminent risk of arrest, thousands of Burmese would sit on old
newspapers and plastic bags on the sidewalk to cheer, laugh and
listen to the lady.
</P>
<P>
   But the junta then banned these gatherings and since mid-1995
has kept Suu Kyi under de-facto house arrest. The authorities have
arrested hundreds of her party members and prevented Suu Kyi from
meeting with journalists and diplomats. If they leave her house,
her bodyguards and assistants face being hauled off to one of
Burma's horrific prisons.
</P>
<P>
   When awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 _ while again under
house arrest _ Suu Kyi was cited by the Nobel Committee as ``one of
the most extraordinary examples of civil courage in Asia in recent
decades.''
</P>
<P>
   The SLORC _ buoyed by billions from Burma's booming drug trade
and foreign investment _ shows no intention of turning over power
peacefully. Further repression and major bloodshed loom on the
horizon. Still, Aung San Suu Kyi and her followers remain
steadfastly committed to the path of nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   This interview was conducted by telephone in January 1997,
shortly after a violent incident in which Suu Kyi was in her
automobile, en route to visit pro-democracy supporters. A mob of
thugs _ some throwing stones, some wielding iron bars _ surrounded
the vehicle and smashed the windshield. It was, the world press
noted, in an area controlled by government forces, who did nothing
to intervene.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: The attack on you and your colleagues in your car was a
serious threat to your security. What were your thoughts in that
moment when your car was being attacked?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: It was quite interesting. (She laughs.) I was fairly
detached. I saw it all as an observer. There were all these faces
crowding in toward the car, and there was one man in front with an
iron bar in his hand, who I assume was the one who made the big
gash in my windscreen.
</P>
<P>
   I just said, ``Keep moving'' _ I made the decision that we were
simply going to continue on to meet the crowds that had come to
support us. One of the boys who was in the car with us was a bit
angry about the whole thing, so I spent some time calming him down
and telling him not to be angry.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear to us that the attack was a deliberate attempt
to harm us badly or even kill us. It is, of course, very serious.
But we do not consider our own personal safety as any more serious
than the safety and security of the people in general.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the United States, some cities and the state of
Massachusetts have chosen not to do business with companies that
deal with Burma. Is this an effective means of supporting
democratization in Burma?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Very much so. We would like to see more of this. It's
consumer power. It's good to know that the people of different
countries are really concerned and involved in the movement to help
Burma. I think in some ways it's better to have the people of the
world on your side than the governments of the world, even if
governments can be more effective in certain directions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In November '96 the SLORC launched a tourism campaign called
``Visit Myanmar Year.'' Are you still calling for tourists to
boycott Burma?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Yes, my mind has not changed in any way. I still oppose
``Visit Myanmar Year'' and I'd ask tourists to stay away. Burma is
not going to run away. They should come back to Burma at a time
when it is a democratic society _ where there is justice, where
there is rule of law. They'll have a much better time. And they can
travel around Burma with a clear conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Burma today there is an increasing availability and use of
heroin on college campuses. Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: The government appears to be more interested in
stamping out political activity than drug addiction. Very few
university students on the campus could get away with engaging in
political activities, but they seem to be able to get away with
taking drugs. We have heard that it is very easy to obtain drugs on
the campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do you think the heroin used by students is sometimes
nicknamed ``freedom from fear'' _ the same name as your famous
essay?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Perhaps it means that the only way the students can
escape from the fear of the repression of the government is by
taking drugs. That would be very sad, wouldn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Burma provides 60 percent of the heroin imported to the
United States, and many of the ethnic peoples are financially
dependent on the opium crop. Do you think crop substitution in the
areas where poppies are grown would be an effective way to fight
addiction?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Yes, it's one way. But basically I think that in order
to do something like that, you have to win the confidence of the
people, and I don't think you can win people's confidence through
intimidation and repression. First we would like to talk to the
people concerned and discuss the problem with them. That is what
democracy is all about. You talk over your problems with the people
because the people are involved in the whole process of government.
</P>
<P>
   As for the National League for Democracy, we are of course
against the proliferation of drugs because we recognize that they
are harmful, not just for our own people but for people all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly a democratic government would do its best to make sure
that the growing of opium is eliminated in this country and that
the people who depend on growing opium for their life will find
other ways of earning a living.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There is a burgeoning AIDS epidemic in Burma. Reports
describe shooting galleries that service 200 addicts with one
needle. Have you heard about this problem, and do you have plans
for dealing with the underlying causes of AIDS?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: We do hear that AIDS is on the increase, and that's
partly due to the fact that the authorities never really attack
problems at their source. They seem to think that if they insist
the problem does not exist, it will simply go away. The best way to
deal with AIDS is through education. So we need a really widespread
AIDS education program.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what we need in Burma is education of all kinds _
political, economic and medical. AIDS education would be just one
part of a whole program for education, which is so badly needed in
our country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you tell people when they get discouraged?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: We are confident that our cause will prevail because
that is what the great majority of the people in Burma want. We all
want justice and human rights. Since what we want will benefit all
the people in Burma, our cause is bound to win.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much personal danger do you feel? Have you been
threatened that if you leave your compound or try and speak to the
people, you will be in trouble or you might be imprisoned?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: I haven't been told anything like that, but of course
the official papers are always talking about ``annihilating'' our
forces. (She laughs again.)
</P>
<P>
   But we don't think about that too much. There's no time to be
thinking about such things.

<P>
   Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese Nobel Peace laureate, may be the
most spied-on, or surveilled, human being on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The SLORC _ State Law and Order Restoration Council _ which took
over Burma in 1988 and changed its name to Myanmar, sees Suu Kyi as
a primary threat. She heads the country's popular opposition
movement and, given her personal charisma and extraordinary family
history, she has a strong claim on the allegiance of the Burmese
people.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's father, Aung San, led a successful battle against
British colonial rule in 1947. He was assassinated that same year
at age 32, when Suu Kyi was only 2. Aung San remains a legend and a
national hero in Burma. There are statues of him, streets named for
him and museums of his life.
</P>
<P>
   His image is featured on Burmese currency, the one-kyat bill,
which the SLORC yanked from circulation. His portrait on this bill
greatly resembles his daughter. Pro-democracy protesters have
adopted the note, which is worth less than a penny, as their flag
of freedom. It has come to be known as the ``democracy note.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not, as my father's daughter, remain indifferent to
all that was going on,'' Suu Kyi told an audience of 500,000 at the
beginning of her ``revolution-of-the-spirit'' campaign for
democracy in 1988. This was soon after a bloody takeover by the
SLORC in which thousands of demonstrators were massacred in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990 elections, her party, the National League for
Democracy (NLD), won a landslide victory _ even though was under
house arrest. The triumph was considered a vindication for Suu Kyi,
whose was placed under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In her most famous essay, ``Freedom From Fear,'' released in
1991, Aung San Suu Kyi explains the necessity for individual
transformation to bring about real change, and writes: ``Among the
basic freedoms to which men aspire that their lives might be full
and uncramped, freedom from fear stands out as both a means and an
end.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, after being released, Suu Kyi was able to give
speeches at her front gate every Saturday and Sunday, answering
questions the people submitted to her.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by roving military-intelligence video cameras and the
imminent risk of arrest, thousands of Burmese would sit on old
newspapers and plastic bags on the sidewalk to cheer, laugh and
listen to the lady.
</P>
<P>
   But the junta then banned these gatherings and since mid-1995
has kept Suu Kyi under de-facto house arrest. The authorities have
arrested hundreds of her party members and prevented Suu Kyi from
meeting with journalists and diplomats. If they leave her house,
her bodyguards and assistants face being hauled off to one of
Burma's horrific prisons.
</P>
<P>
   When awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 _ while again under
house arrest _ Suu Kyi was cited by the Nobel Committee as ``one of
the most extraordinary examples of civil courage in Asia in recent
decades.''
</P>
<P>
   The SLORC _ buoyed by billions from Burma's booming drug trade
and foreign investment _ shows no intention of turning over power
peacefully. Further repression and major bloodshed loom on the
horizon. Still, Aung San Suu Kyi and her followers remain
steadfastly committed to the path of nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   This interview was conducted by telephone in January 1997,
shortly after a violent incident in which Suu Kyi was in her
automobile, en route to visit pro-democracy supporters. A mob of
thugs _ some throwing stones, some wielding iron bars _ surrounded
the vehicle and smashed the windshield. It was, the world press
noted, in an area controlled by government forces, who did nothing
to intervene.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: The attack on you and your colleagues in your car was a
serious threat to your security. What were your thoughts in that
moment when your car was being attacked?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: It was quite interesting. (She laughs.) I was fairly
detached. I saw it all as an observer. There were all these faces
crowding in toward the car, and there was one man in front with an
iron bar in his hand, who I assume was the one who made the big
gash in my windscreen.
</P>
<P>
   I just said, ``Keep moving'' _ I made the decision that we were
simply going to continue on to meet the crowds that had come to
support us. One of the boys who was in the car with us was a bit
angry about the whole thing, so I spent some time calming him down
and telling him not to be angry.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear to us that the attack was a deliberate attempt
to harm us badly or even kill us. It is, of course, very serious.
But we do not consider our own personal safety as any more serious
than the safety and security of the people in general.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the United States, some cities and the state of
Massachusetts have chosen not to do business with companies that
deal with Burma. Is this an effective means of supporting
democratization in Burma?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Very much so. We would like to see more of this. It's
consumer power. It's good to know that the people of different
countries are really concerned and involved in the movement to help
Burma. I think in some ways it's better to have the people of the
world on your side than the governments of the world, even if
governments can be more effective in certain directions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In November '96 the SLORC launched a tourism campaign called
``Visit Myanmar Year.'' Are you still calling for tourists to
boycott Burma?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Yes, my mind has not changed in any way. I still oppose
``Visit Myanmar Year'' and I'd ask tourists to stay away. Burma is
not going to run away. They should come back to Burma at a time
when it is a democratic society _ where there is justice, where
there is rule of law. They'll have a much better time. And they can
travel around Burma with a clear conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Burma today there is an increasing availability and use of
heroin on college campuses. Why is that?

flak the beauty and sophistication of the octopus. Some will talk
about how clever the octopus is: ``The most intelligent
invertebrate in the world, there's no denying it,'' according to
Roland Anderson, a biologist at the Seattle Aquarium. In fact, they

becoming more accessible and more highly prized. Snips will help
population geneticists reconstruct the size and timing of the early

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By THOMAS CHRISTIAN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ The roar came from a camouflaged area
beyond a thicket of woods: ``Nevermore!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forevermore!''
</P>
<P>
   Young James Barhyte stared into the bleak forest from whence the
sound came. ``Nevermore!?'' the 12-year-old mimicked incredulously,
``What a name for a bird! Whoever heard of a bird named
`Nevermore'?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have it,'' muttered the poet Edgar Allan Poe as he emerged
from the woods, a black slouch hat shading his eyes. ``Just the
thing that will make the very stanza I need to complete the poem.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was that the legendary prose of ``The Raven'' had roots in
Saratoga Springs on the grounds of what would become the writers'
colony called Yaddo. At least that is the account of Schenectady
minister William Griffis, who wrote about the exchange in a 1924
edition of The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   In the same densely wooded Saratoga landscape where Poe roamed
150 years ago, the secluded 400-acre Yaddo estate sits in between
the race track and Exit 14 of the Northway. Upon the estate is a
sprawling terrain of blue stucco barns and tranquil ponds,
blossoming gardens, a pair of spooky graveyards and a grand 55-room
Victorian mansion that looms creepily atop a hill.
</P>
<P>
   Since its incorporation in 1900, Yaddo has been a creative
catalyst to many of the 20th century's most talented writers and
poets, and to a lesser extent, musicians and artists.
</P>
<P>
   It's where, among the subtle clang of the wind-triggered chimes,
William Carlos Williams completed Book IV of his inspirational poem
``Paterson''; James T. Farrell created ``Studs Lonigan''; Saul
Bellow wrote ``Henderson The Rain King''; James Baldwin produced
``Giovanni's Room''; and a young Delmore Schwartz poured over
translations of Rimbaud's ``Une Saison en Enfer.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, contemporary artists such as David Sedaris and Maggie
Estep continue to tread the same manicured lawn avenues as Sylvia
Plath, Truman Capote and Dorothy Parker had generations ago.
</P>
<P>
   American Revolutionary soldier Jacobus Barhyte purchased the
land where Yaddo would be built in 1784, operating a tavern that
became a favorite stopover among distinguished Spa visitors of the
early 19th century. Along with Poe, James Fennimore Cooper,
Washington Irving and future president Andrew Jackson were known to
visit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1874, 21-year-old Brooklyn poet Kate Nicholls and New York
financier Spencer Trask were wed. Turning their Saratoga summers
into a permanent residence, they purchased the old Barhyte Estate
in 1881, renovated the existing Italian Villa into a Queen Anne,
then proceeded to erect a 55-room Tudor-style Victorian mansion
atop the original house's cindered ashes when it burned to the
ground a decade later. Fitting its interior with customized marble
sculptures, oil paintings, and hand-carved wooden decor, its
centerpiece is a Tiffany glass mosaic Phoenix rising over a
fireplace that reads: ``Unconquered by flames, Yaddo is reborn for
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 4-year-old Christina Trask, the couple's eldest of four
children _ all of whom died before reaching their teen-age years _
who gave the sweeping estate its name. ``Call it Yaddo, mama, for
it makes poetry, Yaddo shadow, shadow Yaddo.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1899, the Yaddo Gardens were built. It remains the one area
of the estate open to the public. The gardens are a multitiered
charm nestled at the foothills of the mansion. Comprised of four
oblong beds of white, pink, and red Radiance roses, a pyramidal
structure of dolomite rock sprouts one of nature's springs nearby.
Statues of Italian marble rest upon a myrtle base, and a lengthy
pergola designed of 38 symmetrically aligned Greek columns are
adorned with the brilliance of budding roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Katrina's Sundial'' of brass sits on a pedestal, inscribed
with the verse of poet Henry Van Dyke, its poetry selected by Lady
Jane Fellowes for recital at the funeral last year of her sister,
Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   The Trasks bequeathed Yaddo to the artists of the future and in
accordance with their mutual agreement, the project began in
earnest after they had both passed away. The first group of
official Yaddo guests arrived in the summer of 1926, the poet
Louise Bogan among them.
</P>
<P>
   A varied and talented group of artists has since followed.
Langston Hughes and Erica Jong. Paul Bowles and Henri
Cartier-Bresson. From the notorious word-slingers Lionel Trilling,
William Gass and David Foster Wallace, to contemporary culturalists
Alice Walker and Amy Tan. Postwar poets John Ashberry, Robert
Lowell, and Theodore Roethke have each enjoyed residencies here,
the latter two of which saw their efforts realized in the
respective publications of ``The Mills of The Kavanaughs'' and ``A
Field of Light.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich Village painter Robert DeNiro Sr. had a residency
there, delivered to the door by his son, Robert, acting as his
father's chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   The guests, who number as many as 35 at any one time, congregate
for morning and evening meals inside the main mansion. The hours in
between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. are reserved for the quiet isolation of
work; a black Thermos and lunchbox emblazoned with their name and
stocked with fruit, sandwiches, carrot sticks and a cookie their
sole companion.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of uninterrupted work, the guests congregate for
evening conversation, or may gather for recreational games of
pingpong or croquet.
</P>
<P>
   Some head for town to enjoy Saratoga, and to add to the
legendary cannon of tales, half-truths, and wild rumors that have
circulated through the ages befitting a group of creative stylists
sequestered in the woods.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Saratoga was an absolute wide open city, anything went,''
Malcolm Cowley told Robert McNeil in a 1986 PBS documentary on
Yaddo, recalling his residency in the early 1930s when he scripted
the ``Paris'' chapters of his Lost Generation memoir ``Exile's
Return.'' Edward Hotaling recounted the general mayhem in his
Saratoga racing book ``They're Off!'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes these giggling geniuses would jump in a station
wagon to go rollicking down to the movies at The Community Theatre
on Broadway, where the lady at the candy counter would take one
look and wonder what the hell they would think up next.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, like 1956 Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Elizabeth Bishop,
sought more wholesome avenues of escape, disappearing for morning
strolls through Yaddo's woods to the adjacent practice track with
blueberry muffin in hand, and finding a seat among the benches
watching the trainers exercising their horses.
</P>
<P>
   Yaddo's philosophy of offering respite to literary veteran and
relative newcomer alike has been a prosperous mix. Terry McMillan
wrote the first draft of her debut novel, ``Mama,'' while residing
at Yaddo, and Jules Feiffer scripted his first screenplay there.
Mario Puzo visited Yaddo in parts of 1958 and 1960, coming away
with the strands of his early novel, ``The Fortunate Pilgrim.''
Puzo would later reapply for residency in 1967 with the expressed
purpose of ``writing a story about a Mafia family'' that would
become ``The Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaddo's most famous young author arrived in May 1946. By the
time his residency concluded 11 weeks later, 21-year-old Truman
Capote had attained national recognition in a Life magazine photo
spread of his visit, and had created the prose that would become
``Other Voices, Other Rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Highsmith wrote her debut thriller ``Strangers On A
Train,'' during a residency in 1948. The work was later adapted for
a film of the same name by Alfred Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting musicians and composers orchestrate their own circle of
notoriety, among them Leonard Bernstein, Marc Blitzstein, Oscar
Levant, Ned Rorem and Aaron Copland.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Yaddo alumni have been awarded 48 Pulitzer Prizes and
45 National Book Awards.

REPORT ACCUSES CIA OF INTERFERING IN CRIMINAL CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On a hot August day in 1984, a lawyer from CIA
headquarters walked into the office of a federal prosecutor in San
Francisco to ask for a favor.
</P>
<P>
   The man from the Central Intelligence Agency was reluctant to
give his name or his government affiliation, the assistant U.S.
attorney recalled, and embarked on an ``opaque conversation'' about
what he called an ``uncomfortable situation'': Drug agents had
seized $36,020 from a defendant in the West Coast's biggest cocaine
bust. The defendant claimed the cash was not drug profits but money
belonging to U.S.-backed contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's
Sandinista government.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant's lawyers were set to go to Costa Rica to question
two contra leaders about the money. The CIA feared this might cause
unwanted publicity and ``potential ... disaster'' for the agency's
contra operations, the CIA lawyer, Lee Strickland, said in a
subsequent cable.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan administration's contra program already was under
fire in Congress, which had threatened to cut CIA funding for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the allegations might be entirely false, there are
sufficient factual details which could cause certain damage to our
image and program in Central America,'' Strickland's cable read.
</P>
<P>
   At the prosecutor's office, Strickland stressed that the agency
would be ``immensely grateful'' if the money were returned to the
drug dealer, eliminating any reason for the defense lawyer's
potentially troublesome questions in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. attorney's office aggressively confiscates
suspected drug funds, it decided within a week to return the money.
``The United States attorney was most deferential to our
interests,'' Strickland said in another cable.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's discreet visit was described in a report last month
from the Justice Department's office of inspector general, which
examined allegations that department officials protected drug
dealers because of ties to the contras or pressure from the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The 407-page report by Inspector General Michael R. Bromwich
provides new evidence about the refund, saying it resulted partly
from the CIA's ``desire to protect the public image of the contras
or the CIA'' and thus raised a question of ``propriety.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report was prompted by 1996 articles in
the San Jose Mercury News suggesting that CIA complicity in contra
drug trafficking largely was responsible for the crack cocaine
epidemic. The report found the newspaper's main allegations were
not substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report confirms that the Justice
Department and the CIA withheld information about the San Francisco
case from a Senate inquiry in the late 1980s, a former Senate
investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA cables cited in the report also conflict with statements
by then-U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello, who has maintained that
the money was returned solely to avoid a costly legal fight.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report affords a rare _ if not entirely
clear _ view of secret CIA operations. And it poses a troubling
question that may arise when intelligence agencies intercede in
prosecutions: Are they protecting national-security interests, or
avoiding public accountability?
</P>
<P>
   Although a few significant California drug dealers appeared to
provide modest sums to the contras, the report said, none got
special treatment because of political activities. Allegations that
their trafficking was linked to the CIA were ``not supported by the
facts,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   And neither the CIA nor any other national security arm reached
out to prosecutors on behalf of the dealers _ except in the San
Francisco case, an instance the study called troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the reason for the refund remains murky, the report
expressed concern that the CIA ``considered the potential press
coverage of a contra-drug link to be sufficient reason to attempt
to influence the decision to return the money.''
</P>
<P>
   CIA spokeswoman Anya Guilsher declined to discuss the propriety
of the agency's action. The CIA intervened not to help the
defendant, she said, but because the CIA mistakenly believed one of
the contra leaders to be questioned in Costa Rica had worked with
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA stepped in after federal agents seized 430 pounds of
cocaine as divers unloaded it from a Colombian freighter on Jan.
17, 1983, at Pier 96 in San Francisco, in what became known as the
``Frogman case.''
</P>
<P>
   Among some 50 people ultimately convicted was a Nicaraguan named
Julio Zavala. When drug agents raided his South San Francisco home,
they confiscated cocaine, two weapons and $36,020.
</P>
<P>
   Judd Iversen, Zavala's lawyer, filed a motion seeking court
permission to take depositions in Costa Rica that, he said, would
prove the money belonged to a contra group and that U.S. agents
sanctioned, or were involved in, selling cocaine to fund the
contras.
</P>
<P>
   The late U.S. District Judge Robert F. Peckham ruled there was
no basis for allowing depositions about a CIA role in drug
smuggling. But he said Iversen could question two contra leaders in
Costa Rica about the source of the money.
</P>
<P>
   But by Aug. 14, 1984, prosecutors had opted to return the money
to Zavala and the depositions were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The government never conceded it was contra money. And Zavala,
an alleged leader of the drug ring, was convicted in 1985 on six
felony charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 1986 San Francisco Examiner report on the refund sparked
inquiries by Congress and the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Russoniello sent a letter to the newspaper's editor expressing
outrage at the suggestion that his office returned the money for
political reasons or tried to cover up a link between contras and
drug traffickers. Zavala was prosecuted fully, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also said the refund ``had nothing to do with any
claim that the funds came from the contras or belonged to the
contras. It had to do with the fact that it would have cost the
taxpayers ... at least that much to fund the excursion to Costa
Rica.''
</P>
<P>
   But CIA cables and officials give a different account: In late
July 1984, the CIA's Costa Rica station sent a cable to CIA
headquarters in Langley, Va., reporting _ in what the agency later
called a case of mistaken identity _ that one of the contra leaders
to be deposed was a former CIA employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Station is concerned that this kind of uncoordinated
activity'' _ the depositions _ ``could have serious implications
for anti-Sandinista activities in Costa Rica and elsewhere,'' the
cable said.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   As a result, on Aug. 7, 1984, Strickland visited the prosecutor
on the case, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Zanides, about the
``uncomfortable situation,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   A cable on Aug. 24, 1984, explained that the agency made this
``discreet approach'' to ``ascertain details of the subject
prosecution and to avoid inquiry into activities or other (CIA)
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable said ``it was agreed by all that any litigation
concerning the currency seizure would be fruitless. In essence, the
United States Attorney could never disprove the defendant's
allegation that (this) was (CIA) money ... Accordingly, at (the
CIA's) request, the U.S. Attorney has agreed to return the money to
Zavala ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only guess as to what other testimony may have been
forthcoming. ... (the CIA) will continue to monitor the prosecution
closely so that any further disclosures or allegations by defendant
or his confidants can be deflected. ... the United States Attorney
was most deferential to our interests ... ''
</P>
<P>
   A CIA official _ identified in the report only by the alias of
Ms. Jones _ told the inspector general's office that the burning
issue in the Frogman case was the potential claim that a CIA asset
was diverting agency funds to the drug trade and the risk of bad
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   When the inspector inquired if it was unusual for the CIA to ask
prosecutors for a favor, Jones said all intelligence agencies
routinely encounter problems in protecting their operatives. She
said her office _ the CIA's policy coordination staff _ focused on
protecting CIA interests implicated in court cases.
</P>
<P>
   Zanides said he reported his contact with the CIA to
Russoniello, who later ordered him to cancel the depositions
because of their cost, the report said. Zanides said he wasn't
concerned about refunding the money because it didn't jeopardize
the prosecution, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report concluded, ``Zanides likely
passed on this information, as it is unlikely that a line assistant
would not notify his superiors of contact by an attorney from the
CIA.''
</P>
<P>
   CIA documents conflict with the Justice Department's denial in
the late 1980s that any intelligence agency had interceded in cases
involving allegations of contras and drugs, said Jack Blum, who
investigated the cases as special counsel to the Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee on terrorism, narcotics and international
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Will Mancino declined to comment on
the earlier denials.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA withheld documents on the Frogman case from the
subcommittee. The agency's efforts to have the cash returned ``did
not appear to be intended to influence the outcome of Zavala's
trial,'' a recent CIA report said, but to protect its contra
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA cables, it added, exaggerated the agency's influence on
the decision to refund the money.
</P>
<P>
   Guilsher said the agency does not often intercede in criminal
cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the Frogman case, the inspector general concluded that Zavala
or his friends ``fabricated the claim that the seized money
belonged to the contras ... to salvage some of his drug profits.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bromwich, the inspector general, called on the public,
Congress and the CIA's inspector general to ``assess the propriety
of (the CIA's) intervening in this law-enforcement matter based, at
least partly, on a desire to protect the public image of the
Contras or the CIA.''

FEW PC USERS FLEXING MACHINES' NEW MUSCLES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Subhed: Low-end computers today are much more powerful than a few
years ago, but demands made by operating systems, software are
still pretty tame) 
 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ George Bush stormed the desert of Kuwait with hundreds
of thousands of soldiers, high-tech missiles and the latest stealth
aircraft. But today, the former president's office in Houston makes
do with lowly Pentium 133 personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   And they're refurbished ones, at that.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to the consultants who set up and maintain the
computer network at Bush's office, they work quite nicely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, that's a significant upgrade for them, considering
what they had just earlier this year,'' said Terry Tisdale, a
senior technical staff member at Insource Technologies. ``They were
running on 486-33s.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's office workers use basic business applications _ word
processing, spreadsheets, e-mail, World Wide Web browsers _ and the
older computers handle these jobs just fine.
</P>
<P>
   They, and many other businesses and individuals, are taking
advantage of a cycle in PC technology in which low-cost hardware is
more than adequate for most computing tasks. Low-cost systems are
no longer technological weaklings.
</P>
<P>
   People can buy powerful computers today for well under $1,000
that, a year ago, cost in the $2,500 to $3,000 price range.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes the people at Intel cringe,'' said Nathan
Brookwood, an analyst at Dataquest, a market research firm that
studies technology trends. ``Even though hardware has gotten more
and more powerful, people are basically doing the same things with
it and using the same kind of software tools as they did three
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The current state of hardware/software balance is the opposite
of where it was three years ago, when new operating systems from
Microsoft bogged down the most commonly used processor technology
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that machine you purchased in 1992, with an 80486
chip running at 33 megahertz or 66 megahertz?'' asked Brookwood.
``And remember how nicely Windows 3.1 ran on it? Then you put
Windows 95 on it and you said, `Oh my God, what happened to slow
this machine down?'''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Beilinson, a product manager at Microsoft who works on the
Windows NT operating system, said that while the microprocessor is
one of the most crucial factors in PC performance, there are
others. They include the amount of system memory; the speed of the
hard drive; the graphics card; and, for machines connected to a
network or the Internet, the speed of that connection.
</P>
<P>
   Some applications tax computers more than others, as does the
way people use them. Simple programs, such as word processors and
e-mail, don't make many demands on a PC. Graphics programs and
cutting-edge, 3-D games put more stress on a computer's hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Users who run many different programs at once _ such as a word
processor, a spreadsheet, e-mail, a Web browser, a presentation
graphics program and personal information manager _ also put heavy
demands on a PC.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of load is unusual, though. Microsoft estimates that
the average user has only three programs running simultaneously on
Windows 95/98 PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say computers selling at the low end of the market
today can handle these situations with ease. As a result, most
buyers don't need to drop big bucks on higher-powered _ and
higher-priced _ systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many people who really need a Pentium II,''
Brookwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Most sub-$1,000 systems sold today use either an Intel Pentium
MMX chip, or one from a competing chip maker that is compatible
with the Pentium design. The processors run at speeds of 200 to 233
megahertz, and the systems have 32 megabytes of memory _ more than
enough to run several moderate-sized programs comfortably. That
configuration is similar to Apple Computer's new iMac system, aimed
at consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Such systems sold for much more about this time last year.
Houston's Compaq Computer Corp., for example, was selling
233-megahertz &UR;  &LR; Presario systems for between $1,700 and $2,700 last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Compaq offers a 266-megahertz Presario that uses an
Advanced Micro Devices K6 chip _ a clone of the Pentium MMX
processor _ for $899.
</P>
<P>
   And $2,600 today will get you a 400-megahertz Pentium II system
with 128 megabytes of memory, a 10-gigabyte hard drive and
impressive 3-D graphics. Analysts say that a year from now these
systems will cost less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Processors have increased dramatically in power since the days
of the early 80486, Intel's primary chip available at the time
Windows 95 was introduced. A 66-megahertz 80486 chip would handle
54 million instructions per second. By comparison, a 133-megahertz
Pentium chip _ the kind used in former President Bush's office _
can do nearly 219 million instructions per second. And a Pentium
Pro chip running at 200 megahertz _ used primarily in file server
computers as part of corporate networks _ can handle up to 300
million instructions per second.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Brookwood pointed out, most software hasn't changed much
in the last three years. Windows 98 and Windows 95 are
architecturally similar under the hood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Office 97 is not that much more of a power hog than Office 95
was,'' Brookwood said. ``Except maybe for games, there have been no
real new mainstream applications that stress the hardware.''
</P>
<P>
   Anita Haines, a retired geophysicist, recently set out to buy a
new computer. She'd budgeted between $1,800 and $2,000, but wound
up paying about half that for a 233-megahertz Packard Bell
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have bought a more expensive one, but I wanted to get
a Zip drive, better speakers, accessories and things like that,''
Haines said.
</P>
<P>
   She uses her computer for word processing, Internet access,
personal finance and low-level graphics. She produces a club
newsletter on her system.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, there's nothing I've found that it won't do,'' she
said. ``I'm very impressed with the speed, considering that I'm
moving up from a 486-66.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses also are finding that they can get along with less
than the state of the art.
</P>
<P>
   Michael S. Chung, director of Transworld Academy, a Houston
medical vocational school, recently walked into Office Depot and
came out with five $799 Presario computers for use in his offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I could have afforded more, but it was a good value,''
Chung said.
</P>
<P>
   The five computers are joined on a network at the school,
handling word-processing chores and sharing a database.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These are more than adequate for what we have to do,'' he
said. ``And they have open slots and room to expand. They're good
machines for the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardware companies insist that cases similar to Chung's are an
aberration. Most businesses continue to buy at the higher end of
the PC spectrum, said Ken Kurtzman, vice president for Compaq's
small and medium business division.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are demanding all the power we can give them,'' he said.
``Many small to medium businesses are using these computers to run
their entire business. They're doing their own marketing, and using
the computers to do complex graphics. They run their accounting
department on them, and a small business running its receivables on
a spreadsheet can rapidly turn it into a very big spreadsheet that
needs a lot of power to recalculate.''
</P>
<P>
   Other businesses are buying at the high end of the PC power
scale because they want to standardize on one design. If 20 people
in a building need a 400-megahertz Pentium II, it may be cheaper to
put that kind of computer on everyone's desk, rather than mix and
match different systems.
</P>
<P>
   Intel and other chip makers work with the makers of PCs to
market new and more powerful uses for personal computers, not
always with the most successful of results.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Intel has been pushing the use of PCs in desktop
video conferencing, a technology that requires both a powerful
computer and a fast connection to the Internet or a local network.
But users have found little to get excited about.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release titled ``Videoconference: A Technology
Solution Without an Obvious Problem,'' market research firm
International Data Corp. reported that most businesses did not
consider the technology a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survey findings clearly reveal that potential users are not
seeing videoconferencing as a necessity, and vendors are having
trouble making a compelling argument for the adoption of this
technology,'' the IDC report said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Alter, director of microprocessor marketing and business
planning at Intel, said she thinks videoconferencing will take off
_ someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think an application is going to be there, then someone
has to get out in front with that application,'' Alter said. ``If
it's not going to be us, then it's not going to be anyone else. We
might have been a little early with it, but I think you will see
this adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel also makes investments in the development of
non-processor-related technologies. For example, it's been heavily
involved in promoting new standards for faster Internet connections
into businesses and homes. That will make it easier for Intel to,
in turn, promote connection- and processor-intensive applications,
such as _ you guessed it _ videoconferencing
</P>
<P>
   One of the applications that does require a powerful computer is
gaming. While today's 3-D games will run well enough on systems
with year-old technology, they really scream on modern,
cutting-edge PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Both Intel and its chief chip rival, Advanced Micro Devices, or
AMD, have been courting computer gamers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, AMD has cozied up to the 3-D game community by
sponsoring the Professional Gamers League, an attempt to turn
computer gaming into a professional sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gamers always seem to be the early adopters _ the state of the
art is more important to them,'' said Ben Anixter, vice president
of external affairs at AMD.
</P>
<P>
   Because they require more sophisticated hardware to run at their
best, games are probably one of the most hardware-sensitive genres
for software development. Game developers walk a fine line between
being able to create a cool-looking game and ensuring there are
enough systems that can play it.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware and software developers try to keep on top of the
hardware vs. software cycle by tracking developments in each
other's arena. But it's not always easy. Hardware companies often
have problems getting their products out the door, as do software
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very good relationships with most of the hardware
vendors, from the 3-D chip makers to Intel,'' wrote John Carmack,
one of the co-founders of the Mesquite-based game company id
Software, in an e-mail. Id's most recent game, Quake II, is
considered to be one of the most challenging for any PC to run, and
computer and graphic card makers often include benchmarks derived
from the game as proof of their systems' capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Id currently is working on the third game in its Quake series,
to be called Quake III: Arena. Carmack has said it will require
even more computing and graphics horsepower than Quake II. And, he
hopes, the hardware will be on gamers' desks when the package is on
store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel provides very dependable road maps, but the 3-D chip
guys are a lot more like game companies _ `It will be done in six
months. Maybe. We hope.'''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: You think it's hot now
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (''Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in which readers share
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   The summer of 1998 will go down in the books as one of the
hottest on record. But Sarah T. Hayes of Longview, Texas, remembers
when summers seemed even hotter _ back before air-conditioning.
Here's her story:
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, there was a summer way of life. One had summer
clothes, food and ways of doing things to coexist with the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunate folks had water coolers in their windows, and the
whirling, gurgling sound of the fan and water contraption promised
a cooler interior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before air-conditioning, people did their work early in the
day, rested or coasted through the heat of the day and finished the
day at a summer-slow pace. Most things could wait until tomorrow
when _ who knows? _ it might cool off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fathers like mine wore lighter-weight business suits with a
short-sleeve white shirt and straw hats. The ubiquitous necktie was
there, but sometimes Pop carried his suit coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mama wore cotton dresses with open-toed shoes. We girls wore
shorts and tops, sandals or sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived in Dallas and as soon as school was out Mama would
start planning our annual visits to her relatives in smaller towns
all over Central and East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``First on the list would be Waco to see her father, who was
known locally as Big Thom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we might go to Aunt Mab in Cleburne, Uncle Al and Aunt
Lela in Palestine, and then on to Mama's sister Sue and her
husband, El Jay, in Longview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop would gallantly stay behind in Dallas to work and hold
down the fort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our normally quiet and unassuming mother would become the
fearless leader of those grand expeditions. For us city kids,
little towns were foreign soil indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mama's relatives were not quite as sophisticated as Pop's
were, but, oh, how I remember the love and the laughter amid the
vast quantities of delicious food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drool a bit as I recall really fresh fried chicken, corn on
the cob, cakes, berry cobblers and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had room left, there was drippy, juicy watermelon on
the back porch where one could spit seeds out _ if Mama was busy
talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going barefoot in grass that had stickers and grass
burrs to make you hop and holler, but that was better than the
sidewalks that charbroiled tender soles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember we kids hated having to stop playing to come inside
to rest. I know now that mothers worried about polio and heat
strokes. We thought that naps were for babies and the elderly, not
for regular kids like us. We must have been a handful, even though
we look sweet in the old photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``One summer my sister and I tried to fry eggs on the sidewalk
in front of Big Thom's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have worked if we had not been missed and, thus,
caught in the act. Compounding our crime was the fact that we not
only sneaked out of the house when we were supposed to be napping
but, the worst part, that we stole eggs from our grandfather's
prized Rhode Island Reds out in the chicken house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we will never know for sure if the radio was right,
that you could fry eggs on the sidewalk that summer in Waco so long
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only now that I realize that we were able to see Texas
cities before they outgrew themselves, and the little towns at
their Southern Americana best.''

MINDING THE COURT'S LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, Aug. 16.)  
 (Eds., items in boldface should be set in italics.)  
 (HLW)  
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Justices of the Supreme Court may hand down the final word on
the law, but they cannot offer the final word on the words. That's
for all of us to hash out (cf. Marbury vs. Safire).
</P>
<P>
   In concurring with the court's decision to refuse to hear a case
brought by unendowed ``performance artists'' against the National
Endowment for the Arts, a testy Antonin Scalia took aim at the
language of the statute controlling that federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   The law reads: ``Artistic excellence and artistic merit are the
criteria by which applications are judged,  &UR; taking into
consideration general standards for decency and respect for the
diverse beliefs and values of the American public &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia took a bead on the portion of the law I italicized. That,
he wrote, ``is what my grammar-school teacher would have condemned
as a dangling modifier. There is no noun to which the participle is
attached. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that our lawmakers erred in their draftsmanship?
Yes. The solipsistic solons, in choosing to modify the first part
of that sentence, should have recast it to provide a subject
anchor. ``Judges should judge applications using the criteria of
artistic excellence and artistic merit, taking into consideration,
etc.'' Scalia's grammar-school teacher, whose strict
constructionism apparently influenced the future jurist, was
correct.
</P>
<P>
   Later in this decidedly grouchy concurrence, Scalia directed
attention to the meaning of a participle properly connected to a
noun in the First Amendment: ``Congress shall make no law ...
 &UR; abridging &LR;  the freedom of speech.'' ( &UR; Law &LR;  is the noun that is
being modified;  &UR; abridging &LR; , the participial modifier.)
</P>
<P>
   ``To abridge is `to contract, to diminish; to deprive of,'''
wrote the justice, giving as the source for that definition ``T.
Sheridan, A Complete Dictionary of the English Language (6th ed.
1796).'' He went on to opine that denial of taxpayer subsidy was no
 &UR; abridgment &LR;  of speech, but the question to lexicographers is: Why
did a justice in 1998 use a 1796 dictionary? Can't the court afford
a new one?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: In examining the Founders' intent, you are wise to use
the definitions they turned to at the time. In 1789, when James
Madison drafted the Bill of Rights, Noah Webster had not yet
produced an American dictionary. A school dictionary was in print
that had no authority in terms of meaning, but the great,
authoritative Samuel Johnson dictionary did not cross the Atlantic
until 1818 in its 11th edition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scalia, or whoever did the research for him,'' says Fred Mish,
editor-in-chief of Merriam-Webster, ``chose from a group of four
dictionaries from that period available here, all British, that all
focused on pronunciation: John Entwick's, William Perry's, John
Walker's and Thomas Sheridan's. Sheridan was an Irishman and a
stage actor (as was Walker) and probably based his work on his
stage elocution.''
</P>
<P>
   Today,  &UR; abridge &LR;  still has a sense of ``diminish,'' but its
primary meaning is ``shorten, condense.'' The meaning of
``deprive'' is now considered archaic, but that is what the
Founders had in mind. They may have found it in the dictionary at
hand, which was primarily concerned with pronunciation, not
meaning. More likely, they took its sense of ``constrain'' from the
works of John Locke, popular with Constitution writers and later
cited by Johnson: ``The constant desire of happiness, and the
constraint it puts upon us, no body, I think, accounts an
 &UR; abridgment &LR;  of liberty. ...''
</P>
<P>
   If you think that's splitting hairs, at least it deals with what
to some of us is the most important word in the Constitution. Turn
now to the lengths to which Justices Stephen Breyer, writing for
the majority, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose dissent was joined by
Rehnquist, Souter and Scalia (presumably still thumbing his
Sheridan), went in debating the meaning of a fairly common verb:
 &UR; to carry &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In Muscarello vs. U.S., the issue was whether the phrase
 &UR; carries a firearm &LR;  meant only ``bears on your person'' or could be
interpreted to mean ``transports in the trunk or glove compartment
of your car.'' The broader construction meant jail for the
defendant.
</P>
<P>
   ``...  &UR; carry &LR;  is a word commonly used to convey various
messages,'' argued Ginsburg (subtly using  &UR; convey &LR;  to make her
point), which she illustrated with this multifaceted passage from
the television series ``MASH'' in which Hawkeye Pierce, played by
Alan Alda, proclaims: ``I will not carry a gun. ... I'll carry your
books, I'll carry a torch, I'll carry a tune, I'll carry on, carry
over, carry forward, Cary Grant, cash and carry, carry me back to
Old Virginia, I'll even `hari-kari' if you show me how, but I will
not carry a gun!''
</P>
<P>
   Only two were deemed relevant by Breyer. ``When one uses the
word in the first, or primary, meaning, one can, as a matter of
ordinary English, `carry firearms' in a wagon, car, truck or other
vehicle that one accompanies. When one used the word in a
different, rather special, way,'' held Breyer, who is heavily into
commas, ``to mean, for example, `bearing' or (in slang) `packing'
(as in `packing a gun') the matter is less clear.''
</P>
<P>
   In my view, that is the meaning Mae West had in mind when she
said: ``Is that a gun in your pocket or are you just glad to see
me.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology to show how the
primary meaning includes conveyance in a vehicle: the Latin  &UR; carum &LR; 
means ``car'' and ``cart,'' and since 1896 we have used car to mean
``automobile.'' He cited II Kings 9:28 in the King James Bible:
``His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem,'' and updated
it with a New York Times clip about an ``ex-con'' who ``arrives
home driving a stolen car and carrying a load of handguns.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the 26th definition of  &UR; carry &LR;  in the Oxford English
Dictionary, wrote Breyer, was directed to the special meaning that
the defense used to narrow the meaning of the law: ``to bear, wear,
hold up, or sustain, as one moves about; habitually to bear about
with one.'' In the opinion handed down by the Supreme Court of the
United States, ``the word `carry' in its ordinary sense includes
carrying in a car and that the word, used in its ordinary sense,
keeps the same meaning whether one carries a gun, a suitcase, or a
banana.''

CAUGHT BETWEEN PARCHED EARTH AND DRY HEAVENS, RANCHER WAITS FOR
BETTER DAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ One day last week the clouds were finally
different, and when they do change, Jack Birdwell is among the
first to notice.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife, Billie, married into the ranching life 21 years
ago, she could not believe how much time Jack spent studying the
sky, as if he tried to parse out the meaning of every cloud, like a
sage over tea leaves. But she soon came to understand why Jack got
in the lifelong habit of looking up: Those clouds decided his
ranching fate.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while pouring cement for a cattle scale, Jack Birdwell
sees what he has been looking for _ pregnant, billowing clouds,
some bordered in dark blue, dressing up the northwest sky. It's
been too long.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's historic drought has already drained many of
Birdwell's stock tanks and burned up the grasses of his pastures.
He and other Texas ranchers, no longer able to feed their herds,
are selling off cows, driving market prices to the basement,
causing the spiral of catastrophe to continue. All this because of
bleached-out skies and wispy, worthless clouds.
</P>
<P>
   But Birdwell's family has been in ranching for a century, and
during that time droughts have always ended. That is the value of
experience. Things always change. The puffy clouds he sees are a
welcome reminder that even in this terrible summer of 1998, that
will certainly be true again.
</P>
<P>
   SOMETIMES THERE'S GLAMOUR. NOT THIS YEAR: Birdwell drives from
his spacious ranch home and eventually turns off the blacktop of
Palo Pinto County back roads 80 miles northwest of Fort Worth. He
inches along bumpy dirt trails that traverse his land. Usually he,
Billie and teen-age son Jay come here on horseback to count and
tend to young cattle, nursing them through the critical period of
the first year when the animals are most prone to illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're fresh weaned, they're pretty skittish, and they
won't be where you can see them,'' Jack Birdwell says. ``And if
they're sick, they're not going to be laying where you can see
them. So you've got to ride and look in the spots that a pickup
can't get to.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like such fun to a city dweller, riding after cattle,
and it's hard not to envy Birdwell, who has been riding a horse
since he was old enough to walk. As a boy, he followed his father
into the pastures every day, and never really considered doing
anything else with his life. He was drawn by the tradition begun by
his grandfather, by a deep attachment to the cedar and
mesquite-studded land, the freedom, working outside. But the
romance is deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, when the weather's pretty, and you don't find any
sick cattle, when it's all working in the right direction, then
everything's fine. It's enjoyable,'' Jack Birdwell says. ``But when
it's raining straight down and it's 35 degrees out there, you've
got to do it anyway. Or the fog's so thick that you can't see in
front of your face, you've still got to find them. All the glamour
has gone out if it then.''
</P>
<P>
   And all the glamour has gone out of it now. It is midafternoon
as the pickup bumps along, another day when the temperature climbs
past 100. The land is brown and dead. Two lethargic young cows
kneel in the shade of a live oak, a scene illustrating the
rancher's dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want out in this heat any more than people do,''
Jack Birdwell says of his cattle. ``They won't eat. You'll catch
them grazing until maybe 8:30 in the morning, then they'll shade up
for the rest of the day. More than likely, it's not until 6:30 or 7
at night before they'll come out, and they won't have but an hour
or an hour and a half to graze, unless the moon's up.''
</P>
<P>
   In other years, when rain is more plentiful, the heat less
intense and the grass knee-high, cows graze all day, fattening
themselves up for sale and the slaughterhouse. This year, cattle
are losing weight, and every pound lost is money from the rancher's
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Birdwell pulls to a stop in a broad pasture, watched by dozens
of other cattle that linger in the shade. He steps from the truck
onto brown, burnt grass that is crisp beneath his boot. Grass that
has lost its green color has also lost its protein, he says, so he
must hand-feed his herd protein supplements, adding to his costs.
</P>
<P>
   Across the pasture lies a dried, sun-baked patch of mud that
used to be a stock tank. The mud is cracked and broken and
resembles a jigsaw puzzle. There are occasional deep gouges where
cattle have tried to trudge through the muck toward what was left
of the water. Stagnant water left in the tanks has made Birdwell's
calves sick.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Another nearby tank is also dwindling fast. Without rain,
Birdwell will not have enough water to get his herd through the
winter and will have to sell more cattle.
</P>
<P>
   He also fears an infestation of grasshoppers. Range fires nip at
his land. The grim litany of this summer goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we got to thinking about it,'' Billie Birdwell says,
smiling in the hot sun, ``we might get depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you find yourself talking to yourself,'' her husband
says.
</P>
<P>
   HE FINALLY SEES HOPE: Jack Birdwell checks the cattle markets
twice a day, and this summer the news has always been bad. The
drought and heat have decimated hay crops, forcing ranchers to sell
cattle they won't be able to feed in winter. Largely as a result, a
cow and calf that might have brought $700 just last winter might be
worth $500 now, Birdwell says. He's gone below the break-even point
on most of his stock.
</P>
<P>
   But he still sleeps better than his wife does. Birdwell was
raised in a life where ranchers often lived on the edge of
calamity. Billie is the daughter of a butane company owner in
nearby Mineral Wells, and far less accustomed to the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just know it's going to get better,'' Jack Birdwell says.
``It always has; it will again.''
</P>
<P>
   On his way from the pastures, he drives to the top of a hill for
a bit of sightseeing. Far below is the Brazos River as it snakes
through a broad valley. The country is beautiful from here.
</P>
<P>
   And in the sky, Jack Birdwell finally sees hope _ big, puffy,
pregnant clouds building across the prairie sky he has studied all
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something's broken up,'' he says of the sky. ``These clouds
are trying. It looks more promising than anything we've had in
days.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, his ranch will receive a good rain.

PERSONAL HEALTH: ONE MAN'S FACT, ANOTHER MAN'S FOLLY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To paraphrase P.T. Barnum, there's a study born every minute,
and there are countless suckers out there ready to believe anything
they hear or read. Many people make significant changes in what
they eat, drink, take or do based on research that is far from
conclusive. Some become unduly alarmed about suspected but unproved
risks to health, especially ones in the air, water or food supply,
that they cannot control. Others decide that because what is
``fact'' one week is sometimes contradicted by a new study finding
the next, they won't change any habit until ``the scientists make
up their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of confusion is understandable given two facts of
modern life. First, fed in part by media attention to health
issues, the public's concern about health and demand for health
information has increased significantly in recent decades. Second,
few people, including many who report health findings in print or
on the air, know how to interpret scientific research or understand
the certainties _ and uncertainties _ inherent in different kinds
of studies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, what medical researchers may report as an ``association''
often becomes a cause-and-effect relationship in the minds of
readers and listeners. Or what takes place in a test tube or
laboratory mouse is automatically assumed to apply to humans as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should view health news skeptically and critically,''
said Dr. Scott Emerson, biostatistician at the University of
Washington in Seattle. ``It's important to realize how many
variables there are in medical research and look for details that
help illustrate the significance of the findings.''
</P>
<P>
   So before you switch back to butter, start gobbling supplements
or give up coffee, look beyond the scary headlines and broadcast
bulletins and try to find out just how solid the new ``facts'' are.
To know when to act on research findings and when to sit tight, you
must first determine what kind of study is involved and recognize
its potential pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   The following types of research investigations are described in
the order of how certain you can be that their findings can be
generally applied.
</P>
<P>
   Laboratory experiments _ These studies are done to suggest a
possible hazard or benefit of a substance or circumstance or to
elaborate on observations that have been made in people. They are
carried out either ``in vitro'' _ that is, on cells or tissue
samples in an actual or proverbial test tube, or ``in vivo'' _ in
laboratory animals like mice, rats or guinea pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of such studies is that they can be tightly
controlled. The scientist can be sure, for example, that comparison
groups are genetically identical and the conditions to which they
are exposed (except for the factor being studied) are identical.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a long way from the test tube or laboratory mouse to
man or woman. The fact that all people do not have the same genes,
hormones, metabolism or life circumstances may greatly modify the
effects. Or human biology may be such that whatever happens in a
test tube or lower animal would not apply to us. Thus, for example,
laboratory studies indicated that saccharin may cause cancer in
mice, but no reliable study in people has yet borne that out.
</P>
<P>
   Epidemiological research _ These are observational studies, and
they are the origin of most of the health reports you are likely to
hear. They are also fraught with pitfalls. They cannot establish
cause and effect; they can only suggest a relationship between two
factors or events. These kinds of studies are commonly used to
ferret out possible risks or preventives for diseases, for example,
high cholesterol as a risk factor for heart disease or vitamin E
supplements to prevent Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Epidemiological studies are best at identifying very powerful
associations, like the one between smoking and lung cancer. When
the relationship between factors is weaker, like the link between
alcohol and breast cancer, epidemiological studies are less helpful
and often produce contradictory results. Also, the larger the study
and the longer it has been carried out, the more certain you can be
of the findings, because researchers can better account for factors
that could lead to a spurious conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Observational studies are of two main types: case-control
studies and cohort studies. In a case-control study, researchers
compare factors found among people with a certain disease to
factors among a comparable group of people without that disease.
Thus, a study of people with ulcers revealed that infection with
the bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, was far more common among them
than in people without ulcers. But doctors could not be certain the
bacterium was a cause until they showed that curing the infection
could cure ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   In a cohort study, large groups of people are followed for a
long time. Researchers try to identify factors _ possible causes
and preventives _ associated with illnesses that develop over time.
Among the most helpful of these studies has been the 45-year-old
Framingham Heart Study and the huge Nurses Health Study. By
adjusting their data statistically to account for the influence of
extraneous factors that might confound the findings, researchers
can often zero in on important associations, like a much lower
death rate from heart disease and a small increase in breast cancer
risk among women who take postmenopausal estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical trials _ A study that randomly assigns people to two
treatment groups, with neither the researchers nor the participants
knowing which group is which until the study is completed, is the
gold standard of scientific research. To be sure that estrogen
replacement and not some other characteristic of women who choose
to take hormones, is responsible for their lower risk of heart
disease, women must be randomly assigned to take hormones or a
look-alike placebo, then followed for years to determine their
fate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every suspected association can be subjected to a
clinical trial. Given the overwhelming evidence for the risks of
smoking, it would be unethical to assign one group to smoke and
another to never smoke just to prove that smoking causes cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, regardless of the kind of study you are examining, it
is important to appreciate the most fundamental fact of medical
research: A single study does not a fact make. No matter how
reputable the scientist or the institution where the research was
done, no matter how compelling the findings appear to be, they must
be confirmed by one or more independent studies before scientists
will accept them as gospel. In fact, it often takes many studies
that examine an issue from different angles with increasing degrees
of certainty to convince well-informed researchers and public
health advisers that it is time to act on the conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Emerson put it, ``Each study a researcher performs is
just a small step. It takes many small steps to build a significant
understanding.''

<P>
   Q. What determines the color of clouds?
</P>
<P>
   A. A cloud's color depends chiefly on its own relationship to
the light of the sun, said Todd Miner, a meteorologist at
Pennsylvania State University. In some cases, it depends on the
color of the surrounding sky.
</P>
<P>
   If a cloud covers the whole visible area of the sky, the depth
of the cloud determines the color of the cloud; the deeper it is,
the darker it is. As a ray of sunlight impinges on the cloud, the
water in the cloud can either reflect the light back toward space
or absorb the light, Miner explained. Either effect will dilute the
strength of the sunlight that gets through.
</P>
<P>
   If the wavelengths of the sun's visible light, in the familiar
red-to-violet spectrum, are not blocked, but scattered equally, the
result is white light, Miner said. So, if the sun is shining and
the cloud is not covering the sun, in general the cloud is white.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes particles in the atmosphere and the angle of the path
the sun's rays must travel through it can result in preferential
scattering of wavelengths so that a particular color, like gold,
predominates in a cloud, Miner said. This is the same reason the
sky is predominantly blue, because the blue wavelengths are the
most scattered.

DETECTIVE TRACKS CHILDREN ABDUCTED BY BITTER PARENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The detective picks up the ringing telephone. ``Praise
the Lord. May I help you?''
</P>
<P>
   Every case Mark Miller investigates begins this way, with a
single call. And after 11 years in the business of rescuing
abducted kids, Miller gets lots of calls.
</P>
<P>
   He's the guy who can find children when police can't. He's the
guy who will travel to Germany or Lebanon or Hawaii when police
won't. He's the guy who will do it _ and do it for free.
</P>
<P>
   He's a sort of detective, an amateur sleuth with more than 100
happy endings in his files. Miller inserts himself into the ugliest
of domestic situations _ custody battles _ because he thinks
somebody should. He thinks a child belongs at home, safe from a
life on the run, safe from hiding and lies.
</P>
<P>
   So nearly every day, his telephone rings.
</P>
<P>
   When it rang in January 1996, Jeff Luke was on the other end,
calling from Fort Worth. Jeff and his wife had divorced: He got
custody of their 2-year-old son; she got weekend visitation.
Harriet Brown picked up little Jeffrey on April 19, 1995 _ but she
never returned.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is picky about the cases he takes, and he told Luke that
over the telephone. Miller requires clients to fill out an 11-page
questionnaire and provide a divorce decree, custody paperwork,
family pictures, a felony warrant. He works closely with police,
and they arrest the abductor after he finds the child.
</P>
<P>
   While Miller studies the case, he sends a video for Luke to
study him.
</P>
<P>
   It opens with a chorus of tiny voices singing ``Jesus Loves the
Little Children.'' Then Miller appears. He is over 6 feet tall,
built like a basketball player, and he is in airports and parking
lots, surrounded by television cameras, reuniting sobbing parents
with overwhelmed kids.
</P>
<P>
   There he is on ``Hard Copy'' and ``Inside Edition'' and ``A
Current Affair.'' There he is on ``CNN Live With Larry King'' and
``48 Hours'' and ``Good Morning Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   The videotape reveals why Miller has a can-do reputation. Here
are his triumphs: Rescuing Ramzy and Nora in Lebanon, Sophia in
Virginia, Robert in Florida, Eric in Texas; bringing Andre,
Kimberly, Mark, Tony and Rachel back from Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   What the video doesn't explain is why Miller quit selling mobile
homes and trading stocks. It doesn't explain why he quit paying his
mortgage and car payment and slept on the couch in a rental house
and ate peanut butter sandwiches to start his nonprofit
organization, the American Association for Lost Children Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``I wanted to help people,'' Miller says.
</P>
<P>
   He was 29 years old, he says, when recurring dreams of demons
led him to see his was an empty life. He put aside the Catholicism
he grew up with as a boy outside Pittsburgh, and he embraced the
faith of a nondenominational Bible church in Houston. He needed
meaning. He found it finding kids.
</P>
<P>
   Miller paid for his early efforts with bake sales, carwashes and
a golf tournament. Most of his income was derived from selling M&AMP;M
candies and lemonade at a Wal-Mart. Today, he pays a staff of four
through donations and a string of bubble-gum vending machines in
several states. He spends some on travel and spy gadgets, like
two-way radios and bugging devices.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, when Jeff Luke called, Miller had honed his
investigating skills. He started with tips from a retired private
eye, he learned more on the job, and he sought inspiration in every
case, asking, ``Lord, what should we do next?''
</P>
<P>
   Miller has picked through trash for utility bills and tattered
checks. He has delivered pizzas and flowers to peek behind closed
doors. He played lost in North Carolina, he pretended to buy
property in Texas, and in one case, he and a partner followed a
Florida grandparent to a telephone booth where she called a missing
mother in Tennessee. While Miller created a distraction, his
partner looked over the woman's shoulder as she dialed the number.
</P>
<P>
   Miller learned to pass the time on stakeouts by reading his
black leather Bible and listening to Scripture tapes, the way he
did in Arkansas, on the trail of little Jeffrey Luke.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   When he took the case almost four years ago, the search began at
an Irving apartment where the boy's mother lived with her sister.
Two of Miller's employees, a 76-year-old white woman and a black
woman in her 30s, knocked on apartment doors, pretending to
distribute religious tracts. The guise worked, and they got inside.
The boy was gone, and the sister was eliminated from the trail.
</P>
<P>
   They traveled to Little Rock, where other relatives lived. After
staking out brothers and sisters, the last resort was to go
undercover.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was for a 13-year-old girl, the daughter of one of
Miller's workers, to pose as a new kid in the neighborhood. Miller
watched from a rental car as the girl and her mother struck up a
conversation at the bus stop with little Jeffrey's aunt and cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The ruse worked, and the girl made friends with the cousin. The
two stayed in touch by telephone after Miller returned to Houston.
During one of those conversations, the girl in Arkansas mentioned a
boy cousin who lived with a grandmother out in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The tip led Miller to Holly Grove, population 180, to a house
down a two-lane road, in an area surrounded by rice fields and
swamp marshes and not much else.
</P>
<P>
   On April 26, 1996 _ 370 days after Jeffrey didn't come home _
Miller met Jeff Luke at the Little Rock airport. Miller had found
the boy. But the case was not in the data base and there was no
felony arrest warrant to give police.
</P>
<P>
   They prayed at the airport. ``Lord, let him be somewhere outside
where he can pick him up.''
</P>
<P>
   When Miller and Luke reached the house, little Jeffrey was
there, sitting on the bottom step, his little hands in his little
lap, like he was waiting. The father grabbed his son as the mother
stormed out the door. She swung a tree branch until the detective
intervened. The grandmother threw stones as the car rolled down the
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would still be missing Jeffrey if it were not for Mark
Miller and his people,'' Jeff Luke says. ``I couldn't even begin to
pay him back for what he's done. He has brought my son back to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how most cases end. This, Miller says, is why he puts up
with the dangers, like the time he was detained in El Salvador, the
time he was jailed in Mexico, the time his car was searched in
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   He started rescuing stolen kids because his ``heart was
churning.'' But as he sits in his office, surrounded by posters,
some covered with the words ``Bless God! Another Found!'' Miller
says his heart is churning again.
</P>
<P>
   He has traveled to the Philippines for missionary work. He has
mailed boxes of used clothes to poor families in Africa. He
recently returned from China, where he smuggled matchbook-size
Bibles to underground Christian churches.
</P>
<P>
   He will be 40 in November, and his spiky hair is faintly gray.
He is contemplating the future when the telephone rings, and the
detective is back on a case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Praise the Lord!,'' Miller says. ``Can I help you?''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new word is edging into the study of human genetics: the snip.
</P>
<P>
   Snips, variations in the DNA that make each individual unique,
are the genetic determinants of health and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Now, because of machines that rapidly decode DNA, the chemical
chain that embodies the genetic instructions, snips are becoming
more accessible and more highly prized.
</P>
<P>
   Snips promise to yield two troves of information, one past and
one present.
</P>
<P>
   They will help population geneticists reconstruct the size and
timing of the early human migrations that peopled the globe. And
they should enable medical geneticists to trace elusive links
between genes and disease, particularly the common diseases to
which many genes contribute. With the use of snips, pharmaceutical
companies hope to match drugs more precisely to an individual's
unique genetic makeup.
</P>
<P>
   The search for snips is an essential counterpart to the human
genome project, the attempt to decode or sequence all three billion
letters of human DNA in the next five to seven years. The human
genome project largely ignores the variations in DNA that make each
person unique.
</P>
<P>
   Based on analyzing the DNA of just a few individuals, it will
provide a consensus sequence, meaning the DNA letter that is most
commonly found at each of the three billion positions on the DNA
chain.
</P>
<P>
   Though the consensus sequence is of great interest to biologists
trying to figure out the operation of the human genetic
programming, medical geneticists are interested in the variations
from the consensus because in them lies the answer as to why one
person may succumb to a disease and another resist it.
</P>
<P>
   The number of variations among 6 billion humans might seem
impossibly large because in principle every letter in the genome
can change, whether by chemical decay, a hit from stray radiation
or a copying error. But in fact the variation is much more limited,
with changes being commonly found only at particular sites in the
DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that by evolution's standards the human species is
very young, a mere 100,000 years or so, and at about that time went
through a population bottleneck of some 10,000 individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blink of an eye since we left Africa hasn't been long
enough to build up many common variations,'' said Dr. Eric S.
Lander, the principal proponent of the snip chip. ``We have the
level of variation expected from 10,000 people because we are just
a little population that happened to grow big.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the medically interesting variations in DNA are in the
form of single changes to a nucleotide, the chemical units that
make up the DNA chain. Changes that are commonly found, meaning in
at least 1 percent of a population, are known as SNPs, or single
nucleotide polymorphisms.
</P>
<P>
   SNPs, pronounced snips, can exert dramatic effects. Sickle cell
anemia is caused solely by the change of an A to a T (A, T, C and G
are the symbols for the four chemical letters, or nucleotides, that
make up the DNA alphabet) in one of the genes that specifies the
hemoglobin protein of the red blood cells. Three variant spellings
in the gene known as apolipoprotein E account for much of the risk
for Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   SNP's occur in roughly one out of every 500 positions along the
DNA chain. Because only 3 percent of the genome appears to be
active in the body, the rest being generally of no known purpose,
there are only some 200,000 snips in the genes that specify the
working parts of the body's cells.
</P>
<P>
   The effective human genetic repertoire is apparently limited to
combinations, very large though their number is, of this finite
number of variations.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists pursuing snips in parallel with the decoding of the
human genome are headed in two main directions. One is the effort
to measure how genetic variation is distributed around the globe,
information that will help track prehistoric human migrations.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Genome Diversity Project, headed by Luca
Cavalli-Sforza of Stanford University, aims to collect DNA from at
least 100 populations on each continent. Unfortunately, the project
has been held up by objections that it would exploit the people who
donated samples.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent review, a panel convened by the National Academy of
Sciences endorsed the goals of the project but said more work
should be done to address ethical concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The other major use of snips is in tracing the genetic
variations that contribute to health and disease. Diseases caused
by defects in a single gene have been easy enough to trace because
they are inherited in the simple patterns first described by Gregor
Mendel, the founder of genetics, in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   But these Mendelian diseases tend to be quite rare. Most common
maladies, like heart disease and schizophrenia, are thought to be
caused by the defective versions of many genes acting in concert.
</P>
<P>
   Because each gene makes only a minor contribution to the
disease, it is hard for geneticists to trace its effects even when
they have large family pedigrees to work with.
</P>
<P>
   The current method of mapping the human genome depends on the
same kind of signpost or marker that is used in the forensic
technique of DNA fingerprinting. But these markers, which consist
of repetitive bits of DNA repeated a varying number of times in
different individuals, are technically difficult to work with. So
far, there has been very little success in digging out the genetic
roots of multi-gene diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, considerable interest was aroused by a recent calculation
that multi-gene diseases could be cracked with enough snips. Its
authors, Neil Risch of Stanford University and Kathleen Merikangas
of Yale, said that a simple association study _ comparing people
with and without a given disease _ would help pinpoint the
contributory genes if enough snips could be identified along the
DNA chain so as to give a reasonable chance of one being in or near
the causative genes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   After the Risch-Merikangas paper was presented, Dr. Francis S.
Collins, director of the human genome project at the National
Institutes of Health, persuaded the directors of other NIH
divisions to join in financing a grand hunt for snips, based on the
premise that genetic factors contribute to almost every human
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt began last January, at a cost of $10 million a year and
with the goal of locating at least 100,000 snips spread out across
the genome, which Collins calculates is the necessary number to tag
most genes of possible interest.
</P>
<P>
   Snips are also the basis of a fashionable new approach to drug
design known as pharmacogenomics. The premise is that people
respond differently to drugs based on their genetic makeup. With
the use of snips, it should be possible to tailor drugs to
patients, selecting the drug that works best for a person and
excluding from drug trials the people likely to suffer side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   If the approach works, drug companies might end up selling fewer
drugs, but could charge more for the tailored approach. Last year
Abbott Laboratories made a $20 million deal with Genset, a
Paris-based company, to discover 60,000 SNP's spread across the
genome.
</P>
<P>
   Once the snips are identified, they can be used for many
purposes. A particularly striking application is that of the snip
chip being developed by Lander.
</P>
<P>
   There may be some six million snips strung along the human
genome, all of which could be useful markers for tagging nearby
genes. But only the 200,000 that occur within the genes or coding
regions of DNA are likely to affect the individual in any way.
</P>
<P>
   One of several promising approaches in the search for snips is a
remarkable chip, made in a similar way to computer chips, that can
be programmed to scan the DNA chain for specific sequences of
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Chips are being developed by biologists at the Whitehead
Institute in Boston and at Affymetrix in Santa Clara, Calif., with
the purpose of scanning a person's whole DNA or genome for all
medically significant snips.
</P>
<P>
   The number of potentially significant snips is small enough that
a single chip, or set of chips, could be programmed to recognize
all 200,000 coding region snips, Lander believes.
</P>
<P>
   Such a chip could, in effect, sequence a person's genome in
minutes by identifying all significant differences from the
consensus sequence. It would also provide a kind of fate map,
enabling a physician to assess the genetic strength of a person's
constitution, the diseases to which they were vulnerable and
perhaps their likely longevity.
</P>
<P>
   At present, of course, the 200,000 coding snips are far from
being identified, let alone understood in terms of their medical
significance. Still, the snip chip is already under way. In May,
Lander and his colleagues described a chip that can analyze 500
snips simultaneously with reasonable accuracy, and a 2,000-snip
chip is also in development.
</P>
<P>
   Lander views his concept of a whole genome chip as more a
diagnostic than a predictive tool. People can already forecast
their medical fate pretty accurately by noting their parents' ages
and causes of death, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The snip chip ``is a way of teasing apart the causes of disease
rather than predicting the future,'' Lander said. ``For every spot
on the chip you need information and understanding, and that will
take a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   As that understanding is acquired, however, the chips seem
likely to intensify the existing problems of human genetics, such
as how to counsel patients and how to insure that the information
is not used to their detriment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very major ethical issue, and ELSI has already
decided to make this its highest priority,'' Collins said,
referring to the branch of the human genome project that studies
its ethical and legal consequences. ``This ability to collect very
large amounts of variation on individuals will be quickly upon us.
It will empower people to take advantage of preventive strategies,
but it could also be a nightmare of discriminatory information that
could be used against people.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the links between snips and disease may prove more
elusive than expected. A recent analysis of a gene that regulates
fat metabolism and is thought to play a role in heart disease
turned up an unexpectedly complex pattern of snips among the three
populations surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern makes it less certain that association studies
between snips and genes will pinpoint the genes involved in
disease, said Dr. Andrew G. Clark of Pennsylvania State University,
one of the authors of the study.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the current issue of Genome Research, Dr.
Kenneth M. Weiss, also of Penn State, warns of ``unrealistic
expectations of the questions that can be answered from genetic
data.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss notes that evolution acts on the phenotype, not the
genotype, meaning on the organism that is produced from the genes,
not the genes themselves. Although the genes carry a message as
precise as the digital code of a computer program, the phenotype is
tolerant of variation and survives with as wide a range of genetic
instructions as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the link between genes and people may be somewhat
fuzzier, Weiss suggests, than the crispness of a DNA sequence would
suggest.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The humble microbe E. coli showed up all green and evil on the
cover of Time magazine recently and made it official: This is
becoming the year of the germ.
</P>
<P>
   During the winter the public got a crash course in anthrax and
plague, putative weapons of biological warfare past and future. In
the spring, the news swung around to E. coli 0157:H7 in ground
beef, cheese and swimming pools, salmonella in breakfast cereal and
cryptosporidium on fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Antibacterial goo has appeared for sale in the vegetable aisle
of the supermarket; a local New York television station ushered in
the summer with a cheery two-part series on coliform contamination
of the city's soft ice-cream machines.
</P>
<P>
   Newsworthy infections have been attracting so much fanfare this
year that we have yet to hear a fitting recessional for the handful
of great infections of history that are slowly fading from view.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta recorded 138 confirmed cases of measles in the United
States. There were 612 reported cases of mumps, 161 of German
measles, scattered hundreds of the vicious childhood meningitis
caused by the Hemophilus influenzae bacterium that only 10 years
ago still left thousands of children deaf or mentally retarded each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Before vaccination against these common childhood diseases
became routine, case numbers ran to tens or hundreds of thousands a
year; no ordinary American doctor could get through a year of
practice without seeing them all.
</P>
<P>
   Now, no ordinary American doctor is likely to run into any of
them ever again. Along with diphtheria, cholera and polio they all
still roam the world _ but not here, not any more.
</P>
<P>
   Except in the classrooms and lecture halls of the country's
medical schools, that is, where the professors are trying to figure
out what to keep in their curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks, Dr. Franklin D. Lowy, a professor of medicine at
the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, will begin to
plan the microbiology and infectious diseases course that the class
of 2001, now second-year medical students, will study next winter
and spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know what the students should learn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The long lecture segments on measles and German measles _ should
Lowy keep them intact, condense them, or discard them completely
and tell the students to read their textbooks instead? The hour
lecture devoted to Hemophilus influenzae and its relatives _ should
it be kept, abbreviated or given over to E. coli and the other
intestinal infections so often in the news this year?
</P>
<P>
   What about Howie S., an imaginary young man exposed to measles
on a hospital ward, that Einstein instructors have used to teach
about the transmission and diagnosis of measles? Is Howie still
worth a dedicated half-hour of classroom time?
</P>
<P>
   Medical students do learn vital lessons about patterns of
infection and the ways microbes cause disease by studying classic
diseases they will never see, Lowy said. Hence the sacrosanct hour
devoted to leprosy in his course (109 new cases of leprosy were
diagnosed in the United States last year).
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the medical student is nothing if not a
supremely pragmatic organism. Faced with mountains of details to
learn, students are merciless at finding the chaff. Last year, an
Einstein student greeted the happy news of the imminent departure
of measles from her purview with a roll of her eyes and a slam of
her pen right down on the obsolescent case of Howie S.
</P>
<P>
   ``So then why don't they teach us things we need to know
instead?'' she said to general applause.
</P>
<P>
   The question of what infections an American doctor will need to
know in the year 2001 is not an easy one to answer. The world has
become too small to call any of the diseases that are disappearing
from the United States really extinct.
</P>
<P>
   They all still roar through other countries with enough ferocity
that they will continue to trickle into ours: diphtheria from
Eastern Europe, German measles from Central and South America,
measles from Africa and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as medical students may sense with a surer instinct than
their professors, doctors need to focus on the patients directly in
front of them, not those half a world away. Our society's new
microbes are clamoring for time and attention too.
</P>
<P>
   The organism called chlamydia caused almost half a million
infections here last year, and some evidence now connects it with
heart attacks as well. Should a share of the lecture time for
measles be handed over to chlamydia? Or should it go to
Helicobacter pylori, the newly discovered bacterial cause of
stomach ulcers?
</P>
<P>
   Or to the tick-borne bacteria called Ehrlichia that can fatally
poison the bone marrow; or the Sin Nombre viruses that cause a
fatal pneumonia; or a whole new species of bacteria, called the
nanobacteria, that may be responsible for many kidney stones?
</P>
<P>
   New forms of venerable bacteria like the pneumococcus are
resistant to more and more antibiotics; when should the students
start hearing less about polio and cholera and more about all of
them?
</P>
<P>
   The germs are all out there, knocking at Lowy's syllabus,
demanding to be let in. He has 45 hours of lecture time and 12
hours of classroom time to apportion among them. So far, he said,
no disease is definitely off the list, but Howie S. may soon be
heading for retirement.

THE MELDING OF MIND WITH MACHINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Calif.)   (af)  
 By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We humans have been trying to accelerate our own evolution for
millennia, and while in some ways we appear to be getting away with
it, biological computing could well test the forbearance of Mother
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the most ambitious efforts to outwit natural
selection have been cloning and the Human Genome Project, which
sets out to map the results of random mutation and natural
selection on our collective genetic inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists embark on these projects not out of mere curiosity
but with the hope of remaking ourselves into organisms more fit for
survival than our ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   But photocopying genes and building a repair manual for them are
only ways of tinkering with natural selection. Far more ambitious
are efforts to meld machines and living cells being undertaken now
in several areas of research. If these endeavors ever realize their
goals, the personal computer will become very personal indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the work of researchers at British Telecommunications
PLC in the area of implanted chips. One project, somewhat ominously
dubbed ``Soul Catcher,'' seeks to develop a computer that can be
implanted in the brain to complement human memory and computational
skills.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it would enable the gathering of extrasensory
information _ in this case, data transmitted by wireless
networking.
</P>
<P>
   This area of research may seem far-fetched, but it is really the
logical extension of devices like pacemakers, ocular implants,
which simulate hearing for the deaf, and neuro-stimulators, which
send small electrical charges through nerves to alleviate certain
kinds of pain.
</P>
<P>
   In a metaphorical sense, the morphing of man and machine is
already taking place. Among Silicon Valley digit-heads, the human
brain and its products are commonly alluded to as ``wetware,''
while intelligence is expressed in ``bandwidth'' _ as in, ``A lot
of valuable wetware was invested in that product, but we couldn't
sell it to a bunch of low-bandwidth vulture capitalists.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that electronics is making its way into the
human body, biological organisms are instructing chip design.
British Telecom is investing in Soul Catcher not only for the
long-term potential of brain-chip implants but on the assumption
that, conversely, the workings of the human central nervous system
can teach chip makers a thing or two about network efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   After all, while our information storage capacity and
computational skills are limited compared with those of computers,
the responses of even a 1-year-old child to stimuli like pain,
light or sound suggest that the nervous system is a far more robust
network that the fastest Ethernet.
</P>
<P>
   Biology is already invading computer architecture. Two
University of Rochester professors _ Dr. Animesh Ray, a biologist,
and Dr. Mitsunori Ogihara, a computer scientist _ collaborated two
years ago in building a rudimentary device that uses nucleotides to
perform functions typically handled by transistors in a silicon
processor.
</P>
<P>
   And across the continent, in Santa Clara, Calif., engineers at a
company called Affymetrix are making computer chips containing DNA
to diagnose genetic mutations.
</P>
<P>
   Will the merging of machine and organism bypass evolution or is
it merely an extension of the evolutionary process?
</P>
<P>
   Peter Cochrane, the head of research at British Telecom as well
as a celebrated futurist and a specialist in ``human-computer
interfaces,'' embraces the latter view. In fact, he says the future
of the human species depends on our continuing and expanding
ability to process information. If not, he wrote in a 1996 column
for The Daily Telegraph in Britain, ``systems more efficient at
information processing may supplant us.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the spread of the Internet suggests that people
are already on the threshold of a major evolutionary step as
information-processing organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Communication over the Internet breaks old time and space
bounds, allowing those who are connected to share, interactively,
an enormous and growing wealth of information. The technology
itself is quickly evolving into a sort of global nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine the full consequences of uninterrupted
access to that network through an implanted computer that renders
each of us a node in a global tapestry of information.
</P>
<P>
   Without safeguards, for example, the enhancement of our brains
could easily destroy our minds, leaving us unable to distinguish
reality from virtual reality _ maybe even self from non-self.
Powerful software would have to be developed to help us sort, sift
and prioritize the constant deluge of information lest our brains
degenerate into data landfills.
</P>
<P>
   Many people already feel overwhelmed by information. One more
billboard, radio jingle, dashboard gauge or spam e-mail and we
suspect we will fry like an overloaded circuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, perhaps the most frightening question in these
futuristic visions of the mind-machine meld is who or what can be
entrusted to run the system. Who among us would entrust our
innermost thoughts and the plumbing for all this incoming data to
an ``encephalized'' operating system?
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2028, anyone?

SAN ANTONIO TOUTS ETHNIC MIX TO GOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Civic boosters in San Antonio, a city famous for
the Alamo and the Riverwalk, think they have a new trump card in
their bid to host the next Republican National Convention: the
city's growing Hispanic population.
</P>
<P>
   ``If San Antonio is chosen, it's a clear extended hand by the
Republicans to the national Hispanic community,'' said Tom
Loeffler, a former Republican congressman who is spearheading the
city's campaign to host the GOP gathering in 2000. ``It's a very
important item that Republicans must consider.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alamo City seems all but certain to make the first cut when
Republicans narrow the list of potential sites from eight to as few
as three, possibly within the next few days. The other contenders
are New Orleans, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Indianapolis,
Minneapolis and Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Although party leaders say political considerations are far less
important than such mundane items as the number of hotel rooms, San
Antonio backers are convinced that they have the winning
combination of good facilities and the right population mix.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio's Hispanic population officially stands at about 56
percent, making it the nation's largest majority-Hispanic city.
</P>
<P>
   The city grew up around a string of Spanish missions constructed
in the early 1700s and has never abandoned its cultural ties. A
surplus of Mexican restaurants and attractions like El Mercado, a
Mexican-style market, and La Villita, an arts and crafts village on
the site of the original settlement, add to the city's reputation
as Mexico's northernmost city.
</P>
<P>
   With both political parties courting the Hispanic vote, San
Antonio boosters are marketing the home town as a vital link to the
nation's fastest-growing voting bloc. Hispanics make up about 11
percent of the U.S. population, but they are expected to comprise
25 percent by 2050, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is particularly evident in vote-rich Texas and
California, states that traditionally play a big role in
presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Opinsky, a Republican consultant who is assisting in
preparation of San Antonio's convention bid, said GOP leaders
cannot ignore political realities in selecting a host city.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can read the demographics as well as anybody. If we don't
start doing better in the Hispanic community, we're not going to
win the White House in the year 2010 because the votes won't be
there,'' he said. ``Being able to show the party wrapped around the
imagery of a Hispanic city and in the middle of the Hispanic
culture says a lot to the viewers at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic stakes are huge. The convention is expected to
generate more than $100 million in direct economic benefits. Nearly
2,000 Republican delegates will be accompanied by an equal number
of alternates, 15,000 journalists and about 20,000 lobbyists,
political groupies and assorted hangers-on.
</P>
<P>
   The indirect benefits of international attention are impossible
to measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are larger conventions and trade shows, but none of them
attract a press corps of 15,000 journalists,'' said Tim
Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for the Republican site selection
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has hosted two Republican National Conventions in recent
years _ Houston in 1992 and Dallas in 1984. Democrats haven't
gathered in the state for their national convention since visiting
Houston in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Cities bidding for the 2000 Democratic National Convention
include Los Angeles, Boston, Miami and Denver. New Orleans,
Philadelphia and Minneapolis are competing for both major-party
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties hope to make the final selection by year's end,
although the GOP pick will not be officially ratified until
January. In the meantime, members of the two site selection
committees are getting the red-carpet treatment from the potential
hosts.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio treated members of the Republican delegation to
dinner on the Alamo grounds and gave each visitor a personalized
Spurs basketball jersey. The city's $21.3 million convention
commitment _ $6.3 million in municipal services and $15 million in
cash and in-kind contributions from private donors _ includes the
promise of a car and driver for all 165 members of the Republican
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the site selectors received carriage rides in
Central Park, tickets and back-stage passes to a Broadway show, and
dinner at Tavern on the Green. Indianapolis passed out copies of
the movie ``Hoosiers'' autographed by Bobby Plump, the former high
school basketball player whose exploits inspired the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than a normal business trip where you're cooped up
in a hotel for a couple days,'' Fitzpatrick acknowledged. Although
the GOP spokesman carefully avoided any signs of favoritism, he
offered assurances that this summer's Texas heat wave will not
count against San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to find a city that can best physically accommodate
us, weather or no weather,'' Fitzpatrick said. ``It would be a
great chance for San Antonio to show us how well their air
conditioning works.''

MISSION POSSIBLE: HUNTING FOR INCA GOLD AT 18,000 FEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ My eyelids jolt open at 5 a.m. and I look
anxiously at the skylight above my hotel bed. For the first time in
days no rain splatters on it. Today we will fly over the Andes.
</P>
<P>
   The tension was thick last night among the expedition crew, a
high-testosterone group of scientists, fly-boys, documentary
filmmakers and treasure hunters. Weather and other technical
adversities had forced postponement of the flight for several days
and time was growing short.
</P>
<P>
   They had come to South America to test new, ultra-refined,
ground-penetrating radar, a device that could revolutionize
archaeology. For the scientists, the aim was to prove the
capabilities of the tool by flying over a region in the Andes
reputed to be the last bastion of Inca life. They hoped to find
evidence beneath the trees, or under the earth.
</P>
<P>
   For the treasure hunters on the periphery of this group, the
hope was cracking the mystery of where the Inca buried their gold.
Would the radar turn up indications of mines? Roads? Structures?
For the Berkeley, Calif.-based documentary crew headed by Adam
Ballachey and David Ultan, the goal was to film the final scenes of
``The Search for Inca Gold,'' an hour-long film they were making
about the project for the A&AMP;E Network series, ``The New
Explorers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballachey and Ultan, both 30 and friends since childhood, have
been pursuing this story for two years, interviewing prominent
treasure hunters, compiling historic leads, even trekking into the
Llanganati, the viciously rugged area of the Andes that history
claims is where Inca general Rumanahui hid some 40 tons of gold
from Spanish conquistadors in the mid-1500s.
</P>
<P>
   History books suggest it could be the largest cache of
undiscovered treasure in the world, worth up to $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Heading the science experiment is Dr. Roger Vickers, 60, who
possibly has the most at stake in how this test flight pans out. He
developed the radar technology.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Sky, has too many gnarly missions _ some say for the
CIA _ under his belt to be anything less than completely
trustworthy as he guides this twin-engine Beechcraft through
18,000-foot Andean peaks.
</P>
<P>
   On board is an array of computer screens, keyboards and other
high-tech gizmos. I cram myself into a corner seat and try not to
kick out any of the hundred electrical cords running through the
cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Taking off, the plane must quickly climb, such is the sharp bowl
of the valley. Soon we are traveling directly toward the volcano
Cotopaxi, a stunning sight in the bright sun. I anxiously wonder if
we are going to clear the summit, which crowds the entire
windshield. Then I realize we are going to fly by so close it feels
like I'll be able to scrape off the snow with my hands.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the clouds part and ahead of us lies a patch of jagged,
green peaks: the Llanganati.
</P>
<P>
   Looking down, I am amazed by the amount of water _ rivers and
waterfalls and streams _ all brown and rushing. It is not jungle,
exactly, but rugged high-altitude scrub and forest. The mountains
rise so sharply it's hard to imagine an army traversing them, but
the Inca people were a hardy lot.
</P>
<P>
   The team decides that the conditions are so perfect they will go
ahead and do the survey now, rather than coming back later. In a
trice, Vickers has set the equipment, and Sky gives him the
coordinates to start the radar.
</P>
<P>
   Diving down into the valley, the plane follows the slopes off to
the right side. After one low sweep of the area, Vickers asks Sky,
``Can you keep going a bit longer?'' The pilot quips that it would
be impossible, ``unless you want to eat some trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Straight ahead, there is a hillside looming, which we skim over
just higher than the treetops.
</P>
<P>
   After the second pass things become a bit less tense. Peering
down into the bottomless valley, Vickers quips, ``Damn, there's
that gold again!''
</P>
<P>
   Back on the ground, the drama is awaiting the survey results,
which will have to be compiled in the coming weeks. And Vickers and
Sky already have their next mission assigned _ this time by the
U.S. military _ which will most likely be filmed again by Ballachey
and Ultan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to fly over some abandoned military sites and use
the radar to look for unexploded munitions!'' Sky says brightly.

 REP. YOUNG TAKES A PAGE FROM SEN. McCARTHY  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, has created a new loyalty test for
members of the U.S. Forest Service:
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you now, or have you ever been, a card-carrying member of
The Sierra Club? Are you now, or have you ever been, a dues-paying
member of the Wilderness Society? Have you ever had any contact
with environmental organizations?''
</P>
<P>
   On July 28, Young, as the chairman of the House Resources
Committee, wrote a letter to the Regional Forester of the
Southwestern Region Eleanor S. Towns of the Forest Service in
Albuquerque, N.M., asking her ``whether any of their employees are
members of'' or ``have any contact with'' any environmental groups
that have been involved in lawsuits against the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   The letter asks 19 separate questions, each of which would take
a month to answer fully, but this one _ question No. 13 _ stands
out as an unconstitutional infringement on the associational rights
of federal employees. The U.S. Supreme Court made it clear in
rulings from the 1960s and '70s that even federal employees have a
right to associate with whom they wish.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear from the letter that Young doesn't like the way the
Endangered Species Act is being implemented in Southwestern United
States. The Forest Service had reached an agreement with ranchers
to preserve the limited riparian areas in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Towns was given until Aug. 15 to respond to Young's inquiry.
Let's call the enviro-affiliation question what it is _ a
witch-hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Young's letter implies that enviros in the Forest Service leak
federal documents to environmental groups. Question No. 12 of the
letter: ``How does the U.S. Forest Service prevent conflicts of
interest involving their employees from arising in their
decision-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the old Joe McCarthy ploy _ guilt by association. The taint
of environmentalism is equivalent to the stigma of communism in
Young's equation.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a Forest Service employee and a member of the
Southwest Center for Biological Diversity or any other
environmental group, you probably leaked Forest Service information
to give leverage to the environmentalists in lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The implication here is that if you are employed by the Forest
Service, then you had better not be a card-carrying member of any
environmental group. You shouldn't care about the environment.
After all, forests are timber waiting to be cut _ nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   The very question reflects Young's own position on the
environment _ the wilderness and forests are there to be exploited.
In the last few years he has voted against a bill to repeal the
lawless salvage timber sale program; against a bill to reform of
the hardrock mining; against a bill to eliminate funding for
subsidized timber logging roads.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Public Interest Research Group gave him a zero rating
on environmental issues in 1995-96. PIRGs are state-based
non-profit, non-partisan research and advocacy groups. In 1997, the
League of Conservation Voters, which educates voters on the voting
records of their elected officials, gave Young a mere 6 percent
rating out of a possible 100 percent on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of Congress, Young is one of the best arguments in
favor of term limits _ currently serving his 13th term as Alaska's
only member of the House, he is tied into the economic power
structure. Bound, one might say.
</P>
<P>
   According to the non-profit, non-partisan Center for Responsive
Politics, in a short year and a half, from January 1997 to July
1998, Young has accepted $93,736 in campaign contributions from the
oil and gas, forestry, and mining industries.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Young doesn't see that accepting these funds might
constitute a conflict of interest for the chairman of the House
Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the two-year election cycle, 1995-1996, Young pocketed a
little more than $1.1 million in campaign donations _ $173,050 or
15 percent of that came from agricultural, energy and natural
resource industries.
</P>
<P>
   Young is well aware where his loyalties lie.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of disclosure _ which Young has asked from Forest
Service employees _ I suggest that before any member of Congress
votes on a bill, he or she state how much in total campaign
contributions have been received from industries affected by the
proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how different the votes on proposed legislation would be
if a member of Congress had to get up and confess: ``Hello, my name
is Don Young. I'm addicted to campaign donations from the minerals
and agricultural industries. In the past year, I accepted over
$100,000 in contributions from them. And now I vote in favor of
this bill that grants a tax break to these industries.''
</P>
<P>
   While campaign contributions may not constitute a quid pro quo,
a favor for a favor, a vote for a large donation _ still the vast
amounts of money do weigh heavily and create a steep inclined
plane, a slope that funnels the vote in the desired direction. An
upright member of Congress might have a problem not falling down
into it.
</P>
<P>
   At least our senators and representatives ought to be called on
the relationship between their votes and the donations they have
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Young might then be a little more cautious about accusing others
of conflicts of interest and so-called tainted associations.

THEY CALL IT STORMY SATURDAY?  
 BACTERIA FEAST ON TNT  
 ADULTS KEY TO SAVING SPECIES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   You work hard during that Monday-through-Friday grind, and what
do you get for your efforts?
</P>
<P>
   Rainy weekends, perhaps. Two researchers at Arizona State
University, Randall S. Cerveny and Robert C. Balling Jr., have
shown that there may be a correlation between work-week pollution
and increased precipitation on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long known that some pollution varies in weekly
cycles corresponding to human activity. The phenomenon even has a
nickname: the Sunday effect. It is thought to be related to heavier
use of cars during the work week.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the current study, Cerveny said, is ``if we show
weather that has a seven-day cycle, the likelihood is that it is
created by something that we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists analyzed climate data for a zone of the western
Atlantic, out to 400 miles from the East Coast. They found that
rainfall in the area was higher on Fridays and Saturdays than the
rest of the week. By Sunday the average rainfall had begun to
decline. Their results are reported in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers theorize that airborne pollutants, built up
during the week along the urbanized East Coast and swept in by the
prevailing winds, are to blame for the wet weather. Solid pollution
particles trap heat and in turn heat the surrounding air. This
creates greater uplift of air, and results in more clouds and
rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   So if your bosses want you to work a weekend, tell them yes,
provided you can take Monday off. And enjoy the weather. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria, of course, work seven days a week, 365 days a year.
But that doesn't mean they cannot occasionally have a blast.
</P>
<P>
   A strain of Enterobacter cloacae bacteria has been demonstrated
by researchers in Britain to have an appetite for trinitrotoluene,
better known as the explosive TNT.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria produce an enzyme that can break down the ring
structure of TNT, which is resistant to degradation. The scientists
say the organism holds promise for helping to decontaminate weapons
manufacturing and testing sites that are rife with the explosive.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a strain of cold-adapted bacteria has been shown to
be effective in breaking down hydrocarbons in low temperatures. The
Canadian researchers who studied the bacteria, a strain of
rhodococcus, suggest that it could be used to help clean spills of
diesel fuel or kerosene in the Arctic. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is natural to think that whether a species thrives depends on
the survival of its young. But researchers have shown that in the
case of the cheetah, at least, deaths of adult animals have a
greater impact on population than deaths of cubs do.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, at the University of California at Santa Cruz,
used a computer model of a cheetah population based on field
studies of the animal in the Serengeti plains in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The model, which could be adjusted for different mortality rates
and other parameters, showed that survival of adult animals is the
force that drives population growth. This despite the fact that in
some areas of Africa and Asia, up to 95 percent of cheetah cubs do
not survive to adulthood, most falling victim to lions, hyenas and
other animals.
</P>
<P>
   The reason involves cheetah reproduction. Field studies have
shown that when a female cheetah's cubs die, she quickly enters a
period of sexual readiness, or heat, and breeds again.
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, the loss of an adult can be traumatic for
the reproductive abilities of a population. (The ability to breed
again rapidly seems to be an evolved trait, suggesting that
cheetahs have been losing their young for a long time.)
</P>
<P>
   The researchers say their work holds lessons for wildlife
conservationists who are struggling to protect cheetahs. It may be
more important to save adult animals from human predators like
poachers than to save cubs from animal predators like lions.

<P>
   When you pet a cat, the cat purrs.
</P>
<P>
   When you pet an octopus, the octopus pets you back.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe it doesn't quite pet. It loops a limb around your
hand, and it explores you. And at first you jump, and then you
laugh, and then you practically yodel with joy, for the sensation
of an octopus fondle is unlike anything you have sensated before.
Its flesh is slippery and silky, like the inside of your cheek, or
a spoonful of flan. And arrayed in pairs along the underside of its
eight arms are its extraordinary suckers, the animal's way of
knowing the world.
</P>
<P>
   An octopus has 1,200 or more muscular suckers, and each one can
move as an independent operator, sucking and plucking and nuzzling
at an object like a tiny infant mouth rooting at his mother's
breast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch out for your rings!'' Carrie Reidel warned. ``He can
pull them right off your fingers.'' Ms. Reidel is a keeper at the
Invertebrate House of the National Zoo in Washington, home to the
giant octopus now engaged in an act of hominid-cephalopod groping.
She hovers over the tank, a long pole at the ready. Sometimes the
octopus suctions hard enough to leave behind a mark. ``We call that
an octopus hickey,'' Ms. Reidel said.
</P>
<P>
   But no hickeys today, alas. Today the octopus, a 2-year-old,
30-pound male of the species Octopus dofleini, is in a gentle,
languid mood, and he soon releases his mesmerized guest. As he
swims off, his limbs snake around him like the scarves of Chinese
dancers, the membranes between them billowing into a translucent
orange parachute.
</P>
<P>
   An octopus is an invertebrate, a mollusk, no less, and thus in
the same taxonomic category as clams, oysters and snails. Yet the
octopus stands head and multiple shoulders above other
invertebrates in its capacity to elicit human affection and
fascination.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the National Zoo express their admiration with
hoots, sighs and aahs, and a comparative disdain for other
creatures in the vicinity, even the tarantulas. Keepers at
aquariums and zoos say they will name their octopuses, a thought
that never crosses their mind for the anemones or the fish _ and
did the Beatles ever write a song about a trout? The ancients
revered octopuses: the Minoans painted them on vases 3,500 years
ago, while the early Hindus may have used them as inspiration for
depictions of such poly-limbed gods as Siva and Vishnu.
</P>
<P>
   Most smitten of all are octopus biologists, who never tire of
their subject, never question their career choice and never
hesitate to draw attention to the beauty and sophistication of the
octopus. Some will talk about how clever the octopus is, ``the most
intelligent invertebrate in the world, there's no denying it,''
said Roland Anderson, a biologist at the Seattle Aquarium. How
smart is smart? Smart enough to want to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Jennifer Mather, an associate professor of psychology
and neuroscience at the University of Lethbridge in Canada,
reported at the Animal Behavior Society annual meeting that
octopuses engage in play behavior, a mark of relative mental
complexity and normally considered the province of young mammals.
But Dr. Mather described her observations of an octopus in an
aquarium that deliberately took a bottle over to the current of
water in its tank, watched it float along the current, and then
brought it back to do the same thing again, and again. ``If that
isn't play behavior,'' she said, ``I don't know what is.''
</P>
<P>
   The octopus also has real personality. Dr. Mather and Anderson
recently described their laboratory studies suggesting that
octopuses come in at least three different temperamental humors:
passive, aggressive and paranoid. Working with the red octopus, a
small species found off Seattle in Puget Sound, the researchers
repeatedly tested 44 individuals under 19 defined circumstances _
for example, how each octopus reacted when somebody opened its tank
and looked in, how it responded to a ``threat'' in the form of a
touch with a bristly brush, and how readily it pounced on proffered
prey like a crab.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the octopuses attacked the brush, and grabbed the crab
immediately upon seeing it. Those subjects the researchers labeled
aggressive. Others cringed from the brush and would wait until they
were alone, after nightfall, to eat their crabs _ the passive ones.
Still others, the paranoids, would respond to a threat by letting
out a burst of ink and jetting away. Each animal was consistent in
its behaviors from one round of testing to the next. ``We feel
strongly that octopuses have personalities,'' Anderson concluded.

</P>
<P>
   Octopus biologists love octopuses even though they are
notoriously hard to study in the wild, and even though there is
little financial support for their passion. None of the 100 or so
described species of octopus is thought to be in danger of
extinction, and so the field lacks the cachet of eco-consciousness.
Nevertheless, biologists love octopuses living and they love them
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Voight of the Field Museum in Chicago has a lab full of
pickled octopuses in jars, specimens dredged up from oceanic depths
of two miles or more by submersible vehicles. She dissects each
rubbery, distorted corpse delivered to her, seeking to determine if
it is a familiar species or an entirely new one.
</P>
<P>
   She and others suspect that there are at least as many octopus
species out there to be discovered as are already described. Dr.
Voight also watches hour upon hour of videotape taken by cameras
aboard the submersible vehicle Alvin, of ghostly octopuses creeping
along the moonscape floor of the sea, or near the thermal vents.
She is trying to understand how the biology and behavior of
deep-water octopuses differ from what is seen in their cousins
closer to shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that, look at that!'' she said, pointing excitedly to
the video screen. ``It's doing a breast stroke! I don't know if
I've ever seen another octopus do that.'' She turns sheepish. ``I'm
like a parent with videos of my babies, aren't I?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while Dr. Voight will never see many of her babies alive,
still she loves octopuses. ``There's something magical about
them,'' she said. ``They remind us of ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   They have big, human-like eyes that gaze out at you, she said,
with pupils that can dilate and contract. Their mantle, the large
sac that bulges up from the arms, resembles a giant, brainy head,
although the mantle in fact is where an octopus' visceral organs
are stored, while the real head is a small thatch right around the
eyes. ``And they're such bloodthirsty killers,'' Dr. Voight said.
``I like predators. I'm not going to study some sort of boring,
grazing thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Octopuses are not boring, but they are common. They abound
throughout the earth's oceans, from shallow waters to deep. The
smallest known octopus is Octopus micropyrsus, found off the shores
of California, which reaches barely an inch in length, while the
largest is the giant Octopus dofleini of the North Pacific, which
can grow to 15 feet long and weigh more than 100 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The octopus has a catholic diet rather than a kosher one. It
loves just about any type of shellfish _ shrimp, lobster, clams,
gastropods, crabs. ``An octopus is like a vacuum cleaner as it
moves along the reef,'' said John Forsythe, a marine biologist at
the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. ``All eight
arms are working at once, investigating every crack and crevice
with its suction cups, and pulling things out from deep inside.''
Upon yanking forth a crab or bivalve, the octopus balloons its
entire body around the prey and brings it up toward its beak-like
mouth, located at the center of its arms. The octopus then injects
a paralyzing neurotoxin into the prey, followed by an enzyme to
dissolve the meat away from the shell. With its mouth, radiating
arms and all those suckers, Forsythe said, ``what an octopus
amounts to is the most extraordinary set of lips on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   But they are not loose lips. An octopus makes good on
practically everything it eats. Humans convert maybe 10 percent of
ingested food into usable energy. An octopus' conversion rate is
greater than 50 percent, allowing it to bulk up from a birth size
so tiny it floats on plankton to its adult size in a matter of
weeks or months. And nearly all of what it puts on is pure muscle.
``An octopus in a lab can lift cinder blocks to get out of its
tank,'' Forsythe said. ``It's like having Arnold Schwarzenegger's
biceps in your aquarium.''
</P>
<P>
   The octopus' musculature stands in for a skeleton, and gives it
structure. That structure is flexible, and can nearly vanish when
an octopus chooses, allowing a very large animal to squeeze into a
space the size of, say, an empty beer bottle. Octopuses like to
hide in a den _ any crevice or hole that is protected. Often they
conceal the opening to that den by piling up rocks, broken shells,
broken glass, bottle caps, lost wedding rings, anything they can
find or sucker. That pile is called an octopus midden _ or garden,
if you prefer.
</P>
<P>
   The octopus' history is a tale of triumph and sorrow. Octopuses
are descendants of shelled mollusks that date back 500 million
years, but with the rise of the bony fishes, the octopus and its
cephalopod kin, the squid and the cuttlefish, had to take drastic
measures if they were to compete with the swift-swimming
vertebrates. They had to get fast and mobile in a hurry, which
meant losing the shell, their protective armor. They did get fast,
for an octopus can burst away by taking water into its mantle and
squirting it out through its siphon. But without a shell, it became
terribly vulnerable to other carnivores. ``An octopus is a good
hunk of protein,'' Forsythe said. ``You're talking sushi here.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the octopus evolved a new method of defense, a capacity
to camouflage itself that may be the finest in the animal kingdom.
It can change from orange to green to bone to blue in a fraction of
a second. While most animals that can change color, the chameleon,
for example, rely on blood-borne signals that take a few seconds to
reach the skin, the octopus manages the switch with its nervous
system.
</P>
<P>
   In its skin are cells called chromatophores, and each has little
sacs of red, black and yellow pigments. With a simple twitch of a
nerve impulse, the chromatophores release the appropriate mixture
of those pigments to blend in with the octopus' background. To
further widen the palette of disguises, the skin is stippled with
crystalline cells that reflect external light. Moreover, dermal
muscles can instantly pucker up the skin to make it resemble sand
or coral reef, or flatten it out to make it resemble smooth stones.
</P>
<P>
   Australian scientists have recently discovered a spectacular
group of octopuses, called mimic octopuses, which can change shape
to impersonate other marine animals. The mimics can take on the
appearance of a flounder, shrimp, sea snake, stingray, brittle star
or giant crab, a repertory that suggests the animals use their
camouflage not just for defensive purposes but also, in the spirit
of a wolf in sheep's clothing, to help them hunt better.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure of competition from vertebrates may also explain
why the octopus is comparatively supple in its behavior and can
learn at least a few things from experience.
</P>
<P>
   However they defend or offend, octopuses and other cephalopods
have flourished, and now account for a large fraction of the
ocean's biomass. Yet in living fast, they also die young. Octopuses
survive no more than two or three years, and they have but one
episode of reproduction. Their mating is frenzied and violent, a
writhing bowl of spaghetti, as the male and female arm-wrestle,
thrust at each other with their hard beaks and flash their colors
as if they were traffic lights and warning signs. The male has one
specially designed tentacle that is shorter than the other seven,
and unsuckered at its tip, and he uses that limb as a penis
equivalent, to pull his sperm from his mantle and thrust it into
the female's oviduct. Shortly after the mating ritual, the male
rapidly declines. He loses the sharpness of his camouflage. His
eyes cloud over, he stops eating, and he dies of starvation.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, the female still has a job to do. She is a good
mother, as invertebrates go. Several weeks after copulation, she
releases tens of thousands of eggs on a long, sticky strand and
attaches them to a protective surface. She stays with the eggs
until they hatch, all the while grooming them obsessively. But once
her young are born, neither her arms nor suckers nor personal charm
can keep her hanging on, and she dies.

NEW WAYS TO RESTORE A PATIENT'S GIFT OF GAB

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jean M. Morris is a woman with an easy laugh and a gift of gab.
She was also a lifelong smoker until she was diagnosed with
emphysema. A little over a year ago, in April 1997, in an operation
to reduce some of her diseased lung tissue, her left lung
collapsed. The procedure to repair it left her permanently unable
to speak above a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's frustrating because I have some things to say,'' said
Ms. Morris, a 67-year-old registered nurse from Dover, Del.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have long been trying to give people their voices back.
In the 19th century, Victorian physicians attempted to do it with
electrical stimulation to the affected throat. In the 20th century,
ear and throat specialists, otolaryngologists, have treated the
voiceless with a variety of what they call larynoplastic phono
surgeries _ operations to make vocal cords work again.
</P>
<P>
   For the future, Dr. Steven M. Zeitels, a surgeon at the
Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston, sees a return to
electricity in the form of tiny pacemakers helping the vocal cords
to open and close normally.
</P>
<P>
   He is now performing pioneering operations to restore the voice
without implants by manipulating the cartilage in the throat. But
implants are still widely used and some researchers are expanding
the ways they are used.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are two doctors of otolaryngology at the Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Charles W.
Cummings and Paul W. Flint. They refined a procedure with new
instruments and implants that enabled Ms. Morris to be heard and to
be herself again.
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, Flint put a newly available implant, made of a
calcium-based synthetic bone material, in Ms. Morris' throat. The
implant, called a Vocom, or vocal cord medialization, holds the
cord closed when not in use and adds bulk to weak cords, improving
both a patient's voice and swallowing function.
</P>
<P>
   When vocal cords are severed or impaired, their natural position
is open, and that means they are unable to trap air, which in turn
creates difficultly in breathing, exercising and eating. When a
person swallows, the vocal cord closes and protects the airway, but
when it is open permanently, a person is at risk of choking _ even
on his or her own saliva.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, doctors began to repair such damage by injecting Teflon
paste into the vocal cord to bulk it up and close it. But, Cummings
said, that was an imprecise method, irreversible, unadjustable and
unstable. It also could be rejected by the body and lead to
inflammation or infection.
</P>
<P>
   Next came a solid form of silicone in a rubberized cube. With
this procedure, still widely used, the surgeons whittle the cube to
fit the waiting patient. But, Cummings said, ``There was a need to
have a better solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Cummings, who is the chairman of otolaryngology surgery at Johns
Hopkins Hospital, and Flint have devised a set of instruments and
implants in five different sizes, allowing for a faster, more
predictable operation, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The device is put into the throat through an incision off the
center of the neck below the Adam's Apple while the patient is
awake. The doctor inserts different sizes until the patient is
satisfied with her voice. Ms. Morris said she told Flint ``to keep
going until I sound like Celine Dion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christy Ludlow, a speech and language pathologist at the
National Institutes of Health said the devices are for patients who
do not recover spontaneously from nerve damage. ``They can restore
very good voice function,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone was previously a singer, they won't return to being
a singer,'' she said, ``but they will have a voice adequate for
communication.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States Food and Drug Administration approved the
manufacture and marketing of the Vocom throat implant late in 1997,
but during the year Cummings and Flint said they performed as many
as 100 procedures with their implants as part of a clinical trial
that involved two other hospitals, Columbia Presbyterian in
Manhattan and the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The implants have also been available in Europe since 1994, said
Brad Beale of Smith &AMP; Nephew, the Memphis company that makes the
five sizes of implants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to know the ultimate potential for it, but
12,000 to 15,000 patients are having a procedure like it yearly,''
Beale said. He would not say how many had been sold, but said, ``I
can say it has been very successful in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The sized implants, however, have not won universal acceptance
in the field. Dr. Clark A. Rosen, a spokesman for the American
Academy of Otolaryngology and director of the University of
Pittsburgh Voice Center, said, ``The real question is: Is
everyone's larynx and everyone's vocal cord problem fixable with
five easy implants?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The human body,'' he added, ``is more complicated than that.
It's three dimensional.'' Rosen uses the cube, which he whittles to
fit each patient. ``When I carve my implants, I can customize in
three dimensions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the more important factor, regardless of the implant used,
Rosen said, is having an experienced specialist perform the
procedure. ``That's how you're going to get the best results,''
Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Morris, she is speaking well and pleased with the
results. ``I have a lot of things to do yet,'' she said, ``and I
need to talk to do them.''

SEINFELD CONTINUES TO REVEL IN THE ODDNESS OF THE ORDINARY 
</HEADLINE>

 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
JERRY SEINFELD 
I'm telling you for the last time: Live on Broadway 
On HBO last night 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Some people never can say goodbye. But not Jerry Seinfeld. In
the spring, the comedian bid a much publicized adieu to his hugely
successful sitcom after nine years. And Sunday night, live from New
York on HBO, he said farewell again, this time to the stand-up
material he has cultivated so far in his career.
</P>
<P>
   While the special was titled ``I'm Telling You for the Last
Time'' most of Seinfeld's fans were probably hearing these jokes
for the first time. Excluding the brief stand-up snippets that
bookmarked ``Seinfeld'' in its early years, we've mostly
encountered his distinctive view of life in the form of situational
gags split among at least three other jokers. Sunday night, wearing
a suit and tie, Seinfeld appeared confident and eager as he stood
alone on a stage with a stool and a glass of water, delivering his
charmingly trivial observations to an adoring house. At one point,
a woman yelled out that she loved Seinfeld, triggering his ad lib
``I love you too, but I do feel the need to'' _ he gestured at the
rest of the audience _ ``see other people.'' Miraculously, he
managed not to be diminished by the hype that surrounded the HBO
special, his first prime-time appearance since May and the final
performance of a world tour that has been heavily promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld's hour revolved mostly around his amazement at the
strangeness of ordinary things. Always obsessed with hygiene, he
spent some time wondering about New York cab drivers and their body
odor. ``How long are these shifts?'' he exclaimed. He thought out
loud on the subject of pharmacists, who always seem to dispense
their drugs from platforms, and he dwelled on the very specific
expiration dates milk companies put on their cartons: ``Maybe the
cows tip them off when they're millking them.''
</P>
<P>
   One surprise was the physicality of his performance. It was
Michael Richards as Kramer &UR;  &LR; who provided most of the visual humor
on ``Seinfeld,'' but Sunday night Seinfeld repeatedly used his body
and facial expressions to tell his stories. He mimicked the way
flight attendants instruct plane passengers on how to put on a seat
belt and how they point vaguely to the emergency exits. He did an
impression of a wolf man shaving. And in a riff about a forthcoming
visit to Florida, he pretended to be an elderly person backing out
of a driveway without looking.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Seinfeld,'' his humor seemed strikingly original and even
edgy. In a stand-up context, it had a more conventional, ``Tonight
Show'' feel to it. There was no envelope pushing, no Robin
Williams/Jim Carrey-styled craziness; just an energetic man and his
unusual sensibility. But it was a mostly amusing hour that, like
the sitcom, ended just before the laughs began to thin out. The
show left no indication of where Seinfeld hopes to take his comedy,
now that he's told these jokes for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   The stand-up routine was preceded by a very short, star-filled
film set in a graveyard. As a group of very familiar faces of
comedy stood watching in mock grief, including Garry Shandling,
George Carlin, Ed McMahon, Paul Reiser, Alan King, and Jay Leno,
Seinfeld buried a coffin filled with pages of his jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope it's his final act of finality, for this year at
least.

NEW CLUES TO RATES OF FRATERNAL TWINNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is well known that twin births occur when a single fertilized
egg splits very early in embryonic life, producing identical twins,
or when separate eggs are fertilized, producing nonidentical, or
fraternal, twins. But much remains unknown about why an embryo
might split or why a woman might release more than one egg when she
ovulates.
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists in Finland have some clues about fraternal twins.
</P>
<P>
   Rates of fraternal twinning vary from population to population,
and the tendency to produce fraternal twins is genetically
transmitted through the mother's line. Because the rate of
identical twinning is nearly identical worldwide, differences in
twinning rates, overall, are determined almost entirely by varying
rates of fraternal twin births.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, at the University of Turku, became intrigued by
the highest twinning rates for Caucasians anywhere, on the
archipelago of Aland and Aboland in southwestern Finland. On the
adjacent mainland, twins were far less common.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers analyzed the birth records from pre-industrial
times of 81 mothers of twins from the archipelago and 86 mothers of
twins from the mainland, pairing each mother of twins with a
comparison mother who had a single birth. They found that on the
archipelago, where the twinning rate was 21.3 percent, the number
of children successfully raised to adulthood was enhanced when a
woman bore twins. But on the mainland, where the twinning rate was
14.9 percent, women had greater reproductive success when they gave
birth to single babies.
</P>
<P>
   In their report in the current issue of Nature, the researchers
concluded that on the archipelago, where crop failures were rare
and fish readily available, the plentiful and constant food supply
gave twinning a selective reproductive advantage. But on the
mainland, where crop failures and famines were common, having to
nurse two babies at once would have been disadvantageous. Twins and
women who bore them would be less likely to survive than singletons
and thus less likely to pass on a tendency to produce fraternal
twins.
</P>
<P>
   According to the researchers, the finding is consistent with
expectations derived from life-history theory, which in effect say
that populations should make hay while the sun shines. When
resources are plentiful and predictable, living creatures should
reproduce while they can and while their offspring have the best
opportunity for survival.
</P>
<P>
   This explanation of difference in twinning rates may account in
part for the fact that while nearly all twins born even today to
mothers in Africa or Asia are identical twins, the majority of
twins born in Westernized countries, where the food supply is more
certain, are fraternal.
</P>
<P>
   But what would cause identical twinning?
</P>
<P>
   The late Dr. Alan Guttmacher, an obstetrician and an expert on
population growth, analyzed twinning rates worldwide and concluded
that a tendency to produce identical twins was not inherited. He
found that there was no increased tendency to bear identical twins
among women who had such twins in their family line. He theorized
that identical twinning was more like a birth defect, the result of
a noxious influence that causes the embryo to divide.
</P>
<P>
   But this defect was probably not something Guttmacher thought
was necessarily harmful. He himself was an identical twin.

   ON THE ROAD &QL; 
The Kuralt Approach &QL; 
 &UR; www.hiddenamerica.com &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to gather information about, say, Disney, on the Web.
You don't even have to look up the address; it is of course
www.disney.com, and it is stuffed with information about cruises,
shopping, videos and everything else to which an image of a smart
mouse or a dumb dog can be attached. But finding less obvious
things to do and places to go, local events little known outside
their immediate areas, is not as easy, and that is a need that
Hidden America intends to fill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Hidden America site on the Web, started a few months ago by
Eric Model of OTR (On the Road) Travel Information Services of
River Edge, N.J., focuses on annual festivals and events around the
country, especially ones you might drive to when you have a few
days off. Model also plans to have guides to ``village shops,''
where you can buy regional books, crafts and indigenous foods. Like
many Web sites, Hidden America is a work in progress; so far the
only shop listed on what will be an old-fashioned Main Street in
cyberspace was a bookstore, the ubiquitous Amazon.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Hidden America map looks like this: Road Compass, highlights
of coming events; Weekends on the Road, nearby activities;
Eventsamerica Annual Events; Newsletter from the Road Online, with
departments on such matters as roadside food, books and music, and
local language oddities; Backroads Forum, for exchanging
information; Village Shops; In My Hometown, and the American Travel
Experience, where a travel package, including air fare, auto
rentals and accommodations, eventually can be put together.
Accommodations will be largely bed-and-breakfasts, inns and small
hotels. If it all works out. Books and magazine and newspaper
articles are finished when they are printed; Web sites often are
not. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When I sampled Weekends on the Road in the days when July was
turning into August, I found a long list of events in the
Northeast, many of which had already taken place. A sample: ``Great
Falls Balloon Festival, August 21-23, Lewiston-Auburn, Maine. Hot
air balloons fill the downeast skies. Info: (207) 783-2249.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A handful of featured August events _ Elvis Week in Memphis, the
Delicato Charity Grape Stomp (California), Ketchum Wagon Days
(Idaho) and the Iowa State Fair _ were links to their respective
Web pages. From one I learned that the Delicato Vineyards, started
in Manteca, Calif., in 1924, will offer a tour on Aug. 30 while
grapes are being crushed. ``If you are 21 or older,'' the Delicatos
say, ``you will be able to taste the wine at three different
stages: juice, half wine/half juice, and wine.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the Charles Kuralt experience,'' Model said, referring
to the television personality's ``On the Road'' digressions. I
certainly will tune in again.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ON-LINE PLANNING &QL; 
Age Discounts &QL; 
 &UR; www.aarp.org  &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Less adventurous baby boomers, and older folks, should drop into
the Web site of the American Association of Retired Persons. One
section, Trips n' Travel (click on What's New), lists hotels,
cruise lines and such that offer discounts to AARP members. A dip
into the hotel section brought up a long directory of mostly
familiar names _ Days Inn, Ramada, Marriott and the like _ with
discounts of 10 percent or more off the regular rates. Experienced
travelers know that the first rate mentioned is seldom the last
word, and the site points out that occasionally hotels offer rates
that beat the AARP discount. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is reading matter that may inspire a trip. In early
August, an eight-day road trip through Tennessee, ``from Davy
Crockett to Dolly Parton,'' was the featured article, and there
were also separate pieces on Iceland and northern Wisconsin.

   &QL; 
KEYSTROKES FOR BACKSTROKES  &QL; 
Swimming Across the World &QL; 
 &UR; lornet.com/SGOL/ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year for swimming around here, but every
time of the year is the time for swimming somewhere. SGOL stands
for Swimmers Guide On Line, a data base of ``full-size,
year-round'' pools _ 4,937 in 55 countries _ and if you can't find
a place to swim from this Web site, you are just not trying. The
listings include name, address, telephone number, a description of
the pool, length and whether it is indoors or outdoors, admission
information and often the water temperature and number of lanes.
The founders of Swimmers Guide, Bill Haverland and Tom Saunders,
began it as a book, now out of print after two editions. After they
gave up on the idea of making a living from the book, they took
jobs as accountants in Raleigh, N.C., but maintained the
information as a free Web site, depending on users to provide
updated information. This is the 16th update in just over two
years.

 SAVING A SPECIAL ISLAND FOR LEMURS AND MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patricia Wright's trail to Madagascar and environmental heroism
began with an act that is now considered the antithesis of
conservation: the purchase in a Brooklyn pet store of an owl
monkey, and then a second one to keep it company. Within a week of
the birth of her own daughter, Amanda, the monkeys too produced a
Brooklyn baby, and the mother/housewife became increasingly
intrigued by the behavior of these nocturnal monkeys. The female
monkey's only responsibility appeared to be breast-feeding. The
male did all the parenting, carrying and caring for the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Wright, who had loved the woods growing up in upstate New
York and had a college degree in biology, decided she wanted to
study these monkeys in the wild. Books in the New York Public
Library told her that the ``wild'' meant the jungles of Peru, home
to wild boar, jaguars and deadly fer-de-lance snakes. She consulted
Warren Kinzey, then an anthropologist at City University of New
York, pumping him for guidance on how to do field research.
</P>
<P>
   Kinzey told her, in effect, that unless she earned a graduate
degree and acquired a university affiliation, no one would give her
the money she would need. But she was undeterred. Through a friend
who knew a dean at the New School for Social Research, she wangled
an affiliation with the school and persuaded Nancy Mulligan, a
wealthy widow interested in wildlife who lived in Rochester, N.Y.,
near Ms. Wright's hometown of Avon, to underwrite the expedition
for herself, her husband, their 3-year-old daughter and a native
guide.
</P>
<P>
   Her library research had led her to a site that turned out to
have long since been converted from jungle to coffee plantations.
No monkey had been seen there for 25 years. The next stop was a
six-day canoe ride into the jungle, family in tow. Her guide soon
got bored looking for monkeys in the dark, so one night Pat Wright
ventured alone into the jungle. Frightened by what sounded like
wild boar and with her flashlight growing dim, she spent the night
in a spiny tree, only to be scolded by none other than two owl
monkeys whose territory she had invaded.
</P>
<P>
   They were the first of many for Pat Wright. Six months later,
she returned to Brooklyn with notebooks filled with observations of
the monkeys, the first data ever gathered on nocturnal monkeys in
the wild. Kinzey was more than a little impressed.
</P>
<P>
   At his urging, she enrolled in graduate school at the City
University in 1977. Nine years later, including time out for child
care, a divorce and another 14-month trip to the Amazon, she
received her degree.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was off to Madagascar, known for its rare species and
especially lemurs. Armed with a grant from the World Wildlife Fund,
Ms. Wright hoped to find the ``probably extinct'' greater bamboo
lemur. Madagascar, a poor island country east of Kenya, had
physically split from the African mainland about 150 million years
ago, subsequently becoming a Darwinian laboratory of isolated
evolution. The ever-shrinking Malagasy jungles harbor thousands of
species of plants and animals known nowhere else on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of Madagascar's wildlife is unique to the island,
including nearly all of its mammals, 90 percent of its reptiles and
amphibians, 80 percent of its plants and half of its birds. The
rosy periwinkle that is the source of the life-saving leukemia drug
vincristine is one of 8,000 plants that are native to Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
   But all of this bounty was imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flying over the island,'' she recalled, ``all I saw was
devastation,'' the result of decades of slash-and-burn farming.
</P>
<P>
   En route to establishing that the greater bamboo lemur, a little
primate with big, watchful eyes and charcoal-grey fur, was indeed
alive and doing better than expected in the remaining Malagasy rain
forest, Ms. Wright discovered an entirely new species of lemur with
golden red fur, the golden bamboo lemur, which thrives on the
cyanide-laced shoots of young bamboo, though how this
three-and-a-half-pound primate tolerates an amount of poison that
could kill a man is still anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no sooner had I found this new species than I heard
farmers sawing down 200-year-old rosewood trees, each of which
takes about nine smaller trees with it,'' Ms. Wright recalled
recently. An appeal to the Ministry of Water and Forest to protect
the forest ended with a challenge to Ms. Wright to help establish a
national park.
</P>
<P>
   She explained that the repeated inroads into the Malagasy rain
forests were nothing more than Band-Aids for the farmers living in
one of the ten poorest countries in the world. After only two years
of farming on newly cleared land, the soil would be depleted,
forcing them to cut down yet more forest. Meanwhile, the runoff of
ochre-tinted soil ruined waterways and the loss of trees threatened
the watershed. And since few Malagasy were aware of the economic
potential of ecotourism, the farmers gave little thought to the
fast-disappearing habitats of Madagascar's unique flora and fauna,
which include 32 species of lemurs (16 of the largest ones have
already become extinct).
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ms. Wright arrived there in 1985, more than 80
percent of the forests had disappeared from this Indian Ocean
island and there were only two national parks in Madagascar, the
last one established in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   It took her five years to create the new park, five years of
days-long treks to visit with surrounding farmers and explain the
purpose of the park and its potential value to their families and
future, five years of negotiations with village elders and
government officials, five years of international phone calls and
grant proposals to raise the millions of dollars needed, not just
to create the park but to give the villagers something in return
for the land they would sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, with the help of $6.27 million from the U.S. Agency
for International Development and the support of various
conservation groups, there was not only a 108,000-acre park but
eight new schools, 10 renovated schools, four health-care
facilities, a team of visiting doctors and nurses, rural libraries
with books on conservation and 133 villagers working in the park.
In addition, the villagers receive half the entrance fees to the
park, now visited by 10,000 tourists a year.

</P>
<P>
   ``Pat's extraordinary contribution has been her ability to see
the intimate link between the beauty and fascination of the animals
and the lives of the people,'' said Alison Jolly, a primatologist
at Princeton University who studies ring-tailed lemurs in
Madagascar. ``It's so easy to say that what matters is the animals
or what matters is the people. Pat has been able to say that what
matters is both and, through her enthusiasm, devotion, energy and
courage, to make both happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Among her many prized honors is the Knight of the National Order
of Madagascar, a national medal of honor bestowed in 1995 by the
president of a country that now knows the rewards of saving its
once-raped rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wright serves as executive director of the Institute for the
Conservation of Tropical Environments at the State University of
New York at Stony Brook and as international coordinator of
Ranomafana National Park, the rain forest in Antananarivo,
Madagascar, that was rescued by her dogged determination to save
the only known home of the newly found lemur.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wright is now in her thirteenth year of studying lemurs,
most recently the diademed sifaka, a large, black diurnal primate.
``I've finally come out of the dark,'' she noted, which makes her
work attractive to Earthwatch volunteers, amateur researchers who
pay to help support environmental research in interesting spots all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Ms. Wright and an expanded research team work
intensively during the six months a year that are not cyclone
season. Though Ms. Wright and co-workers still sleep in tents
without electricity, the campsite now has two buildings: a research
station and a dining hall. The onetime rice-and-beans diet has been
enhanced as well by a local cook who persuaded Ms. Wright to send
him to cooking school.
</P>
<P>
   During the off-season, Ms. Wright teaches graduate and
undergraduate courses on primate conservation and behavior and
ecology at Stony Brook. There she is joined by her second husband,
Jukka Jernvall, a Finnish paleontologist and developmental
biologist, who works at the University of Helsinki when she is in
Madagascar. He visits her there and they spend a month together
each summer in Finland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a tricontinental marriage,'' she said, obviously
pleased with the unusual arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   She is also pleased with her study subjects. The sifaka, a
spectacular leaping lemur that at 15 pounds is the biggest of the
living lemurs, is a lot easier to track than owl monkeys. One by
one, each animal is tranquilized and fitted with a color-coded
nylon necklace. Once a year, the animals are weighed and measured,
tooth impressions are taken and their reproductive condition noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with most other species of lemurs, the female sifaka rules
the roost,'' Ms. Wright explained. ``The female is first into the
fruit tree where she gets the best and most fruit. Her mate dares
not enter the tree until she's finished. If the male forgets and
starts up the tree, she'll slap him in the face. If he persists,
she'll lunge at him and may even nip him. He then backs away
saying, `I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The female also decides where the family group goes. Often two
or three females lead the way, with their mates trailing behind the
young. At six to nine months of age, young females start to play at
leadership, walking ahead of their mothers while the young males
stay with the mothers and eventually drift back to be with their
fathers, Ms. Wright has found.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, when it comes to courting, the females do the
choosing. The males do fight each other, she said, but often the
females don't choose the winners. According to the ``wimpy male
hypothesis'' formulated by Alison Richard, anthropologist at Yale
University, the female, by selecting a loser, may insure her
dominant status in the family.
</P>
<P>
   With the sifaka's habitat protected, Ms. Wright said the main
loss of research animals these days is the work of another endemic
species, the fossa, ``a fierce mongoose-like animal with big teeth
and a big appetite and retractible claws that enable it to climb
trees fast. The fossa is long, lean and mean and it eats lemurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in participating in future Earthwatch teams
with Ms. Wright should call 1-800-776-0188 for more information.
The next teams, each of which spends two weeks on the project,
depart on Nov. 1 and Nov. 15, 1998. See also the Earthwatch Website
at www.earthwatch.org for more information on lemur research.

   WASHINGTON _ The republic is safe for the summer _ Congress is
now on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   No more political damage can be done on Capitol Hill until
September, when our worthy legislators will return to a stack of
unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
   This hiatus is a good thing if you believe in minimalist
government but a problem if you believe there are national problems
that urgently demand national solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, members of Congress have been figuratively if not
literally out to lunch for months. They just haven't officially
admitted taking a perpetual holiday.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons why nothing much has been accomplished
thus far this year. High among them is a widespread boredom among
voters, who seem content these days to leave the nation's capital
to its own devices. Incumbents are looking good and feel no
pressure to demonstrate their usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   And Washington suffers from a pre-election disposition in both
parties toward confrontation rather than compromise, putting a
priority on building campaign issues instead of a legislative
record.
</P>
<P>
   All of which points to another last-minute federal budget
standoff in which nobody wins, including the public.
</P>
<P>
   The two government shutdowns in late 1995 and early 1996 over a
budget stalemate proved so politically unpopular that President
Clinton and the Republican majority are wary of taking that route
again. Yet both sides are already threatening to close the
government in October over seemingly irreconcilable differences in
major spending bills. It is down-to-the-wire bluffing that in the
name of political sanity ought to collapse in the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP in particular took a heavy hit for being inappropriately
gleeful over those past federal closings. The party cannot afford
to repeat that mistake. But if worse comes to worst, congressional
GOP leaders are trying to set up President Clinton for the fall
this time.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans inserted in seven major spending bills
right-wing ideological provisions they knew the president had vowed
to veto. They involve abortion, the environment and other issues
that he is firmly committed to.
</P>
<P>
   Their defense of this provocation is innocent surprise that he's
sticking to his guns, coupled with the sly assertion that he's
merely trying to distract us from his personal legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   It's a transparently partisan tactic and unlikely to either
force him to buckle or stick him with the blame if budgetary
disaster strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have suggested they might pass a so-called
continuing resolution to freeze the budget at this year's fiscal
levels if the president doesn't capitulate. But he's threatened to
veto that approach too. Fighting an image of declining political
power, Clinton is loathe to give up any remaining leverage to
reverse the congressional rejection of his budget initiatives for
domestic programs like education and managed health care.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, congressional strategy has been to slow government to
a leisurely crawl to allow plenty of time to put on a display of
partisan differences for voter consumption.
</P>
<P>
   After the legislators return, they plan to spend only one month
on the job before leaving town again to campaign for re-election.
That does not leave much time to reach agreement on major
controversies.
</P>
<P>
   It also doesn't leave much time to begin dealing with whatever
evidence is included in Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report
to Congress on alleged presidential wrongdoing. And that's just the
way Congress likes it. Only partisan anti-Clinton zealots have much
stomach just before an election for a sex-scandal probe that could
easily backfire.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans figure they can deal more smoothly with leftover
topics later _ even a debate about presidential sex and lies _ if
they strengthen their grip on both houses of Congress in the
November elections. The Democrats also figure they can cut a better
deal later if they narrow their minority margin or even,
miraculously, take back control of the House of Representatives.
Wishful thinking predominates in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has yet to pass 13 contentious appropriations bills for
the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, if it is to avoid a government
shutdown or a shootout with the president over a continuing
resolution. Campaign finance reform, anti-smoking legislation and
managed care revisions are already dead in one house or the other.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate GOP leaders can't agree on how large to make
new tax cuts or whom they should go to. The Republicans wasted
their time passing several anti-abortion measures, some of which
are irrelevant amendments to important bills and none of which will
get past presidential vetoes. Sharp ideological differences over
the correct remedies for classroom ills have stymied comprehensive
education legislation. Competing managed care reforms are too
complex to resolve in one month.
</P>
<P>
   Congress did reform the Internal Revenue Service and hand out
gobs of money for new highway construction, developments popular
with voters and both parties. Republican members re-named
Washington National Airport after Ronald Reagan, over anguished
Democratic objections. And that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   Having exhausted their teeny political repertoire, members of
Congress accidentally timed their August retreat to their
advantage. President Clinton will now have the national political
stage all to himself, for better or worse.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the droughty interior Northeast received much-needed
rain as over an inch of precipitation fell in many locations. On
Tuesday beneficial rain from scattered thunderstorms will douse
much of New England as a cool front crossing the region aids in
lifting the humid air in place. Local flooding is possible in a few
locations, especially from near the Berkshires to interior Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, clouds will yield to intervals of sunshine and
less humid air from the Ohio Valley to the eastern Great Lakes.
Isolated thundershowers will develop in the afternoon, as a trough
of low pressure presses east through the region. Behind the trough,
cool and very dry air will spread into the upper Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Sultry air will persist from the southern Plains to the
Southeast. As the sun heats the damp ground, rising currents of
moistening air will induce towering cumulus clouds to form, some of
which will produce strong thunderstorms. A cluster of more numerous
showers and thunderstorms will accompany a jet-stream disturbance
sliding through the lower Mississippi Valley while Texas stays
mainly sunny and hot.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated potent thunderstorms, replete with small hail and gusty
winds, will also surround a disturbance crossing the western high
Plains. Meanwhile, mostly sunny and warm conditions will cover an
expansive region from the northern Rockies to the northwest coast.
Elsewhere, moisture from the remnants of Tropical Storm Frank will
fuel scattered thunderstorms over the southern Rockies and Front
Range of Colorado and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Frankly Hot
</P>
<P>
   As the remnants of Tropical Storm Frank moved toward southern
California on Sunday, its circulation reversed the normal summer
weather pattern in the region. Clouds covered the deserts and
bright sun graced the coast. Winds from the southeast directed
tropical moisture and showers from the Gulf of California into the
Imperial Valley, causing readings to stay in the low 90s in the
deserts. These winds then descended the San Bernardino Mountains
and brought record heat to the Los Angeles Basin. The mercury rose
to 100 degrees at the Civic Center, eclipsing a record set in 1935.

A 10TH-CENTURY CHURCH IS RESCUED IN OLD CAIRO  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ In a city whose modern sprawl so often threatens
ancient treasures, the Egyptian government has begun an unusual
effort to preserve a religious site that has suffered from years of
neglect and bungled repairs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The two-year project stands out because it targets not one of
the Pharaonic temples or Islamic monuments for which Egypt is
better known but a Coptic Christian church in old Cairo, a crowded,
gritty quarter often bypassed by visitors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 10th-century basilica, known as the Hanging Church, is built
atop the remnants of a far more ancient Roman fortress. Its name
refers to its precarious design; the floor of palm-wood beams hangs
in midair, supported only at the edges by three Roman columns.
</P>
<P>
   It is among the oldest churches of its kind in Cairo, but until
the $6.7 million renovation began earlier this year, many here
feared that it might be near collapse. The earthquake that rocked
the city in 1992 left its walls badly cracked, while layers of
paint fell regularly from its ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   And although the church has been renovated several times in this
century alone, some previous efforts had caused more damage than
was fixed. In 1983 an engineer ordered that an interior column be
removed, then watched in horror as the chapel ceiling it had
supported came crashing to the floor, destroying all the artwork
inside the chapel.
</P>
<P>
   More recently _ and more worrisomely _ a mysterious pool of
ground water that had long sat at the foot of the Roman fortress
had begun to rise steadily, carrying salts and bacteria that were
weakening the pillars on which the structure rests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To some Coptic Christians, who make up about 10 percent of
Egypt's population of 62 million, the fate of the Hanging Church
had begun to seem like a metaphor for their ancient community,
which many complain has been denied its due respect.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the restoration is finally under way, Egyptian
antiquities officials point to the church as an example of their
commitment to preserving the country's multireligious heritage.
``This is not a pharaonic, Islamic or religious issue,'' said Ali
Hassan, then chairman of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities,
when the decision to go forward with the project was announced last
fall. ``This is about restoring monuments.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the site is called the Church of the Virgin, named
for Mary, who is reputed to have once stayed the night just a few
hundred yards away on the grounds of what is now St. Sarguis
Church. The Hanging Church is without domes but has a wooden roof
in the shape of Noah's Ark, a symbol of salvation.
</P>
<P>
   According to archeologists, the first Coptic church on the site
was built late in the third century; the one now standing, itself
more than 1,000 years old, replaced a church thought to have burned
down. It is decorated with icons carved from ebony and ivory; its
three chapels, guarded by carved wooden screens, are dedicated to
Christ, St. George and John the Baptist.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To the devout Copts, the importance of Coptic sites in Egypt has
been elevated since 1996, when Pope Shenouda III, the Coptic
patriarch, prohibited followers from visiting Christian holy sites
in Jerusalem, a ruling meant to protest Israel's hard-line stance
in negotiating a broader peace with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, the headquarters of the church and home to the world's
greatest concentration of Copts, church elders say its effect has
been to transform the capital into a ``second Jerusalem.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As repairs begin, the Rev. Jacob Soleiman, pastor of the Hanging
Church, said in an interview that it was in large part for these
reasons that he planned to continue to hold weekly services
throughout the two-year renovation project, ``even if we have to
hold them in the hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Coptic officials say they intend to keep the church
open to visitors who still arrive, a few score a day, to marvel at
the intimacy of its ancient art and woodwork. Worshipers and
visitors will face some inconvenience at least until the end of
1999, when the project is scheduled to be completed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since work began six months ago, engineers have devoted nearly
all their time to draining the ground water. With the help of noisy
pumps, they have reduced the water level around the pillars by more
than 15 feet, while driving away thousands of bats who had found
the humid quarters an ideal refuge. Initial tests suggest that a
nearby aquifer is the principal source of the water. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But they fear that the water could threaten other sites in old
Cairo, including a synagogue. And as workmen labor in the muck
where the ground water once lay, nearly every day they recover
broken pieces of wall decorations that have crumbled over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the next stages of restoration a temporary
home has been built for artwork that will have to be moved from the
ancient structure. ``Nothing lasts forever, but our job is to do
the best we can,'' said Father Soleiman. &QL;

   ``Remember the old days when the biggest laundry problem in this
country was ring around the collar?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This Ken Starr, he's a loser. 40 million bucks to get one
woman to talk dirty to you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure seems to be building on President Clinton. People
want him to explain his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Forget
that! I'd be happy if Clinton would just explain his relationship
with Hillary. That's the one I want to know about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, Hillary Clinton spoke out about this whole stain
business. She blamed it on a vast right-hand conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``According to a new poll, 66 percent of Americans think that
President Clinton had an affair with Monica Lewinsky. The other 34
percent think he just had an affair with her dress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI has just finished the first round of testing on Monica
Lewinsky's dress. So far they've concluded that the dress is 50%
rayon.''

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Soup Nazi? Well, recently I came across the Shoe
Nazi. It was my first visit to his store near Lexington and 77th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, as a customer, I was a bit trying.
</P>
<P>
   I found a perfect pair of evening shoes and thought I should
take advantage of the store's sale and buy a pair of sandals.
</P>
<P>
   As the clerk was writing up the sale, I began to waver about the
nice-but-not-perfect sandals. I told the clerk to forget them.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, they were nice, and I did need them. ``OK, OK, I'll
take them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot flash about another pair bought earlier in the year but
never worn. ``No, no, forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner, listening nearby, grabbed the sales slip, ripped it
up and demanded that I leave the store with neither pair.
</P>
<P>
   Is my memory playing tricks, or did he actually say ``No shoes
for you''?
</P>
<P>
   The acute desire to walk away was trumped by my deep love and
need for the evening shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Mortified, I said, ``But I must have the first pair.'' He was
adamant.
</P>
<P>
   I begged: ``Please, please let me buy the shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No! Out!''
</P>
<P>
   Degradation: ``I beg you. They're perfect. Please don't do this
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you'll take both pairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowed and broken: ``Yes, I will take both.''
</P>
<P>
   End note: The dubious sandals are working out well. I wonder how
long I'll have to lie low before I show my face there again.

   Just one more ``Titanic'' story: Meryl Wiener's 11-year-old son
did not know the history of the ill-fated vessel, so she told him
all about it before taking him to the movie.
</P>
<P>
   After two hours, with still no hint of impending disaster, he
tapped her on the shoulder and asked, ``Are you sure this ship
sinks?''
</P>
<P>
   The dog, a young, muscular pit-bull mix with a thick chain-link
collar, had dug his paws in near the West 91st Street exit of
Central Park and refused to move.
</P>
<P>
   The owner _ black baseball cap, large sunglasses, tall, tough as
his pet _ was tugging on the leash trying to persuade him to walk
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' he said. The dog did not budge. ``Get moving.'' No
response. ``It's time to go home.'' Still no motion.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine T. Becher watched as the man, exasperated, scooped the
dog up in his arms and said, in all seriousness: ``Look here, we
have to get this straight right now. I don't speak dog so you'd
better plan on learning English.''
</P>
<P>
   Scene: A crowded crosstown bus headed east during the 57th
Street morning rush.
</P>
<P>
   I signal for an exit at Seventh Avenue, and the driver pulls
alongside the bus stop _ with a cab smack dab in front of the back
exit. I try to exit, but the doors barely open, because of the cab.
</P>
<P>
   I politely ask the cabby to move his empty cab, as there is
nothing between his cab and the corner. The cab moves about 2 feet.
I still cannot exit the bus without really squeezing between the
dirty bus doors and the dirty cab. I ask the cabby to move some
more. He doesn't move.
</P>
<P>
   A large male passenger behind me is also yelling at the cabby,
angry and kicking the cab. The cabby is now angry too, but seeing a
large male he stays in his cab, still not budging.
</P>
<P>
   I say to my fellow passenger, ``Shall we go through?'' He
answers, ``Of course.''
</P>
<P>
   So I step out through the partially open bus door, open the back
door of the cab and slide through, with the fellow following. We
exit onto the sidewalk _ and leave both back doors of the cab wide
open as we go our separate ways.

   Eleanor Spitz's second-grade class had a ``show and tell''
during snack time. Dawn told about a visit to her grandfather, an
optometrist. Ms. Spitz asked where he practiced, to which Dawn
replied: ``He doesn't practice anymore. He knows how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The young panhandler on Park Avenue was getting an unusual
reaction from passers-by. They would read his sign, smile or laugh
and pass on without giving him a contribution.
</P>
<P>
   As Grace Grant approached the sign, she understood their
reluctance. In his case, honesty wasn't the best policy. In big
letters he had written: ``Why lie, I need a beer!''

   Vanessa Hoffman spent more than an hour on a recent humid day
deciding what to wear. She finally pulled together a stylish
combination of black pedal pushers and a black tank-type top with
Asian-inspired embroidery.
</P>
<P>
   As she was ambling along midtown, a little girl, about 8 years
old and wearing a yellow flowered dress, was walking behind her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do people in New York only wear black?'' the child asked
her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoffman was understandably chagrined at the reply. ``Maybe
because they don't want to look pretty,'' the mother said.

   Selma Marx was standing in a movie line with a recently widowed
friend when the man in front of them lighted a large cigar. The
friend voiced an objection.
</P>

   The man replied: ``What's the matter, lady? Doesn't your husband
smoke?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not anymore,'' she said.

   When Kitty and Raymond Katzell lived in New York, their
out-of-town friends were no different from thousands of others who
repeated the mantra ``New York is a great place to visit, but I'd
sure hate to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Now living in Medford, N.J., the Katzells decided to spend some
of their vacation as Big Apple tourists. They took a room in a
midtown hotel and did the town _ Statue of Liberty, Empire State
Building, Circle Line cruise, museums, etc. In the evenings they
had dinner at various restaurants before dashing off to theaters
and concerts.
</P>
<P>
   After a week, they were preparing to drag themselves home. Mrs.
Katzell said with a sigh, ``New York is a great place to live, but
I'd sure hate to visit here.''

</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``So what's the problem?''

   A college student picked up his date at her parents home. He'd
scraped together every cent he had to take her to a fancy
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   To his dismay, she ordered almost everything expensive on the
menu _ appetizers, lobster, champagne ... the works.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he asked her, `Does your mother feed you like this at
home?
</P>
<P>
   `No,` she said, `but my mother's not looking to get ... (yeah,
you got it) either.`
</P>

</P>
<P>
   A veterinarian surgeon had had a bad day, but when he got home
from tending to all the sick animals, his wife was waiting with a
long cool drink and a romantic candle-lit dinner. After dinner,
they had a few more drinks and went happily to bed.
</P>
<P>
   At about 2:00 in the morning, the phone rang. `Is this the vet?`
asked an elderly lady's voice.
</P>
<P>
   `Yes, it is,` replied the vet, `Is this an emergency?`
</P>
<P>
   `Well, sort of`, said the elderly lady, `there's a whole bunch
of cats on the roof outside making a terrible noise mating and I
can't get to sleep. What can I do about it?`

<P>
   There was a sharp intake of breath from the vet, who then
patiently replied, `Open the window and tell them they're wanted on
the phone.`
</P>
<P>
   `Really?` said the elderly lady, `Will that stop them?`

<P>
   &UR; GOOD POINT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Attending a wedding for the first time, a little girl whispered
to her mother, `Why is the bride dressed in white?`
</P>
<P>
   `Because white is the color of happiness and today is the
happiest day of her life,` her mother tried to explain, keeping it
simple.
</P>
<P>
   The child thought about this for a moment, then said, `So, why's
the groom wearing black?`

   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody know what D.C. stands for? Dry Cleaning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the old days when the biggest laundry problem in this
country was ring around the collar?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This Ken Starr, he's a loser. 40 million bucks to get one
woman to talk dirty to you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure seems to be building on President Clinton. People
want him to explain his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Forget
that! I'd be happy if Clinton would just explain his relationship
with Hillary. That's the one I want to know about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, Hillary Clinton spoke out about this whole stain
business. She blamed it on a vast right-hand conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``According to a new poll, 66 percent of Americans think that
President Clinton had an affair with Monica Lewinsky. The other 34
percent think he just had an affair with her dress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI has just finished the first round of testing on Monica
Lewinsky's dress. So far they've concluded that the dress is 50%
rayon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A North Carolina man has been accused of putting the cremated
remains of his aunt in movie theater popcorn. Apparently, people
are outraged, saying that his aunt isn't worth $4.75.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, 15 boy scouts from Minnesota had to be rescued
after they became lost in the Cascade Mountains. At first rescuers
tried to find the boys with bloodhounds and when that didn't work,
they brought in Michael Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry Manilow announced he's coming out with an album of Frank
Sinatra songs. The title song is 'I Did it My Way and It Sucks.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists on Long Island have discovered a drug that may be
effective in treating cocaine addiction. Unfortunately, the drug
they're talking about is crack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, Irish swimming champion Michele Smith was banned
from international competition for tampering with her drug test by
putting alcohol in her urine sample. They asked her for a comment
and Smith said, 'Look, where I come from, everyone has alcohol in
their urine sample.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``This week, burglars broke into a Tennessee pharmacy and stole
450 Viagra pills. The suspects are reported to be armed, dangerous
and wearing extremely baggy pants.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Soup Nazi? Well, recently I came across the Shoe
Nazi. It was my first visit to his store near Lexington and 77th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, as a customer, I was a bit trying.
</P>
<P>
   I found a perfect pair of evening shoes and thought I should
take advantage of the store's sale and buy a pair of sandals.
</P>
<P>
   As the clerk was writing up the sale, I began to waver about the
nice-but-not-perfect sandals. I told the clerk to forget them.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, they were nice, and I did need them. ``OK, OK, I'll
take them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot flash about another pair bought earlier in the year but
never worn. ``No, no, forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner, listening nearby, grabbed the sales slip, ripped it
up and demanded that I leave the store with neither pair.
</P>
<P>
   Is my memory playing tricks, or did he actually say ``No shoes
for you''?
</P>
<P>
   The acute desire to walk away was trumped by my deep love and
need for the evening shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Mortified, I said, ``But I must have the first pair.'' He was
adamant.
</P>
<P>
   I begged: ``Please, please let me buy the shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No! Out!''
</P>
<P>
   Degradation: ``I beg you. They're perfect. Please don't do this
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you'll take both pairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowed and broken: ``Yes, I will take both.''
</P>
<P>
   End note: The dubious sandals are working out well. I wonder how
long I'll have to lie low before I show my face there again.
</P>
<P>
   _ BARBARA S. GINSBERG
</P>
<P>
   Just one more ``Titanic'' story: Meryl Wiener's 11-year-old son
did not know the history of the ill-fated vessel, so she told him
all about it before taking him to the movie.
</P>
<P>
   After two hours, with still no hint of impending disaster, he
tapped her on the shoulder and asked, ``Are you sure this ship
sinks?''
</P>
<P>
   The dog, a young, muscular pit-bull mix with a thick chain-link
collar, had dug his paws in near the West 91st Street exit of
Central Park and refused to move.
</P>
<P>
   The owner _ black baseball cap, large sunglasses, tall, tough as
his pet _ was tugging on the leash trying to persuade him to walk
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' he said. The dog did not budge. ``Get moving.'' No
response. ``It's time to go home.'' Still no motion.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine T. Becher watched as the man, exasperated, scooped the
dog up in his arms and said, in all seriousness: ``Look here, we
have to get this straight right now. I don't speak dog so you'd
better plan on learning English.''
</P>
<P>
   Scene: A crowded crosstown bus headed east during the 57th
Street morning rush.
</P>
<P>
   I signal for an exit at Seventh Avenue, and the driver pulls
alongside the bus stop _ with a cab smack dab in front of the back
exit. I try to exit, but the doors barely open, because of the cab.
</P>
<P>
   I politely ask the cabby to move his empty cab, as there is
nothing between his cab and the corner. The cab moves about 2 feet.
I still cannot exit the bus without really squeezing between the
dirty bus doors and the dirty cab. I ask the cabby to move some
more. He doesn't move.
</P>
<P>
   A large male passenger behind me is also yelling at the cabby,
angry and kicking the cab. The cabby is now angry too, but seeing a
large male he stays in his cab, still not budging.
</P>
<P>
   I say to my fellow passenger, ``Shall we go through?'' He
answers, ``Of course.''
</P>
<P>
   So I step out through the partially open bus door, open the back
door of the cab and slide through, with the fellow following. We
exit onto the sidewalk _ and leave both back doors of the cab wide
open as we go our separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   _ KAREN LUERSSEN
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Spitz's second-grade class had a ``show and tell''
during snack time. Dawn told about a visit to her grandfather, an
optometrist. Ms. Spitz asked where he practiced, to which Dawn
replied: ``He doesn't practice anymore. He knows how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The young panhandler on Park Avenue was getting an unusual
reaction from passers-by. They would read his sign, smile or laugh
and pass on without giving him a contribution.
</P>
<P>
   As Grace Grant approached the sign, she understood their
reluctance. In his case, honesty wasn't the best policy. In big
letters he had written: ``Why lie, I need a beer!''
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa Hoffman spent more than an hour on a recent humid day
deciding what to wear. She finally pulled together a stylish
combination of black pedal pushers and a black tank-type top with
Asian-inspired embroidery.
</P>
<P>
   As she was ambling along midtown, a little girl, about 8 years
old and wearing a yellow flowered dress, was walking behind her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do people in New York only wear black?'' the child asked
her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoffman was understandably chagrined at the reply. ``Maybe
because they don't want to look pretty,'' the mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Selma Marx was standing in a movie line with a recently widowed
friend when the man in front of them lighted a large cigar. The
friend voiced an objection.
</P>
<P>
   The man replied: ``What's the matter, lady? Doesn't your husband
smoke?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not anymore,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Kitty and Raymond Katzell lived in New York, their
out-of-town friends were no different from thousands of others who
repeated the mantra ``New York is a great place to visit, but I'd
sure hate to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Now living in Medford, N.J., the Katzells decided to spend some
of their vacation as Big Apple tourists. They took a room in a
midtown hotel and did the town _ Statue of Liberty, Empire State
Building, Circle Line cruise, museums, etc. In the evenings they
had dinner at various restaurants before dashing off to theaters
and concerts.
</P>
<P>
   After a week, they were preparing to drag themselves home. Mrs.
Katzell said with a sigh, ``New York is a great place to live, but
I'd sure hate to visit here.''
</P>
<P>
   Scene: A Madison Avenue coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   Players: Two well-dressed women, probably in their 40s, and
Helene Bell, who overhears this conversation:
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``He's very nice, well-mannered, good-looking.
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``So what's the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``I have a feeling he's married, but I don't want
to ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``No problem. Just tell him you think you know his
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IS THIS DIRTY-I? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A college student picked up his date at her parents home. He'd
scraped together every cent he had to take her to a fancy
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   To his dismay, she ordered almost everything expensive on the
menu _ appetizers, lobster, champagne ... the works.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he asked her, `Does your mother feed you like this at
home?
</P>
<P>
   `No,` she said, `but my mother's not looking to get ... (yeah,
you got it) either.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IS THIS DIRTY-II? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A veterinarian surgeon had had a bad day, but when he got home
from tending to all the sick animals, his wife was waiting with a
long cool drink and a romantic candle-lit dinner. After dinner,
they had a few more drinks and went happily to bed.
</P>
<P>
   At about 2:00 in the morning, the phone rang. `Is this the vet?`
asked an elderly lady's voice.
</P>
<P>
   `Yes, it is,` replied the vet, `Is this an emergency?`
</P>
<P>
   `Well, sort of`, said the elderly lady, `there's a whole bunch
of cats on the roof outside making a terrible noise mating and I
can't get to sleep. What can I do about it?`
</P>
<P>
   There was a sharp intake of breath from the vet, who then
patiently replied, `Open the window and tell them they're wanted on
the phone.`
</P>
<P>
   `Really?` said the elderly lady, `Will that stop them?`
</P>
<P>
   `It should,` said the vet, `it stopped ME!`

out-of-town friends were no different from thousands of others who
repeated the mantra ``New York is a great place to visit, but I'd
sure hate to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Now living in Medford, N.J., the Katzells decided to spend some
of their vacation as Big Apple tourists. They took a room in a
midtown hotel and did the town _ Statue of Liberty, Empire State
Building, Circle Line cruise, museums, etc. In the evenings they
had dinner at various restaurants before dashing off to theaters
and concerts.
</P>
<P>
   After a week, they were preparing to drag themselves home. Mrs.
Katzell said with a sigh, ``New York is a great place to live, but
I'd sure hate to visit here.''
</P>
<P>
   Scene: A Madison Avenue coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   Players: Two well-dressed women, probably in their 40s, and
Helene Bell, who overhears this conversation:
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``He's very nice, well-mannered, good-looking.
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``So what's the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``I have a feeling he's married, but I don't want
to ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``No problem. Just tell him you think you know his
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IS THIS DIRTY-I? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A college student picked up his date at her parents home. He'd
scraped together every cent he had to take her to a fancy
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   To his dismay, she ordered almost everything expensive on the
menu _ appetizers, lobster, champagne ... the works.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he asked her, `Does your mother feed you like this at
home?
</P>
<P>
   `No,` she said, `but my mother's not looking to get ... (yeah,
you got it) either.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IS THIS DIRTY-II? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A veterinarian surgeon had had a bad day, but when he got home
from tending to all the sick animals, his wife was waiting with a
long cool drink and a romantic candle-lit dinner. After dinner,
they had a few more drinks and went happily to bed.
</P>
<P>
   At about 2:00 in the morning, the phone rang. `Is this the vet?`
asked an elderly lady's voice.
</P>
<P>
   `Yes, it is,` replied the vet, `Is this an emergency?`
</P>
<P>
   `Well, sort of`, said the elderly lady, `there's a whole bunch
of cats on the roof outside making a terrible noise mating and I
can't get to sleep. What can I do about it?`
</P>
<P>
   There was a sharp intake of breath from the vet, who then
patiently replied, `Open the window and tell them they're wanted on
the phone.`
</P>
<P>
   `Really?` said the elderly lady, `Will that stop them?`
</P>
<P>
   `It should,` said the vet, `it stopped ME!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUMPERMANIA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of pedestrians _ the quick and the dead.
</P>
<P>
   A closed mouth gathers no feet.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to meet expenses, they're everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GOOD POINT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Attending a wedding for the first time, a little girl whispered
to her mother, `Why is the bride dressed in white?`
</P>
<P>
   `Because white is the color of happiness and today is the
happiest day of her life,` her mother tried to explain, keeping it
simple.
</P>
<P>
   The child thought about this for a moment, then said, `So, why's
the groom wearing black?`

   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody know what D.C. stands for? Dry Cleaning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the old days when the biggest laundry problem in this
country was ring around the collar?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This Ken Starr, he's a loser. 40 million bucks to get one
woman to talk dirty to you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure seems to be building on President Clinton. People
want him to explain his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Forget
that! I'd be happy if Clinton would just explain his relationship
with Hillary. That's the one I want to know about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, Hillary Clinton spoke out about this whole stain
business. She blamed it on a vast right-hand conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``According to a new poll, 66 percent of Americans think that
President Clinton had an affair with Monica Lewinsky. The other 34
percent think he just had an affair with her dress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI has just finished the first round of testing on Monica
Lewinsky's dress. So far they've concluded that the dress is 50%
rayon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A North Carolina man has been accused of putting the cremated
remains of his aunt in movie theater popcorn. Apparently, people
are outraged, saying that his aunt isn't worth $4.75.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, 15 boy scouts from Minnesota had to be rescued
after they became lost in the Cascade Mountains. At first rescuers
tried to find the boys with bloodhounds and when that didn't work,
they brought in Michael Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry Manilow announced he's coming out with an album of Frank
Sinatra songs. The title song is 'I Did it My Way and It Sucks.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists on Long Island have discovered a drug that may be
effective in treating cocaine addiction. Unfortunately, the drug
they're talking about is crack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, Irish swimming champion Michele Smith was banned
from international competition for tampering with her drug test by
putting alcohol in her urine sample. They asked her for a comment
and Smith said, 'Look, where I come from, everyone has alcohol in
their urine sample.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``This week, burglars broke into a Tennessee pharmacy and stole
450 Viagra pills. The suspects are reported to be armed, dangerous
and wearing extremely baggy pants.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Soup Nazi? Well, recently I came across the Shoe
Nazi. It was my first visit to his store near Lexington and 77th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, as a customer, I was a bit trying.
</P>
<P>
   I found a perfect pair of evening shoes and thought I should
take advantage of the store's sale and buy a pair of sandals.
</P>
<P>
   As the clerk was writing up the sale, I began to waver about the
nice-but-not-perfect sandals. I told the clerk to forget them.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, they were nice, and I did need them. ``OK, OK, I'll
take them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot flash about another pair bought earlier in the year but
never worn. ``No, no, forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner, listening nearby, grabbed the sales slip, ripped it
up and demanded that I leave the store with neither pair.
</P>
<P>
   Is my memory playing tricks, or did he actually say ``No shoes
for you''?
</P>
<P>
   The acute desire to walk away was trumped by my deep love and
need for the evening shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Mortified, I said, ``But I must have the first pair.'' He was
adamant.
</P>
<P>
   I begged: ``Please, please let me buy the shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No! Out!''
</P>
<P>
   Degradation: ``I beg you. They're perfect. Please don't do this
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you'll take both pairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowed and broken: ``Yes, I will take both.''
</P>
<P>
   End note: The dubious sandals are working out well. I wonder how
long I'll have to lie low before I show my face there again.
</P>
<P>
   _ BARBARA S. GINSBERG
</P>
<P>
   Just one more ``Titanic'' story: Meryl Wiener's 11-year-old son
did not know the history of the ill-fated vessel, so she told him
all about it before taking him to the movie.
</P>
<P>
   After two hours, with still no hint of impending disaster, he
tapped her on the shoulder and asked, ``Are you sure this ship
sinks?''
</P>
<P>
   The dog, a young, muscular pit-bull mix with a thick chain-link
collar, had dug his paws in near the West 91st Street exit of
Central Park and refused to move.
</P>
<P>
   The owner _ black baseball cap, large sunglasses, tall, tough as
his pet _ was tugging on the leash trying to persuade him to walk
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' he said. The dog did not budge. ``Get moving.'' No
response. ``It's time to go home.'' Still no motion.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine T. Becher watched as the man, exasperated, scooped the
dog up in his arms and said, in all seriousness: ``Look here, we
have to get this straight right now. I don't speak dog so you'd
better plan on learning English.''
</P>
<P>
   Scene: A crowded crosstown bus headed east during the 57th
Street morning rush.
</P>
<P>
   I signal for an exit at Seventh Avenue, and the driver pulls
alongside the bus stop _ with a cab smack dab in front of the back
exit. I try to exit, but the doors barely open, because of the cab.
</P>
<P>
   I politely ask the cabby to move his empty cab, as there is
nothing between his cab and the corner. The cab moves about 2 feet.
I still cannot exit the bus without really squeezing between the
dirty bus doors and the dirty cab. I ask the cabby to move some
more. He doesn't move.
</P>
<P>
   A large male passenger behind me is also yelling at the cabby,
angry and kicking the cab. The cabby is now angry too, but seeing a
large male he stays in his cab, still not budging.
</P>
<P>
   I say to my fellow passenger, ``Shall we go through?'' He
answers, ``Of course.''
</P>
<P>
   So I step out through the partially open bus door, open the back
door of the cab and slide through, with the fellow following. We
exit onto the sidewalk _ and leave both back doors of the cab wide
open as we go our separate ways.
</P>

   Eleanor Spitz's second-grade class had a ``show and tell''
during snack time. Dawn told about a visit to her grandfather, an
optometrist. Ms. Spitz asked where he practiced, to which Dawn
replied: ``He doesn't practice anymore. He knows how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The young panhandler on Park Avenue was getting an unusual
reaction from passers-by. They would read his sign, smile or laugh
and pass on without giving him a contribution.
</P>
<P>
   As Grace Grant approached the sign, she understood their
reluctance. In his case, honesty wasn't the best policy. In big
letters he had written: ``Why lie, I need a beer!''
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa Hoffman spent more than an hour on a recent humid day
deciding what to wear. She finally pulled together a stylish
combination of black pedal pushers and a black tank-type top with
Asian-inspired embroidery.
</P>
<P>
   As she was ambling along midtown, a little girl, about 8 years
old and wearing a yellow flowered dress, was walking behind her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do people in New York only wear black?'' the child asked
her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoffman was understandably chagrined at the reply. ``Maybe
because they don't want to look pretty,'' the mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Selma Marx was standing in a movie line with a recently widowed
friend when the man in front of them lighted a large cigar. The
friend voiced an objection.
</P>
<P>
   The man replied: ``What's the matter, lady? Doesn't your husband
smoke?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not anymore,'' she said.

SHANNEN-TV (Los Angeles) _ Shannen Doherty and Aaron Spelling are
back together again. After a very public Hollywood falling out that
led to her departure from ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' the two have
mended fences and she of temperamental reputation is back on the

IN SAN FRANCISCO, HIGH JINKS, BIG HAIR AND A SPIRIT THAT LASTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Try to follow this.
</P>
<P>
   Snow White is looking for love, preferably a handsome prince.
She meets up with Glinda the Good Witch and then embarks on a trip
around the world, during which she encounters President Clinton,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, Chelsea Clinton, Newt Gingrich, Paula
Jones, John Travolta, Mr. Peanut, Mayor Willie Brown Jr. of San
Francisco, the Spice Girls, a king of France, Whoopi Goldberg,
Richard Simmons, Carmen Miranda, Chiquita Banana, Ellen DeGeneres,
Janet Reno, the Village People, Barbra Streisand, Tina Turner,
James Brown, Monica Lewinsky, Linda Tripp, Kenneth Starr and Martha
Stewart (among others), after which she morphs into Madonna and
marries Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people she meets have very big hair.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to ``Beach Blanket Babylon.'' If
``Seinfeld'' was about nothing, this is about everything, a wild
musical homage to popular culture that has become no less a part of
San Francisco than the Golden Gate Bridge, the Coit Tower and fog.
It has played eight times a week 51 weeks a year for the last 24
years, and every show is a sellout in the 400-seat Club Fugazi.
</P>
<P>
   Are we talking quirky, or what? The producers are now planning
next year's 25th-anniversary celebration in which Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, a native of San Francisco, has agreed to play Snow White
for at least one performance. That means she will have to sing,
dance and wear about 16 pounds of makeup. Good thing she does not
face re-election until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's said she'll sing and dance,'' said Jo Shulman Silver,
the show's producer, leaving aside the issue of makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beach Blanket Babylon'' was the brainchild of Mrs. Silver's
husband, Steve Silver, a one-time street performer whose sense of
comic absurdity gave rise to lavish costumes, altered lyrics and
clever segues that deny the audience any pause from the moment Snow
White first appears onstage with a suitcase that says on the side
``A Prince or Bust, www.snow.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver died in 1995 at the age of 51, but his presence permeates
the production through the company's Zen-like reverence for him,
which has never faded. Mrs. Silver, who married him several months
before his death, talks of him in the present tense as if nothing
has changed, and in a sense it hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The show has proceeded essentially as Silver first staged it, a
set piece with 10 cast members in multiple roles and Snow White's
search as the unifying theme. Over the years, characters and songs
have come and gone to highlight contemporary issues. But whomever
Snow White meets along the way, the look and sound of every
character reflects Silver's fractured view of life and a comic
sensitivity that amuses but never offends.
</P>
<P>
   That perspective remains a guiding force for Mrs. Silver and
Kenny Mazlow, the director, who plays a number of characters,
including King Louis, of no specific Roman numeral, in a towering
pink wig and Peanut with a walking stick.
</P>
<P>
   Ever open to new ideas, they acknowledge nonetheless that they
always consider how Silver would have visualized a change. Mrs.
Silver, in fact, is convinced her husband can still hear her mental
gymnastics. ``I always think, `How would Steve do this?' '' she
said, sheepishly admitting that once last year she actually asked
him: ``Steve, what should I do? Give me a sign.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, at least, she and Mazlow continue to push the right
buttons. When the show made one of its rare trips outside San
Francisco, visiting London for several weeks last year, they
recognized the need to tailor certain scenes to a British sense of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   As one example, they turned the character of Richard Simmons, a
well-known American exerciser, into someone a British audience
would more easily recognize, a television muscle man known as
Motivator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience loved it,'' Mrs. Silver said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Some of the standard characters in ``Beach Blanket Babylon,''
like John Travolta and the Dancing Poodles, have endured over the
years. And much of the humor is timeless shtick, like the four
dancing Hasidic Jews, whose rendition of ``Hava Nagila'' comes out
``Have a Tequila.'' The show's version of the Village People turns
``Macho Man'' into ``Matzoh Man,'' and when the Spice Girls sing
``Tell me what you want, what you really, really want,'' they
include Old Spice, a dancing cologne bottle.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the show's bite evolves from its topical humor,
these days _ what else? _ the White House scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Monica Lewinsky character, who is usually played by Erica
Wyman in a giant beret, walks out with Tracy Chiappone as Linda
Tripp, carrying a huge tape recorder, and sings ``Wedding Bell
Blues,'' a Fifth Dimension song that begins, ``Bill, I love you
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week a Kenneth Starr character was added for the first
time. A backdrop opened to reveal Mazlow wearing a five-pointed
star helmet and singing a version of '`New York, New York'' that
began, ``Starr's spreading the news. Subpoenas today. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the show avoids any mention of the real Ms. Lewinsky's
blue dress, which is being examined by investigators for genetic
evidence of a sexual encounter with Clinton _ standard fare for
late-night television comedians. Mrs. Silver said she and Mazlow
considered adding the song ``Devil With the Blue Dress On'' but
then decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve would not have wanted that in the show,'' she said. ``He
always had the highest of standards. That would not be appropriate
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   What all the characters look like also plays a major role in the
show's popularity, almost to distraction. Val Diamond, who as a
20-year veteran is the longest-serving cast member, greets Snow
White everywhere along the way and always in a different silly
outfit and hairdo.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Diamond's stunning voice is a centerpiece of the production.
She actually belts out one song, unadulterated to its conclusion,
``Anyone Who Had a Heart.'' She is dressed as a sequined French
apache dancer with a lamppost poking out of her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beach Blanket Babylon'' was first performed in 1974 in the
back room of a North Beach bar as a spoof of old beach-blanket
movies that starred people like Frankie Avalon and Annette
Funicello. A year later it moved several blocks away to Club
Fugazi, where it has been evolving ever since.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, the show has been seen by more than three
million people over the years, including some who return dozens of
times. Cyril Magnin, the city's former chief of protocol, who died
in 1988, holds the unofficial record. He claimed to have attended
more than 500 times, occasionally as a member of the cast.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Mrs. Silver said, much of her time is occupied by plans
to stage 25 25th-anniversary benefit performances next June, each
for a different charity her husband supported. But tugging at her
is an idea that she said her husband might not have supported.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, she said, celebrities who see the show, as well
as close friends, ask why she has not taken ``Beach Blanket
Babylon'' on tour. Despite a few touches that link the story to San
Francisco, like the giant skyline hat Ms. Diamond wears in the
finale, the production could be tailored to anywhere, as it was for
London when Ms. Diamond's hat had a London skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Silver is not yet convinced it is the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' she said, looking perplexed. ``We've had
offers to go to New York, Los Angeles, South Africa, Australia,
Germany, France, Chicago, everywhere. But Steve never wanted to go
anywhere. What if we got a bad review? We've never gotten a bad
review. Never. I wouldn't do anything that hurts the show. I have
to do what's right for the show. What happens here is always my
priority. That's what Steve would have wanted.''

HEROES MOVE MANY TO TAKE UP FENCING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENIFER HANRAHAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; As a child, Pat Cherry stared up at the big
screen, watching reverently, his heroes saving beautiful damsels
and slaying villains with the slice of a sword.
</P>
<P>
   Zorro. The Three Musketeers. Cyrano de Bergerac.
</P>
<P>
   Those images of chivalrous men finally led Cherry to emulate
their art through fencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked romantic and fun,'' said the 39-year-old Temple City
man, who practices at Salle Swords, a fencing studio that opened
last year in Burbank. ``They always looked so confident, and
besides, they always got the girl.''
</P>
<P>
   But those on-screen swashbucklers who so inspired Cherry
wouldn't stand a chance in a duel with him nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Their grand, sweeping movements, the endless clank-clank of
rapiers slamming into each other, bears about as much resemblance
to real sword fighting as Antonio Banderas does to a typical felon.
</P>
<P>
   Fencers equate their sport to ``physical chess,'' in which
outfoxing the opponent with quick, small jabs like a boxer
determines who lives to fight another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In staged or theatrical combat, the idea is to make movements
the audience can follow,'' said Andy Shaw, manager of Westside
Fencing Center in Culver City, where a roster of more than 400
members makes it the largest of a handful of fencing studios in the
Los Angeles area. ``The movements go on and on, so people can feel
the buildup of the drama. In fencing, the idea is to make actions
that someone can't follow, because you don't want someone to parry
it or block it. You make movements that are intricate and
efficient. The better the fencer, the smaller the movement.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weeknight, Pat Cherry and Michele Chimienti, 25, of
Norwalk faced off with their feet shoulder-width apart and knees
slightly bent.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing full fencing gear _ white hooded mask, gloves, knickers
and jacket _ they lunged at each other with their epees.
</P>
<P>
   An epee, which weighs about 1 pound and is a yard long, is one
of three weapons used in fencing competitions, including the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Every time one made contact with the other's suit _ the contact
is called a ``touch'' _ a pressure sensor in the tip of the weapon
sent an electronic signal through a wire running from the hand,
through the suit, to a machine on a wall. The signal caused a light
to go off that indicated who scored the point.
</P>
<P>
   In epee, every part of the body is fair game, even the feet, and
Chimienti kept Cherry jumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fencing is a mind game,'' she said later. ``Even though men
are stronger and faster, women can win.''
</P>
<P>
   While the adults dueled, children's instructor Loy Hopkins, 44,
of Lake View Terrace, did her best to bring some structure to her
class of youngsters only too eager to run around hitting sticks
together.
</P>
<P>
   But like a soccer coach trying to explain defense to
6-year-olds, the kids seemed to be more intent on having fun with
their foam rubber swords than learning about lunges and retreats.
</P>
<P>
   After a half hour of drills, Gavin Quan, 6, rushed over to his
dad and tore off his face mask.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many soccer and baseball dads, Gavin Quan's dad had
something to say about his son's technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to lunge forward, like this,'' said his father,
Glenn, grabbing a sword.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad, you go take my place,'' the plucky 6-year-old replied.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, Glenn Quan said he planned to sign up next
month. He's contemplated it ever since seeing Luke Skywalker's
glowing, magical sword two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even though theatrical fencing is phony in the eyes of real-life
fencers, most fencers won't lash out at their choreographed
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Errol Flynn helped the fencers of old, today's movies
and television shows, such as ``Xena: Warrior Princess'' and even
the animated ``Mulan'' are attracting new fencers to the sport,
said Kerry Logan, director of SwordPlay, a fencing studio that
opened six years ago in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Fencing Association reports nearly 14,000
people belong to certified fencing studios in the United States.
The number has been growing steadily since 1995, when membership
was less than 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   SwordPlay even offers classes in specialty weapons such as the
quarterstaff, a stick that is held in both hands, and cloak and
dagger, in which the cape is used as a shield.
</P>
<P>
   Most students working with specialty weapons are actors getting
ready for a part, although ``Braveheart'' sparked an interest among
the general public in learning the broadsword.
</P>
<P>
   Even Michelle Pfieffer came in to learn how to hit a target with
a bull whip in ``Batman Returns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few years in particular, fencing has become much
more of a popular sport,'' Logan said. ``We've been trying to catch
the wave of popularity by performing at fairs and festivals and
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Students from Salle Swords fencing studio performed in front of
Burbank movie theaters during the opening of ``Zorro.''
</P>
<P>
   Fencing, which is considered a martial art, is also getting a
boost from an increase in popularity of other martial arts, such as
kickboxing, Logan said.
</P>
<P>
   But the sport of fencing was well-established throughout the
world centuries before anyone ever dreamed of the silver screen.
Popular since the 16th century, fencing is one of the world's
oldest sports. When guns that could actually be aimed rendered
armor of little use to soldiers, fencing was transformed into a
gentleman's game, mostly practiced by the upper class, said Shaw,
historian for the U.S. Fencing Association.
</P>
<P>
   There were fencing clubs in the United States as early as the
mid-1700s. The first national championships for men were held in
1888; women's came later, in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sense of tradition, a harkening back to days of
chivalry and romance, that drew Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you put that mask on, you're not that person's friend.
You're their enemy,'' she said. ``At that moment, you're so much
into the heat of the battle, you don't hear anything, see anything
or feel anything but that person in front of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Fencers say that the sport is a wonderful way to relieve stress.
The concentration required to outmaneuver a probing, thrusting
rapier, and the physical stamina required to endure a half-hour of
lunging and side-stepping in a thick suit, makes it impossible to
think about anything else.
</P>
<P>
   For children, fencing can help develop hand-eye coordination and
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Even as fencers unleash aggression on their opponents, there is
little chance of injury. The tips of the weapons are dulled, and
the uniforms are made with thick materials that withstand
punctures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrific sport for a lifetime,'' said Carl Borack, who
retired two years ago as the longtime captain of the U.S. Olympic
Fencing Team. ``At 24 you might be aggressive; at 54 you may be a
very calculating son of a gun who outsmarts his opponents.''

`REAL FULL MONTY': TACKY? IT BEATS PIPE FITTING, MATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(nk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you enjoyed the movie, you might get a kick out of what
purports to be ``The Real Full Monty.'' Well, not 100 percent real,
since Tuesday night's ``Inside Story'' report on A&AMP;E doesn't come
through with full frontal nudity. But if you're willing to settle
for active buttocks, the display may serve.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC camera accompanies Centaur, an all-male troupe of four
or five strapping strippers on a tour of ladies' nights at
workingmen's clubs in the English Midlands. We meet Richard, the
group's impresario, and Jeff, Barry, Doc and Dale, and catch
glimpses of their act, which Richard concedes is flat-out ``seedy
and tacky.'' The prancing, grinding and other exertions will win no
awards for stagecraft, but maybe that's not the point.
</P>
<P>
   The Centaur audience is divided over whether the show is just
nasty, especially when volunteers serve as onstage props for
fondling, nuzzling and this and that, or good unclean fun. But the
shrieks suggest that the fastidious are in the minority. Richard
reports that when the lads stopped taking off their G-strings,
interest flagged.
</P>
<P>
   The main consideration for these sturdily built lads is that
this line of work is more profitable than other employment
opportunities. As one says, it's a lot more enjoyable than pipe
fitting. Moreover, Barry notes there are perks in the form of
audience interaction. Not only are the men the beneficiaries of
kisses and cuddles during the show, but Barry confesses to being
available for private showings.
</P>
<P>
   The performers' wives, insofar as I could understand the
north-country accents, seem wishful about what their men are up to
away from home and aren't about to inquire too closely. ``Hopefully
he doesn't do anything,'' one says. But resistance may be
difficult. One performer reports that while dancing with audience
members, ``all of a sudden, you find two hands in your pants.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the shows humiliating for women? Are they humiliating for
men? Who is exploiting whom? This entertaining hour does not go in
for heavy moralizing, but it would not be the first time that the
pleasures and rewards of the marketplace were deemed to be worth a
touch of humiliation for everybody involved.

SHANNEN DOHERTY CAST AS A GOOD WITCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Shannen Doherty is working for Aaron Spelling
again, and get this _ he cast her as a witch.
</P>
<P>
   But before you spit out any jokes about the former ``Beverly
Hills, 90210'' bad girl playing a part many might claim is not much
of a stretch, Doherty will play a good witch.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Spelling said, the role of Prue Halliwell was written
well before Doherty signed on to play it.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty, Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano play three sisters
who use their mystical powers (Doherty can move objects without
touching them) to fight evil in ``Charmed,'' a new drama series
aimed at the 18-to-34-year-old crowd and set to debut 9 p.m. Oct. 7
on the WB network.
</P>
<P>
   The principals shared a stage and kudos recently to promote the
show, which would lead to the notion that the behind-the-scenes
tension marking Doherty's ``90210'' run are a thing of her past.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pairing of Spelling, the executive producer of
``Charmed,'' and Doherty, who played Brenda Walsh for the first
four years of ``90210,'' would, on the surface, seem unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of Doherty becoming increasingly difficult to work with,
coupled with legal run-ins on Sunset Strip, being sued by an
ex-landlord and a failed shotgun marriage to Ashley Hamilton
coincided with her departure from the Spelling production. However,
Spelling said that Doherty was not fired, but left of her own
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Her character eventually was written out of the teen drama.
Spelling attributed Doherty's exit to the fact the show was only
guaranteed one more season and the actress wanted to pursue other
career options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that we've always had a very good relationship,'' said
Doherty, now 27, ``and I'm thrilled that we can work together
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Spelling prefers to remember Doherty as his daughter Tori's
friend, rather than as the woman who agreed to undergo anger
management counseling and two years' probation for breaking a beer
bottle over a car in 1997. In 1994, she was sued by her landlord,
who alleged that she did $136,000 worth of damage and failed to pay
$14,000 in rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Shannen when she and Tori were little girls and she
would sleep over all the time,'' Spelling said. ``They would come
running downstairs in their jammies and raid the refrigerator.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty would prefer to remember nothing of the turbulent time,
claiming not to have any recollection of what was written about her
in the tabloids, other than that the newspapers wouldn't let it go
and the media still insists on referring to her with a word that
rhymes with witch.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty, who has been acting since age 10 and played Jenny
Wilder in ``Little House: A New Beginning,'' has appeared in
everything from the series ``Our House'' to the feature film ``Mall
Rats'' and television movies such as ``A Burning Passion: The
Margaret Mitchell Story.''
</P>
<P>
   To her, the turbulent times earlier this decade are but a blip
on life's radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of that happened eight years ago, and it seems like 30
years ago,'' Doherty said. ``I don't remember anything. I don't
remember what was said. It's over and it's done with.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Doherty's profile is much lower. She lives in
Hollywood with her longtime fiance, and has managed to steer clear
of tabloid reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Spelling, though, recalls many of the things Doherty claims to
have forgotten, including one of the more sensationalized tabloid
tales. One mag reported that Doherty ran out of a nightclub
screaming, hopped into her car and drove away without tipping the
valet attendant.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter was in the club with her that night,'' Spelling
said. ``She had gotten into a horrible fight with her boyfriend _
and they criticize her for not taking a dollar out to give to the
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if skipping tipping were a heinous act, which Spelling
obviously doesn't believe, he has no problem being in business with
Doherty. There was scuttlebutt that he offered her $1 million an
episode to return to ``90210.''
</P>
<P>
   That, he says, is not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't even offer my wife $1 million to come home,'' he
said. ``I gave her a choice of another show and this show. And we
thought it would be more fun for her to do something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Spelling sees a double standard in Hollywood that examines women
under a higher-powered microscope more than men. Second chances
often are afforded to male actors. Robert Downey Jr., who was
convicted of parole violation after breaking into and passing out
in a neighbor's home, had been released from jail to work on films,
and is now being allowed to continue a drug treatment program on an
outpatient basis _ although a judge warned him just last week that
another slip will result in prison time.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Slater is still in the business after serving time for
battering his girlfriend during a drug binge.
</P>
<P>
   Their female counterparts also should be given a chance to
redeem themselves, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish women could be treated in this industry like
men,'' Spelling said. ``The thing that bothers me is there are some
male actors who have been in drug rehab, and they don't go to drug
rehab and they're sent to jail, and sometimes they get out of jail
to finish shooting a movie _ that's OK. But with women, what is
there? A different set of rules that Shannen's going to be living
with the rest of her life? She deserves a second chance, and I gave
it to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Spelling adds, what his actors do when they're off the
clock is their own business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have an argument with my wife, does that mean I hate my
wife?'' he asked. ``I just thought (Shannen) needed better press
people to combat it. She was 22 years old. You can't criticize what
a person does on their day off.''
</P>
<P>
   The reunion of the executive producer and female lead of
``90210,'' the show that catapulted Spelling back to the top
echelon of producers and made Doherty a megastar, now makes the
return of Brenda Walsh to the Hills a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Luke Perry agreed to return to ``90210,'' after that
seemed as likely as Bob Dole becoming president of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it's an interesting thing,'' Perry said about the
chances of him and Doherty returning to the Hills at the same time.
``The great thing about Aaron is that he is a relationship-driven
person, and he puts a lot of himself in his relationships. Some
people, yes, you work for one time and leave and they want nothing
to do with you. Aaron has been around a long time and has a lot of
wisdom and is in it for the long haul. I told him I was in it for
the long haul. The thing is you can't be a (jerk) on the way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe ``Charmed'' will be such a big hit, Doherty will be too
busy to come back to ``90210'' at all. Or maybe she'll come back
for the 250th episode, which will air this season. Maybe she'll
come back for the series finale, whenever that may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I've honestly thought about it,'' Doherty said,
``and the only reason why I would contemplate it is because I get a
ton of mail from fans who would love to see it sort of resolved and
give them closure. And you know, if the right thing came along and
the two of us sort of had the scheduling right, it's not something
that I would say `absolutely no' to.''

`GAIN': COMPANY TOWN'S PROSPERITY AND PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Gain,'' his ambitious but flawed new book, Richard Powers
takes on the same large themes that animated his highly acclaimed
debut novel, ``Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance'' (1985): the
impact of history on individual lives and the collision of huge,
public enterprises with private fears and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   In this case the public enterprise is a sprawling American
conglomerate named Clare Inc., which manufactures everything from
soap to cosmetics to fertilizers; the individual is one Laura
Bodey, a small-town real-estate broker and divorced mother of two.
</P>
<P>
   The most accessible and straightforward of Powers' novels thus
far, ``Gain'' lacks the cerebral razzle-dazzle and eccentric
free-associative riffs that have distinguished his earlier work.
</P>
<P>
   Its narrative does not spin off dozens of complex ideas about
time and art and technology, but instead pivots around one simple
idea: namely, that there are limits to the growth and profit that
American business is obsessed with, that there are unreckoned
consequences to our messianic faith in progress.
</P>
<P>
   As he has done so frequently in the past, Powers tells his story
by cross-cutting cinematically between two separate narratives.
</P>
<P>
   The first chronicles the birth and spectacular growth of the
Clare company, which began as a small, family-run business and
eventually grew into a gigantic corporation that sells its products
in 83 countries to half a billion consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The second chronicles Laura Bodey's harrowing battle with
ovarian cancer _ cancer that has apparently been caused by exposure
to chemical wastes produced by Clare's giant factories.
</P>
<P>
   Laura's story, by far the more compelling of Powers' two
narratives, shows off his eye for the absurdities of modern
American life and his uncanny ear for the disjunctions of
contemporary speech.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed his portrait of the world Laura and her children inhabit
is indebted, in many ways, to the portrait Don DeLillo created in
``White Noise'' of another small Midwestern town trying to come to
terms with the fallout of an industrial accident.
</P>
<P>
   Once again we are given a glimpse of a community reeling from
information overload and consumer lust; once again we see this
world through the prism of a wryly ironic sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional town where Laura lives _ Lacewood, Ill. _ has come
of age in the shadow of Clare Inc. Three out of five workers in the
county are employed by Clare, and the town attributes its
prosperity to the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Clare, the town would have dozed forever,'' Powers
writes. ``It would have stayed a backwoods wasteland until the age
of retrotourism.'' As it is, the town is booming: Even the local
farmers wear ``clip-on cellular modems so they can receive
commodities reports while out hoeing the north 40.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Laura does not work for Clare, she realizes that the
company has insidiously permeated her daily life: Its products
``paper her cabinets. They perch on her microwave, camp out on her
stove, hang from her shower head. Clare hiding under the sink,
swarming her medicine chest, lining the shelves in the basement,
parked out in the garage, piled up in the shed.''
</P>
<P>
   As Laura discovers that she is suffering from cancer and begins
several long, painful bouts of chemotherapy and radiation, Powers
exchanges his sardonic humor for a more empathetic voice, a voice
capable of rendering her ordeal with unsentimental compassion.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the passages in ``Gain'' devoted to Laura's battle with
cancer emerge as the most emotionally affecting work Powers has
done to date. He not only makes us understand her determination to
live and her simultaneous urge to submit to the pain, but he also
conveys the subtle, surprising ways in which the illness alters her
relationships with her children and ex-husband.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the reader, Laura's story is broken up by
long, tedious sections detailing the history of Clare Inc.
</P>
<P>
   We learn how the company was founded by a merchant family named
Clare that stumbled across a gifted candle maker and turned his
craft into a thriving cottage industry. We watch as this
mom-and-pop operation slowly grows into a profitable business, and
how this business in turn becomes a national corporation and later
an international consortium.
</P>
<P>
   We see the company pass out of the hands of the Clare family and
diversify from candles and soaps into detergents, pesticides,
makeup and bathroom cleansers _ basically whatever consumers want.
</P>
<P>
   Although the early chapters of the company's history are
enlivened by colorful portraits of members of the Clare family _
Samuel Clare, who sees the company as a divinely blessed
enterprise; Ben Clare, who dreams of doing pure scientific research
_ things slow down considerably as the business is taken over by
pallid, money-grubbing managers and bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   The reader becomes numbed by Powers' repetitious recitations of
the company's ups and downs and of how the firm was affected by
historical events like the Civil War, Emancipation and the two
World Wars.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The lessons Clare Inc. would like its customers to take from its
history are familiar ones: Nothing succeeds like success; what's
good for Clare is good for America; cleanliness is next to
godliness.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``Gain'' so disappointing in the end is that the
lessons Powers wants his readers to draw from his novel are
similarly predictable: that greed isn't good, that marketing has
become an American way of life, that there are incalculable costs
to progress.
</P>
<P>
   For an intelligent and cerebral writer like Powers, these are
fairly obvious points. Certainly they are not points that need to
be made over and over and over again, throughout a 350-page novel _
a novel that, for all its affecting moments, is ultimately dragged
down by its simplistic message.

   Pete Townshend will be there, as will Richie Havens, Stevie
Nicks and the band Ten Years After. And the site, as usual, is Max
Yasgur's farm in Bethel, N.Y. But beyond that, very little of this
year's version of Woodstock will resemble the original. Called ``A
Day in the Garden,'' the concert is scheduled to run from Friday
through Sunday and is heavy on performers who weren't even born
when some 300,000 revelers first descended on the site in 1969,
like the Goo Goo Dolls and Third Eye Blind.
</P>
<P>
   The event is also heavy on rules: no camping, no bikes and no
outside food or beverages, although cellular phones will be
allowed. Organized by Alan Gerry, a cable television executive, the
concert may have one authentic 1960s element: dissent. A local
group, the Woodstock Nation Foundation, is threatening to protest
over organizers' plans to bar unticketed crowds from the site.

   The Stratford Festival, the esteemed Ontario-based classical
theater company, will bring two productions to New York in November
as part of a new partnership with City Center, Judith Daykin, the
center's president and executive director, has announced. The
partnership's two-week inaugural run will kick off on Nov. 12 with
``Much Ado About Nothing,'' with Brian Bedford, Martha Henry and
William Hutt, and continue with a production of Moliere's ``Miser''
in repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Both shows will be directed by Richard Monette, the artistic
director of the 44-year-old company. City Center's 1998-99 season
will also include engagements by the San Francisco Ballet, American
Ballet Theater and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.

Uncle Gaybo by his fans, has both a top-rated radio show and a
weekly television program, the ``Late Late Show,'' which he has
presided over for 36 years.
</P>
<P>
   He told Agence France-Presse that he planned to step down from
the radio program at Christmas and end his television show next
June. ``I want to try and see what might happen doing absolutely
nothing for a short period of time,'' he said. ``Then see what

Army-Navy stores for less than $30 to women's suede versions by
Ralph Lauren for a whopping $2,295.

SELLING A TO Z ON THE WEB VIA `AFFILIATE NETWORKS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By EVAN I. SCHWARTZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are akin to franchising without the franchises. Or, in
worst cases, a pyramid scheme without the pyramid. But ``affiliate
networks'' is what the electronic commerce industry calls them, and
they are a World Wide Web company's way to get other people to do
its marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable example of an affiliate network is probably the
Amazon.com Associates Program, which recently signed up its
100,000th affiliated Web site. Each affiliate earns commissions of
up to 15 percent on sales of books and audio CD's _ just for
enticing online shoppers to click over to Amazon.com's online
superstore and buy something.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Amazon.com's affiliate network, despite being the first and
largest, is by no means unique. Hundreds have been cropping up all
over the Web, in almost every conceivable product category, from
artwork to Zambonis. And even as some analysts wonder whether the
proliferation of links will dilute the potency of the idea, many
Web entrepreneurs see it as the perfect way to capitalize on the
medium's networking and linking capabilities _ to turn the
time-honored business tradition of word-of-mouth referrals into a
new, word-of-mouse era.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as the future,'' said Phillip Rose, managing
director of the Lobster Net, a Web venture based in Beverly, Mass.,
that offers quick delivery of live Maine lobsters packed in
Styrofoam, wet newspapers and seaweed to customers around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Rose has recruited hundreds of Web sites into his
revenue-sharing program. In return for including an ad banner on
its site that links to thelobsternet.com, an affiliate earns a 5
percent commission for each referred customer who orders a lobster.
</P>
<P>
   Though such click-through sales now account for perhaps 4 of his
40 or so daily shipments, Rose expects his affiliated sites to
eventually drive the majority of sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``To survive on the Internet, we have to make our affiliates as
productive as possible,'' he said. ``It's a numbers game, and 1,000
is better than 1.''
</P>
<P>
   A main goal for affiliate programs is to lure first-time
cybershoppers: consumers who might not otherwise seek or find their
way to a retail site. For the retailers, there are no initial costs
to setting up an affiliate network, except for any phone calls and
employee hours to recruit a base of partners. For the thousands of
affiliates, whether commercial sites or amateur, there seems to be
nothing to lose. Since there are no joining fees, the only cost is
maintaining banner ads and product information on their own sites.
</P>
<P>
   But is this a good idea growing out of control? Every day, an
average of 10 affiliate programs apply for a listing on
Refer-It.com, an online directory of about 400 such programs, which
makes its money from the affiliate networks and software providers
that sponsor the site.
</P>
<P>
   James Marciano, chief executive of the service, based in New
York, says he typically lists half of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turn down a lot of stuff that's really schlocky,'' Mr.
Marciano said. ``We look for companies that are established and
selling their own products.''
</P>
<P>
   The kinds of applicants he tends to reject are ones with the
potential to turn into pyramid schemes. The National Consumers
League defines a pyramid as a marketing operation in which any
profits are from recruiting others, not from actual sales of goods
or services _ schemes that often wind up being prosecuted for
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But even the activity generated by legitimate affiliate networks
has led to a free-for-all atmosphere, in which greater numbers of
Web sites that sell something are recruiting even greater numbers
of affiliates, which range from lone college students to well-known
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   In more traditional businesses, a manufacturing company or a
retail chain sells lucrative franchises that cover exclusive rights
to a specific sales territory. On the Web, such geographic
exclusivity is not possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tried to locate a new Saturn dealer a half-mile away
from an existing one, they'd both freak,'' Marciano said. ``But on
the Web, you can't stake out territories.''
</P>
<P>
   So, rather than allowing a select few to act as their authorized
agents, the operators of affiliate networks seem to be operating
under a philosophy of ``he with the largest horde wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Online music retailers, for instance, are scrambling to amass as
many affiliates as possible. CD Now, based in Jenkintown, Pa.,
already has more than 11,000 partners in its Cosmic Credit Program.
The Music Boulevard site of N2K, based in New York, has 7,000
members in its affiliate program. And CD referral sites are a
primary reason that Amazon.com has seen membership in its
two-year-old affiliate program triple since the company began
selling CD's last spring.
</P>
<P>
   All told, affiliate programs will directly account for 11
percent of the $5.8 billion of consumer transactions over the Web
this year, says Nicole Vanderbilt, an analyst with Jupiter
Communications, based in New York. Ms. Vanderbilt projects that the
figure will grow to 24 percent of $37.5 billion in total sales by
2002.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers do not include business-to-business transactions
on the Web, but they do include special revenue-sharing deals
between so-called portals like AOL.com and Web-commerce sites like
Music Boulevard. As with the affiliate relationships, those deals
usually work on a commission-only basis, although they often
involve higher commission rates.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, that higher commission is based on the realization
that these more formal referral relationships result in a higher,
steadier volume of paying customers. After all, even Amazon.com,
the most prolific recruiter of ad hoc affiliates, still counts on
big-fish partners like Yahoo for a large proportion of referred
sales.
</P>
<P>
   There are drawbacks to relying too heavily on affiliate
networks. A growing number of the affiliates themselves, for
example, are finding that if they click through their own sites to
shop at, say, Amazon.com, they can earn a commission on their own
purchases. So in addition to the discount off hardcover prices
(perhaps 40 percent) that Amazon.com gives any customer,an
affiliate could get 15 percent in commission.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic subverts the program's original intent: to land new
customers. Shawn Haynes, who runs the Amazon.com Associates
Program,says that such abuses violate the associates' agreement and
that he has removed some members caught in them. But Haynes
acknowledges that Amazon.com cannot police every purchase.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as the business world continues to discover ways to put
the Web's considerable networking and data-sifting powers to use,
affiliate networks have emerged as a powerful new tool that seems
likely to endure in one form or another.
</P>
<P>
   At Amazon.com, which lists about three million book titles,
Haynes said the company could rely on an almost endless variety of
niche affiliates to highlight much smaller portions of its list for
specific target audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``This extends our editorial expertise into unique areas and
spheres of influence,'' he said, ``from personal finance to poetry
to fly-fishing to kayaking.''

'41 BEST SELLER IS BACK AND CLAWING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never mind what makes Sammy run. What makes Sammy sell?
</P>
<P>
   Reports of a movie deal, that's what.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-seven years after Budd Schulberg's corrosive Hollywood
novel ``What Makes Sammy Run?'' became a runaway best seller, the
story of the back-stabbing newspaper copy boy who claws his way to
mogulhood turned up once again on a best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   It popped up unexpectedly as No. 8 on the Los Angeles Times Book
Review paperback nonfiction list for one week last month.
</P>
<P>
   That was a mistake, Steve Wasserman, the paper's book editor,
said later. It should have been listed in the fiction column.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what was a 1941 book doing on any best-seller list in
1998?
</P>
<P>
   The publisher, Vintage Books, which re-issued the novel in 1990
in time for its 50th anniversary, had no ready explanation. A
spokeswoman for Vintage, a division of Random House, said the book
had been selling steadily at about 1,000 copies a year.
</P>
<P>
   Schulberg, who was ostracized in Hollywood after ``What Makes
Sammy Run?'' came out but who later wrote the Oscar-winning
screenplay for the 1954 film ``On the Waterfront,'' also confessed
surprise upon being told of the sudden new popularity of his
archetypal villain. But from his home in the Hamptons, the
84-year-old author and veteran screenwriter supplied a clue:
``There's been a good deal of print about a film,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been talking to Ben Stiller,'' he said. ``He wants to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiller, the comic, actor and director, and son of comedians
Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, is the co-writer of an adaptation of
the book and has said he would like to direct it.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, after being briefed on yet another meeting at Warner
Brothers, Schulberg reported, ``It's pretty close, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be the first dramatization: a television version of
the book was broadcast in two parts by NBC in 1960 and a musical
version with Steve Lawrence ran on Broadway for 540 performances in
1964 and 1965. But a full screen treatment of ``What Makes Sammy
Run?'' more than half a century after the furor would be of more
than passing interest in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   A leading Hollywood bookstore, Book Soup on Sunset Boulevard,
said it had seen a recent spike in sales of the book. Many of the
more than 100 copies sold so far this year went in recent weeks,
said Tosh Berman, a clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Blurb-wise, the re-issued Vintage paperback is hard to beat: ``
`A grand book, utterly fearless and with a great deal of beauty
side by side with the most bitter satire' _ F. Scott Fitzgerald.''
Even more impressive, considering Fitzgerald died the year before
the book was published. The two worked together in Hollywood. ``He
read it in manuscript,'' Schulberg recalled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A run on books tied to movies is a familiar pattern, Berman of
Book Soup said. Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 movie ``Bram Stoker's
Dracula'' stirred great reader interest in the classic original. So
did ``Last Exit to Brooklyn,'' the 1964 novel by Hubert Selby Jr.
that was made into a movie in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But people who see the movie and then want to read the book are
one thing. These movies are not out yet.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Berman said, the store quickly sold three dozen copies
of ``American Psycho'' by Bret Easton Ellis, undoubtedly on reports
that the controversially brutal novel may be heading for the screen
with Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Berman said, his customers are actors looking for a role,
or screenwriters and production assistants.
</P>
<P>
   But is that enough to make a best seller? Perhaps in Hollywood,
where reading is often confined to ``covers'' _ studio synopses of
books rather than the books themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, said a publishing executive who spoke on
condition of anonymity, ``20 people buying a book can propel it
on.''
</P>
<P>
   However it happened, Schulberg is hardly quibbling, especially
after the ostracism he suffered in the succes de scandale of ``What
Makes Sammy Run?'' when Hollywood obsessed over identifying the
real Sammy and cries of anti-Semitism were hurled at his Jewish
creator. Schulberg, who always said Sammy was a composite
character, long ridiculed the notion that creating a Jewish
literary villain made all Jews out to be villains. Many of Sammy's
victims were Jews too, he said, and Sammy Glicks came in all
religions and ethnicities.
</P>
<P>
   But you couldn't tell that to the movie industry in 1941.
``You'll never work in this town again,'' his father B.P.
Schulberg, once head of Paramount, wrote him sadly. ``How will you
live?''
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper accosted him in a
restaurant, huffing: ``How dare you?'' And, Schulberg recounted,
his own dear ``Uncle Louie,'' Hollywood's boss of bosses Louis
Mayer, demanded his deportation. His father stood up for him.
``He's the only novelist who ever came from Hollywood,'' his father
said. ``Where do you think his St. Helena should be? Catalina
Island?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schulberg said, he was hounded out of Hollywood. He
resettled in Hanover, N.H., where he had written ``Sammy.''
</P>
<P>
   He later became immersed in new controversy when he appeared
before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, supplying
names for the panel's investigation of communists in the movie
industry. Schulberg made ``On the Waterfront'' in Hoboken, N.J.,
and did not return to Hollywood until the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   As happy as he is over the durability of his book, he is
troubled by what he called, in an afterward to the 1991 re-issue,
``a disturbing shift in what was to become a 180-degree turn in our
national attitude toward Sammy.''
</P>
<P>
   He had given a talk at Hofstra University, he said, when a young
man came up to thank him for creating Sammy Glick and said: ``He's
a great character. I love him. I felt a little nervous about going
out into the world and making it. But reading `Sammy' gives me
confidence. It's my Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, Schulberg said, he couldn't bring himself to shake
hands.

PHYSICIAN THROWS A DIFFERENT LIGHT ON CHAPTERS OF ENGLISH HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is undisputed that the British monarchy saw its power decline
in the 17th century. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Historians generally have attributed this loss to a natural
evolution, partly economic, partly religious. People and Parliament
just gained more and more power as the country developed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Holmes, a physician turned historian, has a different
idea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory was that Parliament got power and the monarchs lost
power because of disease and death,'' said Holmes, a professor of
medicine at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City,
Kan. ``The Stuarts (the family who reigned at the time) had a lot
of illness and a lot of limiting physical problems.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holmes' research has been received well enough that professors
at the University of Kansas are encouraging him to turn it into a
book. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought an insight that professional historians just can't
bring, because they just don't have the medical knowledge,'' said
Rose L. Greaves, professor of Middle East history at KU. ``By
looking into the medical history, he was able to bring new ideas on
how illnesses impacted the course of the dynasty.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for someone who spent 40 years as a doctor of internal
medicine before turning to history five years ago at age 60. He
graduated with his master's degree in May. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   History has always interested Holmes. He said growing up during
World War II fed that interest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very mind-expanding time, because the entire world
was suddenly in the newspaper every day,'' he said. ``I had
numerous cousins and uncles who were in the military scattered all
over the world. I think I acquired an appreciation of the world.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s he and his wife, Grace Holmes, a pediatrician
also at KU Medical Center, became medical missionaries and traveled
to what was then Malaya and British East Africa, both of which had
just left the British Empire. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I became really interested in the history of England as a
world power and the people who made it work,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holmes has spent his career studying cancer, but he decided he
needed a new intellectual challenge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose (history) really because it wasn't related,'' he said.
``I wanted to see if I could do it.It was very difficult, and it
really stretched my mind.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At KU, Holmes studied under John Kenyon, who until his death in
1996 was one of the world's leading authorities on the Stuarts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I started looking at the medical problems of the Stuarts, and
I knew I found my niche,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   There were remarkably many Stuart rulers in a span of 111 years:
James I reigned from 1603 to 1625; Charles I from 1625 until his
beheading in 1649; Charles II from 1660 to 1685; James II from 1685
to 1688; William III and Mary II beginning in 1689; and Anne from
1702 to 1714.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many Stuart rulers in a relatively short period
because of illnesses and death, and because in that era Parliament
was able to wrest away power from the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes points to France, Spain and Austria, which did not see a
similar decrease in the power of their monarchies at that time. Nor
did they have much in the way of parliaments. Their rulers, he
said, generally were healthier and lived longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their monarchies were more stable,'' he said. ``They didn't
have trouble finding heirs, and they did not have the health
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The health of the Stuarts is not the sole reason the monarchy
lost power. Economics, religion and other issues certainly played a
hand. Their health, however, did have a major effect on the
stability of the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one important factor that no one else has brought
forward,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   Scouring medical records and other writings from the period,
Holmes has concluded:
</P>
<P>
   James I, who was unable to walk until he was 4 or 5 years old,
probably had a mild form of muscular dystrophy. He also had kidney
stones, arthritis and in later years dementia.
</P>
<P>
   The death of James' oldest son, Henry, at 18 left a major
vacancy. His death was a blow to the Stuarts because he was being
groomed to become king and it was believed he would have made a
great king.
</P>
<P>
   Charles I, who also had similar problems walking, had a mild
form of muscular dystrophy, too, and stuttered.
</P>
<P>
   Charles II, an amateur chemist with a unventilated palace
laboratory, died of acute mercury poisoning. Previously he was
thought to have died of apoplexy.
</P>
<P>
   James II had a bloody nose that occurred off and on for three
days before he lost the throne in 1688. It was commonly thought
that this prevented him from organizing his army to defend the
throne. Holmes, however, says this was a minor problem. The main
reason he was unable to defend the throne was the defection of key
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Mary, daughter of James II, was unable to produce an heir and
died of smallpox. She had two pregnancies but no live births.
</P>
<P>
   Anne, whose story Holmes said is the most tragic of all the
Stuarts, died of complications from a form of lupus, not gout as
had been thought. A convincing clue was that she was still
menstruating until her death at age 49. It is a medical fact,
Holmes said, that a woman cannot have gout until after menopause.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the library over in Lawrence, I found quite by chance a
copy of the diary of Anne's gynecologist,'' Holmes said. ``He
stated unequivocally that she had menstrual periods right up to the
end of her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, of her 17 pregnancies, only three babies were born alive.
Those three died within 10 years of their births.
</P>
<P>
   Had half of her children survived, Holmes said, there is a
chance her descendants still would be ruling today.
</P>
<P>
   It is Holmes' use of such primary sources _ what historians call
records by those who witnessed the event firsthand _ that is
winning him praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tracking down the evidence to support his thesis is the
impressive part,'' said John F. Sweets, a professor of history and
director of graduate studies at KU.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extent of the research he had done, the digging up of
clues, is what is truly impressive,'' Sweets said.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the material was not always easy, Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians have always been reluctant to write for posterity
things about their patients,'' Holmes said. ``There is something to
the idea that a person's medical records should be kept
confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, he said, not every physician believed that. Also,
autopsy reports can be found, he said. Those records were preserved
to quash rumors that monarchs had been poisoned.
</P>
<P>
   By delving into these records, Holmes said, he was able to use
modern medical knowledge to decipher what doctors then could not.
Often some of the maladies, including muscular dystrophy and lupus,
were not then identified or diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   While Holmes would like to publish a book based on his thesis,
he said he first must reorganize his thoughts into something a
publisher might consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, who cares what James I died of?'' he said. ``You
can't change it. I can't go back and make him better so that he can
live longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he sees studying the actual causes of death of historical
figures as worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can have a better understanding of history, we can have
a better understanding of why we are where we are now.''

DESPITE AUGUST RECESS, TALK OF SCANDAL KEEPS WASHINGTON BUZZING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In August, Washington usually undergoes a
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling class on Capitol Hill flees the city and fans out
across the land to take the political pulse. The president and
others in the administration escape, too. With both gone, the
engines of government slow, and Washington settles into a monthlong
political torpor.
</P>
<P>
   But not this year.
</P>
<P>
   Washington this August is anything but the sleepy town it
traditionally becomes when the powerful take a powder. Sex and
scandal don't take a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy over the president's alleged affair and cover-up has
intensified, and political Washington remains on high alert, August
recess or not. The prosecutors and the pundits are still here, and
there's no rest for the scandal-weary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is like Salem,'' said veteran Republican lobbyist
Tom Korologos. ``If we're not lynching somebody 24 hours a day,
we're not happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about the Palm, one of Washington's power restaurants,
Charles Conconi, an editor at Washingtonian Magazine and a longtime
capital observer, said: ``It was just hopping. We were all talking
about `the dress.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Not the dress former White House intern Monica Lewinsky wore to
her grand jury appearance, of course, but the one that she spirited
away to her mother's New York apartment and that has now emerged as
the most talked-about piece of evidence since the bloody glove in
the O.J. Simpson trial.
</P>
<P>
   And for some, that's reason enough to be glad to be out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, expressed his disbelief
about the current political events when he recently spoke with Tom
Ridge, governor of Pennsylvania and McCain's former congressional
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `When you and I came into the House, if you had said
we're going to be dealing with this kind of stuff, you'd have both
of us saying we were crazy.' The whole thing is bizarre,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving town, however, leaves a political vacuum. With
politicians spread across the country, it's difficult to coordinate
a message when developments happen on the scandal front _ and this
could be particularly harmful to Republicans, who have had a hard
time sticking with a coherent message.
</P>
<P>
   Korologos said he was only half-joking when, on the eve of
Congress' recess, he told a group of Republican senators: ``For
heaven's sake. Leave somebody behind. Don't ever leave this town
alone. We'll get killed from the media juggernaut in the White
House. They are the best I've ever seen in 37 years in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   What members of Congress find back home could be instructive to
what they do with independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report on
four years of investigations when it lands in their lap as early as
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Polls, however, show the country is nowhere near as spellbound
by all this as Washington is. The public may be more inclined to
share the view of Anne M. Burford, a former Reagan administration
official enmeshed in a scandal back then, who once described the
capital as ``too small to be a state, but too large to be an asylum
for the mentally deranged.''
</P>
<P>
   The past week did have an air of unreality. There was Lewinsky,
heading into the grand jury to possibly say the very words that
could topple the president. There was the president, the Marine
Band playing ``Stars and Stripes Forever,'' going about his
business, just like a normal day in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like you have water-cooler discussions in the White
House about this,'' one presidential aide said about the scandal.
``The president himself is focused, and we're just following his
example.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress used to meet only about half the year, up until the
1930s. In a crisis the president might call the members back and
they'd take up the rugs, open the windows and try to be comfortable
amid the sweltering heat. It wasn't until the 1970s that Congress
passed a law to make the August recess official.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Senate Watergate committee, which held hearings
throughout the summer of 1973, took August off. Still, President
Nixon resigned the following August.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, said Donald Ritchie, a Senate historian,
``probably the only major event that took place in Washington in
August was when British troops invaded in August 1814 and burned
the Capitol and the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   And Congress was out of town then, too, he added.

   The conventional wisdom is the farther north you go in Florida,
the more Southern you'll hear spoken.
</P>
<P>
   While this is basically true, there is no clear-cut boundary
between Southern-speak and whatever discordant babble everyone else
speaks. For this reason, newcomers to this area may have trouble,
at first, deciphering our particular brand of English, though, over
time, they will surely come to appreciate its elegance and
simplicity.

team and famous for its crabcakes. Usage: ``Some folks from Balmer
thinks they's Southern, but ah personally thinks they ain't.''
</P>
<P>
   Cent. Plural of cent. Usage: ``You paid five dollars for that
necktie? Ah wouldn't give fiddy cent for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheer. An adverb meaning in or at this place. Usage: ``War's the
pickup truck? Rat cheer.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinics. A brand-name paper tissue. Usage: ``I'd best git me a

<P>
   Patricia Wright's trail to Madagascar and environmental heroism
began with an act that is now considered the antithesis of
conservation: the purchase in a Brooklyn pet store of an owl
monkey, and then a second one to keep it company. Within a week of
the birth of her own daughter, Amanda, the monkeys too produced a
Brooklyn baby, and the mother/housewife became increasingly
intrigued by the behavior of these nocturnal monkeys. The female
monkey's only responsibility appeared to be breast-feeding. The
male did all the parenting, carrying and caring for the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Wright, who had loved the woods growing up in upstate New
York and had a college degree in biology, decided she wanted to
study these monkeys in the wild. Books in the New York Public
Library told her that the ``wild'' meant the jungles of Peru, home
to wild boar, jaguars and deadly fer-de-lance snakes. She consulted
Warren Kinzey, then an anthropologist at City University of New
York, pumping him for guidance on how to do field research.
</P>
<P>
   Kinzey told her, in effect, that unless she earned a graduate
degree and acquired a university affiliation, no one would give her
the money she would need. But she was undeterred. Through a friend
who knew a dean at the New School for Social Research, she wangled
an affiliation with the school and persuaded Nancy Mulligan, a
wealthy widow interested in wildlife who lived in Rochester, N.Y.,
near Ms. Wright's hometown of Avon, to underwrite the expedition
for herself, her husband, their 3-year-old daughter and a native
guide.
</P>
<P>
   Her library research had led her to a site that turned out to
have long since been converted from jungle to coffee plantations.
No monkey had been seen there for 25 years. The next stop was a
six-day canoe ride into the jungle, family in tow. Her guide soon
got bored looking for monkeys in the dark, so one night Pat Wright
ventured alone into the jungle. Frightened by what sounded like
wild boar and with her flashlight growing dim, she spent the night
in a spiny tree, only to be scolded by none other than two owl
monkeys whose territory she had invaded.
</P>
<P>
   They were the first of many for Pat Wright. Six months later,
she returned to Brooklyn with notebooks filled with observations of
the monkeys, the first data ever gathered on nocturnal monkeys in
the wild. Kinzey was more than a little impressed.
</P>
<P>
   At his urging, she enrolled in graduate school at the City
University in 1977. Nine years later, including time out for child
care, a divorce and another 14-month trip to the Amazon, she
received her degree.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was off to Madagascar, known for its rare species and
especially lemurs. Armed with a grant from the World Wildlife Fund,
Ms. Wright hoped to find the ``probably extinct'' greater bamboo
lemur. Madagascar, a poor island country east of Kenya, had
physically split from the African mainland about 150 million years
ago, subsequently becoming a Darwinian laboratory of isolated
evolution. The ever-shrinking Malagasy jungles harbor thousands of
species of plants and animals known nowhere else on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of Madagascar's wildlife is unique to the island,
including nearly all of its mammals, 90 percent of its reptiles and
amphibians, 80 percent of its plants and half of its birds. The
rosy periwinkle that is the source of the life-saving leukemia drug
vincristine is one of 8,000 plants that are native to Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
   But all of this bounty was imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flying over the island,'' she recalled, ``all I saw was
devastation,'' the result of decades of slash-and-burn farming.
</P>
<P>
   En route to establishing that the greater bamboo lemur, a little
primate with big, watchful eyes and charcoal-grey fur, was indeed
alive and doing better than expected in the remaining Malagasy rain
forest, Ms. Wright discovered an entirely new species of lemur with
golden red fur, the golden bamboo lemur, which thrives on the
cyanide-laced shoots of young bamboo, though how this
three-and-a-half-pound primate tolerates an amount of poison that
could kill a man is still anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no sooner had I found this new species than I heard
farmers sawing down 200-year-old rosewood trees, each of which
takes about nine smaller trees with it,'' Ms. Wright recalled
recently. An appeal to the Ministry of Water and Forest to protect
the forest ended with a challenge to Ms. Wright to help establish a
national park.
</P>
<P>
   She explained that the repeated inroads into the Malagasy rain
forests were nothing more than Band-Aids for the farmers living in
one of the ten poorest countries in the world. After only two years
of farming on newly cleared land, the soil would be depleted,
forcing them to cut down yet more forest. Meanwhile, the runoff of
ochre-tinted soil ruined waterways and the loss of trees threatened
the watershed. And since few Malagasy were aware of the economic
potential of ecotourism, the farmers gave little thought to the
fast-disappearing habitats of Madagascar's unique flora and fauna,
which include 32 species of lemurs (16 of the largest ones have
already become extinct).
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ms. Wright arrived there in 1985, more than 80
percent of the forests had disappeared from this Indian Ocean
island and there were only two national parks in Madagascar, the
last one established in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   It took her five years to create the new park, five years of
days-long treks to visit with surrounding farmers and explain the
purpose of the park and its potential value to their families and
future, five years of negotiations with village elders and
government officials, five years of international phone calls and
grant proposals to raise the millions of dollars needed, not just
to create the park but to give the villagers something in return
for the land they would sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, with the help of $6.27 million from the U.S. Agency
for International Development and the support of various
conservation groups, there was not only a 108,000-acre park but
eight new schools, 10 renovated schools, four health-care
facilities, a team of visiting doctors and nurses, rural libraries
with books on conservation and 133 villagers working in the park.
In addition, the villagers receive half the entrance fees to the
park, now visited by 10,000 tourists a year.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Note to political hopefuls: Get off our backs
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The horror stories are in. Our country is
awash in lousy teachers locked into lucrative positions by tenure.
</P>
<P>
   A typing teacher in Florida goes bonkers with her kids and joins
in when the class begins throwing books and dismantling
typewriters. It took a year to fire her. In the meantime, she wrote
a rambling defense of her actions and changed her surname to God.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, so Ms. God's behavior was a little odd and nobody was
learning to type. Bad teachers happen, but so do bad firemen, bad
investment brokers, and bad paper hangers. Even bad pilots happen
but they have a way of weeding themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   Good teachers don't like bad teachers because their iniquities
smudge all of our reputations, and even though most of us have
never engaged in a book flinging session (not that we haven't
considered it once or twice) or helped our students cheat on state
exams (as did a teacher in Connecticut), we suffer by comparison.
Bad teachers short change
</P>
<P>
   everyone: kids, parents, entire communities.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers try not to judge each other's methods because we know
they're as varied as the personalities involved. And they should
be. My classroom approach wouldn't work for the math teacher and
his would be useless in a creative writing setting.
</P>
<P>
   A teacher's most valuable classroom asset is honesty because
kids can sniff out a faker a mile away. ``Whatever you do,'' I
remember one of my methods teachers at the university warning us,
``don't let your students see you angry.'' My younger classmates
bought into that but not I.
</P>
<P>
   I had lived 30-some years longer than anybody in there,
including the professor, and had raised a son. I knew better. Anger
happens. Ticked-off happens. And when it does, I generously share
it with my studets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow!'' I overheard an eighth-grader warning another between
classes. ``Ms. Schuett lost it all over Freddy last period. Man,
don't even think of coming to class without your rewrite.'' Mission
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I hadn't tried the psychological bull with Freddy,
appealing to his higher aspirations only to discover he had none.
His sole academic aim is to graduate before he outgrows his desk.
Once I reminded him of how good he'd feel if his homework were
finished BEFORE he sat down to watch TV. He said he wouldn't feel
good at all if he wasted all of that time on school work. Said he'd
miss the Montel show. I assured him that would indeed be a tragic
loss and immediately launched into a non-traditional disciplinary
approach. I yelled at Freddy. He caught on and delivered the
rewrite and it didn't bother me one little bit that his only
motivation to write was to shut me up.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers don't ask for a whole lot - a little respect, some new
textbooks from time to time, and once in a while, a raise would be
nice. Most of us aren't militant and know little of the function of
much maligned teacher's unions. Many of us belong for the legal
protection they provide, like in case twenty years down the line
Freddy's mom decides to sue me because Freddy lost out on his bid
for the Pulitzer.
</P>
<P>
   But you know what we'd like most of all? We'd like for ambitious
politicians to stop using teachers and education as political
footballs.
</P>
<P>
   It's no game folks!
</P>

   BELLSOUTH-STRIKE _ Following developments in the wake of the
last-minute strike settlement by CWA and BellSouth. (Kanell,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA: 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   TOUGH-UNIONS _ ATLANTA _ Corporate America, get ready to rumble.
More confrontations between management and workers are likely if
the economy remains healthy and worker shortages continue. The
nation's prosperity and record corporate profits are producing
gutsier workers. (Joyner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WALLSTREET-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ The way for investors to get
through the kind of stock market we've had in the last month is to
know why they're investing and to have enough self-discipline to
stay the course. (Walker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   GEEWAX-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Eventually, the kids will move away,
the mortgage will get paid off and deceased parents will leave
behind an inheritance. That patrimony may be considerable:
Economists estimate $12 trillion is now in the hands of the fading
World War II generation whose heirs are the 76 million Americans
born between 1946 and 1964. (Geewax, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   GRASSROOTS-GAS _ ATLANTA _ Deregulation of Georgia's natural gas
market doesn't officially begin until Nov. 1. But don't tell that
to Dave Rich, who represents more than 7,000 Georgia consumers and
is ready to make a deal on their behalf for the best gas price once
the market is opened to competition. (Quinn, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MONEYTALK-COLUMN_ ATLANTA _ Here's an alluring idea: The next
time you need some ready cash, borrow it from yourself. As you
repay the loan, both principal and interest will go to you, not to
a lender. That may sound outlandish. But for many workers _ those
who have a 401(k). retirement plan with loan provisions _ it is an
increasingly attractive alternative. (Ezell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   INSURANCE-SHOPPING _ ATLANTA _ Georgia drivers paid an average
of $627.47 for auto insurance coverage in 1996, the latest data
available _ an average for all drivers, all cars, all locations.
But many drivers paid far more. That happened for several reasons,
including one often overlooked: They failed to shop around.
(Tharpe, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) MOVED. WITH LAYOUT AND
GRAPHICS.
</P>
<P>
   INSURANCE-PREMIUMS _ ATLANTA _ In terms of what it costs to
insure a car in Georgia, the average annual expenditure for auto
insurance was $627.47 in 1996, latest data available, the 25th
highest in the nation _ placing Georgia right in the middle of the
50 states. New Jersey has the highest average costs, $1,100. The
cheapest is Iowa at $445.39 annually. And even lower premiums are
expected, in Georgia and nationwide. (Tharpe, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.) MOVED. WITH LAYOUT AND GRAPHICS.

</P>
<P>
   MINORITY-TECH _ ATLANTA _ Bobby Smith, his son and his wife all
signed up for Derrick Brown's computer class at Georgia Tech.
``Using the computer just at work, I did not realize all the things
you can do with the Internet and in other ways that are such fun,''
Smith said. ``I am glad I did it, and now I tell everybody to try
it.'' The Smith family of Decatur, Ga. happens to be
African-American, and their experience underlines the findings in
studies that blacks are often involved less in the computer age
than the population at large. Often, however, encouragement and
opportunity can fire their enthusiasm about computers.
(Holsendolph, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-REPORT _ ATLANTA _ On portable sound systems. (Kanell,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ If you plan to put your faith _
and perhaps your fortune _ in the hands of the gurus dispensing
free legal advice on the World Wide Web, you can only hope your
next judge has a 17-inch screen. But if you use the legal resources
you find on the Web to prepare yourself for a visit with a lawyer,
it's possible to save money and do a better job of preparing for
that visit. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETWATCH-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ You've probably been hearing a lot
about portals on the Internet lately. People buying portals,
selling portals, analysts predicting portals are the future. (Katz,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ I am here today to propose a new
national holiday. I don't think it'll be as much fun as Christmas,
or as important as Mother's Day, but I'm pretty sure it will catch
on. I propose we have a National Low Tech Day. (Husted, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.) MOVED.

   FBC-SCAROLINA _ The Road to College Football previews South

the Gamecocks have only had a .500 record during his four seasons.
The bright spot for South Carolina this season is the return of

   BBN-BROWN-TRADE _ SAN DIEGO _ Kevin Brown didn't like it at
first. Not one bit. It was Dec. 15, and the Florida Marlins had
just traded Brown to the San Diego Padres for three minor-league
prospects. And the prospect of moving almost a continent away from
his Macon, Ga., home, his wife and two sons was pretty unappealing.
Well, it's eight months later, the Padres are sitting atop the

Brown himself his the proud owner of a 14-3 record and an 11-game

   NUHN-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ She hit ``rock bottom,'' as she
calls it, in October of 1996. Karen Noble had lost her playing card
after a promising start on the LPGA Tour, was back at Qualifying
School, it was Day One, and she was in the process of shooting 81.
Golf can do that to you; can grab you like a bouncer and start
tossing you around until you're bruised in both body and spirit.
Noble was to that point and beyond. (Nuhn, Dayton Daily News.)

   ARCHDEACON-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ It was a voice she never
dreamed she'd hear again. It came to Judy Dickinson Thursday by
overnight mail. The unexpected package had been sent to Dayton by a
woman in Macon, Ga. When the woman's husband had been dying of
multiple sclerosis and could no longer see, Judy's husband _
Gardner Dickinson _ wanted to do something special. He and the guy
had gone to high school together in the early 1940s. And so,
Gardner _ one of the pioneers of the PGA Tour and Senior PGA Tour _
decided to read the golf book he had written, as well as special
notes and asides, into a tape recorder. He sent the labor of love
_10 cassettes in all _ to his dying friend. Now the guy's widow
thought Judy might like to have the tapes back....``It's been hard,
it still is,'' Judy said. ``People come up to me along the way and
tell me how they lost a husband or a wife. Most everyone says it
takes at least two years until you feel you're not just going
through the motions. You don't realize the void that's there. I
think of Gardner all the time. I can't tell you how many times I go
to call him and then it hits me. No one is there.'' Then last
Friday morning, he was. (Archdeacon, Dayton Daily News.) MOVED.

   SPORT-ENDORSEMENTS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The idea of letting
Mark McGwire walk isn't a new one. McGwire was issued his first
intentional pass of 1998 even before the baseball season began _ by
Reebok. As you might expect with a company that created a shoe
called The Answer, Reebok has one when it's asked the inevitable
question: What were you thinking? (Skolnick, Palm Beach Post.)

   BBN-BROWN-TRADE _ SAN DIEGO _ Kevin Brown didn't like it at
first. Not one bit. It was Dec. 15, and the Florida Marlins had
just traded Brown to the San Diego Padres for three minor-league
prospects. And the prospect of moving almost a continent away from
his Macon, Ga., home, his wife and two sons was pretty unappealing.
Well, it's eight months later, the Padres are sitting atop the
National League West, the Marlins are languishing in last, and
Brown himself his the proud owner of a 14-3 record and an 11-game
winning streak. (Graziano, Palm Beach Post.) MOVED.

   GEORGE-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ All right, so it's

Post.) MOVED.

   NUHN-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ She hit ``rock bottom,'' as she
calls it, in October of 1996. Karen Noble had lost her playing card
after a promising start on the LPGA Tour, was back at Qualifying
School, it was Day One, and she was in the process of shooting 81.
Golf can do that to you; can grab you like a bouncer and start
tossing you around until you're bruised in both body and spirit.
Noble was to that point and beyond. (Nuhn, Dayton Daily News.)

   ARCHDEACON-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ It was a voice she never
dreamed she'd hear again. It came to Judy Dickinson Thursday by
overnight mail. The unexpected package had been sent to Dayton by a
woman in Macon, Ga. When the woman's husband had been dying of
multiple sclerosis and could no longer see, Judy's husband _
Gardner Dickinson _ wanted to do something special. He and the guy
had gone to high school together in the early 1940s. And so,
Gardner _ one of the pioneers of the PGA Tour and Senior PGA Tour _
decided to read the golf book he had written, as well as special
notes and asides, into a tape recorder. He sent the labor of love
_10 cassettes in all _ to his dying friend. Now the guy's widow
thought Judy might like to have the tapes back....``It's been hard,
it still is,'' Judy said. ``People come up to me along the way and
tell me how they lost a husband or a wife. Most everyone says it
takes at least two years until you feel you're not just going
through the motions. You don't realize the void that's there. I
think of Gardner all the time. I can't tell you how many times I go
to call him and then it hits me. No one is there.'' Then last
Friday morning, he was. (Archdeacon, Dayton Daily News.) MOVED.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Urbanworld International Film Festival, a
competitive festival for black independent filmmakers now in its
second year, announced its winners on Sunday after presenting more
than 70 commercial and independent films over five days to an
audience of 5,000 at the Cineplex Odeon Worldwide Plaza Cinemas in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the gravy part,'' Darryl LeMont Wharton said after
winning the award for best director for his feature ``Detention,''
which he described as ``an urban `Breakfast Club.''' Wharton added,
``I'm happy just to have people see the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Wharton, a former writer for the NBC series ``Homicide: Life on
the Streets,'' left the show to make ``Detention,'' which he wrote,
directed and produced with Donna Lynne Comegys. ``Being a black
filmmaker is sort of like the tree in the forest. If you make a
film and nobody sees it, did you really make the film?''
</P>
<P>
   Other winners included Clement Virgo's ``Planet of Junior
Brown,'' based on the novel by Virginia Hamilton, for best picture;
``Classified X,'' Mark Daniels' look at the history of Hollywood's
portrayal of African-Americans, for best documentary; and ``The
Foreigner,'' Zola Mazeko's story about people from other African
countries who fled illegally to post-apartheid South Africa, for
best short. ``Park Day,'' Sterling Macer Jr.'s rite-of-passage
story set at a town picnic, won the Audience Favorite award.
</P>
<P>
   All of the filmmakers received $1,000 worth of Kodak film
donated by Eastman Kodak, a festival sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel A. Tolliver and Jake Ann Jones were awarded the
screenplay prize, sponsored by HBO, for ``Spook City.'' They
received $1,000 jointly, donated by the actor Samuel L. Jackson and
his wife, LaTanya Richardson Jackson, who is a member of the
festival's advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Derek M. Cianfrance's ``Brother Tied'' and Stephen Winter's
``Chocolate Babies'' received honorable mentions in the
best-picture category.

TYLER VOLK: USING FLOWS AND FLUXES TO DEMYTHOLOGIZE THE UNITY OF
LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By JILL NEIMARK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes science and myth merge to make a kind of chimerical
beast, and perhaps the most magical of those Chimeras is the Gaia
hypothesis, developed a quarter century ago by James Lovelock, a
British atmospheric chemist, and Lynn Margulis, an American
microbiologist. The notion that our planet's surface functions like
a giant organism, one interconnected whole, was named after the
Greek earth goddess, and it has attracted not just pagans and
mystics but also atmospheric chemists, ecologists, oceanographers,
microbiologists and geologists.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Volk, 47, is an associate professor of biology at New York
University and a member of the board of directors of Gaia: The
Society for Research and Education in Earth System Science, which
was formed to inspire interdisciplinary research into the Gaia
hypothesis. Volk is a principal investigator with the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration who studies crop growth in
closed systems. He divides his time between New York City and New
Mexico, where he spends summers in a trailer in the Mogollon
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote the recently published Gaia's Body: Toward a Physiology
of Earth (Copernicus).
</P>
<P>
   Q. When Lovelock first discussed the Gaia hypothesis, he
admitted it was at the outer bounds of scientific credibility and
he had a hard time even finding a journal to publish his ideas.
What do you think of the original theory?
</P>
<P>
   A. Gaia started with a stupendous metaphor and a unique
scientific insight, and I think Lovelock has a special charisma. In
a simple sentence, traditional Gaia theory postulates something
called ``comfortable conditions for life,'' and asserts that the
Gaian system maintains those conditions. It looks at the constancy
of temperature, climate, gasses, the ocean environment.
</P>
<P>
   The million-dollar question that Lovelock first asked was, Why
is atmospheric oxygen constant at 21 percent, the level needed to
maintain complex life? But I think there's been too much emphasis
on the ill-defined idea of comfort and on environmental stability.
I think the key is almost the opposite: the flow and flux of life,
of the chemical processes of organisms over the entire planet. The
sheer, raw power of life.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you actually measure something as diverse as life
spread across an entire planet?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm looking at chemical, global productivity. I study the
ratio at which different elements crucial to life are recycled, or
passed from organism to organism. The cycling ratio of an element
instantly reveals the power of life. Take carbon, the heart of life
on our planet. If all that was available was the amount shed from
rocks and volcanoes, a carbon atom might be released into the
environment, utilized just once by an organism, and then buried.
But that's not what happens. Carbon is taken up into an organism
and then recycled, either because the organism dies and becomes
part of the biosphere's resources again, or because it's eaten by
another organism, or because it sheds carbon as waste. A single
atom of carbon is actually recycled 200 times before it is buried.
So you can see the power of the flow of life.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So the cycling ratio of an element is kind of like a
basketball team that keeps passing the ball, and after 200 passes
finally retires it? We know that life is carbon-based, but how
important are the cycling ratios of other elements?
</P>
<P>
   A. The fluxes of all the elements are profoundly revealing,
because they tell us what life needs. Nitrogen's cycling ratio can
be as high as 1,300, which is a huge amplification. And it's no
coincidence that the fluxes of the dozen or so most important
elements in our environment are in rough proportion to the fluxes
of those same elements in our own living bodies. That shows the
unity of life. What's also interesting is how these amplitudes vary
across the planet. I had an epiphany when I was working on the
equatorial belts of the ocean, trying to understand why they
outgassed so much carbon dioxide. I was turning a globe, and I
remember suddenly ``seeing'' this huge loop of carbon dioxide
flowing from the Pacific Ocean to the North Atlantic, and
understanding that the two are one coupled system.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does the notion of a global breath tell us?
</P>
<P>
   A. In part, how much respiration (breathing out carbon dioxide
as waste) and photosynthesis (utilizing carbon dioxide as fuel) is
occurring in both places. And that tells us about the different
organisms there, and about the fact that there is indeed a global
metabolism, with one ocean coupled to the other. And once we can
build this large, coherent kind of picture, we can start to
formulate questions about the planet and how it works.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will understanding the global metabolism give us a window
into the possibility of life on other planets?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A. It might. We know, for instance, that oxygen could not exist
at its current level on the planet without life _ it's far too
reactive a gas, and would on its own combine with other elements
and quickly plunge to low levels. In the case of life,
photosynthesis constantly pours out oxygen and maintains it at high
levels. So the proportion of gasses in a planet's atmosphere may
give us a clue to organisms hundreds of light years away. We may be
able to look at the spectrum of light reflected off a planet, as
Lovelock originally pointed out, and translate that wobble of light
waves into knowledge about the proportion of gasses we're seeing.
And then we'd know if organic life was driving them.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What else do the cycling ratios of elements tell us about our
own planet?
</P>
<P>
   A. They show us the fundamental mechanism of Gaia, which is that
waste equals resource. We're more than just predator and prey.
Eating is only one form of chemical transfer. When an organism's
waste goes out into the world, it can become part of the
atmosphere, ocean, or soil, and become part of a vast chemical web.
The carbon dioxide you exhale while walking in your back yard has
almost as much chance of being taken in by a tree in a forest in
China as by local photosynthesis.
</P>
<P>
   The fluxes of chemicals also give us a whole new way of
classifying life forms by their actual functions rather than as
species or even kingdoms. I think of the world as a symphony of
what I call biochemical guilds. Plants, algae and many bacteria are
members of different kingdoms, but they can be classed as a single
biochemical guild of photosynthesizers. Then there's the guild of
the respirers, which breathe out carbon dioxide and include
everything from frogs to amoeba. There is the guild of nitrogen
fixers, which take gaseous nitrogen and transform it. Nitrogen
fixers are all microbes, although certain kinds of plants like
legumes and some trees harbor the microbes in their roots. If you
order our global metabolism by these guilds you can instantly see
the unity of Gaia. One of the neatest proofs of the existence of
the biochemical guilds is the universal molecular mechanisms shared
by their members, the common metabolic machinery down at the
molecular level.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you give an example of a universal molecule?
</P>
<P>
   A. The green of chlorophyll in all photosynthesizers. I remember
when I first saw this guild, in California. I was looking across a
lake and suddenly the thicket of trees, shrubs and grasses blended
into a single entity. Green. Chlorophyll is the molecule of our
most visible guild. Now wherever I go, this guild speaks to me of
its presence, even in the winter in the desert in New Mexico. It's
as if the guild is saying to me: ``Green is forever.'' The
individual parts aren't as important.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What guild are we part of? The respirers?
</P>
<P>
   A. I call us the guild that knows all other guilds. We're not
only respirers. We're alchemists, too; we can actually fix nitrogen
without the help of bacteria. They use enzymes. We use heat in
factories, and manufacture fertilizers that way. And we take fossil
fuel carbons like coal and oil and burn them. We're the first guild
that is adding to the chemical fluxes with devices set up outside
our bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Q. This use of technology to augment or replace natural
processes sounds like a monumental shift. Or are we just doing what
life always does, and amplifying cycling ratios?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's the classic question. I think we've taken over the
planet in many ways, and, though we will probably never wipe out
the microbes, we need to think about what kind of world we want,
and the disruption we may cause by changing our ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   Q. We're losing species at a tremendous rate, and, it seems,
drastically altering the climate through the greenhouse effect. Can
Gaian science help us preserve ourselves? It sounds like the whole
system is hinged together in an exquisitely subtle way.
</P>
<P>
   A. We can measure the biomass of algae and launch satellites to
monitor ozone and pull up sediment from lakes to learn which trees
lived during the last Ice Age. And then we can start to understand
the critical points where the system would collapse. So we can
learn, for instance, how to apply nitrogen fertilizer at the proper
times and doses, to limit the runoff that endangers ecosystems. Or
we can phase out the release of chlorofluorocarbons. Gaia shows
that our actions affect all other life and always come back to us.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your Gaia sounds almost as romantic and mythic as Lovelock's.
Do you really feel you've stripped the metaphor from the science,
or are you still seduced by it?
</P>
<P>
   A. I've tried to be more exact with the phrase ``global
metabolism'' rather than ``global organism.'' But I may have only
partly succeeded. I was walking in a canyon the other day and
listening to the thunder, and I thought to myself: ``There's Zeus
talking.'' And recently I stopped a truck from running over a
rattlesnake, and as the snake crawled off into the bush I thought:
``Well, now all the rattlesnakes will know I'm a good guy and I'll
have a little bit of coinage next time I hike in the canyons.''
That way of thinking is so deep and so important to us. This mixing
human qualities into nature runs deep in civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Q. It's our way of connecting to the world by seeing and feeling
it as self, rather than other.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's why we painted lions' heads on human bodies, why we
turned rain and wind into gods. If I really feel I'm living inside
Gaia, if the whole body of the biosphere becomes my self, then I'm
truly part of the world. It's important to loosen up the concept of
self because if you extend it into the world you're more likely to
want to engage with the world, to play in it, not just to see it as
a resource for food.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So in that sense, the Gaia metaphor is as powerful a siren
song as ever.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. As is the science. If you want to worship mystery,
studying the global metabolism is a great way to go.

<P>
   Muscle cells transplanted from rabbits' legs to their hearts
boosted cardiac performance, possibly by having ``learned'' within
days how to act like neighboring heart cells, a new study shows.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the transplanted leg cells functioned for as long
as 16 weeks after being inserted into the heart muscle, far longer
than expected, Duke University researchers reported.
</P>
<P>
   The molecular biologists who conducted the study believe cells
extracted from leg tissue may have even developed the bioelectrical
properties that enable the heart to contract and pump blood. How
the transplanted cells work is not known, and other researchers
warned that concluding that the cells had changed would be
premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be very careful in concluding they turned into
another type of cell,'' said Dr. David Diechek of the University of
California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said that even if the transplanted cells did not
fundamentally transform, the Duke procedure, reported in the August
issue of the journal Nature Medicine, was a preliminary
demonstration that one type of muscle cell can help another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is clearly happening when you put these cells in,''
said Loren Field, a molecular biologist at Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most muscles, heart tissue does not regenerate after it
is damaged, because it contains no reserve of embryonic muscle
cells, or myoblasts, that could quickly mature and restore the
heart's normal function.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the dead cells form scar tissue that does not flex when
the remaining healthy heart muscles pump. Blood flow and pressure
are diminished with potentially fatal results.
</P>
<P>
   In the Duke experiment, Doris Taylor, a biologist, and others
damaged the hearts of 17 rabbits to mimic the scar tissue that
forms after a heart attack. Five of the rabbits were control
animals that received no further treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers took muscle biopsies from the legs of the 12
remaining rabbits and grew myoblasts in cell cultures. The rapidly
dividing cells were then transfused into the rabbits' damaged
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Within five to 10 days, the cardiac performance of seven rabbits
had improved noticeably.
</P>
<P>
   Microscopic analysis showed that the transplanted cells had
developed intercalated disks, ``a distinctly cardiac feature,'' Ms.
Taylor said, that is involved in transferring from cell to cell the
electrical charge that powers the heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers said more experiments were necessary with
higher ratios of successful transplants _ and possibly using other
species.
</P>
<P>
   Killer Spice
</P>
<P>
   Clove-burgers, anyone? The idea might turn some stomachs but
might also be good for digestive tracts, say researchers who
examined the ability of common spices to kill E. coli 0157:H7, the
much discussed, much feared, food-contaminating bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Spices have been used for centuries to make food safer to eat in
hot countries, and other studies have tested the ability of spices
to kill bacteria. But in this country, worries about E. coli have
risen since 1993, when four children died after eating hamburgers
contaminated with it in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   With these fears in mind, biologists at Kansas State University
applied 23 spices to raw ground beef and salami containing E. coli
to see which was most effective in destroying it. Their findings,
which were presented this summer at a meeting of the Institute of
Food Technologists, showed the winners were garlic, clove,
cinnamon, oregano and sage.
</P>
<P>
   A mixture of 7.5 percent clove to 92.5 percent ground beef
killed 99 percent of the bacteria, said Dr. Daniel Fung, while a
more palatable level _ 2.5 percent clove _ killed 90 percent.
Similarly, 99 percent of the bacteria died when salami was
fermented with about three times as much garlic as even a garlic
lover would want, but a more moderate dose still killed about half,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fung stressed that a heavy hand with spices should not be
considered a substitute for cooking meat thoroughly.

POULOS LOSES IN STRAIGHT SETS TO MIYAGI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ Life at the collegiate level, where Jennifer
Poulos was a three-time All-American at Cal-Berkeley, was never
like this. In the pros, there are no teammates, no coaches, no one
to greet you whether you win or lose. That is, unless you have the
money to allow a coach to travel with you, which Poulos doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Poulos, a Brookline, Mass. native, is in her second year as a
pro. She's ranked No. 320, while her twin sister, Valerie, who also
played at Cal, is No. 720. They're together about half the time,
giving each other someone to commiserate with after losing a match,
someone to go to dinner with, someone to take practice strokes
with.
</P>
<P>
   Monday at Babson College, in a center-court match in the Boston
Cup, part of the Corel WTA Tour, MondayNina Miyagi of Japan
defeated Poulos, 6-4, 6-4. In her 10th pro year, Miyagi, who is
ranked 95th, has been part of her country's Fed Cup team since
1987, both in singles and doubles, and she owns victories over
Martina Hingis and Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Poulos, playing in her first WTA event, was nervous when she
took the court, knowing Miyagi was better than most of the players
she has been facing. She had seen Miyagi play in qualifying Sunday
and went into the match concerned about Miyagi's quickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very good player,'' said Poulos, whose serve was
broken six times, three in each set. ``I like to hit the ball flat
as well as move in, but I didn't feel in control of the points. She
hit the ball pretty deep and hard and it's difficult to play
someone at her level. She moves the ball very well and she's pretty
consistent. My serve wasn't very consistent and I knew she would be
aggressive with the returns and put pressure on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot different than when I was in college, with the
girls here pressuring me a lot more, these girls are much better
players. I played positive most of the time and I kept playing the
way I wanted to _ that was to stay on the baseline and hit
aggressively. I didn't think about playing in the main draw,
though, or I would have played worse. I just have to practice and
get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Poulos, who made the NCAA round of 16 each year as a collegian,
received a wild card to get in here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough playing against a wild card,'' said Miyagi. ``They
have nothing to lose, and I'm the one with a lot of pressure. I
didn't play well, though. I didn't feel comfortable. I was giving
too many free points away. I was spraying a lot of balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Poulos's traveling has been in the United States since
January, but she's been to Brazil, France, England, and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to travel alone and to play well and motivate
yourself,'' said Poulos, who is supported financially by her
parents. ``It's hard to find people you like to stay with in a
hotel and to watch you play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sometimes frustrating to play a match and to lose and not
to have someone there to help you. Maybe I'll be upset and maybe I
won't play the next day. You need someone to analyze your game
because you're more negative about yourself. A coach or someone to
watch you can put it in more perspective for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness Poulos has her sister.

DANCE AWARD GOES TO JACOB'S PILLOW
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (ll) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival has won the
47th-Annual Capezio Dance Award. The summer festival, in Becket,
Mass., was honored in a ceremony on Saturday night at the Ted Shawn
Theater there. The award is given to dancers, choreographers, dance
companies and institutions in recognition of their contributions to
dance in the United States. The Pillow is the first producing
organization to win the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Jacob's Pillow ``a total environment for the art of
dance,'' Gayle Miller of the Capezio/Ballet Makers Dance Foundation
presented a check for $10,000 to Ella Baff, director of the
festival. Three previous festival directors _ Liz Thompson, Sam
Miller and Sali Ann Kriegsman _ joined Ms. Baff on stage for the
event, with officials of the foundation and Neil D. Chrisman,
chairman of the Pillow board.
</P>
<P>
   Barton Mumaw, a member of Ted Shawn's first Men Dancers company
and a longtime Pillow teacher, represented Shawn, who in 1930
bought and built up the Pillow grounds as a home for the men's
dance troupe. Shawn, who with his wife, Ruth St. Denis, was a
pioneering figure in American modern dance, directed the festival
through 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The four directors onstage, whose tenures span the last eight
years, are widely perceived as representing a new era in the
history of the festival. Ms. Thompson, who led the festival in 1989
and 1990, is credited with having taken the first steps to open the
Pillow to a somewhat wider range of dance, music and performance
art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt a need to make a wonderful home for dancers,'' Ms.
Thompson said in an interview after the ceremony. ``And the place
is magic.'' She said her background in traditional, modern and
postmodern dance and in Broadway and television, along with her
commitment to ``cultural equity,'' inspired her to extend the range
of a festival already known for its eclecticism.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baff said the Capezio money would go to artists and their
projects at the Pillow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one other really important thing about the award,''
she said. ``It is a great honor beyond any dollar value. It is both
recognition and encouragement to achieve and reach our next
destinations, and we have a lot of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival runs through Aug. 29, with engagements by the Jose
Greco II Flamenco Dance Company and the performance artist Ann
Carlson this week and by the Twyla Tharp and Urban Bush Women
companies from Aug. 18 to 23. It closes with ``Invisible Wings,''
an outdoor work by Joanna Haigood's Zaccho Dance Theater from Aug.
25 to 29, about the northward journeys of escaped slaves through
the Pillow grounds, a stop on the Underground Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   The award ceremony also honored the memory of Alfred Terlizzi,
the foundation's president, who died this year. A brother, Donald,
has been named to succeed him.

 TIMES SQUARE VISITORS TO GET HIGH-TECH HELP  
 TOURS OF PARIS FOR THE FRENCH-IMPAIRED  
 THOMAS WOLFE'S HOUSE IS DAMAGED BY FIRE  
 GETTING A HEAD START ON A VAN GOGH SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Aug. 16)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Times Square, in the midst of its big cleanup, is
about to open a new visitors center in a restored movie theater.
The center, on the east side of Broadway between 46th and 47th
streets, will even provide public restrooms, that rarest of
Manhattan amenities, when it opens next month.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., will sell
Metrocards for subway travel and provide six ATMs, free Internet
access at six terminals, and a machine that converts currency. The
human race is represented in an information booth with live
attendants.
</P>
<P>
   The theater-ticket booth will offer full-price tickets to all
Broadway shows (no off-Broadway yet, and the TKTS booth across the
street will remain the place for discounted tickets), and Gray Line
and Circle Line tour tickets will be sold as well. For those who
need some news from home, Hotalings will sell out-of-town
newspapers. And official New York City souvenirs will be sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Square Business Improvement District will run the
center in the former Embassy Theater, a Louis XVI style movie house
that opened in 1925. It has two lobbies _ one with marble trim, the
other with ornate woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   The theater itself was adorned with six landscapes by Arthur
Crisp, a New York muralist whose work appeared in numerous
commercial buildings from the 1920s, and two of these have been
restored, along with the original Rambusch ceiling lights.
</P>
<P>
   Tours of Paris for the French-Impaired
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, nearly all walking tours of Paris were given
in French. The English-speaking tourist usually had to be content
with a sheet containing the essential facts to be covered by the
guide.
</P>
<P>
   There always came a moment as the group walked through castle or
street when the guide would say something and all the French
tourists would laugh while the Americans would just look down at
the written sheet, feeling slightly left out. Now Americans can be
in on the joke, too.
</P>
<P>
   Paris Walking Tours, run by an engaging and well-informed young
English couple, Peter and Oriel Caine, takes English-speaking
tourists through Notre-Dame, Sainte-Chapelle, the Luxembourg
Gardens, Hemingway's Paris, the old village of Montmartre, medieval
Paris, the Invalides, Cluny, the Arcades of Old Paris and the
Palais Royal, Paris of the impressionists, the Ile St.-Louis and
the Seine, the Conciergerie, the Marais and the Opera House, as
well as on bus trips to Vaux-le-Vicomte, Malmaison and Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   The tours, which vary from week to week, last about 90 minutes
and are full of historical gossip and humor. Paris Walking Tours
offers one tour a day, usually at 10:30 a.m. or 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like to plan ahead, you can find a list in
Pariscope. Reservations are not required _ just show up at the
designated Metro stop.
</P>
<P>
   For information, call (33-1) 48.09.21.40 or fax (33-1)
42.43.75.51. The fee is $10, $5 for children.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wolfe's House Is Damaged by Fire
</P>
<P>
   The Asheville, N.C., boardinghouse that was the childhood home
of Thomas Wolfe and the setting for his autobiographical novel
``Look Homeward, Angel'' stands empty and charred after a fire on
July 24 that authorities believe was set deliberately.
</P>
<P>
   The house, a national historic landmark that attracts 25,000
visitors a year, will be restored but will probably remain closed
for at least a year, according to Mary Cook, director of public
affairs for the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   An arsonist apparently threw combustible objects through the
first-floor dining-room window to start the fire, according to
Harley Shuford, director of the Asheville-Bruncombe County Arson
Task Force. After destroying dining-room furniture and melting
display silver, flames crept up the side of the building and
consumed the attic and roof.
</P>
<P>
   Much original furniture was saved by firefighters, who rushed to
recover what pieces they could as they hosed down the 115-year-old
Victorian house, Ms. Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Other artifacts, including Wolfe's writing desk and typewriter,
had recently been moved to the nearby visitors center in
anticipation of a restoration in the fall, when a fire-alarm and
security system were to be added.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors center, where the desk, the typewriter and other
artifacts are on display, along with exhibits pertaining to Wolfe's
life and works, will remain open. Hours: Monday through Saturday 9
a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday 1 to 5 p.m.; (828) 253-8304.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a Head Start on a Van Gogh Show
</P>
<P>
   Vincent van Gogh is so popular that the National Gallery of Art
in Washington has decided to start issuing passes for its
exhibition this fall two months before the show opens.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy van Gogh paintings, on loan from the Van Gogh Museum in
Amsterdam, the Netherlands, will be on view from Oct. 4 to Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite possible that attendance for the show, ``Van Gogh's
Van Goghs,'' will exceed that of the gallery's 1995-96 Vermeer
exhibition, which drew more than 300,000 people, and will challenge
the record set by its biggest show, last year's survey of the works
of the young Picasso, which drew more than 500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Passes, which are free, will be required for admission and will
be available beginning Aug. 30 at the gallery's East Building
during its regular hours, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Saturday, and
11 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. A visitor may have up to six passes.
</P>
<P>
   Advance passes may also be obtained in the Washington area at
Ticketmaster locations and Hecht's stores for a service charge of
$2 each. They can also be bought through Ticketmaster Phone Charge
for $2.75 each plus $1.25 an order.
</P>
<P>
   The Ticketmaster number to call outside the Washington area is
(800) 551-7328.
</P>
<P>
   The local numbers are (202) 432-7328 in Washington, (703)
573-7328 in northern Virginia and (410) 481-7328 in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Same-day passes will be issued each day, also with a limit of
six to a person.

RIGHTS GROUP SEEKS TO HELP CANDIDATES UNDERSTAND GAY ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A leading gay rights organization is urging
candidates not to discount homosexual issues in the upcoming
elections, encouraging campaigns to speak out against
discrimination based on sexual orientation and support the role of
government in combating AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest bipartisan gay
political group, has published a pamphlet to help candidates
understand gay issues and answer questions about gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-page pamphlet includes a forward with advice from Sheila
Burke, who served as chief of staff under former Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and former White House senior adviser and
Democratic campaign strategist George Stephanopoulos.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said gay voters are ``increasingly important in the
electoral process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to understand the issues, be knowledgeable and speak
about them in a way that respects and includes their perspective,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Five percent of the general election voters in 1996 were gay,
the Human Rights Campaign said, citing exit poll interviews. Burke
said issues gay voters are concerned about _ equality in the
workplace, health care and AIDS _ transcend political lines.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos wrote that the Human Rights Campaign could help
candidates ``be a pioneer for change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The gay and lesbian community is organized, educated and it
votes,'' Stephanopoulos wrote for the booklet.
</P>
<P>
   The organization urged candidates to consider these issues, and
responses, important to gay constituents:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fairness in the workplace. The Human Rights Campaign said
federal labor laws do not protect gays from discrimination based on
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   _ HIV and AIDS: Candidates should emphasize the role of the
government in the fight against HIV _ the AIDS virus _ and AIDS.
``We can't let down our guard in the fight against AIDS, '' the
pamphlet says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Violent hate crimes: According to the FBI, anti-gay sentiment
is number three on the list of reasons for hate crimes. The
pamphlet includes an incident in which two gay man were ridiculed
and assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   _ Families and adoption: Parents and professionals should make
the decision about gay and lesbian partners adopting children, not
the government, the pamphlet advises.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marriage: Candidates should advocate marriage, regardless of
sexual orientation. ``The government should not interfere in
personal matters like marriage. The choice of a spouse is a very
personal decision that should be left up to the individual,'' the
pamphlet says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Equal compensation: Health insurance and other workplace
benefits should be available to domestic partners, including
homosexuals, the pamphlet says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Discrimination in the military: The Human Rights Campaign
booklet urges candidates to tell voters that gays have served with
distinction in the military. ``We need a military that is trained,
equipped and ready, and we can't waste anybody with skills and
dedication,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   The manual is available from the Washington-based Human Rights
Campaign by calling 202-628-4160.

 &HT;    Ex-Spin controller launches a new magazine
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Publisher Bob Guccione Jr., creator of Spin magazine, is scared
again. And he's enjoying every sweaty-palmed second of it.
</P>
<P>
   In launching Gear this month, the son of Penthouse publisher Bob
Guccione is aiming for the same Generation X readers that made Spin
a success. The bimonthly's inaugural issue arrives on newsstands
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same feeling all over again,'' says the younger
Guccione, who is Gear's editor. ``It's a little frightening and a
lot exciting. With Spin, so many people told me: `You can't take on
Rolling Stone and survive.' My point was that there was a need
there for some different, something more.''
</P>
<P>
   After selling Spin last year to Vibe magazine founder Quincy
Jones for ``a fantastically high price'' _ published reports put it
at $42 million _ Spin's ``bored'' creator searched for a new
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   His solution: Take on industry mainstays GQ, Esquire and
Details, his closest competitor for readers younger than 40. The
42-year-old didn't exactly scour the competition for ideas. He paid
more attention to Cosmopolitan and European music and men's
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want the self-consciousness of GQ or Details. It's
hollow journalism,'' he says. ``I wanted Gear to have the courage
to really probe the culture, something that would go against the
consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Guccione isn't above resorting to his dad's stock in trade,
though. In the debut issue, Guccione's parish priest, Michael
Holleran, writes a column headlined ``God wants you to be sexy.''
The accompanying photo shows a bikini-clad woman posing in front of
a monumental crucifix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, sex would be a part of it. Attraction is a very powerful
thing and something you shouldn't feel ashamed of,'' Guccione says.
</P>
<P>
   That explains the revealing photos of ``La Femme Nikita''
actress Peta Wilson. But there are also serious pieces, like an
investigative take on Iraq in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War
and a profile of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a possible presidential
contender. More traditional men's magazine fare includes an
unpublished, four-year-old interview with actor Matt Damon, a
fashion spread and movie, album and video game reviews. The slick
European design is reminiscent of Spin.
</P>
<P>
   The first assignment Guccione gave himself was an interview with
his father's longtime rival, Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can imagine, there was a natural tension but in a
positive way,'' the younger Guccione says. ``He gave our readers
some great fatherly advice. He was gracious about my father and
their rivalry.'' And did the elder Guccione help with a list of
questions for Hefner? ``No,'' Guccione says matter-of-factly. ``He
didn't know about it and I didn't give him an advance look at the
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Guccione realizes he faces a formidable battle in starting
another men's magazine. Gear's estimated circulation of 200,000 is
still dwarfed by the estimated circulation of GQ (688,752), Esquire
(657,718) and Details (484,563). He hopes he can beat the odds
again, as he did when he started Spin in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Gear to be different spiritually,'' Guccione says. ``I
will always want to challenge the status quo.

COYOTE ATTACK ON TODDLER REMAINS A MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ State wildlife officials say they are stumped in trying
to figure out why a coyote attacked a toddler on Cape Cod, the
first documented case in Massachusetts and one of only a handful
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Lab results released Monday indicate the coyote did not have
distemper, mange or any other disease that might prompt an animal
to attack a human.
</P>
<P>
   Rabies was ruled out immediately after police shot the animal
following the July 29 attack on 3-year-old Daniel Neal, who was
playing on his backyard swingset.
</P>
<P>
   With no answers to why the attack occurred, the anxiety among
Cape residents who seem to encounter coyotes at every turn is
likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very concerned still,'' said Steven Chapman, the
animal control officer in Sandwich. ``They are very scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators last week interviewed the boy's mother, who had to
kick and punch the coyote to get it to release her son, and
neighbors in Sandwich, but they found no evidence that someone had
been feeding or caring for the coyote.
</P>
<P>
   Wild animals that have become accustomed to people sometimes
lose their normal predatory skills and attack humans if their food
supply is interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't leave us in a good position,'' said Rob Deblinger,
the state's assistant director for wildlife. ``We have not answered
the question of why this animal attacked a human.''
</P>
<P>
   The coyote's right front leg had been fractured and healed some
time ago, possibly an indication the coyote was hit by a car and
picked up and nursed back to health. But so far, no one has
admitted caring for the coyote.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman said police received a call shortly after the coyote was
killed from an unidentified man who claimed he had been feeding the
coyote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know who it was that called,'' Chapman said. ``We're
trying to get information on that now, but that's going to be
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Although coyotes are normally skittish around humans, officials
said this particular coyote may have been just abnormally
aggressive. ``There is always the possibility that this animal was
on the extreme edge of the curve in terms of aggressiveness,''
Deblinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the handful of coyote attacks on humans nationwide, most have
taken place out West, many in California. But Deblinger said
California officials have told Massachusetts officials that a
campaign to educate people about how to deal with wild animals has
all but eliminated the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Deblinger said Massachusetts plans to develop its own campaign
in the wake of the attack on the toddler. He said Massachusetts
residents would be urged not to feed a wild animal and keep pets
and their food inside.
</P>
<P>
   While Deblinger has said state wildlife officials would like the
right to use padded leg-hold traps to deal with nuisance coyotes,
he said the agency has no plans to try to overturn a 1996 law
passed by referendum that bars the use of the traps.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's going to be a change in that law, it's going to
come from the people,'' he said.

 &HT;    It's too bad a girl's looks matter most
 &HT;    By Maureen Downey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A baby girl dozing on an airplane last week wore more jewelry
than Ivana Trump.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all Wal-Mart specials,'' I overheard her mother tell a
seatmate. ``She'll have to work on getting herself a rich man to
afford the real stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   I fought the urge to turn around and suggest that her daughter
could buy her own ankle bracelets if encouraged to focus on her
school books rather than her datebook.
</P>
<P>
   I've bristled at such comments about little girls ever since my
daughter was a newborn and a woman in a hardware store announced,
``She's going to make some man very happy some day.''
</P>
<P>
   She meant it as a compliment; I found it a startling reminder
that women are still prized for their ability to attract men. That
attitude helps explain Monica Lewinsky, who wasted the most coveted
internship in the country to hone skills that can't go on a resume.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky somehow got the message that her self-worth depended on
grabbing the attention of powerful older men. No matter that the
man was married and the attention was hooded and brief.
</P>
<P>
   My hopes that things had changed were dashed recently when I
interviewed a mother who insisted that her 13-month-old daughter
``loves'' kiddie beauty contests. Sure, the $300 sequined pageant
costumes strain the household budget, but the women viewed these as
an investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being really good-looking,'' she explained, ``is still a
girl's best chance in life.''
</P>
<P>
   High status is what counts for the guys
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Maureen is hard on powerful, dumpy men who get babes. In her
idealized world, the Donald Trumps would be lonely.
</P>
<P>
   She's even harder on the girls who go for these louts. Why, she
wonders, do they still buy into the myth that they need a
successful man?
</P>
<P>
   I have bad news for Maureen. Women are genetically selected to
dig lead dogs. It's a biological imperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a certain sense it's beyond choice,'' says Dr. Randy
Thornhill. ``Female brains are designed to prefer high-status
males.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornhill, an evolutionary biologist at the University of New
Mexico, studies the mating behavior of scorpion flies, red jungle
fowl and humans. He finds that creatures great and small have
similar strategies for procreation. Out there in the wild,
good-looking females get together with successful males. ``These
rules are universal, wherever there are critters.''
</P>
<P>
   Feminists cry that our warped attitudes make a Monica Lewinsky
yearn after a Big Enchilada like Bill Clinton, instead of depending
on her own achievements. But Thornhill says it's Monica's DNA
pushing her toward a date with the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, high-achieving but unpalatable women like
Margaret Thatcher and Roseanne could reverse this trend. With a few
million more years of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Glad I'm going to miss it.

 &HT;    COLUMN: For a few minutes, Dr. Laura claims to be listening
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news story didn't report it, but they had to be doing
cartwheels at WSB-AM in Atlanta last week when Laura Schlessinger
signed on for another two years. What the story did say was enough
_ that Dr. Laura's nationally syndicated show was No. 1 in her time
slot. For three hours, from noon to 3, no one in Atlanta has more
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   That's not surprising, just ironic.
</P>
<P>
   She's getting rich telling people to go take on the day. She
tells them more than that, of course, and therein lies the irony.
</P>
<P>
   They are the listeners; she is the talker.
</P>
<P>
   They start out as the talkers, telling Dr. Laura what fresh
crisis (``Do you think I should tell my father-in-law we'd rather
he not smoke in our house?'') has sent them forth into Gethsemane.
But they don't talk long and she doesn't listen long.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura may have listeners, legions of them. But she is not
herself a listener.
</P>
<P>
   She is an unusually poor listener, when you think about it. She
listens long enough to set someone straight, to tell them how to
think and what to think. She doesn't have time for them, and the
listener without time is no listener at all.
</P>
<P>
   It is radio, of course, and not the confessional. The phone
lines are backed up. You have to get 'em on and get 'em off. That
is the nature of the business, but it is not the face the show
presents to its audience. The face it presents is one of advice and
understanding. It is to counseling what the drive-in window is to
eating. You are handed your bag of moral absolutes and sent on your
way, reassured for the moment, chastised but not changed.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging up, callers return to their crummy lives and their daily
doubts. The same doubts and uncertainties they had before they
called Dr. Laura.
</P>
<P>
   In her view of life, there are no uncertainties. She is like the
soldier who claims not to know the meaning of fear, only duty.
</P>
<P>
   All of us should be so lucky. Getting through the day could be
reduced to an instruction manual.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to talk impartially about Dr. Laura. Listeners hang on
her every word with the devotion of disciples. Critics, in their
bitterness, betray the very failings she sees in them _ pretense
and falsity.
</P>
<P>
   Give her credit for this: She is a tocsin in a culture gone
nutty with ``self-esteem,'' one that believes feelings are
paramount. This is one of the reasons the therapy crowd doesn't
like her _ feelings are their bread and butter. Her views are not
so different from those of Robyn Dawes, an academic psychologist at
Carnegie-Mellon University(Penn.) whose book ``House of Cards''
sharply criticizes clinical psychologists for palming off bogus
ideas as reliable advice.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, they are not so different from those of one of
the seminal American thinkers, William James. ``The hell to be
endured hereafter,'' James wrote, ``is no worse than the hell we
make for ourselves in this world by habitually fashioning our
characters in the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   You know Dr. Laura would second that. But I wonder if she'd
agree with James on something else: ``In the deepest heart of all
of us there is a corner in which the ultimate mystery of things
works sadly.''
</P>
<P>
   If it has a melancholy ring to it, so much the better. Most
people, sooner or later, encounter the truth of it. When they do,
they often want someone to talk to. They seek out pastors and
parish priests, rabbis, therapists, trusted friends, bosses, even
bartenders.
</P>
<P>
   Religious people have been thought to possess, it not an in with
God, at least a higher spirituality that somehow qualifies them to
understand mere humans. It doesn't always work that way, as many
have found out. In this century, psychology and psychiatry compete
with religion, with therapists and analysts as secular substitutes
for clergy.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't matter what they are _ this is one of Robyn
Dawes' points. What matters is that they know how to listen. It's
not so much something they've learned, but part of their makeup.
Some people listen better than others, just as one person can carry
a tune and another can't. Most people make a show of listening, if
only as a gesture. But they're not really there. They are somewhere
else _ in their own thoughts, readying their reply, doodling,
checking their watch, anywhere but in the heart of another.
</P>
<P>
   Or they might be in a hurry to get to the next caller.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a bad racket. And you can't beat the hours.

 &HT;    After nine years of trying to make it, Atlanta musician Shawn
Mullins is enjoying overnight success
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   How long does it take to become an overnight success?
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Mullins can do the math. But he'd rather sing and play
guitar which, after nine years kicking around Atlanta's acoustic
music scene, is about to make him famous.
</P>
<P>
   And if you haven't yet heard ``Lullaby,'' the 30-year-old
performer's out-of-the-blue breakthrough, you will. Oh yeah. You'll
be hearing a lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a month ago that Atlanta modern rock radio station
99X (WNNX-FM) added the songwriter's ballad _ a track from his
latest self-produced album ``Soul's Core'' _ to its playlist.
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks, Mullins signed a lucrative recording deal with
Columbia Records.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in between was a blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many (record) labels on my answering machine it
was out of control,'' says Mullins, a Decatur, Ga. native who
became the prize in a corporate tug of war that also included
Atlantic Records and Universal Records, among an estimated 10 to 15
labels that expressed viable interest. ``This is the kind of thing
that happens in movies,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The song is a haunting vignette about a lost, jaded soul amid
the Hollywood glitter, complete with prominently strummed guitar
and a vaguely hip-hop drum track that echoes the grunge-folk of
Beck's ``Loser.'' What sets ``Lullaby'' apart is the juxtaposition
of Mullins' sweetly sung refrain _ ``Everything's gonna be all
right/Rockabye'' _ with spoken segments that confide the story,
emphasizing a gruff, knowing edge in the singer's voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great, wonderful, classic rock song,'' says Will
Bottwin, general manager for Columbia Records, and a former manager
of such songwriters' songwriters as Steve Earle, John Hiatt, Lyle
Lovett, Nanci Griffith and Rosanne Cash. ``Everybody who hears it
gets it right away. The first time I heard it I thought, wow, this
is a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottwin likens the tune's appeal ``to a great Don Henley song,
like 'Boys of Summer,' or a 'Memphis' from Mark Cohn.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 99X launched the song into heavy rotation, it's rippled
onto about six other playlists, including that of Q101 in Chicago.
A remixed version of ``Lullaby'' is being aggressively promoted to
alternative rock stations nationwide, with a slightly revised
version of ``Soul's Core'' to be rush-released Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The rock'n'roll domino effect is a tribute to synchronicity:
right song, right place, right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the whole reason I got into radio in the first
place,'' says Leslie Fram, the program director of 99X whose ears
are becoming increasingly influential. ``You hear something
terrific and want to share it with the listeners.'' Fram heard
``Lullaby'' after Mullins sent a copy of the song _ as he routinely
does with new material _ to Steve Craig, host of the station's
``Locals Only'' program, which features original music by Atlanta
and Athens-based acts. ``I was blown away,'' Fram continues. ``The
song begins with that sort of Lou Reed vocal/speak thing but then
the chorus hits you. It's amazingly hooky. Sometimes you just know
a hit record the first time you listen to it. I called Shawn into
my office and said: 'We're going to add `Lullaby' to our playlist.
Get ready because your life's going to change.' Immediately, we had
very strong phone calls on it. Everyone was asking, `who is
that?'''
</P>
<P>
   The station's clout is such that prominent new additions to its
playlist can establish a chain reaction. ``We're in a cycle right
now where radio is all powerful,'' says Russell Carter, the Decatur
manager of Atlanta's most successful folk-pop act, Indigo Girls,
who has signed on to help direct Mullins' career. ``It's highly
unusual for a seasoned singer-songwriter as talented as Shawn to
all of a sudden have a pop hit, prior to being signed to a label.
That's why everyone descended on Atlanta within a week's notice.''
</P>
<P>
   What they found is what local audiences have enjoyed for a
decade. ``He has such a good rapport,'' says Eddie Owen, owner of
Eddie's Attic and former manager of the Trackside Tavern,
epicenters of the acoustic scene that propelled the Indigo Girls to
fame in the late '80s. ``He's a real personable onstage kind of
guy, and he's always aw-shuckin' 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullins, who lives in Ormewood Park with his girlfriend and
business partner, Kelly Hobbs, and his beagle, Roadie, grew up in
Decatur as the youngest of three siblings, and attended Clarkston
High School. Both his father, John Mullins, and grandfather, Layton
Mullins, worked for the old Southern Railway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I heard a lot of train stories,'' he says, while
noting that he was more directly influenced by Joni Mitchell,
</P>
<P>
   Kris Kristofferson and Isaac Hayes. ``I played street hockey and
ran track. I played Little League football, but I didn't really do
too well. I always went back to my room and played guitar. I always
prefered that to rolling around with a bunch of guys, bumping my
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Makes sense, though Mullins couldn't know then that his early
focus on making music would pay off so handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a phenomenal deal,'' Mullins says of his freshly inked
contract, which allows him to keep rights to his back catalog --
eight albums in all -- and provides for tour support, among other
``must-haves'' the singer wrote down on a piece of scratch paper
before he began meeting with label honchos.
</P>
<P>
   It's a phenomenal enough deal that no one's mentioning specific
sums. ``He has enough money to buy a new guitar,'' allows Bottwin,
``but he might not be able to buy a tour bus.''
</P>
<P>
   And, for certain, he won't need to sell CDs out of his car trunk
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped shopping myself to record companies five years
ago,'' he says. ``I used to try every year, and get rejection
letter after rejection letter. I thought, 'Damn, what am I doing
with my life?' But I hit the road really hard and kept making
records and it paid off. My change of focus was a reason why these
people were interested. Once they got me and I sat in front of them
with a guitar, they went `Oh!'''

 &HT;    Vanity Fair offers `Full' look at Tom Wolfe
 &HT;    By Don O'Braint
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The jury is still out on what Tina Brown's departure will mean
for The New Yorker, but obviously her absence hasn't hurt Vanity
Fair ($3.50). The September issue is one of the best ever, with a
profile of Tom Wolfe, a dissection of Laura Schlessinger and a
juicy excerpt from Joyce Maynard's soon-to-be-published memoir of
her teenage affair with the reclusive J.D. Salinger.
</P>
<P>
   In his first interview about ``A Man in Full,'' Wolfe talks
about the evolution of his 750-page novel and his determination to
make it bigger than ``The Bonfire of the Vanities.'' Wolfe got the
idea for the story on a 1989 visit to some South Georgia
plantations with Atlantans Mack and Mary Rose Taylor. Originally,
the novel was to be set in New York, with protagonist Charlie
Croker traveling to Georgia on weekends. When Wolfe realized it was
beginning to read like another variation on ``Bonfire,'' he shifted
the scene to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing editor David Kamp, one of a handful of people to
see the almost-finished manuscript, reports that the novel is told
from five narrative points of view and centers on Croker, a
real-estate developer and former Georgia Tech football hero who
finds himself $1.3 billion in debt and in danger of losing his
29,000-acre plantation. Other narrators are Roger White, a black
lawyer who defends Fareek Fanon, a football star accused of raping
the daughter of a prominent white Atlanta businessman; Conrad
Hensley, an employee at Croker Global Foods in Oakland, Calif.;
Raymond Peepgass, a loan officer at Croker's bank; and Martha
Croker, Charlie Croker's middle-aged first wife. After being
granted an exclusive interview by Wolfe's publisher Farrar, Straus
&AMP; Giroux, Kamp shamelessly proclaims ``A Man in Full'' as ``a
better novel than its predecessor.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the magazine, Leslie Bennetts dishes up a
deliciously malicious look at the darker side of Dr. Laura.
According to Bennetts, the holier-than-thou radio shrink hasn't
spoken to her mother in years, has a sister she never mentions,
prefers to ignore her first marriage and slept her way to the top.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, Joyce Maynard reveals just how weird Salinger is
in a memoir about her affair with the reclusive author 26 years
ago, when she was 18 and he was 53. Obsessed with privacy even
then, the cranky author preferred a diet of raw food, practiced
bulimia after eating pizzas and refused to publish anything after a
certain point because he couldn't stand for his characters to be
criticized. One redeeming quality: He loved ``The Andy Griffith
Show.''

   GAY THERAPY: The ads are appearing more frequently in major
newspapers promising hope for homosexuals who want to convert to
the straight and narrow. In a fascinating cover story, Newsweek
($2.95) looks at the controversial Transformation Ministries and
other conservative groups who believe that gays can change through
willpower and therapy.
</P>
<P>
   NOT WASTING AWAY: Jimmy Buffett had just one Top 10 single,
``Margaritaville,'' and that was 21 years ago. But that hasn't
stopped hundreds of his fans from flocking to his concerts. Time
($2.95) visits the laid-back entertainer at midlife to learn why
fanatic Parrotheads spend more than $50 million a year on tickets,
albums and merchandise (including margarita mix and salt shakers).
The answer: ``He's like an old friend,'' says one supporter. ``No
surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   QUICK READS: If Judith Rich Harris' radical new theory catches
on, we won't be able to blame our parents for the way we've turned
out. In a New Yorker ($3) interview, the New Jersey grandmother
talks about her book, ``The Nurture Assumption,'' which
persuasively assaults conventional ideas of child development.
Peers, not parents, mold children's personality, she says. And lots
of experts agree. ... Just when the controversy over the Modern
Library's 100 best English language novels of the century is
waning, along comes Entertainment Weekly ($2.95) with its list of
all-time greatest lists. Ranked right after ``People's 50 Most
Beautiful People'' are The Ten Commandments and Luther's 95 Theses;
``50 Ways to Leave Your Lover'' weighs in at No. 15.

 &HT;    Three day conference to discuss teen risk health behaviors
 &HT;    By J. Matthew Aldag
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Car crashes. Murder. Suicide. Teens are still dying
from them. Tobacco. Drugs. Unprotected sex. Teens are still doing
them.
</P>
<P>
   Experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have
become concerned with the death rates of teenagers and the habits
they pick up that may be fatal in adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our young people are not nearly as healthy'' as teens in other
areas of the world, said Dr. Lloyd Kolbe, the CDC's director of the
Division of Adolescent and School Health. Kolbe is concerned with
nationwide health efforts that have been unsuccessful in lowering
death rates for those 10 to 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have successfully attained the mortality reduction goals
for every age group except for adolescents and young adults,'' said
Kolbe.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that teen national health objectives for 1990 still
have not been obtained in 1995, leaving grim predictions for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   That problem and others will be discussed when more than 130
experts from across the nation speak at this week's National
Leadership Conference to Strengthen HIV/AIDS Education and
Coordinated School Health Programs. Over 600 health workers are
expected to convene over the next three days at the Omni Hotel
downtown to attend presentations and discuss how to educate teens
about high-risk behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that the teenagers and young adults are killed most
often by car accidents, followed by homicide and suicide. CDC
experts are concerned not only with what kills people while they
are teens, but the habits they pick up that can be fatal later in
life _ drugs, alcohol abuse, poor diet, obesity, lack of exercise,
and high-risk sexual behavior that can lead to acquiring the AIDS
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Adults 25 years of age and older die most often from
cardiovascular disease and cancer, frequently the result of habits
learned in childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to try to understand how we could explain the
problem better to people,'' said Kolbe.
</P>
<P>
   CDC experts hope to increase teen awareness through education,
media influence and parental awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kind of problems aren't going to be fixed by medicine.
Getting the nations schools together with the nations state and
local health departments and having them work together is what is
necessary,'' said Kolbe.
</P>
<P>
   In a 50-nation study of mortality rates, the United States
ranked 31st for teen males and 22nd for females. Fatality rates for
U.S. male teenagers were more than twice the top-rated Sweden; U.S.
female fatality rates were 2 1/2 times those of the Netherlands.

HARD WORK, AD-LIB GEMS MADE `AMERICAN GRAFFITI' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS _ Where were you in '72? The cast and crew of
``American Graffiti'' were in northern California, shooting a
nostalgic little movie that would make history.
</P>
<P>
   The 1973 release _ its poster pitch line: ``Where were you in
'62?'' _ may be most notable as the project director George Lucas
did before ``Star Wars,'' but it got five Academy Award nominations
(including Best Picture), generated a superb soundtrack album,
introduced to the world a dazzling cast of young actors and may be
the most profitable movie ever made. Shot on a budget of $700,000,
it has generated total profits exceeding $50 million, which, in
today's movie-industry dollars, equals more than $1 bazillion.
</P>
<P>
   To read the old reviews, ``American Graffiti'' was mostly about
the loss of ``innocence,'' a cultural state of being so foreign now
as to be nearly mythical. To see it again is to remember that it
was also about the endless allure of cool American muscle cars, the
one-time omnipresence of Top 40 radio and that unobtainable blonde
in the fine, white T-bird.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, a 25th anniversary video and DVD release will offer
fans an opportunity to revisit Mel's Diner and its habitues. Some
of them, including Lucas, participated in a recent celebration of
the film sponsored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The event was a sellout, and a long line for standby tickets
wrapped around one side of the Academy's Wilshire Boulevard
headquarters. Inside, a pristine print of the film was screened,
then Lucas and his cast had a panel discussion, moderated by critic
Leonard Maltin.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dreyfuss, Harrison Ford, Ron Howard and Suzanne Somers _
the movie's actors who achieved the greatest fame _ weren't
present, though a host joked that Somers, who played that elusive
blonde, might occasionally be spotted peeking out of the projection
booth.
</P>
<P>
   Through one long last night of summer, ``American Graffiti''
told the story of friends ``on the verge of adulthood, about to
leave a special time,'' Maltin said. Lots of coming-of-age movies
came before, he continued, and a lot have come since.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Graffiti'' is the only film of all of them that
really went beneath the surface and caught something about what it
was really like.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Young filmmaker rules &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George Lucas spent the summer of '62 recovering from an auto
accident. A high school senior in Modesto, Calif., he was an
underachieving car nut who miraculously survived a two-car crash
that totaled his Fiat Bianchina.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, he had emerged from the University of Southern
California film school as a promising young writer and director,
and had already made his first feature, ``THX 1138.'' Lucas had
also alreadyapprenticed under and partnered with Francis Ford
Coppola, who had just released his masterwork, ``The Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola signed on to produce his buddy's next project _
described by Lucas as his ``rock `n' roll movie'' _ and proved most
valuable running interference between Lucas and Universal, the
sponsoring studio. (Maybe the music wasn't always so great in the
1970s, but young American filmmakers ruled the world.)
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' script (refined by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz) spun
the stories of four main characters into one seamless saga. The
four were the brainy future writer Curt (played by Dreyfuss),
clean-cut future insurance salesman Steve (Howard), aging
hot-rodder John (Paul Le Mat) and the lovable geek Terry ``The
Toad'' (Charles Martin Smith).
</P>
<P>
   Embedded in Lucas' main plot _ would Curt depart for college the
next morning with his pal Steve? _ were smaller lines coupling
members of the quartet with ominous characters like rival
hot-rodder Bob Falfa (Ford), greasy gang leader Joe (Bo Hopkins)
and some indelible females, including Steve's girlfriend Laurie
(Cindy Williams), morally flexible Debbie (Candy Clark) and kid
nuisance Carol (Mackenzie Phillips).
</P>
<P>
   Above it all howled Wolfman Jack, the fabled Mexican-radio disc
jockey, playing a non-stop soundtrack of songs from the '50s and
early '60s. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Casting trials  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Casting the film was ``agony'' for Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat in a little room and talked to people for five minutes
all day long, eight hours a day, for six months,'' he said. ``I
talked to every young person, I think, in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, most of the cast wasn't picked from those cattle-call
tryouts.
</P>
<P>
   A casting director spotted Phillips, the then-12-year-old
daughter of John Phillips of the Mamas and Papas, singing with her
teen band at the famed Troubadour nightclub in Hollywood. ``I was
this rock chick in my mind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark first met Lucas at one of the five-minute interviews, but
she showed up in a '50s costume and feared she'd blown her chance.
After seeing the script a few weeks later she begged for a second
chance, and eventually got to shoot a screen test, on a wooden park
bench simulating the front seat of a car, with Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd never get it,'' she said. ``I was taller than
Charlie.''
</P>
<P>
   Much later, Clark asked Lucas about the screen test (several of
the cast's tests will be included in a 25th anniversary DVD edition
of the film, which has a new, two-hour making-of documentary).
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Well, it came out black,' '' Clark said. ``I said,
`Why'd you hire me?' Then he said, `I liked what I saw through the
viewfinder.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams read the script and ``begged George to give me either
Mackenzie's part or Candy's part,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then 25, Williams screen-tested for the Laurie role with
``Ronny, as we called him until just a little while ago. And my
first thought was _ I loved Ronny, but _ `Oh my God, I'm going to
be kissing Opie.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, still an acting student at California State-Northridge,
had been in England during primary casting, but was spotted by
Lucas on the MGM studio lot just a few days before final screen
tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``George walked by, looked at me and said, `Are you an actor
person?' '' Smith said. ``I read the script and thought, `This is
really good writing. Nobody may notice it, but this could be really
good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Quinlan, who played the small part of Peg (Laurie's
ladies' room confidant), was actually a student at the Petaluma,
Calif., high school where those scenes were shot, and was
discovered in a cattle-call audition for extras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can watch that film and I can look in that gym where the
sock hop is and I can see my ex-gymnastics teammates,'' said
Quinlan, who would one day be nominated for a supporting actress
Oscar for ``Apollo 13,'' directed by Ron Howard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Month of all-nighters &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Filming ``American Graffiti'' proved no easier than casting it.
The limited budget allowed just 28 shooting days. Or, rather,
nights. The dusk-to-dawn story called for a month of all-nighters.
``I was tired most of the time,'' said Lucas, who often nodded off
during scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Filming in darkness was also a huge technical challenge. Advance
location scouts actually walked the streets of northern California
towns holding light meters to test the illumination provided by
street lamps. Lucas recalled that San Rafael, where the production
was based for the first few nights of the shoot, was much brighter
than Petaluma, where most of the filming occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Hair, and the special effects required to achieve the film's
greasy, pre-Beatles look, was obviously a preoccupation. ``They put
so much of that stuff in my hair, a fly just slid right off,''
Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was ``horrified'' by his greaser-geek hairstyle.
``George had to give me lessons on how to comb it. When I said, `My
hands are all greasy,' George said, `Wipe `em on your jeans, that's
what they're for.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I remember is how hard the actors worked,'' said
Smith. ``We took this movie really seriously. We'd sleep until 2 in
the afternoon, have something that resembled breakfast in the
Holiday Inn there, and then we'd all go to one room or another and
rehearse. We thought the movie had a chance to be good, and we
worked hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``These scenes are a combination of that and mistakes, all of
which George put in the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   One such scene was Ford's impromptu rendition of ``Some
Enchanted Evening.'' Snipped from the original release, the scene
was later restored by Lucas, who admitted to nodding off during the
scene. Another unscripted gem was a Dreyfuss contribution: Curt's
wistful attempt to remember the combination of his old school
locker.
</P>
<P>
   Smith recalled a spontaneous keeper from the drag-race scene, as
the Toad and John walk away from the crash. Lucas surprised the
actors by having them shoot the scene before they'd had a chance to
rehearse, or even fully learn their lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul and I did some acting-school improvisation,'' Smith said.
``One thing I could remember was that I had a line that had the
word `wheelchair' in it, but I couldn't remember the whole line. As
I'm walking back, I say, `The guy should get in a wheelchair and
roll home.' And I'm thinking, `What was that?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to George afterwards, and said, `I really screwed that
up.' And he said, `Oh, no! It was great!' And it was.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Studio haggling  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everybody was convinced of the film's potential.
``I remember flying home on weekends and rehearsing with Burt
Reynolds, who was doing ``White Lightning,'''said Hopkins. ``And I
thought that was going to be the biggie.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said Universal's executives at first thought ``American
Graffiti'' was ``unfit'' to release. Two legendarily successful
test screenings failed to fully win over the studio, which, Lucas
said, at one point proposed converting it to a TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   The director and the studio haggled for months over a
meaningless five-minute trim in the running time. (The film had
already been cut from a ``great'' three hours to less than two,
Lucas said. After ``Star Wars'' made Lucas one of the most powerful
figures in entertainment history, those five minutes were restored
and`` American Graffiti'' was re-released.)
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was at boarding school when ``American Graffiti'' was
first released. She returned in time to see it play in a theater
and quickly became one of its biggest fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went almost daily and I brought all my little friends with
me,'' said Phillips, who later struggled with well-publicized
substance-abuse problems. ``It opened a million doors for me, which
I promptly closed all by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   For many in the cast, the recent Academy screening was the first
time they'd seen the film in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as beautiful as I always remembered it,'' Williams said.
``I feel delighted and blessed that I'm a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remembered it was funny,'' said Le Mat. ``I remembered it
evoked this era, caught what it was like back then. But I had
forgotten how touching it was. Very touching.'' &QL;

MODERN VIKING SAILORS APPROACHING BAFFIN ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Viking-Row)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most treacherous part of the journey is nearly over.
</P>
<P>
   W. Hodding Carter and his nine-man crew, who are making a second
attempt to recreate Leif Ericsson's voyage to the New World, have
nearly completed the crossing of the Davis Strait. They were
expected to reach Baffin Island Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing in the Snorri, a 54-foot replica of a knarr, or Viking
ship, Carter and crew began the crossing eight days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The crossing, over 200 miles of open ocean, is the most
dangerous leg of the 1,500-mile voyage to Newfoundland from
Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, now that I've been doing this for four days, that
crossing the Davis Strait in an open boat is a crazy thing,''
Carter said by e-mail on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in attempting to make the same journey, the Snorri
lost a rudder in the middle of the Davis Strait and had to be towed
back to Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   The Maine-built Snorri is an open boat, powered only by oars and
a sail. It has no shelter below decks; crew members sleep under
tarps on deck. The boat is equipped with radios, a compass, a
global positioning system unit, and a laptop computer. Otherwise,
conditions on board closely mimic those of an actual Viking ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a huge range of conditions,'' said Carter, a
writer-adventurer from West Virginia and son of former State
Department spokesman Hodding Carter. ``Strong winds from the south,
strong winds from the north. Huge swells _ huge in an open boat at
least, because they were eight to 12 feet high and would send waves
of water right over the bow watch at 2 in morning _ my least
favorite job.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said his crew is ``holding up well, sleeping in shifts in
our little underway tarp. It's a little ripe in there from all the
spray and rain and sweat, but we barely notice it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Snorri left Nuuk, Greenland, on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're much closer'' to completing the voyage, ``and we seem to
be able to make tiny repairs as needed,'' Carter said. ``I don't
know what will happen, but I have complete confidence in our boat,
our captain, and our crew. This is a great experience, and it makes
the Viking accomplishments so much clearer and incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter and his crew hope to reach L'Anse aux Meadows,
Newfoundland _ identified as an early Viking settlement _ by
mid-September.

<P>
   Q. I work at a large department store where men are required to
wear sport coats or suits. The store gets extremely hot in places,
and I am not the only one complaining. Even the customers complain.
Management does not enforce the same rules for the women, and they
are allowed to wear nonbusiness attire such as dresses, short
skirts and open-toed shoes. What if I refuse to wear a jacket?
I.D. &QL; 
A. Unless you are looking for a heated confrontation with
management, your first option should not be to refuse to wear a
jacket. In addition, there are many who would dispute your point
about dresses and short skirts not being business attire, so that
too is not an avenue you should pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than seeing this as a problem, you should view it as an
opportunity. You should meet with management and present some
suggestions to deal with a source of dissatisfaction for a number
of employees and customers.
</P>
<P>
   Let management know that you and several of your associates
believe there is something wrong with the ventilation or air
conditioning, at least in your area of the store. Give specific
examples of the difficulties that this is causing, and then
indicate that you would like to be part of any plan to investigate
and correct this situation.
</P>
<P>
   It is safe to assume that all of your customers are not wearing
coats and ties, but many are still complaining about the heat. In a
word, it is the environment, not the dress code, that is causing so
many people to get hot and bothered. &QL; 
Q. In a meeting with my manager yesterday, he told me that he does
not think I have what it takes to be a good leader. Granted, I
haven't had much leadership experience, but I resent his comment
and I am not sure what to do from here. L.J. &QL; 
A. The more accurate message from your manager is that he does not
have what it takes to be a good leader. No good leader would make
that kind of comment.
</P>
<P>
   The most effective managers understand the importance of
coaching, guiding, and developing their employees. Such managers
work with their employees to establish realistic yet challenging
goals, and they provide their employees with constructive feedback
and numerous opportunities for two-way communication. None of this
sounds like your manager.
</P>
<P>
   The larger problem is that your manager has established an
expectation that you will not succeed as a leader, and this can
cause him to act in ways that fulfill this prophesy.
</P>
<P>
   If your objective is to move into management, it will be
important for you to develop your leadership skills, no matter who
your manager may be. In this regard, you should consider taking
classes and seminars, as well as participating in projects or
programs that place you in leadership roles, whether on the job or
in your community.
</P>
<P>
   There is no point in telling your manager right now that you
have what it takes to be a leader. Get some leadership expertise
and experience and let them do the talking. &QL; 
Q. I have an employee who always blames others for his mistakes. As
far as he is concerned, he is never at fault. How do you deal with
this type of person? S.D. &QL; 
A. For any number of reasons, this employee attaches grave
consequences to anything resembling a failure, and when one occurs,
he puts up his psychological deflector shield up so that the blame
will be bounced onto someone else. He has probably been allowed to
get away with this behavior for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does this behavior create problems for you as his
manager, and for whomever ultimately receives the blame that he has
deflected, it is also a problem for him. By denying responsibility
for his own failures, he is also denying himself the opportunity to
learn and grow from them. And, this means that he is destined to
repeat them.
</P>
<P>
   In order to deal with this behavior, one approach is for you to
work more closely with him, giving him appropriate feedback and
guidance to hopefully reduce the number of mistakes in the first
place. And, when he does make a mistake, give him some specific
feedback that identifies his behaviors that caused the error,
followed by some direction as to how the error could have been
prevented.
</P>
<P>
   Let him see that when errors are made, the key point is not
focused on blame. Rather, it is to try to identify what may have
caused the mistake, how to learn from it, and how to establish a
strategy to prevent it from occurring again.

ANALYSIS: MANY MOTIVES FOR CHINA NOT TO DEVALUE ITS CURRENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China's leaders have repeatedly promised not
to devalue the currency in the coming year. A broad array of
economists who understand the peculiar characteristics of China's
half-reformed economic system also say that it will not devalue.
</P>
<P>
   And yet nearly every day, markets around Asia seesaw sharply as
traders play on concerns that China will follow the path taken by
other Asian nations roiled by financial crisis and reduce the value
of its currency. The concerns have even reverberated outside Asia,
as investors fear that a Chinese devaluation would deepen the Asian
crisis, pulling down more markets with it.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, stock markets in Japan, South Korea, Singapore and
Thailand all fell. Traders and analysts cited worries that a
weakening Japanese yen would force Beijing to cave in on its
promise to remain a primary source of stability in the region.
Stocks in Hong Kong, which fell sharply last week, partly on
concern that a Chinese devaluation would affect the currency there,
rose slightly Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Such worries have echoed around Asia since the end of last year.
Yet it feeds on an analysis, as faulty then as it is now, that
fundamentally misunderstands basic tenets of political and economic
reality in China today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Zhu Rongji allows a devaluation, his political career is
over,'' an investment banker in Shanghai said of China's prime
minister. ``The political advantages of maintaining the currency
far outweigh the temporary advantages of devaluing.''
</P>
<P>
   While Chinese leaders, after their repeated pledges, now have a
political stake in maintaining the value of their currency _ the
yuan, also known as the renminbi _ there are some reasons for
Beijing to devalue. A weaker yuan could spur export growth at a
time that the economy is weakening, foreign investment is falling,
and millions of urban workers are facing unemployment. Chinese
exporters of steel and other products have started grumbling that
it will be hard to pay employee salaries without income.
</P>
<P>
   There are deeper reasons, however, for Beijing not to devalue.
China is in the middle of a wrenching shift from a state-run to a
market-driven economy, trying to sell the bulk of government-owned
industries, and about the last thing leaders in Beijing want is a
further cause of disruption.
</P>
<P>
   Making Chinese exports cheaper, many economists argue, is an
inefficient way to strengthen the economy. In the long run,
maintaining the currency makes economic sense by providing a stable
environment for investment, foreign and domestic.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing those imperatives from the beginning of the Asian
economic crisis, Chinese leaders decided they would maintain the
yuan's value for the time being, and have said so repeatedly. On
Sunday, President Jiang Zemin reasserted that stance strongly in a
meeting with Japan's foreign minister, Masahiko Komura.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Outsiders often overlook that China's economy is not yet fully
integrated with those of other trading nations. The Chinese
currency cannot be freely converted into foreign currencies, so
there is little immediate market pressure on the yuan. Exports
accounted for about 20 percent of the gross domestic product last
year, leaving the bulk of China's output domestic.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the decision-making process in Beijing is
heavily weighted toward political concerns, not market sensitivity.
Although China's leaders face lobbying from exporters, they seem to
stake far greater political capital on their promise not to
devalue.
</P>
<P>
   And devaluation might not give much of a boost to the nation's
already strong exports, which grew 5 percent in the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hu, executive director for Asian economic research at
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in Hong Kong, who predicts that no devaluation
will come for at least a year, argued that a change in China's
currency would not solve its sluggish export growth, primarily a
function of weakening demand in Southeast Asia, which will remain
weak regardless.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, China's foreign debt is manageable, and even though its
foreign-exchange reserves of $140 billion have begun to slip, they
are among the most substantial in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Of the worries that have buffeted Asian markets of late, the
concern that a falling Japanese yen is adding pressure to the
Chinese yuan is the most difficult to understand.
</P>
<P>
   There is little connection between the two currencies, said Dong
Tao, an economist who follows China for Credit Suisse in Hong Kong.
There is almost no overlap between Chinese and Japanese exports,
and while Japan bought about 20 percent of China's exports last
year, that was primarily in low-end clothing that is not very
sensitive to price changes.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders have adeptly used the falling yen to their
advantage, raising concern about the Asia-wide effects of unstable
currencies. The markets have interpreted such rumbling _
inaccurately, economists say _ as a sign that China would devalue
the yuan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese are legitimately saying to the U.S. and Japan:
You've got to straighten out the situation in Japan for the
stability of Asia,'' said John Pinkel, director of China research
at Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong. ``They're saying, you want us to
open our markets _ well, only when the overall picture is calmer.''
</P>
<P>
   In Shanghai Monday, currency traders said China's central bank
had intervened in the foreign-exchange market to hold the yuan at a
level of 8.28 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, the black market for dollars has risen to about
nine to the dollar, reflecting concern among ordinary Chinese that
a devaluation will eventually come. But that 9 percent discounting
of the currency is a far cry from the 250 percent difference
between the official and black-market exchange rates here a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, some economists say, falling demand for the yuan may
cause it to fall in value, but probably by less than 10 percent,
and not in any sweeping devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more likely that the Chinese currency will gradually
weaken,'' Pinkel of Merrill Lynch said. ``Demand for the renminbi
will fall. But there is no question of a sudden 30 percent
devaluation.''

   VINEYARD _ EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ When the Clintons come to Martha's
Vineyard next week, some local folks will pack up and leave their
beloved island until the First Family finishes its vacation. It's
not that they dislike President Clinton or even that they dread the
congestion and commotion that have accompanied him on three
previous late summer stays. But housing is scarce during August,
the seasonal peak, so some residents now rent their home to the
legions of Secret Service agents, White House staffers and
journalists who descend on the picturesque isle seven miles off

   BEVERLY HILLS - In retrospect, ``American Graffiti'' was a magic
moment; a bunch of young unknowns came together and made something
much bigger than themselves. Take a look at the family tree:
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second film for George Lucas, who later made the
``Star ``Wars'' trilogy and collaborated with Steven Spielberg on
the Indiana Jones'' film series. He's now working on the f irst of
a series of ``Star Wars'' prequels, which is expected to be
released next year.
</P>
<P>
   Candy Clark won an Academy Award nomination for playing Debbie,
Terry the Toad's dream girl. She later had roles in ``The Blob,''
``The Man Who Fell to Earth,'' ``Blue Thunder'' and ``Radioland
Murders.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dreyfuss moved on from Curt to ``The Apprenticeship of
Duddy Kravitz,'' ``Jaws,'' ``The Goodbye Girl,'' ``Close Encounters
of the Third Kind'' and ``Down and Out in Beverly Hills,' ' among
others.
</P>
<P>
   After Bob Falfa, Harrison Ford appeared in ``The Conversation,''
the ``Star ``Wars'' trilogy, the ``Indiana Jones'' movies, ``Blade
Runner,'' ``Working Girl,'' ``Air Force One'' and ``Six Days, Seven
Nights,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Hopkins was Joe, leader of the Pharaohs, and has since
appeared in ``The Getaway,'' ``The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing,''
``Midnight Express'' and ``U-Turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Before ``American Graffiti,'' Ron Howard starred in TV's ``The
Andy
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Show'' and the film ``The Music Man.'' After ``American
Graffiti,'' he starred in the ABC sitcom ``Happy Days'' and the
film ``The Shootist.'' As a director, he made ``Night Shift,''
``Splash,'' ``Cocoon,'' ``Backdraft,'' ``Apollo 13'' and
``Ransom,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   After his role as John, Paul Le Mat made his mark as Melvin
Dummar in ``Melvin and Howard.'' He also stars in the upcoming
films ``The Outfitters'' and ``American History X.''
</P>
<P>
   After playing Carol, Mackenzie Phillips starred as Julie Cooper
in the TV series ``One Day at a Time,'' and toured with her dad's
pop group, The Mamas and the Papas. Recently, she has appeared in
the musical ``Grease.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Quinlan made her debut as Peg in ``American Graffiti,''
and has since starred in ``The Doors,'' ``Apollo 13,''
``Breakdown'' and ``My Giant.''
</P>
<P>
   After Terry the Toad, Charles Martin Smith worked in
``Starman,'' ``The Buddy Holly Story'' and the ``Untouchables.'' In
1983 he co-wrote and starred in ``Never Cry Wolf.'' More recently,
he directed the premiere episode of the TV series ``Buffy, the
Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   After her big break as Curt's Teen Angel, Suzanne Somers starred
on the ABC sitcom ``Three's Company,'' then in countless
made-for-TV movies, attempted TV series and fitness infomercials.
She now co-hosts the CBS series ``Candid Camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Williams was Laurie, then Shirley in the hit ABC sitcom
``Laverneand Shirley.'' She also starred in the Francis Ford
Coppola film ``The Conversation,'' and appeared in the films ``Fat
her of the Bride I and II'' and ``Meet Wally Sparks.'' &QL;

`AMERICAN GRAFFITI' SOUNDTRACK PUT THE WRITING ON THE WALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS - Once, a full soundtrack made entirely of pop
hits was unthinkable. But to George Lucas, who had written the
original draft of the ``American Graffiti'' screenplay by matching
scenes to specific songs from his personal record collection, the
story couldn't be told any other way.
</P>
<P>
   Music licensing ultimately ate more than 10 percent of the
film's already-tiny budget.
</P>
<P>
   During the recent Motion Picture Academy panel, Lucas said a
music official at Universal once suggested saving on licensing fees
by having an orchestra re-record the original records Lucas had
suggested. He also noted that no Elvis tunes made the soundtrack
because his record company, RCA, wouldn't cut a deal.
</P>
<P>
   According to Geoff Mayfield, director of music charts for
``Billboard'' magazine, the ``American Graffiti'' two-LP soundtrack
went triple platinum (more than 3 million sold) and spawned two
sequels. The or iginal stayed on the ``Billboard'' album charts for
60 weeks, peaking at No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been bigger soundtracks,'' Mayfield said. ``But
this is not an embarrassing thing, to have these old '50s hits
chart well in '73.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, before ``American Graffiti,'' film soundtracks
generally didn't sell in such numbers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the sales charts compiled by author Joel Whitburn
in the book ``Top Pop Albums 1955-1996,'' the only smash
soundtracks to predate ``American Graffiti'' were from movies based
on Broadway shows (such as ``Oklahoma!'' and ``West Side Story``)
and the score for Franco Zeffirelli's ``Romeo and Juliet.``
</P>
<P>
   Albums taken from movies starring the Beatles did pretty well,
too, but ``American Graffiti'' pioneered the
soundtrack-as-ancillary-product concept later exploited for films
like ``Saturday Night Fever,`` ``Urban Cowboy,`` ``Flashdance'' and
``The Bodyguard.` ` &QL;

CLINTON'S TV PRODUCER FRIEND TO TESTIFY IN FRONT OF GRAND JURY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Less that a week before President Clinton is to
tell a grand jury about his relationship with a former White House
intern, prosecutors prepared to question a presidential friend,
television producer Harry Thomason.
</P>
<P>
   Thomason was scheduled to appear Tuesday at the U.S. District
Courthouse where independent counsel Kenneth Starr is overseeing
the grand jury inquiry into whether the president tried illegally
to cover-up an alleged extra-marital affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old sit-com producer is an Arkansas native who
befriended Clinton earlier in his political career. In January,
Thomason was summoned by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to help
advise the president shortly after Starr launched his investigation
and the public learned of the White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's team of prosecutors wants to question Thomason about any
private talks he had with Clinton concerning Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Thomason reportedly coached Clinton before he issued his
nationally televised, finger-wagging denial of a sexual affair with
Lewinsky on Jan. 26. In addition to spending the early days of the
scandal inquiry at the White House, Thomason and his wife, Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason, spent a long weekend in February with the
Clintons at Camp David, the presidential retreat.
</P>
<P>
   While in Washington to testify before Starr's grand jury, it was
uncertain whether Thomason would stay in town long enough to meet
with Clinton about the president's pending session with the panel
via closed-circuit television. The president, who has agreed to
answer prosecutor's questions Aug. 17, was scheduled to be in
California until early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Lewinsky told the grand jury that contrary to sworn
denials in January by the president, her relationship with Clinton
involved a dozen sexual encounters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying with an agreement that she would not be prosecuted
unless it was proved that she lied, Lewinsky also told grand jurors
that she and Clinton discussed ``cover stories'' or ways to conceal
their relationship, a legal source said. The discussions included
how to return gifts she had received from the president by routing
them through his personal secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Thomason was linked to the firings in the White House
travel office. He had contacted the Clintons on behalf of a
Cincinnati-based consulting firm seeking a contract for some of the
travel business associated with the president's travels. Thomason
and his wife, who held a minority interest in the consulting firm,
were criticized for trying to use their White House contacts for
personal gain.

MORE STATES USING WAGE REBATES TO LURE COMPANIES

 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the 1950s, state governments have lured corporations with
expensive incentives such as free factories, canceled property
taxes, low-interest loans, free access roads and special tax
credits. Now in the 1990s, the competition among states and even
Mexico to attract companies has spawned a new incentive, one
strikingly uncharacteristic for a free-market economy: wage
rebates.
</P>
<P>
   Wage rebates allow companies to lower their labor costs through
taxpayer-financed subsidies. For each job created by a relocated or
existing company, a state reimburses the company for part of the
wages paid. These subsidies, offered by only eight states in 1989,
are now offered by 21 states, mostly in the South and Midwest,
according to the Council of State Governments, a research group
financed by the states.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Whirlpool, which opened a stove factory in Tulsa,
Okla., two years ago and hired more than 1,100 workers. For 10
years, it will get back 4.5 cents of every dollar paid in wages to
those workers.
</P>
<P>
   In all, nearly 1 million jobs appear to be covered by the
rebates, judging from the few states that report new jobs. In some
states, including Oklahoma and Ohio, the wage subsidy has become
the single most expensive corporate lure. It is costing Ohio
taxpayers more than $25 million a year. In other states, including
New Jersey, North Carolina and Maine, it is the fastest-growing
corporate incentive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wage rebates have become a very important modern-era incentive
for companies,'' said Joseph Kramer, vice president for economic
development of the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce. ``And
they are pay as you go, much more than other incentives. A company
does not get the rebate until after the new worker is actually on
the payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   When wage rebates began to spread in the mid-1990s, the
unemployment rate was higher than it is today, and states were
struggling to generate new jobs. Now, a robust economy is
generating millions of new jobs, pushing the unemployment rate to
its lowest level in decades. That is raising questions about the
value of taxpayer-financed wage rebates, which increasingly reward
companies for creating jobs they would have created anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is whether, in a tight labor market, these
rebates have turned into a windfall for the companies,'' said Van
Doorn Ooms, research director of the Committee for Economic
Development, a research group supported by business. ``In a
high-unemployment situation, wage rebates are useful as a stimulus
for creating jobs. In a tight labor market, they are more likely to
simply pass on some of the cost of labor to the taxpayer from the
employer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Gold shares that view, although he does not put it that
bluntly. Mitchell Gold Co., which he owns, makes upholstered
furniture in Taylorsville, N.C. _ furniture sold through Pottery
Barn and Crate and Barrel stores. With business thriving, Gold
decided to expand a year ago. He looked into the incentives
available from North Carolina and found that his company qualified
for a wage rebate.
</P>
<P>
   So for the 80 workers being added to the company's 250-member
work force, Mitchell Gold will get back a portion of the state
income taxes withheld from each employee's check for four years.
The rebate is equal to roughly 2 percent of the typical worker's
annual pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly I would have stayed in North Carolina and expanded
without the wage rebate,'' Gold said, ``but in a competitive,
labor-intensive business, every little bit helps.''
</P>
<P>
   The subsidies are almost always restricted to manufacturers and
high-end service companies that bring ``good jobs'' to a state;
that is, jobs paying more than $7.50 an hour. The Oklahoma rebate
law, for example, applies only to jobs that pay at least $9 an hour
and carry health insurance benefits. Temporary workers are ruled
out. So are people who move to the state for the new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Such rules let the states alter the marketplace in a form of
industrial policy much criticized by those who advocate a reduced
role for government. ``We are becoming more regulated at the state
level even as we become less so at the federal level,'' said John
Bishop, a Cornell University labor economist.
</P>
<P>
   Mimicry plays a big role in the spread of wage subsidies. The
Maryland Legislature, for example, enacted a subsidy in 1996 and
expanded it last year to cover more industries because neighboring
Virginia had such a subsidy. Similarly, the Ohio Legislature
quickly followed Kentucky's lead in 1992, prodded by the Greater
Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce, which feared that companies would
choose to build in Cincinnati's suburbs on the Kentucky side of the
Ohio River.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio will soon have 100,000 jobs covered by wage rebates, state
officials say. And Kentucky is moving up quickly, having recently
agreed to rebate a portion of the wages for 6,000 jobs that United
Parcel Service is creating at a distribution hub being built in
Louisville. UPS officials have pointed to the wage credits,
totaling $3.5 million a year for 10 years, as a key reason for
choosing Kentucky for the new hub. And such thinking pops up
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to have a wage-reimbursement program today is a terrible
thing,'' said Jerry Wade, a research economist at the Department of
Business and Economic Development in Maryland. ``When Virginia
adopted a wage subsidy next door, we found ourselves telling
companies that we would have one, too. The perception was that
Virginia, because of its subsidy, had a better overall business
climate than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico also looms in the equation. Oklahoma's subsidy, lowering
the cost of labor, led Whirlpool to put its stove factory in Tulsa
rather than in another state or in northern Mexico, where the
company already has factories.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``We had four states and Mexico under consideration, and
Oklahoma gave us the Quality Jobs Act,'' as the wage-rebate
legislation is known, said Thomas Vining, a Whirlpool vice
president. ``That incentive, along with another incentive, were the
tie-breakers.'' The second incentive was a diversion of the county
sales tax revenue for a year to pay for construction of the
Whirlpool factory.
</P>
<P>
   The wage reimbursements take several forms. Some states, like
Ohio, offer a credit against corporate income taxes, and if the
corporate tax is not sufficient, they send out checks to cover the
difference. Other states cap the reimbursement. The state income
tax provides the other most common way of handling the rebates. In
this version, states return to the company a portion of the taxes
withheld from qualified employees at the end of each year.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the mechanism, officials in states with the rebates
increasingly argue that they are the most efficient incentive in
creating jobs. Unlike the other incentives _ investment tax
credits, for example, or state-financed factory construction _ no
taxpayer money goes for wage rebates until the jobs exist. Even
then, the jobs must last for a certain number of years or the
companies must give back the rebates.
</P>
<P>
   In many states, a company must create 25 jobs a year to qualify
for a rebate. Maryland has set the minimum at 60, pointedly
undercutting the 100-job requirement in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view wage reimbursement as revenue neutral,'' said Lisa
Cruz, spokeswoman for the Department of Commerce and Economic
Development in New Jersey, the only state in the New York
metropolitan area that has adopted the rebates. In the two years
since New Jersey began to provide rebates, some 30,000 new jobs
have qualified for the credit, which goes as high as $3,800 a year
for a single $75,000-a-year employee. ``These workers,'' Ms. Cruz
said, ``generate sales taxes and corporate income taxes that would
not otherwise have existed.''
</P>
<P>
   Such big corporations as Raytheon, Hewlett-Packard and
Bristol-Myers Squibb, having put new operations in New Jersey over
the last two years, are now receiving wage rebates for more than
1,700 of their employees, all of them earning the minimum of $7.73
an hour required by New Jersey law, or 150 percent of the federal
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Competition with nearby Maryland played a role in Gov. Christie
Whitman's decision to ask the Legislature for a wage rebate
program. ``Our strategy has been to tie state-funded incentives
directly to the creation of good jobs,'' said Gil Medina, secretary
of the Department of Commerce and Economic Development in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Wage subsidies have existed for years in a different form, as
part of a social welfare program. In these programs, companies
receive wage rebates to create jobs in inner cities and other areas
of high unemployment or hire people on welfare, ex-felons and
others who have trouble finding work. More than 40 states offer
such wage rebates, usually in the form of a tax credit, as does the
federal government. The programs aim to help the disadvantaged, who
would otherwise not have jobs, even in tight labor markets.
</P>
<P>
   California, New York and Connecticut have such programs, arguing
in effect that taxpayer-financed wage subsidies should be aimed at
encouraging employment of the needy and not employment of people
who are already sufficiently skilled to be attractive to
corporations. The legislatures of these three states have never
enacted wage rebates for high-skilled, high-wage jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not had to take that step,'' said Chris Holben, an
under secretary of trade and commerce in California. ``Yes, we are
constantly told by companies considering California that other
states will give them a wage rebate, and why not us. We believe the
package of incentives that we do offer is sufficient. And we have a
strategic advantage: We serve the Pacific Rim and the Mexican
market.''
</P>
<P>
   At the national level, Congress enacted a broad wage rebate
program in 1976, like those now proliferating among the states. The
program was intended to stimulate job creation in the wake of the
mid-1970s recession. To qualify, a company had to increase its
employment by 2 percent in a single year. If it did, it received a
corporate income tax credit equal to half of the first $4,200 of
each new worker's wages.
</P>
<P>
   The program did generate jobs, according to a study done by
Bishop of Cornell. But it was phased out after two years as too
expensive, having cost $4.5 billion in 1978 alone.
</P>
<P>
   The wage rebates and all the other incentives used by states to
entice companies face a similar criticism today. ``We are funneling
tens of billions of dollars into shifting jobs from one state to
another,'' said Charles Horn, a Republican state senator in Ohio.
``That money should be going to schools and roads and other public
outlays that would make states truly more competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives has before it a bill, introduced by
Rep. David Minge, D-Minn., that would force corporations to declare
as income all the state incentive payments they receive each year.
These would then be taxed at the federal level. Arthur Rolnick,
research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis,
supports the measure, and even goes a step further. He wants state
incentive payments outlawed as illegal obstacles to interstate
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has the authority,'' he said, ``under the commerce
clause of the Constitution to end this war between the states.''

CRITIC'S CHOICE: DIVIDED BY CENTURIES, UNITED IN FUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``John's Book of Alleged Dances,'' the name of the set of pieces
for string quartet on the latest album of music by John Adams
(Elektra Nonesuch 75455), could have been used as the title for
either of two new CDs as a whole. Adams' other piece, his clarinet
concerto ``Gnarly Buttons,'' is just as allegedly danceable, and no
doubt it will soon be danced in reality, just as the quartet book
has been taken up by the Paul Taylor Company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gnarly Buttons'' is thoroughly enjoyable and at the same time
shows its composer continuing to grow. Much of the first movement
is a wandering unison line, with the solo clarinet present most of
the way, joined in patches by members of the accompanying ensemble
on a deliberately disjointed, often countryish array of
instruments: two reeds, trombone, string quintet, banjo (doubling
on mandolin and guitar) and two samplers (alternating on pianos).
The line takes off from a hymn tune, and travels, fractal wise,
through figures that are always similar but never quite the same.
</P>
<P>
   The middle movement is a hoedown with one bellowing ``moo,'' a
reference to the troubles in British cattle farming at the time of
the first performance, which was given by Michael Collins and the
London Sinfonietta in October 1996. (This recording is by the same
musicians, with Collins a splendid soloist, engaging and athletic.)
Finally comes an adieu something like Chou's concluding song in
Adams' opera, ``Nixon in China,'' but with the tune going up into
the air near the end and waving its legs furiously.
</P>
<P>
   The quartet set, played by the Kronos Quartet, is a looser
collection with some cross-references to the later ``Gnarly
Buttons.'' For example, most of the pieces are again fractal-like
in the omnipresence of similarity without sameness: motifs are
rearranged, beats shift and seemingly repetitive patterns keep
shifting their ground. Also, the fourth alleged dance, ``Pavane:
She's So Fine,'' already knows about the hoedown theme.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Philippe Rameau is the other John, whose alleged dances, in
the spectacular new recording by Nicholas McGegan and his
Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra (Conifer 75605 51313), come from two
of his operas: ``Platee'' and ``Dardanus.'' Across the gap of a
quarter of a millennium there is a lot in common between the two
Johns. One shared trait is a love of vernacular music, whether
represented by hoedowns and ballads or drone-based musettes and
drum-accented tambourins. No doubt connected with this is a love,
too, of syncopation, the ``Passepieds'' from ``Platee'' being just
as exciting as what Adams gets up to. Above all, both composers are
evidently having fun.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two Rameau suites, the most extraordinary movements come
from ``Platee'' and include a dance with monotonous croaks (as of
frogs), an exciting storm scene and a number in which slow and fast
music go on at the same time. But everything sounds wonderful in
these whipcrack performances, full of color and nuance.

EMC ACQUIRES CONLEY CORP. 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Underscoring its commitment to build a larger software business,
EMC Corp. has acquired Conley Corp., a small software firm.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, while valued at less than $50 million, is of strategic
importance to EMC as it seeks to expand its lead in the market for
giant computer storage networks that help companies manage huge
volumes of information.
</P>
<P>
   EMC's sales and profits have been growing more than 30 percent a
year, partly because of the rapid growth of its software business.
EMC has developed nearly a dozen value-added software programs as a
way to stay ahead of competitors in the storage equipment business
such as IBM and Hitachi.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, EMC's software sales more than doubled to $177
million and software revenue is expected to hit $400 million this
year, making making EMC one of the fastest-growing major software
companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Conley's Cambridge, Mass. operations, which employ about 50
workers, will be renamed the EMC Cambridge Software Development
Center, and will serve as a recruiting base for talented software
engineers who aren't interested in commuting to EMC's Hopkinton,
Mass. headquarters, said company spokesman Mark Fredrickson.
</P>
<P>
   Ric Calvillo, Conley's founder and president, will be general
manager of the new software development center, which will also
host other EMC software operations over time.
</P>
<P>
   Conley specializes in high-availability, high-performance
storage management software for UNIX, Windows NT and other
platforms. The two companies collaborated on the development of EMC
PowerPath software, which was introduced in February and has
quickly become the fastest-growing product in EMC's stable of
software programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``EMC and Conley share a common view of information-centric
computing, in which intelligent enterprise storage will continue to
play an increasingly strategic role for large organizations that
depend on information to run their businesses'' EMC's chief
executive, Michael C. Ruettgers, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, two other Conley executives, Jean Hamilton and Kuo
Hsieh, announced formation of a new company, Lexias Inc., based in
New York. Lexias will provide ongoing sales, support and service
for current Conley storage customers, and will also expand its
scope beyond data protection to encompass such emerging markets as
Internet security.

PARTY INFIGHTING HOBBLING REPUBLICAN EFFORTS IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in Congress left for their summer
vacation last week deeply divided, fighting themselves as hard as
they fought Democrats, and unable to fill the policy vacuum left by
the hobbled Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   With only one month left in the Congressional session before
mid-term elections that could decide control of the House,
Republicans in both Houses have been unable to agree on a budget.
They are squabbling over tax cuts. They have yet to send the White
House even one of the 13 spending bills needed to keep the
government running when the new fiscal year begins in October.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans now say they may not move forward with their
own scaled-back antismoking bill, which they promised when the
Senate legislation to regulate tobacco died. ``Trying to craft a
bill that will garner a majority has been elusive,'' said Rep. John
Boehner of Ohio, chairman of the House Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, the divisions among social conservatives,
Republican moderates and the party's business wing have resulted in
high-profile broken promises and stalled spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Even tax cuts no longer seem to be the unifying force they once
were for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich sent his rank and file home with
instructions to gin up a public outcry in August for a House
Republican plan to devote $700 billion of a projected $1.5 trillion
federal surplus over the next decade to tax cuts and dedicate the
remaining surplus to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But the tactic seemed as much about putting pressure on Senate
Republicans who balk at the proposal as it was about staking out
ground against the Democrats for the midterm election.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the American people learn about the size of the
surplus,'' Gingrich said on Friday, ``when the American people
learn about the power of economic growth to save Social Security,
when the American people learn about what we're proposing to do, I
am confident that by September you will see virtually all of the
senators on the Republican side in favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders are adamantly opposed to tax cuts of such
magnitude this year, and since the first days of the 1995
Republican revolution, the Republican Senate has usually been wary
of the sweeping changes sought by the Republican House. Gingrich
has conceded to other House members that, partly because of this
stance, the House may end up getting only about $70 billion in tax
cuts this year.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the problems facing the Republicans are endemic to
Congressional parties without a president to articulate an
overarching message. Making matters worse for the Republicans is
Clinton's skill at stealing their rhetoric, leaving them flummoxed
with little to oppose. And not only do the Republicans lack one
dominant figure, their Congressional leadership is hampered by one
of the smallest House majorities this century.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans say the party lost the unifying ideas that
allowed the disparate elements of the Republican coalition to unite
in the past _ anticommunism and the battle to erase the federal
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   And so elements of the party check, or perhaps checkmate, each
other.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has stalled legislation sought by social
conservatives but opposed by business that would require sanctions
against nations that practice religious persecution.
</P>
<P>
   And despite Gingrich's pledge to business groups that he would
push in July for financing for the International Monetary Fund, the
House abruptly put the issue off until September, with Rep. Dick
Armey, R-Texas, Gingrich's second in command, leading the battle
against the money.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd pose for a party that once projected itself as
internationalist, Armey recently took pride in his lack of interest
in foreign travel. ``I've been to Europe once,'' he said. ``I don't
have to go again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., recently called the split between his
party's business and social conservative wings ``terribly
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It could undermine our party,'' he said. ``It could defeat us
in 2000 if we don't put our party back together.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Democrats _ accusing the Republicans of running a
``do-nothing Congress'' _ are hoping the Republican infighting can
be turned to their advantage in their struggle to retake the House.
And they underscore the lack of action constantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Bart Simpson Congress _ underachievers and proud of
it,'' House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri said as
the House left for August. ``Instead of working to address the real
challenges, which most American families face, the Republicans
continue to run out the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   But voters, when asked which party they would prefer to lead
Congress, have put the two at a tie for months. And Democrats say
surveys earlier this year by two White House pollsters, Mark Penn
and Douglas Schoen, found that the public did not necessarily think
a do-nothing Congress was bad _ as long as the economy was good.
</P>
<P>
   So the Democrats are trying to highlight particular issues to
show voters what it means to them if Congress has a scaled-back
agenda. Their list of legislation left undone includes an
antitobacco measure, a bill regulating health maintenance
organizations, overhauling the campaign finance system and spending
increases for education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, House Republicans and Democrats each seemed to be
spoiling for precisely the political confrontation that most scares
Senate Republicans _ a debate over whether the Republicans'
proposal for a large tax cut would risk the long-term health of
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   That allows each party to play to its traditional strengths.
``We will fight together to make sure Republicans don't betray our
obligation to Social Security and the American people,'' Gephardt
said. ``If that's what they want to run on, that's good. Let's
engage.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, anticipating the Democratic line of attack, said that
under current economic projections of the surplus, a tax cut of
$700 billion would still leave $761 billion over 11 years to be set
aside for Social Security. ``They want to keep all the money in
Washington, frankly, so they can spend it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The entire political mood could change in the fall, depending on
the investigation of Whitewater and Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel. That in
turn could have some effect on whether Clinton and the Congress
hurtle to another government shutdown instead of reaching an
agreement on tax cuts and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans last week, after receiving a veto threat from the
White House on seven spending bills, preemptively began accusing
the administration of seeking such a confrontation as a diversion
from Clinton's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich himself was cautious about predicting the session's
outcome. ``In my judgment,'' he said, ``we'll get something done
this fall unless the whole place melts down.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. JOSEPH, Mo. _ Five years ago at Christmas time, John
Gonzalez, a munitions specialist with the Defense Department, took
his teen-age son, Marco, for a haircut in their new hometown of
Albuquerque, N.M. While they were waiting, a quartet of a cappella
singers came in to entertain the customers with carols, wringing an
irresistible sentiment from the familiar holiday music.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they were leaving, I grabbed the smallest guy in the
quartet and said, `Hey is that something my boy and I could do?'''
Gonzalez recalled between classes at Harmony College, a weeklong
intensive study program in ``barbershopping,'' the art of
old-fashioned four-part harmony singing. ``And that was that.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Gonzalezes, that day in Albuquerque was, as
barbershoppers say, the hook; they've been harmonizing ever since.
And though they are unusual for coming upon barbershop singing in
an actual barbershop, their story of hearing the music and being
instantly smitten is typical, at least within the society of men to
which they now belong.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement
of Barbershop Quartet Singing in America (SPEBSQSA), which is 60
years old and, with more than 34,000 members in 809 chapters in
this country and Canada, may well be the largest singing
organization in the world. Its independently run sister, Sweet
Adelines International, claims a female membership of 29,000.
</P>
<P>
   The society, as members call it (trying to pronounce the acronym
is officially discouraged), is a fraternal organization of
``congenial men of good character who love harmony in music or have
a desire to harmonize,'' as it is written in the group's code of
ethics. Based in Kenosha, Wis., it has an annual budget of $5.5
million, which it uses to hold competitions, publish a magazine,
run educational programs and support amateur singing groups. But
more than that, it is a group of ardent, amateur hobbyists _ most
do not read music _ true believers, devoted to a kind of gospel.
``We believe,'' members are wont to say, ``that you can't be
unhappy when you're singing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, barbershop singing is the proverbial way of life, said
Darryl Flinn, a former insurance executive who is the society's
executive director. ``Singing is what we do, but you cannot ignore
the fraternal and familial aspect of what we do,'' he said. ``The
music brings us together. I'll bet I know 10,000 barbershoppers in
this country by their first names.''
</P>
<P>
   Each summer, the society sponsors Harmony College at Western
Missouri State College here, and this year's program had some 600
participants of varying skill and experience, as young as
12-year-old Nicky Papageorge from Los Angeles and as old as
95-year-old Dean Snyder from Alexandria, Va. Snyder delivered the
opening night address, strumming the ukulele that first got him
interested in music in 1918 and telling his fellow harmonizers,
``If there's a song in our hearts, we can never grow old.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to attending daily classes in subjects like history
of barbershop, voice analysis, vocal techniques, theory of harmony
and arranging for barbershop voices, they sang in choruses and in
quartets. They gathered in hallways to sing ``polecat songs'' _ the
dozen officially designated classics (like ``My Wild Irish Rose''
and ``Wait Till the Sun Shines, Nellie'') that all society members
have memorized, like a secret handshake.
</P>
<P>
   They engaged in ``woodshedding,'' their term for improvisation.
They practiced ``swipes,'' embellishments at the ends of lines that
push a song forward, connecting lines musically in the absence of
instrumental accompaniment. They sang ``tags,'' ends of songs that,
with their suspended chords giving way to satisfying resolutions,
give barbershoppers their most intense pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   They ate meatball sandwiches and chipped beef on toast in the
dining hall and gathered each night at 10 for mammoth bowls of ice
cream. The sense of ritual was palpable, and as part of it, the
more than 100 first-timers among them, like the Gonzalezes, had to
walk the campus wearing red or blue helicopter beanies, at least
until midweek, when they held a sing-off. The winning team got to
discard the beanies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been singing seven years,'' said Stephen Ray, 35, a
systems analyst for the Ford Motor Company in Detroit who was
wearing a blue beanie. ``I wish I could say it was 15 or 20, but
when I went to high school, we all thought the guys in the choir
were sissies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he had gone to a performance by the local society
chapter with a co-worker. ``They were having so much fun onstage
that, afterward, when they invited everyone to audition, I did, and
I've been going ever since,'' he said. ``I sing every day now. You
get the tunes in your head, and you can't them out.'' He paused for
a moment to sing the lead part on a tag: ``We'll just be the same
old friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it's all about,'' he said. ``It's more than
singing. We really have good fellowship.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Barbershop singing is generally defined as unaccompanied
four-part harmony with arrangements built around dominant seventh
chords _ that is, with the top note of a major chord dropped a full
step. (An F-major chord, for example is F-A-C-F; the dominant
seventh is F-A-C-E flat.). Also known as a barbershop seventh, it
produces a sweet, straining sound that tilts forward, propelling a
song toward a resolution to the major chord needed by the ear.
``Ringing a chord'' is what barbershoppers live for.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's rolling the right way and you hit a certain chord,
you just want to sit back and smile,'' said Marco Gonzalez, now 20.
``It's like falling in love. You don't know why it happens. You
just have to acknowledge it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike that of choral singing, the melody in barbershop singing
is carried in the second voice, called the lead. The top voice, the
tenor, generally sings at an interval of a third above the lead;
the bass supplies the resonant bottom and the rhythmic foundation,
and the third voice, the baritone, is the junk man, ranging above
and below the lead, filling whatever hole the arrangement has left
in the chord. By lore, baritones are flakes, the butt of barbershop
humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the red beanies ready yet?'' asked Ev Nau, the society
official who was M.C. for the midweek competition among the
rookies. ``Do they realize today's Wednesday? Or are they all
baritones?''
</P>
<P>
   The musical root of barbershop singing is said to date to the
16th century in Europe, where composers first developed the
dominant seventh chord and other harmonies. The best guess as to
the origin of the music's association with barbershops is that
barbers, who at that time also performed medical and dental
functions and were often among the best educated citizens of a
town, ``were frequently skilled musicians,'' said David Wright, a
society historian. ``Patrons would sing while they waited.'' The
term barber's music, meaning incidental or spontaneous singing,
occurs in the 17th-century diaries of Samuel Pepys.
</P>
<P>
   Quartet singing in four-part harmony was an American invention,
sometime before 1850, and quartets became fixtures in minstrel
shows, singing gospel and, increasingly, contemporary popular songs
by the likes of Stephen Foster. Helped by Edison's invention of the
phonograph, quartet singing flourished during the era of
vaudeville. By 1910, ``barbershop'' had become associated with
seventh-chord harmony. The early 1900s, just before the advent of
Scott Joplin's ragtime and the more complicated, more
difficult-to-harmonize songs of 20th-century composers like Irving
Berlin, are generally thought of as barbershopping's golden age.
</P>
<P>
   The society was founded in 1938, when Owen Cash, a lawyer, and
Rupert Hall, a businessman, both from Tulsa, Okla., crossed paths
in the Muehlebach Hotel in Kansas City, Mo. They began singing
together in the piano lounge, and shortly afterward organized a
meeting of aspiring harmonizers back in Tulsa. By June 1 of that
year, there were 63 members of SPEBSQSA, a name concocted by Cash
as a swipe at the spate of governmental acronyms _ TVA, WPA _ that
proliferated in the era of, well, FDR.
</P>
<P>
   By 1950, membership nationwide was more than 26,000. For the
society today, the biggest problems are the graying membership _
although 42 attendees of Harmony College were under 24, the median
age of the Society is about 55 _ and the struggle to diversify.
Although the Gonzalezes are of Mexican and American Indian descent,
the organization is overwhelmingly white, which officials
acknowledge is a function of both reputation and repertory. The
music at the core of barbershopping derives from the Jim Crow era,
after all, and the society's original charter restricted membership
to white men. The clause was rewritten in 1962, but the image is
hard to shake, and society officials say they feel frustrated in
their efforts to attract members of other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've deviled ourselves with that very question for 10
years,'' said Flinn, the executive director. ``We have created a
minority outreach program, and we have to be careful because a lot
of our music comes from the time of slavery and is just not
appropriate. We'd like to get beyond the stigma and have a good
racial mix.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some irony in this. Black quartets in the 19th century
were among the first to feature barbershop-style harmonies, and the
style has clear ties to many black musical idioms, from gospel to
doo-wop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the music most black people know is not in this
style,'' said Farris Collins, who is black, a barbershopper and a
high school music teacher from Albuquerque who was a vocal
techniques instructor at Harmony College. ``The kids just aren't
that excited about it. For many of them, it just isn't funky
enough.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, funky it ain't. The society has only just begun to
accept more rhythmically inventive music as part of the barbershop
canon, by which it means swing-era songs like ``Sentimental
Journey.'' Until a few years ago, a quartet performing a song
featuring syncopated rhythms in a competition would be penalized. A
popular arrangement of ``Hello, Mary Lou,'' the 1960s Rick Nelson
song, is a relatively new innovation in the barbershop world.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the songs are too schmaltzy for most people,'' said
David Wright, who in addition to being an amateur historian,
arranger and singer, makes his living as a mathematics professor at
Washington University in St. Louis. But like a lot of singers here,
he acknowledged that spiritually and even sensually the music
delivers a thrill _ not to hear it so much as to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about this music that is for the
gratification of the singer,'' he said. Indeed, watching a roomful
of men singing tags, ringing chords so that emotion hums through
the room, one can't help sense in them a kind of ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you a true story,'' said Ron Black, a computer
programmer from Fresno, Calif. In San Francisco a few years ago, he
said, after a competition, a lead, a tenor and a baritone were
walking down the street and were approached by a prostitute. ``She
said to a guy, `Hey you want to have some fun?''' Black said. ``And
the guy actually said, `Oh, do you sing bass?'''

WHITE HOUSE HOPES NEW BOGOTA GOVERNMENT WILL LEAD TO IMPROVED
RELATIONS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration says the inauguration of
President Andres Pastrana of Colombia should mean the end of years
of ill will between his nation and the United States, especially if
he moves quickly on a pledge to stem the flood of Colombian cocaine
into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana was sworn in on Friday, less than a week after
returning from Washington, where he met with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's decision to offer Pastrana a
pre-inauguration meeting at the White House was in stark contrast
to its treatment of his predecessor, Ernesto Samper, who was denied
a travel visa to the United States after evidence indicated that a
drug cartel had provided $6 million for his 1994 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that during his meeting with
Clinton, Pastrana, 43, a Conservative, had promised that he would
try to shut down drug trafficking operations in Colombia, which are
the source of most of the cocaine that ends up on American streets,
and to end a decades-old guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia, a country of 37 million, has been in the grip of an
armed insurgency for 30 years. In many areas leftist guerrillas
have allied themselves with drug traffickers, who underwrite their
purchase of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, a former television anchor who understands the value
of dramatic images, ventured into the Colombian jungle last month
to meet with the leaders of the largest insurgent group. He has
promised to begin formal peace talks in the first three months of
his administration.
</P>
<P>
   James Dobbins, senior director for inter-American affairs at the
National Security Council, said Clinton had ``expressed admiration
for the courage Pastrana had shown in his election and in his steps
immediately after the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they believed that by
tackling the insurgency, Pastrana might be able to curb the
narcotics trade.
</P>
<P>
   During his Oval Office meeting, Dobbins said, Pastrana said the
two problems were inextricably linked, since the drug cultivation
and trafficking generally took place in the areas where the
insurgency was most active.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbins said Clinton had told Pastrana that ``the United States
wanted to support an integrated approach to the problems of drug
trafficking and bringing peace, ending Colombia's civil conflict.''
Pastrana, he said, already accepted an invitation to return to
Washington in the fall for a state visit.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Pastrana replaced his top military commanders after a
series of embarrassing defeats in clashes with the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration made Pastrana's job easier with its
decision earlier this year to lift economic sanctions that had been
imposed on Colombia for two years out of dissatisfaction with
Samper's drug policies. The lifting of the sanctions, Dobbins said,
offers ``both governments the opportunity for a new start.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana swept into office with the largest margin in his
country's history. A former senator and mayor of Bogota, the
Colombian capital, Pastrana will govern without a majority in
Congress.

   &UR; Frette to Wear &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Frette, the high-end Italian linen maker whose sheets
and pillowcases grace not only luxury homes but many of Europe's
top hotels, is introducing clothing. It's the reverse of the
increasingly common move of fashion designers into the home.
</P>
<P>
   Like almost every other global brand today, Frette sees an
opportunity to capitalize on its good name. ``The fact that women
have touched it, felt it, and the fact that you can take that same
feeling to clothing makes this a good opportunity,'' said Chris
Christiansen, the chief executive of Frette USA.
</P>
<P>
   The Frette Collection of lounge wear and sportswear will be
available in stores in spring 1999. The clothes, however, will not
necessarily be available in Frette's 43 stores worldwide, but the
apparel will be sold in department stores. ``To make the definitive
presentation, you really have to present all the different looks,''
Christiansen said. Many Frette stores, like the one in New York at
799 Madison Ave. (67th Street), are too small to do this.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, the company hired Brigitte Langevin, a former
fashion editor for French Glamour and more recently French Vogue,
as creative director. Ms. Langevin will oversee the creation of the
new collection.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Azria Backs Herve Leger &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fashion executives have bemoaned the dearth of
investors willing to back designers these days. The trend _
personified in Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH Moet
Hennessy-Louis Vuitton _ is to buy established designers' talent to
breathe life into an existing brand.
</P>
<P>
   It took as unlikely a person as Max Azria, the chairman of BCBG
Max Azria in Los Angeles, to buck that trend by announcing Thursday
his agreement to purchase a majority interest in the company of
Herve Leger, the French designer whose bandage dresses can turn
hip-flask dimensions into Coca-Cola bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Azria, considered no friend of designers because he has copied
ideas from European lines and dared to bring his reasonably priced
stylish clothing to the tents of Bryant Park, may have the last
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   He has worked hard in the last year to prove he has his own
inspirations by giving a preview of his collection in New York
before the European shows. He will stage a small presentation in
New York during the week of Sept. 14, when Calvin Klein, Donna
Karan and Helmut Lang are showing their spring 1999 lines. A
second, larger show will still be held during American show week,
scheduled for Oct. 30 to Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The sales of BCBG, a privately held company, have grown at an
astonishing rate, a projected $180 million by December, up from
$109 million in 1997, Azria said. Volume last year for Herve Leger
was close to $10 million, little of it in the United States, where
Azria plans to market the Leger collection most aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Crawford and Clarissa Bronfman, the wife of Edgar Bronfman
Jr., are among Leger's most prominent promoters. Bronfman is the
chief executive of the Seagram Company, which is selling Azria his
Leger stake.
</P>
<P>
   Leger's limited repertoire of bandage dresses has kept his
customer base narrow. Herve Leger boutiques and perhaps a secondary
collection will help expand sales, said Azria, who will own 95
percent of the company to Leger's 5 percent. This fall, Proctor &AMP;
Gamble is to market a Herve Leger fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way he looks at women,'' Azria said of Leger.
``It's very chic and elegant, yet sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   But sex was not on Azria's mind when he agreed to purchase the
company. Diversification was, he said. His business will now have
five divisions. In addition to Leger's and Azria's signature lines,
the others are Maxime, a line of traditional mid-price sportswear;
To the Max, a collection for juniors, and Parallel, contemporary
sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion designers and editors may have been perturbed about
Azria taking over the New York runways. Now, he will be on even
more sacred ground: the Paris catwalks.

OCEAN SPRAY SUES PEPSI OVER TROPICANA DISTRIBUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc., a cooperative of cranberry and
citrus growers, is seeking an injunction to block PepsiCo Inc. from
using its distribution channels to deliver Tropicana juices to
convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Pepsi announced plans to acquire Tropicana from
Seagram Co. Ltd. for $3.3 billion, but Ocean Spray claims such a
deal would violate a contract under which Pepsi distributes
single-serve Ocean Spray juices and juice drinks to retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Under a contract that expires at the end of the year 2000, Pepsi
agreed that Ocean Spray would be the only line of single-serve
juice drinks it would distribute, Ocean Spray claims.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray describes Tropicana as ``a primary competitor.''
Ocean Spray had sales of $1.44 billion last year; Tropicana had
sales of $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If Pepsi were also to distribute Tropicana single-serve juices
following an acquisition, that would violate Pepsi's contract with
Ocean Spray and cause Ocean Spray ``irreparable harm,'' argues a
suit filed in US District Court in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi disputed Ocean Spray's interpretation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along we're fully prepared to perform under our
distribution agreement so it's hard to understand the merits of a
lawsuit,'' said Pepsi spokesman Larry Jabbonsky.
</P>
<P>
   While the injunction that Ocean Spray seeks does not
specifically ask the court to block Pepsi's plan to buy Tropicana,
an injunction barring Pepsi from using its distribution network on
Tropicana's behalf would seem to undermine some of the business
rationale for the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Ocean Spray and Pepsi entered an alliance that gave
each company something it didn't have. Ocean Spray got access to
Pepsi's fleet of delivery trucks, and Pepsi was able to offer
retailers a single-serve juice line.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months ago, Pepsi said it wouldn't renew its agreement
with Ocean Spray, in part because it wanted to test-market a juice
line of its own.
</P>
<P>
   When that didn't work out, Pepsi said in March it would continue
to distribute Ocean Spray juices until the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement has been important to Ocean Spray. At a time when
the Lakevill, Mass. cooperative's annual sales have been roughly
flat, its $225 million single-serve category has been one of Ocean
Spray's fastest growing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Pepsi announced plans to acquire Tropicana, a deal
that could give Pepsi the juice line it has wanted so long.
</P>
<P>
   One of the synergies from such a deal could be exploiting
Pepsi's distribution system on Tropicana's behalf, said Tony Vento,
an analyst with Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
   How the lawsuit between Ocean Spray and Pepsi is resolved may
depend on the precise wording of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Ocean Spray protect itself'' adequately against the
contingency of Pepsi acquiring an Ocean Spray rival? asked Robert
Berry, a professor at Boston College Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Pepsi renewed its agreement with Ocean Spray only a
few months ago, one might assume that Pepsi's lawyers believe that
the Tropicana acquisition does not violate the distribution
agreement between Pepsi and Ocean Spray, Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Pepsi shares fell 1 11/16 to
close at 35 13/16 .

   &UR; Sacred Music Festivals &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I find out about two musical events next year _ the
Fez Festival of World Sacred Music in Morocco and the Sacred Voices
festival in London. _ Adolph Paul, Milwaukee
</P>
<P>
   A. The program for the fifth annual World Sacred Music Festival,
planned for May 29 to June 5, has not been set, but it will
presumably be similar in scope. The best source for information is
probably the official travel coordinator for the festival in the
United States, Sarah Tours, 1803 Belleview Boulevard, Alexandria,
Va. 22307; (800) 267-0036, fax (703) 765-7809; its site on the
Internet is www.morocco-fezfestival.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah has put together a festival tour leaving New York on May
27 and returning June 8. Besides attendance at festival events, the
tour includes visits to the Medina of Fez and Marrakesh, and
excursions to the hot springs of Moulay Yacob, the Sidi Ahmed al
Barnoussi shrine and to the Roman ruins at Volubilis. Prices, with
choices of three-, four- or five-star hotels, are $4,285 to $5,355
a person, double occupancy, including business-class air fare from
New York. Extensions to the Sahara or Spain are available.
</P>
<P>
   The 16th annual Music Village festival, scheduled for June 23 to
July 11, will have as its theme Sacred Voices, according to Carolyn
Axtell, administrative coordinator of Cultural Cooperation, the
group planning it. The full schedule is not yet ready, though some
events will be free, including open-air concerts in parks on
weekends, Ms. Axtell said. There will also be weekday concerts and
workshops.
</P>
<P>
   The festival expects to feature singers from around the world,
presenting music as diverse as that of Southern Baptists, Brazilian
Candomble believers, Tibetan Buddhists and Lebanese Maronites.
</P>
<P>
   For information, contact Cultural Cooperation, Toynbee Studios,
28 Commercial Street, London E1 6LS; (44-171) 247-8808, fax

   &UR; A South Pacific Tour &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I plan to visit Australia and New Zealand for
three weeks. What are your suggestions to see and how to get
around? _ Bernard P. Gropp, Summit, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. Since Australia is about the size of the United States minus
Alaska, and New Zealand is bigger than all but a few states, there
are myriad choices. But Renata Gombac of the Australia Tourist
Commission and Clyde H. Farnsworth, a former Times correspondent
living in Australia, agreed on several must-sees. These include
Sydney, with its famed opera house and Harbour Bridge, the Great
Barrier Reef and rain forest in the northeast, and Ayers Rock, one
of the most sacred sites for Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
   They also differed somewhat. Ms. Gombac suggested an itinerary
would take you to New Zealand for a week and two weeks in
Australia, starting in Melbourne. From there, you would fly to the
Red Centre region for a taste of the Outback and a visit to Ayers
Rock. Then, it would be on to North Queensland for several days
around Palm Cove to visit the rain forest, the Undara Lava Tubes
and the reef. Finally, you would head for Sydney and its outlying
areas, like the Hunter Valley wine region or the Blue Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Such a tour would start at $3,875 a person in low season (April
to August) and about $500 more peak. It is available from Swain
Australia Tours, (800) 227-9246.
</P>
<P>
   Other places Farnsworth suggests are Alice Springs in the Red
Centre desert; Tasmania and its former penal colony at Port Arthur;
Adelaide, noted for its literary and music festivals, and rugged
Kangaroo Island, ``a microcosm of what Australia must have been
before the Europeans came.'' And he expresses a special fondness
for Perth and Fremantle, on the west coast.
</P>
<P>
   Train travel in Australia is quite good, but for long distances
you might want to get a Qantas Airways Boomerang Pass _ a minimum
of two vouchers for travel within or between three national zones
and New Zealand _ $175 within a zone, $220 between zones. The
airline says it saves money on flights of more than an hour, and
offers flexibility. The pass must be bought before getting to
Australia. Call (800) 227-4500 for details.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing New Zealand's North Island, Anna Sinnott, East Coast
manager of the New Zealand Tourism Board, suggested visiting
Auckland's wharf area, seeing the Maritime Museum and Kelly
Tarlton's Undersea World, and taking a Pride of Auckland cruise,
then going to Rotorua, the home of the Maori people, to see the
thermal springs and the Agridome, with its sheep shows.
</P>
<P>
   On the Alpine-like South Island, she recommended touring
Queenstown, taking a jet boat river ride, and visiting the
Fiordland, including an excursion to Milford Sound.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, contact the Australian Tourist Commission,
(805) 775-2000, fax (805) 775-4448, or at www.aussie.net.au/, and
the New Zealand Tourism Board, (800) 388-5494, fax (212) 832-7602,
or www.nztb.govt.nz/.

<P>
   &UR; Side Trip to Majorca &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be going to Barcelona on business and I would like to
take a short trip afterward to Majorca. Can I arrange to get on a
small group tour? _ Linda E. Goodman, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Groups usually go to Majorca as part of broader tours,
according to Jordi Castello of the New York office of El Corte
Ingles Travel, a large Spanish agency. He does not know of a tour
specifically from Barcelona to Majorca.

FORD TO LOWER PRICES FOR 1999 CARS AND TRUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Ford Motor Co. announced on Monday that the average
price of its 1999 model cars and trucks would decrease three-tenths
of 1 percent, or about $61, from comparably equipped 1998 models.
Ford made significant decreases in the prices of its highest-volume
cars, the Ford Taurus and the Mercury Sable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, for the first time in over 30 years, we were able
to hold the line on prices,'' Lloyd Hansen, controller for Ford's
marketing and sales operations, said in an interview. ``This year
is the first time in over 30 years we've actually reduced prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 model year, which starts on Oct. 1, will mark the
second consecutive year that all major automakers hold the line on
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen outright deflation in car prices over the last two
years,'' said William P. Wilson, vice president and economist for
Comerica Bank, Detroit. The bank's tracking of new-vehicle
transaction prices, the price for which vehicles actually sell,
show an eight-tenths of 1 percent drop this May compared with May
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said worldwide excess capacity in auto production had
created an extremely competitive environment in North America that
prevented automakers from increasing prices.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler Corp. announced in July that its overall prices
remained essentially unchanged from 1998 prices, up 0.1 percent, or
about $35 a vehicle, due largely to regulatory emission costs.
Chrysler's 1998 prices remained virtually the same as those in
1997. Price increases in 1995 and 1996 were under 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. said its prices, only a few of which have
been announced, would be relatively flat. In June, the GM Saturn
division said its 1999 prices would include a price reduction on
its coupe. Saturn, which does not offer incentives and prohibits
price haggling in the showroom, reduced prices and added equipment
to some models last year as well.
</P>
<P>
   GM does not plan to announce an overall percentage of price
change, but will announce prices on individual 1999 models as they
are introduced.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, GM's 1999 models will not arrive in
dealerships for a couple months because of a 54-day strike by the
United Automobile Workers union at two parts plants that shut down
almost all of GM's North American assembly plants. Most plants are
back in full operation and will produce 1998 models through
September to use up the inventory of parts designed for those
vehicles before changing over to 1999 models.
</P>
<P>
   Import manufacturers typically announce prices in late summer or
early fall.
</P>
<P>
   At Ford, prices of cars dropped an average of 1.7 percent; truck
prices fell 0.5 percent. Prices of Ford-model cars and trucks
dipped 0.2 percent; prices of Lincoln-Mercury vehicles, which are
mostly cars, fell 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the Ford Taurus LX dropped $1,000, to $17,995,
including destination fees. A typically equipped SE sedan will have
a base price of $18,995, down $1,080, and the SE station wagon
drops $1,840, to $19,995. Prices of the Taurus cousin, the Mercury
Sable, also dropped $1,000 to $1,800.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to put a price on the car that is a recognized
value,'' said Hansen, the Ford official. ``We're hopeful over time
we will not have to resort to incentives.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford is hoping the lower prices will stimulate sales, as it did
last year. For example, Ford lowered the prices for the Mustang,
the two-door Explorer and the Escort ZX2 for the 1998 model year,
resulting in double-digit sales increases.
</P>
<P>
   Prices were decreased for the small Ranger pickup, and sales
doubled. For 1999, the Ranger will be offered with a flexible fuel
engine _ one that burns ethanol and gasoline _ for no extra charge;
flexible fuel engines typically cost more than gasoline-only
engines.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also claims to be the first auto manufacturer to eliminate
the added charge for emissions equipment required in California,
New York and Massachusetts. Ford previously charged $170.
</P>
<P>
   On other cars, particularly the Escort and the Contour, Ford
added equipment for the same 1998 price. Hansen said that beyond
competitive pressures, Ford's pricing strategy has been to not
increase prices. This year's lower prices have been made possible
by reducing costs. Ford reported a total of $4.3 billion in cost
reductions in 1997 and through the first half of 1998.

MUSEUMS VIE TO WIN PIECE OF ROTHSCHILD COLLECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Pa., Mass., N.Y.) (js) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All her life, Judith Rothschild was a journeyman
artist. She studied art and worked steadily from the time she
graduated from Wellesley College in 1943, exhibiting mainly in
small, respectable galleries and always trying new ways to paint.
But she never achieved much fame or following, and when she died in
1993 she was largely unknown to the public and to many in the art
world.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has landed her first-ever retrospective; 31 works fill
three galleries in the 20th-century wing of the Metropolitan Museum
of Art. At the opening reception on May 18, at least half a dozen
prominent museum directors turned up. And to draw attention to the
show, the Met sprang for splashy ads in The New York Times, The New
Yorker, The New York Observer and other publications in greater
numbers than it usually does for a show of this size.
</P>
<P>
   But Judith Rothschild has not suddenly taken the art world by
storm. Many curators, artists and other experts suspect that that
was never the museum's point. Rather, they contend, over the
museum's denials, that the Met had ulterior motives in scheduling
the show, that it is less interested in her art than in the works
by 20th-century masters that she left behind.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Rothschild died, she put her own artworks into the
Judith Rothschild Foundation, along with a passel of paintings that
she inherited from her parents. Among them were three works by
Picasso, 10 by Mondrian, five by Matisse, nine by Gris, four by
Leger and two by Brancusi, all of which the foundation is
eventually expected to sell or give away. To no one's surprise,
museums are vying for them.
</P>
<P>
   Using the standard gesture of an institution hoping for a gift,
the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the Philadelphia Museum
of Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art have already
exhibited the Rothschild Family Collection of European paintings.
The National Gallery later received a Picabia painting, a partial
gift from Ms. Rothschild's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Met, which was not offered that show and did not ask for
it, simply trying a twist on an old tactic?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised that the Met was doing a Rothschild
retrospective,'' said Marla Prather, curator of 20th-century art at
the National Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``But everyone is hoping that something from the Rothschild
collection will come their way. Rather than be one of the museums
displaying the collection, the Met is doing a monographic show'' of
Ms. Rothschild's work, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Others were more direct, though they declined to speak for
attribution for fear of alienating the Met. ``There's no possible
explanation for the show except that they are waiting for the
Rothschild collection,'' said one respected painter who insisted on
anonymity. ``I've never seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Chuck Close, the portraitist, said, ``The exhibition is a
surprise to everyone I know, and people are free to figure out why
it's there.'' (Not long ago Close derailed an exhibition of his
work at the Met because it was not slated for the museum's most
prestigious galleries. Instead, he had a retrospective this year at
the Museum of Modern Art.)
</P>
<P>
   Harold Holzer, the Met's spokesman, denied any suggestion that
the museum had an eye on the foundation's blue-chip holdings when
it planned the Rothschild retrospective. ``The Met's exhibition
schedule is independent of its acquisition aspirations,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   William Lieberman, the Met's 20th-century-art curator and the
organizer of the Rothschild exhibition, also rejected the
speculation about his rationale for the show, calling it ``unguided
itchiness,'' among other things less suitable for print.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there a connection in the eyes of Harvey Shipley Miller,
who as sole trustee of the Rothschild Foundation has complete
discretion to sell or donate its paintings. ``The European painting
collection has nothing to do with this show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no denying that these are very competitive times
for museums. Major works of art cost $10 million and more, and the
supply of museum-quality works that remains in private hands,
potentially available for acquisition, is shrinking. Museum
directors and curators spend an increasing amount of time on what
they euphemistically call ``patron development,'' what in reality
is a fierce contest to woo donations from the rich or their
estates.
</P>
<P>
   Auction houses and art dealers are stepping up their courting of
collectors, too. In February, for example, Christie's copied the
standard museum modus operandi when it exhibited and published a
fancy $45 catalog of the Herbig collection of contemporary art
without a promise from the owner that it could sell the artworks.
The strategy worked, and when Christie's put the collection on the
block in June it fetched $11.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many museums are expanding, creating even more
demand for great works of art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museums need collectors more than ever now because of the
impossibility of buying really good things,'' said George Abrams, a
Boston lawyer, collector of Old Master drawings and trustee of the
Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. ``There's no way a museum can spend
$10 million to $15 million on a painting, and that's what it takes
to buy a Matisse, say.''
</P>
<P>
   At most museums, donations now make up well over half of
acquisitions, and at the Met the figure is over 90 percent, Holzer
said. Lieberman has been widely quoted as saying, ``I don't collect
paintings, I collect collectors,'' a statement he denies. But he
says that Alfred Barr, the founding director of the Museum of
Modern Art, his former employer, called him ``the curator of the
collectors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rothschild Family Collection was amassed by Herbert
Rothschild, a furniture manufacturer and dealer, not part of the
Rothschild banking family, and his wife, Nanette, with the guidance
of their daughter Judith. When they died in the 1970s, they split
their estate among their three children in a way that left most of
the art to Judith.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say the collection is uneven, and no one would rank
it with the best collections that the Met has captured over the
years, like those of the Havemeyer family, Robert Lehman, Walter
Annenberg or, most recently, Jacques and Natasha Gelman. All were
chockablock with classic works by master artists.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rothschild Family Collection does have enough gems to
whet museums' appetites. Among the museum directors, besides
Philippe de Montebello of the Met, looking at the art, sipping
Champagne, nibbling smoked salmon and generally currying favor with
Miller on May 18 were Earl Powell 3rd of the National Gallery of
Art, Glenn Lowry of the Museum of Modern Art, Anne d'Harnoncourt of
the Philadelphia Museum of Art, David Ross of the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art and J. Carter Brown, director emeritus of the
National Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   If it is the strategic move that people say it is, the
Rothschild exhibit may be unique; no expert called on could think
of an exact parallel. But female artists married to male artists of
greater stature have certainly endured something similar. Some
galleries, for example, exhibited the paintings of Lee Krasner,
Jackson Pollock's widow, partly in hopes of getting their hands on
something by him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that when it came to galleries, there was
a quid pro quo going on, and my guess is that it happened at
museums, too,'' said Andrea Gabor, the author of ``Einstein's Wife:
Work and Marriage in the Lives of Five Great 20th-Century Women''
(Viking/Penguin, 1995), which includes a section on Krasner.
</P>
<P>
   Holzer said there was no quid pro quo with the Rothschild
Foundation. The Met paid for the exhibition, the reception and the
advertising from its own budget, he said, but declined to say how
much it all cost.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rothschild started with pure abstractions, went through a
phase of landscape and figurative work, moved into brightly colored
abstract landscapes and finally settled on bold abstract relief
paintings. But as Grace Glueck, a critic for The New York Times,
wrote in her review of the show, she ``never really found herself
as a painter.'' No other publication has reviewed the exhibition,
which was subtitled ``An Artist's Search,'' Holzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Eyebrows were raised about her show because it is at the Met,
which has often been criticized for ignoring the work of so many
well-known contemporary artists. For artists of this century,
having a solo show there puts Rothschild in the company of Willem
de Kooning, Georgia O'Keeffe, Rene Magritte, Lucian Freud and David
Hockney, plus a few lesser lights like Sidney Nolan, an Australian
artist who died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hers is a career worth looking at,'' Ms. Prather of the
National Gallery said, ``but one could argue if she deserves a show
at the Met. She is not Matisse, she is not Mondrian, but in the
'90s she hit her stride in those relief paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   As curators and museum directors well know, wooing does work,
when it is well done. Earlier this year the Rothschild Foundation
gave the National Gallery and the Philadelphia museum their choice
of paintings by Rothschild. And both museums admit they also hunger
for something from the Rothschild Family Collection. ``We hope for
a gift, absolutely,'' said Ann Temkin, the curator of 20th-century
art at the Philadelphia museum.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Prather said, ``With our Rothschild show, we can say that
there was not a one-to-one guarantee, but we did hope to gain
something from the collection. But we had no qualms about showing
that first-rate collection.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia museum is still empty-handed, but after the
show the National Gallery did receive its Picabia.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Met, last year the Rothschild Foundation donated two
Judith Rothschild paintings, ``Grey Tangent'' from 1947 and ``Death
of Patroklos'' from 1987, and last winter the foundation
contributed money to help sponsor an exhibition of the painter
Richard Pousette-Dart. So far, however, the museum has nothing from
the Rothschild Family Collection. And the Judith Rothschild show
remains on view until Sept. 6.

PHILOSOPHERS READY TO DEAL WITH REAL-WORLD ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The last few decades have been lonely years for
philosophers, a time when the world sometimes teetered on the brink
of nuclear war and they seemed preoccupied with linguistic
hair-splitting. Philosophers nearly became the intellectual
equivalent of one hand clapping: nobody heard them.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, at the world's largest-ever gathering of
philosophers, philosophers declared themselves back in the hunt for
truth and goodness, and eager to help a fast-changing technological
society solve problems from teaching values to children to coping
with religious extremists.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 3,000 philosophers at the opening of the week-long
World Congress of Philosophy heard the call to service, but also
got a harsh critique from their host, Boston University Chancellor
John Silber, who said they have themselves to blame for their
isolation. Silber charged that feminists, Marxists and others had
turned philosophy into ``an assault on reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Friedrich Nietzsche declared that God is dead, Silber
argued, philosophers have been moving away from the idea that
universal truth exists, turning people's most closely held beliefs
into mere opinions. This slippery slope, in turn, leads to each
interest group claiming that no one outside the group can
understand their experience, Silber said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These positions, to paraphrase a remark attributed to Orwell,
are nonsense so bad that only an intellectual could believe them,''
said Silber.
</P>
<P>
   Silber's main target, feminists, replied that Silber had
caricatured their efforts to combat sexism, which they called a
common tactic to put women down. ``This is the kind of thing you
might expect at a political rally,'' said Phyllis Rooney of Oakland
University.
</P>
<P>
   The World Congress, the first in four years and the last of this
century, in some ways defied stereotypes of philosophers. Yes,
there were lots of wise, gray-bearded men, including a couple of
dead ringers for Karl Marx, but there were also Indian women in
saris, African women with corn-rowed hair and middle-aged people
wearing fanny packs on their waists.
</P>
<P>
   The vast gathering, which took six universities as well as the
United Nations more than two years to pull together, looked like a
bonanza to Julian Baggini, fresh in from London with copies of his
publication, The Philosophers' Magazine. ``This is our big chance
to break into the US market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as Sherry Wieder, saw the conference as a chance to
even scores. Standing in front of a poster of a mustachioed
turn-of-the-century psychiatrist named Emil Kraepelin, Wieder
explained how Sigmund Freud unjustly overshadowed Kraepelin, who
first diagnosed schizophrenia and manic depression.
</P>
<P>
   Wieder said the International Kraepelin Society planned to build
a Hall of Fame of Psychology and Philosophy near Poughkeepsie,
N.Y., where, among other things, Kraepelin's true legacy could be
explored.
</P>
<P>
   But the core business of the conference revolved around this
year's theme, ``Philosophy Educating Humanity,'' meant to symbolize
the return of many philosophers to engagement with the pressing
issues of the late 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are truth, goodness and beauty? How should people live
with wealth and poverty? War and peace?'' asked Robert Neville,
dean of Boston University's School of Theology. ``Only philosophy,
I say, can raise our children to address these crises of wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Olson of Boston University, director of the conference
organizing committee, said from World War II until recently,
philosophy was dominated by dry analytical works that ``just deal
with clarity of propositions ... and are not really concerned with
anything outside itself.'' As a result, the Cold War came and went,
and philosophers were on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Olson, ``analytical philosophy has found its soul,''
and an increasing number of philosophers are rejecting major
philosophical themes such as relativism, where there is no such
thing as absolute truth.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers underscored the theme of greater relevance with
marquee speakers such as Alasdair MacIntyre of Duke University, a
scholar of Marx who came to believe God exists, and Brown
University's Martha Nussbaum, an influential thinker on the need
for a classical liberal education. Organizers also emphasized
engagement with their suggestion that American high schools offer
more philosophy courses.
</P>
<P>
   Yersu Kim of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization told the group that the conference itself was
a step toward more relevance. The meeting ``signals the return of a
significant segment of the world philosophical community ... to the
classical mission of philosophy ... enlightenment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the quiet, library-like exhibition hall of the
conference, one observer cautioned against expecting too much.
Surrounded by the works of Ayn Rand, Jean Paul Sartre and other
luminaries in his Scholar's Choice book nook, Loren Dykstra said
philosophers have a hard time agreeing on things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd almost like to think that they ought to have solved half
the world's problems, but that's not likely,'' said salesman
Dykstra. ``Philosophers know how to ask questions better than they
know how to give answers.''

launched the first rocket from the ocean later this year.
Washington Post first reported the suspension came because
sensitive technology was exchanged with the Russians. State
department official said the project can continue once Boeing
provides a new security framework, but this means no launch until
next year. A congressional source, who talked with state and
Boeing, says the case is very similar to that of Loral, which is
under investigation by Congress. In both cases, company executives
blew whistle on themselves. But in the Boeing case, apparently no
classified information was exchanged. Just technical.

   Long before other girls her age were torturing their tresses
with hot combs and chemical straighteners, Terri Gardner and her
dog, a mutt named Cinnamon, became testers for the shampoos and
pomades her father mixed in the basement of their brick bungalow on
Chicago's South Side.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Edward Gardner would slather Cinnamon with creams he
concocted to condition coarse, curly hair. The next, he would coat
his 8-year-old daughter's dark-brown locks with a thick glaze he
envisioned other black women and girls using to style their bobs
and finger waves.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, the experiments would go horribly wrong, including
one that left the girl's hair and hands tinted mauve for weeks. In
time, though, Gardner perfected his techniques, and the business he
created with his wife, Bettiann, grew into Soft Sheen Products
Inc., one of the largest ethnic hair-products companies in the
United States with sales last year of $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, though, Ms. Gardner, 42, who is now Soft Sheen's
president and chief executive, and the rest of the Gardner family
took a hard look at market trends and decided to sell their company
to L'Oreal SA of France, the world's largest cosmetics company.
</P>
<P>
   The Gardners figured that with corporate giants chasing the
increasingly lucrative African-American market, their growth
prospects were dim without access to more capital.
</P>
<P>
   L'Oreal, for its part, saw Soft Sheen as a gateway to consumers
whose needs and neighborhoods it had overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the same calculations that lay behind the
L'Oreal acquisition are powering lots of other deals around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Black-owned companies in fields such as beauty products, funeral
services and insurance, which first thrived in a segregationist
era, are deciding that it makes more sense to join big corporations
than to fight them.
</P>
<P>
   And though blacks are steadily creating businesses in a wider
range of fields than ever before, some see the recent acquisitions
as an unfortunate end of control by the pioneers of black
entrepreneurship in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, corporations buying the companies are doing so
because they are waking up to an explosion of black economic
strength. A study released last month by the University of
Georgia's Selig Center for Economic Growth calculated that black
purchasing power would reach $533 billion in 1999, up 73 percent
from $308 billion in 1990, compared with a 57 percent increase
projected for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Such income growth ``should create tremendous opportunities for
businesses that pay attention to the needs and preferences of
African-American consumers,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Humphreys, a
University of Georgia economist.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, companies born in storefronts and basements in the
1950s and '60s that grew into thriving enterprises in the '70s and
'80s have become guests at corporate America's latest merger party.
It is a little-noticed trend that stands in contrast to the
deal-making boom of a decade ago, when black-owned companies stayed
largely on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there have been high-profile sales of black-owned
companies in the past, like the acquisition of Motown Records by a
consortium headed by MCA Records in 1988. But though no one has
exact figures, marketing specialists say the pace has picked up in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest transactions was IVX Bioscience Inc.'s
purchase of Johnson Products Co., which makes ethnic cosmetics and
hair-care products, in 1993 for $67 million in stock. (IVX sold the
unit last month to Carson Inc. for $85 million.)
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1993, Shorebank Corp. of Chicago bought Indecorp Inc.,
the second-largest black-owned banking firm in that city.
</P>
<P>
   The following are among the deals concluded since then:
</P>
<P>
   _ the acquisition in 1996 of U S Radio, then the largest
black-owned radio group in the country with 25 stations, by Clear
Channel Communications
</P>
<P>
   _ the purchase by Stewart Enterprises, a multinational
conglomerate of more than 500 funeral homes and 135 cemeteries, of
the Hillcrest funeral parlor in Albuquerque, N.M., in 1996 from its
black and Hispanic owners for $1 million
</P>
<P>
   _ the 1997 merger of Garrett &AMP; Davenport in Raleigh, N.C., the
state's oldest minority-owned certified public-accounting firm,
with Cherry Bekaert &AMP; Holland of Richmond, Va., the largest
accounting firm in the Southeast
</P>
<P>
   _ the sale last March by Universal Life Insurance Co., a
venerable firm started 75 years ago, of the bulk of its business to
American Capital Life Insurance Co. for $13 million
</P>
<P>
   _ the acquisition in May of McNeely &AMP; Associates in Milwaukee,
one of Wisconsin's largest African-American law firms, by the
Milwaukee firm of Domnitz Mawicke Goisman &AMP; Rosenberg
</P>
<P>
   _ L'Oreal's agreement last month to buy Soft Sheen for an
undisclosed price that one analyst estimated at well above $160
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are starting to see a lot of larger black-owned companies
becoming attractive targets for other large companies that want to
reach in and expand their market,'' said Alfred Edmond Jr.,
executive editor of Black Enterprise magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Though the owners of the acquired companies can expect a
handsome payoff, not everyone views the changing of the guard as
cause for celebration. ``It is the alligator eating up the
goldfish,'' said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, whose Rainbow/Push
coalition has been calling for more career opportunities and access
to investment capital for members of minorities so they can more
often be the acquirer in these deals.
</P>
<P>
   Some large corporations, of course, have long been developing
products and services aimed at black consumers. But now more
corporations are looking for a quicker route to African-Americans'
pocketbooks by snapping up businesses whose legacies and brands,
like Ebony magazine and Soft Sheen's Optimum hair relaxer, are as
well known in ethnic households as Tide and Colgate are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about the numbers,'' said Lafayette Jones, chief
executive of Segmented Marketing Services Inc. in Winston-Salem,
N.C., an ethnic-marketing consultant. ``The American population is
increasingly becoming ethnic, and by ethnic I mean
African-American, Latino and Asian. We are talking about $750
billion in collective spending power.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just Americans that big multinationals are aiming
at. Many believe that brands that have become cultural icons
representing ethnic Americana hold huge appeal in Africa and other
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   L'Oreal, for example, is adding to its arsenal such popular
products as Soft Sheen Hair and Scalp conditioner, which softened
Afros in the 1960s, and Care Free Curl activator, which was used to
create the trendy mop of glossy ringlets in the 1980s known as
``the curl.''
</P>
<P>
   Soft Sheen products are key to the company's strategy to expand
into countries with a need for ethnic hair and cosmetics products.
``Africa is the new major area of development for us,'' said Guy
Peyrelongue, president and chief executive officer of L'Oreal's
U.S. subsidiary, Cosmair Inc.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetics giant's international ambitions helped persuade
the Gardners to let go of their company. ``We knew we had to
compete with bigger players with deeper pockets,'' said Ms.
Gardner, who will continue to run Soft Sheen for L'Oreal and will
join the board of Cosmair.
</P>
<P>
   As for Edward Gardner, he was once so singularly focused on the
business brewing in his basement that his two sons and two
daughters often waited for dinner until Ms. Gardner retrieved her
pots and pans and washed off the chemicals. Now, at 73, he takes a
remarkably unsentimental view of relinquishing his venture.
``Selling the company to me is just a phase, just like starting the
company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Jackson's lament that old-time black companies are being
picked off by corporate America, there is plenty of evidence that
black entrepreneurs have broken into industries that were largely
closed to them in the days when Jackson was marching alongside Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks are pursuing their entrepreneurial ambitions in
industries ranging from computer software to musical production to
cable-television programming.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some black business pioneers are resisting pressures
to sell. One is John H. Johnson, founder and chairman of Johnson
Publishing Co., which puts out Ebony and Jet magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big companies have been asleep and are awake now and
realize there are great opportunities out there,'' said Johnson,
who founded Johnson Publishing in 1942 when he was 24 and who added
a cosmetics business to his empire in 1973 to cater to women with
skin tones that range from dark to coffee with cream. ``They are
making offers that are hard to refuse,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that he saw nothing wrong with others selling their
businesses but that he did not expect his family name to be peeled
off the office door.
</P>
<P>
   He said he routinely receives calls from investment bankers
whose clients want to buy his business _ and has instructed his
secretary not to put them through. ``I have a granddaughter who is
9 years old, and she is already saying she is going to take over,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Shaw Jr., the great-grandson of the founder of Universal
Life Insurance, grew up with similar aspirations but is now reeling
from poor succession planning and a failure to keep pace with
changes in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, 35, who heads the company's underwriting division, said
the financial outlook had become so bleak that in March the company
was forced to sell $53 million in life-insurance-premium
obligations to American Capital Life for $13 million. The company
now believes the best option might be to unload the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge for me personally and professionally to have
to try to make something happen out of this,'' Shaw said, his voice
trailing off. ``But it will come down to prudent and real business
decisions, not emotion,'' he added more forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   Like Universal Life, Hillcrest, the funeral home in Albuquerque,
faced the same fate when much bigger corporate rivals intruded on
its turf. At first, the owners pinned their hopes on the loyalty of
the black and Hispanic communities that they served. But those
hopes faded fast after the big rivals began hiring black employees
and slashing prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would open a cut-rate facility and sell services for
$2,000 complete, and at the other end of town sell them for $6,000
_ and the same company owned both places,'' said Eddie White, a
Hillcrest partner. When Hillcrest fell behind on its taxes, he
said, he and his partner sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Enterprises, Hillcrest's current owner, says it does not
try to drive local operators out of business when it enters a
market.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jackson acknowledges that market forces are altering the
complexion of black business, he worries that something precious
will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we'll have less pride, we'll have less control,''
Jackson said, ``and a level of infrastructure that took years to
build will go in a minute or two.''

THE INDIE SCENE REVS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Photo has been sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 (JT)  
 By AMY M. SPINDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It wasn't just your imagination. Finally, there's
proof that department stores and mass-marketed designers have
reached an intolerable level of banality: fashion's indie movement
has begun.
</P>
<P>
   When the music industry gets bogged down in overproduced, bland
fluff, a more complex style like rap or punk explodes from
independent record labels. When the film industry is overrun by
soulless offerings, there's hunger for sophisticated independent
movies. And now, as department stores are increasingly vapid, and
as designer offerings increasingly court the masses, fashion has
sparked its own independent movement with the indie boutique.
</P>
<P>
   It began more than a year ago in densely packed shopping areas
of Tokyo, like Shibuya and Harajuku, where streets are lined with
what the Japanese call indies _ art, music or design stores that
are less about merchandise than membership in a subculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're tiny shops with their own specific mood,'' said Nina
Garduno, a vice president of Ron Herman/Fred Segal Melrose, who
buys items from the stores. ``Everything has become so mainstream,
produced for the mass market, that if you're creative, you have to
fund yourself and make your own environment so you can show the
world exactly what kind of art you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   On New York streets like Stanton, East Ninth, Orchard and
Elizabeth, an American indie scene is taking over, with
designer-curators, many of them familiar with the trend in Tokyo,
creating stores where fashion, furniture, music, art, architecture
and hip nostalgia come together. With the same spirit, and with
creative characters like those who populate the independent film
and music movements, indie boutiques are a rebellious response to a
homogenized market.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw in Japan last year that the Japanese independent
designer was really having a resurgence,'' said Savania
Davies-Keiller, who just opened the best new indie boutique, DDC
Lab, on Orchard Street. ``If you walk around the hot spots of
Japan, they're all independent designers saying, `Sit in the back
and I'll make this up for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The very ubiquity and marketing efficiency of big-name designers
and store chains are shaping up to be the establishment's undoing,
say the indie boutique owners, whose criticisms sound a lot like
those leveled this summer at ``Godzilla'' and ``Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who travel a lot become so saturated by seeing the same
things in every country _ Tommy Hilfiger, the Gap and J. Crew all
over the place,'' said Maria Cornejo, who was a design partner with
John Richmond when they had 20 stores in Tokyo called 3D Richmond
Cornejo. Today, she has one store _ Zero, on Mott Street, which
opened a month ago. ``You can't compete with these big companies,
because they'll rip you off if you do anything anyway,'' she said.
``The only way someone like me can compete is doing something
original and having it in one place.''
</P>
<P>
   For nomadic fashion insiders, the philosophical prototype of the
indie store is the ground floor of Colette, in Paris, where items
like Nike tennis shoes _ high-tech versions that stylists favor _
are shown on pedestals or under glass. Colette is a gallery of
ephemeral design obsessions, the one right vase of the moment, the
one preferred bicycle, the one makeup brush. There's no point in
saying what is ``the one.'' By the time you read about it, it will
have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike big stores and chain designer shops, the indie boutiques
are built for speed. The design studio is often in the back room.
And merchandise is displayed only as long as it earns the passion
and commands the attention of the designer-owners.
</P>
<P>
   Stores like Colette, DDC Lab, Zero, Language on Mulberry Street
and Bond 07 on Bond Street are shortcuts for the shopper into the
jet-set fashion world's design fixations, like DDC Lab's John
Smedley T-shirts from London or Mikki Millay's hand-knit kangaroo
pouches from Japan, which complement Ms. Davies-Keiller's
innovative clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Boutiques like Phare and Seize sur Vingt, both on Elizabeth
Street, and Meghan Kinney on East Ninth Street offer what James
Jurney, an owner of Seize sur Vingt, calls ``the luxury of the
cognescenti.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The appeal of this neighborhood is they come down
here and they're part of the process, the artisanship of the
clothes being made. It's a luxury you don't get in strip malls in
middle America.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cornejo, of Zero, said, ``Clothes are incidental.'' Her
husband, Mark Borthwick, is a photographer for The Face, ID and
Italian Vogue, and he is putting together photography exhibitions
for the store, which also sells Fernlund Logan ebonized-wood and
stainless steel furniture, and Bless handbags that turn into
garments. And, of course, conceptual clothes by Ms. Cornejo, like a
tube-and-circle dress.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion establishment trots out its new passions every
season, when a new collection is introduced on the runway; indie
boutiques can give vent to them every day. In fact, there was a
time when the ultimate expression of fashion independence was
staging a runway show. But runway schedules have expanded, making
it increasingly difficult for small designers to be noticed. For
the same cost as one runway presentation on the regular schedule,
an indie designer can run a boutique all year long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm spending $2,000 a month for two floors,'' said Tony
Melillo, whose Nova boutique will open soon on Stanton Street.
``And I get to create my own New York image out of that. Indie
stores in general give you the ability to create this great space
and great image for not a lot of money. On every street in Japan
there are 10 in a row, their own image, their own look and their
own clientele.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   This generation is subverting the model for success in fashion
so completely that most don't even care about selling wholesale.
``The problem working with big stores is they sanitize every
collection, so every collection looks the same in every store no
matter what floor you're on or price point you buy,'' Ms. Cornejo
said. ``Any independence you have is taken away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   As with the independent music and film scenes, credibility
(which translates into not being blatantly commercial) is a
defining element of the indie boutique. So is the original content,
which is supposed to draw the customers in and keep them
interested. ``They stay like it's a salon,'' said Selima Salaun,
whose Bond 07 is a showcase for the cool eyeglasses she designs, as
well as antique furniture, lingerie by Ellen Berkenblit, hats by
Eugenia Kim and handbags by Amy Chan. ``Our customers don't buy,
pay and run out like the Gap and those boutiques you see more and
more in New York, the cold efficient boutiques.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s and early '70s, one-of-a-kind stores like Biba
in London led visionaries like Norma Kamali and Betsey Johnson to
conceive the boutique as a New York scene, a club with clothes. The
concept was so successful that department stores like
Bloomingdale's borrowed it to make shopping a splashy 1980s-worthy
event, alongside European designer boutiques, which became the new
destination stores. But big-name designer boutiques looked like
what they were: monuments to monumental egos. The merchandise mix
was gone; in its place were hundreds of products with one designer
name. So your life could be stamped from your shower in the morning
to your lingerie at night, cradle to grave, with someone else's
name. It was the end of the store as a creative collective.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. ``This is the first time since the late '60s that
it's actually happening again,'' Ms. Kamali said. ``I feel the
exhilaration I had in the beginning.''

   LA-COPDEAD (Los Angeles) _ Los Angeles police wore black bands
across their badges today in memory of a fellow officer gunned down
as he drove his patrol car in the Crenshaw area, and the manhunt
continued for his killer. At roll calls, watch commanders convened
somber sessions, where they reinforced advice for officers to
ensure their safety: constantly be aware of their surroundings,
always look up and down the street, be safe in approaching radio
calls, be aware of possible ambushes. Funeral arrangements were
pending for Officer Filbert Cuesta, 26, of Norwalk, who was shot in

   LA-BUGS (Los Angeles) _ It is a summer only a bug could love.
High temperatures and a sudden surge in humidity have the local
insect population in pest heaven, following a spring practically
designed for their procreation. Ants are everywhere, anything that
feeds on grass is having a field day and the spiders that eat other
bugs couldn't be doing better. Los Angeles County officials have

   On Friday morning, Mrs. Grady-Huskey took her two children _
Christopher, who is 8, and Caroline, who is 5 _ to the embassy
doctor for a routine checkup. She had planned to meet her husband,
James Huskey, a political officer at the embassy, after the
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor's office is in the basement of the embassy, in
downtown Nairobi, next to a parking garage. They were running late
for their 10 a.m. appointment. Mrs. Grady-Huskey parked her gray
Honda Accord in the lot behind the embassy, just two cars down from
a covered pickup truck that FBI investigators now suspect was
packed with explosives.
</P>
<P>
   It was 10:33 a.m., she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Grady-Huskey led her children down a parking ramp and
through a door and hurried along a corridor to the doctor's office.
A few seconds later, they heard a small explosion, a loud pop, like
a grenade going off.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more minute later, the whole thing blew up and we were on
the floor screaming,'' Mrs. Grady-Huskey said. ``We found each
other in the darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband was at a meeting in the ambassador's office on the
fourth floor when the car bomb detonated with an explosive force
that bomb experts now estimate equaled hundreds of pounds of
dynamite. The bomb flattened a seven-story building next to the
embassy, gutted most of the mission and broke windows for 10
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   When the explosion shattered the windows and shook the
foundation, Huskey knew his family was supposed to be in the
doctor's office in the basement. He ran through a ruined hallway
and stumbled down a central stairwell. With each step, he
encountered more destruction, more blood, more bodies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the basement, Mrs. Grady-Huskey, wrapped in darkness and
chaos, decided they had to get out.
</P>
<P>
   She found her children by touch, and they began crawling back
through the wrecked hallway. They crawled and scrambled over rubble
and cement blocks and through thick black smoke. She held onto her
little girl's hand, and Caroline held onto her brother.
</P>
<P>
   The family encountered a critically injured woman and had to
cross over her. They pressed on. There was no light, and they could
find no opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really concerned when I was crawling through with my
kids that I didn't find a hole,'' she said. ``Then I saw a light.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother and children made it through a doorway that had been
half destroyed and walked up the parking-lot ramp into a world
turned into an inferno. Where the parking lot had been there were
only the carcasses of cars, smoke, fire, rubble and charred bodies.
Mrs. Grady-Huskey and her children staggered around the building
toward the entrance, but ran into a fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole place was on fire,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey had made his way down four flights of stairs and had
staggered out the front of the embassy with the rest of the
traumatized and bleeding staff. He ran around the south corner of
the building.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like a wall of fire, he said. Then he saw his
5-year-old daughter behind a metal fence, covered with soot,
screaming, ``Daddy! Daddy!'' Then he saw his son, then his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you the most important experience of my life was
rounding that corner and thinking my family was dead and seeing the
fire in the background and my little girl,'' he recalled. ``It was
just an incredible feeling.'' With help from other men standing
nearby, he pried apart the bars so they could get out.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Grady-Huskey said: ``We are alive. I am terribly sad that
so many of our friends are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Huskey, who has been helping with the gruesome job of
identifying embassy employees killed in the blast, went down to the
mission's parking lot to examine the remains of his car. His
daughter had left her favorite doll inside and he had a vague hope
of recovering it.
</P>
<P>
   The Honda had been reduced to a blackened shell. Rescue workers
had picked it up and stacked it on top of some other wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty seconds earlier, they would have been evaporated,'' he
said. ``It's just luck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To have four members of one family in that embassy and to
survive is just beyond imagination,'' he added.
</P>

TOMJANOVICH EARNS INSIDE TRACK TO OLYMPIC COACHING JOB
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ Rudy Tomjanovich was whipped.
</P>
<P>
   He had just draped a bronze medal around his neck after a
whirlwind 33-day adventure coaching stand-in American players
during the 13th World Championship of Basketball. Before that, he
had exhausted himself with an NBA draft in which the Rockets had
three first-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   All this came after an 82-game regular season and the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a break,'' Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that putting in the equivalent of five weeks of
overtime to coach the U.S. national team was a grueling prospect.
But Tomjanovich couldn't help saying that if he had it to do all
over again, he would. Without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   He may get the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Warren S. Brown, executive director of USA Basketball, said
after the U.S. charged to third place in the World Championship
that Tomjanovich would ``be the first name on the list'' of
coaching candidates to guide the Americans in the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The only question is whether Tomjanovich would be interesting in
investing another summer _ probably one that will require him to be
busier than this one, which came during the lockout of NBA players
with Rockets basketball operations at a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   He removed all doubt after leading the U.S. to a 7-2 record in
the World Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I'd do it,'' Tomjanovich said sheepishly after being
pinned down on the question of whether he would like to coach the
Olympic team. ``I'd have to. It's your duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown doesn't have the job of selecting the coaches who will
lead U.S. teams into international competition. A selection
committee handles that process.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown does have a strong leadership role with USA
Basketball, and he was thrilled to learn Tomjanovich is amenable to
the 2000 job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make that decision,'' Brown said. ``But I can't
believe that he won't be the first name on the list. It would be
wonderful if he would. I don't make that decision. But I can tell
you he's going to get every consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that whole (coaching) staff, with Rudy leading
it, would be leading the pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the way Tomjanovich, along with assistant coaches Del
Harris of the Los Angeles Lakers and Lon Kruger of the University
of Illinois, handled the situation of NBA players being removed
from the U.S. squad and replaced by Americans from the Continental
Basketball Association, college and European leagues has left a
strong impression on the higher-ups with USA Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we started with this thing about a month ago, we didn't
have any names on the team,'' Brown said. ``We had a coaching staff
that stepped up to the starting line, despite whatever else was
going on. It's hard to put a worth on that, because that kind of
drive was going to happen from then on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy and Del and Lon stepped up and said: `It doesn't make any
difference (who they coached). We want to coach for our country.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So I think the coaching staff drove the whole thing. And what
can you say about the team? They didn't ask for anything, just to
be able to play and represent their country,'' Brown said. ``And I
couldn't be more proud of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure makes you appreciate what players and coaches who want
to do a job will do. And the results are that much more
pleasurable. I do think it has more meaning in that light.''
</P>
<P>
   As Tomjanovich was quick to point out, the commitment of the
players deserves recognition. And if they hadn't respected
Tomjanovich's philosophy and strategy, they probably never would
have gotten to the medal stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we stepped into a difficult situation, and we fought
hard,'' said Ashraf Amaya, one of three centers who shined as a
strength of the team. ``I believe we represented our country to the
best of our ability and think we did a very good job of it. I hope
the majority of people back home will believe that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear: The people at USA Basketball have come to
know and love the effort of Tomjanovich and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy is just terrific,'' Brown said. ``The players listen to
him, and they know where he's coming from. He treats them even and
tells them the way it is. They won because his philosophy of being
tough-minded and keeping focused prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to discount the players. But the combination of
the coaching staff we had and the kind of players who wanted to
step up results in this. It's a great, great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The reward was equally gratifying for Tomjanovich.
</P>
<P>
   ``My association with USA Basketball has been great,'' he said.
``They're good people, and they've supported me. It was a great
tournament, with a lot of guys out there playing their hearts out
for their country.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich coaching in the Olympics makes more sense now than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Until NBA players were involved, coaches worked their way up the
international ladder with USA Basketball before coaching in an
Olympic Games, perhaps coaching in Pan American Games or other
competitions first.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past two Olympics, Chuck Daly and Lenny Wilkens were
the coaches to lead the U.S. teams, despite limited prior
international experience, because the decision was made to have NBA
coaches leading NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tomjanovich has international coaching experience in
addition to being a well-respected NBA coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a thought that NBA players need an NBA coach and
everybody should get an opportunity, because it doesn't come along
very often,'' Brown said. ``But this is kind of an unusual
circumstance. I think Rudy is a front-runner (for the 2000 job)
going in, if he wants to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make the decision, but I know in conversations with
those who do that they really respect the way he stepped up. And
then how he handled this team. He's proven he can do it.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: CLINTON'S EDUCATING OF AMERICA
 &HT;    For release on or after Sunday, August 16.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly six years ago, a youthful Bill Clinton
strode into the capital, armed with ``Putting People First,'' a
book that set out his sweeping promises for America and great
expectations for his energized new presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Now as he faces a grand jury appearance that could determine his
place in history, Clinton's exuberant charm and public appeal are
little diminished by the anxiety that surrounds him in the Monica
Lewinsky matter. But the prospects for fulfilling the promises of
his presidency are growing ever dimmer.
</P>
<P>
   So many opportunities have been lost already. His health care
overhaul plan crashed; his vow to have the most ethical
administration in history was buried in independent counsel probes
of himself and six of his appointees; and he receives little credit
for balancing the budget, since that came after heavy pressure from
the Republican-led Congress and a windfall of revenues from the
soaring economy.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the public links that economic boom to Clinton and
gives him high ratings for job performance. But historians give few
points for greatness to presidents who merely preside over a period
of prosperity. Moreover, this upswing began the year before Clinton
took office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton last year openly launched a campaign to secure a legacy,
and the White House even consulted academics about how he might
build one. But his second term has been consumed by road trips to
raise millions of dollars for his party (with events to boost his
policies sandwiched between fund-raisers to assure that most of the
costs will be paid by taxpayers), travel abroad that accomplished
little, and the current scandal over his unexplained relations with
former 21-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Who can recall the central goal that he set for his last term as
an elective official introduced in his State of the Union address
in 1997?
</P>
<P>
   ``(M)y number one priority for the next four years is to ensure
that all Americans have the best education in the world,'' Clinton
said as he unfurled his easily forgettable action plan before
Congress. By singling out education, Clinton picked a concern that
ranks high on public opinion surveys, but he also chose an area
where the federal government has only a modest role.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year and a half later, what has happened to the
``national crusade for education standards'' that he announced?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  National testing in reading and math: Never implemented.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Federal assistance to repair crumbling school buildings: Never
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A proposal to hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size:
Going nowhere in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Increasing the Head Start preschool program to one million
children: Ignored by Congress amid studies indicating that the
popular program for low-income youngsters offers few lasting
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Two other proposals have passed, but their contribution to
education is debatable:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Clinton's much publicized plan to wire up every classroom to
the computer Internet's ``information highway'' has hit potholes on
the on-ramp. His federal subsidy program, approved in 1996, has yet
to distribute its first dollar to a school. And telephone fees that
finance the program are being challenged in court as an
unconstitutional tax.
</P>
<P>
   And there's another big catch. Computerizing all classrooms
could turn out to be a colossal waste of billions of dollars. It is
widely acknowledged that research has yet to prove that computers
or the Internet boost academic achievement, and some experts say
high tech teaching could be a detriment in the early grades.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The president's proposal to give $1,500 in tax credits for two
years of college tuition was enacted in 1997. That's a boon to
eligible families, but it makes the tax code more complex and less
fair. And if history is a guide, the federal aid will eventually
prompt colleges to hike tuitions that have long far outpaced the
rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Among his less visible moves, Clinton pressured Congress to
spend more for education. He also established a new literacy
program in which colleges provide volunteers as tutors for
elementary students. But he stopped repeating his 1996 election
campaign vow that this ``America Reads'' program would be a
nationwide ``army of volunteers'' assuring that every child will be
reading proficiently by the end of the third grade by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   And for all of his proposals for education, Clinton's
significant impact could be the one that involves neither money nor
programs, but the example that he has set for the younger
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Character education must be taught in the schools,'' he said
in his State of the Union message last year. ``We must teach our
children to be good citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has taught a lesson in questionable character for the
past seven months by leaving a cloud of suspicion over his office
so thick that it's difficult to find anyone who truly believes
Clinton's adamant denial that he had a sexual liaison with ``that
woman Miss Lewinsky,'' as he has told the nation last January.
</P>
<P>
   This Clinton character course has brought into family living
rooms, live from the White House and delivered by sometimes
blushing newscasters, reports that would have been unthinkable not
long ago _ about oral sex, a semen-stained dress, and presidential
kneepads.
</P>
<P>
   Children, who can hardly have missed the gist of the adult
conversations, have asked, ``Did the president lie?'' as their
parents have been left to answer, ``Well, if he did, you still must
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless Clinton can explain himself this coming week, that will
be his legacy to education and to the country.

MORE TICKS. THANKS, EL NINO  
 (FOR RELEASE ON SUNDAY, AUG. 16.) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.M., Ariz., Ga., N.Y., Conn., Mass., Md., Maine, Wis.,
Minn., Mich.)   (af/ll)  
 By SUSAN GILBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL Nino may seem like a distant memory, but the mild, wet
weather it brought to much of the country this year has helped
spawn outbreaks of several illnesses in popular vacation spots.
</P>
<P>
   With lush vegetation for food and shelter, rodents are
proliferating, public health experts say, and so are the diseases
that they spread. Hantavirus, a deadly infection, has returned to
the Southwest, and tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease are
spreading in most states.
</P>
<P>
   No parks or other travel destinations have closed, and travel
doctors have not been advising vacationers to cancel their plans.
``But travelers might want to be extra cautious this year,'' said
Dr. Clarence J. Peters, chief of the special pathogens branch of
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving home, Peters said, people should learn about the
illnesses that are common or emerging in their destinations. To
help, the CDC, the National Park Service and some state health
departments have brochures and postings on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone traveling to rural areas of the Southwest should take
precautions against hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, an incurable
virus that can kill within hours of infection. The CDC has counted
106 cases, including 35 deaths since 1994. There have been 3 deaths
in Colorado and New Mexico this year, according to those states.
</P>
<P>
   All of the infections occurred in rural areas where the deer
mice, which harbor the virus, live. People become infected when
they inhale dust contaminated with mouse urine or feces. Travelers
can guard against hantavirus by staying away from the rodents, as
well as their burrows, which are small holes in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Peters recommends that campers use a tent with a floor and lock
food in a cooler. If you camp in a cabin, open the doors and
windows half an hour before going inside. Doing so will clear the
air of the rodents' urine spray and kill the viruses.
</P>
<P>
   More information on preventing hantavirus is available on the
CDC's Web site (www.cdc.gov) and in brochures from the National
Park Service. The brochures can be found at some national parks or
on the Park Service site (www.nps.gov).
</P>
<P>
   The same weather that has promoted hantavirus has caused a rise
in plague in the Southwest. Though people tend to think of plague
as a disease from the history books, there are usually about 10 to
20 cases a year, mainly in New Mexico and Arizona, Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   Plague bacteria are carried by fleas and spread from rodents,
rabbits and domestic animals to people. The number of people with
plague has held steady this year so far, but public health
officials are seeing a sharp increase in the number of rodents and
domestic cats with the disease, which they fear could herald an
increase in human infections.
</P>
<P>
   Frightening as that sounds, the threat to travelers is small,
said Dr. Paul Ettestad, a public health veterinarian with the New
Mexico Department of Health in Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   ``People going to standard tourist areas, like national parks,
are not at increased risk,'' Ettestad said. ``There's more
potential for infection if you're camping, but you can take
precautions.''
</P>
<P>
   As with hantavirus, Ettestad said, hikers and campers should
avoid rodents and their burrows and protect themselves with an
insecticide containing DEET. (Children should use preparations with
no more than 10 percent DEET.) People traveling with cats and dogs
should dust them with flea powder and not let them roam free.
</P>
<P>
   Plague is curable if it is treated promptly. Symptoms include
sudden fever, chills, headache and extremely swollen and tender
lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
   Infections spread by ticks appear to be on the rise this summer,
experts say. By far the most prevalent one is Lyme disease, with
nearly 13,000 cases reported to the CDC last year. David Weld,
executive director of the American Lyme Disease Foundation, a
research and education group in Somers, N.Y., said deer ticks,
which transmit Lyme disease, are more abundant this summer in
established trouble spots, like Long Island, the Hudson Valley and
the shoreline from Connecticut to Massachusetts, as well as in the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Weld said, the ticks are spreading to new
territories, including upstate New York, Florida and California. As
with all tick-borne illnesses, the earlier Lyme disease is treated,
the more easily it can be cured. Symptoms include a rash that looks
like a red dot and then expands, as well as headache, fever and
muscle aches.
</P>
<P>
   Though far less common than Lyme disease, with just a few
hundred cases a year, several other tick-borne illnesses that are
spreading more rapidly are more dangerous, public health experts
say. Ehrlichiosis occurs in the same areas as Lyme disease.
Babesiosis is found mainly on the East Coast from Maryland to Maine
and in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis and babesiosis are transmitted
by deer ticks. But the infections are harder to identify because
there is no rash, and they can be fatal if they are not treated,
Weld said. Ehrlichiosis symptoms include severe headache, chills,
vomiting and high fever.
</P>
<P>
   Babesiosis symptoms are a spiking fever and sweats that come and
go. These are fairly new diseases; there are no diagnostic tests
and many doctors do not know about them, said Dr. Richard Falco, a
scientific adviser to the American Lyme Disease Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get ill when you get back to your home state,'' Falco
said, ``let your doctor know that you were in an area where X
tick-borne illness occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potentially deadly tick-borne illness is Rocky Mountain
spotted fever, which occurs in most states, chiefly in the South
and Southeast, Falco said. Several hundred people are infected each
year, he said, and the chance of dying is 25 percent without early
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The first symptoms include fever, loss of appetite and a mild
headache followed two to six days later by small pink spots on the
wrists and ankles, which spread across the body. Rocky Mountain
spotted fever is transmitted by the lone star tick and the American
dog tick.
</P>
<P>
   Standard measures used against other tick-borne illnesses apply.
For example, when hiking, walking or camping in grassy or wooded
areas, apply a tick repellent that contains DEET to your shoes and
legs. More information is available from the American Lyme Disease
Foundation: (914) 277-6970.
</P>
<P>
   The best defense against tick-borne infections is to examine
yourself and your children after being outdoors, Falco said. Remove
ticks by pulling them out with tweezers or one of the tools
designed for this purpose, like Ticked Off.
</P>
<P>
   Time is on your side: it takes 36 to 48 hours from the time a
tick attaches itself to the body until it can transmit Lyme
disease, 24 to 48 hours to transmit ehrlichiosis or babesiosis and
3 to 24 hours to transmit Rocky Mountain fever. Routine tick
checks, Falco said, can reduce the chance of illness to almost
nothing.

   The crossing, over 200 miles of open ocean, is the most
dangerous leg of the 1,500-mile voyage to Newfoundland from
Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, now that I've been doing this for four days, that
crossing the Davis Strait in an open boat is a crazy thing,''
Carter said by e-mail on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in attempting to make the same journey, the Snorri
lost a rudder in the middle of the Davis Strait and had to be towed
back to Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   The Maine-built Snorri is an open boat, powered only by oars and
a sail. It has no shelter below decks; crew members sleep under
tarps on deck. The boat is equipped with radios, a compass, a
global positioning system unit, and a laptop computer. Otherwise,
conditions on board closely mimic those of an actual Viking ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a huge range of conditions,'' said Carter, a
writer-adventurer from West Virginia and son of former State
Department spokesman Hodding Carter. ``Strong winds from the south,
strong winds from the north. Huge swells _ huge in an open boat at
least, because they were eight to 12 feet high and would send waves
of water right over the bow watch at 2 in morning _ my least
favorite job.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said his crew is ``holding up well, sleeping in shifts in
our little underway tarp. It's a little ripe in there from all the
spray and rain and sweat, but we barely notice it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Snorri left Nuuk, Greenland, on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're much closer'' to completing the voyage, ``and we seem to
be able to make tiny repairs as needed,'' Carter said. ``I don't
know what will happen, but I have complete confidence in our boat,
our captain, and our crew. This is a great experience, and it makes
the Viking accomplishments so much clearer and incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter and his crew hope to reach L'Anse aux Meadows,
Newfoundland _ identified as an early Viking settlement _ by
mid-September.

GUARD'S PRE-BOMB SIGHTING OF TRUCK MAY PROVIDE CLUE TO IDENTITY OF
TERRORISTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Kenyan guard at the shattered American Embassy in
Nairobi and others who saw a light truck approach the embassy
compound minutes before the explosion may provide important clues
to the identify of the terrorists who carried out the attack,
Clinton administration officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy guard, whose name has not been released, has told
American investigators that he refused to allow the truck through
the gate and that, as a result, one of the occupants of the truck
jumped from the car and opened fire on him, possibly throwing hand
grenades. The guard said he ran for his life. Moments later, he
said, a bomb in the truck exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story has to be verified, but if it's true, he really did
a tremendous job,'' Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering said
of the guard. If the truck had gotten past the gate and into the
basement parking lot of the embassy, Pickering said in an
interview, ``the whole building might have come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Kenyans who say they witnessed the blast offer a similar
account of a truck bomb.
</P>
<P>
   American investigators hope their description of the pickup
truck and its passengers could help identify the terrorists who
carried out the attack in Nairobi last Friday and the nearly
simultaneous bombing of the American Embassy in Dar es Salaam, the
capital of neighboring Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday in Nairobi, Ochieng Okwach, a
42-year-old driver for the Kenyan national parks service, said that
he was stopped in traffic about 50 yards from the embassy when he
saw a yellow pickup truck with an enclosed cargo area try to back
through the embassy's rear gate toward the underground parking
garage, stopping about five yards from the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, he said, a man leaped from the back of the truck
wearing a blue guard uniform that appeared identical to the ones
worn by security guards who protect both the parking lot and the
embassy's front entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who carried a black object the size of a walkie-talkie
in his right hand, made a throwing motion toward the embassy,
Okwach said. A small explosion followed.
</P>
<P>
   According to Okwach's account, the uniformed man ran back to the
truck and jumped in, a moment before the pickup truck exploded in a
powerful fireball that rocked the embassy and caused the collapse
of a nearby office building. ``I thought it was some robbers
wanting to rob the bank,'' he said. ``When I heard that blast, I
said, `Oh, God, it is the end of the world.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although his account would suggest that the passengers in the
truck were killed in the explosion, possibly in an act of suicide,
American officials say they have no evidence to date to show what
happened to the terrorists _ whether they died in the explosion,
were among those injured, or fled.
</P>
<P>
   Okwach said that he had not been interviewed by any American
officials, nor by the local police.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Pickering, who has helped direct the State
Department's response to the explosions in Kenya and Tanzania, said
that the guard at the embassy in Nairobi has reported that he first
noticed the light truck ``as it approached the embassy gate that he
was guarding.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the guard's account, Pickering said, the truck
``made a circle or turned around or something of that sort and
someone in the front seat asked the guard to open the gates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When he refused, somebody got out of the truck with what
appeared to be hand grenades,'' he said. ``He threatened the guard
and then began to throw hand grenades at him _ hand grenades or
some sort of long tubes. He did not open the gate and he ran. And
as he ran, there was a huge explosion that threw him to the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering said that he did not know the condition of the guard
or whether he had been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very important to say that this is a story that
has to be confirmed,'' he said. ``But if it indeed is true, then
obviously it appears that the guard did not allow the truck to
penetrate the gate. He obviously did a very helpful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said that investigators are
sifting through rubble at the embassy in Nairobi in search of
evidence of the truck that may have carried the explosives. Even
tiny fragments of the truck, they say, may allow them to identify
the make and model of the vehicle and its owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, we want to match the eyewitness accounts to the
physical evidence of the truck,'' said an administration official
who is involved in the investigations in Kenya and Tanzania,
speaking on condition that he not be identified. ``If we can match
it up, history shows that we're on our way to identifying the
perpetrators.''
</P>
<P>
   American investigators and embassy officials in Nairobi have
dismissed other reports about the explosion that have supposedly
come from witnesses, including one report suggesting that a truck
used in the bombing had American diplomatic license plates. ``There
are lots of rumors,'' said William Barr, an embassy spokesman in
Nairobi.

APPLE REPORTS 150,000 ORDERS FOR NEW IMAC MACINTOSH IN ONE WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Apple Computer said on Monday that it had
received more than 150,000 orders for its new iMac Macintosh
computer since the company began taking orders a week ago. The
iMac, which is aimed at the consumer and education markets, goes on
sale on Aug. 15 at a suggested retail price of $1,299.
</P>
<P>
   Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., has high hopes for the iMac,
which features a translucent green case, an integrated monitor and
an illuminated mouse, and some analysts have estimated that the
company could sell more than 1 million of the new machine in its
first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest first week order Apple has ever gotten for
any new product,'' Steven Jobs, Apple's interim president and chief
executive, said in a telephone interview. ``The channel is going
pretty crazy for this,'' Jobs added, referring to personal computer
dealers and distributors, many of whom have been accepting advance
customer orders for the iMac for months, but could only order from
Apple beginning on Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Apple shares closed at $37.9375, up $1.4375, in
Nasdaq trading. For three consecutive quarters, a resurgent Apple
has reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street analysts'
estimates, and many have been counting on a strong start of the
iMac to continue that trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will go nuts in the fourth quarter,'' said Kimball
Brown, an analyst with Dataquest, who said his only reservation
concerned Apple's reliance on a new connection scheme, called USB,
for printers, floppy disk drives and other peripheral devices. But
in schools and offices, where such devices are often shared on a
network, USB is not an issue. ``In education, this is a dream
machine,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The use of USB, or universal system bus, means that the iMac
cannot connect directly to older printers, and there are fewer new
devices using USB than many industry watchers had anticipated at
this time. Yet several companies already offer adaptors that allow
the use of non-USB devices with the iMac, so the problem is not
insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   Apple also had good news on the software front, saying that more
than 460 new or upgraded software applications had been announced
for the Macintosh since the introduction of the iMac on May 6.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's declining market share in recent years had prompted
numerous software developers to abandon the Macintosh, but the
return of Jobs, and Apple's return to profitability, coupled with
excitement over the new machine, have brought many back to the
fold.

BLAST FALLOUT: DEBATE OVER EMBASSY FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Embassy-Reward; i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS AND ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The devastation in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam last
Friday is about to rekindle a political fight in Washington over
the proper funding of embassy security that began over a decade ago
during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the State Department
will ask Congress for more money to secure embassies and consulates
around the world. Budget planners, diplomatic security agents and
architects have started culling requests from ambassadors for
everything from steel doors and bulletproof windows to 24-hour
Marine guard details and other measures at nearly 300 buildings
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   These requests will total billions of dollars, despite the fact
that Congress has not yet approved a foreign affairs budget for
next year that includes a mere $36.1 million for security upgrades
and construction of embassies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, after an independent panel recommended $2.5 billion in
security improvements, Congress balked at spending the money. Even
Senator Richard Lugar, Indiana Republican who is a respected
foreign policy expert, criticized the notion of ``gold-plated''
embassies.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Congress has approved less than $1 billion of the
projects, according to Patrick Kennedy, who oversees the State
Department's administrative offices.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Congress rejected a plan to build a new $200 million
embassy in Beijing and a new embassy of unspecified cost in Berlin,
Germany's new capital. Instead, appropriations committees approved
several million dollars for planning and design of the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress predicted that there will be sentiment after
the August recess for increased spending on embassy security.
Friday's extraordinary blasts dramatized the issue more than any
bureaucrat could. Also, the attacks came just two weeks after a
gunman entered the Capitol, killing two police officers. After
that, Republicans and Democrats alike agreed to increase security
in the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to protect our citizens, we've got to protect our
people who work with us,'' said John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, a
Democrat who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
``Obviously we're going to have to broaden the existing security.
But it's premature to start giving out amounts of money or say
which embassies need more security.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Joe Biden, the top ranking Democrat on the committee,
Monday sent letters to Albright and Foreign Affairs Comittee
chairman Jesse Helms, a Republican, calling for a hearing on
embassy security and more money. Aides to Helms did not return
phone calls, but in the past he has called on the State Department
to use its money more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Fisher, a spokesman for Lugar, who also serves on the
committee, said, ``He has said that we needed to have a larger
request to Congress to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, estimated Congress
will approve an additional $100 million for security. ``Sure, it
will cost a significant amount of money, but it's also costing a
significant amount to pick up all the rubble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The best of intentions still might be sidetracked by political
reality. The 1999 foreign affairs budget is stalled in Congress
because of an unrelated argument over how the next census will be
conducted.
</P>
<P>
   And while the powerful explosions in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam
will increase support for the State Department's security plans,
there is a practical problem as well: simply to rebuild those two
buildings will exhaust the department's budget for new construction
for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has said it is too early to say how much it
will need to rebuild the embassy in Nairobi, which was gutted by
the blast. But a new embassy of comparable size in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia's capital, cost $140 million. And a medium-sized embassies
such as the one that was shattered in Tanzania cost about $30
million.
</P>
<P>
   There is yet another costly complication: since Friday, the
State Department also has had to increase security at several
embassies. ``We're getting a large number of threats coming in,''
Kennedy said. ``Some of them could conceivably be real. Some of
them simply may be copycats.''
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign service officers Monday complained that the US
efforts to save money have unfairly jeopardized their security. By
law, the State Department must do business with the lowest bidder
of all the companies that want to provide security agents at
embassies. In Kenya and Tanzania and many other countries,
officials said, the companies did not provide life insurance or
retirement plans for the guards.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, State Department employees were asked to donate money to
the widows of several guards who were killed. ``That's an
outrage!'' one veteran Foreign Service officer said. ``Can't our
government provide that benefit for people who risk their lives for
us?''

`FELICITY' STAR'S PRIMED FOR PRIME TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD - Keri Russell perches on a make-up chair in Hollywood
Saturday night with a cellular phone glued to her ear and harried
photographers hovering around her.
</P>
<P>
   She's on the set of the WB Network's most touted and envied new
sitcom, ``Felicity,'' and everyone is competing for the 22-year-old
Mesa, Ariz., native's attention. With filming going on and
interview requests pouring in from such media moguls as ``Time,''
``Newsweek,`` `` Rolling Stone,`` ``Entertainment Weekly,`` ``USA
Today ''and ``Seventeen,'' Russell's learning how quickly life can
change.
</P>
<P>
   Already, she has been been featured on ``Entertainment
Tonight.'' Already, ``USA Today'' has noted the heaps of hype
heading Russell's way. And her show doesn't debut for another six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrifying, to tell you the truth,'' she said. ``I don't
know how to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The hubbub is a far cry from her childhood spent at a ballet bar
in the Mesa Stars dance studio, though even then Russell seemed
primed for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the kind of person you believe would do it,'' said Stars
director Bobbi Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   That's also what TV critics, advertising agencies, and competing
networks are saying about ``Felicity,'' a sitcom about a freshman
(Russell) at New York University that is billed as ``Ally McBeal
goes to college.''
</P>
<P>
   How did the mostly unknown star of an unseen show on an itty
bitty startup network become the hottest new TV face of 1998?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever seen anything like this,'' said Laura
Caraccioli, director of TV programing for the Chicago advertising
agency Leo Burnett. ``Not with a new face. Nobody's familiar with
her. It's happened before when people come to TV from the theater
or move from theatricals to the small screen, but nothing like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Caraccioli doesn't directly buy commercial time for advertisers,
but advises her agency's clients on television trends. Her thick
preseason report is widely distributed in the TV world, which began
to stir about ``Felicity'' and its young star way back in March,
when the WB brought a short clip of scenes from the show to
preliminary meetings with advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The WB had just launched the teen-appeal drama ``Dawson's
Creek.'' Thanks to that show and ``Buffy, The Vampire Slayer,'' the
fledgling network was beginning to generate some buzz of its own.
The ``Felicity'' clip stood out, and Russell made an excellent
first impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the buzz started there, back in March,'' said
Caracioli.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing ``Felicity'' has in its corner is its Imagine
Television production auspices. Its young creators, J.J. Abrams and
Matt Reeves, have bankable feature film credits (``Armageddon,``
``Regarding Henry,`` ``The Pallbearer``), and Ron Howard is one of
its executive producers.
</P>
<P>
   Russell lived in Mesa from age 1 to 13. Her family - parents
David and Stephanie, older brother Todd and younger sister Julie -
now live in Dallas, but when ``Felicity'' premieres, there will be
a hometown fan section in the Phoenix area. Friends have tracked
Russell's budding career since her years on the ``Mickey Mouse
Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Stars dancer Joni McKeen hasn't seen Russell since a trip
to Florida in 1994, but sometimes she'll catch a glimpse of her
famous friend on the living room TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just turned it on, saw her, and called my mom _ `guess who's
on TV!' '' said Manguso on Russell's ``Seventh Heaven'' sitcom
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   When dance teacher Rogers caught Russell as the babysitter on
``Honey, I Blew Up the Kids,'' her reaction was similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going `oh my gosh _ is that Keri? We knew her when she
was little,' '' she said. ``You just don't think . . . but everyone
always wanted to be like her.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially her hair, says Manguso, who followed Keri's curls in
Mesa as closely as she follows her career now.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister and I paid extra money so we could go to Keri's
stylist and have her hair, but it never looked the same,'' said
Manguso. ``We were all going through our ugly stage then, and she
was still so pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Russell's superiors took her lead. ``I even went to Jo
(Keri's stylist),'' said Rogers. ``But I look back at those
pictures and want to die!''
</P>
<P>
   Russell is flattered, but doesn't understand the idolatry. ``You
are killing me right now,'' she said, laughing at the story. ``It's
an afro!''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, come the show's Sept. 29 debut, watch Keri's curly
look be as requested as Jennifer Aniston's sought-after ``Friends''
shag _ a sign of true stardom.
</P>
<P>
   But the 'fro fans may run into trouble, because Russell's locks
turned naturally wavy at 16. And that's OK with Russell, who thinks
natural is the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lack of real girls on TV right now,'' she said.
``There's all of the thick eyeliner and fake boobs, but Felicity is
more like girls in real life _ she's smart and wears big sweaters
and ponytails, and I think girls need to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``real'' quality is what attracted Russell, who ``never
wanted to be an actor,'' to the role in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with this story and what she represents,'' said
Russell. ``I think and feel everything Felicity says, but I don't
always show it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have this editing device in our brain that tells us
`oh, that won't make you very cool,' but Felicity doesn't have that
emotional relationship savviness.''
</P>
<P>
   This raw style is part of what critics say is making Russell
great.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so powerful (in the pilot), she just jumped right out
of the screen at you. Something in her eyes,'' said ad exec
Caracioli.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't have to speak, and she speaks volumes.''
</P>
<P>
   This May, when the expanded ``Felicity'' pilot began making the
rounds of advertisers and TV critics, the buzz grew into a small
roar.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nearly 40 new shows that will debut this fall,
``Felicity'' clearly was one of the few with a chance to become a
critical and commercial hit. ``It just blew most of us away,`` said
Caracioli. ``It was one of the most well-done pilots. You felt like
you were watching a theatrical release.''
</P>
<P>
   But all of this buzz about Russell is making her job harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There definitely is more pressure when everyone's expecting
you to deliver,'' she said. ``But on the flip side, it's really
great to have this much attention _ it feels too good to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell, however, hits ground quickly as she realizes she's been
working until 5 a.m. each morning without a weekend off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm exhausted,'' she said. ``Sleep would be a good thing right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   But an agent beckons and Russell is summoned from her dreams of
restful felicity to the flurry of photographers awaiting their new
shining star.

BLAST FALLOUT: DEBATE OVER EMBASSY FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Embassy-Reward; i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS AND ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The devastation in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam last
Friday is about to rekindle a political fight in Washington over
the proper funding of embassy security that began over a decade ago
during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the State Department
will ask Congress for more money to secure embassies and consulates
around the world. Budget planners, diplomatic security agents and
architects have started culling requests from ambassadors for
everything from steel doors and bulletproof windows to 24-hour
Marine guard details and other measures at nearly 300 buildings
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   These requests will total billions of dollars, despite the fact
that Congress has not yet approved a foreign affairs budget for
next year that includes a mere $36.1 million for security upgrades
and construction of embassies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, after an independent panel recommended $2.5 billion in
security improvements, Congress balked at spending the money. Even
Senator Richard Lugar, Indiana Republican who is a respected
foreign policy expert, criticized the notion of ``gold-plated''
embassies.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Congress has approved less than $1 billion of the
projects, according to Patrick Kennedy, who oversees the State
Department's administrative offices.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Congress rejected a plan to build a new $200 million
embassy in Beijing and a new embassy of unspecified cost in Berlin,
Germany's new capital. Instead, appropriations committees approved
several million dollars for planning and design of the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress predicted that there will be sentiment after
the August recess for increased spending on embassy security.
Friday's extraordinary blasts dramatized the issue more than any
bureaucrat could. Also, the attacks came just two weeks after a
gunman entered the Capitol, killing two police officers. After
that, Republicans and Democrats alike agreed to increase security
in the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to protect our citizens, we've got to protect our
people who work with us,'' said John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, a
Democrat who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
``Obviously we're going to have to broaden the existing security.
But it's premature to start giving out amounts of money or say
which embassies need more security.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Joe Biden, the top ranking Democrat on the committee,
Monday sent letters to Albright and Foreign Affairs Comittee
chairman Jesse Helms, a Republican, calling for a hearing on
embassy security and more money. Aides to Helms did not return
phone calls, but in the past he has called on the State Department
to use its money more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Fisher, a spokesman for Lugar, who also serves on the
committee, said, ``He has said that we needed to have a larger
request to Congress to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, estimated Congress
will approve an additional $100 million for security. ``Sure, it
will cost a significant amount of money, but it's also costing a
significant amount to pick up all the rubble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The best of intentions still might be sidetracked by political
reality. The 1999 foreign affairs budget is stalled in Congress
because of an unrelated argument over how the next census will be
conducted.
</P>
<P>
   And while the powerful explosions in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam
will increase support for the State Department's security plans,
there is a practical problem as well: simply to rebuild those two
buildings will exhaust the department's budget for new construction
for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has said it is too early to say how much it
will need to rebuild the embassy in Nairobi, which was gutted by
the blast. But a new embassy of comparable size in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia's capital, cost $140 million. And a medium-sized embassies
such as the one that was shattered in Tanzania cost about $30
million.
</P>
<P>
   There is yet another costly complication: since Friday, the
State Department also has had to increase security at several
embassies. ``We're getting a large number of threats coming in,''
Kennedy said. ``Some of them could conceivably be real. Some of
them simply may be copycats.''
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign service officers Monday complained that the US
efforts to save money have unfairly jeopardized their security. By
law, the State Department must do business with the lowest bidder
of all the companies that want to provide security agents at
embassies. In Kenya and Tanzania and many other countries,
officials said, the companies did not provide life insurance or
retirement plans for the guards.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, State Department employees were asked to donate money to
the widows of several guards who were killed. ``That's an
outrage!'' one veteran Foreign Service officer said. ``Can't our
government provide that benefit for people who risk their lives for
us?''
</P>
<P>
   The State Deparment keeps a list of embassies that need to be
``hardened,'' starting with those in the most dangerous regions.
But the simultaneous attacks in two tranquil East African countries
have rocked the notion of high- and low-risk sites.
</P>
<P>
   Even one of the administration officials familiar with overseas
security operations was skeptical of the talk of pouring money into
new embassies. ``You can spend billions of dollars,'' he said about
the fight against terrorists, ``but a lot of it comes down is
getting human intelligence.''

 &HT;    Now that agreement has been reached, BellSouth has unique
opportunityBy Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Having passed a high-stakes contract confrontation and
avoided a strike, BellSouth has a chance to use cooperation _ and
advice _ from workers as a way to maintain fast growth.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement hashed out late Saturday with the Communications
Workers of America sets BellSouth apart from other regional phone
companies _ especially from Bell Atlantic, where contract talks
broke down and 73,000 workers headed for picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between Atlanta-based BellSouth and the CWA produced a
three-year contract that would cover 48,000 of the company's 86,188
employees. Assuming the agreement is ratified, workers will receive
a 12.39 percent wage increase and a healthier pension package,
although BellSouth budged only a bit on its policy of forcing
employees to work overtime.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides also created a committee that could oversee
operations, recommend rules for revision and monitor the way change
is carried out.
</P>
<P>
   The joint operations board would include CWA and company
officials and have power to consider worker proposals for changing
how jobs are done, to propose training that will let workers shift
into new jobs and to suggest bonuses. Mainly, the board would give
union members an alternative to filing formal complaints or waiting
until the next set of contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In a rapidly changing industry, both company and union wanted
another option.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth spokeswoman Deborah Spicer cited the changes since the
1995 agreement: passage of the Telecommunications Act, increased
competition and BellSouth's growth. ``Doing things in the same old
environment and expecting better results will not work.''
</P>
<P>
   The joint board will review employee suggestions for improving
the way work is done, she said. ``Changing processes under the old
system can be clunky.''
</P>
<P>
   The board will have no official power _ but it will include
members who do.
</P>
<P>
   Noah Savant, CWA assistant to the vice president for the
Southeast, said the board will protect worker rights and give union
workers a better shot at taking jobs that BellSouth has been
all-too-willing to contract out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have positioned ourselves well for the long-term,
positioned ourselves to add jobs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Few precedents for the board exist. However, a similar
arrangement helped end a bitter strike against the British Columbia
phone company in 1980, ushering in an era of relative labor peace.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Bernard, director of the Trade Union Program at Harvard
University, said unions see their future depends on giving
companies more flexibility, and, in return getting more say in
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk to anybody in the CWA and they know that quality is
about jobs. And they think that management of the industry is too
important to leave to management.''
</P>
<P>
   But how well the board will function and how much influence is
hard to predict, she said. ``Flexibility is often thinly disguised
code for 'anything that management says, goes.'''
</P>
<P>
   At least right now, BellSouth's deal provides a measure of
cooperation that dramatically contrasts with the conflict at Bell
Atlantic. That walkout _ which is made up mostly of CWA workers _
took CWA officials here by surprise. Issues at Bell Atlantic were
similar and the deadline was the same.
</P>
<P>
   What made Bell Atlantic different was partly a history of
confrontations that the CWA does not have in the Southeast.
Relations between the CWA leadership and that of BellSouth have
been mostly amicable _ unlike at Bell Atlantic. For instance,
Nynex, which was purchased by Bell Atlantic, endured a bitter
strike in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But the CWA may also see an opportunity. Bell Atlantic has
recently announced a $55 billion plan to purchase GTE, an idea sure
to confront skepticism among regulators. A grueling strike would be
a public relations black eye, distracting the company when focus is
critical.
</P>
<P>
   While the CWA's northern and southern approaches seem to
diverge, all telecommunications unions face a future radically
different from the world they knew before the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T.
Back then, telephone workers had virtual life tenure in a monopoly
industry that was regulated by government and nearly all unionized.
Now, all that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   For at least five years, BellSouth has joined other regional
phone companies in trimming workforces. BellSouth, for instance,
has slashed its payroll by 16 percent while adding some jobs in
wireless, cable television and international units. Those jobs are
mainly non-union.
</P>
<P>
   More ominous for the union has been the stunning growth of
non-union companies like Sprint and MCI, and even newer entrants
like Qwest and WorldCom who see the old phone companies as
dinosaurs in the coming world of high-speed data.

 &HT;    Holyfield-Bean card holds something for nearly everyone
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Evander Holyfield's homecoming fight card shouldn't be
short of at least two elements: tickets and diversity.
</P>
<P>
   The Holyfield-Vaughn Bean heavyweight title fight Sept. 19,
staged in a Georgia Dome set up for 40,000 seats, will have an
undercard that includes at least one other men's title fight, a
bout featuring women's lightweight champion Christy Martin _ and
possibly a kick-boxing event and musical entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The main event, Holyfield's first fight in Atlanta since a title
defense against Bert Cooper in 1991, will be announced officially
today at a Georgia Dome news conference. Ticket information has not
been completed, but tickets are expected to go on sale Wednesday,
with prices starting at $25. Promoter Don King will push the event
in Atlanta as the last chance for most area residents to see
Holyfield fight live, with the remaining bouts of his career
probably in Las Vegas or Atlantic City. The IBF has ranked Bean No.
1, mandating that Holyfield give him a title shot. But Bean has
built a 31-1 record against largely obscure competition and lost a
decision to his only noteworthy opponent, Michael Moorer, in March
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The the fight will be shown nationally on Showtime during a
``free preview'' weekend, but officials of the cable network are
considering blacking out the broadcast in the Atlanta area.

 &HT;    Gamecock fans looking for Scott to produce FSU-esque season
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When South Carolina named Brad Scott its head football coach in
December 1993, the hiring raised more than a few eyebrows across
the SEC. Scott had earned a reputation as an offensive genius,
after helping Florida State to the 1993 national title as its
offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   As Scott enters his fifth season in Columbia, however, Gamecock
fans are still waiting to catch a glimpse of the success he helped
orchestrate in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Since leading South Carolina to its first-ever bowl win during
his rookie season in 1994, Scott has limped to a 15-17-1 mark over
the past three years. Worse, since Scott's arrival, the Gamecocks
have gone just 1-11 against SEC East opponents Florida, Georgia and
Tennessee. And he has split four games with intrastate rival
Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   ``A .500 record is mediocre, either the best of the worst or the
worst of the best,'' Scott said. ``It's certainly not good enough
for me or the program. Our fans and players need to be involved in
some bowl games. I'm embarrassed our team isn't better,
record-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mediocrity, Scott doesn't appear to be in immediate
trouble at South Carolina. The Gamecocks are coming off a 5-6
campaign, in which starting quarterback Anthony Wright was lost for
the final two games with a season-ending knee injury. Wright is
near full-recovery, and Scott is armed with a contract through the
2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this day and time, any head football coach is always under
the microscope,'' Scott says. ``Expectations are out there every
year. I don't have to buy a publication or listen to talk radio to
figure that out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scott must have listened to some of the criticism _ he
pushed out offensive coordinator John Eason and
quarterbacks/passing game coach John Reaves after last season, when
the Gamecocks finished eighth in total offense and ninth in
rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Former Baylor coach and Clemson assistant Chuck Reedy is the new
offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, and former Alabama
assistant Woody McCorvey was hired to coach receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to run the ball with more authority,'' Scott said.
``We have to be able to convert third-and-shorts. We have gotten
away from a commitment to the run. Chuck Reedy brings us toughness.
He'll have more responsibility than most of my past coordinators.''
</P>
<P>
   A running game would ease some of the pressure on Wright, who
probably won't see full-contact until the Sept. 5 season-opener
against Ball State.
</P>
<P>
   But establishing a ground attack could be tough for Carolina.
Returning tailbacks Troy Hambrick and Boo Williams of Blackshear
combined for just two 100-yard rushing performances last season.
The Gamecocks could start as many as three redshirt freshmen on its
offensive line, including left guard Phillip Jones of Brookwood
High.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier teaching running blocks than drop-back
passing protection,'' Scott said. ``Our success will depend on how
quickly these guys will adjust to being starters. We play our first
four games at home, and I think that will help our young players.''
</P>
<P>
   After the season opener, South Carolina hosts Georgia, Marshall
and Mississippi State in consecutive games at Williams-Brice
Stadium. It will be an important stretch, as South Carolina closes
the regular season with a home game against Tennessee and
back-to-back road dates at Florida and Clemson.

FOR CLINTON, AN UNEXPECTED KIND OF PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House dinner had gone well. But as the
dozen or so guests headed for the exits, President Clinton cornered
a few of them and shared his thoughts on the investigation
engulfing his presidency: Kenneth W. Starr was feeding an appetite
for trivia when he, Clinton, had far more important work to do.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton dared not talk about the specific accusations or his
feelings about his accusers, reflecting a new reality for the
president.
</P>
<P>
   His fight with the independent counsel has made the White House
a lonely place for Clinton. In just a few short months, Starr has
won the right to question Secret Service agents who protect him,
and the White House lawyers whose advice he depends on. He has to
be careful whom he talks to these days and what confidences he
divulges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give people the power to question the president under oath and
this is what you get,'' said David A. Strauss, a University of
Chicago law professor who helped represent Clinton before the
Supreme Court in Clinton v. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the titanic struggle between Starr and Clinton
blame the other for setting in motion a process in which
presidential bodyguards and government lawyers can be summoned
before a grand jury to testify in an investigation stemming from
what most Americans regard as a private matter, a person's sex
life.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's case will be the principal example for future scholars
examining what can happen to the occupant of the nation's highest
office when he is subjected to the uncertainty of a civil lawsuit.
In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that Paula Jones could go forward
with her sexual-harassment claim against Clinton while he was in
office, though with some deference, such as consideration of his
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the discovery process by Jones's lawyers, Monica
Lewinsky became a household name. And Starr's investigation of an
Arkansas land deal has mushroomed to whether Clinton had sex with
the former intern and committed perjury and obstructed justice to
hide it. Along the way, Starr's probe has also focused on possible
improprieties in the White House acquisition of the FBI files of
top Republicans, the suicide of Deputy White House Counsel Vincent
Foster, and the firings of White House travel office employees.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the public chatter about the FBI testing of Lewinsky's
navy blue dress that may contain genetic material from Clinton,
Strauss said, is ``the erosion of the president's ability to
govern.''
</P>
<P>
   For that, he blames Starr. ``If there is going to be a case in
which you are going to force the president's lawyers to talk about
their conversations with the president, it ought to be a much more
important case than this one,'' Strauss said.
</P>
<P>
   C. Boyden Gray, a White House counsel under President Bush,
agrees for different reasons. The Clinton administration is at
fault, he said, for trying to block the testimony of the Secret
Service agents and government lawyers. ``They took the weakest
possible case to legitimate'' those privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Fred F. Fielding, a White House counsel under President Reagan
and deputy counsel under President Nixon, embraces the issue from
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power of the presidency hasn't been diminished only by
these legal setbacks, but by the entire conduct of the White House
during this investigation,'' he said. ``In prior investigations in
the face of criminal charges, every president has waived privileges
and directed his staff to testify, including Richard Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   The court decisions in Starr's investigation have drawn clear
lines around legal issues that most think were better left fuzzy.
Even so, many legal scholars are hard-pressed to disagree with the
rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't that these decisions are necessarily wrong,'' said
Abner Mikva, former Clinton White House counsel now teaching law at
the University of Illinois at Chicago. ``It's that we have pushed
these legal propositions to the extreme. Hard cases make bad law.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can still consult his private attorneys, and he has two
from the best law firms in town. Attorney-client privlege protects
those private lawyers from divulging their confidential
conversations with Clinton, just as it would for any lawyer hired
by the average American.
</P>
<P>
   This president, any president, also retains the right to wield
the powerful tool of executive privilege, which allows the
country's chief executive to claim certain information as
off-limits. Though a federal judge has ruled against the president
on this issue, the White House may yet test it again in court.
</P>
<P>
   The legal rulings regarding privilege could further isolate the
office of the presidency by limiting the candid advice needed from
White House aides, Clinton's supporters say.
</P>
<P>
   In one scenario, a White House lawyer's memos to the president
about a possible nominee might become less explicit. If, for
example, a nominee contributed to the president's election campaign
and later was involved in a criminal investigation, the White House
lawyer could be summoned to testify about his advice to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Garment, who was a White House counsel to Nixon during
Watergate, said his former boss started the ``ball rolling'' by
prompting the independent counsel law. ``It's one of the things he
lamented to me and other people thereafter. He said he really got
them boiled up in the country,'' Garment said. ``Anytime a
president becomes embroiled in litigation, the presidency is
terribly weakened.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Charles O. Jones, a scholar of the presidency at the
University of Wisconsin, said the presidency will bounce back.
``The system has incredible recuperative powers,'' he said. ``We
thought, following Watergate, that the presidency would never be
restored or would take a great long time to be. That just wasn't
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Future presidents will still have the option of invoking
executive privilege for goverment lawyers if they face legal
challenges to their official duties, said Peter J. Wallison, a
White House counsel to Reagan during Iran-Contra. ``I don't see all
this about the presidency being diminished as having any
validity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Zelikow, a former US career diplomat who taught until
recently at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government,
agrees. He said he is ``struggling to think of a circumstance for
how you could repeat this precedence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a supporter of presidential power,'' said Zelikow, who now
heads the University of Virgina's Miller Center of Public Affairs.
``I just have a different notion of what I want the president to
have the power to do. None of this, so far, is a problem for me.''

   UNDATED - Tragedy on top of tragedy unfolds with this story that
begins three years ago when two blonde, blue-eyed girls born at the
same Virginia hospital were sent home with the wrong mothers.
</P>
<P>
   And so apparently does triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Callie Johnson lost her biological parents, but she still has
her mom. Rebecca Chittum is not an orphan, even though the parents
who have loved her since the day she was born died in a July 4 car
accident. She is blessed with caring and sensible grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   The families are teaching a world audience nosing in on a very
private matter important lessons in love and humility. If we're
going to watch, we ought to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Both toddlers' relatives, blood or not, show the wonderful human
capacity, too rarely seen, to do what's best for the children. At
this early stage of a tragedy when shock and anger often compound
matters, both families appear focused on their precious gifts.
Neither side wants to wipe away either child's identity.
</P>
<P>
   Callie and Rebecca are loved for who they are. Children whose
identities are unquestioned should be so blessed.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody makes mistakes. Most of the worst mistakes hurt
children. Good people try to suffer through mistakes, to right
wrongs as best they can _ to forgive.
</P>
<P>
   The families of Rebecca and Callie are good people. &QL;

 &HT;    Braves-Padres series a probable prelude to October
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ They each have made a mockery of their divisions.
They have arrived at August's doldrums winning almost by rote. Now
the Atlanta Braves and San Diego Padres simply are buying time for
October.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle isn't buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tries to give the same old cliches about this being
just another game,'' Neagle said, ``but it is important to go into
these three games and prove something to ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves and Padres open a three-game series tonight at
Qualcomm Stadium, with Neagle (11-9) facing Joey Hamilton (9-9).
The night begins an 11-day stretch in which the two best teams in
the National League play each other five times. And while these
games are meaningless in some ways, they also can mean plenty, from
home-field advantage through the playoffs to the mind-games that go
on at baseball's highest level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard plenty of guys saying in the locker room that we
need to go out and prove to ourselves that we're ready for
competition,'' Neagle said. ``Because, let's face it _ barring some
freak things, we could be squaring off against these guys, whether
in the divisional series or the NLCS.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' rise this season has been the story of the National
League. San Diego went into Monday night's game against Florida
with 76 wins, matching its season's total from a year ago. San
Diego has picked up nine games on the rest of the NL West just
since the All-Star break. A chance exists that Andy Ashby could win
the Cy Young, Greg Vaughn could win the MVP, closer Trevor Hoffman
could win the Rolaids Award, Bruce Bochy could be manager of the
year and GM Kevin Towers could win executive of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we have a tremendous record (79-39),'' Braves
catcher Javy Lopez said. ``But when I look back, I see the Padres
right behind us (76-41). They're playing great.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves took three of four from San Diego in early May and
have dominated the Padres throughout the decade. Atlanta is 16-5 at
Qualcomm since 1994. But this club is different and has been
waiting for this series to measure itself against Atlanta again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we can beat a team before we play them,''
Neagle said, ``but when I played with Pittsburgh, the Braves were
such a dominant team. It's not that way anymore, or at least I
don't think so. I don't think the San Diego Padres are moaning,
'Oh, Neagle and Maddux or whatever.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They got a pretty good rotation to match up against us.
They've got, in my opinion, the best closer in the game. And
they've got one of the toughest lineups in the NL this year. I've
always said when you come around to August and you play a series
like this, it means a lot. You want to establish in your mind, hey,
look, we want to play some good ball games against this team.''

CONNOLLY HOPED BULGER `NEVER CAUGHT,' AGENT TESTIFIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When former FBI agent John Connolly was interviewed by
a pair of agents who were tracking down fugitive James ``Whitey''
Bulger, his prized informant, Connolly told them he hoped Bulger
was ``never caught,'' one of the agents testified Monday in federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   During that interview, which took place at Connolly's executive
office at Boston Edison in March of 1997, more than two years after
Bulger had disappeared, Connolly told the agents that former
supervisor John Morris &UR;  &LR; had promised Bulger and criminal sidekick
Stephen Flemmi protection from prosecution because they were such
``good informants,'' according to testimony from Agent Walter J.
Steffens Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly also shared an anecdote about how Bulger bought him and
his young buddies ice cream cones at a South Boston soda fountain
when he was a kid, Steffens said. Connolly said he planned to use
the story in the first chapter of the book he hoped to write on his
relationship with the notorious South Boston crime boss.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nothing Connolly said that day was included in an FBI report
filed after the meeting or in a series of reports compiled last
summer after US Justice Department investigators began an inquiry
into the Boston FBI's dealings with its top criminal informants.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until this past June that the full details of that
March 21, 1997 meeting among Connolly and FBI agents Walter J.
Steffens Jr. and Charles Gianturco were written down -- and turned
over to defense attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The lawyers are entitled to see statements that could support
Flemmi's claim that he and Bulger were given immunity from
prosecution in exchange for information they provided the FBI as
informants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are FBI agents trained or instructed to leave out information
that might be helpful to a potential defendant?'' asked US District
Judge Mark L. Wolf, who is considering whether to dismiss charges
against Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, your honor,'' Steffens replied.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi's co-defendants, New England Mafia boss Francis P.
Salemme, Mafia soldier Robert DeLuca, and Winter Hill Gang member
John Martorano are challenging whether the government legally used
several wiretaps and bugs, including one that captured a Mafia
induction ceremony in Medford in 1989. Steffens helped prepare the
affidavit used to get that bug.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by Flemmi's lawyer, Kenneth J. Fishman,
Steffens said he accompanied Gianturco to Connolly's office.
</P>
<P>
   Besides what Steffens called ``the ice cream cone story,''
Connolly ``also told us that he hoped Mr. Bulger was never
caught,'' Steffens testified. Connolly went on to describe a dinner
party that he, Bulger and Flemmi attended at Morris's Lexington
home at which Morris was ``in his cups.
</P>
<P>
   According to Connolly, Morris told Bulger and Flemmi ``that they
were so good (as informants) that he could get them off for
anything short of murder,'' Steffens testified.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who testified earlier in the hearings under a grant of
immunity, denied ever giving Bulger and Flemmi permission to commit
any crime other than murder.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly has refused to testify without immunity but reiterated
in a telephone interview Monday that Bulger and Flemmi were
authorized to continue their loansharking and gambling operations
while working as FBI informants, but nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   In his conversation with Steffens and Gianturco, Connolly said,
``I made it clear to them that (Bulger and Flemmi) were indicted
for things they were guaranteed they would not be indicted for ...
(Bulger) probably felt he was framed by the government ... What
ever happened to keeping your word?''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said his literary agent is sifting through several book
offers.

CENSUS (Undated) - Only the federal government could launch a war

FELICITY (Undated) - She is 22-year-old Keri Russell, star of WB
Network's most touted and envied new sitcom, ``Felicity,'' and she
has created more pre-season publicity buzz than even Calista
Flockhart's ``Ally McBeal'' did last year. What's it like to be the

<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ As rescue teams dug through the deep rubble of
a collapsed building on Monday in a final, desperate search for
victims of the bombing at the American Embassy here, American law
enforcement and intelligence teams began sifting through the
scattered debris, in an equally painstaking search for the tiniest
clue that might provide evidence about the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   Across Haile Selassie Avenue from the embassy and the collapsed
Ufundi House office building, FBI agents, wearing their agency's
logo on hard hats or baseball caps, wielded rakes and shovels on
the first full day of their demanding investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Their task will be frustrated by the need to sift through many
rumors, the difficulties compounded by the fact that many
individuals close enough to the site to have been witnesses
probably died in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   At least 192 people were killed in the explosion, according to
the Kenyan government. At the U.S. Embassy, 12 Americans and 27
Kenyans were killed. Fears that the toll of Kenyan employees might
rise diminished considerably on Monday when the embassy determined
that 9 were still missing; on Sunday it had put the number over 30.
</P>
<P>
   In a solemn military ceremony at Jomo Kenyatta airport on Monday
afternoon, American soldiers in camouflage uniforms loaded 11
flag-draped coffins onto a giant Galaxy cargo plane for the flight
to Frankfurt and eventually to the United States. The 12th American
victim, Jean Dalizu, was married to a Kenyan and will be buried
here.
</P>
<P>
   There were no speeches, no sounds other than the distant murmur
of aircraft as Prudence Bushnell, the American ambassador, paid
tribute to her fallen colleagues with her bandaged hand over heart,
and the soldiers saluted.
</P>
<P>
   Back in downtown Nairobi there was a brief glimmer of hope for a
miracle: that a woman who has become known among rescuers as Rose
might still be alive under the tons of concrete and twisted steel
that was once Ufundi House, adjacent to the embassy. At midday, the
Israeli and Kenyan rescue teams that have been working around the
clock stopped briefly when they thought they heard tapping, but
then they resumed clearing the site.
</P>
<P>
   As the possibility that someone was still alive under the debris
seemed to fade, they moved less gingerly. Thick dust filled the air
as cranes and bulldozers tore away a 20-foot-high mound of rubble.
Workers said they hoped to be finished by late on Monday evening or
early on Tuesday. By late on Monday night, they said they had
virtually given up hope of finding survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of students held a vigil at the site on Monday night,
many of them carrying candles or waving palm leaves or flowers. But
as they marched some chanted: ``Down with the Americans! Down with
the Arabs! Down with the terrorists!'' Their leader said they were
protesting the location of embassies in the center of the city.
</P>
<P>
   While the rescuers' work is almost over, the investigators are
just beginning. On the lawn of the stately headquarters of the
Kenya Railways Corp., across the street from the embassy, FBI
agents raked the grass and combed through it on their hands and
knees looking for anything that could be a clue.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of the awaiting difficulties and frustrations was
present in a conversation with two senior officers of the
Cooperative Bank, just behind the American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men, dressed in a white shirt, tie and sport coat,
said he had heard gunfire and three blasts. The other, wearing a
suit and a gauze mask over his face because of the dust, disagreed
with his colleague. It had been two blasts and no gunfire, he was
certain.
</P>
<P>
   As the men talked, employees were bringing out computer
equipment that had survived even though every window in the
high-rise building had been blown out. On Monday, there was a
momentary panic when shrapnel fell from one of the higher floors,
and there were fears that the building might collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of glass being swept up marked the work in the
low-rise shops in the vicinity of the embassy, as life here
returned to normal. The streets were bustling with pedestrians, and
most shops were open.
</P>
<P>
   But there was an undercurrent of tension and fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about putting glass back in again,'' said Sonny
Wanjigi, general manager of an office equipment company whose shop
windows were blown out.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Njoroge, an employee in the Nairobi water department, was
at the end of a two-block-long line outside the Kenya Commercial
Bank. His face was bandaged, from injuries suffered in the blast.
``I'm scared right now, just standing here,'' he said. ``Anything
can happen.''

   UNDATED - Tragedy on top of tragedy unfolds with this story that
begins three years ago when two blonde, blue-eyed girls born at the
same Virginia hospital were sent home with the wrong mothers.
</P>
<P>
   And so apparently does triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Callie Johnson lost her biological parents, but she still has
her mom. Rebecca Chittum is not an orphan, even though the parents
who have loved her since the day she was born died in a July 4 car
accident. She is blessed with caring and sensible grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   The families are teaching a world audience nosing in on a very
private matter important lessons in love and humility. If we're
going to watch, we ought to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Both toddlers' relatives, blood or not, show the wonderful human
capacity, too rarely seen, to do what's best for the children. At
this early stage of a tragedy when shock and anger often compound
matters, both families appear focused on their precious gifts.
Neither side wants to wipe away either child's identity.
</P>
<P>
   Callie and Rebecca are loved for who they are. Children whose
identities are unquestioned should be so blessed.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody makes mistakes. Most of the worst mistakes hurt
children. Good people try to suffer through mistakes, to right
wrongs as best they can _ to forgive.
</P>
<P>
   The families of Rebecca and Callie are good people. &QL;

JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN MCDOUGAL EMBEZZELMENT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After years of delays and legal wrangling, jury
selection began on Monday in Susan McDougal's embezzlement trial in
Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal, who spent nearly two years in jail for refusing
to answer questions from the Whitewater independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, faces up to seven more years behind bars if
convicted in her latest battle with the law.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Monica, she stands accused of bilking conductor Zubin
Mehta and his wife, Nancy, out of more than $150,000 when Mrs.
McDougal was their personal assistant and bookkeeper from 1989 to
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to start the trial but I'm hurting a little bit
today,'' she told The Associated Press, referring to the back
problems that prompted a federal judge to release her from a
California prison in June and send her to her parents' home in
Camden, Ark., as part of a 90-day home-detention sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal, 43, wore a back brace under her dress at the
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   When she was released, Mrs. McDougal was three and a half months
into a two-year sentence for taking part in a fraudulent scheme to
obtain a $300,000 loan in 1986 that was paid to a company she
created called Master Marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the proceeds went to pay the debts of the Whitewater
Development Co., in which she and her husband, James McDougal, were
partners with President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mrs.
McDougal and her husband were separated in 1984 and divorced in
1990. He died in prison in March of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal's current legal problems have nothing to do with
her defiant role in the Whitewater investigation. Los Angeles
County Superior Court Judge Leslie Light told the dozens of
potential jurors on Monday to disregard ``anything and everything''
they may have heard about Mrs. McDougal from that case.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Monica charges were filed against her five years ago
and ``we have basically been waiting since then,'' said Sandi
Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County District
Attorney's office. ``We did agree to allow her other prosecution
back East to be completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal is facing 12 counts of embezzlement and fraud in a
case that is built around the Mehtas' financial records.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal, who lived in one of the Mehta family's five homes
and traveled throughout the United States and abroad for Mehta's
concerts, is, among other offenses, accused of forging Mrs. Mehta's
name on a credit card application and fraudulently charging more
than $90,000 of personal items, including expensive clothes and
hotel stays.
</P>
<P>
   She is also accused of charging thousands of dollars of personal
air travel and of bilking the couple out of $65,000 in falsely
claimed expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The court has imposed an order that neither side can discuss the
evidence of the case outside the courtroom, but in a previous
interview, Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, said the Mehta
case would have been dropped long ago if the defendant were not a
prominent figure in the Whitewater investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Geragos said Starr's prosecution team had used the California
charges as a ``club'' to force Mrs. McDougal to cooperate, an
accusation Starr's team denies. The local prosecutor, Jeffrey
Semow, has also denied any connection between the two matters.
</P>
<P>
   The delays are not over yet.
</P>
<P>
   After the jury is selected, Ms. Gibbons said, the trial will
take a two-week hiatus so the defense and prosecutors can review
thousands of pages of recently released Internal Revenue Service
documents.

PATRIOTS MANAGEMENT NOT RUSHING TO JUDGMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After the Patriots' second straight exhibition loss,
vice president of business operations Andy Wasynczuk says the team
will not panic and abandon its current crop of running backs and
cornerbacks until there's more evidence that the personnel in place
can't do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still early in the preseason and we can't overreact
right now,'' said Wasynczuk. ``We need to play better, and the
coaching staff and football people are going over things and taking
a look at what's happened the past two games to see if they can
make the proper adjustments to put us on a better course.''
</P>
<P>
   Some would say the Patriots have played Russian roulette with
their roster. They traded cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock because they
thought they had a veteran in Steve Israel to fall back on while
Tebucky Jones was learning the position. But Israel's recovery from
knee surgery is still ongoing and may last into the regular season.
That has led to Plan B: Chris Canty. Oops.
</P>
<P>
   After losing Curtis Martin as a restricted free agent _
declining to match the New York Jets' offer _ they felt second-year
running back Sedrick Shaw or first-round pick Robert Edwards could
do the job. Oops again. Shaw hasn't proven anything, and Edwards
has been injured. While the Patriots were experimenting with the
Shaws (Sedrick and Harold), Edwards, Derrick Cullors, and even free
agent pickup Robert Green, other teams were signing Greg Hill and
Raymont Harris, two runners who might have been able to step in and
play right away.
</P>
<P>
   Now what?
</P>
<P>
   In two exhibition games, the Patriots have averaged 2.8 yards
per carry. Is the problem the backs or the line or both? There are
three games to solve the problem before the Patriots open the
season in Denver Sept. 7. What if Edwards isn't well enough to
play? What if the injuries continue?
</P>
<P>
   What options do the Patriots have?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have conclusive evidence right now to jump into
signing other personnel,'' said Wasynczuk. ``Edwards has been out
with an injury and the two Shaws have only played two games.''
</P>
<P>
   In Green Bay, contract talks with holdout running back Dorsey
Levens haven't gone anywhere. Levens is looking for a significant
raise _ something slightly less than Martin got _ after one
breakthrough season. Could the Patriots get Levens for a No. 1
draft pick next year (they have two of them, thanks to Bill
Parcells)?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, trades are rare in the NFL, and doing something that
drastic would be a sign of panic and perhaps admitting a mistake.
The Patriots are also trying to sign Ted Johnson to a long-term
contract and would have to bump his $403,000 salary this season to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have been cool about the situation, strolling
through minicamp, training camp, and two exhibitions as if what
they have is good enough to compete in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Kirby remains in waiting in Miami. He has drawn interest
from Kansas City, Oakland, San Francisco, and Tampa Bay. The
Patriots have continually told his agent, Mike Battle, ``We'll call
you if we need you.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, after watching the Patriots struggle for the second
consecutive week, Battle phoned Wasynczuk.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Terry's sake, he really can't wait beyond this week,''
said Battle. ``He wants to get with a team right now. He's been
patient and I've asked him to be patient so we can see what
situations develop where he might have the best and biggest role.
He doesn't want to go somewhere and be a third-down back only. He
wants to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy said that he wished he could have said, `No, the Patriots
won't be interested in Terry,' but he said he thought the football
people wanted to give it one more week in Mexico to see if
something could emerge. I don't think we'll wait that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirby, who is Chris Slade's cousin, has never been a No. 1 back.
He's been effective as a third-down back because he's a superb pass
receiver. After the 49ers let Ricky Watters go, he gave them some
threat of a running game, a threat the Patriots do not have this
morning. Kirby played for San Francisco when Pete Carroll was the
defensive coordinator there, and Carroll earlier seemed to lean
toward Kirby as a player who could add something to the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Also out there is former Giant Rodney Hampton. He has been a No.
1 back, but he's an eight-year veteran. He runs straight-ahead, no
nonsense, and has the savvy to pick up extra yardage when there's
seemingly nothing there. The current stable of Patriots backs sees
nothing there and can't make anything happen.
</P>
<P>
   Also available: Herschel Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese, who had Walker in
Dallas, is a big fan, and Walker would definitely add veteran
leadership in what would be his 13th season.
</P>
<P>
   A sorrier state of options is available for defensive backs.
Former Bear and Steeler Donnell Woolford remains a free agent. The
Patriots brought him in for a look this spring. Scooter McGruder is
running a couple of Blockbuster Video stores in the Atlanta area.
Terry Ray is available.
</P>
<P>
   The best option appears to be watching the waiver wire to see if
anyone better than Jones, Canty, Steve Lofton, Kato Serwanga, or
Terry Billups becomes available. Of course, if teams are cutting
veteran cornerbacks, chances are they aren't better than what the
Patriots already have.
</P>
<P>
   While Wasynczuk is correct in pointing out how early it is,
panic has gripped some corners of Patriots Nation.

CONGOLESE GOVERNMENT TROOPS CLAIM FIRST SUCCESS AGAINST REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ Claiming its first major success against
a week-old insurrection, Congolese officials said on Monday that
government troops had succeeded in beating back rebels who had
captured several strategic towns in the southwest of the country,
encircling many of them at a rebel-held military base.
</P>
<P>
   According to the government's account of the fighting, which is
largely supported by Western diplomats, troops loyal to President
Laurent Kabila operating out of the town of Boma have contained the
rebel forces in an area between the coastal towns of Banana and
Kitona, where fighting between both sides continues.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-government forces opened a western front in the war
last Tuesday, when in a surprise maneuver, they flew hundreds of
rebels by commandeered aircraft to Kitona from the far-eastern city
of Goma, one of the first Congolese towns to fall under rebel
control.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila's government has charged that the airlift was
masterminded by neighboring Rwanda, which it says is sponsoring the
uprising. The two countries had previously been close allies, and
Rwandan forces are widely seen as having borne the brunt of the
fighting in a previous rebellion that brought Kabila to power in
May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's loss of Kitona, the site of one of western Congo's
most important military bases, was seen by most military analysts
as a dramatic setback for Kabila's government, after the quick fall
of several major eastern cities at the start of the war.
</P>
<P>
   From its toehold there, many analysts predicted that the rebels
would quickly seize control of the Congo's only sea port, and move
rapidly toward the capital, Kinshasa, to the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kabila's forces do indeed seem as if they are having some
success in the southwest,'' a European diplomat said. ``It is hard
to know exactly what is going on there, but the rebels certainly
don't seem to be advancing.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, residents of Kinshasa said conditions on the main
highway to the sea seemed normal, at least as far as the major port
city of Matadi, which is the railhead for sea traffic and supplies
the capital with most of its imports and many food supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to my sister this morning in Matadi, and she was
leaving by road for Kinshasa today,'' said Roger Kabue, a Congolese
trader reached by telephone. ``People are going about their lives
normally there, it seems.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing heavily on the allegations of Rwandan involvement in the
uprising, Kabila's government has had great success in recruiting
new members into the country's army, and has managed to turn the
conflict, for many Congolese, into a question of national
resistance against foreign domination.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Witnesses in Kinshasa said Monday that for the second
consecutive day a government enlistment drive had signed up at
least 5,000 volunteers for the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila's government has generated strong support by claiming
that the uprising is the work of Congolese of Tutsi descent and of
the Rwandan and Ugandan governments. The Tutsi are a tiny minority
in Congo and are a minority also in Rwanda, but control the
government and armed forces in that country.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda, another former supporter of Kabila and ally of Rwanda,
has denied any involvement in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Western diplomats and international human rights
groups have expressed concern over reports of widespread arrests
and other abuses of Congolese and Rwandan Tutsi in Kinshasa by the
government, as it whips people up for the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot let a bunch of Tutsi take over our country,'' Kabue
said. ``Rwanda is a tiny country compared to the Congo. They should
have known better than to have provoked us.''

   AFRICA-TERRORISM (Nairobi, Kenya) _ Lede-all on the bombings: As
the United States offers a $2 million reward for information about
the U.S. embassy bombings, witnesses tell of a truck that may have
carried the Nairobi bomb. Officials from the CIA and the FBI are
evaluating leads that include a terrorist manifesto delivered in
Cairo and reports of vague warnings that an Islamic terrorist group
might be planning an attack. And CIA officials, convening here in a

explosion. By Tim Weiner. (We plan to move the story by 8:30 p.m.

JOBS, `OUTSOURCING' STICKING POINTS IN PHONE WORKER STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Future jobs and the contracting of non-union workers continued
to be major issues in negotiations Monday between Bell Atlantic
Corp. and 73,000 striking telephone workers.
</P>
<P>
   As talks continued late Monday, the second day of a potentially
crippling walkout, members of the Communications Workers of America
used picket lines to focus attention on union demands for a cap on
subcontracting and greater opportunity for CWA workers to move into
future jobs involving the Internet, cable, multimedia, wireless
communications and other new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Customer service representatives, phone operators, installation
workers and other CWA members walked off their jobs in 13 Eastern
states and Washington, D.C. after the expiration of a three-year
contract at 12:01 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   CWA represents 2,800 customer representatives in New England.
</P>
<P>
   A second union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, is dominant in New England, where it represents some
17,000 technicians, installers and operators. IBEW members honored
the CWA picket lines, although IBEW workers stayed on the job in
places without picketers.
</P>
<P>
   The IBEW is negotiating a separate contract with Bell Atlantic,
but said it expects to have an agreement soon.
</P>
<P>
   There were some signs the strike could be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said they have introduced a proposal that
``meets all the (CWA) demands,'' and seemed hopeful an accord would
be reached at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offer we are currently negotiating addresses all the
union's concerns,'' John Johnson, a Bell Atlantic spokesman in
Boston, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a hotel room in New York, Melissa Morin, president
of CWA Local 1400, which represents 2,800 customer service
representatives in New England, said negotiators had reached an
agreement on overtime, flexible scheduling, and other work-life
issues. But she added: ``We are still looking for guarantees that
our people will have access to future jobs when the company expands
into other fields. And we are still concerned about the outsourcing
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The union notes that even as the Internet and other new
technologies are creating new work, jobs are being shifted to
non-union contractors and non-union subsidiaries. Morin estimated
that at least 50 new subsidiaries have been created by Bell
Atlantic over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   CWA contends that Bell Atlantic has moved the management of
200,000 accounts from New Jersey and Pennsylvania to outside
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic declined to discuss the outsourcing issue Monday,
saying the matter should not go beyond the bargaining table.
Tensions rose last year, however, when the company created Bell
Atlantic Plus, a subsidiary in Norfolk, Va. The nonunion
telemarketing center is staffed by customer service representatives
who earn, on average, $7 per hour and receive no benefits, union
officials said. Unionized customer service representatives
currently earn $21 per hour, with a full benefits package, the
union sources added.
</P>
<P>
   The Bell Atlantic strike is among several job actions in recent
years that have stemmed from labor's attempts to limit employers'
use of subcontractors and outsourcing to boost profits and slash
labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   Such fights are likely to continue as outsourcing spreads among
big US firms. This year alone, more than $140 billion will be spent
on outsourcing services, up from $100 billion in 1996, according to
a report by The Outsourcing Institute in New York. Not surprising,
information technology firms such as Bell Atlantic are the leading
users of outsourcing and represent approximately 30 percent of all
outsourcing expenditures, according to the Outsourcing Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that outsource tend to have ``complex and constantly
changing processes or functions,'' said Frank Casale, executive
director of the institute. ``It would take so much money and
manpower to master all of these functions so why even bother?
That's why companies are outsourcing.''
</P>
<P>
   From General Motors Corp. to Boeing Co., CHK outsourcing has
been a key issue at the bargaining table as companies move to
streamline and unions fight to retain jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, GM and the United Auto Workers fought during a strike
over the company's right to transfer steel wheel assembly to an
outside contractor, a move that eliminated 80 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, nearly 4,000 workers threatened to strike at Ford Motor
Co. on several issues, including the automaker's decision to
subcontract seat-making work to Johnson Controls. And at Boeing
plants around Seattle and Portland, Ore., the issue of job security
and outsourcing has led to labor unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``For labor unions, contracting out or outsourcing will be the
major fight over the next five to 10 years,'' said Thomas Juravich,
a labor expert at the UMass Amherst. ``Companies say it's
inevitable, that this is the way globalization is moving.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bell Atlantic and other phone companies adopt Internet
technology and build sophisticated new networks to handle voice and
data traffic, new jobs ranging from software designers to computer
networking technicians are being created. But union officials fear
their workers will be shut out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call them the jobs of the future,'' CWA spokeswoman Candice
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials also fear that increased competition from new,
nimble rivals may drive Bell Atlantic to farm out many of these
technical jobs to non-union subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Bell Atlantic serves 27 million customers from Maine to
Virginia, providing them with telecommunications, wireless
communications, cable, digital TV, Internet and data services.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which plans to merge with GTE Corp., was formed
from the union of the orginal Bell Atlantic and Nynex, two of the
so-called Baby Bells that were spun off from AT&AMP;T in 1984.

TANZANIAN GUARD ON DUTY AT U.S. EMBASSY WHEN BOMB EXPLODED IS LAID
TO REST 
</HEADLINE>
   (See related AFRICA-BOMBINGS, AFRICA-SURVIVE, AFRICA-DEAD,
AFRICA-TERRORISM, AFRICA-U.S.)  
 (JT)  
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania _ Mtendje Rajabu was laid to rest on
Monday in a deep, sandy grave under a grove of coconut trees, three
days after a terrorist bomb killed her as she stood on duty at the
entrance to the American Embassy in a snappy uniform with red
epaulets on her small shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, the American forensic experts with their bags
of equipment and the Tanzanian radiologists had finally finished
inspecting her body for the smallest hints that might aid in the
hunt for the attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Draped in a bloody and torn sheet, the body of Ms. Rajabu, 31,
who used to have a smile for everyone, was handed over to her
grieving husband, Shaban. He, their two young sons and an extended
family of aunts and uncles and friends had waited long hours for
the body under a hot sun on the mortuary grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd filled two open trucks and several cars and
immediately left to follow the coffin, placed on the back of a
pickup truck and draped in a ceremonial black and gold cloth, for
the ride to Mrs. Rajabu's ancestral village on the capital's
outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   On the way, the procession wound through the bustle of city
streets, stopped to gather neighbors at Mrs. Rajabu's usual bus
stop and then threaded its way through the tracks of Segerea, the
village where generations of her family have been buried.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the others killed in the bomb blast were also
released by the forensic experts on Monday, and, for the most part,
simple but emotional funerals were held. Among the nine who died
were Abdurahman Abdalla, a Kenyan who is married to an American,
Susan Hirsch, and three Tanzanian colleagues of Mrs. Rajabu who had
worked with her as security guards.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the focus was on Mrs. Rajabu, because she seemed
to rejoice in the job of greeting American diplomats and visitors
who passed by her reception desk at the outdoor guardhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a wonderful, big smile,'' said John Lange, the charge
d'affaires at the embassy. ``She was well known and loved around
the embassy.''
</P>
<P>
   Her cousin Rashid Khamis, 31, an air traffic controller,
described her as effervescent and a woman of great warmth. ``I wish
you could see the picture of when she got married,'' he said. ``She
looked like an angel.''
</P>
<P>
   In this impoverished society, working at the American Embassy
was a big deal, no matter how lowly the post. It meant security and
prestige.
</P>
<P>
   But for Mrs. Rajabu, her husband said, it was not enough to be a
guard for a privately run firm, Ultimate Security, which had a
contract with the embassy. On the morning of her death, she left
home with a bigger ambition on her mind: to work directly for the
American government inside the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was to be interviewed that Friday for a job as a telephone
operator,'' Rajabu said. ``She was happy and excited. She spoke
excellent English, and at night she was taking secretarial courses
to improve her skills.
</P>
<P>
   Rajabu said that when he heard the explosion at the embassy last
Friday, he rushed to the morgue, knowing that his wife was in an
exposed position and fearing that she was among the dead. An hour
or so later, he saw her body, still in the uniform she liked so
much, emerge from a van.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew as soon as I saw her,'' he said. ``She had only a cut
on her head. She still had her identity card here,'' he said,
pointing to the left side of his chest. Apparently, she was thrown
to the ground and killed instantly.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Rajabu's coffin arrived at the tin-roofed home of her
parents, several hundred people were waiting under a canopy of
towering mango trees. The women in the crowd greeted her with a
chorus of wails and paid their last respects to her coffin in the
privacy of the house. The men gathered outside on straw mats laid
out on the earth and listened to the Imam from the local mosque
offer prayers. ``We hope she died with a peaceful heart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Large trays of soupy beans, prepared by the women of the
village, were served to the men before they lifted Mrs. Rajabu for
the walk to the freshly dug grave on the edge of the village.
</P>
<P>
   There, according to the Islamic tradition here, Mrs. Rajabu's
body was removed from the coffin and wreathed in a white shroud.
Her body was lowered into the six-foot-deep grave, where her
husband covered her body with layers and layers of grass. Then,
with hands and a few shovels, the men of the village filled the
chamber with sand, leaving two stark wooden boards as markers for
her burial place.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Africa, it is very easy to accept death through sickness,''
said Khamis as he walked away. ``But it is very hard when there is
no reason.''

 &HT;    Braves on deck: San Diego Padres
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ When: Today at 10:05 p.m., Wednesday at 10:35 p.m. and
Thursday at 5:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV: TBS will telecast tonight, Fox Sports South Wednesday and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: Today, LHP Denny Neagle (11-9,
3.73; 4-1, 2.75 lifetime vs. Padres) vs. RHP Joey Hamilton (9-9,
4.70; 1-7, 6.08 lifetime vs. Braves). Wednesday, RHP Greg Maddux
(15-5, 1.53; 18-10, 2.62 lifetime vs. Padres) vs. RHP Andy Ashby
(15-6, 2.55; 3-2, 4.63 lifetime vs. Braves). Thursday, LHP Tom
Glavine (15-4, 2.47; 15-10, 3.75 lifetime vs. Padres) vs. LHP Mark
Langston (4-4, 5.66; 1-0, 0.00 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   _ Series history: Atlanta leads the all-time series 270-213 and
is 64-27 (.703) against the Padres since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   _ Past meetings: The Braves took three of four from San Diego,
May 7-10. Andres Galarraga had three homers during the series,
while Braves pitchers held the Padres to a .227 average.
</P>
<P>
   _ Padres leaders: Avg.: Tony Gwynn (.325); HRs _ Greg Vaughn
(39); RBIs _ Vaughn (93); SBs _ Quilvio Veras (21). Wins _ Andy
Ashby (15); ERA _ Trevor Hoffman (1.67). Saves _ Hoffman (38).
Strikeouts _ Kevin Brown (180).
</P>
<P>
   _ Quickly: The Padres were 57-31 at the All-Star break, when
they held a 5 1/2-game lead on San Francisco. San Diego has since
gone 19-10, entering Monday's game with Florida, and picked up nine
more games on the fading Giants. The Pods have been in first place
since June 10 and, at 76-41, are on pace to win 105 games. The
franchise record for victories is 92, set in the 1984 World Series
season. . . . The frightening thing is that San Diego is doing it
while hitting just .258, 10th in the NL and the lowest by any Padre
team in the last four years. But improved pitching has made a
tremendous difference. After posting an NL-high 4.99 team ERA last
year, the 1998 Padres have cut it down to 3.68 with the additions
of Kevin Brown, Mark Langston, Dan Miceli, Brian Boehringer and
Donne Wall. . . . The Padres entered Monday night 4-1 on their
current 11-game homestand. Before that, they went 3-4 on a road
trip to New York and Montreal. The NL East has been San Diego's
least-favorite division with a 16-11 (.593) record. Against the NL
West and NL Central, the Padres are 54-23 (.701). . . . The Braves
will miss Brown this trip but will have to face Ashby, who was the
first NL pitcher to win 15 this year. He beat Tom Glavine 3-2 on
May 8, allowing nine hits while striking out only one in eight
innings. Ashby is 5-1 in his last seven starts and is 10-2 dating
back to May 30. ... On the DL: LHP Ed Vosberg (shoulder
tendinitis).
</P>
<P>
   _ Who's hot: Although he lost a game in extra innings to
Philadelphia on Thursday, closer Trevor Hoffman's 38 saves lead the
major leagues. He is four saves away from tying his career high,
set in 1996. Center fielder Steve Finley has hit in seven of his
last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   _ Who's not: 3B Ken Caminti had been in a 2-for-21 skid until
hitting a homer Sunday night. OF Greg Vaughn entered Monday's game
in a 7-for-58 slump that has seen his average drop 27 points to
.283. Vaughn has 21 strikeouts in his last 13 games.

 &HT;    Steeler Stewart still transforming from athlete to QB
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LATROBE, Pa. _ The majestic tree just beyond the end zone, once
described by author Roy Blount as ``the camp willow,'' was weeping
here last week under an oppressive sun that forced even veteran
visitors to St. Vincent College to seek shady relief.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 yards upfield, Kordell Stewart was crying crocodile
tears, loudly feigning incredulity as new offensive coordinator Ray
Sherman forced the Pittsburgh Steelers young quarterback to
simulate his drop into the pocket and then verbally identify the
coverage in the secondary. Time after time, and without a football
in his hand, Stewart would fade back and focus in. For 20 minutes,
the lone pupil in a class that could have been titled
``Drop-and-Read 101'' continued the tedious exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the lengthy primer was simple: In 1997, his first
season as the starter and the year in which the former ``Slash''
became more than just an offensive novelty, Stewart proved he could
pass. This season, however, he must pass the next test and
demonstrate to the skeptics that he is more than a wondrously
gifted athlete trying to make himself into an NFL quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``You meet fans when you're out shopping or whatever, and
they'll say, `Oh, you exceeded our expectations last year,' ''
Stewart said, when asked to assess his '97 performance. ``Or
they'll tell you something like, `You're so young; it's only going
to get better.' Don't get me wrong, it's all very heartfelt and I
appreciate the interest. But I expected more from myself last year.
And this year, I expect a ton more. I know everyone is watching.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Stewart, 25, may be fortunate to have Sherman
around to serve as both tutor and confidant.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart is one of five starting quarterbacks of African-American
descent in the NFL, Sherman one of 11 coordinators. Both are record
numbers for the league, but it hardly represents an age of
enlightenment. Sherman aspires to be an NFL head coach and knows
Pittsburgh offers the kind of high-profile position that could
catapult him into consideration. He agrees that his relationship
will be scrutinized.

 &HT;    Louchiey's injury leaves plans on hold
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Corey Louchiey missed his fifth and sixth consecutive
practices with the Atlanta Falcons on Monday, but it's hard to tell
what's more sore _ his groin or the coaching staff that is aching
to evaluate him as a potential starter at right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons gave Louchiey a two-year, $3.5 million contract to
replace Matt Willig, who left for Green Bay. But Louchiey, a
6-foot-8, 315-pound, three-year veteran, suffered a groin injury
near the end of the afternoon scrimmage in Jacksonville on Aug. 1
and hasn't practiced since.
</P>
<P>
   Nate Miller started in Friday's 31-16 preseason loss to
Tennessee, and rookie free agent Jose Portilla backed him up.
Neither player embarrassed himself, but the idea of either making a
first regular-season start on Sept. 6 against Kevin Greene and
Carolina is cause for pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed (Louchiey) out here last week, but you can't do
anything about it,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``As soon as he gets
healthy, he'll be in there because we need to evaluate him.''
</P>
<P>
   Louchiey, 26, rides an exercise bike outside the locker room and
strides around the practice fields. ``If you're hurt, you can't
play,'' he said. ``It's very, very, very frustrating, because I
need all the time I can get.''
</P>
<P>
   And Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler needs all the protection
he can get. Atlanta quarterbacks were sacked 54 times last year,
fifth-most in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corey has to work. He knows that,'' offensive line coach Art
Shell said. ``We need to see him on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller spent most of the 1995 and '96 seasons on the Falcons'
practice squad. He dressed for 12 games last year, playing little
in 11. His size (6-3, 310) and athletic ability are pluses, but his
technique needs work. He was involved in one of the two sacks
Atlanta surrendered Friday, when Oilers end Pratt Lyons got to Tony
Graziani.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pass protection is the thing (Miller) has got to work on,''
Shell said. ``The mental errors are tough on a young guy. His
footwork is fine. He has the athletic ability to play, but pass
protection is like dancing. You have to have good footwork and be
in step with everybody. It's choreographed.''
</P>
<P>
   Louchiey, a third-round draft choice of Buffalo in 1994, started
13 games the past three seasons with the Bills. Atlanta gave him a
$500,000 signing bonus and a base salary this season of $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   If he ends up proving as talented as the Falcons' scouting
report seems to indicate, he'll become a lot richer next year, when
his contract calls for an increase in salary to $1.5 million and a
$1 million bonus to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   NFL teams will start cutting players in two weeks, but Reeves
isn't counting on getting help that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do it probably with what we've got here,'' he said. ``I
don't think there's anything out there that's going to be better
than what we've got.''

<P>
   CHARLESTOWN, Nevis, _ Barely two miles of water separate the
pair of islands that make up this tiny Caribbean nation of St.
Kitts and Nevis. But if the 10,000 or so people who live on the
36-square-mile speck of land called Nevis voted as predicted Monday
in a referendum on secession, the smallest country in the Western
Hemisphere will soon be severed in two.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and leaders of other Caribbean nations may
worry that Nevis is too small to stand on its own. But local
leaders here say they cannot wait to leave behind their status as
junior partners to St. Kitts, to take control of their own destiny
and to become an independent state with its own voice at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in St. Kitts don't know what the problems are over
here,'' said Vance Amory, the premier of Nevis who has led the
drive for secession. ``Nevis is something they have forgotten
about, and we cannot continue to operate on the basis of tokenism.
The days have passed when we can be told to be quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the issue on the ballot in this charming,
cloud-capped island 250 miles southeast of Puerto Rico could not be
simpler and more direct. ``Do you approve of the Nevis secession
bill and Nevis becoming an independent state separate from St.
Kitts?'' voters were asked. Voters in St. Kitts, which has about
36,000 people, were not eligible to take part.
</P>
<P>
   For the proposal to be approved, two-thirds of the ballots cast
must respond in the affirmative. An informal poll conducted by The
St. Kitts-Nevis Observer, a weekly newspaper here, found that more
than 70 percent of potential voters were in favor of secession, and
in a nonbinding ballot conducted back in the 1970s, 80 percent of
the votes cast favored independence.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Denzil Douglas has said he will honor the result
of the vote, whatever it is. ``My government stands ready to assist
with whatever choice you make,'' he said in parliament last week,
so that St. Kitts and Nevis ``can continue to live in harmony and
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas has also made it clear that he regrets that ``the
secessionist genie is out of the bottle'' and predicted
``disastrous consequences'' if the nation splits apart. To take
such a step, he argued, is an act of provincialism that defies the
logic that has led to the creation of the European Union and a
global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of St. Kitts and Nevis have more in common than the
people of Germany and France,'' he argued. ``If it were not for the
water that separates us, there would be no justification for
secession.''
</P>
<P>
   To outsiders, the differences between Kittitians and Nevisians,
as residents of the two islands call themselves, are indeed
virtually imperceptible. But Nevisians have always complained about
being forced into union with St. Kitts, a step that Britain took
during colonial rule more than 100 years ago for administrative
convenience, and they have clung to the notion that they have a
separate identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only two miles of water, but if you travel, you'll find
there's a big difference between the people,'' said Bernard Brooks,
43, who works as a taxi driver in the U.S. Virgin Islands but came
home to vote for secession and take part in summer carnival.
``Nevis people are more gentle, more polite.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   St. Kitts and Nevis became independent of Britain in 1983, with
a constitution that established the country's capital in
Basseterre, on St. Kitts, and created a parliament that reserved
eight seats for St. Kitts and three for Nevis. The charter also
included a provision allowing Nevis to secede unilaterally, and
after much debate, the Nevis Island Assembly last year unanimously
approved a vote on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Since independence, both islands have depended heavily on
tourism and respective offshore financial sectors. But even on
those points there are disagreements, with people in Nevis
complaining that St. Kitts is trying to strangle the Nevis economy
with offshore legislation and that too much of the revenues that
Nevis generates from upscale tourism remain on the other island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevis is for high net worth individuals,'' attracting
Hollywood celebrities and English royalty, explained Mark Brantley,
an Oxford-educated Nevis lawyer who has been one of the leaders of
the independence drive. In contrast, he maintained, St. Kitts
attracts ``low-scale package tours, the secretary who saves up all
year for a week in the sun,'' but has the more modern airport.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is being watched with some anxiety by members of the
Caribbean Community, or Caricom, a regional trade and political
grouping of 16 small and predominantly English-speaking nations.
Several of those nations are also multi-island states whose smaller
components have been known to chafe at their status, among them
Trinidad and Tobago, Antigua and Barbuda and St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, and there are fears that secession fever could spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a source of great concern to us if there is to be a
fragmentation of St. Kitts and Nevis and a creation of yet another
micro-mini-state in our region when all the implications and
dangers that it entails come at a time when we are to integrate and
not disintegrate,'' Edwin Carrington, secretary-general of the
group, said last week. He called the vote here the region's most
serious challenge since the American invasion of Grenada in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, evidently alarmed at the prospect of the
emergence of a ministate that might be vulnerable to the pressures
or blandishments of drug cartels, has echoed those worries.
``Maintaining the federation would be more compatible with the
trend toward greater regional integration, with all its
considerable benefits and advantages,'' State Department spokesman
James Rubin said recently.
</P>
<P>
   But premier Amory rejected any suggestion that Nevis will be
worse off on its own. ``Size is not an indication of viability,''
he said in an interview. ``There are some large countries in Africa
that are not viable states,'' while several small island states,
among them Singapore, Nauru, and Tonga, are flourishing.
</P>
<P>
   Because of ``technology and the way institutions are
established,'' he added, ``that idea of a critical mass can no
longer be used as a criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who favor remaining in a federation with St. Kitts stress
practical issues, none of which have been negotiated in advance of
the vote. Fishermen wonder whether they will be barred from St.
Kitts' waters, storeowners fear that tariffs may be imposed on
goods moving from one island to the other, and others wonder where
the money will come from to pay for public services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're in a sufficient state of preparedness,''
said Trevor Chapman, owner of a grocery store here. ``There hasn't
been enough education, and there are still too many unanswered
questions, the primary of which is what will be the source of our
income? It's not going to be no bed of roses.''

POISON IS SUSPECTED OF SICKENING 10 IN JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Ten people in Niigata, a port city on the western coast
of the largest island in the Japanese archipelago, were
hospitalized on Monday morning after drinking tea and coffee made
with hot water that appeared to have been poisoned, police
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the incident could have been a copycat crime
inspired by a poisoning on July 25 in Wakayama, southwest of Tokyo.
In the Wakayama case, four people died and dozens more were ill
after eating curry containing arsenic and possibly cyanide that was
served at a local festival.
</P>
<P>
   Although initial tests of the Niigata victims' vomit showed
traces of cyanide, the police said that further tests had found no
trace of cyanide in the victims' bodily fluids or in the tea or the
water used to make it.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were among 13 workers at the Niigata branch of
Xyence, a company that makes preserved lumber used in construction.
The victims had made themselves tea or coffee after taking part in
morning exercises. Immediately after sipping their drinks, many of
them detected a strange taste and spit the beverages out, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   They were taken to three local hospitals shortly after 8 a.m.
with symptoms that included fainting, impaired vision, vomiting,
and numbness in the hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshiaki Sugai, a division director at Xyence, said that the
Niigata plant used two preservatives in its manufacturing
processes. One, Tanalith CuAz, is in its original state classified
as a deadly poison in Japan. When diluted in water, as it is in
Xyence's manufacturing process, the preservative is not designated
a poison, Sugai said. ``We are cautious in storage and handling,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Wakayama, the police suspect that a community feud may have
led to the poisoning. The victims were two community leaders, as
well as a 10-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary tests in that case pointed to cyanide poisoning
because cyanide was found in the blood of one of the men who died
and in various samples of vomit.
</P>
<P>
   But later tests, conducted at the National Research Institute of
Police Science, found traces of arsenic in all three pots in which
the curry was served. The institute found no evidence of cyanide,
which could have evaporated before more extensive tests were run,
and the police now suspect that the deaths were caused by arsenic
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenic is commonly used in pesticides and for the extermination
of rodents, even though its use in Japan is prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still puzzling over how the poison got into
the curry. About 10 percent of the local police force in Wakayama,
or 217 officers, is working on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Poisoning is not uncommon in Japan, where the ownership of guns
is strictly limited. Adding poison to food is a favorite tactic of
extortionists and those seeking revenge.

MANY HMOS `PROFIT EXCESSIVELY' FROM MEDICARE, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Health maintenance organizations have been
receiving more than $1 billion a year in overpayments from the
Medicare trust fund because their administrative costs are ``highly
inflated,'' federal investigators said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare is paying a disproportionate share of HMOs'
administrative costs'' _ much more than its ``fair share'' _ and
the government should try to recover the excess payments, the
inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services
said in a new report.
</P>
<P>
   The report came at a delicate time for the managed care
industry, which is being encouraged by Congress to play an
increasing role in serving the nation's 38 million Medicare
beneficiaries. Spokesmen for many HMOs have complained in recent
months that the federal government did not pay them enough to care
for Medicare patients, but this and other studies suggest that in
some cases they have been paid too much.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general, June Gibbs Brown, said that many HMOs
``profit excessively'' from Medicare, because they bill the
government for administrative costs attributable to their private
commercial customers as well as their Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   In short, she said, HMOs have received ``an unreasonable
amount'' from Medicare because their administrative costs were
grossly and artificially inflated, by a total of $3 billion to $4
billion in the three years of financial reports that she reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the Health Care
Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, responded that her
agency was making changes to reduce overpayments in the future. But
in a written response to the inspector general, Ms. DeParle
disagreed with the recommendation that she seek legislation
allowing Medicare to recover the excess payments. In effect, she
said, the overpayments help HMOs finance extra benefits for
Medicare patients, and this is apparently what Congress intended.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the chairman of the
Special Committee on Aging, urged the administration to try to
recover the overpayments. ``Can't we get back that money for the
trust fund?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, the national trade group for managed care companies, said:
``HMOs have not done anything wrong. We have followed the rules.
The Medicare payments to HMOs were all reviewed and approved by the
Health Care Financing Administration.''
</P>
<P>
   HMOs say that if the government cuts their payments for
administrative and other costs, it will be more difficult for them
to offer extra benefits, like eye care and prescription drug
coverage, which have attracted elderly people in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, the inspector general, said the overpayments were
cause for concern because of the precarious financial condition of
the Medicare program, which finances health care for more than 38
million people, including 6 million in HMOs. Under current law,
with no action by Congress, the Medicare trust fund is expected to
run out of money in 2008, three years before the first baby boomers
reach the age of 65.
</P>
<P>
   Administrative costs include marketing, taxes and profits,
salaries and fringe benefits for certain executives, rent,
depreciation, interest expenses, data processing, legal fees and
other overhead costs associated with the management and operation
of an HMO.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs get a fixed monthly payment, set in advance, for each
Medicare patient. The payments are based mainly on data that HMOs
submit to the government. Ms. Brown said many HMOs were ``aware
that the amounts that they submit for administration are inaccurate
and result in unjustified expenditures of Medicare funds.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Examining the financial records of HMOs with Medicare contracts
in 1996, Ms. Brown found that Medicare paid 31.7 percent of their
administrative expenses, but accounted for only 8.9 percent of
their enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   For 1994, 1995 and 1996, Ms. Brown said, ``the presently used
methodology allowed HMOs to overestimate their anticipated needs
for administrative costs by as much as $1 billion, $1.3 billion and
$1.9 billion, respectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare payments to HMOs have grown significantly, to $25.6
billion last year from $8.6 billion in 1993. The Congressional
Budget Office predicts that 10 million beneficiaries, or 25 percent
of the Medicare population, will be in HMOs by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is encouraging the trend, in the belief that HMOs can
help control costs in the long run. But some HMOs have pulled out
of the program, saying that Medicare payment rates are inadequate.
United Healthcare Corp., one of the nation's biggest HMOs, took a
$900 million charge against earnings last week, in part to abandon
unprofitable Medicare plans.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeParle, the Medicare administrator, agreed that the
accounting techniques used by HMOs had ``almost certainly resulted
in overstated administrative costs.'' But she expressed concern
about possible cutbacks in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received reports that some HMOs have reduced benefit
levels and increased premiums'' for Medicare patients this year,
she said, and ``it is possible that beneficiaries will again
experience reduced benefit levels'' in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Medicare has operated on the principle that it should
pay its share of costs for various services.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown found that the administrative costs assigned to
Medicare were more than three times the amounts that HMOs charged
to commercial customers, even though ``a large portion of
administrative costs are fixed'' and do not vary with a patient's
age. In 1997, she said, the average monthly HMO premium for
administrative costs was $20.87 for commercial customers and $77.30
for Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   For one HMO, Ms. Brown said, the disparity was ``even more
egregious.'' On its financial statements, she said, this health
plan reported $287 million in administrative expenses, but Medicare
payments for administration totaled $366 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievably,'' Ms. Brown said, ``the Medicare program covered
127 percent of the plan's administrative expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   If Medicare payments to an HMO exceed the cost of the standard
package of benefits, the health plan can use the money to provide
extra benefits like prescription drugs, eye examinations, dental
care and foot care.
</P>
<P>
   But the inspector general said there was some evidence that HMOs
had not provided all the extra benefits they indicated in their
annual reports to the government. And that, she said, is one reason
Medicare officials should try to recover the ``excess payments'' to
HMOs.

 &HT;    Dumias' diving is 'freaky and scary' of late
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Troy Dumais had no time for reflections on the 1996
Olympics as he trained at the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't see beyond reflections on the surface of the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not able to see the water,'' America's top male junior
diver said, bewildered at his prospects for the 1998 National
Diving Championships. ''It's one smack after another.''
</P>
<P>
   On about 20 practice dives from the 10-meter platform (about 33
feet), Dumais landed mostly on his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I see the water, I stretch for it, and I guess I get a
reflection of something,'' he said. ''No matter what I do, I'm
going short.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumais is the first to admit, ''All that is excuses.'' He knows
he has to adjust. After all, conditions were the same at the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I'm having a hard time,'' Dumais said. ''It's just some
people don't understand how freaky and scary it is when you're
supposed to land straight up and down and you don't see the
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumais, 19, of Ventura, Calif., has one more day to get his
bearings: Nationals begin today, but he won't begin competition
until Wednesday on the 10-meter platform. He'll also compete in the
1- and 3-meter springboard events. His brother Justin is competing
in synchronized diving, which makes its Atlanta debut in a major
event.

   Dumais, who won three junior national titles last week in Largo,
Fla., is one of 13 divers who won crowns at spring nationals,

UNITED HEALTHCARE DROPS PLAN TO ACQUIRE HUMANA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Minn.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a much anticipated parting, United Healthcare Corp.'s
$5.5-billion acquisition of a rival health-care giant, Humana Inc.,
collapsed over the weekend after the value of United Healthcare
stock fell $2.9 billion late last week.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup, announced early on Monday, was no surprise. On
Thursday, United Healthcare reported an unexpected $900 million
charge in its second quarter, causing its stock to plunge 28
percent to $37.875.
</P>
<P>
   After the selloff, Humana's shareholders would have only
received $3.1 billion from the acquisition, far less than the $5.5
billion the company had agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   But Humana had other reasons to walk away from the deal.
Analysts said Monday that company executives were worried that
United Healthcare's charge could be just the beginning of other
financial troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies also appeared to have differing views on the
Medicare market. While part of United Healthcare's $900 million
charge was to scale back its Medicare offerings in some areas,
Humana was one of the industry's most prosperous competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We disengaged because United Healthcare identified some
problems with its operations,'' said Greg Donaldson, a spokesman
for Humana, which is based in Louisville, Ky. ``That made it clear
that Humana would be more successful on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   While analysts said that Humana and United Healthcare, of
Minneapolis, would both prosper independently, the collapse of the
deal left investors and analysts wondering about what might have
been.
</P>
<P>
   A combined Humana and United Healthcare would have been the
United States' largest health-maintenance organization. With 10
million members, the combined company would have dominated the
South Florida and Chicago markets as well as those in several other
Midwestern cities.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, Humana and United Healthcare would have had
a significant advantage in controlling costs. When the acquisition
was announced in May, Dr. William McGuire, the chairman of United
Healthcare, predicted the deal would bring eventual savings of $100
million to $250 million, largely by eliminating administrative
costs and lowering payments to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has also been the thought in health care that bigger is
better,'' said Arun Kumar, a director at Standard &AMP; Poor's. ``But
this is not always true. Several of the smaller players are
performing well. One can hope that now this deal is over, Humana
and United Healthcare will get back to blocking and tackling,
concentrating on the fundamentals of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed disappointed that the deal had collapsed.
United Healthcare's shares took another beating Monday, ending
trading at $33.375, a new 52-week closing low. Since Wednesday
afternoon, United Healthcare stock has plunged 36.8 percent. Humana
closed on Monday at $17.9375, down 37.5 cents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   United Healthcare's aborted acquisition of Humana may not be the
last of its troubles, analysts said. Several health-maintenance
organizations have struggled in the last year _ notably Oxford
Health Plans, which has posted heavy losses _ leaving many
investors skittish about health-care stocks. Humana's walking away
from the deal has made investors only more suspicious of United
Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humana's executives may have wondered if the charge was just
the tip of the iceberg,'' said Linda Varoli, an analyst with Merger
Insight. ``They may have believed there were other charges to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   United Healthcare executives declined to comment beyond the
company's announcement on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Even though subscribers should not notice any change in service
or coverage as a result of the deal's cancellation, Humana and
United Healthcare could face different short-term futures.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect Humana to concentrate on its operations, while
keeping an eye out for smaller acquisitions in several of the
company's key regions.
</P>
<P>
   United Healthcare now has a double mission. Not only must it
avoid any further financial surprises, but it has to squeeze more
profit from Medicare services.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said on Monday that United Healthcare might not have
been able to sign up enough Medicare patients in several of its
rural areas to enable it to negotiate discounts with hospitals and
other medical providers, a common problem among managed-care
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What companies have to do is cut back on the benefits,'' said
Kenneth Abramowitz, a health-care analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein
&AMP; Co. ``The industry is offering $1,000 in benefits, when they can
only afford to provide $750.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said on Monday that the demise of the Humana
acquisition by United Healthcare should have little effect on other
deals. Because today's stock mergers are strategic, they are more
likely to be renegotiated than scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   In July, for example, two oil-service companies, Baker Hughes
Inc. and Western Atlas Inc., renegotiated the exchange ratio when a
slump in oil-service stocks dragged down the value of Baker Hughes
shares.
</P>
<P>
   And then again, a canceled deal may not be a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal between Humana and United Healthcare breaking up may
be a blessing in disguise,'' Abramowitz said. ``Now they can
concentrate on their operations and how to perfect managed care and
eventually disease management. You know, for HMOs to work, they
eventually have to prove they can upgrade the quality of care.''

COMMENTARY: FORGIVE AND FORGET  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of the U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa, the
White House kept putting out the same sound bite on every network:
An unnamed senior official was quoted as saying: ``We will not
forgive and we will not forget.'' That is a noble sentiment. There
is only one problem. If you look at the Clinton administration's
foreign policy over the past two years there has been a consistent
pattern of forgiving and forgetting.
</P>
<P>
   Where should we start? How about Iraq? In March, after Saddam
Hussein threw out the U.N. inspectors and the United States
threatened force, the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan, worked
out a new arrangement for weapons inspections in Iraq. The
Clintonites insisted that this new deal be codified in U.N.
Security Council Resolution 1154, dated March 2, 1998. That U.N.
resolution stated that Iraq had to provide ``immediate,
unconditional and unrestricted access'' to U.N. inspectors, and
``any violation would have the severest consequences for Iraq.''
Well, last week the Iraqis informed the United Nations that they
were totally ``suspending cooperation'' with the U.N. inspectors.
What was the U.S. response? It sure wasn't the severest
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton officials said that all the Iraqis were doing was
shooting themselves in the foot: by not complying with the U.N.
inspections it meant the U.N. economic sanctions on Iraq would
never be lifted. But this assumes that Saddam's priority is to get
the sanctions lifted. What if his real priority is to get rid of
the U.N. inspectors so he can keep his remaining weapons of mass
destruction? Clinton officials will tell you that finding a
solution for Saddam is hard, especially with America's feckless
allies. I agree. But then someone should explain how doing nothing
advances our interests.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with the
Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat in London, presented them with a carefully
balanced U.S. peace plan and told them each they had until the next
week to say yes. If they did, the president himself would oversee
the opening of final-status talks between them. If they said no,
reporters were told, the United States made clear publicly its plan
and who was blocking it. Arafat said yes, Netanyahu said no. Ms.
Albright has barely been heard from on this issue since. Is Arafat
not living up to his yes? Is Netanyahu being obstinate? Is the U.S.
peace plan still operative? Aw, just forget it.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic began squeezing
ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo. Albright made some very tough
statements about how this new Serbian aggression would not be
tolerated. Well, I don't know how many thousands of Albanians have
been driven from Kosovo by Milosevic since those threats were made,
and ignored, with few consequences. Is Kosovo a difficult problem?
Yes. So then explain why the policy has changed. But don't ask us
to forgive and forget in August what was just said in June.
</P>
<P>
   For two years now the Clinton team has been saying that it could
expand NATO without any negative impact on Russia's ratification of
the Start 2 Treaty _ which would slash Russia's and America's
nuclear arsenals, a vital U.S. interest. But month after month goes
by and the Russian Parliament still refuses to ratify Start 2.
What's going on? Forgive and forget.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as though the administration has learned the wrong
lesson from its fiasco at Ohio State. Officials tried to explain
Iraq on CNN, it didn't work, and now it appears that they don't
want to explain anything _ especially with their best explainer,
President Clinton, drowning himself out with his own Marine Band.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Albright has all the right rhetoric for a secretary of
state with an activist president behind her. But activist rhetoric
without an activist president looks like empty bluster. We end up
with all the disadvantages of being the world's richest and most
powerful nation _ everyone makes you a target _ without any of the
advantages, like feeling as though we are shaping world events our
way. It seems in recent months as though we have gone from a
one-superpower world to a no-superpower world, and that is
something no one should forget or forgive.

GRATEFUL FOR THE GIFT OF GRATITUDE

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The message was recorded at 8:22 a.m. Tuesday, Aug. 4.
The caller, a woman, spoke for 30 seconds. I know the time and date
and duration from the fancy telephone answering system at the
newspaper. What I don't know, exactly, is why I haven't deleted the
message.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else from that day is gone, listened to and then
erased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Montini,'' she says, ``my name is Debbie. I'm, I'm dying
of liver cancer and I just I wanted to tell you thank you very much
for your articles. Now that I have so little time, I'm thanking all
the people that have done something special for me in my life. .
.''
</P>
<P>
   She's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I never did anything special for this woman. The newspaper
articles she thanks me for writing weren't done for her. They were
done for me, like I every article I do. Including this one.
</P>
<P>
   I figure on some level Debbie knows this, or at least senses it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she thanked me. And I haven't erased her call.
</P>
<P>
   Voice mail is like a dripping faucet. If the bucket underneath
isn't periodically emptied _ to water the garden or fill the pet
bowls or wash the car _ it spills over and is wasted.
</P>
<P>
   It's not economical to leave a little something at the bottom of
the container.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there it is, all these days later, the soft voice of a woman
speaking to an answering machine early one Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She talks calmly and evenly, hesitating only once and only for
an instant. She asks for nothing and doesn't leave a number. She's
not expecting a return call.
</P>
<P>
   On one of her last days she wasted 30 precious seconds, maybe a
couple of minutes when you add in the time it took to collect her
thoughts, get the telephone number, dial and so on.
</P>
<P>
   It's too much time to spend on a stranger who hasn't done a
thing for you, except by accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you so much,'' she says at the end, ``and I wish you a
lot of luck, fortune and happiness. Bye.''
</P>
<P>
   That's it.
</P>
<P>
   I've listened to Debbie's message more than a dozen times. In
all the 30 seconds of her monologue, she does not once mention the
potential importance of a stain on the dress of a former White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The dress was extremely important to several callers before her
and after her. But not to Debbie.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't bring up El Nino, either, or the race to break Roger
Maris' home run record.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie doesn't discuss Geraldo Rivera's feud with Tom Brokaw,
the primary elections scheduled for next month, the movie
``Titanic,'' the fall television schedule, the list of the 100 best
books of the century or Jerry Seinfeld's HBO special.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't mention her First Amendment right to free speech,
her Second Amendment right to bear arms, her unalienable right to
life or liberty and the pursuit of happiness, or any other rights.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does she complain about a single wrong. I've had many
messages since Aug. 4 from people who believe they've been wronged.
None of them is dealing with anything close to liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
   What about all the violence in the movies and all the sex on TV?
Or all the violence in the streets and all the sex in the White
House?
</P>
<P>
   These are things we KNOW are important. They're in all the
papers. They're on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie didn't even hint at them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she made time at the end of her life to thank a guy she
doesn't know for doing a job he gets paid to do.
</P>
<P>
   I hate to contradict a person in her situation, but Debbie
doesn't know what she's talking about. She's got it completely
backwards. It was she who did something special for me.
</P>
<P>
   She gave me a gift.
</P>
<P>
   I was going to save it for myself, but it's something that has
value only if it's used. That's why, if you've read this far,
there's only one thing left for me to say to you:
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    World Series, playoff ticket prices increase
 &HT;    (EDS: To clarify that Major League Baseball has doubled ticket
prices, and prices will vary from city to city. Prices listed below
are for Atlanta.)
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Braves season-ticket holders will get a
surprise in the mail this week, when the invoices for postseason
games arrive. Prices for World Series games have doubled to $150
per game for most seats.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the National League Championship Series games have
been increased by $10, although tickets for the Division Series
essentially will stay the same as last season.
</P>
<P>
   The prices for the National League Championship Series and World
Series were set by major league baseball during an executive
council meeting in June. The council is made up of team owners and
commissioner Bud Selig.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the cost of tickets in other sports for their
championship events,'' Selig said Monday, ``our people felt that
the framework was there, that these were rational and fair prices.
There were people on the committee who were concerned, including
yours truly. But when we compared baseball to other sports,
everybody finally became very comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt fans would get upset at the increase, Selig
said, ``No. It's the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Braves didn't make the Series last year, they
printed tickets _ $75 for box seats (dugout/suites, club, field and
terrace, field pavilion and terrace pavilion) and $50 for
upper-deck seats. This year, box seats will cost $150 and
upper-deck seats $100.
</P>
<P>
   The Series dates this year for the National League teams are
Oct. 20, 21 and 22.
</P>
<P>
   All box seats for the league championship, which were $50 last
year, are now $60, while upper-deck reserve, which were $35 last
year, are $45.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the division series are $30 for dugout/suites, $25
for club, $20 for field and terrace, $15 for field and terrace
pavilion and $10 for upper reserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time there is an increase in prices, be it regular season
and post, we hear from some fans,'' Braves senior vice president
Bob Wolfe said.

JAILED (Scottsdale, Ariz.) - Perhaps they don't see the large signs
warning travelers against carting guns and ammunition into Mexico.
Maybe they think they can get away with it. Or perhaps they don't
care. Whatever their reaons, 29 Americans now are being held in
jails in Sonora state for violating Mexico's strict firearms laws.
The latest, a Scottsdale father, has been in a Nogales, Sonora,

<P>
   BUXTON, N.C. _ When children dream their candy-cane dreams of
spiral-striped lighthouses standing sentry above a sinister sea,
the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse is the one they imagine.
</P>
<P>
   At 208 feet, it is the tallest and most majestic of an estimated
850 lighthouses in the United States. Although it serves little
navigational purpose for today's electronically equipped mariners,
its flashing beacon _ a pair of 1,000-watt lamps that rotate every
15 seconds _ can still be detected for 24 nautical miles on a
starry night.
</P>
<P>
   No one appreciates the sentimental tug of the lighthouse more
than the residents of North Carolina's Outer Banks. Just as their
seafaring ancestors depended on the beacon to guide them through
the treacherous shallows of Diamond Shoals, so today's Outer
Bankers rely on the light to lure the tourists that fill their crab
shacks and clapboard motels.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is understandable that this area is uneasy about a
daring plan by the National Park Service to protect the 2,800-ton
lighthouse from the encroaching sea by lifting it in one piece with
hydraulic jacks and moving it slowly on dollies along a track into
the brush 2,900 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, the $9.8 million needed to move the lighthouse, a
project to begin as soon as next spring, is the subject of a battle
between two conservative North Carolina Republican lawmakers who
rarely disagree.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Sen. Lauch Faircloth secured approval from the
Appropriations Committee for the financing, which had been
recommended by President Clinton. But in the House, Rep. Walter B.
Jones Jr., who represents the Outer Banks, has responded to
overwhelming sentiment on the barrier islands against the move.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has kept money for the move out of the House bill, but he
also failed to win financing for a less-expensive plan to build a
jetty that would temporarily protect the lighthouse where it is.
The difference between the bills leaves the fate of the lighthouse
to a House-Senate conference committee that is expected to meet in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Buxton, where the historic beacon attracts 250,000
visitors a year, locals worry that the lighthouse will crumble if
it is moved, leaving their tourist trade in a heap of a million
bricks. To emphasize the meaning of the sentinel to their
community, they relate childhood memories of drifting to sleep to
the soothing blink of the lamp through their bedroom windows.
Middle-aged men reminisce about romancing tourist girls from atop
the lighthouse, where the corkscrew ascent of 248 steps is rewarded
with a pelican's view of the seascape below.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the lighthouse survives a move, islanders like Daniel
Couch, a Buxton service-station owner and co-chairman of the Dare
County Lighthouse Committee, argue that its integrity will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men who kept this light were required to stay in the
lighthouse in hurricanes, in nor'easters, in all conditions,''
Couch said. ``Now, 100 years later, we're going to turn tail and
run?''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, churning currents and violent storms erode the
Hatteras Island shoreline by an average of 10 feet. When the
lighthouse was built in 1870, it stood 1,500 feet from the sea.
Today, fewer than 120 feet of sand and dunes separate the
lighthouse from the waves. Without action, scientists believe,
seawater will soon invade the freshwater pocket that protects the
yellow pine timbers beneath the granite base, exposing the
foundation to dry rot and worms.
</P>
<P>
   Few here question that the lighthouse should be saved, although
some contend that it would be more dignified for it to be taken by
the sea than by an engineer's miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the image of the lighthouse is one that tugs on
everyone's heartstrings,'' said Jan DeBlieu, an Outer Banks writer
whose book ``Wind'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1998) discusses the impact
of climate on the islands. ``But it's like everything else that's
built along this coast. It's ultimately doomed to fall in.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the plan to move the lighthouse 1,600 feet from the sea is
considered a temporary fix. Officials with the National Park
Service, which owns the lighthouse as part of the Cape Hatteras
National Seashore, predict that it will preserve the building for
100 years, an estimate that critics call optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative plan, which calls for a steel jetty, or groin,
that would extend 500 feet into the ocean, would save the
lighthouse for 15 to 30 years, experts say. But the alternative
proposal, with an estimated cost of $5 million to $6 million, has
run afoul of a state regulation that prohibits the construction of
seawalls, jetties and other beach-hardening structures.
</P>
<P>
   On the Outer Banks, where ocean currents run north to south,
such structures may build up sand deposits temporarily on the north
side of a groin. But they also eat away coastline on the south side
and ultimately cause erosion of the entire beach, environmental
advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state can grant exemptions to its coastal
protection rules, it has done so only in rare instances where there
is no clear alternative for protecting historic sites or bridges.
The state has shown no interest in granting an exemption in this
case.
</P>
<P>
   Like other environmentalists, Todd L. Miller, the executive
director of the North Carolina Coastal Federation, contends that an
exemption will undermine North Carolina's Coastal Area Management
Act, a national model. Miller said it would soon encourage people
up and down the coast to seek exemptions to protect their houses
and vital roads. Two studies, one by the National Academy of
Sciences in 1988 and one by a faculty committee at North Carolina
State University in 1997, concluded that moving the lighthouse was
the best option for saving it.
</P>
<P>
   The company selected to engineer the move, International Chimney
Corp. of Williamsville, N.Y., has moved three lighthouses in the
last five years, but none compare in height or weight to the tower
at Cape Hatteras. The largest, the Block Island Lighthouse in Rhode
Island, is less than a third as tall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, International Chimney and the National Park Service
express complete confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Such reassurances do little to assuage the fears of tourists
like Jesse L. Davis Jr., a 45-year-old engineer from Cary, Ill.,
who has been visiting the lighthouse for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll crumble,'' Davis predicted while visiting on a brilliant
day. ``You know, man is very arrogant and he thinks he can do
anything. And sometimes he just gets slapped in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, then added: ``Boy, it would break my heart not to be
able to bring my daughter back here and climb to the top.''

BEANIE BABIES, BASEBALL'S FUZZIEST SAVIOURS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif, Colo., Ill., N.Y., Texas)  (js) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Ken Griffey Jr., Kerry Wood and
Juan Gonzalez. Baseball's real stars this season, the ones almost
guaranteed to pack the house, are Peanut, Glory, Stretch,
Valentino, Derby, Chip and Tuffy.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the Beanie Babies, baseball's fuzziest saviors.
</P>
<P>
   Beanie Babies have nothing to do with baseball and are not
fashioned to a team's desires. The Cardinals' request for a Beanie
Baby made to look like Fred Bird, their mascot, was denied, but
Rocket the Blue Jay seems tailor-made for Toronto.In any event,
promotional giveaways of the plush toy animals have been unlike
anything team officials have seen since the Chicago Cubs persuaded
the Beanie Babies' creator, Ty Inc., of Oak Brook, Ill., to plunge
into sports last year.
</P>
<P>
   The goggle-eyed prospect of snagging a free Beanie (and the
numbered card of authenticity that comes with it) has led some fans
to camp out overnight for tickets, an effort notably absent in the
pursuit of traditional promotional handouts like bats, balls,
T-shirts, caps, gloves, posters or schedule magnets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had to hire extra security to hand out magnets,''
said David Alioto, the senior director of sales and marketing for
the Oakland As.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1, the As drew 48,241 spectators _ about 33,000 more
than their average _ when they bestowed Peanut the blue elephant to
15,000 youngsters 14 or under.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beanie Babies are our all-time best promotion,'' said Gail
Ruhling, of the Cardinals' corporate sales department. The team's
first promotion this season, featuring Stretch the Ostrich, yielded
a near-sellout on May 22; giving away 20,000 Smoochy the Frogs this
Friday is expected to fill Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   At last month's All-Star Game at Coors Field in Denver,
Colorado, all 52,000 fans received Glory, a red, white and blue
bear. ``I expected kids to clamor for it, but it was fun to watch
grown men with their Beanie Babies,'' said Mark Gorris, major
league baseball's vice president of team services. ``And you'd be
surprised how many players have their own collections.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have held two Beanie Baby days this season. The
first, a Valentino the Bear giveaway, coincided with David Wells'
perfect game on May 17, and drew 49,820. The second, on Sunday,
honored Stretch the Ostrich, and drew 55,911. In both cases, 23,000
fans 14-and-under received the toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``In May, I could definitely say the Beanie Baby impacted
attendance,'' said Debbie Tymon, the Yankees' director of
marketing. ``But in all fairness, I think we would have had the
same crowd on Sunday without the Beanie Babies. They probably were
a little icing on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' Curly the Bear promotion will take place on Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has become a beneficiary of the Beanie Baby phenomenon.
The 150 separate, whimsically named beanbag animals sell in
specialty stores for $5 to $7, and are amassed in the hundreds, or
thousands, by children. Ty periodically ceases production of some
characters, a scarcity-enforcing tactic that has made some
``retiree'' Beanies worth up to $5,200 to the most rabid
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   At the stadiums, teams have been wary about collectors trying to
induce the kids getting the giveaway toys to sell them on the spot.
Some have hired security or local police to maintain calm. At the
Oakland giveaway, Alioto said, an airplane towed a sign imploring:
``Call Me For Your Beanie Babies.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Ty had no connection to the sports market when John McDonough,
the Cubs' vice president of marketing, brought them a detailed
promotional plan. He had been inspired by his daughter Colleen, a
devoted Beanie Baby collector.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was helping her put her Beanie Babies in a basket,''
McDonough said, ``and I said, `Which one is this?' And she said,
`Cubbie.' '' The connection was immediate, and McDonough tracked
down Ty, a company that does not have a listed phone number because
of the huge volume of phone calls from customers.
</P>
<P>
   McDonough and Ty plotted two dates last season which, when
announced to fans, ``immediately sold out,'' he said. ``There were
lines three blocks long.'' Quickly, other baseball teams called him
to find out how to reach Ty.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Cubs sold out Wrigley Field with a Daisy the Cow
giveaway (in memory of the late announcer Harry Caray), and in
September, first baseman Mark Grace will be feted when 10,000
Gracie the Swans will be given to 10,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipated the success of Beanie Babies in stadiums with
children, and we knew ticket sales would be higher for games when
they were given away,'' said Lori Tomnitz, a publicist for Ty.
``But it's become a phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   About 25 of the 30 major league teams have joined the Beanie
world, said Tomnitz. Five of the 10 Women's National Basketball
Association teams have held Beanie giveaways this season; the
National Hockey League's Chicago Blackhawks, St. Louis Blues, and
Pittsburgh Penguins will distribute the toys next season, as will
the Chicago Bears (which recently put Beanie Babies in their fan
club kit) and the Dallas Cowboys in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears that the Beanies are smart business: for at least
one or two games a year, a team is guaranteed to draw thousands of
young fans it might not otherwise attract. Of course, some team
officials report that a small segment of Beanie recipients leave
without even attending the game. ``We can't control that,'' said
Ruhling, of the Cardinals. ``It's still paid attendance.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the cost of giving away anywhere from 10,000 to
52,000 Beanie Babies is negligible to the teams, who find sponsors
to pick up the tab. Generally, mass quantities of Beanie Babies
cost $2.50 to $3 each for sponsors like Haagen-Dazs and Chase
Manhattan, the backers of the Yankees' giveaways, or Pepsico and
Tribune Corp., who are paying for the Cubs' promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Beanie Babies' popularity, which has grown
exponentially since 1993, the Yankees' Tymon said that finding
sponsors was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept saying, `These are huge, you won't believe the impact
they'll have,' '' she said. ``But it was a hard sell. It's not a
cap, or a schedule, and the Beanies weren't customized, with the
sponsor logo.''
</P>
<P>
   That problem seems to have been eliminated. The promotions'
success is obvious and the cards that accompany the toys bear the
sponsors' names. ``Now companies are calling me to see if teams
need sponsors,'' said Tomnitz.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Brenner, editor of Team Marketing Report, an industry
newsletter, added, ``It's a one-of-a-kind item with a perceived
value. The whole idea is to get people excited about going to the
ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   That notion may be anathema to fans who believe the
game-is-the-thing, but the Beanie Babies are proving to be as
valuable as a stack of McGwire's bats. So precious is the plush
Beanie cargo that cartons full of them demand special security upon
their secret delivery to each stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to schedule exactly to the minute when the product
arrives, and the time when people meet us,'' said Tomnitz.
``Usually it's 24-hour security, especially if they are retired
Beanie Babies.''
</P>
<P>
   As in baseball, the Beanie Baby Hall of Famers get special
treatment.

MICROSOFT SEEKS TO PARE BACK OR END ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. asked a federal court Monday to narrow or toss
out the government's suit against the company _ the latest effort
to derail the landmark antitrust case before the trial begins next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's request for summary judgment, legal experts say, can
be seen as a routine step in a major antitrust case _ a request to
dismiss the suit that the judge is unlikely to grant, they note.
But the company's 88-page motion, they add, does indicate how much
confidence the Microsoft legal team has gained from a federal
appeals court ruling in June in an earlier, narrower case.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling on the earlier case, the appeals court said that
Microsoft could assert that its Internet browser program for
navigating the World Wide Web was an integral part of its
industry-standard Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   In the current case, which is scheduled to go to trial on Sept.
8, the Justice Department and 20 states contend that Microsoft's
Windows and its Internet Explorer browser are two separate products
and that Microsoft has used the market power derived from its
operating-system monopoly to curb competition in the browser
market.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to have the case pared back, William Neukom, Microsoft's
senior vice president for law and corporate affairs, said, ``We
believe that central elements of the government's claims have been
refuted by the factual record and the recent appeals court decision
upholding Microsoft's decision to develop operating systems that
work well with the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wants the suit dismissed entirely, but, Neukom said,
``at a minimum, we hope the court will expedite resolution of this
case by dismissing many of the key claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Though helped by the appeals court ruling, Microsoft is unlikely
to get the case dismissed, antitrust experts say. To grant the
motion for summary judgment, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson must
find that the facts in the case are essentially not in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department and the states argue forcefully that
many facts remain in dispute. They note that unlike the appeals
court ruling, the outcome of a trial in the current case will hinge
on findings of fact.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the evidence gathered in a lengthy investigation, the
Justice Department and the states believe they can prove that
Microsoft violated antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident we can show that Microsoft's Windows
operating system and the browser were two separate products and
they were tied together for the purpose of destroying its
competition with a range of predatory tactics,'' said Stephen
Houck, chief of the antitrust bureau of the New York state attorney
general's office. ``What this trial will do is set forth the
factual context in which those practices were implemented.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Along with its request for summary judgment, Microsoft filed a
33-page motion Monday in response to the government's request that
the court issue a temporary order requiring Microsoft to offer
personal-computer makers the option of licensing Windows without
its Internet Explorer browser. Together the filings represent the
company's most detailed attack on the antitrust suit it faces.
</P>
<P>
   Among a series of points, Microsoft asserts that it had planned
to incorporate a ``Web-browsing functionality'' in its operating
system as early as April 1994, a few days after the founding of
Netscape Communications, the pioneer and leader in the browser
market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also says the government's claim that in June 1995 the
company tried to get Netscape to enter into an illegal agreement to
divvy up the browser market is merely ``an effort to tar Microsoft
based on an erroneous account of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft points to the 70 million users of Netscape's
browser as proof that Microsoft has not ``foreclosed Netscape from
distributing its Web-browsing software to consumers in vast
quantities.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department said in a statement that Microsoft's
assertions ``can't be squared with the company's own documents,
much less with the large body of evidence that the government will
introduce at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting evidence represented by Microsoft's internal
memos already in the public record, antitrust experts say, suggests
why it is unlikely that Jackson will grant Microsoft's motion for
summary judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The e-mail provides ammunition for both sides, which is what
you'd expect in any big corporation,'' said Robert Litan, a former
senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division, who
is now at the Brookings Institution, a research organization. ``All
that Justice and the states need to show is that a few facts are in
dispute _ and there is a pretty good argument that there are.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  ``Terrorism and force hang like a sword of Damocles over the
whole complex of companies and enterprises that are involved in
transporting oil,'' Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze warned
at a summit meeting of regional leaders in June.
</P>
<P>
   When night falls, the television sets of Central Asia and the
Caucasus are aglow with a different sort of warning: stern
religious broadcasts from neighboring Iran, or news reports of
political upheaval in distant Indonesia and Nigeria, documenting
the cultural backlash and violent instability that so often
accompany an oil boom.
</P>
<P>
   The dangers are directly proportionate to the promised wealth.
And in the Caspian basin, that promise is announced in a gaudy,
ostentatious display of wild spending.
</P>
<P>
   The bonanza has filled the streets of Baku and Ashkhabad, the
capitals of Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, with Cadillacs and
Mercedes. They double-park outside of five-star international
hotels, luxury apartment towers, casinos and nightclubs that have
cropped up virtually overnight _ serving instant local millionaires
and weekending oil roughnecks who drink themselves into oblivion on
$20 shots of Scotch.
</P>
<P>
   The most cautious projections set the region's energy wealth at
200 million barrels worth of oil and natural gas, an amount
exceeded only by the reserves of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The wells drilled by Chevron's joint venture with Kazakhstan,
east of the Caspian in the Tengiz oil fields, ``are capable of
producing 800,000 barrels of crude per day,'' says Connor. ``That's
a major country's worth of oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe the Caspian basin may hold up to 200
billion barrels of oil alone, with 100 billion barrels' worth of
gas under the Kara Kum Desert and other sites.
</P>
<P>
   At average price levels for the 1990s, that adds up to a
treasure chest of roughly $5 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   It will soon be worth far more, as oil prices are certain to
mount. Demand from newly industrializing nations, led by China, is
soaring. Overall, according to the International Energy Agency,
worldwide daily consumption is set to rise from the equivalent of
100 million barrels of oil today, to more than 150 million barrels
in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   All but a handful of the globe's current oil-producing giants
will have emptied their proven reserves during the next two
decades. The United States is expected to run out of domestic oil
in 10 years, Indonesia and Canada in nine years, Nigeria and Russia
in 20.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Azerbaijan's proven reserves alone should last into
the 22nd century. Even Saudi Arabia, with its 262 billion barrels
of untapped oil, will empty its reserves by the year 2080 at
present production levels.
</P>
<P>
   If oil prices reach the $55 per barrel registered in 1982, the
Caspian bonanza will reshape global finance. Yet the new El Dorado
is taking root in sparsely settled infant nations _ among them, the
three primary oil producers have fewer than 28 million citizens,
and none existed as an independent state in 1990 _ without clear,
internationally recognized property rights to the oil fields that
lie off their coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Already, say economists, their financial dependence on oil and
gas revenues is worryingly excessive, despite razor-thin legal
claims to the gushing offshore wells. Almost half of Turkmenistan's
entire GDP in 1996 came from energy exports; more than 30 percent
of the Azerbaijan public budget is paid for by oil.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and gas are ``my future, all of our future,'' says Shalva
Kochladze, regional executive for a European insurance firm. It is
a future gambled on huge amounts of borrowed cash, pumped blindly
into a legal void. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A lawless limbo between the Soviet past and a glittering but
perilous future is the rule across the Caspian basin.
</P>
<P>
   Its most basic element, an inescapable part of daily life for
natives and foreign oil workers alike, is a corruption so
entrenched that it is taken utterly for granted.
</P>
<P>
   The shakedown _ which unfolded more than two dozen times on a
recent 500-mile journey from the Western Pipeline Route's Caspian
terminal in Baku to the Georgian port of Supsa on the Black Sea _
is relentlessly predictable.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of an empty highway, policemen signal the car over
to the shoulder of the road, waving billy clubs and hand-held stop
signs. A brief conversation with the driver ensues. Then, usually
in open sight, the policemen are paid an on-the-spot ``fee'' for
unspecified infractions.
</P>
<P>
   At the Georgian-Azerbaijani frontier, travelers confront a
gantlet of customs officers, ``fixers,'' and sheer con men from
both countries with their hands out.
</P>
<P>
   Even with press credentials and business visas, it took four
hours to cross the two-mile-wide border, following payment of
``special taxes'' negotiated by three cab drivers who each ferried
passengers over a few hundred yards of the customs zone.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers _ and the border officials who work with them _
enjoy a virtual monopoly on traffic between the two nations that
are expected to guarantee the delivery of Caspian oil to the West.
There are no flights between Baku and Tbilisi, the Georgian
capital. Buses are supposed to cross the border three times per
week, but are often canceled without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, according to a confidential World Bank report
obtained by The Chronicle, almost every major public institution,
from local criminal courts to the post office, is fed on a chronic
diet of bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials, the report found, are the greediest, expecting
$300 for their services. The average daily take for the traffic
policemen who haunt the road to Supsa is $20, just ahead of public
health officers, the phone company and housing authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't name a country where corruption doesn't exist,''
said Oktay Hagverdiyev, Azerbaijan's deputy minister of economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of scale _ here it tends to be modest amounts
spread in a very large circle, rather than the large amounts in a
very few hands that you see in countries like Kuwait or the United
States. In either case, the effects are demoralizing.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he says, ``is that policemen, for instance, are
paid around $50 month. You can't live on that today. So bribery,
from an economic point of view, is entirely understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has been preoccupied with an austerity program
imposed after the collapse of the Soviet Union sent currency values
spinning. Azerbaijan has won high marks from international
financial analysts for its campaign against inflation, which fell
from an annual 1,600 percent in 1994 _ when average salaries
plummeted to $8 per month _ to 3.7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do about corruption,'' says Hagverdiyev,
``is improve the public salary structure gradually. To move too
quickly would inevitably create new distortions in the economy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aydin Veliyev pauses for a moment when asked whom he works for.
``That's not a simple question,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As quality control engineer at the construction site of the
Zestafoni Pressure Reducing Station, a critical junction on the
Western Pipeline Project halfway between the Caspian and the Black
seas, Veliyev answers to a byzantine hierarchy of bosses.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian shipping and construction giant, Kvaerner Ltd., is
the station's principal owner, but the land belongs to the Georgian
government, and the 500-mile-long pipeline itself is managed by a
consortium of local firms and multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Although Veliyev himself is an Azeri, the 58 men wielding
shovels in a trench where the pipeline will run are a mixed team
from across the Caucasus, and the chief on-site engineer is a
Briton. They are not paid directly by Kvaerner, but by Turkish and
Azeri contractors, or by one of two Georgian subcontractors that
built a nearby camp where the workers sleep and eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tough job,'' Veliyev says, gesturing toward the
trench, where his men dig furiously under a canopy of storm clouds.
``To meet the schedule, we've been working 10 hours per day since
December, with just four days off per month.''
</P>
<P>
   The Western Pipeline's complex web of partnerships reflects a
conscious strategy, pioneered by the government of Azerbaijani
President Heydar Aliyev and borrowed by Kazakhstan, Georgia and
Turkmenistan. Its cornerstone is an international division of
shares _ and responsibilities _ among as many players as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy makes oil executives nervous. ``The more partners
you have, especially from different countries, the more difficult
it can be at every level,'' says Jim Hawkins, finance and
administration manager for Chevron's operations in Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   But informed observers also call Aliyev's approach a stroke of
genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands that oil is about politics, as well as
commerce,'' said Gurban Aliyev (no relation), an Azeri geologist
who serves as a consultant on the Caspian offshore fields for
Western firms.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, he points out, ``is our biggest and most powerful
neighbor, and governed us for 70 years. It begs for trouble if they
aren't allowed to participate in major production contracts. The
government has seen to it that Iran acquires shares for the same
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy's showcase is the Azerbaijan International
Operating Company (AIOC). Unlike many joint ventures in the
developing world, where state-majority ownership discourages
foreign investors, SOCAR holds a modest 10 percent of AIOC's
shares.
</P>
<P>
   The rest have been parceled out among 11 other oil firms: BP of
Great Britain is the largest shareholder, with 17.13 percent of
AIOC stock; America's AMOCO, however, is just a shade behind with
17.01 percent. The remaining shares are divided among other firms
from the United States, Britain, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Norway and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a deftly structured union joining longtime
international rivals, and what amounts to de facto local control of
costly exploration and drilling operations _ $8 billion has already
been invested in just three of the AIOC offshore fields _ that are
largely paid for by foreign interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the interests of many countries are represented, they all
have a stake in success,'' said SOCAR's Ali Jafarli, a principal
architect of the joint-production strategy.

CONFLICT-RIDDEN CASPIAN BASIN IS WORLD'S NEXT PERSIAN GULF 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK VIVIANO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    BAKU, Azerbaijan _ Rising abruptly from the 140-degree sands of
Turkmenistan's Kara Kum Desert, on the desolate frontiers of Iran
and Afghanistan, a slender pipe twists through a coil of valves and
arrows off toward the setting sun.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the lifeline of the 21st century _ the conduit that will
deliver an immense trove of natural gas and oil to the homes,
factories and transportation systems of America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the industrialized world will depend on it, and on
a group of small, fledgling nations that most Americans have never
heard of.
</P>
<P>
   Veering through Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, the lifeline exits
Central Asia at the Caspian Sea. Swollen with the pulse of offshore
oil rigs, it drives westward across a fragmented map _ Azerbaijan
and Georgia, Dagestan, Chechnya and Abkhazia, the shattered remains
of the Soviet Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   There are two branches of the lifeline now, coursing along two
narrow valleys separated by the 16,000-foot peaks of the Caucasus
Mountains: a pipe that curves northwest across Russia toward the
port of Novorossiysk, and a railroad from Baku to the west coast of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, there will be a third branch, the 500-mile-long
Western Pipeline through Azerbaijan and Georgia, transporting
nearly a million barrels of oil per day to a fleet of tankers on
the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The $600-million conduit will already be obsolete the day it
opens, overwhelmed by an output expected to grow by a dozen times
in the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the Caspian basin's untapped energy resources range
up to 300 billion barrels of oil or its equivalent in natural gas _
50 percent more than the combined total of all proven reserves in
Western Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The region's wells will shower unimaginable wealth on people
whose annual per capita GDP today hovers between $400 and $600,
building a new El Dorado in nations where camels still outnumber
automobiles in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran oil executives, a terse breed who are wary of
superlatives, can barely contain themselves when discussing the
Caspian strike. The first of hundreds of new offshore fields to
begin pumping, a joint venture between Azerbaijan and 11 foreign
energy firms, ``is already yielding a spectacular 60,000 barrels of
crude per day from just five wells,'' marvelled geologist John
Connor, project manager in Baku for San Francisco-based Chevron
Overseas Petroleum, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven years from now, their production level could be a
million barrels per day. That's truly exceptional _ the highest
level of production ever achieved from one field.''
</P>
<P>
   With many of the world's current principal oil sources drying
up, the Caspian reserves are vital to the continuing prosperity of
the West, and the advancement of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every major international oil and construction firm
has sought a foothold in the new El Dorado, led by California
giants such as Chevron, Unocal and Bechtel. In an investment frenzy
that now exceeds $120 billion in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan alone,
they have constructed forests of offshore rigs and derricks at
breakneck speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combined annual capacity of the Western Route and an
expanded Russian pipeline is 550 million barrels of oil,'' said Ali
Jafarli, a top executive at SOCAR, the State Oil Company of
Azerbaijan. ``By 2005, we could be looking at an annual production
of up to 7 billion barrels.''
</P>
<P>
   The next century's energy lifeline, say many experts, flows with
the largest fossil fuel strike in history after the Persian Gulf.
The purest in quality. The most lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are measured in a dizzying, contradictory mosaic of
images. They dramatize the perils and promise of the boom:
</P>
<P>
   At a roadblock just north of the Western Pipeline's Black Sea
terminal, Russian infantrymen in full combat gear, backed up by
tanks, guard the approaches to the only road bridge over the Inguri
River. ``It's possible to cross with the right papers,'' one of
them says. ``But not many people try.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 12, five of his fellow soldiers died on the far side of
the bridge, when a remote-controlled mine destroyed their armored
personnel carrier. The mines were buried in the separatist Georgian
province of Abkhazia, amid the ruins of a six-year-old civil war
between ethnic Georgians and ethnic Abkhazians.
</P>
<P>
   But the war's fluctuations appear increasingly related to a
fierce struggle between Russia and its former Soviet dominions over
the route of the Main Export Pipeline (MEP) _ the proposed new
system that will carry the bulk of Caspian basin oil to market,
paying a fortune to the countries it traverses in transport fees.

 &HT;    Martinez passes Marichal _ at last
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox NewS Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ He could see the brass coming down the aisle Sunday
night, as the Braves flew south from San Francisco. Dennis Martinez
looked up to see John Schuerholz and Bobby Cox coming toward him
and before the pitcher knew where this was headed, he general
manager was in the midst of a toast at 30,000 feet in front of all
the Braves, a final testimonial on Martinez's night of achievement.
</P>
<P>
   There might have been times earlier this year that the sight of
Schuerholz and Cox coming for him might have alarmed the
43-year-old pitcher. But not this time. Martinez had finally passed
Juan Marichal with a 244th career victory. This flight could have
lasted all night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hasn't been easy,'' Martinez said Monday, ''but I guess
everything comes in its time. Yesterday just happened and I never
expected it to happen in the place where the man used to play a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's day was filed with more calls than he cared to
accept, congratulations coming from around baseball and throughout
the Caribbean. Marichal, who has had some sharp words for
Martinez's coming back from retirement, did not phone. But that's
not to say he won't.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be nice to hear from him,'' Martinez said. ''I would
do it sometime along the line when someone else steps in and does
the same thing. I have a lot of respect for him. He's a Hall of
Famer. He was an outstanding pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Marichal didn't call from his native Domincan Republic,
it seemed everybody else did.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been crazy,'' Martinez said. ''People from everywhere,
people from Nicaragua, writers, friends, family members. Even
though we tried to keep hotel from letting all the calls come
through, they were reaching us through the pager.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been 68 days since his last win, 18 appearances over
which time he went 0-2 with a blown save. His ERA, which has never
dropped below 4,00 since the first two weeks of the season, has
been 7.10 since the All-Star break. But if his cause seemed
forgotten in some quarters, it remained a national cause in
Nicaragua, where the celebrations continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish he had gone somewhere else and won the game but I'm
happy for him. I'm not going to lie,'' said San Francisco's Marvin
Benard, the only other Nicaraguan in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you look at the size of our country and the amount of
players we have get to the big leagues, he was the first one and
he's still here. When the call him El Presidente, it's not for
nothing. If he ran for president of Nicaragua, he'd probably win.
He's an inspiration for our country.''

SCANDAL HASN'T HURT CLINTON'S FUND-RAISING ABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ Salacious allegations, subpoenas and talk of
impeachment have done little to diminish President Clinton's star
quality on the campaign trail, where Democrats are counting on his
help to propel them to victory in November.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to embark Monday morning on a three-day
fund-raising trip that will bring him to San Francisco for a $1,000
per plate luncheon with Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis, the
Democratic candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he returns to Washington on Wednesday, he will have
attended five money-raising events in four states and collected
several million for Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton continues to be a very big draw and very
strong asset to the Democratic Party,'' said Olivia Morgan, a
spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The next seven days will be pivotal for the president and
Democrats: Clinton is preparing to give testimony to a grand jury
next Monday, and the FBI will probably complete tests on a dress
that may contain physical evidence of a relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Although the president
continues to enjoy a high public approval rating, Republicans say
that Democrats campaign with Clinton at their own peril.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``If the American people are ever confronted with the reality
that their commander in chief, the leader of the free world, is
lying to them . . . that will take a very heavy toll, not only on
(Clinton's) presidency, but on those who stand with him,'' said
Steve Merksamer, a Sacramento attorney and informal adviser to the
Republican candidate for governor, Dan Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   California Democrats have so far shown no fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope he's out here so often that he'll be going door to
door for our candidates,'' said Bob Mulholland, a consultant to the
state Democratic Party. ``California loves Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Befitting a president who has visited California more than any
president before him, Clinton has already committed a considerable
amount of time to the state's two highest profile contests and he
has plans to spend even more. After attending four money-raising
events for Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer's re-election bid, he is
scheduled for three fund-raisers and two public appearances with
Davis in the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited the president is coming,'' said Michael
Bustamante, a spokesman for the Davis campaign. Bustamante said the
campaign never considered scaling back its appearances with the
president because of the recent controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is extraordinarily popular because he is talking
about issues that California and America care about _ education,
assault weapons, a woman's right to choose,'' Bustamante said.
</P>
<P>
   California Republicans hope they will be able to capitalize on
the president's recent troubles, though few are as willing to go as
far as party consultant Dan Schnur, who suggested that 500 young
Republicans show up at the Clinton-Davis events carrying blue
dresses on hangers as a vivid reminder of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Although they do it in less creative ways, other GOP operatives
do not need to be pushed to raise the issue of Clinton's character.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contrast between Dan Lungren and mainstream conservative
values, and the liberal values of Gray Davis and Bill Clinton is
one that I welcome,'' said Lungren spokesman Dave Puglia. ``I do
think character matters when we choose candidates for high
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for Republican Senate candidate Matt
Fong, said it is ``premature to speculate whether (the scandal)
will be an issue in November,'' but insisted that Boxer's failure
to distance herself from Clinton, in light of her vocal criticism
of others accused of sexual harassment, ``is a testament to how
partisan she is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of California believe he has done a good job as
president,'' said Boxer spokesman Roy Behr. ``And Sen. Boxer has
supported those same policies that have helped turn around the
states fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the president raised more than $1 million at the
first in a series of fund-raisers that is expected to raise $18
million for the party by November.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, he will attend fund-raisers in Kentucky and Chicago
before he continues on to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans concede that Clinton is a prolific money-raiser.
However, on election day, they say the ethical and moral questions
regarding Clinton will likely send loyal Republicans to the polls
and keep disenchanted Democrats at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's presence in California will further energize the
Republican base, and off-year elections are won and lost based on
turnout,'' said Todd Harris, a spokeswoman for the National
Republican Congressional Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans point to the 1974 mid-term election _ just after
President Gerald Ford pardoned former President Richard Nixon _
when Jerry Brown defeated Republican Houston Flournoy by just
176,000 votes out of more than 6 million cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Watergate, Republicans didn't lose votes because people
switched parties, but because they stayed home,'' said Schnur. ``A
lot of Democratic women may not switch sides in November, but may
not be particularly motivated to vote when their president is in
the middle of sex scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, the race for Senate and governor are close enough
that even a modest swing of votes could easily effect the outcome.
The same goes nationally, where the difference between GOP and
Democratic control of the House is at its narrowest margin in 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans took some satisfaction in the victory last week of a
candidate who exploited the president's troubles. In a Republican
primary for a Tennessee congressional seat, Walt Massey distributed
flyers featuring a picture of Clinton and the White House below big
red letters that read: SCANDAL.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the brochure detailed the ``scandal a day
administration,'' touching on matters ranging from Whitewater to
Lewinsky. Massey emerged as the victor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most analysts believe that turnout in this election is going
to be very low'' said Harris. ``To the extent that Bill Clinton
energizes the Republican base, it's very good news for us.''

THE INVESTIGATION: TRUCK MAY PROVIDE CLUE TO IDENTITY OF
TERRORISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: AFRICA-BOMBINGS, AFRICA-U.S., AFRICA-FUNERAL,

(JT) 
 By TIM WEINER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ As the United States offered a $2 million
reward for information about the American embassy bombings,
eyewitnesses told investigators that they had seen a truck that may
have carried the bomb, possibly providing clues to the identity of
the terrorists who carried out the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the CIA and the FBI were also evaluating other
preliminary leads. They included a terrorist manifesto delivered in
Cairo that praised Osama bin Laden, a Saudi financier whom American
officials have identified as a possible suspect, and reports that
intelligence organizations had received vague warnings that an
Islamic terrorist group might be planning an attack in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   The work of CIA officials took on a personal as well as
professional intensity as they mourned the death of one of their
own, an intelligence officer killed in the Nairobi explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in Washington that
the reward would be paid for information leading to the arrest of
those responsible. The bombings killed more than 200 people and
wounded nearly 5,000 others in Nairo and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials here and in Dar es Salaam continued a grisly
search for evidence, meticulously combing through the rubble near
the ruined embassies and examining bodies in a hospital morgue for
pieces of metal.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA and the FBI investigators _ two teams of 60 FBI agents
each in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam and CIA officers from around the
world _ want to reconstruct the events leading up to the bombings.
To help pinpoint the identities of the bombers, they are
interviewing eyewitnesses like a Kenyan guard who told
investigators that he refused to allow a truck through the rear
gate of the embassy. The guard said that a man jumped out of the
truck and opened fire on him, possibly with a hand grenade. Other
Kenyan witnesses provided similar accounts, including a Kenyan
driver who said he saw a man leap from the back of a yellow pick up
truck and throw something toward the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI team is larger than the one sent to investigate the 1996
bombing at the Air Force apartment complex in Saudi Arabia. FBI
officials are trying to determine what kind of explosive was used
in the attack, which will help focus their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Israel army radio said investigators suspect Semtex was used. If
the bomb was made of Semtex, a plastic explosive, it could lead the
investigators toward a network of known terrorist groups. In the
1970s and 1980s, Czechoslovakia sold 100 tons of Semtex to Libya,
according to the Czech president, Vaclav Havel. If the bomb was
made of a commercially available explosive, like dynamite or
ammonium phosphate, the investigation may have to branch out in
other directions.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators must check ports of entry by land, air and sea
on Kenya's porous borders. They must search commercial records like
bills of lading for suspicious shipments. The movements, intentions
and capabilities of known terrorists must be reviewed. The task
could take years, American officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Among the facts the investigators had in hand Monday were a few
tantalizing leads.
</P>
<P>
   Tanzanian police said that they had detained ``several''
suspects, but Susan Rice, the assistant secretary of state for
African affairs, cautioned that the detentions were part of a
routine roundup and should not be taken too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   A foreign diplomat here said in an interview Monday that a
foreign intelligence service reported indications months ago that
an Islamic terrorist organization with bases in Afghanistan and
Pakistan might be planning an attack in Kenya. An American official
confirmed that U.S. intelligence agencies were aware of that
report.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were told to take care for flights coming from Pakistan,''
the foreign diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   But, like most such warnings, the information obtained by the
foreign intelligence service was indefinite _ too fuzzy for any
effective countermeasures. The embassy here never went on alert, an
American official said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official of a foreign intelligence service also
confirmed Monday night that his service had received the reports of
a possible terrorist attack in Nairobi. But he and other
intelligence officials said such reports come in constantly, and
are often understood only in hindsight. ``Intelligence pours in all
the time,'' he said. ``You can't cry wolf every time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The investigators were also analyzing the statement was a
statement issued by a previously unknown Islamic group claiming
responsibility for the attack. American and foreign intelligence
officials said that they were still evaluating whether the
terrorist manifesto, from a previously unknown Islamic group, was
credible, and they cautioned that claims of responsibility were
easily made and difficult to verify.
</P>
<P>
   In the communique, the group said it would ``pursue U.S. forces
and strike at U.S. interests everywhere'' unless revolutionary
changes were made in American foreign, economic and military policy
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The statement included several signs pointing toward bin Laden,
who has financed and otherwise supported previous terrorist attacks
on American outposts, according to U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   The communique, issued to a French news organization and made
public in Cairo Monday morning, said the group was inspired by the
statements of bin Laden. Four Saudis beheaded for bombing an
American installation in Riyadh, killing five Americans, in
November 1995 said in televised confessions that they, too, were
inspired by bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The statement demanded the withdrawal of American forces in
Saudi Arabia and an end to U.S. support for Israel. It called for
an end to American economic sanctions against Islamic republics and
the release of imprisoned Islamic militants - ``first and foremost
Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman,'' the blind cleric convicted and
imprisoned for his role in a plot to bomb the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has voiced similar demands in the past. He not only
sheltered Sheik Rahman but also harbored Ramzi Yousef, the
convicted mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center,
in homes bin Laden owned in Peshawar, Pakistan, near the Afghan
border.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also said ``a man from Egypt who belongs to the
Abdallah Azzam battalion.'' carried out Friday's attack on the
American Embassy in Tanzania, which came almost simultaneously with
the bombing here. Abdallah Azzam, who died in 1989, was a
Palestinian who fought alongside the CIA-supported Afghan rebels
battling Soviet invaders in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was bin Laden's partner'' in extremist politics, a U.S.
government official said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, in 1989, bin Laden, whose family made a fortune
building mosques, royal palaces and government offices for the
Saudi royal family, began to pursue a grand vision: ``a
multinational organization for jihad, to purge the world of Western
corrupters and their Arab friends,'' the American official said.
Jihad is the Arabic word for holy war.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was ``a huge alliance of like-minded groups,'' the
official said. Today bin Laden, by funneling tens of millions of
dollars a year through Islamic charities and banks, supports or
sustains terrorist organizations and extremist political movements
in Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Sudan and Yemen, among other nations,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the men, the money and the violent potential of these
organizations are being scrutinized by hundreds of American
intelligence and law-enforcement officers here and around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA revived its station here Monday, led by officers from
the agency's headquarters outside Washington. American intelligence
officers in Germany who track developments in Iran, Iraq and
Afghanistan, where the United States has no embassies, are also
investigating. The Israeli government has offered the United States
the help of its intelligence agencies in tracking down the
attackers, whom Israeli officials believe were almost certainly
Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI officials include a Rapid Start unit of FBI computer
analysts who inventory and collate evidence. Their presence
suggests that the FBI hopes to play a substantial role in the
forensic examination of the bomb scene and may expect to
participate in any prosecution.

 CHICAGO BOYS, 7 and 8, CHARGED WITH MURDERING 11-YEAR-OLD GIRL   By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In a case that has sent chills across this city, two
boys, ages 7 and 8, have been charged with murdering an 11-year-old
girl, striking her with a rock, sexually molesting her and
suffocating her with her own underwear, apparently in order to take
the bright blue bicycle she had been riding, the police said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile justice experts said they do not know of a case in this
country in which younger children have been prosecuted for murder.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and the police said on Monday that on Sunday evening
the boys confessed to the killing two weeks ago of the girl, Ryan
Harris, an honor student who had just finished fifth grade. After
killing Ryan in an alley behind a building on Chicago's South Side,
the 8-year-old rode his bike home and watched cartoons and the
7-year-old went home to play with a puppy, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the boys appeared for a probable cause hearing in
Juvenile Court, their feet swaying above the floor as they sat
before the judge. The 7-year-old, using colored pens, spent most of
the hearing drawing hearts, a house, and a rainbow on one of his
lawyer's yellow legal pads.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has seen several horrifying crimes involving children in
recent years, including a 1996 case in which two boys, 10 and 11,
dropped a 5-year-old boy to his death from the 14th floor of a
housing project. But the Ryan Harris case has struck an especially
painful nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this era, the ages of these offenders is very frightening
to hear about,'' said Mayor Richard M. Daley. ``Children are
growing up much, much faster.''

MICROSOFT INSISTS IT ISN'T A MONOPOLY, ASKS SUITS BE SCRAPPED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft does not have a monopoly on computer
operating systems, nor is it poised to gain a monopoly on Internet
browsers, the company's lawyers argued in court filings Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the lawyers said, the company is driven by fear of its
thriving rivals.
</P>
<P>
   After months of being depicted by its critics as a ravenous
giant that consumes or crushes its competitors, Microsoft offered a
new picture of the company as it urged a federal judge to dismiss
anti-trust lawsuits filed against the Redmond-based software
company by federal and state governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft would not continue to operate on the principle that
it must innovate or die if it believed for a moment that its
current market position was durable,'' the company argued in briefs
filed yesterday in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft spends hundreds of millions of dollars each year on
research and development precisely because it is afraid of being
overtaken by powerful competitors such as IBM, Novell, Oracle and
Sun or by companies that Microsoft does not know about or that may
not yet exist. That is hardly the image of the fat and lazy
monopolist from a Thomas Nast cartoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said that even if Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson doesn't throw out the cases, they are hopeful that he will
narrow them.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the government was unimpressed with the
company's latest legal briefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft said nothing new today,'' said Gina Talamona, a
spokeswoman for the Department of Justice. ``Ever since we brought
this case, Microsoft's position can't be squared with the company's
own documents, much less with the large body of evidence that will
be introduced at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the company is a monopoly is a central question in the
legal dispute between the attorneys general and Microsoft. The
government lawyers have argued that Microsoft has a monopoly on
computer operating systems and is violating the nation's anti-trust
laws by attempting illegally to extend that monopoly into the
market for Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft possesses (and for several years has possessed)
monopoly power in the market for personal computer operating
systems,'' the government wrote in its complaint May 18. ``To
protect its valuable Windows monopoly against such potential
competitive threats, and to extend its operating system monopoly
into other software markets, Microsoft has engaged in a series of
anti-competitive activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the illegally anti-competitive practices alleged by the
government: ``tying other Microsoft software products to
Microsoft's Windows operating system; exclusionary agreements
precluding companies from distributing, promoting, buying, or using
products of Microsoft's software competitors or potential
competitors; and exclusionary agreements restricting the right of
companies to provide services or resources to Microsoft's software
competitors or potential competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   But in its filings Monday, the company denied the illegally
anti-competitive practices alleged in the government complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you step back from all the heated rhetoric and apply
well-established legal principles to the actual facts of the case,
it is clear that the government will not be able to prove its
case,'' said William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for
law and corporate affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insisted that, despite supplying the operating system
used on at least 80 percent of personal computers, it has no
monopoly to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notwithstanding the popularity of Microsoft's operating system
software, Microsoft does not have the power unilaterally to raise
prices or exclude competition,'' the company argued. ``The software
industry is characterized by rapid and relentless innovation.
Microsoft's operating system competitors include IBM and Sun,
companies with enormous resources at their disposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said a company with a true monopoly on operating
systems would have dramatically raised prices for Windows 98 and
would not spend as much on research and development as does
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relatively rapid reversals in the fortunes of companies that
once had seemingly commanding leads are a frequent occurrence in
the software business,'' the company wrote. ``Products that provide
customers with significantly more value tend to leapfrog over
existing products, even those that were market leaders: witness the
collapse of Wang Laboratories in the now-defunct market for
standalone word processors.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argued that a June 23 appeals court decision upheld
its right to integrate its browser into its operating system _ an
action that the government believes is illegal. Microsoft also
argued that its actions have not hurt its major competitor in the
browser market, Netscape Communications Corp., because Netscape is
still widely distributing its product.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an effort to disguise the many problems with their legal
theories, which fly in the face of an opinion issued by the Court
of Appeals less than two months ago and are also contradicted by
the uncontested facts, plaintiffs seek to create the false
impression that Netscape posed a dire threat to Microsoft's
operating system software business and that Microsoft
systematically set about to destroy Netscape in order to eliminate
that threat,'' Microsoft wrote. ``It is a nice story, but that is
all it is _ a story.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove that it did not integrate its browser into the
operating system simply to squash Netscape, Microsoft said it
``began its consideration of providing support for Internet
standards in Windows 95, including web browsing functionality, in
1992,'' two years before Netscape was founded, and ``publicly
announced its intention to include web browsing functionality in
Windows 95 in April 1994.''
</P>
<P>
   But Netscape insists that Microsoft has limited its ability to
distribute its product by restrictive contracts with computer
manufacturers and Internet Service Providers. The company cites in
part a new study by Net Action, a consumer group critical of
Microsoft, that finds ``almost none of the largest Internet Service
Providers even give consumers the option to order an alternative to
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser and many will not give
technical support to consumers who install Netscape Navigator or an
alternative browser on their system.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape General Counsel Roberta Katz said Microsoft's practices
are hurting her company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our distribution is like a faucet, where we had a lot of water
coming through the pipes, and Microsoft, using its monopoly power,
started turning the faucet off,'' she said. ``They didn't turn the
faucet off (completely), so now they're saying, `why should
(Netscape) complain?' ''

 &HT;    Laid-back Martha's Vineyard awaits Clintons' fourth visit

<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ When the Clintons come to Martha's Vineyard
next week, some local folks will pack up and leave their beloved
island until the First Family finishes its vacation.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that they dislike President Clinton or even that they
dread the congestion and commotion that have accompanied him on
three previous late summer stays. But housing is scarce during
August, the seasonal peak, so some residents now rent their homes
to the legions of Secret Service agents, White House staffers and
journalists who descend on the picturesque isle seven miles off
Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Even the rush for lodging has become routine as laid-back
Martha's Vineyard awaits another presidential visit. Clinton is
scheduled to arrive the evening of August 17, the same day he
testifies on closed-circuit TV to the federal grand jury
investigating allegations that had a sexual affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky and sought to conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks on the Vineyard are used to the First Family coming here
for their vacation so it's not as exciting and as thrilling as it
was the first time,'' said John Alley, chairman of the West Tisbury
Board of Selectmen. ``The year-round residents have become rather
matter-of-fact about the whole thing, but the tourists who are here
for that particular day are all anxious to see the president. Of
course, we're pleased that he chooses to come to our community.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a community where celebrity is hardly a stranger. Seasonal
residents include Spike Lee, William Styron, Carly Simon, Walter
Cronkite, Ted Danson and wife Mary Steenburgen, Mike Wallace,
Robert McNamara and Diane Sawyer. A local couple, actress Susan St.
James and NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol, last year paid $4.2
million for a three acre compound with a stretch of beachfront. The
late Jackie Kennedy Onassis had a summer home here.
</P>
<P>
   Money _ old and new _ is also a familiar resident. The word
``summer'' is a verb here _ as in ``We summer on the Vineyard.''
Driveways on secluded coves can end at an information-industry
magnate's new beachfront mansion or the weathered, shingle-sided
cottage where a New England family has summered for five
generations.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, the Clintons will stay in the
waterfront home of Boston real estate developer Richard Friedman in
this historic whaling town, one of the half dozen villages on the
wooded, 100-square-mile island. Realtors said they must find houses
or hotel rooms for 200 or so White House staffers and Secret
Service agents and nearly that many reporters and media
technicians. Rents range from about $1,600 to $4,000 a week for a
suitable three-bedroom house, with federal taxpayers picking up the
tab for the Secret Service agents and presidential aides. That's on
the modest end of the island scale, however, as beachfront
properties rent for up to $80,000 for the month of August.
</P>
<P>
   With regular vacation housing booked long in advance, residents
have been recruited to leave while the Clintons stay. Last year,
four Secret Service agents stayed at the Sobotka home and the
family went sailing for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked very well. They were extremely low impact,'' said
Trina Sobotka. She said some of the agents' families must have
visited because her neighbors described a backyard barbecue with
``kids running around in Secret Service T-shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   This island _ spectacularly scenic where its bluffs and harbors
and beaches meet sparkling blue waters _ was discovered in 1602 by
English explorer Bartholomew Gosnold who was on his way to
Virginia. He named it for his daughter, Martha, and for the
abundant wild grapes found growing there.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel Hawthorne and Daniel Webster visited on the Vineyard
in earlier centuries. But the island's fame has grown globally
since the Clintons made it their vacation site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has put us on the map. If people didn't know where we
are after 'Jaws', (which was filmed on Martha's Vineyard), they
know now,'' said Barbara St. Pierre, owner of a real estate
reservations service that has been working with the White House
travel office.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Clintons arrive, at least, the highlight of this
social season has been the 20th annual ``Possible Dreams'' auction
which drew 1,500 islanders to the Harborside Inn courtyard on Aug.
3 and raised $460,000 for community services such as drug
counseling and visiting nurses. Columnist Art Buchwald served as
auctioneer and celebrity islanders fulfilled dreams for a price.
</P>
<P>
   Carly Simon's guitar, a personally written composition and
peanut butter sandwiches went for $40,000, for instance. Lunch with
Diane Sawyer and husband Mike Nichols at their home called Chip
Chop brought in $30,000. ``We'll play some tennis, too,'' promised
Nichols. A walk-on role in an episode of ``Ally McBeal'' _ the TV
series set in nearby Boston _ brought $21,000. The winning bid for
a beach walk with singer James Taylor was $13,000, and for an
afternoon sail with Walter Cronkite, $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Clintons will be welcomed with a round of
exclusive dinner parties, such as the affair they attended several
years ago honoring David McCullough, the Pulitzer Prize-winning
historian, at the home of Katharine Graham, whose family owns the
Washington Post. During the long summer days, though, the First
Family ventures into the villages to shop and eat at restaurants.
Indeed, during one of these forays, the president is alleged to
have bought souvenirs of the Black Dog Tavern _ trademark Vineyard
keepsakes _ for Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes a few visits into most of the towns, not just
Edgartown. But he's mostly here to swim, sail, play golf _ to do
what normal people do on vacation,'' said Thomas DeMont, owner of
the Edgartown Scrimshaw Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Geno Courtney came to the Vineyard from South Boston over 30
years ago as a barber. Now he owns Scoops ice cream parlor in
Edgartown and several T-shirt stores on the island. Among his
customers are hundreds of daytrippers who come by ferry for
shopping, seafood and sun but usually don't spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's coming does boost the economy and it gives the
working stiffs a chance to get a good look at the guy,'' said
Courtney. ``The only ones who might have a legitimate bitch (about
the presidential visit) are the golfers.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, during past visits, the president has played a round
almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty routine now _ almost just as if anyone else was
coming to play, with just a few special accommodations,'' said Mike
Zoll, head pro at the Farm Neck Golf Club where Clinton played in
the past with Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   An aide calls ahead to let the club know about when the
president will arrive, said Zoll. ``He generally hits a few balls
on the range, then lets us know when he's ready to play. We ask the
foursome on the first tee if they'd rather play in front of or
behind the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Most pass up the chance to watch Clinton drive and putt and go
first _ afraid of being held up by slow presidential play. But
that's an unfounded fear, said Zoll. ``The president is pretty
good. He's very strong. And he loves to play. He has a youthful
enthusiasm for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton usually plays with a member, the course is open
to any island visitor who calls two days ahead to reserve a tee
time. Greens fees are $80 and cart rental is $13.25 for 18 holes.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service last year gave about 20 minutes notice that
the Clintons were going to have brunch at The Sweet Life Cafe,
recalls Lesley Doctor, owner of the gourmet restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The president had duck hash and poached eggs. The First Lady had
oatmeal with dried cherries. They ate on the porch. And brunch
business picked up on the following Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential vacation ``does pump a lot of money into the
economy. I couldn't tell you exactly how much dollarwise, but I
expect there's a couple of million in transactions,'' said Alley,
the selectman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an immediate effect and a residual effect after he's
gone,'' said Randi Vega, executive director of the Martha's
Vineyard Chamber of Commerce. ``A lot of people want to go to the
restaurants where he ate. Some visitors heard of the island because
the Clintons come here. And we hear from some folks who don't want
to be here when he's here for whatever reasons and want to plan
their stays accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Trina Sobotka, who celebrated her 50th birthday last
year on a sailing cruise financed by renting her house to Secret
Service agents, is again considering leaving Martha's Vineyard to
the Clintons for their stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homeowners say the agents leave the houses cleaner than they
found them,'' laughed St. Pierre.

   OAK BLUFFS, Mass. _ This harbor town was founded on notions of
sin and redemption, so it is not surprising that scandalous
goings-on in Washington are a hot topic of conversation as Martha's
Vineyard prepares for President Clinton's vacation visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has demeaned the presidency,'' said Sue Chase,
sitting in a rocking chair on a front porch overlooking the
open-sided Camp Meeting Tabernacle where the Clintons often attend
church on their visits to the island.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 19th Century, the Tabernacle was the preaching
point for Methodist tent revivals that drew devout thousands to Oak
Bluffs. Over 300 cottages have been built on the former tent sites
and are summer homes to well-to-do folks like the Chases, who split
their year between Martha's Vineyard and Vero Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In their past three visits, the Clintons have attended Sunday
services at the Tabernacle. ``The only time it fills up is when
he's here,'' said Gordon Chase.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bill and Hillary Clinton stopped at the Chases' front
porch on their walk to brunch and chatted awhile. That was before
the world had heard of Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp's tapes, of
course, and now Sue Chase has a harsher assessment of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a brilliant man, but I don't have much respect for him,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone on Martha's Vineyard is likely to be rude enough
to bring up the subject when Clinton is actually around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think he's done an exceptional job as president
and that should take precedent over a lot of other things,'' said
Thomas DeMont, owner of the Edgartown Scrimshaw Gallery. ``I'll
give him the benefit of the doubt until he testifies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some talk on the island _ just like there is
everywhere else _ on the scandal. But I think it mirrors what the
national polls say: Let's get on with business,'' said John Alley,
chairman of the West Tisbury Board of Selectmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody really doesn't give a (expletive) about that no
more. It's gone on too long,'' said Geno Courtney, who owns several
island businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do souvenir T-shirts,'' he said. ``I'll probably do four for
his visit. But none about his personal life.''

 &HT;    Laid-back Martha's Vineyard awaits Clintons' fourth visit

<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ When the Clintons come to Martha's Vineyard
next week, some local folks will pack up and leave their beloved
island until the First Family finishes its vacation.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that they dislike President Clinton or even that they
dread the congestion and commotion that have accompanied him on
three previous late summer stays. But housing is scarce during
August, the seasonal peak, so some residents now rent their homes
to the legions of Secret Service agents, White House staffers and
journalists who descend on the picturesque isle seven miles off
Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Even the rush for lodging has become routine as laid-back
Martha's Vineyard awaits another presidential visit. Clinton is
scheduled to arrive the evening of August 17, the same day he
testifies on closed-circuit TV to the federal grand jury
investigating allegations that had a sexual affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky and sought to conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks on the Vineyard are used to the First Family coming here
for their vacation so it's not as exciting and as thrilling as it
was the first time,'' said John Alley, chairman of the West Tisbury
Board of Selectmen. ``The year-round residents have become rather
matter-of-fact about the whole thing, but the tourists who are here
for that particular day are all anxious to see the president. Of
course, we're pleased that he chooses to come to our community.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a community where celebrity is hardly a stranger. Seasonal
residents include Spike Lee, William Styron, Carly Simon, Walter
Cronkite, Ted Danson and wife Mary Steenburgen, Mike Wallace,
Robert McNamara and Diane Sawyer. A local couple, actress Susan St.
James and NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol, last year paid $4.2
million for a three acre compound with a stretch of beachfront. The
late Jackie Kennedy Onassis had a summer home here.
</P>
<P>
   Money _ old and new _ is also a familiar resident. The word
``summer'' is a verb here _ as in ``We summer on the Vineyard.''
Driveways on secluded coves can end at an information-industry
magnate's new beachfront mansion or the weathered, shingle-sided
cottage where a New England family has summered for five
generations.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, the Clintons will stay in the
waterfront home of Boston real estate developer Richard Friedman in
this historic whaling town, one of the half dozen villages on the
wooded, 100-square-mile island. Realtors said they must find houses
or hotel rooms for 200 or so White House staffers and Secret
Service agents and nearly that many reporters and media
technicians. Rents range from about $1,600 to $4,000 a week for a
suitable three-bedroom house, with federal taxpayers picking up the
tab for the Secret Service agents and presidential aides. That's on
the modest end of the island scale, however, as beachfront
properties rent for up to $80,000 for the month of August.
</P>
<P>
   With regular vacation housing booked long in advance, residents
have been recruited to leave while the Clintons stay. Last year,
four Secret Service agents stayed at the Sobotka home and the
family went sailing for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked very well. They were extremely low impact,'' said
Trina Sobotka. She said some of the agents' families must have
visited because her neighbors described a backyard barbecue with
``kids running around in Secret Service T-shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   This island _ spectacularly scenic where its bluffs and harbors
and beaches meet sparkling blue waters _ was discovered in 1602 by
English explorer Bartholomew Gosnold who was on his way to
Virginia. He named it for his daughter, Martha, and for the
abundant wild grapes found growing there.

STATE DEPT. HALTS A PIONEERING BOEING-RUSSIAN SPACE VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Worried that sensitive aerospace data were being transferred
overseas, the State Department has suspended all work between
Boeing and its Russian and Ukrainian partners in a pioneering
venture that would fire rockets into space from a floating platform
at sea.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said the department was working with
the Defense Department and was passing along the results to the
Customs and Justice Departments, which are looking into whether
Boeing's transfers broke any American laws. Neither Boeing nor the
government would spell out the nature of the offense that prompted
the suspension, and it was unclear whether the trouble was more
procedural than substantial.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing-led venture is known as Sea Launch. It seeks to adapt
Ukrainian and Russian rocket technologies to tap an emerging market
for the lofting of hundreds of communication satellites into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing characterizes the work as turning swords into plowshares.
Its Ukrainian partner, the Yuzhnoye design bureau and Yuzhmash
production plant, once made the Soviet Union's deadliest missile,
the SS-18.
</P>
<P>
   A recent investigation in Washington over whether American
aerospace companies aided Chinese rocket makers has brought the
Boeing venture and similar endeavors under close scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension took place on July 27 and forced up to 40 Russian
and Ukrainian engineers to leave the venture's home base in Long
Beach, Calif., Timothy L. Dolan, a Boeing spokesman, said on
Monday. Dolan had no estimate of how long the suspension might last
or whether it would delay the sea rocket's inaugural launching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting all our efforts into working with State to get
these matters resolved,'' he said. ``We want the suspension to be
as brief as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But a government official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said: ``This is a big project. We would not suspend it
unless there were serious concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolan said Sea Launch was responsible for about 10,000 jobs in
Ukraine and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important from that standpoint,'' he said. ``It's
very good for economic stability in that region. And it's a program
for which there was no existing template. Few of us have walked
this way before.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspension imposed without public announcement and was first
reported on Saturday in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department suspended Boeing's technical assistance
agreement, a federal official said on Monday. This plan, agreed to
by Boeing and the government in April 1995, spelled out the rules
by which the company would work with foreigners while protecting
sensitive data.
</P>
<P>
   A new plan is now being worked out, Boeing and federal officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Space experts said that the incident appeared to be part of a
pattern of tightening in matters of national security, prompted
mainly by the Chinese disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past few years, the climate has been to try to make
these joint ventures work, with only secondary emphasis on concerns
about technology transfer,'' said John M. Logsdon, director of the
Space Policy Institute, at George Washington University. ``Now the
pendulum is swinging back to more of a balance between economic and
security interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery in this case is that Russians and Ukrainians are
highly regarded as rocket makers, their work at times considered
superior to that of the United States, especially their efficient
engines. In contrast, Chinese rocketry is considered inferior.
</P>
<P>
   Charles P. Vick, a rocket expert at the Federation of American
Scientists, a private group in Washington, said the trouble might
have arisen because of integration problems in Sea Launch's rocket,
the Zenit.
</P>
<P>
   Vick said that the Ukrainian rocket had flown out of Russia in a
version with two stages but never with three, which is how Sea
Launch wants it to fly for greater lifting power. Boeing's mistake,
he said, may have been in supplying information to help tie an
additional stage to the existing Zenit, a process that can be
technically daunting. Boeing is an expert integrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The security for these kinds of things has increased
dramatically,'' Vick said. ``The question is how far this goes
before we start hurting ourselves'' with broken promises and missed
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The team's Zenit rocket was originally scheduled for its first
launching in October, Dolan said, but that date was recently pushed
back to early 1999 by the satellite customer in a delay unrelated
to the current investigation. The rocket's rise with a
communication satellite from a floating platform in the Pacific
would be a space-age first.

   Film magazine's list of the five cheesiest movie lines of all
time, as interpreted in prose fit for a family newspaper:
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Demi Moore &LR;  in ``G.I. Jane'' saying, ``(Sip through a straw)
my (Nixon's first name).''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Arnold Schwarzenegger &LR;  in ``The Last Action Hero''
threatening a rival, ``You want to be a farmer? Here's a couple of
ache-ers.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Leonardo DiCaprio  &LR; in ``Titanic'' proclaiming, ``I'm the king
of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Charlie Sheen &LR;  in ``Terminal Velocity'' boasting, ``I'm much
more than a walking (male genital). I'm a flying (male genital)!''
</P>
<P>
   And  &UR; Sean Connery &LR;  in ``Just Cause'' reasoning, ``If that's a
confession, my (donkey) is a banjo!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JOB DESCRIPTIONS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Disgraced Clinton friend  &UR; Webster Hubbell &LR;  reveals in his
memoir, ``Friends in High Places: Our Journey From Little Rock to
Washington, D.C.,'' that after Clinton was elected president, he
casually asked Hubbell if he would be coming to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When Hubbell said yes, reports the New York Review of Books,
Clinton suggested that he work in the Justice Department. The
president said there were two questions Hubbell might pursue: who
killed JFK, and whether UFOs are real.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was dead serious,'' writes Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speaker of the House  &UR; Newt Gingrich &LR;  has turned down an offer
from  &UR; Aaron Spelling &LR; , creator of ``Love Boat: The Next Wave,'' to
guest star in an episode. An invitation dated August 3 said that
having Gingrich on the show ``would be outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gingrich spokesman told Roll Call that the speaker had no
interest in the offer. The Washington newspaper also quoted ``one
GOP leadership aide'' (a description that sounds like the Gingrich
spokesman in sheep's clothing): ``Shouldn't that invitation have
been sent to the White House?''
</P>
<P>
   _ A sign flashing on BART TV announces that ``The IRS in Oakland
is looking for permanent part-time seasonal tax examiners,'' swell
work for intermittent curmudgeons.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A LENNON LEGACY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A  &UR; John Lennon &LR;  record album, ``Double Fantasy,'' that Lennon
autographed for  &UR; Mark David Chapman &LR; , the ``fan'' who killed him
five hours later, is being sold for $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The album is in the possession of autograph dealer  &UR; Gary &LR; 
 &UR; Zimet &LR; , who told the New York Post that he can prove its
provenance. ``There's no question of its authenticity,'' he said.
``It has the marks where fingerprints were lifted, it's signed by
detectives and stamped with case numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PET ISSUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ The happening new pet, says Teen People magazine, is the
Australian Sugar Glider, which is a pocket-size kangaroo-style
marsupial only six inches long. Further research indicates that
it's illegal to bring these animals into California.
</P>
<P>
   Herpeton Exotic Pets of Austin, Texas, which sells Gliders,
seems huffy about the ban. ``On biting, of course, any animal with
a mouth CAN bite. ... However, they hardly ever break the skin.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Boredom is the No. 1 cause of canine separation anxiety,''
says Dog Fancy magazine, which means that if Rover is chewing up
the sofa, it's because he hasn't got anything better to do.
</P>
<P>
   The holistic approach to curing this problem specifies adding
``variety to your dog's daily life. Explore a new route during your
evening walk. ... Leave a surprise package for your dog when you go
to work.'' At the same time, ``Start by eliminating as many sources
of stress for your dog as you can. Dogs are comforted by
predictability and schedules, so keep your daily routine on an even
keel and minimize changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Got that straight?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; CATERING TO THE TOM CLANCY READER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Last week's publication of the  &UR; Tom Clancy &LR;  novel ``Rainbow
Six'' will be followed in a few weeks with a computer game based on
the book. The game, the first to be inspired by a hardcover Clancy
book, is the product of Red Storm Entertainment, a company founded
by the best-selling author.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tom Clancy reader tends to be a little older,'' Red Storm
marketing man  &UR; Dick Wnuk &LR;  told Advertising Age. ``We feel we can
introduce Tom Clancy to a younger reader through this game and
really build his readership for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The game will utilize real footage of a SWAT team in action.

RECALLING SAM BALTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE JARES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sam Balter, the former athlete, teacher,
broadcaster and newspaper columnist who died over the weekend at
age 88, was a fine storyteller _ never better than when he was
reminiscing about being on the U.S. basketball team at the 1936
Olympics in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   With Adolf Hitler in power, the Jewish press in America had
tried to convince Jewish athletes not to participate. But Balter,
who had been captain of UCLA's 1928-29 team, elected to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the first Jewish athlete selected for the Games and I
was very conscious of being Jewish and going to Berlin,'' Balter
recalled. ``When we arrived, we were driven through the streets in
open-air buses and were greeted by several million Germans. Then we
stopped at city hall.... The first sound I remember hearing was a
rat-a-tat-tat and I actually thought it was a machine gun. It
turned out it was only the band striking up.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team was made up of 13 AAU players _ seven, including
Balter, from the Universal Pictures team, six from Globe Oil of
Kansas _ and one from the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball at the '36 Games was played outdoors, and the final
against Canada was played in the pouring rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final score was 19-8,'' said Balter, ``so you can imagine
what a travesty the whole thing was.''
</P>
<P>
   But Balter had a gold medal, one of many golden memories in a
remarkable career that included doing play-by-play on Cincinnati
Reds games in 1942, calling the first college football game shown
on TV in Southern California (USC vs. Utah in 1950) and appearing
(or providing an announcer's voice) in many movies, including
``Kiss Me Deadly,'' ``Joe Palooka Meets Humphrey,'' ``The
Pittsburgh Kid,'' three Superman adventures and, according to a
family friend, ``The Babe Ruth Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Balter, a columnist for the old L.A. Herald-Express, was also
part of a wonderful era of sports radio in the city. He was sports
director of KLAC from 1946-62 and for years had a 15-minute show of
news and commentary. Sports fans could hear him, Bob Kelley, Tom
Harmon and Cleve Hermann (and later Vin Scully) do controversial,
entertaining quarter-hour programs one right after the other.
Balter was the only one who wrote his own script.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam was very opinionated; he was the dean and let you know
it,'' recalled Goldy Norton, who wrote for rivals Hermann and
Scully. ``Cleve had the best voice, but Sam had the best delivery.
Like the late (national broadcaster) Bill Stern, he told dramatic
stories. But Sam's `One for the Book' tales were true. Stern's were
fiction.'' &UR; !dlim!!end!

EX-INDEPENDENT COUNSELS HAVE MIXED THOUGHTS ABOUT THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: A graphic on independent counsels since 1979 is being
sent to NYT graphics clients. Non-subscribers can make individual
purchase by calling 212-556-4204 or 1927.) 
(mk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are a rarefied roster of not quite two dozen, the men and
women who have served as independent counsels investigating high
government officials over the last 20 years. They have delved into
accusations of everything from cocaine use by a senior White House
aide to perjury, influence-peddling and favor-trading, and have
produced decidedly mixed results, from no indictments to
convictions to reversals on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them have been harshly criticized for taking too long,
spending too much or seeking to criminalize conduct that is rarely
prosecuted. But as Kenneth Starr's investigation of President
Clinton has moved from scrutiny of a tangled real estate investment
to intimations of intimacy with an intern, the law that created
independent counsels has come under attack as almost never before.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews in the last week with seven of the people who have
held the job since that law, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978,
was adopted in the wake of Watergate produced broad consensus that
the statute was needed but might have to be overhauled if it was to
be renewed by Congress when it expires next year.
</P>
<P>
   The former counsels were unanimous on one point: All were glad
to have served. But a majority also said that as currently written,
the law covered too many officials and too many potential acts of
wrongdoing, and left the attorney general too little discretion
about when to invoke it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be limited to activities that occur in office,''
said Lawrence Walsh, who spent six years and $40 million
investigating the Iran-contra affair and whose suggestions for
changes were among the most sweeping. ``It should be limited to
misuse of government power and should not include personal mistakes
or indiscretions. The enormous expense of an independent counsel's
investigation and the disruption of the presidency should not be
inflicted except for something in which there was a misuse of
power. That's not out of consideration for the individual; it's out
of consideration for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the former counsels generally declined to comment on
Starr's investigation, virtually all of them also said that wide
experience as a criminal prosecutor or a defense lawyer _
experience that Starr does not have _ should be a requirement for
the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe strongly in the concept of an independent counsel to
guarantee public confidence in the impartiality of any criminal
investigation into conduct of top officials in the executive branch
of our government,'' said Whitney North Seymour Jr., who won a
perjury conviction against Michael Deaver, a former top aide to
President Reagan who was accused of lying about his lobbying
activities after leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' Seymour continued, in comments generally echoed by
his colleagues, ``appointments to that position should be limited
to lawyers with proven good judgment and extensive prior experience
in gathering admissible evidence, developing corroboration and
satisfying the trial standard of reasonable doubt. We simply cannot
afford the spectacle of on-the-job-training in such a sensitive
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Arthur Christy was appointed in 1979 to investigate
accusations that Hamilton Jordan, President Carter's White House
chief of staff, had used cocaine at Studio 54 _ a case that ended
with no indictments _ there have been a total of 20
independent-counsel investigations, some conducted by more than one
prosecutor. The names of the targets of two investigations in the
Bush era, and the counsels who conducted them, were sealed by court
order. One investigator, Robert Fiske Jr., was appointed by
Attorney General Janet Reno in 1994, at a time when the law had
expired, and was replaced four years ago last week by a three-judge
federal panel that chose Starr instead, but Fiske had essentially
all the same powers.
</P>
<P>
   Five investigations of Clinton administration officials,
including Starr's, are still pending, and Ms. Reno remains under
intense pressure to ask the judicial panel for yet another
prosecutor, to look into campaign finance abuses. No effort was
made to interview those conducting active investigations, or the
counsel who ended his investigation of Commerce Secretary Ronald
Brown after Brown's death in a plane crash in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A common theme in the remarks of the seven former counsels who
agreed to be interviewed was the momentous power and isolation of
the job, a parallel universe of solitude and solemn responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of individual power, I never had anything like
this,'' said Walsh, who had served as a federal district judge and,
in the Eisenhower administration, deputy attorney general. ``Night
after night, I'd wake up in the middle of the night. I kept a
notebook by my bed, and the only way I could get back to sleep was
to write down whatever was bothering me. I'd worry about my travel
expenses, thinking, `This is going to seem very high.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fiske forsook the companionship of the only four friends he knew
he Little Rock, Ark., who all happened to be leading lawyers there,
when he set up shop to investigate Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   Scholarly critics of the independent counsel law, including a
Supreme Court justice, Antonin Scalia, have argued that it creates
built-in incentives for prosecutors to pursue evidence and avenues
of inquiry that law-enforcement officials might otherwise decide
were never likely to bear fruit. The incentives: simply the intense
political pressure and public scrutiny that surround any
appointment, and the requirement that the prosecutor produce a
detailed public report justifying the findings.
</P>
<P>
   That concern was also common among the former prosecutors
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ought to be some way to limit the ability of an
independent counsel to expand his or her investigation, to keep
their eye on the original target they were initially appointed to
investigate,'' said James McKay, whose conviction of Lyn Nofziger,
a former Reagan aide charged with violating ethics laws on
lobbying, was overturned on appeal after an inquiry that lasted 14
months and cost $3 million. ``When you think of how the Starr
investigation started with Fiske and Whitewater and now what's
become of it, it just seems that there should be some way to have
prevented that from occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Di Genova, who ultimately brought no charges after a
three-year, $2.2 million investigation into accusations that senior
Bush administration officials improperly sought information from
Bill Clinton's passport files during the 1992 campaign, was the
sole former prosecutor to condemn the law altogether, and he said
it should not be renewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the usual governors, both legal and practical, are
absent, because of the special nature of the statute,'' said
DiGenova, who argues that once the law is invoked, prosecutors are
forced to bring ``an unnatural degree of targeted attention'' to
the case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fiske, who like Walsh and DiGenova thinks any law should cover
investigation of only the president, the vice president and the
attorney general rather than the 75 or so senior government and
party officials now automatically covered, also worries about the
potential for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the person is selected, it's like recalling a missile,''
Fiske said. ``You can't recall it, and it's kind of unguided,
except by its own. And so all these things are judgment calls.''
</P>
<P>
   But like his colleagues, Fiske emphasized that a prosecutor
ultimately had wide discretion over what to pursue, and he recalled
that after David Hale, a former municipal judge in Arkansas, had
pleaded guilty and begun cooperating in the Whitewater case, he
provided much useful information, along with accusations that
seemed far afield.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of other things that David Hale told us that
we could have investigated under our charter,'' he recounted ``but
I just said, `This is too far removed from what we were supposed to
be doing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the prosecutors expressed concern that the current
law led too easily to the appointment of independent counsels.
Every time the attorney general receives ``specific and credible''
allegations of wrongdoing by an official covered under the act, she
has 30 days to decide, without compelling anyone's testimony,
whether a preliminary investigation is warranted. If she concludes
that it is, then she must decide within 90 days whether there are
``reasonable grounds'' to believe that further investigation is
warranted. If there are, she must apply to the special three-judge
court for appointment of an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That time limit now is too brief,'' McKay said.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the former prosecutors, who spoke only on the
condition of anonymity, said that the law was sound as written and
that complaints that it invited prosecutorial vendettas were
overblown. Seymour also rejected complaints of unbridled power,
saying he had had no more leeway as independent counsel than he had
earlier had as U.S. attorney in Manhattan in the Nixon
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States attorney for the Southern District has
almost unlimited power,'' Seymour said. ``How the responsibility is
carried out is another question.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly another former independent counsel, Alexia Morrison,
said that the law did not need any major changes and that ``there's
been a very successful campaign to lay faults at the foot of the
statute when in fact it is conduct that got us here.'' Asked
whether she meant conduct by Clinton, Starr or both, Ms. Morrison
simply repeated her assertion.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ms. Morrison's investigation into whether Theodore Olson,
an assistant attorney general in the Reagan administration, misled
Congress in a dispute over toxic waste cleanup that led to the 1988
Supreme Court ruling unholding the independent counsel law. And
though she ultimately brought no charges after a 30-month, $1.5
million investigation, she, like many of her colleagues, said that
very result underscored one of the most important features of the
law, because it enhanced the public's confidence that nothing had
been covered up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a heck of a lot of very troublesome investigations
that have been resolved without bringing any criminal charges,''
Ms. Morrison said, ``and there was not a situation in which anyone
came back and said, `That's outrageous.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fiske, too, said that in the absence of such a law, there would
seldom be significant public controversy if high officials were
charged and brought to trial, whatever the outcome, but that ``the
problem is when the case isn't brought'' because a prosecutor
decides there is not enough evidence or likelihood of success. ``In
many respects,'' he said, ``that is where you need the independent
counsel most of all.''
</P>
<P>
   But for alleged misdeeds that may have occurred before a senior
official took office, Walsh and Ms. Morrison said, the solution
should be to extend the statute of limitations for any such crimes
and investigate after the official leaves office, though Ms.
Morrison acknowledged that this could pose its own problems, in
terms of stale evidence or lost witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In one way or another, all the former counsels who were
interviewed deplored the partisanship now surrounding an office
that grew out of bipartisan concern over Nixon's ``Saturday night
massacre'' of the first Watergate special prosecutor, Archibald
Cox, and the two highest officials of the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become so politicized now,'' McKay said, ``that the ins
hate it and the outs love it just for the purpose of bringing the
ins down. That's the part that will turn the public sour.''
</P>
<P>
   Seymour agreed, saying: ``It plainly has gotten a bad name. And
that comes from the public perception of recent events, and I think
that's unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   DiGenova contended that Cox's dismissal was the exception that
proved the rule, particularly since the Watergate inquiry continued
under additional until Nixon's downfall. ``There's no way that a
sitting president can possibly prevent his own investigation by
firing anybody, because the political process will not permit it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morrison said it remained unclear whether the public would
continue to support the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of the previous independent counsels have been
able to achieve a result with a general sense of public confidence
that the way they got there was appropriate,'' she said. ``But hold
your breath. It may be that Starr can spin out a report that tells
an incredibly interesting tale that puts the lie to most of the
procedural and substantive assaults on him. On the other hand, if
it looks like he hasn't produced so much, and has used an elephant
gun on a flea, then maybe that won't be so well regarded.''

IRS CHIEF TO NAME EXECUTIVE TEAM TO REMAKE AGENCY
</HEADLINE>
   (ll) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti, using the broad powers
Congress gave him last month to pick his executive team to remake
the beleaguered agency, will appoint two deputies and a chief
computer executive on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   John LaFaver, the Kansas revenue secretary, will be named the
deputy commissioner for modernization, said two officials familiar
with the selections. LaFaver, who previously was tax commissioner
in Maine and Montana, built a name for himself in the last three
years by installing new technology and adopting a new attitude
toward Kansas taxpayers, whom he calls customers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wenzel, a career IRS official, will be named deputy
commissioner for operations. Wenzel was running the IRS service
center in Fresno, Calif., which processes tax returns filed in
California, when he was summoned back to Washington this year to
work on improving service to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The third major post, that of chief information officer, will be
filled by Paul Cosgrove, who was president and chief executive of
Claremont Technology Group and previously was a managing director
for Anderson Consulting, which has contracts to modernize tax
systems in California, Texas and several foreign countries. For the
past month, Cosgrove has been working as a technology consultant to
the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The three are expected to work from a blueprint developed by
Arthur Gross. That blueprint showed how to use mainframe computers,
coupled with servers and work stations, to allow individual IRS
workers to have all the information needed to work with taxpayers.
In February, Gross resigned as chief information officer after he
and Rossotti clashed on how to implement the blueprint. Gross is
now chief information officer at Albany Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of taxpayer service that Rossotti envisions can be seen
on a small scale at the Kansas Department of Revenue, which
collects as much money in a year as the IRS does in a day.
</P>
<P>
   LaFaver posted every Kansas tax policy on the Internet and had
the department's computer systems so thoroughly integrated that
when a taxpayer calls with a problem, all the information needed to
resolve it, including images of tax returns, can be called up
almost instantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most tax problems can be solved in about nine seconds if the
tax people have the information needed to help their customer,''
LaFaver said in June.

AUTOMATION LESSENS PHONE STRIKE IMPACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp. customers waiting for directory &UR;  &LR; assistance,
installations, and other services can expect more delays as the
strike continues, but the overall impact Monday was muted because
so much of the phone company's operations today are automated &UR;  &LR; and
because Bell Atlantic managers filled in.
</P>
<P>
   Local phone customers in Massachusetts found some directory
assistance calls taking slightly longer than usual. In New York,
directory assistance callers faced longer delays and were greeted
by the recorded message, ``Due to a work stoppage, we are unable to
provide an operator at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   A directory assistance call to New Hampshire and another to New
Jersey were answered immediately.
</P>
<P>
   A Bell Atlantic spokesman said several other customer services
were experiencing ``a slowdown,'' including billing inquiries,
ordering new telephone services, or changing existing services.
</P>
<P>
   The company's 23,000 managers are filling in for the striking
workers in the 13 states between Maine and Virginia that Bell
Atlantic serves. Nearly all the managers are expected to work
six-day, 12-hour shifts, said a Bell Atlantic spokesman.
Anticipating a possible strike, the managers were told in June to
cancel any vacation plans in August, a source close to Bell
Atlantic said.
</P>
<P>
   The strike by 73,000 members of the Communications Workers of
America, which began Sunday, is the first since local telephone
service was officially deregulated by the 1996 Telecommunications
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Bell Atlantic shares closed at 41 3/16, down 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Several Wall Street analysts said a short strike will not affect
the company financially, but the interruption could lead some Bell
Atlantic customers to explore other options for local service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still early, but if this is a protracted strike and
business customers need more phone lines, service, and maintenance
performed, they may turn to us,'' said John F. Kelley, director of
operations in Boston for Teleport Communications Group, an AT&AMP;T
Corp. unit that is a Bell Atlantic rival and has more than 500
business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic customers and competitors said the impact from the
strike will be minimal because all are increasingly using computers
and highly skilled software engineers, reducing the need for phone
company personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much of 80 percent of our work does not need human
intervention,'' said Robert T. Hale Jr., president of Network Plus
Inc. of Quincy, which provides Internet and phone services. some of
which overlap with Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the increasing dependence on computers and other
technologies that could reduce the number of unionized jobs is at
the heart of the strike at Bell Atlantic.

METS TRUMPING CRITICS IN QUEST FOR WILD CARD  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The problem _ one of the problems _ with wild-card contenders is
that they are also-rans, and worse, they often play like also-rans.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, the National League's collection of
wild-card contenders has demonstrated precisely that condition.
These teams have shown why they are not contenders for division
championships.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs, for example, have led the wild-card division
for the last three weeks since overtaking the San Francisco Giants,
who tumbled out of the lead by losing 12 of 15 games. But the Cubs
just dropped all three games of a weekend series to St. Louis, a
team that deservedly has a losing record.
</P>
<P>
   While the Cubs were enduring a lost weekend in St. Louis, the
Giants had one of their own right at home, losing all three games
to Atlanta. At least the Giants had an excuse. The Braves are the
best team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets could have supplanted the Cubs in first place in the
league's fourth division by sweeping their three weekend games in
Colorado, but they lost the third game Sunday, leaving them half a
game behind going into Monday night's games. Two out of three isn't
bad, just not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the way the NL wild-card chase has gone. The Mets
actually have been the best team in the group recently.
</P>
<P>
   Since they and the Cubs evenly divided a four-game series the
last week of last month, leaving the Mets three and a half games
behind the Cubs, the Mets have won two of three from San Diego,
split a four-game series with Los Angeles and taken two of three
from the Giants and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs won two and lost two to Arizona, took two of three from
the Rockies, lost two of three to the Diamondbacks and lost three
to the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have had one good series in that same span, sweeping
four games in Philadelphia and virtually knocking the Phillies out
of wild-card contention. The Phillies went on to lose two of three
to San Diego and all three weekend games to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are the other contender. After suffering a
near-death experience in New York, emerging with a split because
the Mets' incendiary bullpen gave them two victories, they went to
Montreal and, incredibly, lost all three games.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Phillies, the Dodgers could have declared themselves
out of the race right then and there, before they even re-entered
the country, but the Cubs graciously let them back in. The Dodgers
provided some self-help, too, beating Pittsburgh two of three times
during the weekend and slicing their deficit from six games to
four.
</P>
<P>
   It is a waste of time and energy to belabor the question of
where the Mets might be if their relief corps hadn't torpedoed
their recent efforts. That John Franco has a weird way of showing
he deserves a two-year contract extension; that the Mets might have
been wiser leaving Greg McMichael in Los Angeles, where he could
have thrown volatile pitches for the Dodgers and undermined their
wild-card chances; that Mel Rojas is more frightening when he comes
into pitch than a haunted house, are all givens.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go from there. If these are the potholes the Mets must
avoid, if they are the obstacles they have to overcome, that is
their fate; that is their task. The point is that the Mets, with
seven weeks left in the season, are in excellent position to make
the playoffs as the wild-card team.
</P>
<P>
   No team has enough talent to dominate the race the rest of the
season. All of the teams have holes and shortcomings; otherwise,
they would be challenging the Braves, the Padres and the Astros for
division championships.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, for example, either playing poorly or conceding to the
Astros now that they have Randy Johnson, entered their game in San
Francisco Monday night farther away from Houston _ seven and a half
games _ than they had been at any time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have scrambled to acquire hitters and relief pitchers
to shore up their sagging chances, but Joe Carter, one of the
hitters, isn't hitting .200, and Jose Mesa, one of the relievers,
has given away as many games recently as Franco.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have shuffled and reshuffled themselves throughout
the season, like a person changing hairstyles and clothes in an
attempt to create an acceptable personality. They may still not
have it right.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, too, have done their share of scrambling and
bolstering, not all of which has been beneficial. But here they
are, within grasp of a playoff spot their critics were convinced
would be beyond their reach this season.
</P>
<P>
   With Tony Phillips igniting their offense, John Olerud and Brian
McRae supplying key hits, Mike Piazza showing glimpses of being the
productive hitter they thought they acquired and a starting
pitching rotation that keeps them in games, the Mets could snatch
the spot in spite of their bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   They no longer are Terry Malloy of ``On the Waterfront,'' who
coulda been a contender. They are a contender and have good reason
to believe they will be the successful contender.

 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Livent Inc., the producer of such Broadway shows as
``Ragtime'' and ``Show Boat,'' announced Monday that an internal
investigation had found serious accounting problems involving
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new managers, led by Michael Ovitz, the former
Hollywood power broker, said that they were ``virtually certain''
that the company's financial results dating back to the beginning
of 1996 would have to be restated.
</P>
<P>
   After an emergency meeting of the board in Toronto on Monday
morning, the company suspended Garth Drabinsky, the impresario who
built the company from a single production in a Toronto theater
into a roster of shows in a network of theaters from Times Square
to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky had been in charge of both the creative and the
financial sides of the company before Ovitz and other executives
took over on June 12. Also suspended from his job was Myron
Gottlieb, a vice president, who co-founded the company with
Drabinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Livent's management said in a written statement that the
accounting irregularities involve the improper recognition of
revenue and the failure to record expenses. But executives said
they could not yet say precisely how much money was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Executives said that the financial problems would not affect any
of the company's current shows or its ambitious plans for the
future. Last week, Livent agreed to lease the last unclaimed
historic theater on 42nd Street, the long-dormant Times Square
Theater. The 500-seat theater is next door to the company's Ford
Theater, where ``Ragtime'' is selling out almost every night.
</P>
<P>
   But some entertainment-industry analysts said Monday that the
announcement was another sign of the trouble at a company that has
been struggling to pay its millions of dollars of debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't bode particularly well for Livent,'' said Edward
Lawrence, an entertainment-industry analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's,
the bond-rating agency. The agency lowered the company's credit
rating Monday to ``B plus'' from ``BB minus'' after management's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, Livent has borrowed heavily to build
theaters _ notably the Ford Centers for the Performing Arts in New
York, Chicago, and Vancouver, British Columbia. The Chicago theater
is scheduled to open in October.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence said it was ``too early to tell'' if the company could
continue with its plans, because management had not yet given
enough details of the problems that it began uncovering late last
week. ``Most people are still in the dark,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Ovitz, who left Disney Corp. in December 1996, paid
$20 million for a 12 percent stake in Livent, the world's only
publicly held company whose primary business is live theater
production. The deal also gave Ovitz control of 36 percent of the
voting rights in Livent.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz joined the company as a board member and chairman of the
executive committee in June. And he brought with him Roy Furman, an
investment banker who replaced Drabinsky as chairman and chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   While Drabinsky gave up his financial responsibilities, he
remained the company's chief creative director. And Gottlieb, who
had been the company's president, became a vice president for
Canadian administration.
</P>
<P>
   Livent had long been known on Broadway for its aggressive
accounting techniques. But early this year, Ovitz and Furman had
brought in the accounting firm KPMG and the Wall Street law firm
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom, to review the company's
records for problems before they took over in June. Nothing in
those reviews found anything that deterred the new management from
taking over.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the situation said that management began
uncovering accounting problems late last week that were
``significantly different'' from anything that the company had been
criticized for before. Those problems were discovered as
accountants were preparing the second quarter's financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Management had found that some of the company's ``transactions''
contained arrangements that the board had not known about that
could financially hurt the company, those sources said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, management had found that certain costs had been
shifted between accounts, the sources said, so that they could
remain on the accounting books as a capitalized asset instead of
being written off and reducing profits.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in one case, the costs of a show that was about to
close might have been moved to another account so that they would
not reduce the company's profits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many of the company's board members had long known and been
friends with Drabinsky. But at Monday's meeting, the board voted
unanimously to suspend both Drabinsky and Gottlieb and to hire KPMG
for a detailed investigation of the accounting problems. After more
review, the board will decide whether the men should keep their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an unhappy and tragic situation,'' said one source
when asked about the events at Monday's board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Drabinsky and Gottlieb said the men were not
available for comment. But in a written statement, the men said
they were ``surprised and dismayed at concerns raised by the new
senior management.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has provided few details,'' the statement said,
``and no practical opportunity for us to address or respond to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's statement noted that KPMG had reviewed Livent's
accounting practices before Ovitz and Furman took over in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``New management was provided ample opportunity, prior to
closure of the transaction, to raise any accounting concerns,'' the
statement said. ``We are hopeful of a resolution that will be in
the best interests of Livent's shareholders and business partners,
and that will respect its artistic relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's auditing firm, Deloitte &AMP; Touche, said Monday that
it was ``deeply concerned'' about Monday's announcement. A
spokeswoman for the accounting firm said that the auditors would
fully cooperate with the company's board as the investigation
continues.
</P>
<P>
   Management said that the accounting problems should not have
significantly hurt the company's cash flow. But the problems could
cause the company to default on its debt obligations, executives
said. On Monday the Canadian exchange stopped all trading on the
stock because of management's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Livent's newest musical, ``Fosse: A Celebration in Song and
Dance,'' opened on Sunday in Toronto, just hours before the company
announced the accounting problems. The show is scheduled to play in
Boston in September.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gersten, executive producer for Lincoln Center Theater,
said that the company's announcement took him by surprise, because
he had met with Drabinsky and Furman only last week. But Gersten
said that ``Parade,'' a musical developed by Livent that is
scheduled to open at Lincoln Center in September, would go on.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Livent fell to $10.15 (Canadian) on the Toronto Stock
Exchange before trading was halted. On the Nasdaq market, the stock
rose to $6.75.

UNEASY ABOUT TIMING OF FUND-RAISERS, CLINTON SHORTENS TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ President Clinton began a transcontinental
fund-raising spree Monday, but his spokesman said that the
president felt uncomfortable on the political circuit so soon after
the bombings at two United States embassies in Africa, and as a
result he was cutting short his time on the road.
</P>
<P>
   But he is missing only one fund-raising event and plans to
attend five others, three in California for Lt. Gov. Gray Davis,
who is running for governor. At each of the receptions on Tuesday
for Davis _ one in San Francisco and two in Los Angeles _ Clinton
is expected to raise $1 million from some of the Democratic Party's
biggest donors, in all $3 million in eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with a dinner here Monday night for Sen. Carol
Moseley-Braun and other Democratic candidates, and a luncheon
Monday afternoon in Louisville, Ky., for Rep. Scotty Baesler, who
is running for the Senate, Clinton is expected to raise more than
$4 million in two days.
</P>
<P>
   But as television screens filled with images of bodies being
removed from the rubble in Kenya and Tanzania, Clinton decided late
Sunday to return to Washington on Wednesday morning instead of
early on Thursday, as originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president felt it was important to come back,'' said his
spokesman, Joe Lockhart. ``He was not really comfortable being out
three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is preparing to testify to a grand jury next Monday
in the Monica S. Lewinsky investigation, is scheduled to take a
late-night flight back to Washington, arriving at dawn on
Wednesday. He plans to meet with his national security advisers
later on Wednesday and to attend a memorial ceremony at Andrews Air
Force Base on Thursday, when the remains of the 12 Americans killed
in Africa are scheduled to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   But his change in plans will not affect much else. He is
canceling an anti-crime event in Los Angeles that has yet to be set
up anyway, the kind of quasi news, issue-related set piece that
presidents typically stage so they can charge taxpayers for at
least part of the cost of their political fund-raising trips.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also miss a nighttime rally in Milwaukee for
Wisconsin Democrats, including Sen. Russell D. Feingold. This event
was the smallest money-wise on Clinton's schedule, with 700 people
contributing a total of $100,000. But they will still see a
Clinton: his wife, Hillary, was to fill in for him.
</P>
<P>
   In their enduring efforts to portray Clinton as not being
distracted by the Lewinsky investigation, White House officials
Monday cast the president as overseeing the latest developments in
the bombings in Africa. But they were quick to assert that he could
stay in charge even while traveling because of the advanced
communications systems aboard Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the ability to fully fulfill his responsibilities as
Commander in Chief,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Given that ability, it was not entirely clear why Clinton felt
it was so urgent to cut his trip short _ or if it was that urgent,
why he even left Washington. But Clinton has not allowed much time
to prepare for his testimony regarding his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he wanted to keep his financial commitments to
Davis and to his hosts, Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood producer,
and Bruce Karatz, the biggest home-builder in California.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton suggested in Louisville that teams in Africa were
successfully tracking clues to the bombings. ``They are searching
and finding evidence,'' he said. But otherwise, his public comments
on the bombing were restricted to asking for a moment of silence in
honor of the dead, stating the nation's resolve in the face of
terrorism, and vowing to bring the ``murderers'' to justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be strong in dealing with this,'' the president said.
``There is no way out if we start running away from this kind of
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   But the main event in Louisville concerned the ``patients' bill
of rights'' that is moving through Congress. Clinton told an
enthusiastic crowd at the Commonwealth Convention Center that he
would veto the bill being backed by the Republican leaders, a bill
that he said did not offer enough protection for patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a bill of rights, not a bill of goods,'' Clinton said.
If Congress passes the Republican bill, ``I will be forced to veto
it.''

SHARES CONTINUE TO RETREAT AS INVESTORS LOSE DIRECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (js)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors seemed to be asking, ``Where do we go from
here?'' as they warily eyed the stock market in the wake of last
week's rout.
</P>
<P>
   Since last Tuesday's 299.43-point plunge in the Dow Jones
industrial average, most market pundits have called for a continued
downdraft near term, before the market again picks up steam.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts of earnings growth in the third quarter were quickly
ratcheted lower; analysts now see earnings for companies in the
Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks growing 6.4 percent this
year, down from the 15.1 percent forecast on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Now investors seem to be taking a defensive stance. ``There are
no heroes,'' said Charles Johnson, head equity trader at Blaylock &AMP;
Partners in Baltimore. ``No one wants to be the first one out
there. People are not quite sure what's going on, so they're
waiting for someone else to give them direction.''
</P>
<P>
   A rally among small-company shares, which rose smartly late last
week, faltered on Monday, leaving the Russell index of 2,000
smaller-company stocks closing lower than it had a week earlier.
The Russell fell 4.16 points, to 411.64, a 1 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   Drug company shares rose, helping stem further declines among
larger-company stocks. Investors bought shares of Merck, Warner
Lambert and Schering-Plough, as they sought a haven from continued
Asian weakness. Some fear that Japan's woes could force China to
devalue its currency.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the purchases should help the health care sector,
down 8.9 percent since July 17, rebound soon.
</P>
<P>
   While domestic equity markets were little changed, prices fell
in Asia, Latin America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent market rout _ from the highs on July 17 through
last Friday _ financial stocks were the worst performers among the
11 sectors that make up the S&AMP;P 500, down 12 percent, and they fell
again on Monday, largely because of exposure to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   JP Morgan fell 3 5/16, to 120 3/16, accounting for more than
half the decline in the Dow industrials, which fell 23.17 points,
to 8,574.85. The S&AMP;P 500 lost 6.31, to 1,083.14. The Nasdaq
composite index fell 7.56, closing at 1,839.21.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those declines, a number of analysts are optimistic that
financial shares will soon resume their place as stellar
performers.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, said brokerage-firm stocks might have been hurt by the
decline in initial public offerings and a lack of investor
confidence in the market. He foresees no recession, however, and
predicts that the environment of low inflation will be good for
financials, retailers and home builders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a buying opportunity,'' said Raphael Soifer,
financial services analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. Although, he
said, financial stocks would probably be volatile near term, ``when
the market turns up, we expect them to lead.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Longer term, he likes Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Bankers Trust,
Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Farrell, a quantitative analyst with Aeltus Investment
Management in Hartford, predicts that savings and loans will
continue to falter, as low interest rates increase the risk that
borrowers will prepay mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   In the next six to 12 months, Galvin believes that financials,
health care, and technology stocks will resume their roles as
market leaders. Since July 17, health care stocks have fallen 8.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care companies will continue to be under pressure
because of the Medicare reimbursement process, Galvin added.
</P>
<P>
   Although recent stock market declines scuttled United
Healthcare's planned purchase of its rival, Humana, consolidations
in the industry are likely to continue, he said, because few
managed-care programs have been very cost effective.
</P>
<P>
   While technology companies were toppled early by Asia's malaise,
they have been one of the better performing sectors in the S&AMP;P 500
since the July highs _ down just 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks like Compaq, Intel and Motorola, which declined as much
as 25 percent in the second quarter, should reverse those declines,
as inventories shrink and seasonal demand for computers picks up,
analysts said. As a result, the outperformance of telephones and
utilities, a defensive play, should be outlived. The communication
sector fell just 5 percent in the period. &QL;

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Frustrated by unfulfilled promises of
prosperity, hundreds of Haitians are abandoning their impoverished
nation for a new life that begins on South Florida beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Since spring, 173 Haitians were taken into custody coming ashore
in Florida's Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties. Hundreds
more have been turned back by the U.S. Coast Guard on the high
seas.
</P>
<P>
   An incalculable number make it to shore under cover of night and
blend into Haitian-American communities, community leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say there is a boat coming in every other day,'' said
Daniella Henry, coordinator of the Haitian American Community
Council in Riviera Beach. She said the boats probably bring from 50
to 60 Haitian a week.
</P>
<P>
   The tide of Haitian immigrants this summer is the largest since
the political turmoil from 1991 to 1994 caused by the Haitian
military's ouster of democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Haitians had hoped for when Aristide returned isn't what
they have received,'' said the Rev. Mario Roosevelt Lusma, a
Haitian-American pastor and radio commentator in West Palm Beach.
He said Haiti's poor economy and soaring cost of living are forcing
the migration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still some political pressures, but they are trying
to flee to get a better life,'' Lusma said.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 Haitians a month are intercepted on the high seas by
U.S. Coast Guard patrol boats, said Miami-based Petty Officer Jeff
Hall. About half of those are found near Haiti and the rest are
caught between the Bahamas and Florida's coastline.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are small compared to the thousands who were coming
each month before Aristide was restored to power by a U.S. invasion
of Haiti in 1994, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet problems persist in Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest
nation. In 1996, President Rene Preval succeeded Aristide. Since
then, political infighting has cost the Caribbean nation stability
and at least $150 million in foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the immigrants making landfall on Florida beaches spend
about two or three weeks in the Bahamas arranging passage with
smugglers, said Keith Roberts, assistant chief agent for the U.S.
Border Patrol station in Pembroke Pines.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said he doesn't know if more Haitians are coming now
than in past years. He attributed the increase in arrests to tips
from coastal police agencies and the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing more cases, a slight spike in the numbers,''
Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jan. 1, the Border Patrol has arrested 258 immigrants
making landfall from Boca Raton to Fort Pierce. Among those were
173 Haitians, 58 Indians, 14 Ecuadoreans and 13 Cubans. Most of the
Haitians come in small boats from the Bahamas and during the summer
months when the seas are calmer.

 &HT;    Group from Haiti smuggled to U.S. waters, left on sandbar; one
dead

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A 25-year-old Haitian woman drowned
Monday when a smuggler left her and 32 other immigrants on a
sandbar about 100 yards off Florida's Jupiter Inlet.
</P>
<P>
   Benette Dorsonne struggled in heavy surf after one or more
smuggling boats dropped the immigrants on the sandbar south of the
inlet at about 4:30 a.m. The sandbar was in waist-deep water, and
the immigrants were told to swim the final 100 yards of deeper
water, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's investigators said Dorsonne's body washed ashore at
5:45 a.m., five minutes before the first rescue boat _ a 21-foot
inflatable Coast Guard raft reached the sandbar. The Coast Guard
delayed its rescue of 13 immigrants who were still stranded on the
sandbar until a larger sheriff's boat arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Five police agencies responded to the earliest report, which
came from a pre-dawn fisherman who flagged down a Jupiter patrol
officer at 4:55 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our report was that people were screaming out in the water,''
said Officer John Roberts of the U.S. Coast Guard based in Riviera
Beach. A sheriff's helicopter pilot confirmed that from the air.
Then another Jupiter patrol officer found two soaked Haitian males
at the intersection of State Road A1A and Indiantown Road.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving immigrants, including 19 who successfully swam to
shore, told investigators that they paid $350 to board two boats at
Freeport, Bahamas, at 9 p.m. Sunday, the sheriff's office said. A
total of 27 men and 5 women were taken by Border Patrol late Monday
to the Krome Detention Center near Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Addison Hepburn, 44, the Bahamian boat captain who investigators
believe smuggled some of the immigrants on a 23-foot outboard was
arrested from that boat about 1 mile south of the inlet and 50
yards offshore shortly before 7:30 a.m. He was charged by Border
Patrol with smuggling illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to federal smuggling charges, Hepburn may be charged
with murder for Dorsonne's death, the sheriff's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsonne's death is the fifth time in 10 years that an immigrant
has drowned during a smuggling attempt on Palm Beach County and
Treasure Coast beaches. In October 1981, 33 Haitian immigrants
drowned after their leaky, wooden sailboat broke up in rough surf
less than a half-mile from the Hillsboro Beach in Broward County.
The 34 others aboard the boat survived.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent drownings were in 1994 when four immigrants
drowned off the Martin County coast after a smuggler known as
Captain Jump Off made the immigrants get out in the ocean.
Officials have been looking for that captain, Richard B. Barker, of
West Palm Beach. A federal arrest warrant was issued for his arrest
on Feb. 20, but he disappeared. The warrant said he violated
probation after serving less than four years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol and sheriff's office were still searching late
Monday for additional boats and smugglers, after Hepburn told
investigators that two boats left the Bahamas Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might have even been a third boat,'' said Keith Roberts,
the U.S. Border Patrol's assistant chief in South Florida. ``We're
still investigating to knit this entire smuggling conspiracy
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsonne's father, who has a green card and lives in Palm Beach
County, and Myrtha Camille's husband, who is seeking political
asylum here, knew of the overnight smuggling attempt. Camille was
taken briefly to Jupiter Medical Center early Monday when rescuers
thought she was pregnant. Her condition was unknown late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard raft arrived an hour after the initial report to
Jupiter police. But the officer in charge decided not to attempt a
rescue of the 13 immigrants still stranded in heavy surf on the
sandbar. The raft was too unstable and he feared the 13 might try
to avoid rescue and go into deeper water, said Roberts, the Coast
Guard spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boat driver felt he'd better wait for the larger sheriff's
boat and get them all in one fell swoop,'' he said. ``Haitians have
a tendency to scramble in a situation like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13 were all rescued from the sandbar at 6:55 a.m., while two
dozen police officers on shore continued searching the shoreline. A
fisherman, Harold Hutchinson of Tequesta, led a sheriff's
lieutenant to three male immigrants hiding among seagrapes shortly
before 7 a.m.

ADVERTISING: COSMO'S EDITOR MOVES TO GLAMOUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ruth Whitney, who made her multifaceted vision of
young women the trademark of Glamour magazine for more than three
decades, is retiring as its editor. S.I. Newhouse Jr., chairman of
Advance Publications, has recruited Bonnie Fuller, editor of its
archrival, Cosmopolitan, to succeed her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whitney's departure, coming just 18 months after Helen
Gurley Brown, for three decades the reigning spirit behind the
Cosmo girl, retired from her perch atop Hearst Magazines'
best-known publication, leaves the world of women's magazines shorn
of the two women whose sensibilities defined it for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   But while Ms. Brown's vision of modern women focused on sexual
freedom and relationships, Ms. Whitney, an advertising agency
executive said, tended to look beyond those two factors and provide
more practical advice on everything from work to sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more sex in Cosmo than there is in Glamour,'' said
Roberta Garfinkle, a senior vice president of McCann-Erickson New
York. ``But I think they're both essentially talking to the same
audience, the same young women. They're just talking in different
tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glamour is a little more how-to, hands-on, how to do it,
whether it's dressing or men or our careers,'' she added. ``They're
saying, `This is what you need to do and this is how you need to do
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse's successful attempt to recruit Ms. Fuller to Conde
Nast Publications from the Hearst magazines, where she had made
most of her career, signals a new round of sharp competition
between the two magazines, both aimed at the upscale 18- to
35-year-old woman who likes to shop, relax and relate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fuller, 41, who joined Cosmopolitan as Ms. Brown's heir
apparent two years ago, was approached about a week ago by Newhouse
_ ``in the recent past,'' in his phrase _ as he was having
discussions with Ms. Whitney, 70, about her departure. Ms. Fuller's
arrival at Glamour also marks the second transfer of editorial
power at a high-visibility Conde Nast publication this summer,
coming less than a month after David Remnick replaced Tina Brown at
The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very orderly transition,'' Newhouse said, ``though
in fact, even The New Yorker had an orderly transition. But this
was probably more so. Ruth's been there 31 years. And she said to
me she realized it was time. I don't feel that this was an event
that came out of nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   If the New Yorker whirlwind was the focus of comment in the
worlds of literature and journalism, advertisers were the ones
paying the closest attention to the shift in these ad-rich women's
publications. Glamour has for years played Avis to the more opulent
and larger-circulation Cosmopolitan's Hertz, but last year, for the
first time ever, the smaller magazine nosed out its perennial rival
in advertising pages.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1997, according to the Publishers Information
Bureau, Cosmopolitan had sold 1,893 ad pages, while Glamour had
sold 1,940. Through the second quarter of 1998, according to the
bureau, Cosmopolitan has sold 1,099 ad pages; Glamour, 1,078.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things Bonnie has done with Cosmo,'' said Ms.
Garfinkle of McCann-Erickson, ``is that, because there's more
beauty and fashion editorial pages, there's more beauty and fashion
advertising now.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, there is no clear category of advertising _ like
beauty products or fashion _ that is likely to follow Ms. Fuller
and leave Cosmopolitan behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's a category that Glamour has and now
Cosmo won't get,'' Ms. Garfinkle said. ``They are very head-to-head
on the advertising side.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathleen Black, the president of Hearst Magazines, who learned
of Ms. Fuller's impending departure at a meeting last Thursday,
announced on Monday that Kate White, the editor of Redbook, would
succeed Ms. Fuller as editor of Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have loved Bonnie to stay at Cosmo because she was
very successful,'' Ms. Black said on Monday. ``But I'm thrilled
Kate is here. Plus I think Bonnie's nuts _ why would anyone leave
the largest young women's magazine in the world to go to Glamour?''
</P>
<P>
   Cosmopolitan's current circulation is 2.7 million, according to
its publisher, Donna Kalajan. Glamour, the largest of Conde Nast's
17 magazines in both advertising and readership, has a circulation
of 2.3 million, said a Conde Nast spokeswoman, Maurie Perl.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse, chairman of Conde Nast's parent, Advance Publications,
offered a farewell paean to Ms. Whitney on Monday, saying: ``I was
present at the creation 31 years ago when Ruth came into our lives,
and she is a consummately dedicated capable and quite brilliant
editor. She's all business, totally committed to her magazine. She
also played an important part in the whole change in women's roles
since 1967. I think she's a remarkable editor.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he wanted in her successor, he said: ``It's not a
question that is part of my thinking. I don't look for something as
a finite thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Fuller, following Ms. Whitney at Glamour had some
parallels with following Ms. Brown at Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you inherit a successful magazine, your biggest fear is
that your going to muck it up,'' she said. ``The challenge is to
build on the strengths, to invigorate and energize and not lose the
reader who likes so many things in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White, 46, said she had once been sent to interview Ms.
Brown by her editor at GQ, Art Cooper, who sent her off saying,
``Kate, I can see you as the editor of Cosmo.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Sunday, when Ms. Black called her into the city from her
country home in Bucks County, Pa., to offer her the job, Ms. White
has been mapping her strategy for a magazine that has twice as much
editorial space as Redbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just plan to get in there and run with the formula,'' Ms.
White said. ``I just did a book called `Nine Secrets of Women Who
Get Everything They Want.' Two of the chapters were called `Bite
off more than you can chew' and `Wear your heart on your sleeve.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to make every issue fresh and exciting.''

   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ Jean-Renold Camille of Boynton Beach, Fla.
hasn't seen his wife in almost six years; not since he came to
Florida from Haiti in 1992 seeking political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he got a phone call from the small town in Haiti he
comes from. Myrtha, his wife, told him she was going to sail to
Florida Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her not to do it,'' said Camille, 42, a prep cook in
suburban Boca Raton. ``It is crazy, so dangerous. But someone gets
in their mind to come to America, and no one can say no.''
</P>
<P>
   Myrtha Camille, one of 33 Haitian refugees forced onto a sandbar
before dawn Monday near Florida's Jupiter Inlet, was hospitalized
after officials found the group. Jean-Renold Camille said he was
waiting to be granted political asylum so his wife could legally
join him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She swallowed so much water. ... They have still not let me
see her,'' Camille said late Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Camille and Joseph Dorsonne _ whose daughter, Benette, 25,
drowned while trying to make it to shore _ were at the Haitian
American Community Council in Delray Monday seeking help from
council President Daniella Henry. They also talked with a Palm
Beach County sheriff's detective at the council's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter, Benette,'' Dorsonne sobbed in Henry's office.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsonne, 56, has lived in Delray Beach since 1980. He last saw
Benette in July, he said, when he visited Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her mother does not even know yet,'' Dorsonne said. ``She is
at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is crazy to do this in a boat. You get caught, or the boat
is not good, and it crashes,'' Dorsonne said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsonne said he received a call from Benette on Sunday and
urged his daughter not to attempt the trip. He said he applied in
1990 for her legal passage to the United States, but she didn't
want to wait anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the political situation, everyone wants to leave,''
Camille said. ``But then this is what happens.''

MARKET PLACE: GOLDMAN PARTNERS VOTE TO SELL SHARES TO PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GOLDMAN-RUBIN) 
(af) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. partners voted overwhelming
Monday to sell shares in Wall Street's most profitable private
investment bank, formally approving an offering plan that values
the firm at $28 billion and promises employees a big cut of the
riches.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was expected after the decision in principle in June to
take Goldman public. But it showed that some of the investment
world's savviest underwriters remain confident that the stock
market will stay strong enough through the fall to reward Goldman's
owners with the lofty premium they expect for their shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Full steam ahead,'' one Goldman partner said after the firm's
early morning balloting, adding that his colleagues were not
unnerved by the recent sharp drop in stock prices. ``It's the right
thing to do at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   The offering, scheduled for late October, will give Goldman
stock, a tool it has lacked during the furious round of mergers and
acquisitions among its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Salomon
Smith Barney have all used their stock to expand at home and abroad
and lure top banking talent. Goldman is now expected to join the
fray, though its leaders insist they will stick to their core
mission of providing investment banking services to blue-chip
companies, governments and wealthy private clients.
</P>
<P>
   Though Goldman partners rejected the idea of selling shares half
a dozen times in recent years, fearing public ownership would
dilute its culture, they are solidly behind the plan to sell shares
this time. One reason is the historically unprecedented prices the
public is willing to pay for the best financial companies, a
premium that will make Goldman's initial public offering one of the
richest ever.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the Goldman offering plan will not be made public
until late this month or early next month when the firm registers
with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue shares.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldman partners familiar with the plan approved Monday said
the firm anticipates selling 10 percent to 15 percent of its shares
to the public, raising about $3 billion. The offering will price
the whole firm at $28 billion, possibly a little more or less
depending on stock market trends between now and October.
</P>
<P>
   That is slightly below the high end of the range anticipated
earlier in the summer, reflecting a cooling in the share prices of
other big investment banks since that time. But it would still
represent a much larger premium _ about 3.5 times book value _ than
Morgan or Merrill received when they went public, in 1986 and 1971,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a pledge to share the wealth, the partners will set
aside $5 billion to $6 billion worth of Goldman shares for the
11,300 employees below the level of partner, Goldman executives
familiar with the plan said.
</P>
<P>
   The shares will be granted immediately but cannot be sold for
three to five years, a way of tying employees to the firm after the
public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that compensation pool would be distributed according to
an automatic formula that applies to every full-time Goldman
employee worldwide, maid to managing director. Every worker will
get shares equivalent to half of their total compensation this
year, plus a bonus for each year the person has worked at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Partners will dole out the rest of the compensation pool to
senior and mid-range employees based on their performances, like a
bonus fund. Some of the 211 managing directors who have yet to make
partner, especially those who have produced big revenues for the
firm, could receive up to $15 million. Many others would receive
much smaller bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman has also agreed to pay a premium to its outside
investors, including limited or retired Goldman partners who keep
money in the firm and several passive investors, including Sumitomo
Bank in Japan and Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman has offered limited partners a return of between 25
percent and 55 percent on their investment, depending on whether
they want cash or stock.
</P>
<P>
   The 189 general partners, Goldman's sole legal owners, will get
the remaining shares for themselves. That will give them a new
collective net worth of $15 billion to $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The junior-most partners, those given the title as recently as
1996, would receive at least $40 million in shares. The
senior-most, including Jon S. Corzine and Henry M. Paulson Jr., the
firm's co-chairmen and chief executives, and Roy J. Zuckerberg,
Goldman's longest-serving partner, would receive up to $200
million, people familiar with the plans said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman has already begun to think like a public company, using
stock as a lure for new hires. The hope is that the firm will add
to its roster of talented bankers as it prepares to market itself
to the investing public.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that Goldman is offering some prospective
recruits multiyear packages worth $10 million to $25 million in
cash and stock. In the past, Goldman has not offered new hires that
kind of money, in large part because it would have come directly
out of the partners' own capital.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman recently hired Michael Carr, co-head of mergers and
acquisitions at Salomon Smith Barney. Carr is a specialist in
industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldman failed to attract another Salomon star, the
telecommunications analyst Jack Grubman. Grubman turned down an
offer this weekend after Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of
Salomon's parent, Travelers Group, made a personal pitch to keep
him.

HALL OF FAME JOINS PAST AND PRESENT  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Ansel Williamson, the onetime slave who
trained the first winner of the Kentucky Derby in 1875, was
inducted into the thoroughbred Hall of Fame on Monday as a legend
of racing's past. He was joined by 45-year-old Bill Mott, who
saddled Cigar and is a legend of the present, the youngest trainer
ever enshrined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came awfully early in life,'' Mott said, sounding a bit
awed. ``It was never planned; it was never expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Racing put its best foot forward for its 43rd annual ceremony,
which attracted a standing-room crowd of 1,200 under a tent pitched
on a field next to the National Museum of Racing across Union
Avenue from the Saratoga Race Course, which is booming in its 130th
year. Dozens of famous trainers and jockeys of the past sat
together as footnotes to history, applauding the six racing figures
being honored.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Williamson and Mott, they were Jacinto Vasquez, the
jockey who rode 5,231 winners, won the Kentucky Derby twice and won
268 stakes races, and three celebrated horses: Riva Ridge, the
stablemate of Secretariat and the juvenile champion of 1971, who
went on to win the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes in 1972;
Bayakoa, the Argentine filly, who became a double champion in the
United States by winning 16 of her 21 starts in 1989 and 1990, and
Fort Marcy, three times a champion on grass and Horse of the Year
for his exploits in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   They brought the Hall of Fame roster to 77 jockeys, 71 trainers
and 154 horses. But few have been honored as early as Bill Mott, a
veterinarian's son from South Dakota, who started cleaning out
stalls at the age of 14 for $50 a week and had become a superstar
by the time he turned 40. By the close of last year, he had
achieved these towering numbers: 10,750 races started, 2,330
winners for a 22 percent success rate and purse money of $80
million.
</P>
<P>
   He ranks on the top rung of trainers with D. Wayne Lukas, the
runaway leader on most charts, who chafes because the rules say a
trainer must be licensed for 25 years to be considered for the Hall
of Fame. Lukas contends he has been a trainer far longer. He is
supported by Mott, who says: ``Nobody deserves to be in the Hall of
Fame more than Wayne. He changed the face of racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mott was presented for his induction by an old boss and mentor,
Jack Van Berg, a Hall of Fame trainer himself, who flew in from the
West Coast and said, ``I wouldn't have missed this if I had had to
walk from California.''
</P>
<P>
   Mott gained fame after he switched Cigar from grass to dirt and
then saw his star win 16 straight races. He also trained the
champions Theatrical, Paradise Creek and Ajina, and he saddled the
1997 Horse of the Year, Favorite Trick, here on Sunday for the Jim
Dandy Stakes, which the colt won by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am honored and humbled,'' Mott said. ``I've been blessed by
the number of friends I've had and by the support of my family.
I've had assistants who have been with me for more than a decade.
I've received some year-end awards. But this one is for a career.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of age, he surpassed the record set by Allen Jerkens,
who was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1975 when he was 46.
</P>
<P>
   But if the election of Mott marked a triumph for the present,
the recognition belatedly accorded Williamson marked a triumph for
history.
</P>
<P>
   He was born a slave around 1806 in Virginia, and his days as a
horse trainer have been traced to the 1850's. He had significant
victories in New Orleans, Charleston, Atlanta and Mobile, and then
won the Jersey Derby with Norfolk, the Travers with Tom Bowling and
the inaugural Kentucky Derby with Aristides. He died in 1881,
leaving no descendants but many major successes.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez came to this country in 1960 from Panama and, when he
retired two years ago, stood 15th ion the career list in winners.
He won the Kentucky Derby in 1976 with Foolish Pleasure and in 1980
with the filly Genuine Risk. He elected to ride the undefeated
filly Ruffian in her ill-fated match race with Foolish Pleasure,
and his presenter was Frank Whiteley, the Hall of Fame trainer of
Ruffian, who said, ``You've been deserving of this for a long
time.''

 &HT;    Schumacher wants chance to double
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLOVIS, Calif. _ Brad Schumacher has the singular goal of double
dipping in the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   After this week's U.S. Swimming National Championships, he'll
know if he's heading in the right direction or just treading water.
</P>
<P>
   Because Schumacher has all but been named to the U.S. water polo
team, ''More and more,'' he said, ''it looks like it's going to be
a matter of me making the swim team'' to reach his two-sport
objective.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Schumacher won two freestyle relay gold medals at
the 1996 Atlanta Games won't hold water when he arrives at the 2000
Trials. And if he makes the U.S. team, he wants a clear shot at his
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher had to appeal to a U.S. swimming board of review for
permission to compete in both sports at the 1999 World
Championships, where he became the first athlete to win gold in
each. Swimming national team director Dennis Pursley originally
denied the bid because he thought Schumacher would set a bad
precedent by missing a few days of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher, 24, of Bowie, Md., will soon send a letter to U.S.
Swimming spelling out his intentions, ''because there's no reason
for them not to let me do it,'' he said. ''It doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   At the World Championships, the sports overlapped; at the
Olympics, swimming will be the first week and water polo the
second.

U.N. REPORTS LITTLE HELP IN MONITORING BALKAN ARMS BAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Five months after the Security Council imposed
an arms embargo to quell the fighting in Kosovo, no international
organization has volunteered to do intensive monitoring of the ban,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan told council members on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community risks once again being placed in a
position,'' he said, ``where it is only dealing with the symptoms
of a conflict through its humanitarian agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council begins debate on Tuesday on a resolution
aimed at stopping the fighting, an issue that the ``contact group''
of nations most closely involved in negotiations has largely kept
out of the council.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general was head of the U.N. peacekeeping
department several years ago when the Security Council passed an
ambitious resolution on Bosnia but then did not authorize troops to
protect ``safe havens'' or carry out other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   In a report that circulated to council members Monday, Annan
warned of the consequences for the Balkans if ethnic conflict is
not contained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuation or further escalation of this conflict has
dangerous implications for the stability of the region,'' Annan
wrote, referring to Kosovo. ``Given the responsibilities of the
United Nations in the wider region and the ethnic makeup in
neighboring countries, I cannot but express my alarm at this
prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   A Security Council resolution in March called for an end to arms
sales to the former Yugoslavia as Belgrade began stepping up a
campaign against an ethnic Albanian separatist movement in Kosovo.
The resolution asked the secretary general to recommend how an
embargo could be monitored so that arms did not reach either the
Yugoslavs, primarily Serbs, or the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But substantial arms have continued to flow to rebels from
across the Albanian border, and Serbian troops remain well-armed.
</P>
<P>
   Annan told the council soon after that resolution was passed
that the United Nations, already deep in debt to nations that
contribute to its peacekeeping forces, could not afford to monitor
the embargo. He said he would ask for help from European regional
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has told the council that NATO, the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union, the Western
European Union and the Danube Commission all said they would
enforce the ban, but are reluctant to provide the level of support
that is needed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``At this stage,'' Annan wrote in his report, ``the overall
resources pledged by those organizations would not allow for the
establishment of a comprehensive monitoring regime.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Kosovo is of special interest to the current
Security Council president, Danilo Turk of Slovenia, the first
nation that emerged from the breakup of greater Yugoslavia to hold
a council seat.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing for reporters on Friday, Turk, a former professor
of international law, said that the contact group's only success
has been in preventing the Security Council from having a role in
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Slovenian delegation had tried and failed in the past to get
the Security Council to pay more attention to Kosovo, but the
Clinton administration and the Europeans and Russians in the
contact group preferred to work on the issue among themselves and
through their own envoys to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats here wonder whether that will change when Richard
Holbrooke, who has been President Clinton's envoy in talks with
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, moves to the United
Nations as U.S. representative in the fall.

JETS `FABIO' WANTS TO BE MATINEE PLAYER  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The only rookie likely to be a starter among
the 12 players the Jets drafted this year is far from being a
glamorous figure or major collegiate name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Fabio,'' called out teammate Lonnie Palelei Monday, trying
to sound like a teen-ager calling her idol. The object of Palelei's
mock derision was Jason Fabini, 6 feet 7 inches, 310 pounds, and
trying to get stronger.
</P>
<P>
   He is a fourth-rounder out of a downtown school, Cincinnati,
that has little cachet in the National Football League. But this
week Coach Bill Parcells installed Fabini at offensive right tackle
in place of the veteran Siupeli Malamala. But do not read anything
into that, Parcells insists.
</P>
<P>
   Fabini hardly impressed scouts with his athleticism. Indeed, Jet
quarterback Vinny Testaverde, one of the most imposing figures on
the team, can lift 135 pounds more than Fabini.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something that brings out the football smarts in
Fabini. After the Jets' player personnel director, Dick Haley,
watched Fabini in a game last year, Haley came back the next
morning and said: ``I finally saw a football player yesterday.
Forget all the talk about athleticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells described Fabini Monday as ``probably the fourth guy
I've had with similar capabilities.'' He was talking about Jumbo
Elliott and Doug Riesenberg with the Giants and Max Lane with the
Patriots, players who may not have looked good but who performed at
a high level. ``Probably the fact I didn't do well in the testing
for the draft affected my going in the fourth round,'' Fabini said.
``It had a lot to do with who impresses the scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabini also had to get stronger. He came from a weight-lifting
program that is different from the way the Jets put on muscle. The
premise in the Jets' weight room is to train for powerful bursts,
not necessarily to have the build of an Arnold Schwarzenegger.
</P>
<P>
   Fabini, who has dropped 10 pounds in camp, gets to test his
newly found strength against one of the best pass rushers on
Saturday, when the Jets face the Baltimore Ravens. He will be
matched against Peter Boulware, who recorded 11{ sacks as a rookie
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Jason is that he's been well coached, and it
shows,'' said the Jets' offensive line coach, Bill Muir. ``Some
guys are just able to translate their ability to playing
football.'' Fabini's line coach at Cincinnati was Bob Wylie, who is
now with the Bengals as the tight-ends coach.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Malamala is involved in fewer plays at practice and
will probably see less action than Fabini. Malamala has been in and
out as a starter since his rookie year in 1992 and in recent
seasons has played sporadically because of a knee injury. And as
Parcells pointed out Monday: ``He's not the incumbent. David
Williams was our starter there last year.'' The Jets released
Williams on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Parcells is solicitous of veterans who have played hard,
saying, ``I don't want to beat up Soupy in practice.'' He also has
told Malamala that playing Fabini may not necessarily mean a
change.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, Parcells is impressed by Fabini's intelligence,
observing, ``He didn't make a mental mistake in the game last week,
which is unusual for a rookie.'' Fabini saw significant action in
the exhibition opener last Thursday, a victory over the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Fabini played left tackle at Cincinnati where, he notes, ``we
ran the ball 60 times a game, and the other team knew we were going
to.'' Switching to the right side has not been a problem, he said,
``because I'm right-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And, anyway,'' he added, ``I've been playing football since I
was 8 years old.''

CURTAIN DROPS ON OUTSIZED PRODUCER AND SPENDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (With CANADA-LIVENT)  
(lb) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Garth Drabinsky, the Canadian showman whose
flamboyant rise to prominence on Broadway has apparently come to a
halt, was a man who inspired both admiration and resentment from
his colleagues in the staid business of live theater.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky, ousted Monday as chief creative director of Livent
Inc., the theater company he helped found, was known for
outspending rival producers for actors' salaries, stage sets and
advertising. As a result, he was long the subject of suspicion
among those who could not figure out how he made the numbers add
up.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many of his loudest critics gave him credit
for his accomplishments: the lush and lovely revival of ``Show
Boat,'' which ran for two years at the Gershwin Theater and
recouped its cost, though at $10 million it was very likely the
most expensive musical revival of all time; the construction, on
time and on budget, of the Ford Center for the Performing Arts on
West 42nd Street, a nearly universally praised building that, with
musical theater houses in short supply, Broadway and New York City
needed; and the original musical ``Ragtime,'' which won four Tony
awards and is virtually selling out at the Ford Center eight times
a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admired his passion and commitment to his goal, which was
the production of quality theater that would appeal to and reach
worldwide audiences,'' said John Breglio, an entertainment lawyer
who has had wide dealings with Drabinsky. ``But as an outside
observer, I was confounded by certain business decisions, namely
the production and advertising costs, which seemed to contradict
good economic sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky, 48, is known as a man with expensive tastes,
considerable self-regard and no lack of confidence. The profile of
a man who would spend lavishly, perhaps recklessly, to support and
sell his artistic vision is in sync with Drabinsky's reputation for
arrogance and hubris. And he has been cut down before.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 he founded Cineplex Odeon, the movie-theater concern,
building it over a decade from an 18-screen complex in Toronto to
an 1,800-screen chain throughout the United States and Canada. But
in his expansion plans, which included film production and
distribution and forays into live theater, he ran afoul of MCA, the
partner he had taken on in 1986 to avert bankruptcy. MCA ousted him
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   As severance, he took with him the company's live-entertainment
division, consisting of two assets: the newly renovated Pantages
Theater in Toronto, and the right to present in it the Andrew Lloyd
Webber musical ``The Phantom of the Opera.'' That was the
foundation of Livent.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has once again taken on partners to avert financial
disaster, history has repeated itself and he has again been
dismissed from the company he created.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since Livent was revamped in April, Drabinsky's position has
been widely speculated to be precarious, but Monday's announcement
was nonetheless surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised and I'm sad, because our experience with Livent
under Garth's direction has been excellent,'' said Cora Cahan,
president of the New 42nd Street, a nonprofit development agency,
which is effectively Livent's landlord for the Ford Center and
which signed an agreement with Livent last week to take over the
Times Square Theater, the last empty theater on 42nd Street.
(Livent has proposed to create within the current building a
500-seat house for plays and small musicals, a restaurant and
offices.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have other men who own theaters,'' Ms. Cahan said. ``We
don't have too many with such vivid dreams. It's sad what's
happened to him.''

GIANTS MAY GAMBLE ON PLAN FOR SAFETY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ There is a secret plan afoot for the Giants'
rookie safety, Shaun Williams. But something this simple can't stay
a secret for long.
</P>
<P>
   The plan? Get Williams on the field as much as anyone, even if
it means some very unconventional alignments _ such as a
one-linebacker set that puts all four of the Giants' talented
safeties on the field at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound needlessly risky, and it is a concept still
confined to training camp, but the Giants' defense has been
elevated to an elite status by defying convention.
</P>
<P>
   Jessie Armstead was supposed to be too small to play weakside
linebacker. He made the Pro Bowl last year.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Scott Galyon was supposed to be too much like
Armstead to be useful. Galyon was in 350 plays from scrimmage as a
nickel linebacker last season and dominated. Jason Sehorn was
supposed to be too big for cornerback. He is now considered among
the top five at his position.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is a hybrid player _ with the size and instincts of a
safety and the skills of a cornerback. That is the kind of
combination that tantalizes coaches who spend hours in darkened
film rooms searching for ways to confuse the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Why not then create a hybrid defense suited to the skills of a
unique player?
</P>
<P>
   The blueprint has been drawn, but the implementation may take
several weeks. Williams, the team's first-round draft pick out of
UCLA, is still learning the basics of strong safety, where he is
the backup to Sam Garnes. Williams is also still learning the
one-on-one skills he will need to become the nickel defender
assigned to the slot receiver in obvious passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   Tutelage in those disciplines occupies his time for now. And
there are his special teams duties, which should get Williams on
the field for another 350 to 370 plays this season.
</P>
<P>
   But if Williams can play reliably in the nickel defense with
safeties Percy Ellsworth and Tito Wooten and cornerbacks Sehorn and
Phillippi Sparks, then maybe the Giants can sneak Garnes onto the
field, too. Garnes, powerfully built at 228 pounds and known as a
ferocious hitter, could be disguised as a linebacker. Add Armstead
to that mix and that is a mighty formidable seven behind the front
line.
</P>
<P>
   And what would opposing offenses make of a defense with four
safeties, three of whom are more than capable against the run?
Ellsworth, after all, is 225 pounds and Williams is 216 pounds and
also known as a hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a defense daring you to run or daring you to pass?
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly theory for now, but it's one the Giants coaches have
tinkered with. Anything to get Williams on the field more often.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't ready for the advanced lessons yet, and the Giants
defense is playing well enough that there's no need to rush
Williams' education.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Giants' opponents become more difficult, as the games
with San Francisco, Denver and Green Bay get closer and as the
division opponents prepare to play the Giants a second time, it
will tempting for the Giants' coaching staff to unveil a new,
powerful wrinkle or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, Shaun can do all these things,'' said the Giants'
defensive coordinator, John Fox. ``I'm not worried about that. He's
got those kind of special abilities. But normally, you wouldn't
even think of asking a rookie to learn so much. But he can handle
that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you watch him develop and you see a confidence in him that
comes from being successful. And you dream about the other things
that might be possible. But there are other players who deserve
expanded roles, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's problem is that Marcus Buckley, the new strongside
linebacker, is good in pass coverage. So is Galyon, who had another
strong game Saturday against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams did not hurt his case on Saturday, either. He made
mistakes but opened eyes, too. He forced a fumble with a jarring
hit at the line of scrimmage, and he held his own when facing
receivers one on one. Most of all, he played a lot, virtually every
play of the second half that didn't involve the team's offense.
</P>
<P>
   That may have been the future on display for the Giants' defense
Saturday night. Shaun Williams played safety. Shaun Williams played
like a cornerback. Shaun Williams played on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Some secret.

JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN MCDOUGAL EMBEZZELMENT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: clarifications in 7th paragraph, saying Bill Clinton was
governor at the time of loan, not president.)  (ll) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After years of delays and legal wrangling, jury
selection began on Monday in Susan McDougal's embezzlement trial in
Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal, who spent nearly two years in jail for refusing
to answer questions from the Whitewater independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, faces up to seven more years behind bars if
convicted in her latest battle with the law.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Monica, she stands accused of bilking conductor Zubin
Mehta and his wife, Nancy, out of more than $150,000 when Mrs.
McDougal was their personal assistant and bookkeeper from 1989 to
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to start the trial but I'm hurting a little bit
today,'' she told The Associated Press, referring to the back
problems that prompted a federal judge to release her from a
California prison in June and send her to her parents' home in
Camden, Ark., as part of a 90-day home-detention sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal, 43, wore a back brace under her dress at the
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   When she was released, Mrs. McDougal was three and a half months
into a two-year sentence for taking part in a fraudulent scheme to
obtain a $300,000 loan in 1986 that was paid to a company she
created called Master Marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the proceeds went to pay the debts of the Whitewater
Development Co., in which she and her husband, James McDougal, were
partnersin Arkansas with Gov. Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton. Mrs. McDougal and her husband were separated in 1984 and
divorced in 1990. He died in prison in March of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal's current legal problems have nothing to do with
her defiant role in the Whitewater investigation. Los Angeles
County Superior Court Judge Leslie Light told the dozens of
potential jurors on Monday to disregard ``anything and everything''
they may have heard about Mrs. McDougal from that case.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Monica charges were filed against her five years ago
and ``we have basically been waiting since then,'' said Sandi
Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County District
Attorney's office. ``We did agree to allow her other prosecution
back East to be completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal is facing 12 counts of embezzlement and fraud in a
case that is built around the Mehtas' financial records.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal, who lived in one of the Mehta family's five homes
and traveled throughout the United States and abroad for Mehta's
concerts, is, among other offenses, accused of forging Mrs. Mehta's
name on a credit card application and fraudulently charging more
than $90,000 of personal items, including expensive clothes and
hotel stays.
</P>
<P>
   She is also accused of charging thousands of dollars of personal
air travel and of bilking the couple out of $65,000 in falsely
claimed expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The court has imposed an order that neither side can discuss the
evidence of the case outside the courtroom, but in a previous
interview, Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, said the Mehta
case would have been dropped long ago if the defendant were not a
prominent figure in the Whitewater investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Geragos said Starr's prosecution team had used the California
charges as a ``club'' to force Mrs. McDougal to cooperate, an
accusation Starr's team denies. The local prosecutor, Jeffrey
Semow, has also denied any connection between the two matters.
</P>
<P>
   The delays are not over yet.
</P>
<P>
   After the jury is selected, Ms. Gibbons said, the trial will
take a two-week hiatus so the defense and prosecutors can review
thousands of pages of recently released Internal Revenue Service
documents.

CLINTON VOWS TO VETO GOP PLAN, URGES `PATIENT BILL OF RIGHTS' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ President Clinton vowed Monday to veto
Republican legislation that would provide some protections for
patients in managed health care plans, saying it fails to offer key
safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left the sex scandal swirl of Washington to attend a
series of fund-raising events for Democrats in Kentucky, Illinois
and California. He will return Wednesday, a day earlier than
planned so he can meet with national security advisers following
the embassy bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The president later raised $400,000 for candidates in Kentucky
and flew to Chicago where he raised $1 million for the Democratic
Party. Clinton on Tuesday will raise $3 million at three events in
California for Gray Davis, the Democratic candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of protesters greeted Clinton at the Commonwealth
Convention Center here, holding signs aimed at the Monica Lewinsky
investigation. ``Proof is on the dress; now you must confess,''
read one, referring to Lewinsky's dress that may contain DNA
stains.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, ignoring the demonstrators, stepped up pressure on
Congress to pass a ``patient bill of rights'' in September before
members adjourn. The House recently passed its version and the
Senate is considering another alternative.
</P>
<P>
   But the president said the Republican plans would give patients
a ``false sense of security'' that they were protected from the
excesses of health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a bill of rights, not a bill of goods. We need a law,
not another loophole. If I get that other bill of right, I will be
forced to veto it, and I will,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said a ``real patient bill of rights'' would strengthen
privacy protection for patients while the Republican version would
increase the number of people who can see patient records.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Democratic version would guarantee patients the
right to see specialists while the Republican alternative would
not. The Democratic version would guarantee patients in the middle
of major medical treatment the right to keep their doctor and would
bar incentives offered by HMOs for doctors to limit medical care.
The GOP plan would not, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic plan would guarantee patients the right to
emergency room care and allow patients to file lawsuits against
HMOs, which currently are protected from such claims.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Democratic plan would apply to all
employer-paid health plans but the the Republican plan would exempt
the 100 million workers for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The president said managed care plans have done some good things
in controlling costs. He noted that in the 1980s, health care costs
increased at three times the rate of inflation, a level that could
not be sustained. He noted that since 1990 the number of people in
HMOs has nearly doubled to 160 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said some plans have gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, when the bottom line is more important than patients'
lives, when families have nowhere to turn, when their loved ones
are harmed by bad decisions, when specialist care is denied, when
emergency care is not covered, we have to act,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted an ``overwhelming grass-roots consensus'' has developed
about the need for a patient bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Republican leadership balked for nine months
before taking any action.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have listened to those with an interest in preserving the
status quo rather than the clear call of the public interest,'' he
said. Republicans, he charged, have made the patient bill of rights
a partisan issue.

<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Significant contrasts are part of the
adaptation process for Summit Chase head professional Stephen
Keppler at the 80th PGA Championship this week. The road from
Snellville, Ga. to Sahalee was long and particularly winding.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Keppler, 37, the four-time Georgia PGA player of the
year, longed for a few preflight glimpses of Sahalee Country Club,
but had no time to watch the PGA preview show on CBS Sunday. It
conflicted with Summit Chase's member-guest tournament, a summer
highlight for Stephen and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   So much for research opportunities. Armed with a few details
from the weekly golf periodicals, Keppler was on site at the
tree-lined venue Monday, striking balls on the Sahalee practice
range between Colin Montgomerie and Davis Love III.
</P>
<P>
   Do not be misled, however. While Keppler might be a tad rusty,
he's more comfortable with the surroundings than many of the 25
club pros in the 150-player field. For those unfamiliar with the
English-born Keppler, he nearly won the BellSouth Classic in 1995,
finishing third and earning $88,400 after sharing the 54-hole lead.
He played in the PGA at Riviera three months later, missing the
cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riviera was slightly different in '95 because I had gotten
some attention at the BellSouth Classic,'' Keppler said. ``It made
it a lot easier to play at Riviera. This year I'm just more like
one of the club pros.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a turbulent year for the Keppler family. For several
months Stephen Keppler's golf game fell dramatically down the
priority list, and for good reason. Daughter Jordan, 4, in January
required removal of a kidney that had been diseased by a
grapefruit-sized tumor. Precautionary chemotherapy followed for
Jordan, bringing months of anguish for Stephen and wife Karen.
Jordan is fine now, with no evidence of the illness. She was at the
airport Monday, kissing her Daddy goodbye and wishing him good luck
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of puts everything in perspective,'' Keppler said.
</P>
<P>
   Handling whatever pressure ensues this week should not be a
problem for Keppler, considering how he got here. At the PGA's Club
Pro Championship at Pinehurst in June, he chipped in on the 72nd
hole from 30 feet to tie four other players and grab the last spots
for Sahalee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I play decently, I'll feel comfortable this week,'' Keppler
said. ``The guys out here have always been real friendly to me. I
don't really feel any pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   That might come later. If Keppler were to make the cut at
Sahalee, he still wants to play in the Nestle Chilled Beverage
Georgia Open at Jekyll Island on next Monday through Thursday. It
would demand a red-eye flight to Atlanta Sunday night and a
connection to Brunswick, Ga., with sleep optional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should be able to make it,'' he said calmly. ``They gave me
a late tee time.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes:
</P>
<P>
   A flood of withdrawals have given Atlanta's Billy Andrade, the
ninth alternate, a breath of hope to make the field. Among those
out of the field are Germany's Bernhard Langer (neck) and Michael
Bradley (back), Bruce Lietzke (back) and Mark McNulty (elbow).
Added to the field were Jim Carter, Clark Dennis, Robert Damron,
Neal Lancaster, Mark Wiebe and Rocco Mediate, the seventh
alternate.

PRESIDENT'S LAWYER WILL VIEW DEPOSITION IN PAULA JONES SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge in Little Rock granted permission
Monday to President Clinton's private lawyer to view the
president's videotaped deposition in the Paula Jones sexual
misconduct case, as he prepares to testify before cameras once
again, this time about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came a day before one of the president's most
valued image-makers, Harry Thomason, is expected to appear here
before the grand jury investigating the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, David Kendall, already had access to a printed
version of the deposition. But he asked in a sealed motion last
Thursday to view the videotape before Aug. 17. On that day, the
president is scheduled to testify at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's testimony is to be shown live on closed-circuit
television to a grand jury, and there has been speculation inside
and outside the White House about whether the manner in which it is
shot could affect jurors' views. Will Clinton be shown in close up?
Will the prosecutors also be seen? Who will control the camera?
</P>
<P>
   The Little Rock judge, Susan Webber Wright, dismissed the Jones
case on April 1. She ruled Monday that Kendall could view the
videotape under the supervision of Judge Norma Holloway Johnson,
who is overseeing the grand jury in the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Judge Wright said that Kendall could not copy the tape, and
that he was bound by the confidentiality order muzzling others who
have access to it.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wright rejected several conditions sought by Mrs. Jones,
including that she have a lawyer present for the viewing. Under an
agreement between the two sides in the suit, the judge has custody
in her vault of at least two copies of the videotape, one of which
is considered Clinton's and one Mrs. Jones'. The judge is holding
them to prevent their use for ``any improper purpose,'' her
decision Monday said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomason, the Hollywood television producer who has staged some
of Clinton's most important appearances, will appear on Tuesday
before the grand jury, an administration official said. With his
wife, Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, Thomason rushed to the president's
side after the accusations emerged in January that Clinton had lied
about an affair with Ms. Lewinsky and tried to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Thomason, an Arkansan who is a close friend of the Clintons, was
quoted in the July 6 issue of The New Yorker magazine as saying
that in January he urged Clinton to issue a forceful denial of the
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did so on Jan. 26. ``I did not have sexual relations
with that woman, Miss Lewinsky,'' Clinton declared, shaking a
finger. ``I never told anybody to lie, not a single time _ never.
These allegations are false. And I need to go back to work for the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has avoided describing the relationship since then.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office declined to comment Monday, and Thomason did not
return a telephone message left at his office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has been interviewing friends and advisers of Clinton to
learn what he may have confided to them about Ms. Lewinsky.
Thomason was quoted in the magazine as saying that after he arrived
at the White House in January, ``We stayed up half the night
talking.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he emerged from that conversation ``positive that
nothing happened between him and Monica.''

<P>
   Comedy Central, whose biggest star, Craig Kilborn, is being
lured away by CBS, is announcing Tuesday that it will replace him
with someone CBS had once coveted: Jon Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central had announced its intention of blocking the move
by Kilborn, host of ``The Daily Show,'' to CBS as long as it could.
It is expected to disclose its decision Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who had his own late-night syndicated show in 1994, was
also for a time under contract with Worldwide Pants, the production
comedy owned by David Letterman, the host of CBS' late-night show.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was expected to become host of whatever show CBS decided
to run after Letterman's ``Late Show'' upon the retirement of Tom
Snyder, who is host of ``The Late Late Show.'' But that contract
had already lapsed by the time Snyder announced his forthcoming
retirement late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart is expected to take over ``The Daily Show'' sometime
this year. ``The Daily Show'' is a half-hour nightly comedy takeoff
on the news. It has become one of the highest-rated regular
programs on Comedy Central, which is owned by Time Warner and
Viacom.

GLOBE, BARNICLE TALK AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The status of Boston Globe columnist Mike Barnicle
remained unresolved after a one-hour meeting Monday between Globe
publisher Benjamin B. Taylor, Globe editor Matthew V. Storin, and
the columnist.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Monday evening, Taylor said, ``This is
is a decision that can not and will not be rushed. It involves the
integrity and character of the Globe and the career of an employee
who has served this paper well for 25 years. The decision we make
must be deliberate, thoughtful, and carefully considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Storin, returning from vacation Monday, added that the meeting
was held because ``I had thought it was important to hear him out
in person.'' Barnicle was not available for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle became embroiled in controversy after an Aug. 2 column
was found to contain eight jokes that closely resembled ones in
comedian George Carlin's book ``BrainDroppings.'' Storin requested
his resignation last Wednesday night after WCVB-TV (Channel 5)
aired a video clip from a June 22 edition of ``Chronicle'' in which
Barnicle endorsed the book, which he earlier had told his editors
he had not read.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle, 54, has maintained that he would not resign, but has
declined to comment on his status in recent days. He has also
stated that he received the Carlin jokes from two friends and that
that he did not read ``BrainDroppings'' before he recommended it on
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Monday if Taylor's statement that the Barnicle
decision ``will not be rushed,'' represented a reconsideration of
the resignation request, Globe spokesman Richard P. Gulla said,
``Nothing has changed. We're affording Mike the confidentiality
that we would afford any other longtime employee. We're not going
into the details of what's going on.'' The Globe statement did
indicate a decision on Barnicle would be announced soon.
</P>
<P>
   Gulla also said that as of Monday at 1 p.m., 287 Globe readers
had canceled their subscriptions in displeasure with the paper's
handling of the Barnicle situation. He said that no advertisers had
threatened a Globe boycott over Barnicle since Staples chairman
Thomas G. Stemberg sent a letter to Taylor on Friday hinting at
that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   And while calls and e-mails on the controversy continued to
arrive at the Globe Monday, the pace slackened noticeably.
</P>
<P>
   As of 4 p.m., the Globe ombudsman's office had received about
100 e-mails and calls on the subject, with the responses running
about 70 percent to 30 percent in favor of Barnicle. As of Monday
evening, the Globe's city desk had received 225 telephone calls,
with readers favoring the retention of Barnicle by about a 2-1
margin.

<P>
   Comedy Central, whose biggest star, Craig Kilborn, is being
lured away by CBS, is announcing Tuesday that it will replace him
with someone CBS had once coveted: Jon Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central had announced its intention of blocking the move
by Kilborn, host of ``The Daily Show,'' to CBS as long as it could.
It is expected to disclose its decision Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who had his own late-night syndicated show in 1994, was
also for a time under contract with Worldwide Pants, the production
comedy owned by David Letterman, the host of CBS' late-night show.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was expected to become host of whatever show CBS decided
to run after Letterman's ``Late Show'' upon the retirement of Tom
Snyder, who is host of ``The Late Late Show.'' But that contract
had already lapsed by the time Snyder announced his forthcoming
retirement late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart is expected to take over ``The Daily Show'' sometime
this year. ``The Daily Show'' is a half-hour nightly comedy takeoff
on the news. It has become one of the highest-rated regular
programs on Comedy Central, which is owned by Time Warner and
Viacom.

RUBIN LIKELY TO MISS BIG WINDFALL FROM OLD FIRM
</HEADLINE>
   (See also GOLDMAN-MARKETPLACE) 
(ll) 
 BY PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Rubin, before joining the Clinton
administration, built his career at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., trading
stakes in companies as head of that Wall Street firm's arbitrage
desk.
</P>
<P>
   So it comes as something of a surprise that Rubin, now treasury
secretary, may have missed out on what would probably have created
the biggest windfall of his life: the planned sale this autumn of a
slice of Goldman, Sachs, which is expected to put a value of about
$28 billion on Wall Street's last big investment banking
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Until he left in late 1992 to join the government, Rubin held
one of the very largest ownership stakes in Goldman, where he
worked for 26 years. Just at book value, Rubin's stake was worth an
estimated $100 million in 1992. Allowing for the healthy
appreciation he would have enjoyed then, and the opportunity this
fall to sell his stake at as much as three times book value, Rubin
may have left the better part of half a billion dollars on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   It might even have been as much as $1.5 billion. Rubin and
Stephen Friedman, co-heads of Goldman from 1990 to 1992, had the
biggest stakes in the Goldman partnership in the early 1990's, when
the firm's top officers still could hold as much as 5 percent of
the partnership, according to people at Goldman. (Since those days,
the leaders' stakes have been whittled down some by the need to
spread ownership more widely in the firm.) Still, a 5 percent stake
in a partnership that is expected to be valued at $28 billion,
would have brought $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Smith, a Treasury Department spokeswoman, said on
Monday that Rubin would not comment in reply to questions about his
missing out on the Goldman sale.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the decision by Rubin to quit Goldman has brought
other rewards, and friends say he is very wealthy from his many
years on Wall Street. Joining the Clinton White House in January
1993, Rubin was appointed treasury secretary in December 1994. At
the Treasury Department, Rubin has won bipartisan plaudits for his
handling of the reduction of the budget deficit and for many of the
other difficult economic issues he has touched. Even so, some of
Rubin's charisma has derived from his enviable status as one of the
capital's richest men, thanks to his years at Goldman. As Treasury
Secretary, Rubin is paid an annual salary of $99,500.
</P>
<P>
   But some who have toiled in government will actually benefit
from the planned Goldman sale. The road that Rubin traveled from
Goldman to government is a two-way street. Such senior government
officials as Gerald Corrigan, former president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York; Peter Sutherland, former commissioner of
the European Community and former head of the General Agreement on
Trade and Tariffs, and Thomas Healey, the assistant secretary for
domestic finance at the Treasury Department in the first Reagan
administration, have all left government in recent years to join
Goldman and become partners.
</P>
<P>
   Former partners of Goldman generally ``go limited,'' meaning
they become limited partners and maintain a stake in the firm that
is paid out over several years. They also earn some interest on
their stake during those years.
</P>
<P>
   But because of concerns about potential conflicts of interest
with his role in government, Rubin resigned his partnership and
sold it back to Goldman before joining the administration as
chairman of National Economic Council in January 1993. Even though
Rubin is being paid out by Goldman over several years, he cannot
benefit from Goldman's successes under the agreement he struck with
his former firm.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith said Rubin ``has no economic stake in Goldman's
success or failure.'' Unlike Friedman and other limited partners,
he is not listed in the firm's directory. The money that Goldman
pays to Rubin goes into a blind trust that holds the rest of his
investments, she added.

 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, Maine _ Hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of
forest _ a swath that is about 5 percent of the land in Maine _ is
for sale in the northern part of the state, prompting a debate over
the future of the heavily logged yet alluring woods.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation groups have called for selling the land to the
public to restore it to its original wilderness. Many residents
here are more comfortable with the status quo of much of the
century: industrial logging of the land by timber companies that
give the public free access for hunting, fishing, boating,
snowmobiling and other sport. But people in both camps worry that
some land _ only a six-hour drive from Boston and featuring miles
of undeveloped lake shores _ will be developed, profitably but
irretrievably, for more tourism, recreation and country houses.
</P>
<P>
   As paper companies liquidate their land holdings in the
Northeast to raise money for their mills, millions of timbered
acres from northern Maine to the Adirondacks of New York are either
for sale or being considered for sale, making their availability
one of the latest conservation issues in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the northern forest region, three and a half million
acres of incredibly valuable land are for sale by willing
sellers,'' said Andrea Colnes, executive director of the Northern
Forest Alliance, a coalition of environmental groups. ``It is
historic, and it will have a defining impact on the region.''
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is most pressing in Maine, where practically all
open land is owned by industrial forestry companies. In an
unexpected move last June, Sappi Ltd., a South African paper
company, announced that it would sell 911,000 acres. And another
company, Bowater Inc., has said it would consider selling all of
its Maine holdings, more than 2 million acres, after completing a
pending $2.5 billion acquisition of Avenor Inc., a Canadian forest
products company. In all, as much as 15 percent of the state may be
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Sappi, which gained control of the land four years ago when it
acquired S.D. Warren Co.'s forestry operations from Scott Paper
Co., is selling heavily harvested softwood tracts in wild
mountains, moose country glittering with countless lakes, streams
and bogs.
</P>
<P>
   As timberland it is worth at least $200 an acre, but some
waterfront sections are prime real estate, and the ecological worth
is inestimable.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, state conservation groups and private bidders are
trying to put together deals for Sappi land, although details are
not known. Their ideas range from buying conservation easements or
critical tracts to more far-reaching plans.
</P>
<P>
   And while the tracts are so big that other paper companies are
the likeliest bidders _ the outcome Sappi says it prefers _ the new
owners might be tempted to carve out prime parcels for real estate
developers, a prospect that has conservationists and many local
people alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``East of the Mississippi, there isn't another area of
wilderness-like terrain of this magnitude left anywhere,'' said Jim
Glavine, who owns Beaver Cove Camps on Moosehead Lake, at 75,000
acres the largest lake in New England. ``If you look across the
shoreline, you don't see anything. Essentially, there is nothing.
There are no lights to see in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity for conservation-minded folks and
residents and people who live and work in the area and make a
living from everything from forestry to tourism to see to it that
what we see when we look out across this lake doesn't change.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The most ambitious plan, if not the likeliest, would convert
most of Sappi and Bowater's lands, along with other tracts, into a
huge national park including parts of the Allagash Wilderness
Waterway, surrounding Baxter State Park and Moosehead Lake and the
100-Mile Wilderness stretch of the Appalachian Trail.
</P>
<P>
   Jym St. Pierre, the Maine director for Restore the North Woods,
a conservation group that advocates creating a 3.2-million-acre
national park and preserve, said, ``From Mount Katahdin to
Moosehead Lake, the region has the collection of natural, cultural
and historic resources that qualify it for a park, and it has large
ownerships with land for sale and is virtually uninhabited.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Angus King called plans for a national park misguided.
``I am dead set against the idea,'' he said in an interview. Like
many other political leaders in Maine, he views the timber industry
as too important to supplant.
</P>
<P>
   King said that though it was not feasible for the state to
acquire the whole tract, it hoped to make a bid for part of the
land for conservation soon.
</P>
<P>
   Many local residents join the governor in not embracing the
creation of a national park. People are used to the gravel scrapes
and clear-cut scabs that tally forestry's contribution to the
state's economy and its effects on the state's environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone buys the land and won't let us cut on it, we are
all going to be out of a job,'' said Charles Libby Sr., a trucker
who was about to haul a semi-trailer of chips to a pulp mill.
``Right now, the way I feel, we have enough tourists up here. We
lock the gate down on the Interstate, it wouldn't bother me a bit.
Keep them out. We've got plenty of parks.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest concern of many people who live in and near the
woods is that they would lose access to the land if the government
took it over.
</P>
<P>
   Even though forest product companies control almost all of the
woods, they let anyone fish or hunt, hike or ski, or cross their
property in canoes or snowmobiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the tourists who come up here are ecotourists,'' said
Toni Blake, executive director of the Moosehead Chamber of
Commerce, based in Greenville at the foot of the antler-shaped
lake. ``They want to do the hiking and the biking and to get out in
the woods. Snowmobiling is a big industry, and I think that would
all change. A national park is something that sets restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Candeloro, who owns a sporting camp in Kokadjo, said:
``Right now with Sappi, we have the best land-use deal in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The park's advocates are proposing that part of it be held as a
preserve open to uses like hunting that are not allowed in parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conundrum of the whole thing,'' said Garrett Conover, a
canoeing outfitter and guide, ``is the people of Maine are
desperately afraid of federal controls because of lack of access.''
</P>
<P>
   He supports public acquisition of the land, which despite the
relentless logging he considers the best canoeing region this side
of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in history ever made the mistake of putting aside too
much wilderness,'' Conover said.

Help for McNair 
gives Oilers hope
<TEXT>
<P>
   New receivers must catch on fast
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ The Tennessee Oilers have stockpiled enough
talent that they could have their best and most explosive offense
since the run-and-shoot era.
</P>
<P>
   In the team's last season as the Oilers, Tennessee is planning
to make the playoffs for the first time since winning the AFC
Central title as the Houston Oilers in 1993. Last week's 31-16
preseason victory at Atlanta showed offensive production should
increase drastically for the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got weapons at every position, just like we did in the
run-and-shoot,'' says guard Bruce Matthews, a 10-time Pro Bowl
selection entering his 16th season. ``Our offense from that era has
a special place in my memory because it was really united. We were
close. We played together for a long time. And we were
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers reached the playoffs an NFL-high seven consecutive
seasons from 1987-93. They consistently ranked among the NFL's top
three in scoring, total offense and passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This offense has talent, too,'' Matthews says. ``We just don't
have as much experience playing together. We have the kind of
personalities we need to develop the kind of unity you need to win
the close games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's refreshing to see so many talented young players with
humility.''
</P>
<P>
   In Steve McNair's first full season as the No. 1 quarterback in
1997, the Oilers finished 8-8 while running the ball 57 percent of
the time _ the top figure in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie George followed his 1,368-yard rushing performance as a
rookie in 1996 with 1,399 yards, though his production dropped near
the end of the season because of an injury and the wear and tear of
facing eight-man fronts so often.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Fisher says, ``Of the seven teams that ran the ball
more than they threw it, six made the playoffs.'' Fisher emphasizes
the run (the Oilers were fourth in the NFL). He wants to get more
production out of a passing game that ranked 29th.
</P>
<P>
   ``The running game set the standard last season,'' Fisher says
of the 151-yard average that was the highest by the Oilers since
1980, when Earl Campbell helped generate 165 a game. ``Our goal was
to be able to run against the eight-man front, and we did.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season, I think defenses will take the same approach.
They'll want to stop the run and force us to pass, so we need a
more efficient passing game. Steve will have to throw well enough
to get the defense out of the eight-man front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our passing production has to increase, and that
responsibility falls on Steve. He's head and shoulders above where
he was last year. He understands the plays and reads.''
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, Fisher, general manager Floyd Reese and
director of player personnel Rich Snead targeted the primary
weakness in an offense that averaged 307 yards and 20.7 points and
decided they had to acquire big-time receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Frank Wycheck led the team in receiving the last two
years. Willie Davis (43 receptions) and Chris Sanders (31) were the
only wideouts with more than 14 catches.
</P>
<P>
   First, Reese signed Pittsburgh's Yancey Thigpen to a five-year,
$21 million contract that, at the time, made him the highest-paid
receiver in NFL history. Thigpen, who caught 79 passes for 1,398
yards last season, has been to the Pro Bowl two of the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Oilers used their No. 1 draft choice on Utah's Kevin
Dyson. He and Randy Moss were rated by NFL scouts as the two best
receivers in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen (6-1, 203) and Dyson (6-1, 201) elevate the talent level
at receiver and add size _ which was one of Fisher's goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a lot of talent, especially a lot of young
talent, guys can get confused unless they know their roles,''
Thigpen says. ``You have to know what the guy next to you's going
to do, and that only comes with experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers have been unable to contain their enthusiasm for
Thigpen, who is 100 percent healthy after offseason surgery on his
foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I can contribute is to make the big play when we're down,
make an unbelievable catch when we need it the most,'' Thigpen
says. ``I think I can help this offense with my enthusiasm in the
huddle. So much of this game is mental, and my adrenalin is really
pumping during games.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyson, who is competing for the starting job opposite Thigpen,
got off to a slow start in camp but caught a 46-yard touchdown pass
in the win over Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dyson's got outstanding size and speed, and he works hard,''
McNair says. ``He's still learning the system, and once he does,
his natural ability will take over and you'll see him become a
great player.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who restructured his contract to free up salary-cap room
to sign other players, has worked overtime with Thigpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yancey's a go-to guy who's so dependable,'' McNair says. ``He
works hard to set an example for the younger receivers. He makes
the crucial catch. He's going to make my job a whole lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Wycheck had 116 catches over the last two seasons, making him
more of an H-back than a true tight end, so the Oilers signed free
agent Jackie Harris from Tampa Bay. Harris used to be one of the
top tight ends in the league but has been limited to 49 catches
over the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the additions, the offense is still built around McNair
and George.
</P>
<P>
   McNair has shown improvement in each of his four seasons, and
because Les Steckel is in his second season as offensive
coordinator, McNair should be more knowledgeable and comfortable
with the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Starting regularly for the first time, McNair completed 216 of
414 passes for 2,665 yards last year. He threw 14 touchdown passes
and 13 interceptions and needs to improve his 52-percent completion
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   He was more dangerous as a runner than a passer, rushing for 674
yards and scoring eight touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to become more consistent,'' McNair says. ``I'm
working hard to get on the same page with my receivers. We have to
develop consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so fired up about this offense. We've got so much
athleticism. And the best thing is that every player is willing to
do whatever it takes to be successful.''

   REDMOND, Wash. _ Significant contrasts are part of the
adaptation process for Stephen Keppler, head professional at a
metro Atlanta club, at the 80th PGA Championship this week. On
Sunday, Keppler, 37, the four-time Georgia PGA player of the year,
longed for a few pre-flight glimpses of Sahalee Country Club, but
had no time to watch the PGA preview show on CBS-TV Sunday. It
conflicted with a member-guest tournament, a summer highlight for
Stephen and his staff. So much for research opportunities. Armed
with a few details from the weekly golf periodicals, Keppler was on
site at the tree-lined venue Monday, striking balls on the Sahalee
practice range between Colin Montgomerie and Davis Love III.

U.S. OFFERS $2 MILLION REWARD IN EMBASSY BOMBINGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
and NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. government is offering a $2 million reward
for information leading to the capture of the ``despicable
cowards`` responsible for deadly attacks on two U.S. embassies in
East Africa, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This nation ... will not be intimidated,'' Albright said at a
meeting of State Department employees that was part memorial, part
call to action. ``Although terror can turn buildings to rubble and
laughter to tears, it can never, will never, deter America from its
purpose or presence around the globe,'' she declared. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Twelve Americans were among the 202 people killed in Friday's
blasts in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, that wounded
more than 5,000. More than 100 FBI agents have been sent to the two
countries to help conduct the investigation with Kenyan and
Tanzanian law enforcement personnel.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen people were detained for questioning Monday in Dar
es Salaam, but Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice told
reporters ``don't attach too much importance'' to what she
characterized as a ``routine roundup.'' She said those in custody
had not been formally charged, but ``we want to hear what comes out
of these suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the detainees were Iraqis or Sudanese, according to wire
service reports.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq and Sudan are on the State Department's annual list of
terrorism sponsors. The Clinton administration and Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein are longtime enemies and Sudan is ruled by
fundamentalist Muslims who are fighting a civil war against
Christians. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; State Department officials praised the efforts of an embassy
guard in Nairobi who refused to open a gate into the embassy to a
truck suspected of carrying the bomb, despite having grenades
thrown at him.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman James Foley said the guard, who he would not identify,
``not only performed heroically but as horrific as the bombing was,
probably helped to minimize the damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley said the guard is still alive and though his story cannot
be independently verified, ``it is a seemingly plausible account.''
</P>
<P>
   As the investigators questioned suspects and witnesses, the
bodies of 11 of the 12 Americans killed by the blast were flown to
Germany to be prepared for return to the United States on
Thursday. &UR;  &LR; One of the U.S. victims was married to a Kenyan and will
be buried in that country &UR; .
</P>
<P>
   &LR; President Clinton will cut short a cross-country political trip
and return to Washington on Wednesday to meet with national
security personnel and participate in a memorial at Andrews Air
Force Base when the bodies come back. The service, set for 11 a.m.,
EDT, will include members of the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   At an appearance in Kentucky on Monday, Clinton warned that the
United States cannot shy away from its global role and must be
resolute in confronting terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be strong in dealing with this. We must not be
deterred by the threat of other action. There is no way out if we
start running away from this kind of conduct. We have to build a
civilized, open world for the 21st century,'' Clinton told a
Louisville audience. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Back in Washington, Albright said she plans to fly to Germany
on Tuesday and meet with wounded Americans being treated at
Landstuhl Hospital near Wiesbaden. She will then accompany the
remains of the victims on the trip home.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were honorable lives spent in service to our country and
our ideals,'' Albright said during her 15-minute address to the
State Department employees. ``Any work worth doing is done on
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   She reminded her audience that U.S. diplomats must often work
``where comforts are few and dangers are many'' as part of their
mission to help eradicate poverty and promote democracy. As a
result, Americans in overseas embassies will continue to be
inviting targets for terrorists ``because we use our strength to
resolve conflicts that some wish would go on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Albright told the employees to persevere with their
dangerous jobs to show that the victims of the bombings in Africa
did not die in vain.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's offer of a reward for helping to
capture terrorists is not unusual. The government put out a similar
bounty for information leading to the capture of Abdul Rahman
Yasin, a suspect in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. Ten
terrorists have been convicted of the attack and sentenced to long
prison terms. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Suspects in the shooting of two Central Intelligence Agency
officers near Washington in 1993 were arrested in Pakistan because
of the rewards, officials say. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In speech in Louisville, Clinton asked for a moment of silence
to honor the bombing victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts are heavy with the news that now 12 Americans _
brave people who are working to build a better world and represent
all of us abroad _ have lost their lives. To the nations of Kenya
and Tanzania, we thank them for their friendship to us. We grieve
for the loss of their citizens,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go forward now. You should all know that our teams are on
the ground in Africa. They're tending to the wounded; they're
providing security; they are searching and finding evidence. We
will do whatever we can to bring the murderers to justice,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The president noted that the world is rapidly moving toward
allowing the free movement of people, information, ideas and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a global society that I am convinced will bring all
Americans our nation's best years. But there has never been a time
in human history when we have been free of the organized forces of
destruction. And, the more open the world becomes, the more
vulnerable people become to those who are organized and have
weapons, information, technology and the ability to move,'' Clinton
said.

 CHICAGO BOYS, 7 and 8, CHARGED WITH MURDERING 11-YEAR-OLD GIRL   By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In a case that has sent chills across this city, two
boys, ages 7 and 8, have been charged with murdering an 11-year-old
girl _ striking her with a rock, sexually molesting her and
suffocating her with her own underwear _ apparently to take the
bright blue bicycle she had been riding, the police said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile justice experts said they knew of no case in which
younger children had been prosecuted for murder in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and the police said on Monday that on Sunday evening
the boys confessed to the killing two weeks ago of Ryan Harris, an
honor student who had just finished fifth grade. After killing Ryan
in an alley behind a building on Chicago's South Side, the
8-year-old rode his bike home and watched cartoons, and the
7-year-old went home to play with a puppy, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the boys appeared for a probable cause hearing in
Juvenile Court, their feet swaying above the floor as they sat
before Judge Gerald T. Winiecki. The 7-year-old spent most of the
hearing drawing hearts, a house and a rainbow with colored pens on
one of his lawyer's yellow legal pads.
</P>
<P>
   Slayings by children in recent years have stunned the nation and
led many states to take a tougher approach to juvenile crime.
Chicago has seen several horrifying crimes involving children,
including a 1996 case in which two boys, 10 and 11, dropped a
5-year-old boy to his death from the 14th floor of a housing
project. But the Ryan Harris case has struck an especially painful
nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this era, the ages of these offenders is very frightening
to hear about,'' said Mayor Richard M. Daley. ``Children are
growing up much, much faster.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Winiecki ordered the boys held and ruled that there was probable
cause to try them on juvenile charges in the slaying. Reporters
were allowed to attend the probable cause hearing, but were
instructed by Winiecki not to disclose the boys' names.
</P>
<P>
   In court and at a news conference, the police and prosecutors
described how they believe Ryan was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that the 8-year-old boy knew Ryan, who lived in
a working-class suburb just south of city but was staying with a
godmother in Chicago's impoverished Englewood neighborhood this
summer so she could attend a day camp at a high school there. They
said that on July 27, Ryan and the 8-year-old went to ride their
bicycles around the high school and ended up in an alley behind a
building.
</P>
<P>
   There, the police said, they were met by the 7-year-old, and the
boys began throwing rocks. Detective Alan Nathaniel testified on
Monday that the 7-year-old told him he threw a rock that struck
Ryan in the back of the head and knocked her off her bicycle,
apparently leaving her unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   The detective testified that the 7-year-old said that the boys
moved her bicycle to a wooded area about 20 feet away and ``they
both took one arm of Ryan and dragged her to the same wooded
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, the detective testified as to what the 7-year-old said.
``They began to play with her very softly. He said they pulled her
panties down. After he pulled her panties down, he put them in her
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel said that the 7-year-old told him he then began
rubbing leaves and branches around her nose and mouth. Police found
pieces of leaves stuffed in Ryan's nostrils. At some point, the
police said, one or both of the boys molested Ryan with what
Nathaniel called a ``small tubular object'' that ``caused a
half-inch gash'' around her genitals.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's body was found on July 28, in some tall weeds behind the
building. The police initially questioned the two boys as potential
witnesses in a door-to-door canvass of the neighborhood. The boys
said that they say a strange man lure Ryan into his car. But
investigators became suspicious when the boys changed their
stories, providing details that ``would only be known by the
detectives that investigated it and the perpetrators,'' said Sgt.
Stan Zaborac.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE LEGEND NO ONE HAS HEARD OF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., France)  (mk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he steps on the court with one of the all-time greats, with
a Connors or a Borg, he hears people say, ``Who the hell is this
guy?'' Mansour Bahrami has a story to tell, though, and it happens
to be the stuff of legend.
</P>
<P>
   There are Grand Slam champions, celebrity millionaires, who play
the stay-in-shape 35-and-over tennis circuit. Then there is this
Nuveen tour walk-on named Bahrami, who lost the heart of his career
to politics and poverty, but who has metaphorically triumphed over
a prohibitive class system, a cultural revolution and global
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   He is 42, and his first-round opponent Tuesday night in the
Citibank Champions tournament at Manhattanville College in
Purchase, N.Y., is Jose-Luis Clerc. Bahrami, a doubles specialist,
seldom gets very far in these crowd-pleasing events, but then, he
never claimed he would have been another John McEnroe, or No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know how good I could have been,'' he said.
``Realistically, I believe I was as good as Clerc, Gene Mayer, guys
who got to No. 5 or 6. But I didn't have the chance. My best 10
years, I didn't play.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and did we mention that Bahrami, an Iranian who lives with
his wife and two sons in Paris, has never in his life had a
personal coach?
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Tehran gardener who tended the grounds of a tennis
club, Bahrami was not allowed to use the courts and was once beaten
by authorities for sneaking on with friends. He had no racquet
until long after he had taught himself to play with dustpans,
pieces of wood and, when all else failed, the palm of his hand. He
taught himself so well that he forced his way onto those courts
and, much later, the Iranian Davis Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the overthrow of the shah in 1979, the return to the
country of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the denouncement of
tennis as an anti-Islamic, capitalist sport. Clubs were closed, the
men's tour stop in Tehran was eliminated. While McEnroe was
imagining great line-call conspiracies against him in the late
1970s, Bahrami was looking to break free from suffocating
repression.
</P>
<P>
   He left Iran on Aug. 8, 1980, with a short-term visa to France
that expired too soon and left him homeless and broke, on the
streets of Paris, in retreat from the immigration police. He
refused to seek political asylum, ``to be so selfish and forget
about everyone, my family.'' He said he was too proud, too
stubborn, to sleep on Paris' streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would walk all night,'' Bahrami said. ``Long, long nights,
when you feel like it would never be day again. But when the day
came, I could look like anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Until he would espy an officer of any kind nearby, and then it
was time to forget tennis, become a sprinter.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Bahrami eluded the authorities, until Iranian
expatriates helped him penetrate the local tennis community. His
tale of life on the run reached the news media. ``They wrote, `We
let dictators stay, yet we want to throw out a sportsman?'''
Bahrami said. He remained in Paris, played in various French
tournaments, including the Paris and French Opens. He still had his
Iranian passport, though. When he applied for visas to play in
places as far away as Australia, or across the border in Belgium,
the answer was always, ``Three months' wait.''
</P>
<P>
   He would say, ``By then, there is no tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Bahrami had a French passport, he was, for the sake
of a successful singles career, too old. He played mostly doubles,
made the French Open final with Eric Winogradsky in 1989 and earned
himself a few hundred grand hustling around the world until he
joined the seniors tour three years ago. He is a clown prince of
sorts, a Nastase-like shotmaker who can get under the skin of his
less sanguine opponents (read: McEnroe) in the heat of a match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read once where Rod Laver said I was one of the most
talented players to pick up a racquet, but what I've lost I've
already lost,'' Bahrami said. ``Now I play to have fun, to
entertain. I make the best of what I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and did we mention how Bahrami met his wife, Frederique? It
was on New Year's Eve, amid bumper-to-bumper traffic on the
Champs-Elysees. He in one lane, she in the other. He rolled down
the window and asked if it was French custom to kiss the person
next to you as the clock struck 12. Yes, she said. He got out of
his car, and, voila, out of another jam came something worth the
wait.

NEW YORK ASKS OXFORD TO RAISE RESERVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York State Insurance Department announced
Monday that it had asked Oxford Health Plans Inc., the troubled
managed-care company, to increase its reserves for its New York
plan by $152 million to ensure that it had sufficient funds to pay
medical claims over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The request came after the department completed its long-awaited
review of Oxford's finances, which it began last year after the
company fell months behind in paying its doctors and hospitals.
This is the third time in the last year that the department has
asked Oxford, one of the New York area's largest plans, with about
1.4 million members in the state, to add to its reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The department also issued a lengthy report on Oxford's
finances.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford underwent a sweeping restructuring earlier this year. The
company, based in Norwalk, Conn., named a new management team and
raised $710 million in new capital.
</P>
<P>
   The department said it had determined that Oxford had
underestimated the reserves it needed, based on actuarial estimates
of future medical claims, according to the deputy superintendent,
Bonnie Steingart. The state requires all health plans to have a
portion of future claims in cash. Ms. Steingart said she was not
aware of any actions taken by other states where Oxford conducts
business, like New Jersey or Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in the New York plan has grown, medical costs have
increased and Oxford is still making its way through piles of old
claims that had been lost or misplaced, she said. The department
calculated that Oxford's future claims and other liabilities in New
York were about $726 million, substantially higher than the
company's own estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The company also added $40 million in cash to the reserves last
month to cover the New York plan's holdings of stock in FPA Medical
Management, which filed for bankruptcy in July and is now worth
virtually nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford, which said Monday night that it had cooperated fully
with the insurance department, is expected to release its quarterly
financial results Tuesday. The reserves for the New York plan are
expected to be included in what analysts are predicting will be a
substantial earnings loss. Anxiety over the financial results have
helped push Oxford's stock down to new lows. It closed Monday at
$6.5625.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance department's action should give Oxford's New York
consumers and doctors some comfort, however. The department could
have taken more dramatic action, and the higher reserves mean
Oxford has more of a cushion to pay its claims for its current
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enhanced combination of resources and talent should
strengthen Oxford's position in the marketplace,'' Neil Levin, the
superintendent of insurance, said in a statement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Oxford emphasized that it had ample financial resources. ``Going
forward, the company has over $1 billion in cash and marketable
securities,'' said a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Oxford has resolved its problems, especially in its
ability to estimate its medical claims, remains to be seen. It
continues to work on fixing large-scale computer problems, which
helped lead to its operational chaos and caused the company to
seriously underestimate the cost of delivering care.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance department sharply criticized Oxford in an earlier
report on its market conduct, fining it $3 million and ordering it
to pay an additional $500,000 in restitution to its customers and
its doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The department said it would watch closely to make sure Oxford
was working toward developing a better system of tracking and
paying claims. Oxford is now in full compliance with all state
regulatory requirements, the department said.

   The embassy guard, whose name has not been disclosed, has told
American investigators that he refused to allow the truck through
the rear gate and that as a result, one of the occupants of the
truck jumped from the car and opened fire on him, possibly throwing
hand grenades. The guard said he ran for his life. Moments later,
he said, a bomb in the truck exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story has to be verified, but if it's true, he really did
a tremendous job,'' Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering said
of the guard. If the truck had gotten past the gate and into the
basement parking lot of the embassy, Pickering said in an
interview, ``the whole building might have come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Kenyans who say they witnessed the blast offer a similar
account of a truck bomb.
</P>
<P>
   A Kenyan security guard at the embassy, Joash Okindo, who was
wounded in the bombing, told the Kenya Television Network Monday
that five swarthy men had driven up to the entrance of the basement
parking garage at the rear of the embassy, but were prevented from
entering by five Kenyan guards armed only with small staves.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Marine carrying a firearm approached, Okindo said, and
the attackers opened up with automatic rifle fire. He said that at
least one marine had returned the fire but that one of the
attackers then threw a hand grenade. The huge explosion followed.
</P>
<P>
   American investigators hope the witnesses' description of the
pickup truck and its passengers can help identify the terrorists
who carried out the attack in Nairobi on Friday and the nearly
simultaneous bombing of the American Embassy in Dar es Salaam, the
capital of neighboring Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Monday in Nairobi, Ochieng Okwach, a 42-year-old driver for the
Kenyan national parks service, said he was stopped in traffic about
50 yards from the embassy when he saw a yellow pickup with an
enclosed cargo area try to back through the embassy's rear gate
toward the underground parking garage, stopping about five yards
from the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, he said, a man leaped from the back of the truck
wearing a blue guard uniform that appeared identical to the ones
worn by security guards who protect both the parking lot and the
embassy's front entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who carried a black object the size of a walkie-talkie
in his right hand, made a throwing motion toward the embassy,
Okwach said. A small explosion followed.
</P>
<P>
   According to Okwach's account, the uniformed man ran back to the
truck and jumped in, a moment before the pickup truck exploded in a
powerful fireball that rocked the embassy and caused the collapse
of a nearby office building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was some robbers wanting to rob the bank,'' he
said. ``When I heard that blast, I said, `Oh, God, it is the end of
the world.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although his account would suggest that the passengers in the
truck were killed in the explosion, possibly in an act of suicide,
American officials say they have no evidence so far to show what
happened to the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Okwach said he had not been interviewed by any American
officials, nor by the local police.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Pickering, who has helped direct the State
Department's response to the explosions in Kenya and Tanzania, said
the guard at the embassy in Nairobi had reported that he first
noticed the light truck ``as it approached the embassy gate that he
was guarding.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the guard's account, Pickering said, the truck
``made a circle or turned around or something of that sort and
someone in the front seat asked the guard to open the gates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When he refused, somebody got out of the truck with what
appeared to be hand grenades,'' he said. ``He threatened the guard
and then began to throw hand grenades at him _ hand grenades or
some sort of long tubes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not open the gate, and he ran,'' he continued,
referring to the guard. ``And as he ran, there was a huge explosion
that threw him to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering said he did not know the condition of the guard or
whether he had been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very important to say that this is a story that
has to be confirmed,'' he said. ``But if it indeed is true, then
obviously it appears that the guard did not allow the truck to
penetrate the gate. He obviously did a very helpful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said investigators are sifting through
rubble at the embassy in Nairobi in search of evidence of the truck
that may have carried the explosives. Even tiny fragments of the
truck, they say, may allow them to identify the make and model of
the vehicle and its owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, we want to match the eyewitness accounts to the
physical evidence of the truck,'' said an administration official
who is involved in the investigations in Kenya and Tanzania,
speaking on condition that he not be identified. ``If we can match
it up, history shows that we're on our way to identifying the
perpetrators.''
</P>
<P>
   American investigators and embassy officials in Nairobi have
dismissed other reports about the explosion that have supposedly
come from witnesses, including one report suggesting that a truck
used in the bombing had American diplomatic license plates. ``There
are lots of rumors,'' said William Barr, an embassy spokesman in
Nairobi.

   RAMSTEIN, Germany _ In silence broken only by a drum roll, the
flag-draped coffins bearing the bodies of 11 Americans killed in
the explosion at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, last Friday
were received with full military honors early on Tuesday at the
American Air Force base here.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the 11, all employees of the State Department, are
to be flown to the United States on Thursday after Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright arrives. She will accompany their coffins
to Andrews Air Force Base, Md., where President Clinton will
receive them.
</P>
<P>
   A 12th victim of the bombing, Jean Dalizu, was to be buried by
her family in Kenya, where the U.S. ambassador, Prudence Bushnell,
who was slightly hurt, watched as the bodies were loaded aboard an
Air Force C-141 Starlifter.
</P>
<P>
   Pallbearers in the dress uniforms of the Army, the Marine Corps
and the Air Force, eight for each of the dead, marched stiffly onto
the long, gray plane and bore the 11 coffins past a color guard to
vans that took them to the morgue of the American military hospital
in Landstuhl.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 troops watched in silence during the hour it took for
the bodies to be taken off the plane after it taxied to a stop
shortly after 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that Albright was expected to arrive
here Wednesday night, and that she planned to greet some of the
American and Kenyan injured being treated at the military hospital
here.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials at the hospital said the bodies would be held
in the morgue for 48 hours to give relatives time to assemble for
the presidential ceremony on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 10 Americans flown to an American military hospital
here on Sunday, a woman who suffered severe eye injuries, was
evacuated to Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington late on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We became concerned about a possible loss of her vision,''
said Col. Robert Harvey, the physician who is director of the
Army's Regional Medical Center, in Landstuhl, near the base here.
He did not identify her.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Americans and five severely injured Kenyans, all embassy
employees, arrived here on Sunday on a C-141B Starlifter from
Nairobi, and Harvey said that two of the Kenyans and one of the
Americans _ a woman he did not name whose injuries included severe
damage to her lungs _ were in critical condition on Monday. The
other Americans now here, he said, would probably be flown on to
Washington on Wednesday on a regularly scheduled medical evacuation
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Those who could talk were being interviewed by Federal Bureau of
Investigation and State Department officials, hospital employees
said, and would be offered the services of a State Department
psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long, traumatic trip for them,'' Harvey said.
``There are still a lot of them that feel quite depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The names of all of the injured who arrived here on Sunday,
except for a critically injured Kenyan man being treated in
Homburg, in the Saar, were given by the Regional Medical Center as
follow: Americans _ Marine Sgt. Daniel Briehl, Ellen Bomer, Carol
Hawley, Clyde Hirn, Gary Lonnquist, Frank Pressley, Carolyn Riley,
David Robertson, Lydia Sparks, and Gary Spears; Kenyans _ Pauline
Abdall, Gideon Maritim, Mary Ofisi, and Carolyn Wayro.

U.S. OFFERS $2 MILLION REWARD IN EMBASSY BOMBINGS 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. government is offering a $2 million reward
for information leading to the capture of the ``despicable
cowards`` responsible for deadly attacks on two U.S. embassies in
East Africa, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This nation ... will not be intimidated,'' Albright said at a
meeting of State Department employees that was part memorial, part
call to action. ``Although terror can turn buildings to rubble and
laughter to tears, it can never, will never, deter America from its
purpose or presence around the globe,'' she declared. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Twelve Americans were among the 202 people killed in Friday's
blasts in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, that wounded
more than 5,000. More than 100 FBI agents have been sent to the two
countries to help conduct the investigation with Kenyan and
Tanzanian law enforcement personnel.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen people were detained for questioning Monday in Dar
es Salaam, but Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice told
reporters ``don't attach too much importance'' to what she
characterized as a ``routine roundup.'' She said those in custody
had not been formally charged, but ``we want to hear what comes out
of these suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the detainees were Iraqis or Sudanese, according to wire
service reports.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq and Sudan are on the State Department's annual list of
terrorism sponsors. The Clinton administration and Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein are longtime enemies and Sudan is ruled by
fundamentalist Muslims who are fighting a civil war against
Christians. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; State Department officials praised the efforts of an embassy
guard in Nairobi who refused to open a gate into the embassy to a
truck suspected of carrying the bomb, despite having grenades
thrown at him.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman James Foley said the guard, who he would not identify,
``not only performed heroically but as horrific as the bombing was,
probably helped to minimize the damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley said the guard is still alive and though his story cannot
be independently verified, ``it is a seemingly plausible account.''
</P>
<P>
   As the investigators questioned suspects and witnesses, the
bodies of 11 of the 12 Americans killed by the blast were flown to
Germany to be prepared for return to the United States on
Thursday. &UR;  &LR; One of the U.S. victims was married to a Kenyan and will
be buried in that country &UR; .
</P>
<P>
   &LR; President Clinton will cut short a cross-country political trip
and return to Washington on Wednesday to meet with national
security personnel and participate in a memorial at Andrews Air
Force Base when the bodies come back. The service, set for 11 a.m.,
EDT, will include members of the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   At an appearance in Kentucky on Monday, Clinton warned that the
United States cannot shy away from its global role and must be
resolute in confronting terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be strong in dealing with this. We must not be
deterred by the threat of other action. There is no way out if we
start running away from this kind of conduct. We have to build a
civilized, open world for the 21st century,'' Clinton told a
Louisville audience. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Back in Washington, Albright said she plans to fly to Germany
on Wednesday and meet with wounded Americans being treated at
Landstuhl Hospital near Wiesbaden. She will then accompany the
remains of the victims on the trip home.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were honorable lives spent in service to our country and
our ideals,'' Albright said during her 15-minute address to the
State Department employees. ``Any work worth doing is done on
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   She reminded her audience that U.S. diplomats must often work
``where comforts are few and dangers are many'' as part of their
mission to help eradicate poverty and promote democracy. As a
result, Americans in overseas embassies will continue to be
inviting targets for terrorists ``because we use our strength to
resolve conflicts that some wish would go on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Albright told the employees to persevere with their
dangerous jobs to show that the victims of the bombings in Africa
did not die in vain.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's offer of a reward for helping to
capture terrorists is not unusual. The government put out a similar
bounty for information leading to the capture of Abdul Rahman
Yasin, a suspect in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. Ten
terrorists have been convicted of the attack and sentenced to long
prison terms. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Suspects in the shooting of two Central Intelligence Agency
officers near Washington in 1993 were arrested in Pakistan because
of the rewards, officials say. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In speech in Louisville, Clinton asked for a moment of silence
to honor the bombing victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts are heavy with the news that now 12 Americans _
brave people who are working to build a better world and represent
all of us abroad _ have lost their lives. To the nations of Kenya
and Tanzania, we thank them for their friendship to us. We grieve
for the loss of their citizens,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go forward now. You should all know that our teams are on
the ground in Africa. They're tending to the wounded; they're
providing security; they are searching and finding evidence. We
will do whatever we can to bring the murderers to justice,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The president noted that the world is rapidly moving toward
allowing the free movement of people, information, ideas and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a global society that I am convinced will bring all
Americans our nation's best years. But there has never been a time
in human history when we have been free of the organized forces of
destruction. And, the more open the world becomes, the more
vulnerable people become to those who are organized and have
weapons, information, technology and the ability to move,'' Clinton
said.

FIX FOR SOME E-MAIL SECURITY PROBLEMS IS REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The leading provider of software that routes
electronic mail through the Internet plans to announce on Tuesday
that it has developed a simple and free fix for a security
vulnerability discovered in three e-mail programs made by Microsoft
Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The vulnerability, found in late June in Microsoft's Outlook
Express and Outlook 98 and in Netscape Mail, enables an attacker to
send an e-mail message containing a malicious program that could
damage or steal data.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has already developed and posted on its Web site a
patch that it says will protect its e-mail programs from the
attack, and Netscape is planning to release a software fix shortly.
</P>
<P>
   But for several reasons, officials of Sendmail, the company that
makes the software that manages the majority of mail systems, said
that installing the fix on the central electronic post office
rather than on each computer made sense. First, they said that as
many as seven other programs have now also been found to be
vulnerable. In addition, large companies that have their own e-mail
servers, as the electronic post offices are known, would have to
fix only one program rather than installing a patch on all their
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Though there have been no reports that the vulnerability has
been exploited, security experts are concerned because they say
there is no easy defense against such an attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Sendmail patch does not protect against a more recent flaw
discovered last week in some versions of Eudora, the most popular
electronic mail program for personal computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Allman, a founder of Sendmail, said Monday that his
company's patch would automatically trap e-mail messages carrying
dangerous attached files that could exploit the vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Sendmail plans to announce its patch in concert with Computer
Emergency Response Teams in Australia, Germany and the United
States. These government-sponsored agencies attempt to alert
computer users to security dangers and to provide information on
security developments for specific systems.
</P>
<P>
   Sendmail began work on its patch after response team officials
suggested that a single network fix might offer a better solution
than fixing millions of copies of e-mail software on individual
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Sendmail will offer its patch at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free is a good price,'' Allman said.

EX-DEFENSE MINISTER OF FRANCE SUSPECTED OF MONEY-LAUNDERING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A conservative former defense minister of France and an
aide have been formally placed under investigation on suspicion of
taking part in a money-laundering scheme to finance their political
party.
</P>
<P>
   The former official, Francois Leotard, who considered running
for the French presidency three years ago, emerged from a session
with Investigating Magistrate Laurence Vichnievsky on Friday in a
furor, yelling ``a fist in the face'' to a reporter who asked him
what had happened. Under French law, being placed under
investigation is one step short of being formally charged with a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the investigation, one of scores over the past
decade that have exposed shakedowns, phony front companies and
systematic fraud in the financing of nearly all French political
parties, was focused on 5 million francs _ $830,000 _ deposited in
small bills in a Luxembourg bank for Leotard's Republican Party in
June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, lawyers familiar with the case said, the party _
later renamed Liberal Democracy _ received a loan in the same
amount from an obscure Milan bank. The money was needed to finance
the purchase of the party's Paris headquarters, Leotard's
supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Jean Veil, said Leotard denied all the charges of
wrongdoing, as did the aide placed under investigation with him,
Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres.
</P>
<P>
   After a wave of party-financing investigations and indictments,
since 1995 French law has forbidden ``moral persons'' _
corporations and, presumably, the government _ from making
contributions. Allowances are openly provided to established
political parties from public funds.
</P>
<P>
   French press reports have said that Leotard told investigators
the cash had come from savings in special funds provided to the
party by the prime minister's office. The investigating judge is
understood to be pursuing charges that the Milan bank, Fondo
Sociale di Cooperazione Europea, agreed to be used as a front for
laundering the cash.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The French government budget this year included 48 million
francs _ $8 million _ in ``special funds'' for undisclosed purposes
and 346.7 million francs _ $57.8 million _ in ``designated special
funds'' thought to be for secret service agencies, Agence
France-Presse reported.
</P>
<P>
   Leotard, 56, was defense minister in the conservative government
of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur from 1993 to 1995. Since 1996 he
has headed the Union of French Democracy, a conservative umbrella
group that fractured earlier this year after some of its leaders
accepted support from the extreme-right National Front in order to
hold power in French regional parliaments. Leotard's own party left
the Union of French Democracy then.
</P>
<P>
   He and Philippe Seguin, the leader of the Gaullist Rally for the
Republic party of President Jacques Chirac, announced in May the
formation of a new conservative umbrella group called the Alliance,
in hopes of rebuilding the French right after it lost legislative
elections last year to a leftist coalition headed by Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, a Socialist.

(JT) 
 By TIM WEINER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The United States offered a $2 million reward
Monday for information about the embassy bombings, and
investigators focused on credible eyewitness reports of a truck
that may have carried the bomb that wrecked the American Embassy
here and the terrorists who carried out the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the CIA and the FBI were also evaluating other
preliminary leads. They included a terrorist manifesto delivered in
Cairo that praised Osama bin Laden, a Saudi financier whom American
officials have identified as a possible suspect, and vague warnings
picked up by a foreign intelligence agency that an Islamic
terrorist group might be planning an attack in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   The work of CIA officials took on a personal as well as
professional intensity as they mourned the death of one of their
own, an intelligence officer killed in the Nairobi explosion. The
CIA does not make public the names of its agents.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in Washington that
the reward would be paid for information leading to the conviction
of those responsible for the attacks. The bombings killed more than
200 people and wounded nearly 5,000 others in Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   In this decade, the American government has paid more than $5
million for information critical to solving other terrorist
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials here and in Dar es Salaam continued a grisly
search for evidence, meticulously combing through the rubble near
the ruined embassies and examining bodies in a hospital morgue for
pieces of metal.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA and FBI have sent large teams of investigators to
reconstruct the events leading to the bombings. Some 60 FBI agents
have been sent to Nairobi and another 60 to Dar es Salaam, and CIA
officers have come to the area from around the world. They are
interviewing witnesses like a Kenyan guard who told investigators
that he refused to allow a truck through the rear gate of the
embassy. The guard said that a man jumped out of the truck and
opened fire on him and may have thrown a hand grenade. Other Kenyan
witnesses provided similar accounts, including a Kenyan driver who
said he saw a man leap from the back of a yellow pick up truck and
throw something toward the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI team is larger than the one sent to investigate the 1996
bombing at the Air Force apartment complex in Saudi Arabia. FBI
officials are trying to determine what kind of explosive was used
in the attack, which will help focus their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Israel army radio said investigators suspect Semtex, a
powerful plastic explosive. If that was the case, the investigation
may focus on a network of known terrorist groups. In the 1970s and
1980s, Czechoslovakia sold 100 tons of Semtex to Libya, according
to the Czech president, Vaclav Havel. If the bomb was made of a
commercially available explosive, like dynamite, the investigators
may have to look in other directions.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators must check ports of entry by land, air and sea
on Kenya's porous borders. They must search commercial records like
bills of lading for suspicious shipments. The movements,
characteristics and capabilities of known terrorists must be
reviewed. The task could take years, American officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Among the facts the investigators had in hand today were a few
tantalizing leads.
</P>
<P>
   The Tanzanian police said that they had detained ``several''
suspects _ said to be Iraqis and Somalis _ but Susan Rice, the
assistant secretary of state for African affairs, cautioned that
the detentions were part of a routine roundup and should not be
taken too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   A foreign diplomat here said in an interview today that a
foreign intelligence service reported indications months ago that
an Islamic terrorist organization with bases in Afghanistan and
Pakistan might be planning an attack in Kenya. An American official
confirmed that U.S. intelligence agencies were aware of that
report.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were told to take care for flights coming from Pakistan,''
the foreign diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   But, like most such warnings, the information obtained by the
foreign intelligence service was indefinite _ too fuzzy for
effective countermeasures. The embassy here never went on alert, an
American official said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official of a foreign intelligence service also
confirmed tonight that his service had received the reports of a
possible attack in Nairobi. But he and other intelligence officials
said such reports come in constantly, and are often understood only
in hindsight. ``Intelligence pours in all the time,'' he said.
``You can't cry wolf every time.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigators were also analyzing a statement issued by a
previously unknown Islamic group taking responsibility for the
attack. American and foreign intelligence officials said that they
were still evaluating whether the manifesto was credible, and they
cautioned that claims of responsibility were easily made and
difficult to verify.
</P>
<P>
   In the Arabic-language communique, the group said it would
``pursue United States forces and strike at United States interests
everywhere'' unless changes were made in American policy in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The statement included several signs pointing toward bin Laden,
who has financed and otherwise supported previous terrorist attacks
on American outposts, according to U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   The communique, issued to a French news agency and made public
in Cairo this morning, said the group was inspired by the
statements of bin Laden. Four Saudis beheaded for bombing an
American installation in Riyadh in November 1995 said in televised
confessions that they, too, were inspired by bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The statement demanded the withdrawal of American forces in
Saudi Arabia and an end to U.S. support for Israel. It also called
for the release of imprisoned Islamic militants _ ``first and
foremost Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman,'' the blind cleric convicted and
imprisoned for life for his role in a plot to bomb several New York
sites, including the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has voiced similar demands in the past. He not only
sheltered Sheik Rahman but also harbored Ramzi Yousef, the
convicted mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center,
in homes bin Laden owned in Peshawar, Pakistan, near the Afghan
border.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also said ``a man from Egypt who belongs to the
Abdallah Azzam battalion'' carried out Friday's attack on the
American Embassy in Tanzania. Abdallah Azzam, who died in 1989, was
a Palestinian who fought alongside the CIA-supported Afghan rebels
battling Soviet invaders in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was bin Laden's partner'' in Islamic militant politics, an
American official said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   It was also in 1989 that bin Laden, whose family made a fortune
building mosques, royal palaces and government offices for the
Saudi royal family, began to build ``a multinational organization
for jihad, to purge the world of Western corrupters and their Arab
friends,'' the American official said. Jihad is the Arabic word for
holy war.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden now funnels tens of millions of dollars a year through
Islamic charities and banks to support terrorist groups and
extremist political movements in Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, the
Sudan, Yemen, and other nations, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA revived its bomb-shattered station here today, led by
officers from the agency's headquarters in Virginia. American
intelligence officers in Germany who track developments in Iran,
Iraq and Afghanistan, where the United States has no embassies, are
also investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI officials include a Rapid Start unit of FBI computer
analysts who inventory and collate evidence.

   WITH INVESTORS DEFENSIVE, SMALL-CAP STOCKS SKID
</P>
<P>
   After last week's stock-market rout, investors seemed defensive
and uncertain. Drug-company shares rose, but financial stocks were
weak, as the Dow industrials gave up 23.17 points, to close at
8,674.85.
</P>
<P>
   After rallying late last week, small-company shares faltered,
leaving the Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks below its
level of a week earlier. The index fell 4.16 points, or 1 percent,
to 411.64.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bond yields fell to one-month lows on expectations that
Asian financial turmoil would bolster demand at the Treasury's $37
billion quarterly debt sale this week. The benchmark 30-year bond
rose 2/32, or 67.5 cents per $1,000 bond, to 107 6/32, nudging its
yield down a basis point to 5.62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street passed a preliminary test of its computer readiness
for the year 2000 ``with flying colors,'' the Securities Industry
Association said.
</P>
<P>
   HMOS SAID TO OVERBILL MEDICARE
</P>
<P>
   Health-maintenance organizations have been receiving more than
$1 billion a year in overpayments from the Medicare trust fund
because they bill the government for administrative costs
attributable to their private customers as well as their Medicare
patients, federal investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   A NEW STATE LURE: WAGE REBATES
</P>
<P>
   The competition among states and even Mexico to attract
companies has spawned a new incentive, one strikingly
uncharacteristic for a market economy: wage rebates. For example,
Whirlpool will get back 4.5 cents of every dollar paid in wages to
the 1,100 workers it hired for a stove factory in Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   FORD CUTTING PRICES FOR 1999
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor, for the first time in over 30 years, cut the average
price of its 1999 model cars and trucks. The decrease averages 0.3
percent, or about $61, from comparably equipped 1998 models. The
prices of Ford's highest-volume cars, the Ford Taurus and Mercury
Sable, will fall by $1,000 to $1,800.
</P>
<P>
   A FREE FIX FOR VULNERABLE E-MAIL
</P>

   Sendmail, the leading provider of software that routes
electronic mail through the Internet, plans to announce a simple

Netscape e-mail programs.

   APPLE REPORTS BIG ORDERS FOR IMAC
</P>

</P>
<P>
   CHINA'S FIRM STANCE ON THE YUAN
</P>
<P>
   Asian markets have seesawed as traders play on concerns that
China will reduce the value of its currency, the yuan. But China's

overlook the fact that China responds more to politics than to
market pressure.

HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS TELL OF HORRORS AT TRIAL OF ACCUSED GUARD 
</HEADLINE>

 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three Holocaust survivors, testifying in the federal
case against a Brooklyn man accused of hiding his wartime role in
liquidating European Jews, said on Monday that no one who worked
for the Nazis in the death camps and ghettos of Poland could have
been unaware of the daily horrors and mass murders that took place
there.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three elderly witnesses said they knew or recognized
the man, Jack Reimer, 79, a retired Brooklyn salesman and
restaurateur who is accused of participating in atrocities and
misrepresenting his duties for the German army on his application
to immigrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the survivors, testifying before Judge Lawrence M. McKenna
of U.S. district court, graphically described conditions in three
of the places where Reimer is alleged to have served as a commander
of SS guards.
</P>
<P>
   Sophie Degan, for instance, spoke of her arrival, 17 years old
and alone, at the cold and eerily silent Trawniki concentration
camp in Poland in late 1943.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought something was wrong,'' Mrs. Degan, now 71,
recalled. ``We saw there were puddles. They were red _ red puddles.
I remember they were shining.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the prisoners' barracks, the new arrivals from the Warsaw
ghetto saw that the rooms had been recently occupied. There were
clothes, utensils and other personal belongings tossed onto the
floor. But she and her fellow inmates, already veterans of two Nazi
labor camps, found only corpses _ with the exception of a small boy
of about 2 who was soon taken away from the lonely women by the
Nazi guards.
</P>
<P>
   The men in their group were assigned to feed the dead bodies
onto bonfires after removing any gold teeth or jewelry they found,
Mrs. Degan added. ``You could not help but see the glow, the red
glow,'' she said. Then she added, softly: ``And the smell.''
</P>
<P>
   Trawniki was also a Nazi SS training camp. The Justice
Department says Reimer was not, as he claims, merely a German army
clerk removed from the day-to-day horrors, but a highly decorated
commander who took part in murdering 50 to 60 Jews at a pit at the
camp. It is asking McKenna to revoke his citizenship, a first step
to his deportation.
</P>
<P>
   As the survivors recounted their experiences, Reimer sat quietly
and impassively at the defense table. His lawyer, Ramsey Clark, did
not question any of them.
</P>
<P>
   But outside the courtroom after their testimony, Clark, a former
U.S. attorney general, said he considered the government's strategy
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the survivors' story is of enormous human
importance,'' he said, ``but I think it's obviously unfair to
individual rights and individual justice to tell those
heartbreaking stories in the trial of a man whose precious American
citizenship is at risk, when they have no relationship to him and
they don't know him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Reimer applied for permission to immigrate to the United
States from Germany in 1952, he told investigators that he was
drafted into the Soviet army in 1940 in his native Ukraine and
later captured by the Germans. Following his release from a
prisoner of war camp, he said, he went to work for the German army.
He worked first as a guard at Trawniki, then as a trainer of
guards, an interpreter and a paymaster, according to notes on his
application that were read in court.
</P>
<P>
   The government maintains that Reimer was also a commander of SS
guard units at the liquidation of both the Warsaw and Czestochowa
ghettos.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Hilton, 68, who lived through the destruction of the
Warsaw ghetto, testified that no one could have been there and not
known what was done to the Jewish residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see destruction constantly and people getting murdered and
killed day by day,'' Hilton said. ``It's impossible to not know
what's going on. It's just virtually impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   A survivor of the Czestochowa ghetto, Carl Langner, 72, made the
same point. ``I saw yelling and screaming and people running to
escape through the roofs, jumping from the windows, screams,
gunshots,'' he said, describing the roundup of Jews by Ukrainian
guards working for the Nazis, for deportation in September 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if anyone who was present in Czestochowa at the time could
not know what was happening to the Jews, Langner replied:
``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because everybody,'' he added, ``took part.''

BELL ATLANTIC STRIKE FELT FROM MAINE TO VIRGINIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a strike by 73,000 Bell Atlantic workers entered its second
day, the repercussions were felt on Monday by customers from Maine
to Virginia who were unable to get a telephone line installed or
repaired or reach directory assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Marcus, a spokesman for Bell Atlantic, acknowledged that
many customers had encountered delays in reaching a business or
repair offices, getting a telephone listing or placing an
operator-assisted call. Marcus asked the public to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to negotiate with customers on a case-by-case
basis to determine if they can wait for service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 23,500 managers, many with no field experience, have been
assigned to work 12-hour shifts and 6-day weeks to fill in for
workers who went on strike early Sunday after their old contract
expired.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it had no figures on how many customers could
not get help on Monday. But Marcus said that daily the company
normally handled three and a half million directory-assistance and
two million operator-assisted calls and received 29,000 calls for
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations continued throughout the day on Monday, with both
sides expressing hope for a swift resolution. ``We've been working
very hard to reach a settlement,'' said Jeffery M. Miller, a
spokesman for the Communications Workers of America.
</P>
<P>
   As Bell Atlantic workers set up picket lines throughout the
company's service area, 2,000 union members rallied in Brooklyn,
playing Bruce Springsteen's ``Born in the U.S.A.'' over
loudspeakers and listening to speeches by several politicians,
including Rep. Charles Schumer, who is running in the Democratic
primary for United States Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small fraction of Bell Atlantic's customers have been
directly affected by the strike, since basic telephone service has
not been disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen strike-related arrests were reported on Monday.
Three strikers were arrested at the Westchester Square Medical
Center in the Bronx, after they were seen about 1:30 p.m. cutting
telephone wires _ and then damaging cars belonging to supervisors _
at the hospital that had been just been repaired by nonunion
supervisors, said Detective. Robert Samuel, a spokesman for the New
York police.
</P>
<P>
   On picket lines, Bell Atlantic workers accused the company of
refusing to honor a commitment to offer early retirement to 14,000
eligible employees. The program was initiated at Nynex when it was
seeking to downsize and encourage workers in their mid-40's to
retire early with a full pension. Nynex merged with Bell Atlantic
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company has acknowledged that it did not anticipate that
demand for telephone service would skyrocket because of the
Internet and cell phones. So far, 11,000 workers have been allowed
to take advantage of the early retirement plan.
</P>
<P>
   Paddy Bambrick, a service technician and shop steward for Local
1101, said that many workers had counted on the retirement offer,
even going so far as to buy homes in other states but that many had
their hopes dashed. ``Bell Atlantic said they'd honor our contract,
and they haven't,'' he said. ``They lied to us.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street passed last month's preliminary test of
its readiness for the year 2000 ``with flying colors,'' according
to Donald Kittell, executive vice president of the Securities
Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   The 28 trading firms that took part executed about 40,000
carefully scripted trades of stocks, bonds and options, testing
conditions on Dec. 30 and Dec. 31, 1999, and Jan. 3 and Jan. 4,
2000. Computers at the stock exchanges and securities-processing
firms handled the date transition flawlessly, although there were
problems in the mock municipal-bond market.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of problems directly related to the inability of some
computers and programs to cope with the year 2000 popped up at the
trading companies but most were corrected during the course of the
days on which they occurred, according to industry officials.
Computers and programs with dates coded in two digits _ 99 for 1999
_ may crash or mishandle data when confronted with 00 representing
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Expanded tests are planned for next spring.

WHEELS SPIN ON ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-REDSOX-AVERY-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Gordon Edes 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette made a deal for a
lefthanded starting pitcher last Thursday, buying Pete Schourek
from the Houston Astros, Steve Avery's place in the rotation once
again seemed to be in jeopardy. And it may yet be that Avery is
bumped by the newcomer before the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Avery has a familiar ally, manager Jimy Williams.
And when the Red Sox, fresh from a triumphant tour of the American
League West in which they won 8 of 12, take the field at Fenway
Park Tuesday night for the first time in more than two weeks, Avery
will be on the mound to face the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, Dan got Schourek as a backup for us,'' pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan said. ``If something unfortunate were to happen
to Avery or (John) Wasdin, Schourek gives us a Plan B to go to.
That's a neat luxury to have, if we do have to make a move with
regard to a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most definitely, Avery deserves to be out there, he and
Wasdin both. It would be crazy to take them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Since displacing Jin Ho Cho, the Korean kid rushed to the big
leagues, Wasdin had made three good starts and appeared on his way
to an easy win Sunday, when the Red Sox gave him a 12-2 lead
against the Rangers. He couldn't get three outs in the fifth,
however, giving up five straight hits, and while it would appear
unfair if he's yanked from the rotation, Wasdin could be in trouble
if he struggles in his next turn.
</P>
<P>
   Avery, meanwhile, had failed to get past the fourth inning in
two successive starts but came up big last Tuesday in the Kingdome,
when he shut down free-swinging Seattle on two hits and a run in
six innings.
</P>
<P>
   That 2-1 win raised Avery's record to 8-4, and despite his 5.18
ERA, the Red Sox are 10-4 when he pitches. They are 2-3 in Wasdin's
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stayed ahead of hitters and expanded the strike zone with
his changeup,'' Kerrigan said, explaining Avery's turnaround
against the Mariners. ``He didn't get into too many dangerous
counts, 2-and-0, 3-and-1.''
</P>
<P>
   Scouts who have tracked the Red Sox the last two weeks said
Avery's fastball seldom ventured above the 82-84 m.p.h. range. But
that merely serves to underscore how Avery is gradually succeeding
in his transition from a power pitcher to a sinkerball/changeup
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's all the way convinced in his mind that
ultimately he's got to be a Randy Jones, Frank Tanana, John Tudor
type, the crafty lefthanders,'' said Kerrigan, rattling off the
names of lefthanders who relied on finesse.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he understands the way he has to pitch now. He understands
he's a ground-ball pitcher, effective when he keeps the ball down.
He plays a game of keepaway against righthanded hitters, tries to
get them to pull that changeup away so they hit ground balls to
short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then he gets it in his head that he's still a
power pitcher and goes back to his old overhand delivery. But most
of the time, he keeps his arm in a lower slot. He reminds me a lot
of Tommy John, in the way he uses his fastball and changeup, though
Tommy John used a little lower arm slot.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams's faith in Avery was demonstrated last September, when
the manager gave him the start that triggered a $3.9 million option
for this season. And while Duquette seemed to hint last week that
Schourek would go directly into the rotation, Williams had other
ideas. ``After what he did in Seattle, Avery deserves to start,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   If Duquette had succeeded in his long-shot attempt at landing
Randy Johnson, Williams would have had no choice but to jettison
Avery or Wasdin from the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   But in many respects, Schourek offers little in terms of an
upgrade from what the Sox already have. He admitted himself that he
was the least consistent and most expendable of the Astros'
starters after they acquired Johnson, and his history of elbow
problems has robbed him of the dominance he showed in 1995, when he
won 18 games for the Cincinnati Reds and finished second to
Atlanta's Greg Maddux in the Cy Young Award voting.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Schourek is in the bullpen, even though it has been
four years since he pitched in relief and it's uncertain whether
his elbow can handle the strain.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan said that Schourek will be given plenty of time to warm
up and won't be brought in during an inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been much more effective as a starter than a reliever,''
Kerrigan said, ``and now with his past arm history, we'll have to
see what he can do out of the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' problems at the bottom of their rotation, Kerrigan
said, all stem from the season-ending knee injury lefthander Butch
Henry suffered back in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought (Brian) Rose could supplant him, but that didn't
work out,'' Kerrigan said, alluding to the rookie whose season was
cut short by a bone spur in his right elbow. ``We tried (Derek)
Lowe, (Robinson) Checo, Cho, it didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember back in spring training, when it looked like we had
eight starters? You just never have enough pitching.''

FOOD-STAMP FRAUD RING IS BROKEN UP, U.S. SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal authorities said Monday that they had broken
up the largest food-stamp fraud ring ever in New York, a $60
million scheme in which individuals sold their food stamps to
Chinese takeout restaurants, which in turn sold them to Hispanic
grocers, who then redeemed the coupons from the government.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, federal prosecutors said, grocers with hundreds
of thousands of dollars in annual sales had redeemed millions of
dollars' worth of food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The case was unusual both for its vast scope and for the fact
that the scheme cut across ethnic lines. But the mechanics of the
scheme, in which individual recipients sold their coupons for less
than face value and business owners illegally turned them in to the
government, were typical of food-stamp frauds, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to change the plan, since it works,'' Roger
Viadero, inspector general of the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
said in a telephone interview Monday night. ``Don't reinvent the
wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   The government unsealed documents showing that it had charged 18
people with defrauding the federal food-stamp program and with
money laundering. Prosecutors said large sums of money from the
scheme ended up in bank accounts in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The case stemmed from a two-year investigation by the FBI and
the Agriculture Department, prosecutors said. FBI agents began to
arrest suspects on Friday and over the weekend, prosecutors said,
including owners of some of the grocery stores that are accused of
participating in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Nine suspects were arrested in the last few days, prosecutors
said, while the rest are at large.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant U.S. attorney, Cheryl Krause, told Magistrate Judge
Douglas Eaton in court on Monday that several of the defendants
were believed to have fled to the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Four suspects who appeared in court in Manhattan were held
without bond, including Reynaldo Cespedes and his wife, Ibaniris,
who were described in court records as managers of numerous grocery
stores. A lawyer for Cespedes could not be reached by phone Monday
night. His wife's lawyer, Martin Klotz, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fugitives was Victor Ramirez, described in the
documents as the owner of three Hispanic grocery stores in the
Bronx and Manhattan that were used in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   None of the owners of the Chinese restaurants were among those
charged. Prosecutors would not say why, saying only that the
investigation was continuing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Viadero of the Agriculture Department said that the government
had tried to combat the estimated $3 billion in fraud in the $26
billion program by giving food-stamp recipients cards that transfer
benefits electronically, avoiding the use of coupons, which are
like cash and can be lost or sold.
</P>
<P>
   But the electronic cards have yet to be introduced in New York,
Viadero said.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors, the defendants bought large quantities
of food stamps from Chinese take-out restaurants in New York and
other sources. The records do not explain how the Chinese
restaurants obtained the food stamps originally; food stamps cannot
be used to buy meals at restaurants, but officials said that many
individual recipients who get the coupons legally are known to sell
them on the street for a fraction of their face value.
</P>
<P>
   The coupons were then resold at a slightly higher price to the
grocery-store owners, the records show. The store owners had filed
for authorization to accept food stamps with the government
program, and were thus able to redeem them at full value.
</P>
<P>
   One telling piece of evidence, prosecutors said, was the
disparity between the annual sales volume of the grocery stores,
typically around $200,000 to $500,000 a year, and the value of the
food stamps that the same stores redeemed from the government,
which was many times more.
</P>
<P>
   In one such case cited in the complaint, a store called Stop 1
Food Market in the Bronx, in applying for registration in the
food-stamp program, estimated its annual sales to be about
$371,000. Of that, about $223,000 was from sales of fruit,
vegetables and other food eligible for purchase under the program.
</P>
<P>
   Yet over the next year, it redeemed about $3 million in food
stamps, said the complaint, signed by an agent with the Agriculture
Department.

BUILDINGS CHIEF TENDS TO MORAL FOUNDATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The torrent of falling bricks and scaffolding around
the city over the last year had already made Gaston Silva the most
quoted buildings commissioner in recent city history when the
crackdown on sex shops happened a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   To its surprise, Silva's prosaic department, with its fusty
permit books and cranky plumbing examiners, suddenly found itself
in the moral wetlands of the adult entertainment industry,
enforcing the new zoning law by measuring bikini coverage and
counting X-rated videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't quite what Silva imagined when he took the job two
years ago. Especially because he now has a new headache: the wives
of the inspectors, who would prefer to see their husbands checking
welds and concrete strength instead of female flesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the wives of the inspectors have been complaining,''
he said last week, shaking his head while trying to suppress a
grin. ``They don't like this duty for their husbands. Our guys are,
you know, building inspectors, and here they are going with vice
cops to these places. They have a very different background.
They're used to different things. But somehow'' _ and here the grin
can be restrained no longer _ ``somehow, they're handling it.''
</P>
<P>
   (The inspectors have the right to opt out of these assignments
on moral and religious grounds. For the record, none have done so.)
</P>
<P>
   It's been that kind of year for Gaston Silva, the unpretentious
architect chosen by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to head the buildings
department in 1996, who has been unable to stay out of the news
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   He got his first bad-news beep while on vacation with his family
a few days before he started work, after a truck knocked down a
sidewalk shed on Lexington Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent beeps never stopped: Yankee Stadium, the bricks
of Madison Avenue, the Selwyn Theater, the Conde Nast building.
Just Monday, a sheet of bricks fell 39 stories from a midtown
skyscraper.
</P>
<P>
   Defying the very human desire to find a pattern in random
events, Silva insists that the spate of building failures cannot be
traced to a single phenomenon or trend. He doesn't joke about
premillennial superstitions or the city's jellied moral
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   But when pressed, Silva, who generally has the last word in the
administration on how to proceed after major building accidents, is
fatalistic enough to acknowledge that every failure is ultimately a
manifestation of human error.
</P>
<P>
   ``Materials don't fail; people fail,'' he likes to say, quoting
from a large tome on design failures atop his desk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of the incidents, like Madison Avenue and the Selwyn
Theater, were clearly the result of contractor negligence, and
Silva doesn't hesitate to say so. Others, including the various
falling parapets, are more likely due to improper maintenance,
while some, including the Conde Nast building, remain mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   He said none of the accidents are related to the Giuliani
administration's policy of self-certification, begun by his
predecessor and enthusiastically continued by Silva, under which
architects and engineers are allowed to assert that their plans
meet city specifications to receive a permit and speed through
bottlenecks. The city is supposed to spot-check the projects for
compliance, although inspectors say such checks are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Some architects and engineers say that Silva, calm and rarely
given to angry displays, has failed to put the fear of God into the
construction community. But though he acknowledges the presence of
shoddy, irresponsible contractors, he has an architect's faith in
professional competence, and says many people have the wrong idea
about the department's abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Buildings Department can never guarantee that a building
is built properly,'' he said. ``We do guarantee that a process has
been followed, an application filed by a licensed architect or
engineer, but we don't build the buildings. Even when an inspector
goes out, he's only looking at a small fraction of what's out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the mayor's appointments, Silva is not a longtime
Giuliani loyalist, having entered city government when the Koch
administration appointed him to the Landmarks Preservation
Commission. He hadn't even met Giuliani when he was moved in 1996
from the board of standards and appeals to buildings. His true love
is design, particularly 17th-century Italian architecture, but his
refusal to discuss local buildings reflects a careful diplomacy
often noted by his colleagues in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a master mediator and problem solver,'' said James
Stewart Polshek, a prominent local architect for whom Silva worked
on several major projects, including the renovation of Carnegie
Hall. ``There are different kinds of architects, and he was a
manager-technician at the most sophisticated level.''
</P>
<P>
   Silva, 45, one of the few commissioners who drives himself
around town, spoke no English when he fled Cuba in 1960 with his
parents, who became teachers.
</P>
<P>
   After growing up with three families of relatives in one house
in River Edge, N.J., he graduated from architecture school at the
University of Pennsylvania, and now lives with his wife and two
young children in a brownstone in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   And no one is complaining that he is spending much more time on
the Conde Nast accident than on certain other establishments in
Times Square.

A SHOWER OF BRICKS FRIGHTENS N.Y. PEDESTRIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A section of masonry 12 feet high and 4 feet wide
came loose from the 40th floor of an office building on Lexington
Avenue Monday morning, showering the crowded midtown street below
with thousands of pieces of brick, two of which pierced the roof of
a commuter bus.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in the accident, which officials said
appeared to have occurred when badly rusted metal ties that held
the bricks in place broke as two workers used grinding tools to
perform a waterproofing job one floor below on a hanging platform.
</P>
<P>
   But the collapse at 10:19 a.m. caused moments of terror and
panic on Lexington Avenue between 46th and 47th Streets, as
pedestrians scrambled for safety, some darting into traffic to get
away from the building, witnesses said. Later, as city safety
officials moved in, cordoning off a four-block area, the street
became a deserted scene all too familiar after a series of recent
collapses around midtown: businesses closed, frustrated office
workers shut out of their buildings and angry drivers trying to
find a way around.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said Monday that the sidewalk below had not been
sheltered with a sidewalk shed, of the kind that now cover dozens
of walkways around city construction sites, because the work being
performed at the building was simply maintenance. Though the work
involved the removal of small numbers of bricks so that metal
flashing could be installed, it also did not require city
construction permits.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials at the scene said they were amazed that no one
was hit by the bricks, which first struck one of two scaffolds
hanging near the 39th floor of the building, the headquarters of
the brokerage firm Bear Stearns. The scaffold bowed in the middle,
and the two workers atop it narrowly avoided being hit and swept
off.
</P>
<P>
   Bricks then spilled from the scaffold, fell 33 floors to the
roof of a wider portion of the building and, witnesses said, seemed
to explode, sending shards into the street. At least two bricks
landed intact.
</P>
<P>
   The two intact bricks punched a jagged hole about a foot wide in
the roof of the bus, which is owned by Command Bus Lines and
ferries workers to midtown from Brooklyn. One brick lodged in the
bus' luggage rack and another broke through an empty seat and
landed on the floor. A third piece of white brick stuck in the top
of the bus like a bullet. Only a few passengers were aboard at the
time, police said. A woman passenger, who was not identified by
police Monday, was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, where she was
treated for trauma and released.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the city's Buildings Department said that
Lexington Avenue between 46th and 47th Streets would remain closed
until at least Tuesday morning, as would 46th and 47th between Park
and Lexington Avenues, as workers erect a protective shed over the
sidewalk along the east face of the building on Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   They will also build a wall along the edge of the wider,
six-story, portion of the building, which will serve as a ``splash
guard'' if more bricks fall, said Ted Birkhahn, a spokesman for the
Buildings Department.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He added that though repair work will now begin around the
clock, the accident was not as complicated or dangerous as the
recent scaffolding collapse at 4 Times Square, which killed one
woman and has shut down a block of 43rd Street for two weeks, or
the brick collapse last December at 540 Madison Ave., where a ton
of bricks came loose because dozens of metal ties had never been
installed to hold the bricks in place.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for the owners of the building,
World Financial Properties, said that the maintenance company, Horn
Exterior Restoration of Queens, had been making minor repairs on
the 45-story building since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said Monday that Horn Exterior has an excellent
safety record and is a sought-after exterior repair company for
tall aging office buildings. Earlier this year, the company was
brought in to stabilize and repair the walls at 540 Madison Ave.
</P>
<P>
   An executive familiar with the work on the Bear Stearns building
said Monday that though the building is relatively new by New York
standards _ it was completed in 1967 _ it now appears that many of
the metal brick ties that hold the bricks to the understructure of
the building are badly rusted, at least along the top of the east
side.
</P>
<P>
   But the brick apparently did not show signs of cracking or
bulging that would hint to engineers that there was such a problem,
said the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In 1996,
Raphael Bassan Consulting Engineers, a Manhattan firm, inspected
the building and classified it as safe in a report filed in January
1997.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Horn Exterior Renovation installed stainless steel
pins in the area of brick that fell Monday, a common stabilizing
procedure when bricks are to be removed temporarily nearby to
install flashing. A Horn worker inspected the area Monday, before
work, and did not see signs of the brick pulling away, the
executive said.
</P>
<P>
   But after the collapse, inspection of the brick shards revealed
the original ties that should have held the section in place were
rusted so badly that they were thin in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The executive said that the rust probably occurred because the
building has not been caulked and waterproofed properly and water
had seeped between the brick and the understructure over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Birkhahn, the Buildings Department spokesman, said Monday that
he was unable to confirm the executive's account.

AN ART DEALER REINVENTS HIMSELF, AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andrew Crispo has always been strangely in tune with
his times _ sometimes very strangely. He became the living symbol
of the excesses of the 1980s when he was investigated for _ but not
charged with _ a sadomasochistic murder that became known as the
``Death Mask'' case.
</P>
<P>
   An art dealer with a good eye and a bad reputation, Crispo more
recently became part of a '90s trend _ he filed for personal
bankruptcy protection at a time when such filings have been
soaring. (Of course, his case was unusual in many respects; most
debtors, for example, do not own paintings by Georgia O'Keeffe.)
</P>
<P>
   And now, he is about to begin a new chapter of his life. A plan
approved last week by the bankruptcy court will soon give Crispo
the money he needs to create a new art business. If he is
successful, he will give unknown artists a way to show their work
and, perhaps, help change the face of a small corner of Greenwich
Village.
</P>
<P>
   In a building on Little West 12th and Greenwich streets that
once housed Collier's magazine and later became a meat-packing
plant, Crispo has knocked together a series of rooms and uncovered
long-darkened skylights to create an enormous, light-filled space.
Some of the vast area will be used to display sculptures and to
stage arts-related events, he said; one section will be devoted to
a sort of flea market for artists, where they can rent small spaces
to display their works.
</P>
<P>
   It will be his vindication and his ``legacy to the art market,''
said Crispo, 53. ``I do think that I am on the road to a great
success _ and I don't think that I will let anyone be
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as his critics note, Crispo was hugely successful in the
past and threw it all away.
</P>
<P>
   He was raised in a Philadelphia orphanage, and though he never
formally studied art, by the 1970s he was a rising art dealer whose
spectacular shows attracted the world's biggest patron, Baron Hans
Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza. The baron's purchases were so
profitable for Crispo that the dealer came up with a scheme to hide
income from the IRS ; in November of 1985, Crispo pleaded guilty to
evading taxes of nearly $4 million, and was eventually sentenced to
five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   By then, of course, Crispo's personal life had also become very
public. In March of that year, the body of a Norwegian fashion
student, Eigil Dag Vesti, had been found. The partially burned
body, with two bullet holes in the back of the head, was wearing
only a leather mask of the sort used in sadomasochistic rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard LeGeros, who worked for Crispo, was convicted of the
killing and is still in prison. LeGeros accused his boss of
ordering the killing at the end of a sexual encounter, and claimed
that other bodies were buried at Crispo's house in Southampton
(none were found). Crispo has never been charged in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of all this, another man came forward to accuse
Crispo of sexually torturing him during a drug-fueled party at the
Andrew Crispo Gallery in 1984. Crispo's lawyer argued that the sex
was consensual; a jury acquitted him in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But the lurid details of those cases seemed to stick in many
minds, and were revived in David France's book ``Bag of Toys: Sex,
Scandal and the Death Mask Murder'' (Warner Books, 1992). The book,
a revised version of which is due out next year, contends that
Crispo was centrally involved in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Crispo said that for legal reasons, he cannot talk about Vesti's
murder, but he said the portrait of him painted by France is untrue
and has besmirched him. ``People who don't know me, hate me,'' he
said. And he thinks he has become a sort of boogeyman about whom
people make up stories, ``the Svengali of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Crispo's financial problems stem from his endless and
baroque disputes with the IRS. Practically everything Crispo ever
owned, including most of his art, was essentially frozen by the
IRS, so that while he was rich, he had almost no cash.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But the precipitating factor in the bankruptcy was his house,
which is a tale in itself. When he was released from prison in
1989, Crispo's first act was to visit his home in Southampton,
which his companion of more than 30 years, Arthur Smith, had just
redecorated. A week later, the house _ and all the art it contained
_ blew up.
</P>
<P>
   After a trial, he recovered about $5 million from Long Island
Lighting Co., which was found to have caused the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   He used some of the money to buy a mansion in Charleston, S.C.,
called the Pineapple Gate House. The idea, according to court
documents, was that he would renovate the house and run an antiques
business there.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1995, the asset-rich Crispo was running out of cash,
according to court filings. What little money he made came from
selling $127,000 worth of antiques through Smith's shop on East
60th Street. He was behind on the maintenance of his Manhattan
co-op, on loans for art he had bought and on the mortgages on the
Charleston house. Checks were bouncing.
</P>
<P>
   The day the Pineapple Gate House was to be sold in foreclosure
proceedings _ May 13, 1996 _ Crispo filed for bankruptcy
protection. He listed assets of more than $10 million and debts of
$6 million.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest unsecured debt _ roughly $1 million _ was to the
artist Robert Courtright, who had filed a lawsuit against Crispo in
1985 that was about to go to trial. In court filings, Courtright
had accused Crispo of keeping money that the artist should have
received from the sale of his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Crispo disputes this, though he allows that some sales may have
been left unaccounted for when the gallery collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   After the bankruptcy filing, months went by and Crispo missed
deadline after deadline for reporting to the court about his
finances.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1996, the court appointed Robert Weiner to serve as
bankruptcy trustee, a position that is uncommon in a personal
bankruptcy filing. Weiner, a corporate lawyer who is also an expert
in art law, began trying to organize Crispo's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what Weiner calls ``the folklore that Andrew owes a lot
of people a lot of money,'' he found that Crispo actually had
surprisingly few creditors.
</P>
<P>
   But he had a far deeper and sadder problem than his bankruptcy.
He was caring for Smith, who died of lymphoma last October.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was as grief-stricken as any widow or widower, Crispo
said, he did not have their legal rights. Smith had left the bulk
of his estate to his family in Georgia, which did not acknowledge
Crispo and tried to evict him from the apartment the two had
shared. So the legal wrangling began.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, two important financial events had occurred.
Weiner had sold the Charleston house for a record price of $3.1
million, a tribute, he said, to Crispo's eye for the valuable and
desirable. And the trustee had also negotiated with the IRS to
enable him to sell Crispo's art collection.
</P>
<P>
   Crispo has always been reluctant to part with any of his
paintings. ``These are my little children,'' he said. But he
decided to go along with the sale, he said, not just to raise cash,
but also in the hope that the auction would vindicate him as a
dealer and collector.
</P>
<P>
   It did. Many paintings _ by artists including O'Keeffe, Stuart
Davis, Edward Hicks and Arthur Dove _ sold for far more than their
published estimates, and very few works failed to sell at all. In
all, Crispo's collection raised about $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   With more than $10 million in cash on hand, the trustee was able
to agree to pay all of Crispo's creditors in full, with interest _
highly unusual in a bankruptcy case.
</P>
<P>
   And, even after putting aside more than $1 million to satisfy
any tax claims, and paying the lawyers' and the trustee's fees,
Crispo will end up later this year with several million dollars.
``I cannot wait to get my hands on that money and buy a wonderful
work of art,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: EMBASSY SECURITY IS NOT OPTIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 11:
</P>
<P>
   As Washington mourns those who died in Kenya and Tanzania last
week and begins the difficult hunt for the terrorists who spilled
so much blood, it must reckon with its own failure to safeguard
American diplomats. Not enough has been done to improve security at
American embassies and consulates, especially in places like Africa
where the threat of terrorist attack was considered low.
</P>
<P>
   A thoughtful blueprint for security enhancement was produced 13
years ago by a State Department advisory panel headed by Adm. Bobby
Inman, a former deputy director of central intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   It recommended a package of security measures designed to reduce
the vulnerability of diplomatic outposts to car or truck bombings
of the kind that convulsed the embassies in Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam on Friday. The full cost of instituting it, including the
renovation or replacement of more than 100 embassies and
consulates, was put at roughly $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a third of that money was ever approved by Congress,
and much of the work was never done. The unconvincing excuses range
from budget constraints to fears that better-fortified embassies
would be inconsistent with the open country they represent.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic compounds in low-risk regions were neglected, despite
the obvious threat that terrorists might be deflected to less
secure embassies when prime targets in the Middle East and Europe
were better protected.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when terrorism presents as great a threat to the
security of Americans overseas as do foreign armies, spending the
equivalent of slightly more than 1 percent of the annual defense
budget on embassy security is hardly unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the safety of American diplomats less important than the
aesthetic quality of embassy buildings. One of the State
Department's prime responsibilities abroad is to ensure the safety
of the men and women, American and foreign, who work for it.
</P>
<P>
   That does not require an intimidating fortress. Exacting
construction standards, including reinforced concrete walls and
shock-resistant glass, can help harden buildings. No American
embassy anywhere should have an underground garage, even one
blocked by barricades. The driver of the bomb vehicle in Nairobi
was apparently trying to gain entrance to the embassy's basement
garage.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, embassies should have enough ground area to
allow a 100-foot security perimeter on all sides. For some capitals
that may require moving to a new site. In any trade-off between
convenience and security, security should prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders ought to find the money for these
improvements as soon as Congress reconvenes in September. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright and Undersecretary Thomas Pickering
seem determined to take remedial action.
</P>
<P>
   Other proposed responses under discussion in Washington are less
appealing, including the misguided idea that the United States
should retaliate against suspected terrorists even without hard
evidence of their involvement in a specific attack. Such revenge
fantasies would do more to incite terrorism than to deter it.
</P>
<P>
   Equally dangerous is the idea that the White House should lift
the presidential ban on government-sanctioned assassination so the
CIA can arrange for the murder of suspected terrorists. Democracies
that employ the techniques of terror risk becoming
indistinguishable from the terrorists they pursue.

STUDENTS MAY LACK REQUIRED IMMUNIZATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alan Hevesi, the city comptroller, criticized the
Board of Education on Monday for failing to keep accurate records
of student immunizations, saying about 30 percent of the students
in a group of high-risk districts his staff examined had not
received all the shots required by state law.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the board had not complied with a state law
requiring that students complete immunization for measles, mumps,
rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and polio within two
weeks of entering a school.
</P>
<P>
   In response, school officials said Hevesi had overlooked state
guidelines extending the amount of time allowed for the
immunizations, and that the student immunization rate had increased
since the period covered in his sample.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi made it clear that he was not interested in filing a
complaint for noncompliance with the law _ which he had
co-sponsored 19 years ago as a state assemblyman _ but in
pressuring the board into acting. He also conceded that his sample
of students was too small to permit conclusions about the entire
school system.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi's report examined 12 schools in three community school
districts _ District No. 7 in the Bronx, No. 19 in Brooklyn and No.
30 in Queens _ that had sizable outbreaks of measles during a
1990-91 epidemic that affected about 3,000 New Yorkers, according
to the Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi's staff members checked the records of 697 children in
those districts, 550 in the 1994-95 school year and 147 more in the
1996-97 school year. They found that in each survey, about 30
percent of the students checked had not completed their
state-required inoculations. Two-thirds of them lacked the
follow-up shot for measles.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi said his staff members also found that some schools had
poor methods of keeping records. In one case, a secretary at a
Queens school could not find the necessary paperwork to document
the immunization rate of nearly 100 percent entered in the state
database. After checking other records and questioning some
parents, the staff decided that the rate had been a simple guess.
</P>
<P>
   The need for keeping good records has been increased by the
recent surge in immigration, Hevesi said, which also increased the
number of parents who may not know of the state requirements or be
able to read health instructions easily.
</P>
<P>
   City Health Department and Board of Education officials pointed
out that much of the data in Hevesi's report was three years old
and that record-keeping methods had improved since then. As of
June, said the board's chief spokeswoman, Chiara Coletti, 89
percent of the 800,000 elementary and middle school students had
all their required inoculations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a city Health Department random check of the records of
60,000 students in 225 schools this school year, 84 percent had
completed all their shots, said Vincent Giordano, the board's
deputy executive director of student support services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't disagree that in 1995, 70 percent of students may not
have completed their immunization, but the rate is much higher now
_ at nearly 90 percent,'' Giordano said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Friedman, assistant commissioner of the city Health
Department's Bureau of Immunization, said the board's policy
complied with state guidelines issued after the law. Rather than
applying the two-week period to the interval after the student
enters school, he said, the guidelines allow it to apply to the
interval between vaccine doses. It takes a child on average about
eight months to complete all the doses for all the vaccines, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the board wanted to avoid forcing a child to take
too many shots too fast, and since many students start school
without their shots, following the state law blindly could endanger
a child.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Coletti said the size of the sample in Hevesi's study made
it impossible to draw conclusions about the status of the whole
system, a point Hevesi conceded at a news conference in response to
a question. ``We don't know that we can extrapolate for the whole
system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the board could be sued by parents of a child infected
by one who should have been immunized. ``This is a serious
liability issue for the board,'' he said.

 THOMAS M. MULRY, 73, A CRITIC OF SCHOOL ABSENTEEISM POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas M. Mulry, who was the senior member of the New York
public school system's Bureau of Attendance in 1985, when he
publicly criticized the schools' policies for handling absenteeism,
died on Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 73 and lived
in the Bronx all his life.
</P>
<P>
   He died during heart surgery, said his daughter Christine Gallo.
</P>
<P>
   Mulry delivered his criticism in Albany. At issue was the
question of how best to handle absenteeism in the school system,
which had 930,000 students, with 141,000 missing on any given day.
He contended that the system was increasingly bypassing and playing
down the bureau, thereby blunting the system's best weapon against
absenteeism.
</P>
<P>
   But school officials said the bureau had largely outlived its
usefulness and that new strategies were required. By then, the days
were long gone when truant officers prowled the streets and visited
homes to pick up hooky players. By 1985, weapons against
absenteeism included computerized switchboards that automatically
sent recorded messages to the homes of students who did not show up
at school.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau was founded in 1914 to oversee measures against
truancy, but its role dwindled in the 15 years before 1985. That
change, Mulry asserted, amounted to a failure by the school system
to enforce the attendance law.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the bureau in 1953 as an attendance officer, rose to
become assistant director in 1976 and retired in 1987. During his
last years in the bureau, he was its senior official because the
directorship was vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Mulry was in the Marines during World War II. He received a
bachelor's degree in education and master's degrees in education
and social service, all from Fordham.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his daughter, Ms. Gallo of Bayport, N.Y., he is survived
by his wife, the former Kathleen Claire Rahilly ; four other
daughters, Mary Virginia Lofsted of Manhattan, Julie Kaen of
Yorktown Heights, N.Y., Janine Corona, of Fairfield, Conn., and
Claire Mulry, of Edison, N.J.; two sons, Thomas Jr., of Little
Neck, N.Y., and William, of Fairfield, Conn.; 11 grandchildren; two
brothers, James P., of Austin, Texas, and Dr. Charles A., of
Beverly Hills, Calif.; and a sister, Barbara Backus, of Putnam
Valley, N.Y.

MANY HMOS PROFIT `EXCESSIVELY' FROM MEDICARE, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>

 By ROBERT PEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Health maintenance organizations have been
receiving more than $1 billion a year in overpayments from the
Medicare trust fund because their administrative costs are ``highly
inflated,'' federal investigators said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare is paying a disproportionate share of HMOs'
administrative costs'' _ much more than its ``fair share'' _ and
the government should try to recover the excess payments, the
inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services
said in a new report.
</P>
<P>
   The report came at a delicate time for the managed care
industry, which is being encouraged by Congress to play an
increasing role in serving the nation's 38 million Medicare
beneficiaries. Spokesmen for many HMOs have complained in recent
months that the federal government did not pay them enough to care
for Medicare patients, but this and other studies suggest that in
some cases they have been paid too much.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general, June Gibbs Brown, said that many HMOs
profit ``excessively'' from Medicare, because they bill the
government for administrative costs attributable to their private
commercial customers as well as their Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   In short, she said, HMOs have received ``an unreasonable
amount'' from Medicare because their administrative costs were
grossly and artificially inflated, by a total of $3 billion to $4
billion in the three years of financial reports that she reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the Health Care
Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, responded that her
agency was making changes to reduce overpayments in the future. But
in a written response to the inspector general, Ms. DeParle
disagreed with the recommendation that she seek legislation
allowing Medicare to recover the excess payments. In effect, she
said, the overpayments help HMOs finance extra benefits for
Medicare patients, and this is apparently what Congress intended.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the chairman of the
Special Committee on Aging, urged the administration to try to
recover the overpayments. ``Can't we get back that money for the
trust fund?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, the national trade group for managed care companies, said:
``HMOs have not done anything wrong. We have followed the rules.
The Medicare payments to HMOs were all reviewed and approved by the
Health Care Financing Administration.''
</P>
<P>
   HMOs say that if the government cuts their payments for
administrative and other costs, it will be more difficult for them
to offer extra benefits, like eye care and prescription drug
coverage, which have attracted elderly people in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, the inspector general, said the overpayments were
cause for concern because of the precarious financial condition of
the Medicare program, which finances health care for more than 38
million people, including 6 million in HMOs. Under current law,
with no action by Congress, the Medicare trust fund is expected to
run out of money in 2008, three years before the first baby boomers
reach the age of 65.
</P>
<P>
   Administrative costs include marketing, taxes and profits,
salaries and fringe benefits for certain executives, rent,
depreciation, interest expenses, data processing, legal fees and
other overhead costs associated with the management and operation
of an HMO.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs get a fixed monthly payment, set in advance, for each
Medicare patient. The payments are based mainly on data that HMOs
submit to the government. Ms. Brown said many HMOs were ``aware
that the amounts that they submit for administration are inaccurate
and result in unjustified expenditures of Medicare funds.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Examining the financial records of HMOs with Medicare contracts
in 1996, Ms. Brown found that Medicare paid 31.7 percent of their
administrative expenses, but accounted for only 8.9 percent of
their enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   For 1994, 1995 and 1996, Ms. Brown said, ``the presently used
methodology allowed HMOs to overestimate their anticipated needs
for administrative costs by as much as $1 billion, $1.3 billion and
$1.9 billion, respectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare payments to HMOs have grown significantly, to $25.6
billion last year from $8.6 billion in 1993. The Congressional
Budget Office predicts that 10 million beneficiaries, or 25 percent
of the Medicare population, will be in HMOs by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is encouraging the trend, in the belief that HMOs can
help control costs in the long run. But some HMOs have pulled out
of the program, saying that Medicare payment rates are inadequate.
United Healthcare Corp., one of the nation's biggest HMOs, took a
$900 million charge against earnings last week, in part to abandon
unprofitable Medicare plans.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeParle, the Medicare administrator, agreed that the
accounting techniques used by HMOs had ``almost certainly resulted
in overstated administrative costs.'' But she expressed concern
about possible cutbacks in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received reports that some HMOs have reduced benefit
levels and increased premiums'' for Medicare patients this year,
she said, and ``it is possible that beneficiaries will again
experience reduced benefit levels'' in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Medicare has operated on the principle that it should
pay its share of costs for various services.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown found that the administrative costs assigned to
Medicare were more than three times the amounts that HMOs charged
to commercial customers, even though ``a large portion of
administrative costs are fixed'' and do not vary with a patient's
age. In 1997, she said, the average monthly HMO premium for
administrative costs was $20.87 for commercial customers and $77.30
for Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   For one HMO, Ms. Brown said, the disparity was ``even more
egregious.'' On its financial statements, she said, this health
plan reported $287 million in administrative expenses, but Medicare
payments for administration totaled $366 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievably,'' Ms. Brown said, ``the Medicare program covered
127 percent of the plan's administrative expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   If Medicare payments to an HMO exceed the cost of the standard
package of benefits, the health plan can use the money to provide
extra benefits like prescription drugs, eye examinations, dental
care and foot care.
</P>
<P>
   But the inspector general said there was some evidence that HMOs
had not provided all the extra benefits they indicated in their
annual reports to the government. And that, she said, is one reason
Medicare officials should try to recover the ``excess payments'' to
HMOs.

EDITORIAL: FREE SPEECH AND PUBLIC SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 11:
</P>
<P>
   The ``Million Youth March'' proposed for Harlem over Labor Day
weekend presents some classic questions about the constitutional
rights of free expression for people with abhorrent views. Khalid
Abdul Muhammad, the march organizer, has a record of outrageous
anti-Semitic rhetoric. He wants to stage his event along Malcolm X
Boulevard in Harlem, an area that New York City's police have
rejected for reasons of traffic and security. Some black leaders
not aligned with Muhammad have nevertheless worried out loud about
censoring people who want to take part in what is being billed as a
march to empower minority youth.
</P>
<P>
   Self-promoting demagogues provide unique challenges to the
American political culture, and that is especially true in diverse
cities like New York. The test is to clearly think through the
situation without being driven to knee-jerk authoritarianism or, at
the other extreme, pandering to outrageous demands that jeopardize
civic harmony or public safety to an unreasonable extent.
</P>
<P>
   The first test here is not to be misled by the word ``march.''
What Muhammad has called a march is actually an extended stationary
rally, which he says will draw thousands or even millions of young
people to hear speeches and listen to music. Although it is
doubtful the organizers are capable of assembling that many people,
the city must take Muhammad at his word for planning purposes. A
busy thoroughfare in central Harlem, which might be appropriate for
a march or parade, is clearly not a suitable site for a day-long
event involving a massive crowd that would create a traffic and
safety nightmare. The Police Department's suggestions of Randalls
Island or Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx do not seem unreasonable.
If they do not suit Muhammad, he has recourse to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Million Man March in Washington, to which Muhammad
obviously wants to draw comparisons, the organizers of the Million
Youth March do not appear to have made serious logistic or security
plans for handling large numbers of people. Every black leader of
any standing who has endorsed a march for Labor Day weekend appears
to be sponsoring a competing event in Atlanta known as the Million
Youth Movement.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad exists on the far fringes of African-American politics,
but when he first announced his march, some of Harlem's political
leaders made attempts to negotiate with him. Given the loathsome
history of Muhammad, who was dismissed by the Rev. Louis Farrakhan
after making a speech in which he called Jews ``bloodsuckers,'' any
interaction that gave him a tinge of credibility was unwise. But
the politicians' concern for the safety of young people who might
be drawn into the event was understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, it has become clear that Muhammad is less
interested in negotiating than in creating confrontation, as he has
in recent years by trafficking in anti-Catholic and homophobic
sound bites. His rhetoric seems likely to attract those so
alienated as to pose the prospect of violence. That means Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani has to be firm but not provocative in his public
statements and in guiding the police preparations for the event.
The other elected leaders who tried to work with Muhammad must make
it clear that they support neither his rhetoric nor his march. It
is also most important that they offer young black people other
opportunities to make their voices heard.

BUDGET AXES THREATENING MAXXAM FOREST DEAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Calif.) 
 
By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Maxxam company's 2-year-old agreement to sell a
stand of ancient redwood trees in Northern California to the
federal and California governments is close to unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   Budget negotiators in Sacramento, Calif., have dropped from the
state's 1999 budget a $130 million appropriation needed to buy
Houston-based Maxxam's Headwaters Forest _ the largest stand of
old-growth redwood trees left in private hands.
</P>
<P>
   That $130 million represents California's share of a $380
million, three-way deal to purchase 5,600 acres of virgin redwood
timberland to serve as the core of a 7,500-acre preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Washington already has allocated the remaining $250 million to
purchase the property from Maxxam's Pacific Lumber Co. subsidiary,
but those federal dollars will disappear if California does not
cough up its share by March.
</P>
<P>
   California's inability to move forward on the Headwaters funding
is causing consternation on three coasts, as negotiators from
Houston to Sacramento to Washington watch years of effort stumble
on the final hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made a lot of compromises in order to get this far,''
said Bob Irelan, a spokesman for Maxxam in Houston. ``We feel the
state has an obligation to fund its share.''
</P>
<P>
   California lawmakers this week will try to craft a new bill that
would include funds to purchase Headwaters. But such a bill would
require a two-thirds vote, and few observers believe supporters can
muster that many votes before the legislature adjourns at the end
of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting two-thirds is going to be extraordinarily difficult,''
said one legislative source.
</P>
<P>
   California lawmakers yanked the $130 million provision from
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson's budget proposal last week because of
opposition from conservationists and conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Many environmentalists object to the legislation because they
believe regulators didn't go far enough to protect wildlife, such
as the coho salmon, when they negotiated the logging guidelines
Pacific Lumber will have to follow for the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not worth taking a fatally flawed habitat conservation
plan in order to buy Headwaters Grove,'' said Paul Mason, president
of the Garberville, Calif.-based Environmental Protection
Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists have lined up behind a bill sponsored by
California Sen. Byron Sher, the dean of California's
environmentalist bloc, that would impose greater restrictions on
Pacific Lumber's ability to log near streams.
</P>
<P>
   Maxxam officials vehemently opposed that legislation, arguing it
would double the acreage put off limits because of environmental
concerns and prevent Pacific Lumber from being economically viable.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives are opposed to the notion of the state and federal
governments' buying up privately held land.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those divergent viewpoints, lawmakers such as Mike
Thompson, chairman of the Senate budget committee and a state
senator from Pacific Lumber territory, hasn't given up hope of
finding a compromise that would, as legislative director Ruth
Coleman said, ``protect these trees in a way that allows the
company to operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who was instrumental two years
ago in helping to negotiate the Headwaters deal, had her staff on
the phone all weekend with lawmakers in Sacramento, trying to
figure out a way to salvage the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still hopeful an agreement can be reached,'' said
Howard Gantman, a spokesman for Feinstein. ``We feel it would be a
loss of a tremendous resource if the deal doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Jill Ratner president of the Rose Foundation, an Oakland,
Calif.-based environmental group, argued ``there has to be a reason
for legislators to feel it's worth it for them to vote to spend
$130 million, which even in California's budget is a lot of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the money to pay its share of the Headwaters purchase
price has never been an easy issue for California.
</P>
<P>
   When the Headwaters deal was finally hammered out in September
1996 after months of painstaking negotiations, California offered
to allow Maxxam to choose from among 51 state-owned properties,
ranging from a old bus station in San Francisco to a canine
training facility in South Lake Tahoe.
</P>
<P>
   Other properties included a rock quarry, an earthquake-damaged
building and land adjacent to a state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Maxxam, however, held out for cash and timberland.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Headwaters agreement, the federal and California
governments would pay Maxxam $300 million in cash. The governments
also would purchase 9,600 acres of previously logged timberland
from another party and turn 7,700 acres of that land over to Maxxam
for logging.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 1,900 acres would serve as a buffer zone for
Headwaters and the smaller Elk Head Springs virgin redwood grove.
</P>
<P>
   If California lawmakers cannot reach an agreement this month,
they can return to the issue next January, when a new legislature
convenes. But supporters of the agreement worry that a new
legislature, with fresh faces and new priorities, will not be able
to make the Headwaters agreement a priority.
</P>
<P>
   And they fear if California misses this window of opportunity,
all hope of obtaining federal funds again will be lost. Feinstein,
in a letter sent to Wilson last month, warned: ``The federal money
will clearly be taken away and spent elsewhere by a Republican
majority in Congress who feel that Californians cannot get their
act together.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, in a letter to Feinstein,
warned that the federal government will not be able to protect the
Headwaters Forest without an outright purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failure of the state of California to provide its share of
funds for the purchase and permanent set-aside of the Headwaters
Forest will result in an irretrievable and tragic loss,'' Babbitt
said.

TELEPHONE STRIKE TALKS ALSO FOCUS ON 1,500 SUBSIDIARIES' WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Bell Atlantic continued to negotiate on Monday
with the union that represents the company's 73,000 striking
workers, the talks focused in part on two of the telephone giant's
small but fast-growing subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The two units employ only about 1,500 of the company's 141,000
workers; but for both the union and the company, the small
operations represent the future of Bell Atlantic and of the
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidiaries provide advanced data communications, including
access to the Internet, to corporate customers and bundles of
services like caller ID and wireless phone service to consumers.
None of the Bell Atlantic employees at either unit are represented
by a union; the striking union, the Communications Workers of
America, wants to change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``These subsidiaries may not be that labor-intensive now, but
these are the growth areas and we are concerned whether that will
be union work,'' said Jeffrey Miller, a union spokesman in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, based in New York, declined to discuss the units
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways the importance of the two units reflects the
evolution of the telecommunications business. Phone companies
around the nation are scrambling to keep up with far-reaching
regulatory changes and waves of multibillion-dollar mergers that
are changing the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell Atlantic is at a difficult crossroads here because their
competitors in most cases don't have to hire union workers,'' said
Eric Strumingher, a telecommunications-industry analyst at Paine
Webber. ``They want to be in these growth sectors, but they need to
have a lean cost structure to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   One subsidiary, Bell Atlantic Network Integration, was formed
about five years ago with fewer than 100 employees. In 1995, the
last time Bell Atlantic and the communications workers union
negotiated a contract, the operation was still small enough to
escape serious scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the unit employs around 750 people and is growing quickly,
with contracts to maintain complex data networks for big companies,
including US Airways. Bell Atlantic calls all of the unit's workers
management employees, so they are not represented by the union.
</P>
<P>
   The union mainly wants to represent the unit's workers who
install communications wiring inside buildings, a person involved
in the talks said on Monday. That person said it was likely that
the two sides would reach an agreement that would allow the union
to represent some of those employees.
</P>
<P>
   The other unit, Bell Atlantic Plus, in Hampton, Va., sells
services to residential customers. Bell Atlantic started the unit
several years ago. Partly because of complex regulations then in
place, the company hired all of the unit's workers, mostly customer
service representatives, through a Boston company called the
Faneuil Group.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the regulations have eased, the union wants to
represent those workers. The Faneuil Group employees make about $7
an hour; comparable union jobs would pay about $15 an hour.

MAN SHOT TO DEATH NEAR BRIDGEPORT COURTHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. _ A 21-year-old man was shot to death on
Monday in front of the state courthouse here after being attacked
by a group of young men, witnesses and the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Dante Jones of Bridgeport, was pronounced dead on
arrival with a gunshot wound to the abdomen early Monday afternoon
at Bridgeport Hospital, said John Cappiello, the hospital
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. David Boston of the Bridgeport police said Jones had
dropped off someone at Superior Court in Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, a fight broke out on the steps leading to
the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just erupted all of a sudden,'' Boston said. ``It got
violent _ there were blows thrown. They tumbled down the steps and
someone pulled out a gun and shot the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said a group of four or five young men surrounded
Jones, kicking and hitting him until he fell to the ground on
Golden Hill Street in front of the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The beating lasted a few minutes, said Eddie Gonzalez, a state
child-support enforcement officer who watched it from a third-floor
window of the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were ganging up on him, they were kicking and hitting
him, and then I heard five or six shots,'' added Gonzalez, who did
not see the gun or who fired it.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that sheriffs came rushing out of the building as
the young men ran away. Hector Gonzalez, 17, who is no relation to
Eddie Gonzalez, said he saw the sheriffs come back with one young
man in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   But Sgt. Brian Meraviglia of the state police major crime squad
said this evening that the police had no one in custody, no
suspects and no motive, though they ``had a lot of witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones worked for United Parcel Service and had turned 21 last
week, according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   James Vine, 32, of Bridgeport said Jones lived with his mother
in the city's East End and ``was a nice kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was a graduate of Harding High School, said another
neighbor, Mike Horan, 23.
</P>
<P>
   E. Paul Haringa, a lawyer, said he was in the building, talking
to a client's family outside a courtroom, when he heard the shots
fired outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``People started streaming out of the courtroom, and the
sheriffs ran for the door,'' Haringa said. He said that he went to
a window to watch and that he saw the sheriffs seize one of the men
involved in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw sheriffs bring the man inside the courthouse in
handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   The police shut the front doors of the courthouse for about 10
minutes after the shooting and began letting people out the side
doors as they roped off the crime scene, Haringa said.

 METS NOTEBOOK: WAIVER DEAL PUTS QUESTION TO REST; WILSON IS NOT
LEAVING; LEAGUE REJECTS A PROTEST; McMICHAEL REJOINS THE TEAM  
(lb) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Over the weekend in Denver, Brian McRae wondered who
would spell him in center field if he needed a day off down the
stretch. Not that McRae wanted one. He just wondered who it would
be, considering that the other New York Mets outfielders were more
comfortable playing the corners.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, General Manager Steve Phillips addressed the issue in
a waiver-wire deal when he acquired 27-year-old Jermaine
Allensworth from the Kansas City Royals for a player to be
determined by Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives us some speed in either a complementary or main
role,'' Phillips said Monday from Port St. Lucie, Fla. ``He also
gives us the depth to give Brian a blow, considering that Brian's
played every day.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time Allensworth has been traded this season.
He began the season with the Pittsburgh Pirates and batted .309
with eight stolen bases in 69 games. The Royals acquired him on
June 27 for Manuel Bernal, who was pitching for the Mexico City
Reds. With Kansas City, Allensworth batted .205 with seven stolen
bases in 30 games. But he was three for his last 26 and was playing
sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see him as a starter right now for this team,''
Manager Bobby Valentine said before the Mets played the Cardinals
Monday night. ``We obviously have had a situation where we need an
outfielder who can play defense ever since the All-Star break, and
we've needed them almost every day. We've put Lenny Harris out
there and that has taken away one of our best pinch-hitters and
left the team a little strapped. Someone to pinch-run late in the
game has also been a need.''
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Allensworth on their 40-man roster, the Mets
designated for assignment Benny Agbayani, who was playing outfield
and first base at Class AAA Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   An educated guess would be that Allensworth will replace catcher
Todd Pratt, who has bounced between the Mets and Norfolk this
season, on the 25-man roster. Allensworth was not expected to join
the Mets until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he tried to obtain Allensworth from the Pirates
before the player was traded to Kansas City. Shortly before the
July 31 non-waiver deadline, the Mets had scouted Allensworth
heavily, but apparently did not offer Kansas City General Manager
Herk Robinson what he wanted. The Royals need pitching and a middle
infielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The player we're getting wasn't available at an earlier
date,'' Robinson said. ``I feel like we're getting a quality player
in return.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson Is Not Leaving
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wilson is one person that two members of the Mets'
organization said would not be the remaining part of the Jermaine
Allensworth trade. Wilson, the No. 1 overall pick in the 1994
draft, has just progressed from arm troubles back to Class AAA
Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander pitched six shutout innings last Thursday in
his Norfolk debut and is scheduled to make his next start Wednesday
in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is progressing faster than the Mets' top hitting
prospect, Jay Payton, who is back playing the outfield and a little
first base after being troubled by hamstring injuries. Payton is
batting .244 at Norfolk with 11 stolen bases, but has not stolen a
base since an extended stay on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Allensworth figures to be with the Mets at least until Butch
Huskey (strained left hamstring) comes off the 15-day disabled
list, on which he was placed Aug. 3. Huskey took early batting
practice Monday and hopes to do so again Tuesday. But the Mets
conceivably could wait until after double-headers at Shea Stadium,
Aug. 20-21, to activate Huskey. They could either move a pitcher _
the Mets are carrying 12 _ or send Allensworth, who has options
left, to Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   League Rejects a Protest
</P>
<P>
   National League President Leonard Coleman denied the Mets'
protest of their 4-3 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers at Shea on
July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had argued that the Dodgers submitted an inaccurate
lineup card, listing Wilton Guerrero at second base and Tripp
Cromer as a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers then activated Eric Young from the disabled list and
put Cromer on it, before announcing the trade of Guerrero during
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that the requirements of the League Constitution were
met,'' Coleman stated in his written decision. ``The Home Plate
umpire, the on-field League Representative, was informed prior to
the commencement of the game of the changes and the Mets were
similarly informed ... as was the press box.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman also invoked an interpretation of Rule 4.01. ``As the
Rule contemplates `teams should not be trapped later by some
mistake that obviously was inadvertent and which can be corrected
before the game starts.'''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine expressed disappointment with the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trade wasn't made at game time,'' Valentine said. ``They
were not being trapped. The trade was made well after that. I think
it's an incorrect decision. Obviously the rules we're supposed to
abide by don't mean anything.''

<P>
   They are a rarefied roster of not quite two dozen, the men and
women who have served as independent counsels investigating high
government officials over the last 20 years. They have delved into
accusations of everything from cocaine use by a senior White House
aide to perjury, influence-peddling and favor-trading, and have
produced decidedly mixed results, from no indictments to
convictions to reversals on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them have been harshly criticized for taking too long,
spending too much or seeking to criminalize conduct that is rarely
prosecuted. But as Kenneth Starr's investigation of President
Clinton has moved from scrutiny of a tangled real estate investment
to intimations of intimacy with an intern, the law that created
independent counsels has come under attack as almost never before.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews in the last week with seven of the people who have
held the job since that law, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978,
was adopted in the wake of Watergate produced broad consensus that
the statute was needed but might have to be overhauled if it was to
be renewed by Congress when it expires next year.
</P>
<P>
   The former counsels were unanimous on one point: All were glad
to have served. But a majority also said that as currently written,
the law covered too many officials and too many potential acts of
wrongdoing, and left the attorney general too little discretion
about when to invoke it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be limited to activities that occur in office,''
said Lawrence Walsh, who spent six years and $40 million
investigating the Iran-contra affair and whose suggestions for
changes were among the most sweeping. ``It should be limited to
misuse of government power and should not include personal mistakes
or indiscretions. The enormous expense of an independent counsel's
investigation and the disruption of the presidency should not be
inflicted except for something in which there was a misuse of
power. That's not out of consideration for the individual; it's out
of consideration for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the former counsels generally declined to comment on
Starr's investigation, virtually all of them also said that wide
experience as a criminal prosecutor or a defense lawyer _
experience that Starr does not have _ should be a requirement for
the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe strongly in the concept of an independent counsel to
guarantee public confidence in the impartiality of any criminal
investigation into conduct of top officials in the executive branch
of our government,'' said Whitney North Seymour Jr., who won a
perjury conviction against Michael Deaver, a former top aide to
President Reagan who was accused of lying about his lobbying
activities after leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' Seymour continued, in comments generally echoed by
his colleagues, ``appointments to that position should be limited
to lawyers with proven good judgment and extensive prior experience
in gathering admissible evidence, developing corroboration and
satisfying the trial standard of reasonable doubt. We simply cannot
afford the spectacle of on-the-job-training in such a sensitive
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Arthur Christy was appointed in 1979 to investigate
accusations that Hamilton Jordan, President Carter's White House
chief of staff, had used cocaine at Studio 54 _ a case that ended
with no indictments _ there have been a total of 20
independent-counsel investigations, some conducted by more than one
prosecutor. The names of the targets of two investigations in the
Bush era, and the counsels who conducted them, were sealed by court
order. One investigator, Robert Fiske Jr., was appointed by
Attorney General Janet Reno in 1994, at a time when the law had
expired, and was replaced four years ago last week by a three-judge
federal panel that chose Starr instead, but Fiske had essentially
all the same powers.
</P>
<P>
   Five investigations of Clinton administration officials,
including Starr's, are still pending, and Ms. Reno remains under
intense pressure to ask the judicial panel for yet another
prosecutor, to look into campaign finance abuses. No effort was
made to interview those conducting active investigations, or the
counsel who ended his investigation of Commerce Secretary Ronald
Brown after Brown's death in a plane crash in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A common theme in the remarks of the seven former counsels who
agreed to be interviewed was the momentous power and isolation of
the job, a parallel universe of solitude and solemn responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of individual power, I never had anything like
this,'' said Walsh, who had served as a federal district judge and,
in the Eisenhower administration, deputy attorney general. ``Night
after night, I'd wake up in the middle of the night. I kept a
notebook by my bed, and the only way I could get back to sleep was
to write down whatever was bothering me. I'd worry about my travel
expenses, thinking, `This is going to seem very high.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fiske forsook the companionship of the only four friends he knew
he Little Rock, Ark., who all happened to be leading lawyers there,
when he set up shop to investigate Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   Scholarly critics of the independent counsel law, including a
Supreme Court justice, Antonin Scalia, have argued that it creates
built-in incentives for prosecutors to pursue evidence and avenues
of inquiry that law-enforcement officials might otherwise decide
were never likely to bear fruit. The incentives: simply the intense
political pressure and public scrutiny that surround any
appointment, and the requirement that the prosecutor produce a
detailed public report justifying the findings.
</P>
<P>
   That concern was also common among the former prosecutors
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ought to be some way to limit the ability of an
independent counsel to expand his or her investigation, to keep
their eye on the original target they were initially appointed to
investigate,'' said James McKay, whose conviction of Lyn Nofziger,
a former Reagan aide charged with violating ethics laws on
lobbying, was overturned on appeal after an inquiry that lasted 14
months and cost $3 million. ``When you think of how the Starr
investigation started with Fiske and Whitewater and now what's
become of it, it just seems that there should be some way to have
prevented that from occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Di Genova, who ultimately brought no charges after a
three-year, $2.2 million investigation into accusations that senior
Bush administration officials improperly sought information from
Bill Clinton's passport files during the 1992 campaign, was the
sole former prosecutor to condemn the law altogether, and he said
it should not be renewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the usual governors, both legal and practical, are
absent, because of the special nature of the statute,'' said
DiGenova, who argues that once the law is invoked, prosecutors are
forced to bring ``an unnatural degree of targeted attention'' to
the case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fiske, who like Walsh and DiGenova thinks any law should cover
investigation of only the president, the vice president and the
attorney general rather than the 75 or so senior government and
party officials now automatically covered, also worries about the
potential for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the person is selected, it's like recalling a missile,''
Fiske said. ``You can't recall it, and it's kind of unguided,
except by its own. And so all these things are judgment calls.''
</P>
<P>
   But like his colleagues, Fiske emphasized that a prosecutor
ultimately had wide discretion over what to pursue, and he recalled
that after David Hale, a former municipal judge in Arkansas, had
pleaded guilty and begun cooperating in the Whitewater case, he
provided much useful information, along with accusations that
seemed far afield.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of other things that David Hale told us that
we could have investigated under our charter,'' he recounted ``but
I just said, `This is too far removed from what we were supposed to
be doing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the prosecutors expressed concern that the current
law led too easily to the appointment of independent counsels.
Every time the attorney general receives ``specific and credible''
allegations of wrongdoing by an official covered under the act, she
has 30 days to decide, without compelling anyone's testimony,
whether a preliminary investigation is warranted. If she concludes
that it is, then she must decide within 90 days whether there are
``reasonable grounds'' to believe that further investigation is
warranted. If there are, she must apply to the special three-judge
court for appointment of an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That time limit now is too brief,'' McKay said.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the former prosecutors, who spoke only on the
condition of anonymity, said that the law was sound as written and
that complaints that it invited prosecutorial vendettas were
overblown. Seymour also rejected complaints of unbridled power,
saying he had had no more leeway as independent counsel than he had
earlier had as U.S. attorney in Manhattan in the Nixon
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States attorney for the Southern District has
almost unlimited power,'' Seymour said. ``How the responsibility is
carried out is another question.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly another former independent counsel, Alexia Morrison,
said that the law did not need any major changes and that ``there's
been a very successful campaign to lay faults at the foot of the
statute when in fact it is conduct that got us here.'' Asked
whether she meant conduct by Clinton, Starr or both, Ms. Morrison
simply repeated her assertion.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ms. Morrison's investigation into whether Theodore Olson,
an assistant attorney general in the Reagan administration, misled
Congress in a dispute over toxic waste cleanup that led to the 1988
Supreme Court ruling upholding the independent counsel law. And
though she ultimately brought no charges after a 30-month, $1.5
million investigation, she, like many of her colleagues, said that
very result underscored one of the most important features of the
law, because it enhanced the public's confidence that nothing had
been covered up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a heck of a lot of very troublesome investigations
that have been resolved without bringing any criminal charges,''
Ms. Morrison said, ``and there was not a situation in which anyone
came back and said, `That's outrageous.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fiske, too, said that in the absence of such a law, there would
seldom be significant public controversy if high officials were
charged and brought to trial, whatever the outcome, but that ``the
problem is when the case isn't brought'' because a prosecutor
decides there is not enough evidence or likelihood of success. ``In
many respects,'' he said, ``that is where you need the independent
counsel most of all.''
</P>
<P>
   But for alleged misdeeds that may have occurred before a senior
official took office, Walsh and Ms. Morrison said, the solution
should be to extend the statute of limitations for any such crimes
and investigate after the official leaves office, though Ms.
Morrison acknowledged that this could pose its own problems, in
terms of stale evidence or lost witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In one way or another, all the former counsels who were
interviewed deplored the partisanship now surrounding an office
that grew out of bipartisan concern over Nixon's ``Saturday night
massacre'' of the first Watergate special prosecutor, Archibald
Cox, and the two highest officials of the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become so politicized now,'' McKay said, ``that the ins
hate it and the outs love it just for the purpose of bringing the
ins down. That's the part that will turn the public sour.''
</P>
<P>
   Seymour agreed, saying: ``It plainly has gotten a bad name. And
that comes from the public perception of recent events, and I think
that's unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   DiGenova contended that Cox's dismissal was the exception that
proved the rule, particularly since the Watergate inquiry continued
under additional until Nixon's downfall. ``There's no way that a
sitting president can possibly prevent his own investigation by
firing anybody, because the political process will not permit it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morrison said it remained unclear whether the public would
continue to support the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of the previous independent counsels have been
able to achieve a result with a general sense of public confidence
that the way they got there was appropriate,'' she said. ``But hold
your breath. It may be that Starr can spin out a report that tells
an incredibly interesting tale that puts the lie to most of the
procedural and substantive assaults on him. On the other hand, if
it looks like he hasn't produced so much, and has used an elephant
gun on a flea, then maybe that won't be so well regarded.''

 JESS PRESENT, 77, NEW YORK STATE SENATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ State Sen. Jess Joseph Present, a Republican leader
from upstate New York who spent more than three decades in the
state legislature, died on Saturday at his home in Bemus Point,
N.Y., near his native Jamestown. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   A heart attack was the apparent cause, the Senate press office
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election to the Senate from Chautauqua County, in
southwestern New York, Present had filled a string of important
committee assignments. But his influence fell victim to party
infighting in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   He was closely allied with Ralph Marino, the majority leader
from Oyster Bay, who was a rival to his fellow Senator, George
Pataki, from Peekskill. Marino chose Present as his deputy majority
leader in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   With Pataki moving into the governor's office after the 1994
election, Sen. Joseph Bruno of Rensselaer County engineered
Marino's ouster and succeeded him as majority leader. In January,
Bruno named a new deputy, and Present retired from that post.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, Present was chairman of the Senate Commerce,
Economic Development and Small Business Committee and a member of
the National Legislatures' Committee on Commerce, Labor and
Economic Development. His 56th Senate District covers Chautauqua,
Allegany, Livingston and Cattaraugus counties.
</P>
<P>
   Present faced a scare in the 1992 election when it initially
appeared that he had lost his seat to a Democrat, but the completed
count of absentee ballots returned him to Albany once again with
just 190 votes to spare. The last time around, in 1996, he sailed
past his Democratic challenger with a winning vote of 69 percent to
31.
</P>
<P>
   Present attended Allegheny College but enlisted in World War II
to serve with the Eighth Air Force in England. After the war, he
worked in a family jewelry business in Jamestown.
</P>
<P>
   He started his political career in 1960 as a Jamestown City
Councilman, serving until 1963. He represented the Jamestown area
in the State Assembly from 1965 until he was elected in 1968 to the
State Senate, where he concentrated on commerce and education. He
was a past chairman of the Chautauqua County Republican Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Elaine Coates Present; two sons,
Jeffrey B. and Randall L., both of Bemus Point; two brothers,
William E., of Lakewood, N.Y., and Leonard R., of West Bloomfield,
Mich; a sister, Anna Rae, also of Bemus Point; and three
grandchildren.

JUDGE SAYS COSMETIC CHANGES MAY NOT KEEP SEX SHOPS OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an interpretation that could bolster New York
City's move to shut down sex shops, a state Supreme Court justice
warned on Monday that efforts by shop owners to reduce their
adult-entertainment stock would not automatically exempt them from
new zoning laws.
</P>
<P>
   Since the law went into effect on July 22, sex shop owners have
been scrambling to comply with the new zoning law by reducing to 40
percent their stock of adult-entertainment wares.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Stephen Crane said shops could be judged by the
percentage of their revenue derived from adult entertainment and by
whether the majority of their patrons were in search of adult
products. He said that the standard for judging shops could not
``just be a mechanical formula'' and that the standard ``should be
a practical and common-sensical one.''
</P>
<P>
   Crane's comments came in a hearing at which he bitterly accused
the owners of the Harmony Theater in the Chelsea section in
Manhattan of instituting merely cosmetic changes to circumvent the
law and ordered the theater padlocked. Making little effort to hide
his anger, Crane dismissed an effort by the strip club to restrict
nude dancing to an area behind a set of portable Japanese shoji
screens as a way to no longer be considered an adult establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is transparent,'' Crane said. ``It is the rankest effort.
It offends me deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   While his ruling was directed at the Harmony Theater, Crane's
comments earlier in the day extended to the 144 sex shops affected
by the law. He indicated that expensive and extensive efforts on
their part to avoid violating the law might also prove futile.
</P>
<P>
   The justice, who carried out a personal, impromptu inspection of
the Show World sex emporium in Times Square on Friday afternoon,
said he would use a ``common sense'' standard to determine whether
a business was a sex shop.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a vaguely worded section of the new law that is the
primary remaining hope of the stores and strip clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 measure, which prohibits sex shops in residential areas
or within 500 feet of schools, churches or each other, defines a
sex shop as a business that devotes a ``substantial portion'' of
its floor space or stock to adult products. The Giuliani
administration included the phrase in the law to avoid having it
declared an unconstitutional ban on free speech. In Federal court
in July, the city's Department of Buildings defined a ``substantial
portion'' of a business as more than 40 percent of a store's floor
space.
</P>
<P>
   Herald Price Fahringer, the lawyer representing 107 of the 144
sex shops affected, seized on the formula, apparently advising
dozens of his clients to devote 60 percent of their stock to
products like perfume, souvenirs and general-audience videos.
Fahringer, citing the city's own interpretation of the law, has
argued that sex shops that devote less than 40 percent of their
floor space to adult products could no longer be defined as adult
establishments.
</P>
<P>
   But Crane, extensively commenting on the issue for the first
time on Monday, dismissed that argument, saying that unless
Fahringer could convince him otherwise, he was not bound by the
40-60 formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really capture the essence of `substantial
portion,''' the justice said. ``Substantial portion can't just be a
mechanical formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Connolly, the lawyer arguing the case on behalf of the
city, praised that interpretation. But Fahringer accused the city
of unfairly shifting the ground rules and warned that if Crane
closed X-rated businesses based on his broader interpretation, the
sex shops would have grounds for an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of test cases, the Giuliani administration asked
Crane to close three Manhattan strip clubs, including the Harmony,
and three Manhattan adult video stores. The order to padlock the
Harmony on Monday was the first time the new zoning law alone had
been used to padlock a Manhattan strip club.

RAYMOND BROWN, 70, A LEADING BIBLICAL SCHOLAR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (ll) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Raymond Brown, an internationally influential Roman
Catholic biblical scholar who taught at the Union Theological
Seminary for two decades, died on Saturday in Sequoia Hospital in
Redwood City, Calif. He was 70 and lived in Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said the Rev. Ronald Witherup,
provincial of the Society of St. Sulpice, a fellowship of priests
who teach in seminaries, of which Brown was a member.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose scholarly career spanned four decades, was the
author of nearly 40 books, many of them commentaries on the New
Testament, including detailed studies of the Gospel accounts of
Jesus' birth and death. The first Catholic in a tenured position at
Union, a historically Protestant institution, Brown taught there
from 1971 until his retirement in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In the contentious field of biblical studies, which ranges from
biblical literalists to those who have tried to strip down the New
Testament texts to seek out a historical figure of Jesus, Brown was
regarded as a centrist, with a reputation as a man of the church
and a rigorous, exacting scholar whose work had to be reckoned
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot fault him on a single footnote, and he wrote
thousands,'' said James A. Sanders, a former colleague of Brown at
Union who recently retired as a professor at Claremont School of
Theology in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say,'' Sanders added, ``that his basic position was
that the Gospel accounts are, yes, products of the church, but they
are basically trustworthy,'' from a broadly historical point of
view.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Brown had become concerned about the public
attention drawn to some scholarship, like that produced by members
of the Jesus Seminar, that questioned whether the biblical accounts
of Jesus' life and teachings embraced historical truth about Jesus
or were the largely the product of early Christian theologians'
writing decades after the crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   One of Brown's responses was to write ``An Introduction to the
New Testament'' (Doubleday, 1996), in which he declared he wanted
to inform general readers where most biblical scholars stood, apart
from what he called ``new and bold theses'' that drew the attention
of the news media.
</P>
<P>
   One of his former doctoral students, Marion L. Soards, said the
book was a major effort ``to try to bring some balance and
direction'' to biblical studies. Soards, who teaches the New
Testament at the Louisville Theological Seminary, recalled Brown as
a model lecturer whose classroom presentations were so carefully
prepared he could bring them to ``a perfect conclusion'' seconds
before the bell signaled the end of class.
</P>
<P>
   Brown first went to Union as a visiting professor in 1967,
became a permanent faculty member in 1971, and was appointed Auburn
Professor of Biblical Studies in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Both Soards and Sanders said Brown, who never lectured without
his clerical collar, possessed a pastoral presence, encouraging to
his students. Rather than being someone who pursued scholarship for
its own sake, Soards said, ``Ray understood himself to be a priest,
and he understood himself to be in service to Christ and the
church.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was born in New York City on May 22, 1928. He received
bachelor's and master's degrees from Catholic University of America
in Washington, a doctorate in sacred theology from St. Mary's
Seminary in Baltimore and a doctorate in Semitic languages from
Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the first Catholic scholars to take advantage of a
new openness within the Catholic church to critical biblical
studies, a profoundly important development that followed Pope Pius
XII's 1943 encyclical ``Divino Afflante Spiritu,'' which allowed
scholars to use critical methods to study the sources and
historical contexts of the Bible's books.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was ordained in 1953 in the Diocese of St. Augustine, Fla.
and in 1963 served as an adviser to his bishop at the Second
Vatican Council.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, he received academic and church
distinctions, including more than 25 honorary doctorates. At
different times, he served as president of the Catholic Biblical
Association of America, the Society of Biblical Literature and the
International Society of New Testament Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was respected as a major figure in biblical studies in most
denominations,'' said Witherup, until recently the academic dean at
St. Patrick's Seminary in Menlo Park, where Brown lived after his
retirement from Union. Witherup recalled Brown as ``a master
communicator.''
</P>
<P>
   As in his writing, a part of Brown's speaking was devoted to
reaching an audience of interested lay people. In March 1994, he
gave a public lecture at a Presbyterian church in Ridgewood, N.J.,
about his research into the biblical accounts of Jesus'
crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday had just published his two-volume study, ``The Death
of the Messiah,'' in which he discussed the differences in the four
Gospels' accounts of Jesus' death. In his lecture, Brown asked his
audience to understand that those accounts were each built around a
central, historical memory of Jesus' last days.
</P>
<P>
   It was a way of pointing believers toward a critical
understanding of the Passion stories that steered clear of
fundamentalism and also of a view of the Gospels as unhistorical.
One man attending the lecture told a reporter afterward that he had
come ``thirsty for an affirmation of my faith'' and ``drank in
every word'' that Brown spoke.
</P>
<P>
   With Brown's books, articles and lectures in mind, Witherup
said: ``His impact is still going to be widely felt, but his
presence will be missed.''

FOR DECORATORS, BUSINESS AS USUAL  
 A 2ND LEGAL FRONT IN SUIT OVER BOOK  
 BLACKOUTS, IN SYNC

   NEW YORK _ When the name in a one-name design firm dies, what
becomes of the firm?
</P>
<P>
   The question arose after the death last month of the interior
decorator Mark Hampton, who was sought after for his crisp but
comfortable traditionalism. Several New York antiques dealers had
said that the decorators who worked at the Hampton firm had been
taking on outside projects even before he died. They had his
permission, the dealers said, but the arrangement left the
impression that the firm would not continue after his death and
that the decorators would strike out on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe not. Hampton's widow Duane, who said last
month that no decisions about the future of the firm had been made,
issued a statement Monday that signaled that the firm is not
closing its doors. ``In answer to the question, `Is Mark Hampton
still in business?' Duane Hampton replies: `Most emphatically yes!'
'' The statement went on to say that the decorators, draftsmen and
architects who had worked for Hampton ``are completing jobs already
under way and undertaking new business.''
</P>
<P>
   A 2nd Legal Front in Suit Over Book
</P>
<P>
   New YORK _ Hector Feliciano, who wrote a book that traced the
fate of artwork looted by the Nazis, only to be sued in France by
the family of the art dealer Alec Wildenstein, has another lawyer,
and Feliciano credits Ronald Lauder, the cosmetics executive and
collector, with the referral. Louis Begley, a partner at Debevoise
&AMP; Plimpton, said that he would advise Feliciano, even though
Feliciano already has a lawyer in France. (A lawyer for the
Wildensteins said last week that the case involved, in effect,
damage to the Wildensteins' reputation in Feliciano's book, ``The
Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest
Works of Art.'')
</P>
<P>
   Begley would not say who was paying his fees. ``I haven't done
anything I need to be paid for yet,'' he said. ``I know that Hector
knows Ronald Lauder, and I know Ronald Lauder. I believe that
Ronald Lauder told him it was a good idea to come to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackouts, in Sync
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy theorists who love classical music can try to make
something of this: Two summer music festivals 1,853 miles apart had
power failures over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The lights went out at the Bridgehampton Chamber Music
Festival's gala at the Atlantic, a country club in Bridgehampton,
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were downstairs warming up,'' said Marya Martin, the
artistic director and flutist. ``We noticed that the
air-conditioning was off, which was no big deal. It wasn't until
everyone gathered in the performance room until we realized the
lights were off and we were ready to walk on, and it was dark. We
couldn't have read the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Club members, who pay substantial entrance fees when
they join, were scrambling to find torches or candles when the
lights came on again, and the concert began.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe Opera in New Mexico was well into the first act of
``The Magic Flute'' by Mozart, with Raymond Very, Thomas Barrett,
Sheri Greenwald, Joseph Gayer and Anne-Marie Owens singing a
quintet, when the lights went out on the stage and in the orchestra
pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The orchestra knows the opera so well, they just kept
playing,'' said the conductor, Robert Spano, adding that the Santa
Fe Opera had just installed a new emergency power system. ``This
was its first test, and it worked very well,'' he said. ``It's
meant to take seven seconds to turn on, and I'm told it did. It
felt like seven years to me.''

GIANTS' RUNNER HOPES TO STICK AROUND FOR A BIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas)  (ll) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gary Brown is still feeling his way around the
Giants' training camp and his third team in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be unfair to term Brown a journeyman, not after he
rushed for 1,002 yards with an American Football Conference-best
5.1 yards a carry with the Houston Oilers in 1993, and not after he
accumulated 945 yards on the ground for the San Diego Chargers last
season.
</P>
<P>
   But even Brown is unsure just how he has been unable to find a
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, because you see guys who have had success and they
seem to stay with the same team for years,'' Brown said after a
recent morning practice. ``But that wasn't my thing, so I just have
to go out and make the best of my situation. Hopefully, I can play
well again this year. I look forward to playing well this year, and
then maybe I can play here for a couple more years and maybe even
retire here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants would be pleased to see Brown, a 29-year-old running
back out of Penn State, find a home. They signed him to a one-year,
$400,000 contract as an unrestricted free agent on April 21 after
making their way through the draft without finding a running back.
</P>
<P>
   With Rodney Hampton gone, Brown, with his strength and skill
running between the tackles, could became the primary running back.
In the Giants' exhibition opener Saturday night, Brown ran for 19
yards on 10 carries in a 24-17 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals.
Brown was operating behind the second-team offensive line, which
has had trouble opening holes for the running backs.
</P>
<P>
   There are disappointments scattered throughout Brown's story. An
eighth-round draft pick of the Oilers in 1991, he carried the ball
only 27 times in his first two seasons and had only 16 carries in
the first eight games in 1993 before an injury to a teammate
provided him with his first start. Brown responded with 166 yards
rushing. He followed that with a 194-yard performance the next week
against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   But he slid to 648 yards rushing in 1994 and to 293 the next
year. Overweight, overconfident and undermotivated, he was waived
by the Oilers in April 1996. Brown sat home and sulked, ballooning
to nearly 40 pounds over his playing weight of 225 pounds. When the
season began, he was at home in Williamsport, Pa. He remained there
in a funk all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sat around the house,'' Brown said. ``I took the wrong
attitude. I blamed the Oilers. I'd sit around watching TV and
eating. Finally, I was watching the AFC playoff games and I
realized I wanted to be back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown made it back last season, signing with the Chargers and
compiling another successful season. But in the final game of the
season, one that Brown does not enjoy talking about, he was kept on
the bench against his wishes, falling short of the 1,000-yard
plateau and a $200,000 bonus. When the Chargers re-signed Natrone
Means, Brown realized his days were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The San Diego thing is something I had no control over,''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown put opportunity ahead of money to sign with the Giants,
believing that he can earn playing time in a backfield already
crowded with Tiki Barber, Tyrone Wheatley and Charles Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I proved myself,'' Brown said. ``I think at this
point I wanted to be in a good situation where I can go out and
just continue to do the things I can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to learn. If I just go out and play hard and do the
things I do, that's the only thing I can control.''

YANKS BEAT TWINS, 7-3, FOR FIFTH STRAIGHT WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a longtime player and coach with the Yankees,
Frank Crosetti called Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle
teammates, and when Crosetti counseled Joe Torre in Oakland last
week, the Yankees' manager listened. After all, Torre said,
Crosetti has enough World Series rings for all his toes and
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let those guys relax, Crosetti told Torre, whose team is
running away from the American League and toward history. Don't let
them relax.
</P>
<P>
   Relating the story on Monday, Torre shrugged: He does not
believe it's within the nature of his team to relax. The Yankees
won their fifth consecutive game Monday night, crushing the
Minnesota Twins, 7-3, before 29,600 at Yankee Stadium. They are
85-29, and if they merely win half of their remaining 48 games,
they will match the record of the 1961 Yankees (109-53).
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu (11-5) surrendered just two hits in seven innings;
in his last two starts, he has allowed four hits in 15 innings.
Irabu pitched a no-hitter for four innings Monday night, extending
the Yankees' streak of hitless innings against Minnesota to 14,
before Marty Cordova led off the fifth inning with a single. The
Twins had last played against the Yankees on May 17, when David
Wells pitched a perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are far ahead of the Boston Red Sox in the AL East,
17{ games, and they could clinch a playoff spot during their next
road trip. No one is going to catch them during the regular season,
and yet they are playing each game with a sense of desperation,
racing against what is possible, racing against themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The soonest any team has won for the 100th time is Sept. 9,
accomplished by the 1961 Yankees and the 1906 Cubs, according to
the Elias Sports Bureau. The Yankees may reach that milestone by
the end of August, if only they keep pushing hard. They may win 120
games, if only they keep pushing.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Twins Monday night, the Yankees quickly scored the
requisite number of runs to win. Martinez singled home O'Neill in
the first inning; typically, the Yankees set Minnesota's Frank
Rodriguez on the defensive immediately, forcing him to throw 25
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez would throw 26 in the second inning, when the Yankees
effectively put the game out of reach, with some help from the
Twins. Chad Curtis and Scott Brosius each hit singles with one out,
and after a forceout, Jeter laced a single to left. One run scored,
and when Minnesota's Marty Cordova over-ran the ball in left, so
did another. Yankees 3, Twins 0.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius pounded a two-run homer in the fourth, his third home
run in three days and his 13th of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The only question was when or if the Twins would get a hit
against the Yankees. They did not get a hit in the ninth inning
against the Yankees May 16, Wells pitched his perfect game the next
day _ and Irabu had no-hit stuff Monday night, against one of the
league's most benign offenses.
</P>
<P>
   As he had in his previous start, Irabu had a fastball in the
mid-90s, the sort that hitters cannot catch up to, when thrown
above the waist. To complement this, Irabu's split-fingered
fastball dove and sunk and darted. Jorge Posada, the Yankees'
catcher, often blocked pitches in the dirt that the Twins had swung
over.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu hit Otis Nixon with his first pitch of the game, but
retired the next three batters, then all three Twins in the second.
Two outs into the third inning, Irabu walked Nixon and Matt Lawton,
but struck out Paul Molitor on three pitches to get out of the
scrape. Three innings, no hits.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth inning: Three batters, three outs. The streak of hitless
innings reached 14. But Cordova slapped a clean single through the
middle in the fifth inning, and many in the crowd stood and
clapped.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Mike Stanton relieved Irabu to open the eighth
inning, with the score 7-0. Stanton, who intermittently has had
control problems, walked two before giving up a three-run homer to
Lawton, breaking a streak of 371/3 innings of scoreless relief for
the Yanks.

THE PGA CHAMPIONSHIP LIES JUST BEYOND THE FOREST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (lb) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Ernie Els was asked Monday afternoon about
Sahalee Country Club, the site of this week's PGA Championship. Els
looked at the tall trees lining the fairways and surveyed the
picturesque setting about 22 miles northeast of downtown Seattle.
After two practice rounds, Els had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's brilliant,'' said Els, the two-time U.S. Open champion,
as he prepared for the year's final major. ``It's like playing in
Switzerland with these tall trees. This is not your normal venue.
The greens are beautiful, the layout flows from one hole to
another. I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Els' peers echoed his endorsement as the Pacific
Northwest looked forward to its first major since the 1946 PGA
Championship in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 150-man field had never seen Sahalee until this
week, making it important to learn as much about the course as
possible before play begins on Thursday. By Monday, most players
had arrived and had played at least nine practice holes, trying to
familiarize themselves with the nuances of the course.
</P>
<P>
   This much was obvious. It will be crucial to keep the ball in
the fairway and away from the towering trees _ some of them more
than 100 feet tall _ that line the fairways. Players who are
erratic off the tee may begin to feel claustrophobic as they stand
in the tee box, because the trees make the fairways look narrower
than they are.
</P>
<P>
   The early feeling among players was that Sahalee would be
demanding, but not as demanding as the Olympic Club in San
Francisco was for the U.S. Open in June, when Lee Janzen won with a
score of even par.
</P>
<P>
   Sahalee is a par-70, 6,906-yard course this week, and long
hitters might use their drivers only three or four times during a
round. Accuracy will be far more important than length. Two holes
that are normally par-5s have been shortened slightly and converted
to par-4s: No. 6 (480 yards) and No. 18 (475 yards). But while the
rough at Sahalee is higher than normal this week, there will be
birdie opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rough is bad, but not U.S. Open bad,'' Els said. ``They
don't need that kind of rough here, not with the trees they've got.
If you miss the fairway, you just have to hack it out anyway,
because there's not much of a chance to reach the green. The rough
is pretty tough around the greens, but overall, I don't think
anything could be as bad as Olympic.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the attention this week will focus on Mark O'Meara,
winner of the Masters and the British Open, who will try to become
the first man since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three majors in one
year. O'Meara, one of the game's better putters, is the type of
player who could find his groove on Sahalee's relatively flat
greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to putt well to win this week,'' Els said.
``That's why O'Meara has won two majors this year, because he has
putted so well.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara's success has made many of the game's top players
approach this week with a sense of urgency. Tiger Woods, the
world's No. 1-ranked player, is facing the prospect of not winning
a major this year, as are the other major champions of 1997: Els,
Justin Leonard and Davis Love III. Love is the defending PGA
champion, winning his first major at Winged Foot Golf Club in
Mamaroneck, N.Y., last year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The PGA Championship has enjoyed its share of memorable moments
this decade. Love's victory last year was poignant. A rainbow
appeared in the sky as he approached the 18th green, evoking
memories of his father, Davis Love Jr., a renowned teaching pro who
died in a plane crash in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   John Daly became a celebrity when he won the 1991 PGA
Championship, which he entered as a long-shot alternate and left as
a long-hitting champion with a cult following.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Couples, who grew up in Seattle, will be one of this year's
sentimental favorites, as he tries to win a major just a short
drive from where he was raised.
</P>
<P>
   But Sahalee, a course that has never held a major, is about to
be tested by the world's greatest players, and they all seemed
eager for the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my goals this year was to win a major, and I haven't
done it,'' Els said. ``I'm sure a lot of guys feel the same way.
We're all looking forward to this.''

3-YEAR-OLDS ARE TIGHTLY BUNCHED FOR TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four horses, one title.
</P>
<P>
   If he were to add the Travers to his victory on Sunday in the
Haskell, would Coronado's Quest lock up the 3-year-old
championship? Or would the Belmont Stakes plus a Travers add up to
year-end honors for the Haskell runner-up, Victory Gallop?
</P>
<P>
   Did last year's Horse of the Year, Favorite Trick, sneak back
into the picture with his dramatic victory Sunday in the Jim Dandy
at Saratoga? Or has two-thirds of a Triple Crown already equaled a
championship for the sidelined Real Quiet?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with Real Quiet out, it's sort of up to Victory Gallop
and Coronado's Quest not to give it up,'' said Shug McGaughey,
trainer of Coronado's Quest, who scored his fourth straight victory
and first Grade I victory in the Haskell at Monmouth Park. ``And I
think they'll probably have to figure it out on the race track. The
Breeders' Cup is our ultimate goal. The Travers is one big step.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Aug. 29 Travers at Saratoga is definitely step No. 2
for both Coronado's Quest and Victory Gallop, Favorite Trick is not
a serious candidate for the mile-and-a-quarter race, said his
trainer, Bill Mott.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mott, who was inducted into racing's Hall of Fame on
Monday at Saratoga, said he had his eye on the Breeders' Cup Mile
on the turf as a possible goal for Favorite Trick, whose victory in
the Jim Dandy, at a mile and an eighth, was his first beyond a
mile.
</P>
<P>
   But Mott did not rule the Travers out, and said he would take a
week or so before deciding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some thought,'' Mott said, adding, ``He
proved he was a champion last year.''
</P>
<P>
   If Favorite Trick is not entered in the Travers, and with Real
Quiet out for the year with a leg injury, Coronado's Quest and
Victory Gallop would be left to face Deputy Diamond, Raffis
Majesty, Archers Bay and possibly one or two others in the $750,000
race.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer Elliott Walden firmly believes that Victory Gallop,
who won the Rebel and the Arkansas Derby before finishing second to
Real Quiet in the first two legs of the Triple Crown, can win the
title and that the Travers will bear him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day will be to our advantage; Coronado's Quest was the
horse to beat in the Haskell, but I don't think that will be the
case in the Travers,'' said Walden, who admitted he took a chance
in running Victory Gallop in a nine-furlong race on a
speed-favoring track.
</P>
<P>
   McGaughey, who was also in Saratoga yesterday for the Hall of
Fame induction, conceded that Victory Gallop would no doubt relish
the mile and a quarter, but said he did not think the added
distance would disturb Coronado's Quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ultimate goal is the Breeders' Cup Classic, and I think
this was the first step,'' he said. ``We've got a ways to go,
though, and work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the Travers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tougher,'' McGaughey said of his once
fractious colt. ``Just getting him settled down, I knew he would
run a great race. We'll have to move forward off that race.''

CARTS HAVE TRADITION, PROFITS ON THEIR SIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JARRE FEES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Did the horse come before the cart?
</P>
<P>
   The Scots are credited with inventing golf in the 15th century,
and one can safely assume it was a game for noblemen _ peasants
generally lacked the time, equipment or permission to play a quick
nine holes.
</P>
<P>
   Noblemen owned horses (and servants, the first caddies no
doubt), and when has a nobleman walked when he could ride?
</P>
<P>
   Carts, one must then admit, are a golfing tradition, no matter
where one stands on the issue of Casey Martin. And they're not
going away. Golf courses earn too much money from their use.
</P>
<P>
   Their modern origins, however, are a bit mysterious. What's
known for sure is that carts first came off the assembly lines
following World War II, when Americans had more leisure time to
play golf and the economy boomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any real quantity, the mechanized cart has been around
since the 1950s,'' said Tom Marble, a manager with Club Car in
Corona, one of the two largest cart manufacturers in the nation.
``But long before they were mass produced, people were using
whatever they could to get around on the course. They used other
vehicles, and that eventually evolved into golf carts.''
</P>
<P>
   Although carts were mass-produced in Texas and other areas by
1958, Clint Airey, head pro at Westlake Village Golf Course, says
an early version of the cart was in use in the late '40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got out of high school in 1948, I was at Palos
Verdes,'' Airey said, ``and they were already being used. They were
crude, but they were here.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who suffers from a rare circulatory disorder, in
February successfully sued the PGA to be allowed to use a cart in
PGA tournaments. The PGA argued that walking is an integral part of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   But consider British ruler and Edinburgh native James I, who is
believed to have introduced golf to London in 1608.
</P>
<P>
   According to Encyclopedia Britannica, James I was a ``thin man
of average height who was constantly on horseback... and whose
English subjects derided his weak and spindly legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the picture of a rugged Scottish golfer. One has to
suspect James rode to each tee on horseback. Maybe the royal
caddies followed him with shovels.
</P>
<P>
   Sepulveda Golf Complex head pro Troy Rodvold said the dispute
over the use of carts is misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like walking makes everything that much harder,'' he
said. ``It's not like you're jogging. Most better players still
prefer to walk because they get into a good rhythm. But you get a
fair amount of exercise walking around at any job, unless you sit
and type all day. When they say using a cart is an advantage, it's
not really. It still comes down to how well you can hit the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Atlas, head pro at Woodley Lakes, said the cart is an
advantage to player and golf course alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are huge revenues for golf courses, especially private
courses, if they hold the cart concession. Municipal courses don't
usually profit as much,'' he said. ``And it helps speed up the
game, especially in this heat.''
</P>
<P>
   More players using carts means more players are able to play in
a day, which means more profits for golf courses even if they don't
own the cart concession.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers like Club Cart and EZ Go also reap their share of
profits from the cart boom, but getting an exact figure turned out
to be harder than digging up the history of golf itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well over 100,000 carts were manufactured and sold last
year,'' said Marble, who declined to give a specific figure for the
Ingersoll-Rand subsidiary. ``And believe me, that's a very
conservative estimate.''
</P>
<P>
   However obscure its history, however derided by professional
organizations, the future of the cart looks solid _ especially as
baby boomers retire and take up the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carts have been manufactured and sold for at least 40 years,''
Rodvold said. ``The PGA and USGA don't allow carts in competition,
but all the local courses do. It hasn't just improved the game for
golfers. It's also the revenues for the golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You figure $20 apiece for a couple of people to play 18 holes,
multiply that for each cart on each course nationwide. You can
figure out how good it is for the game.'' &UR;  &QL; 
Here are tips for those &QL; 
in need of driving lessons &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For those playing on hilly courses or who just like to ride,
here are the rules of cart etiquette:
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to keep up the pace of play, the driver drops a
player off at his ball, then goes to his own ball,'' said Woodley
Lakes head pro Larry Atlas. ``That's good etiquette. But sometimes
one player will sit and wait for the other, then they'll both go
across to the other ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large using a cart speeds up the game in the heat, in
the rain, even in the wind. The guys that drive in a bunker or too
close to the green _ those are the guys who don't belong on a golf
course anyway.''

BOEING LICENSE FOR SEA LAUNCH SUSPENDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. yesterday found itself trying to avoid the same
kind of political firestorm that recently engulfed U.S. satellite
maker Loral over the exchange of sensitive information with old
Cold War foes.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department suspended Boeing's export license for Sea
Launch, the first-ever project to launch commercial rockets from an
ocean platform, after the Seattle-based aerospace giant improperly
shared sensitive technical information with its Russian and
Ukrainian partners.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said the Justice Department is
reviewing the incident to determine if Boeing broke any U.S. laws.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sea Launch is all but dead in the water for now.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 Russian and Ukrainian engineers at the Sea Launch
homeport in Long Beach, Calif., who were preparing for the first
launch early in 1999, have returned home until the company gets its
license back. And the government won't say how long that will take.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Boeing nor the State Department would reveal exactly
what information was passed along to Russian and Ukrainian
engineers. Dick Dalton, a spokesman for Boeing in Washington, D.C.,
said the information in question was not classified, though he
would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Before the license suspension is lifted, Boeing must demonstrate
that it has adequate security safeguards in place to prevent a
recurrence of the lax procedures that got it into trouble, a State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people at Boeing are optimistic it will be a brief
suspension,'' a Congressional source said Monday. ``But because of
the Loral mess, it's not the best political environment for
something like this to come out now. The only worry Boeing has is
if politics comes into play. This is a hyper-sensitive issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The source said the conservative American Spectator magazine is
working on the story. If true, that could result in exactly the
kind of political repercussions that Boeing wants to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Boeing does not get caught up in the politics of this, it's
probably a non-event,'' said John Pike, director of space policy
for the Federation of American Scientists in Washington, D.C. ``If
it does, then it doesn't matter what they did. They are in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   A House select committee has been investigating U.S. satellite
technology exports to China by Loral. That incident, in which Loral
apparently helped the Chinese after one of their rockets exploded,
has received widespread attention and resulted in much negative
publicity for Loral.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee's mandate is narrow and it is unlikely to
examine the Boeing case, said George Behan, press secretary for
U.S. Rep. Norm Dicks, a Washington state Democrat and minority
leader on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean, however, that some other committee in
Congress won't investigate, Behan said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing briefed Dicks' office Friday about the matter in advance
of a Washington Post article Saturday that first disclosed the Sea
Launch license suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional source, who is familiar with what happened,
said a State Department representative was not present, as is
required under the export license agreement, when Boeing and its
partners discussed sensitive technical information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it was us (the United States) and not the Russians or
Ukrainians who benefited from the flow of information, but even so
it was a violation of the license,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts said the Boeing case does not appear to be
nearly as serious as that involving Loral.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese rocket technology is inferior to that of the United
States, and the concern in Congress is that any information
supplied by Loral could help China build more reliable nuclear
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Sea Launch, however, it is the Russians and
Ukrainians who are supplying the rocket, which is considered as
good if not better than rockets built by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is a partner in Sea Launch with the European shipbuilder
Kvaerner of Oslo, Norway; Russia's RSC-Energia in Moscow; and the
Ukrainian company Yuzhnoye/Yuzhmash.
</P>
<P>
   Energia is the company that launched the first Sputnik and
designed the Russian Mir space station. It also is building
hardware for the International Space Station, for which Boeing is
prime contractor. The Ukrainian company is best known for building
the former Soviet Union's most mighty intercontinental ballistic
missile, the SS-18, dubbed by the Pentagon as ``Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   Sea Launch will use a two-stage Zenit rocket built by the
Ukrainian company, with the third-stage built by Russia. As part of
its 40 percent stake in Sea Launch, Boeing's contribution includes
about $500 million and its expertise at integrating complex
engineering systems.
</P>
<P>
   The venture's first launch of a Hughes Space and Communications
satellite was originally scheduled for October, but was recently
postponed until early next year so Hughes could modify the
satellite. If the Sea Launch project remains shut down for any
length of time, that initial launch would be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Sea Launch has contracted to launch 13 Hughes Space and
Communications satellites. Sea Launch also has sold five launch
slots to Loral Space &AMP; Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department would not say how long it might be before
the project can resume.

YANKEES NOTEBOOK: DAVIS JOINING A CROWDED OUTFIELD; WAITING ON
NELSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chili Davis and Darryl Strawberry stood about 15 feet
apart in the Yankees' clubhouse Monday, each surrounded by
reporters, each answering questions about the other player. They
play the same position, and if Davis returns to the lineup next
week as expected, it's quite possible that only one will be able to
play at a time.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Yankees' version of a quarterback controversy:
Strawberry leads the Yankees with 21 home runs, while Davis has
none after missing all but two games this season with ankle
trouble, and yet Manager Joe Torre intends to play Davis regularly
when he first comes back.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry has been here all year and has become a working
symbol of the club's unselfishness, quietly accepting his part-time
role. Davis has been in Tampa, Fla., and has never worn pinstripes
on the Yankee Stadium playing field.
</P>
<P>
   But this is hardly Glenn Foley vs. Neil O'Donnell. Strawberry
and Davis are friends _ for most of this season, Strawberry has
worn a T-shirt given to him by Davis _ and both indicated they
would abide by whatever decisions Torre made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll be an obstruction,'' said Davis, who added
that he intended to speak to Torre when he was activated. ``You
don't want to interrupt some guys who are putting up some pretty
good numbers. I'll do whatever he sees as best.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry said: ``What I'm going to have on my mind is when Joe
puts me on the field, I'm going after it. It's a good problem to
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy for him, happy he's able to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is nearing the end of his 20-day minor-league
rehabilitation assignment. He began with Class A Tampa, before
moving up to Class AA Norwich, where he hit .243 with a homer and
five RBIs over 11 games. Davis took batting practice at Yankee
Stadium on Monday, and on Tuesday he will join Class AAA Columbus
for six days; unless he has a setback, the Yankees will activate
him next Monday in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees invested nearly $14 million in a three-year deal for
the 38-year-old Davis during the off season, and as Strawberry
joked over the weekend, their principal owner, George Steinbrenner,
will probably want to realize some dividend. If healthy and
productive, however, there is no question that Davis, who is coming
back from ankle surgery, will provide another element to the
offense, as a switch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Davis hit 30 home runs and drove in 90 runs for Kansas City last
season, and it appears Torre wants to play him enough to determine
whether he can regain his swing quickly enough to lend similar
support in the final month and the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis is strictly a designated hitter. Strawberry played
left field in spring training and at the season's outset, before
his weakened left knee relegated him to service as a designated
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Once Davis comes back, it figures that Torre will at least try
to play Strawberry in left field; on Monday, Torre said he had
clearance to play Strawberry on the artificial surface in Minnesota
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's limp, however, has worsened during the season, and
he may not be able to cover as much ground in the outfield as he
did in spring training. To incorporate both Strawberry and Davis in
the lineup, it may be that Torre will eventually use them as a
left-handed and right-handed platoon, with Tim Raines and Chad
Curtis sharing time in left.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting on Nelson
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have been extremely aggressive in making waiver
claims and preventing players on other teams from being traded. But
Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman is playing offense, as well
as defense, searching for another pitcher who could be used in the
postseason in the event Jeff Nelson does not return from back
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But Cashman said Monday that he did not think he would be able
to find a pitcher to his liking, because the good pitchers were
being claimed and therefore could not be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said the team's medical staff was confident that Nelson
would be back and ready to pitch around Sept. 1, giving the Yankees
about four weeks for the right-handed Nelson _ crucial to the
bullpen because of his ability to dominate right-handed batters _
to regain his command and for the Yankees to assess whether he is
healthy enough to be part of the postseason staff.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Holmes may also have a chance to return, but there are
those who believe Holmes' back trouble will prevent him from
pitching in the majors again this season.

MCGWIRE FEVER, LIKE THE BALL, GOES DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)  (ll) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The muscular giant with red hair, red goatee, red
baseball cap and red jersey flicked the 35-inch bat around like a
toothpick as he strode to the plate, causing the hundreds of fans
who were stationed in the left-field seats at Busch Stadium to
stand up and become imaginary outfielders. It was Mark McGwire time
in batting practice, which meant it was time for baseballs to
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Mets Manager Bobby Valentine had seen this powerful display
dozens of times, so he sat between the railings of the third-base
dugout with his back to the plate, actually looking at a bunch of
reporters instead of at McGwire. But Valentine did not need eyes to
know if McGwire had transformed another 75-mile-an-hour pitch into
a souvenir. The sounds told the story: lots of noise, lots of
souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark is the man,'' said Valentine, who never peeked over his
shoulder for a glimpse of McGwire, but did have a close-up view of
a deep fly ball that would have been a two-run homer off Al Leiter
in the first inning if it had not drifted foul by about 15 feet.
``I don't need to tell him anything.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is obviously the man here, where fans were lined up six
deep for tickets four hours before the first pitch of the
Mets-Cardinals game on Monday night and where the scramble for
seats in left field when the gates opened resembled a scene from
Pamplona. The fervor extends beyond the confines of Busch, where
McGwire's relaxing dinner for two sometimes becomes a meal with
three or four unwanted guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear, going out with him is like going out with Elvis,''
said Pat Kelly, one of McGwire's teammates and close friends.
``It's unbelievable. Everywhere he goes, people follow him. I feel
sorry for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine does not. The Mets' manager is amused by how McGwire
has become a little more ornery as his homer total has increased to
46 and the attention toward his chase of Roger Maris' 37-year-old
season record of 61 has intensified.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire would not speak with reporters from New York before
Monday night's game. When a reporter from St. Louis asked Valentine
how McGwire would handle the pressure if he were pursuing the most
illustrious record in baseball in New York, Valentine reminisced
about what Mickey Mantle told him on how Maris endured.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '61, the guy who was breaking the record was breaking Babe
Ruth's record,'' said Valentine, his voice rising as he mentioned
Ruth's name. ``He was competing against not Sammy Sosa, but Mickey
Mantle. Even though it's 1998 and we have more TV's and we have
more guys with pens, I think Roger Maris had as much, if not three
times more, scrutiny with everything he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said McGwire _ unlike Maris _ was the overwhelming
people's choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think they want McGwire to break it?'' Valentine said
with a smile that had already answered the question. ``I think most
people do. No one wants Sammy to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine thinks McGwire will topple Maris. Actually, he thinks
McGwire, Sosa and Ken Griffey Jr. will hit 62 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought in May that three would do it,'' Valentine said.
``I'll stick to three.''
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean Valentine wants to see McGwire rip even
one against the Mets in their three-game series. St. Louis manager
Tony La Russa groused Sunday about how the Cubs did not challenge
McGwire early in games, saying: ``I never have problems with it
late in the game. That's baseball. But the first five or six
innings? Never. It should be their best against your best.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, who does not exchange Christmas cards with La Russa
and who even tweaked the manager recently for batting the pitcher
eighth in the lineup, is unaware of rules on strategies for facing
the most productive power hitter in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethics?'' Valentine asked. ``First of all, I don't know if
it's important for him to break the record or not to break the
record as far as baseball is concerned. If it happens, I have
nothing to do with Mark McGwire. I don't deal with individual
players on my team. I deal with the team. And I don't deal with
individual players on their team. I deal with the team. It's us
against them. It's not a few of us against Mark or a few of them
against us. It's our team against their team, and we'll do whatever
we can to come out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant Valentine did not mind when Leiter walked McGwire
with the Mets leading, 2-1, with no one out and a runner on second
in the first inning. It probably irked La Russa, who watched the
Cubs walk his first baseman six times on Saturday and Sunday and
claimed it was ``stressing'' McGwire out. That will happen over and
over.
</P>
<P>
   As McGwire's pursuit continues, Valentine will watch from afar
and will be one person who still wonders what it all means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if the record holds, there will be just as much
excitement about it next year,'' Valentine speculated. ``Maybe that
will be better for baseball, I don't know. If he breaks it, I don't
know if that's good for the game.''

JUDGE HALTS CUNY'S PLANS TO CUT REMEDIAL CLASSES 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state judge on Monday ordered the City University
of New York to temporarily cease preparations to end remedial
classes at its senior colleges pending a trial on whether the
university violated the state's open meeting law.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ban on remedial classes is not set to take effect
until September 1999, the preliminary injunction issued on Monday
by Justice Elliott J. Wilk has immediate implications because CUNY
must begin to alert potential applicants to the new policy this
fall, and it has asked its colleges to submit implementation plans
by September.
</P>
<P>
   In his 20-page ruling, Wilk said he was granting a preliminary
injunction because the plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the
university had shown that CUNY's trustees had violated the state's
open meeting law. The trustees, who adopted the policy in a meeting
on May 26, ejected most of the public spectators at the meeting
rather than just those who were disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   Wilk also said in the ruling that he believed there was ``a
strong likelihood that the May 26, 1998, resolution will be
voided'' at trial.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY officials said Monday that they planned to appeal the
injunction. ``On the merits, I think the judge is absolutely
wrong,'' said Herman Badillo, vice chairman of CUNY's board of
trustees.
</P>
<P>
   If CUNY wins a stay of the injunction _ which government
agencies are usually granted _ an appeals court hearing to overturn
the injunction would probably be put off until at least October,
and a full trial until sometime later.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY officials said they believed a stay would allow them to
continue their preparations for carrying out their new policy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ruling cast some uncertainty on the longer-term
outlook for the policy, which says that any student who cannot pass
all three of CUNY's placement exams in reading, writing and
mathematics will not be allowed to register at CUNY's senior
colleges. Under the policy, students will be directed to community
colleges or to adult education courses.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of CUNY's entering freshmen at the four-year
colleges failed one or more of the placement tests last fall,
although some of them may have been able to pass the exams after
taking remedial courses during the summer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's office denounced Wilk's decision on
Monday, predicting that it would be reversed ``and will not stand
in the way of CUNY's efforts to raise standards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The opinion clearly is written by a judge who considers his
own personal political viewpoints to be more important than the
law,'' Anthony Coles, senior adviser to the mayor, said in a
statement. He said the remedial education vote ``has received more
public scrutiny than any CUNY vote in the last 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   CUNY has begun work on programs to expand remedial courses
during the summer and to give high school students better
preparation so they will be more likely to pass the placement
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Wilk said, however, that he was not persuaded that high school
and college administrators ``will be able to provide remedial
courses sufficient in quantity and quality to satisfy the need for
remediation formerly available at the senior colleges'' by
September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   When students and faculty members initiated the lawsuit three
years ago, they charged that CUNY repeatedly violated New York
state's open meeting law.
</P>
<P>
   Working with their lawyer, Ronald Minkoff, the plaintiffs
recently amended the complaint to include the May board meeting at
which the trustees adopted the remedial policy, which has been
widely attacked as too restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs said they hoped it would prevent the
implementation of the remedial policy, as well as force CUNY to
provide more room for the public at its meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board has been put on notice that it can't show contempt
for the public, and can't show contempt for the students,'' said
William Crain, a psychology professor at City College and one of
the plaintiffs.

METS BEAT CARDINALS, 4-2  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Inches. Fractions of inches, to be more precise.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Mets Manager Bobby Valentine estimated was the
margin by which Todd Hundley missed two home runs Sunday afternoon
in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   However little the margin, there was no doubt Hundley was
missing more often than not.
</P>
<P>
   During a three-game weekend series against the Colorado Rockies,
Hundley struck out in six consecutive at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into a three-game series with the Cardinals, Hundley had
struck out in seven of his last 10 plate appearances, eight of 11
after his first at-bat at Busch Stadium Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But when the St. Louis right-hander Matt Morris left a 1-0
fastball up in the third inning, there was no way Hundley was going
to miss again.
</P>
<P>
   He turned on the ball and hit it so hard that right fielder
Brian Jordan never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   The ball landed in the luxury suites in deep right field for a
two-run home run that helped power the Mets to a 4-2 victory over
the Cardinals.

   The home run, Hundley's first in the majors in nearly a year,
not only broke a 2-2 tie, but also lifted the Mets to their 15th
victory in their last 22 games.
</P>
<P>
   His last home run in the majors came Sept. 8, 1997, off the
Philadelphia right-hander Mike Grace.
</P>
<P>
   It mattered little that Hundley struck out again in his final
at-bat, and for the ninth time in his last 13 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley might be struggling at the plate, but with one at-bat,
he reminded everyone why a lineup with Hundley batting behind Mike
Piazza might be one of the most dangerous around.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two All-Stars drove in all the runs for the Mets
Monday night. Piazza knocked in two off Morris in first with a line
drive that found the gap in left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   But St. Louis came back to tie the score in the bottom of the
first on Ray Lankford's run-scoring double, Al Leiter's wild pitch,
and Jordan's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   With the score still tied, Piazza reached first in the third
inning on a two-out error by rookie shortstop Luis Ordaz, who let a
tough grounder play him.
</P>
<P>
   Up stepped Hundley, who was batting .197 when the day began.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley _ who had three hits at home last Thursday and two more
in Denver on Friday night _ said he was encouraged by his two
near-misses Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, it's frustrating,'' said the switch-hitting Hundley,
who struck out four times Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the production there. I feel good at the plate. It's
just getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   All that frustration was gone with one left-handed swing of the
bat.
</P>
<P>
   The blast made a winner out of Leiter (11-4), snapping a string
of three consecutive no-decisions for the veteran left-hander.
Leiter allowed four runs in each of his last three starts.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, after the two-run first, Leiter pitched six
scoreless innings to leave with the 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Leiter allowed four hits and two runs in seven innings,
walking two and striking out seven.
</P>
<P>
   He went to a full count each time he faced McGwire, walking the
St. Louis slugger in the first, before catching him looking in the
third (with a fastball, set up by a change up) and again in the
sixth (with a slider).
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who leads the majors with 46 home runs, came up once
more, with one out and a runner on first in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine called on the right-hander Turk Wendell to replace the
left-hander Dennis Cook.
</P>
<P>
   On a 2-2 count, McGwire took a big cut _ and struck out for the
third time.
</P>
<P>
   John Franco picked up his 24th save by pitching a scoreless
ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mets first baseman John Olerud, who went 0 for 3 with a walk on
Monday night, had his hitting streak stopped at 23 games, one short
of Hubie Brooks' team record.
