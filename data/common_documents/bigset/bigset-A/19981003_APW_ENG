	   STE-ANNE-DES-MONTS, Quebec (AP) _ One of Canadian Forces'
problem-plagued Labrador helicopters has crashed in Quebec's Gaspe
region, exploding on impact.
	   All six people on board were killed, said Lt. Steve Hebert of
Canadian Forces Base Greenwood in Nova Scotia.
	   The accident happened Friday afternoon in the town of Marsoui,
about 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of Quebec City.
	   The crash ignited a forest fire, which was extinguished by
firefighting aircraft.
	   The crew members were identified as pilots Capt. Peter Musselman
and Capt. Darrin Vandenbilche, flight engineers Master Cpl. David
Gaetz and Master Cpl. Glen Sinclair and search and rescue
technicians Sgt. Jean Roy and Master Cpl. Darrell Cronin. All were
stationed at Canadian Forces Base Greenwood, Nova Scotia.
	   The cause of the crash wasn't known.
	   The bright yellow Labradors, acquired in the 1960s for search
and rescue, use outdated technology and have a lengthy record of
engine and engine-system failures.
	   A 1992 crash of a Labrador near Bella Coola, British Columbia,
killed one of the crew members. An investigation blamed the crash
on a faulty engine design.
	   Another investigaton into a 1995 Labrador crash near
Margaretsville, Nova Scotia, found there had been 46 engine-related
safety incidents on the choppers since 1993.
	   Earlier this year, Ottawa announced that the fleet, reduced to
12 with the latest crash, would be replaced with 15 high-tech
Cormorant helicopters. The first replacement is expected in 2001.
	   The operations of the remaining Labradors will be restricted
until the cause of the Quebec crash is known, said Lieut. Jason
Proulx, a Greenwood spokesman.
	   ``We don't want to endanger the other crews needlessly.''

Military eases tensions in western New Guinea: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The commander of Indonesia's armed
forces has ordered a further scaling down of military operations in
western New Guinea, a news report said Saturday.
	   The Jakarta Post newspaper reported that Gen. Wiranto ended the
status of Irian Jaya, which covers western New Guinea, as a
military operations zone.
	   The move represents a further easing of tensions between the
military and Irianese seeking independence from Indonesia.
	   Two months ago, the military withdrew 300 combat troops from the
province, about 2,300 miles (3,700 kilometers) east of the capital,
Jakarta.
	   Earlier this week the military and the separatist Free Papua
Movement agreed on a cease-fire in the former Dutch colony.
	   Under the truce both sides have agreed to stop fighting so that
negotiations to set the stage for possible peace talks can start.
	   Irian Jaya was annexed by Indonesia in 1969 through a referendum
observed by the United Nations.
	   However, separatists maintain that the process of
self-determination was flawed and have stepped up protests against
Indonesian rule in recent months.
	   ``The military operation status has been revoked and our
activities will be shifted to safeguard vulnerable areas,'' the
paper quoted local military commander Maj. Gen. Amir Sembiring.
	   Indonesia's President B.J. Habibie, who took over power from
longtime autocratic President Suharto in May, has pledged for
political reform and respect for human rights.
	   Habibie has apologized for human rights abuses perpetrated by
the military under Suharto. Since Habibie took over, the military
has also scaled back its operations in other troubled territories,
such as the former Portuguese colony of East Timor.
	   Critics of the government, however, maintain that while some
combat troops have left East Timor, other troops have replaced
them.

Analysts: Asian markets will probably continue to slide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Markets across Asia will likely continue their
decline next week, pulled down by recession worries and a lack of
confidence that an effective global economic stimulus plan by G-7
nations will emerge.
	   ``With the exception of Thailand, which has already bottomed
out, markets across Asia will return to the lowest level they've
touched in the last couple of months,'' said Sebastian Chandra,
analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in Singapore.
	   A cut in lending rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve earlier this
week failed to boost world markets, which were increasingly spooked
by fears of global financial turmoil and economic recession.
	   On Friday, many Asian markets continued to drift lower as
cautious investors withdrew funds following a second day of heavy
selling on Wall Street.
	   Singapore's Straits Times Index fell 1.8 percent, while
benchmark indices in Manila and Taipei lost 2.6 and 4.0 percent
respectively. Stock markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai were closed
Friday for a Chinese national holiday.
	   Japan's benchmark Nikkei-225 Stock Average sank below 13,000
points for the first time since January 1986 before it reversed
course to close up 26.57 points, or 0.2 percent, at 13,223.69.
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average ended Friday
with a 2 percent rebound, halting a 476.31-point plummet over the
previous three sessions.
	   But even that gain couldn't offset the Dow's total loss of
244.08 points, or 3 percent, for the week.
	   President Bill Clinton warned Friday that half the world either
is in recession or experiencing very low economic growth and said
that the United States must help lead the world ``back away from
this financial precipice.''
	   But chances for an effective coordinated stimulus package for
Asia coming out of the Group of Seven nations meeting in Washington
this weekend are very small, according to Bernhard Eschweiler, head
of Asian research at J.P. Morgan in Singapore.
	   ``What you could get is some support for Latin American
countries, but given much reduced resources of the International
Monetary Fund, there will be no large surprises,'' Eschweiler said.
	   Asian analysts also said there seemed to be little faith that
Japan, troubled with its own faltering economy, can instill
regional confidence, even with its proposed assistance program for
the region.
	   During the G-7 meeting, Japan's Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
is expected to detail a dlrs 30 billion assistance plan to be
implemented over the next two years.
	   The money is aimed at encouraging Asian companies to restructure
debt, help banks write-off bad loans and alleviate the drain of
capital out of the region by spooked investors.
	   Others predict Asia's battered stock markets will continue to
take their lead from Wall Street.
	   ``If there are any signs of weakness in the U.S. economy, then
regional markets here are going to take another hit,'' said Yang Sy
Jian, chief economist at Kay Hian Research in Singapore.
	   Fresh evidence of a cooling of the U.S. economy emerged Friday
as the government reported a small rise in the unemployment rate
and a slowdown in the growth of new jobs.
	   ``Markets are being driven by fear,'' said Deutsche Morgan
Grenfell's Chandra. He said that for the next six months investors
are likely to hold onto their assets. ``But at one moment they
might want to cut their losses, and we will have some worse times
ahead,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian voters went to the polls
Saturday to choose between a conservative incumbent promising an
unpopular new tax and a Labor party that they had cast into the
political wilderness just 2 1/2 years earlier.
	   About 12 million registered voters began casting their ballots
at about 2230 GMT. Thousands of polling booths were set up in
public buildings in towns from the nation's desert Outback to its
tropical north and in its modern, bustling cities in the southeast.
	   Counting will begin about 0800 GMT, but the closeness of the
race means the final results may not be known for days.
	   Prime Minister John Howard has staked his government's fate on
what he calls ``economically radical'' tax reforms _ simplifying an
antiquated tax structure that has built up since the 1930s.
	   Whether Howard retains power rests on voters' willingness to
accept a 10 percent tax on all goods and services.
	   Howard's main opponent, Labor Party leader Kim Beazley, is
promising something far less painful: to create 500,000 new jobs.
And he has used a ``no tax'' promise to pull Labor close enough to
smell victory.
	   Labor was thrown out in a landslide victory for Howard in 1996,
and the historical odds are against Beazley.
	   Labor must hold all its current electorates and win 27 more to
seize a majority in the House of Representatives, the more powerful
chamber in Australia's bicameral Parliament.
	   If it succeeds, Labor will have achieved the largest comeback in
Australian election history, and Howard's will become the first
single-term government since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
	   Labor and the coalition have been in a dead heat for weeks,
according to the polls, indicating the most likely outcome may be
another Howard government but with a reduced majority.
	   But a Newspoll published Saturday in The Weekend Australian
shows a late surge by Labor large enough to restore it to power if
repeated at the ballot box. The telephone survey of 2,618 voters a
few days before the election put support for Labor at 44 percent
against the coalition's 40 percent.
	   Casting his vote in his west coast electorate, Beazley said he
found the latest poll difficult to believe and predicted there
would be a clear result by late Saturday night.
	   ``We've been there for over a century trying our very best to
represent the views of ordinary Australians. Sometimes we've
succeeded in winning their trust, sometimes we've not,'' Beazley
told reporters.
	   ``I'm just hopeful we have managed it again tonight.''
	   Voting in his Sydney electorate, Howard said he was nervous
about the outcome.
	   ``When you get to this stage you just wait and see what the
result is. I am hopeful but it will be tight. I think I confess to
a few first night nerves,'' Howard said.
	   Officials said voters were flocking to polling booths,
indicating electors were had made up their minds early and were
keen to get on with weekend activities. There is a holiday long
weekend in three states this weekend.
	   Currently, Howard's governing conservatives hold 91 seats, Labor
49 and independents eight.
	   Even if Howard retains control in the House of Representatives,
where government is formed, polls have indicated minor parties or
independents again will hold the balance of power in the upper
house, meaning the government may have to negotiate to get bills
passed.
	   Howard has tried to soften his tax plan by linking it to income
tax cuts worth Australian dollars 13 billion (U.S. dlrs 7.6
billion) a year and has promised to abolish a variety of other
wholesale taxes. But the income tax cuts are based on the uncertain
assumption that the Australian economy will continue to grow 3.5
percent a year to keep the federal budget in surplus.
	   Beazley, meanwhile, has promised to create a half-million jobs
in three years and has called for income tax cuts targeting
low-income earners. His proposed cuts would cost Australian dollars
3 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.8 billion), an amount he says would be
affordable even under the IMF's modest growth projections.

Authorities shut lines to people defying gas restrictions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREW TROUNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Authorities said Saturday they had
plugged or removed gas taps at more than 450 houses and businesses
in Victoria state to stop people cheating on restrictions imposed
after a refinery explosion.
	   More than 380 households and 68 businesses had kept their gas
supply on despite instructions not to from authorities backed by
the threat of Australian dollars 10,000 (U.S. dlrs 6,000) fines,
gas distribution company VENCorp. said.
	   The restrictions have been imposed so the small amount of gas
that is in the state's system is available to hospitals and
emergency services.
	   ``It is crucial that people don't use gas because supplies are
needed for emergency services,'' VENCorp. spokesman David
Guthrie-Jones said. He didn't say if anyone would be fined.
	   A fire at Esso's Longford gas refinery Sept. 25 killed two and
has left some 1.4 million households without gas in Australia's
second-most populous state.
	   An Esso spokesman said Saturday the company hoped the plant,
which supplies about 80 percent of state's gas, could start pumping
about half the normal supply by Monday.
	   Esso has so far been unable to determine the cause of the blaze
and explosions, which took two days to extinguish.
	   Hundreds of thousands of state residents are taking cold showers
and looking for electric griddles and frying pans to cook their
food. Many industries have had to suspend operations; funeral homes
have turned to bottled gas in order to keep crematoriums operating.
	   The state has opened sports stadiums and other public facilities
so people can shower there.
	   Some people have tried to prevent gas workers from cutting off
their service by chaining vicious dogs to their gas meters, but
they have been thwarted by being shut off from the street main
pipes.
	   On Friday, the eve of a close national election, Prime Minister
John Howard announced a 100 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs
58 million) relief fund for those worst hit by the gas shortage.
	   Victoria state is south of New South Wales, and Melbourne is
about 450 miles (720 km) southwest of Sydney.

	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ In a referendum on whether to make
citizenship easier for the country's enormous ethnic Russian
community, Latvians on Saturday chose between salving a sense of
injured pride and risking future injury.
	   The referendum, held in conjunction with voting for the
country's 100-seat Saeima parliament, asked voters if they want to
reject liberalizing citizenship law amendments that the parliament
passed in June.
	   The amendments were passed after a tense spring in which Russia
threatened trade sanctions against diminutive neighbor and rained a
hot barrage of denunciations, including Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov's
characterizing Latvia as committing genocide.
	   Meanwhile, the West was unhappy with Latvia, though its
statements were more measured. The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe urged changes and many officials predicted
that the European Union, which Latvia ardently wants to join, would
never let the country in unless it lowered the obstacles to
citizenship.
	   But after the amendments were passed, a referendum drive to
overturn them began, spearheaded by nationalist politicians who
claim Latvian national identity is imperiled.
	   Many Latvians resent Russians, seeing them not only as reminders
of Latvia's suffering during 50 years of Soviet rule, but as
diluting Latvia's sense of itself.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Russians poured into Latvia during the
Soviet years and today the country is little more than half ethnic
Latvian. While almost all Latvians speak passable Russian because
they learned it in Soviet-era schools, many Russians in the country
speak little or no Latvian.
	   Voting opened in clear, nippy weather _ the kind that usually
encourages low-motivation voters to cast their ballots. But how a
high turnout could effect the referendum was unclear; no opinion
polls on the referendum were conducted.
	   Despite the charged emotions behind the issue, observers say
there is little likelihood of violence whichever way the vote turns
out.
	   ``There are no armageddons here, just lost opportunities,'' said
a Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats in the Saeima
(pronounced SIGH-mah), the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party
of Prime Minister Guntars Krasts is the only major party
campaigning to turn down the changes.
	   On issues other than citizenship, like the need to seek EU and
NATO membership, there is wide agreement among the parties. There
is also broad support for the free-market reforms that have raised
Latvia up from the stagnant Soviet era.
	   Voter support for one party or another seems as much on the
personality of leaders as on specific issues.
	   The party that has been No. 1 in most pre-election polls with
around 20 percent support is the center-right Peoples Party, a new
party founded by wealthy businessman and a former prime minister,
Andris Skele.
	   Skele has said Latvia relies too much on transit trade to and
from Russia, and said policies should also focus on producing goods
in Latvia for export.
	   Other parties scoring around 15 percent in opinion surveys
include the rightist Fatherland and Freedom, the centrist Latvia's
Way and the opposition leftists, the Social Democrats.
	   The centrist News Party, led by flamboyant pop music composer
Raimonds Pauls, is also expected to score above the five percent
threshold required to win parliamentary seats.

high turnout could effect the referendum was unclear; no opinion
polls on the referendum were conducted.
	   Despite the charged emotions behind the issue, observers say
there is little likelihood of violence whichever way the vote turns
out.
	   Of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats in the Saeima
(pronounced SIGH-mah), the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party
of Prime Minister Guntars Krasts is the only major party
campaigning against the changes.
	   On issues other than citizenship, like the need to seek EU and
NATO membership, there is wide agreement among the parties. There
is also broad support for the free-market reforms that have raised
Latvia up from the stagnant Soviet era.
	   Voter support for one party or another seems as much on the
personality of leaders as on specific issues.
	   The party that has been No. 1 in most pre-election polls with
around 20 percent support is the center-right Peoples Party, a new
party founded by wealthy businessman and former prime minister,
Andris Skele.
	   Skele has said Latvia relies too much on transit trade to and
from Russia, and said policies should also focus on producing goods
in Latvia for export.
	   Other parties scoring around 15 percent in opinion surveys
include the rightist Fatherland and Freedom, the centrist Latvia's
Way and the opposition leftists, the Social Democrats.
	   The centrist News Party, led by flamboyant pop music composer
Raimonds Pauls, is also expected to score above the five percent
threshold required to win parliamentary seats.

 &UR; Mongolian democracy leader assassinated

<TEXT>
	   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) _ A prominent member of Mongolia's
democratic movement who was a potential candidate for prime
minister has been assassinated, the government announced late
Friday.
	   The prime minister's office said Sanjaasuregiin Zorig, minister
for infrastructure in the ruling Democratic Coalition, was axed and
stabbed to death at his home by two masked assailants at about
10:30 p.m. (1430 GMT) Friday.
	   The attackers escaped and remained at large as of Saturday
afternoon.
	   The killing, believed to be politically motivated, could further
complicate efforts to break a deadlock in Mongolian politics that
has persisted since Prime Minister Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj resigned
with his entire cabinet on July 24.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second quake in northwestern China

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two moderately strong earthquakes have struck
remote regions in southwestern and northwestern China, but there
were no immediate reports of casualties, local officials said
Saturday.
	   A magnitude 5.2 earthquake struck Jiashi county, in northwestern
Xinjiang province, at 1:01 a.m. Saturday (1701 GMT Friday), jolting
residents from their sleep but causing little damage, said an
official with the Xinjiang Seismology Bureau who gave only her
surname, Liu.
	   She said the earthquake, which was not followed by aftershocks,
was ``not serious.''
	   That came after a magnitude 5.3 earthquake jostled Ninglang Yi
Autonomous County, a region of rugged terrain along Yunnan
province's border with Sichuan province, on Friday evening, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   About 10 percent of the houses in the area were severely
damaged, but information on casualties was still being sought, said
an official at the provincial Seismology Bureau who also gave only
his surname, Li.
	   He said the area had been rattled by eight aftershocks since the
main tremor.
	   Xinhua said the bureau had sent teams to the affected area to
investigate and monitor any further quakes.
	   Ninglang is an area predominantly inhabited by the Yi, one of
China's many ethnic minorities. The area is one of China's most
seismically active regions. A magnitude 7 earthquake on Feb. 3,
1996, in neighboring Lijiang killed 255 people and injured 14,000.
	   Jiashi, about 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) west of Beijing, is
likewise an active earthquake zone. It has suffered three strong
quakes in the past two years that have killed 36 people. Nine
earthquakes stronger than magnitude 6 have hit the area since Jan.

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Right-wing populist leader Pauline
Hanson on Saturday conceded she is fighting for her political life
in a tight race for her parliamentary seat but predicted victory
for herself and her One Nation party.
	   She forecast One Nation would capture up to six Senate seats and
between 12 and 15 in the lower house.
	   She also forecast a narrow victory to Prime Minister John
Howard's conservative the coalition with a vastly reduced majority,
and possibly relying on smaller parties in the lower house.
	   Casting her vote at the North Ipswich state school, she said,
``I'm back,'' and said re-entering Parliament would be the greatest
day of her life.
	   ``I look forward to being surrounded by One Nation colleagues
who can help me change and improve what the federal government has
been doing,'' she said.
	   Asked if she was feeling nervous, she agreed she was because her
own parliamentary career was more directly on the line.
	   ``This is me. This is my seat. So I am personally applying for
my seat today. I am reapplying for my job.''
	   Was she fighting for survival?
	   ``Yes, of course I am, and if you don't think it is fighting for
survival, then you've lost,'' she said.
	   Hanson, who won the seat of Oxley as an independent in 1996,
faces competition from six other candidates in Blair.
	   Her major rivals are the Liberal candidate Cameron Thompson and
Labor's Virginia Clarke.

Serbs move to evade NATO intervention

Annan report in graf 9 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Anxious to avoid NATO airstrikes,
Serb authorities are scrambling to show they are making progress
toward ending the conflict in Kosovo by complying with U.N. orders
to withdraw their troops from the troubled province.
	   But ethnic Albanian political leaders have rebuffed their offer
to hold talks, saying they won't sit down with the Serbs until NATO
intervenes.
	   ``The bombing of Serb forces and positions is a necessary step
to create conditions for truthful negotiations,'' said the
Democratic League for Kosovo, the leading ethnic Albanian political
party, on Friday. ``Experience from Bosnia shows Serbia accepts
dialogue only when forced to.''
	   Low-grade talks between the two sides, which the Serbs say could
lead to restoring some of the autonomy they took away from Kosovo
in 1989, broke off last May.
	   Despite the Serbs' claims that forces have been withdrawn and
fighting is over, there are reports of continuing clashes in the
separatist province of southern Serbia.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, said Serb forces attacked two villages Friday
near Malisevo in southwestern Kosovo, then sent in reinforcements
when Kosovo Liberation Army rebels fought back.
	   For its part, the pro-Serb Media Center said Yugoslav army
border guards came under grenade-launcher fire from inside
Albania's territory near the Pogaj border outpost opposite Prizren,
Kosovo.
	   Besides asking the ethnic Albanian negotiating team to resume a
political dialogue, the Serbs invited U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to visit Kosovo, removed a key police roadblock and showed
reporters heavy equipment they said has been withdrawn.
	   But Annan, who is to deliver a report Monday on whether
Milosevic has complied, turned down the offer. And the United
States warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that NATO will
strike Serb forces within two weeks unless he meets all U.N.
demands in halting his assault on ethnic Albanians.
	   ``We cannot allow this conflict to spread again and risk what we
stopped in Bosnia starting over again in Kosovo,'' U.S. President
Bill Clinton said.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, however, argued the
problems in Kosovo cannot be solved by the use of outside force.
And Russia's parliament declared that any action taken without U.N.
approval would be considered an ``illegal act of aggression.''
	   The international furor over the Serbs' eight-month war in
Kosovo has intensified this week, pushing the United States and
other countries to the verge of long-threatened airstrikes.
	   The Serbs' efforts to crush separatist resistance in the
province, which is populated largely by ethnic Albanians, has
killed hundreds of people and driven an estimated 275,000 from
their homes.
	   Even as the Serbs said this week that they were halting their
action against Kosovo ``terrorists,'' evidence surfaced of at least
two massacres of civilians in the Drenica region within recent
days.
	   After a session of the Yugoslav government in Belgrade on
Friday, officials issued a statement saying the fighting had ended
and blaming continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels.

Doohan takes pole for Australian Grand Prix
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHILLIP ISLAND, Australia (AP) _ World champion 500-c.c.
motorcycle champion Mick Doohan has secured pole position for
Sunday's Australian Grand Prix race ahead of major rival Max Biaggi
of Italy.
	   Neither Doohan, who is going after his fifth consecutive world
title, nor the other contenders could improve Saturday on Friday's
opening qualifying session which saw the Australian take
provisional pole.
	   Doohan's time of 1 minute, 33.16 seconds gave him top spot, half
a second ahead of Biaggi.
	   It was fractionally slower than Doohan's pole-setting time last
year, when he fell while leading the race, but almost a full second
under his own lap record for the track.
	   American John Kocinski will start from third place on the grid
with New Zealander Simon Crafar fourth.
	   Biaggi suffered a setback Saturday while trying to better
Friday's time when he slid off on turn nine, following the tumbling
Honda into a tire barrier.
	   The Italian was unhurt in the fall and maintained his front row
position based on Friday's quick time which he managed in the final
lap of the session.
	   Defending Australian champion Alex Criville of Spain will start
from the second row of the grid in seventh spot. (djp)

<TEXT>
	   BATHURST, Australia (AP) _ Swedish driver Rickard Rydell broke
the two-liter race lap record by almost two seconds Saturday to
provide Volvo with its first pole position in the 36-year history
of the Bathurst 1,000 endurance event.
	   Rydell, who clinched this year's British Touring Car
Championship title for the Swedish manufacturer two weeks ago, won
pole position for Sunday's race when he recorded the fastest time
in the traditional one-lap dash between the top 10 qualifiers at
Mt. Panorama.
	   The 31-year-old florist from Stockholm clocked 2 minutes, 14.92
seconds around the 6.2-kilometer (3.8-mile) circuit in the Works
Volvo S40 he is driving with five-time Bathurst champion Jim
Richards of Australia.
	   Rydell's time was 1.48 seconds quicker than his closest rival,
Australia's Steven Richards driving a Nissan Primera, and 1.87
seconds inside the race lap record set 12 months ago by England's
Jason Plato in a Williams-Renault.
	   A total of 43 cars will start the 161-lap race. (djp)

Mongolian democracy leader assassinated
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS grafs 7-9 to clarify
 &UR; By MICHAEL KOHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) _ A prominent member of Mongolia's
democratic movement who was a potential candidate for prime
minister has been assassinated.
	   The prime minister's office said late Friday that Sanjaasuregiin
Zorig, minister for infrastructure in the ruling Democratic
Coalition, was axed and stabbed to death at his home by two masked
assailants at about 10:30 p.m. (1430 GMT) Friday.
	   The attackers escaped and remained at large as of Saturday
afternoon.
	   The killing, believed to be politically motivated, could further
complicate efforts to break a deadlock in Mongolian politics that
has persisted since Prime Minister Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj resigned
with his entire cabinet on July 24.
	   A 36-year-old Moscow-educated former social sciences professor
and a member of parliament since 1990, Zorig had remained as acting
minister along with other cabinet members pending the formation of
a new government.
	   A popular figure who played a leading role in the 1990
democratic revolution that ended seven decades of Stalinist rule,
he was widely expected to be named next week as a possible
successor to Elbegdorj.
	   The coalition has considered and failed to agree on four earlier
candidates for the job. Zorig would have become the fifth nominee
to be proposed.
	   The crisis was precipitated when the three-month-old coalition
government lost a vote of no confidence following a feud over
whether to merge a state bank with a private bank.
	   The opposition Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the
former communists, accused the government of organizing the merger
in a way that financially benefited its members and protested by
boycotting the Great Hural, Mongolia's parliament, throwing
proceedings into turmoil for almost two months.
	   The political impasse has prevented work on crucial economic
legislation.
	   Mongolia, once dependent on subsidies from Moscow, has seen its
economy weaken precipitously since the breakup of the Soviet Union.
According to World Bank estimates, 36 percent of its 2 million
people live in poverty. Inflation topped 30 percent last year and
unemployment is high in what is still a largely pastoral economy.
	   In 1990, peaceful protests forced the pro-Soviet People's
Revolutionary Party to drop communism and allow free and fair
multiparty elections. Its 75-year rule ended with a 1996
parliamentary election that swept the reformist Democratic Union
into office and won accolades for the nation's progress toward
democracy.

Long and thirsty mission in beery bars reaches conclusion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Doug Montgomery has finally
quenched his thirst. Eleven years and 1,130 bars after he set out
on the ultimate pub crawl, the local accountant ended his mission
this month.
	   Patrons of the Leithfield Hotel north of Christchurch witnessed
the historic event with little fanfare, as Montgomery raised a
glass to his lips -- having ordered a beer in every bar in New
Zealand.
	   It was a quest that took the 62-year-old from Northland's
Houhora Tavern to the South Seas Hotel on Stewart Island; from
Waiapu Hotel at Tikitiki on the East Coast, to Manapouri's Lake
View Motor Lodge in the west.
	   And all the upscale city haunts and backblock booze barns in
between.
	   The late Tony Palmer, manager of New Zealand's gold medal hockey
team in 1976, gave Montgomery the inspiration.
	   ``He said he was going to have a drink at every pub in the
country. He started a list but he did not get that far with it,''
Montgomery said Saturday.
	   After Montgomery got into the bar trade, he began to take the
mission more seriously. He worked out from specific events and
diary notes that he had already been to 248 pubs, starting with the
Kamo Hotel in 1953.
	   From 1987 on, his vacations, accountancy and chartered-club work
and sporting trips were interspersed, or even planned around pubs
he had yet to visit on a master list compiled from the Yellow Pages
and hotel industry sources.
	   Often he would simply dash in have a glass of beer to prove he
had drunk there and dash out again to his waiting wife or taxi
driver. His one-day record is 27 beers in Wellington, and although
he admits he was down to smaller glasses by the end, he still
managed to take his wife Jan to dinner that night.
	   Montgomery acknowledges that a pub -- which he defines as a
venue with a bar as its main focus -- could have sprung up without
his knowing. But he doubts it.
	   And for a chaser?
	   ``Well, I have been to a few in Australia.''

	   BEIJING (AP) _ An elementary school teacher in southwestern
Sichuan province has been executed for raping at least 12 female
students, aged seven to 12, according to a report seen Saturday in
Beijing.
	   Tang Jin was executed Thursday by order of the Sichuan High
Court following his conviction for a month earlier for raping the
girls between 1995 and May of this year, the Yangcheng Evening News
reported Friday.
	   The report said Tang, a substitute teacher at a school in Tiehu
village, had openly committed the crimes against the students while
in the classroom. The report did not provide further details.

Scientists to take submarine to study underwater volcanoes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Scientists from a joint German-New
Zealand project leave Auckland on Sunday with a small submarine to
resume a study of underwater volcanoes.
	   Expedition members on the German research vessel Sonne will
conduct manned dives with the submersible Jago, which has a diving
capacity of 1,300 feet (400 meters).
	   The dive sites will include the underwater Rumble 3 volcano, 125
miles (200 km) due north of East Cape, and a series of hydrothermal
vent locations near White Island, off the Bay of Plenty coast.
	   The dives are part of the project's second stage, which ends in
Wellington on Oct. 15.
	   The project involves five German universities and three New
Zealand groups -- the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric
Research (NIWA), the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences,
and Auckland University.
	   NIWA scientist Ian Wright said new and exciting discoveries were
made during the project's first leg, which comprised a journey from
Suva, Fiji, through the Kermadec Islands to Auckland to map the sea
floor.
	   He said the results had significantly increased understanding of
active volcanic systems associated with the ``ring of fire''
between Tonga and New Zealand.
	   One of the most exciting finds was the discovery of active,
high-temperature hydrothermal vent fields within the Brothers
volcano, 185 miles (300 km) north of New Zealand. The volcano was
discovered only in 1994.
	   Photographs and temperature measurements produced evidence of
active black smoker chimneys within the caldera, or cauldron-like
cavity on the summit, in water depths of up to a mile (1,600
meters).
	   ``These sites are the first active black smokers discovered in
New Zealand waters and represent a very rare number worldwide in
this type of volcanic setting,'' Wright said.
	   He said video footage and photos indicated that unique species
are associated with the vent sites.
	   Kiel University professor Peter Stoffler said what surprised him
was the amount and variety of marine life in the area.
	   ``I've never seen so much in my life,'' he said.
	   ``We didn't have a biologist on board, so we were always saying,
`What's that?' There was a tremendous amount of fish there.''

Private hospital in Singapore opens luxury suite fit for royalty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A private hospital in Singapore has opened its
luxurious royal suite _ previously used exclusively by the Sultan
of Brunei's family _ to the general public. But expect to pay a
king's ransom.
	   Mount Elizabeth Hospital's Brunei Royal Suite is adorned with
the finer touches: a gold-plated cord to summon nurses, elephant
tusks on mahogany doors, French crystal glasses, a butler serving
catered food on fine-boned china, and the obligatory karaoke set.
	   The suite was opened for public use at 6,000 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 3,550) a day after the Sultan decided in July not to renew a
contract reserving the posh rooms, The Straits Times reported on
Saturday.
	   Equipped with state-of-the-art hospital technology, the suite
includes a private nurse catering to your every need 24 hours a day
and a full-time security guard, according to the report.
	   Looking more like a five-star hotel suite, most of the trimmings
are gilded with solid gold.
	   Since its construction five years ago, the Sultan never received
treatment in the luxurious suite, though he visited sisters cared
for in the royal ward, the report said.
	   No figures were given for the number of patients who have used
the royal ward since it was made available to the public, and
hospital officials were unavailable for comment.

Embattled author seeks international support for her safety
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Author Taslima Nasrin, who faces death
threats from religious extremists and a warrant for her arrest,
sought international intervention Saturday for her safety in
Bangladesh.
	   ``I need protection for my life. The international community
should come forward to ensure my safety,'' Nasrin, 36, told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview from her hide-out.
	   She said she appealed to the British chapter of International
PEN, a writers' group, to contact the Bangladesh government and
protect her from Islamic extremists who have offered a reward of
200,000 takas (dlrs 5,000) to anyone who kills her.
	   After a four-year self-imposed exile, Nasrin returned home from
New York in September and said she wanted to nurse her 60-year-old
mother, who has colon cancer.
	   ``I want my freedom back,'' Nasrin said. ``This is my country
and I've every right to freely live here.''
	   After the state filed charges against her in 1994 for
blaspheming Islam, Nasrin went into hiding for two months to avoid
death threats until a court granted her bail and allowed her to
leave the country. Since then, she has lived in Europe and America,
supported by PEN.
	   Ten days after her homecoming, a Dhaka magistrate revived
another 1994 arrest warrant issued in a civil suit, filed in
addition to the state-sponsored criminal case.
	   Her return also prompted renewed street protests by Islamic
conservatives who call for her death by public hanging, even though
the offense carries a maximum punishment of two years in jail.
	   An alliance of several Islamic groups has planned a bigger
protest in Bangladeshi capital Sunday.

Malaysian minister's plea: Taxi drivers should not talk politics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The word is out: Malaysia's taxi
drivers are not to talk to foreigners about the one thing they
discuss most these days _ the country's political turmoil.
	   Reminding airport taxi drivers they are Malaysia's ``diplomats
to tourists,'' Deputy Transport Minister Mohamad Ali Rustam told
them not to discuss the firing, jailing and apparent beating of
former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar Sept. 2, and he was
arrested Sept. 20 after holding nationwide rallies calling for
reform and Mahathir's resignation. When Anwar appeared in court
Tuesday and Wednesday, he had a black eye and bruises.
	   The case has received international news coverage that the
Tourism Board blamed Friday for a drastic drop in visitors at a
time when Malaysia needs foreign currency.
	   Mohamed Ali suggested a canned response for the taxi drivers,
reminding them that they could lose income if foreigners view
Malaysia as an unstable place to visit.
	   ``If they are asked by passengers about the Anwar issue, they
should say the matter should be resolved by the court as it is a
personal matter,'' Mohamed Ali said in remarks quoted Saturday by
The Star, a pro-government newspaper.
	   He also said that the drivers he met with had promised not to
play Anwar's speeches on their cassette players as they drive
tourists to the sites. He said he would be meeting with other taxi
associations to pass on the message.
	   It's no wonder the government wants to muzzle the drivers _
Anwar is a favorite topic in the nation's taxis.
	   An airport limousine driver on the island of Borneo, for
example, spent almost an hour discussing the case with a group of
American and Canadian tourists as he drove them to their resort
hotel near Kuching last weekend.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian voters chose Saturday
between a conservative incumbent prime minister promising an
unpopular new tax and a Labor party that they had cast into the
political wilderness just 2 1/2 years earlier.
	   About 12 million registered voters casting their ballots at
thousands of polling booths in public buildings in towns from the
nation's desert Outback to its tropical north and in its modern,
bustling cities in the southeast.
	   Counting will begin about 0800 GMT, but the closeness of the
race means the final results may not be known for days.
	   Prime Minister John Howard has staked his government's fate on
what he calls ``economically radical'' tax reforms _ simplifying an
antiquated tax structure that has built up since the 1930s.
	   Whether Howard retains power rests on voters' willingness to
accept a 10 percent tax on all goods and services.
	   Howard's main opponent, Labor Party leader Kim Beazley, is
promising something far less painful: to create 500,000 new jobs.
And he has used a ``no tax'' promise to pull Labor close enough to
smell victory.
	   Labor was thrown out in a landslide victory for Howard in 1996,
and the historical odds are against Beazley.
	   Labor must hold all its current electorates and win 27 more to
seize a majority in the House of Representatives, the more powerful
chamber in Australia's bicameral Parliament.
	   If it succeeds, Labor will have achieved the largest comeback in
Australian election history, and Howard's will become the first
single-term government since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
	   Labor and the coalition have been in a dead heat for weeks,
according to the polls, indicating the most likely outcome may be
another Howard government but with a reduced majority.
	   But a Newspoll published Saturday in The Weekend Australian
shows a late surge by Labor large enough to restore it to power if
repeated at the ballot box. The telephone survey of 2,618 voters a
few days before the election put support for Labor at 44 percent
against the coalition's 40 percent. The margin of error was about 2
percent.
	   Casting his vote in his west coast electorate, Beazley said he
found the latest poll difficult to believe and predicted there
would be a clear result by late Saturday night.
	   ``We've been there for over a century trying our very best to
represent the views of ordinary Australians. Sometimes we've
succeeded in winning their trust, sometimes we've not,'' Beazley
told reporters.
	   ``I'm just hopeful we have managed it again tonight.''
	   Voting in his Sydney electorate, Howard said he was nervous
about the outcome.
	   ``When you get to this stage you just wait and see what the
result is. I am hopeful but it will be tight. I think I confess to
a few first night nerves,'' Howard said.
	   Officials said voters were flocking to polling booths,
indicating electors were had made up their minds early and were
keen to get on with weekend activities. There is a holiday long
weekend in three states this weekend.
	   Currently, Howard's governing conservatives hold 90 seats, Labor
49 and independents eight.
	   Even if Howard retains control in the House of Representatives,
where government is formed, polls have indicated minor parties or
independents again will hold the balance of power in the upper
house, meaning the government may have to negotiate to get bills
passed.
	   Howard has tried to soften his tax plan by linking it to income
tax cuts worth Australian dollars 13 billion (U.S. dlrs 7.6
billion) a year and has promised to abolish a variety of other
wholesale taxes. But the income tax cuts are based on the uncertain
assumption that the Australian economy will continue to grow 3.5
percent a year to keep the federal budget in surplus.
	   Beazley, meanwhile, has promised to create a half-million jobs
in three years and has called for income tax cuts targeting
low-income earners. His proposed cuts would cost Australian dollars
3 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.8 billion), an amount he says would be
affordable even under the IMF's modest growth projections.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ If Bosnia does not take the
necessary measures to update its computer systems, all might crash
on Jan. 1, 2000, jeopardizing some of the U.S. dlrs 500 million
invested in the country, according to the World Bank.
	   The ``millennium bug'' could also create severe disruptions in
key sectors such as power, telecommunications, health, social
welfare, wage and pension payments, the financial organization said
in a statement Friday.
	   The statement followed a recent visit to Sarajevo by Prabhat

Central Asia region.
	   The Bosnian Council of Ministers said it plans to establish a

deal with the problem.

Pope John Paul II in Croatia to beatify WW II cardinal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with pope's arrival. No pick up &QL; 
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Pope John Paul II was greeted by a crowd
of nearly a half-million people on Saturday as he arrived at a
shrine outside Zagreb to beatify Croatia's controversial World War
II Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac.
	   It is John Paul's second visit to the country, considered by the
Vatican a Catholic bastion in the Balkans.
	   The pilgrims greeted the pope joyfully as he rode in his
popemobile to the Marian shrine in Marija Bistrica. Croatia's
leading shrine to Mary, the mother of Jesus, is located 25
kilometers (16 miles) northeast of the capital.
	   More than 400,000 people were at the open-air site. Many more
were expected to watch live TV coverage of the event, considered
one of the biggest in the recent history of the country where about
80 percent of its 4.7 million people are Roman Catholics.
	   Stepinac was hailed as a hero by Catholics for his resistance to
communism and refusal to separate the Croatian church from the
Vatican. But his beatification, the last step before possible
sainthood, is controversial because many Serbs and Jews accuse him
of sympathizing with the Nazis.
	   On Friday, the pontiff knelt and prayed for two minutes before
the glass tomb of Stepinac, embalmed in red and gold vestments and
a gold miter, in Zagreb's cathedral.
	   While serving as Zagreb's archbishop in 1941, Stepinac supported
Croatia's German-backed fascist puppet government led by dictator
Ante Pavelic.
	   By 1942, however, Stepinac denounced the regime's genocidal
policies, which led to the extermination of thousands of Serbs,
Jews, Gypsies and Croat opponents. Stepinac's own notes and recent
studies say he spoke out against the atrocities, and worked to save
lives, but many Serbs still consider him a war criminal.
	   After the war, the cardinal was tried by Yugoslavia's communist
government and sentenced to prison for collaborating with the
Nazis. He died while under house arrest, the basis of the Vatican's
finding that he died for his faith.
	   On Friday, the pope spoke of ``the terrible period of Communist
repression.''
	   Croatia was a part of communist-run Yugoslavia until 1991, when
it proclaimed independence. The Vatican was one of the first
countries to recognize the young state.
	   The secession of Croatia, and later of neighboring Bosnia, led
to bloody wars in which tens of thousands of people were killed.
	   When the pontiff came here for the first time in 1994, one third
of the country was still in rebel Serbs hands, while the war in
Bosnia was still raging.
	   ``Now, happily, the war is no more,'' the pope told a crowd in
the cathedral square. ``My hope is that there will never again be
war in this noble country,'' he said to sustained applause.
	   ``The obstacles created by the consequences of war and the
mentality shaped by the Communist regime are many,'' the pope said.
``I hope most fervently that in this part of Europe there will
never again be a repetition of the inhuman situations which we have
repeatedly seen in this century.''
	   The pontiff also called on Croats to spur reconciliation among
the nation's ethnic, religious and political groups. In a gentle
jab at the government, he urged ``an ever greater democratization
of society.''
	   The 78-year-old pope, slowed by a series of ailments in recent
years, appeared in good form and delighted by the warm welcome.

	   But the income tax cuts are based on the uncertain assumption
that the Australian economy will continue to grow 3.5 percent a
year to keep the federal budget in surplus.
	   Beazley, meanwhile, has promised to create a half-million jobs
in three years and has called for income tax cuts targeting
low-income earners. His proposed cuts would cost Australian dollars
3 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.8 billion), an amount he says would be
affordable even under the International Monetary Fund's modest
growth projections.

	   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) _ With his New York Yankees teammates
celebrating all around him, Tim Raines climbed atop a picnic table
and made a special toast to the one guy missing the party.
	   ``Straw really wanted this and this one's for him,'' Raines
said, dedicating to Darryl Strawberry the Yankees' 4-0 victory over
the Texas Rangers early today that completed a sweep of their AL
division series.
	   Raines' words were met with cheers, a big swig and the spraying
of champagne. And why not? After the 36 hours the Yankees had been
through, they deserved it.
	   Players learned just before batting practice Thursday that the
36-year-old slugger has colon cancer. On Friday, their mood
lightened when Strawberry sent them a videotaped pep talk urging
them to ``go get 'em,'' but then they had to wait out a three-hour,
16-minute rain delay before finishing their mission.
	   ``I don't think anyone knew how to react,'' winning pitcher
David Cone said of the celebration. ``It was nice to see the guys
let go a little bit _ not too much, but just right.''
	   Strawberry watched the game from his New York hospital room.
He's scheduled to undergo surgery this afternoon. The Yankees were
flying back around the same time.
	   New York plays the winner of the Boston-Cleveland series in the
AL championship series, starting Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium.
The Indians beat the Red Sox 4-3 Friday to take a 2-1 lead, and
Game 4 is today.
	   The Yankees' 3-0 start to the postseason enhances their claim to
being one of baseball's greatest teams ever. They won an AL-record
114 games in the regular season and are eight victories from a
second World Series championship in three years.
	   Shane Spencer has emerged as the latest secret to New York's
success. After blowing onto the scene with three grand slams in the
last few weeks of the season, he hit two in this series, including
a three-run shot Friday, prompting Torre to refer to Spencer as
``Roy Hobbs.''
	   ``If I'm dreaming, I don't want to wake up,'' Torre said.

U.S. dollar will not be banned says Primakov
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN IAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday
there were no plans to ban the circulation of dollars in Russia,
but the government would take steps to curb the outflow of the U.S.
currency.
	   Meeting with Western businessmen, Primakov also said that the
privatization of Russian enterprises would continue.
	   Responding to media reports of a government economic plan that
would prohibit Russians from buying U.S. dollars and other foreign
currency, Primakov said the reports ``absolutely do not correspond
to reality,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted him as saying.
	   He said there was no need to regulate the influx of dollars into
Russia, but the government should take steps to prevent what he
called ``the dollar drain.''
	   Russian companies stashed about dlrs 2.5 billion outside the
country in September alone, the Interfax news agency reported
Friday, quoting central bank figures.
	   Primakov told the businessmen that Russia would continue its
privatization program, ``within limits,'' Interfax reported. ``We
will implement privatization so that it serves the interests of all
the country,'' he said.
	   Primakov said foreign investors are ``the force'' that will help
Russia to minimize its losses from the current economic crisis.
	   ``We are very much interested in foreign investments, especially
in ones that go into the real production sector,'' Primakov said,
according to Interfax. ``We need a continuous dialogue with foreign
investors, without whom it will be difficult for us to overcome the
current difficulties.''
	   He said Russia wanted long-term investments. ``Foreign capital
has been coming to the country via short-term operations,''
Primakov said. This, he said, ``is not to our liking or yours.''
	   Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, said on Friday
that the government must act to stem the flow of dollars from
Russia.
	   Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov were in
Washington Saturday for the annual meeting of the International
Monetary Fund, where they plan to spell out the measures Russia is
taking to bail out its finance system.
	   Russia wants the IMF to release the second dlrs 4.3 billion
installment of a loan that was approved in July, a month before the
country's economy crashed and the government effectively defaulted
on its foreign loans.
	   IMF officials have said they want the Russian government to come
up with a sound economic program before the installment is given,
and have made it clear that currency controls and boosting the
money supply by printing rubles are not acceptable.

Scientists to take submarine to study underwater volcanoes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Scientists from a joint German-New
Zealand project leave Auckland on Sunday with a small submarine to
resume a study of underwater volcanoes.
	   Expedition members on the German research vessel Sonne will
conduct manned dives with the submersible Jago, which has a diving
capacity of 1,300 feet (400 meters).
	   The dive sites will include the underwater Rumble 3 volcano, 125
miles (200 km) due north of East Cape, and a series of hydrothermal
vent locations near White Island, off the Bay of Plenty coast.
	   The dives are part of the project's second stage, which ends in
Wellington on Oct. 15.
	   The project involves five German universities and three New
Zealand groups _ the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric
Research (NIWA), the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences,
and Auckland University.
	   NIWA scientist Ian Wright said new and exciting discoveries were
made during the project's first leg, which included a journey from
Suva, Fiji, through the Kermadec Islands to Auckland to map the sea
floor.
	   He said the results had significantly increased understanding of
active volcanic systems associated with the ``ring of fire''
between Tonga and New Zealand.
	   One of the most exciting finds was the discovery of active,
high-temperature hydrothermal vent fields within the Brothers
volcano, 185 miles (300 km) north of New Zealand. The volcano was
discovered only in 1994.
	   Photographs and temperature measurements produced evidence of
active black smoker chimneys within the caldera, or cauldron-like
cavity on the summit, in water depths of up to a mile (1,600
meters).
	   ``These sites are the first active black smokers discovered in
New Zealand waters and represent a very rare number worldwide in
this type of volcanic setting,'' Wright said.
	   He said video footage and photos indicated that unique species
are associated with the vent sites.
	   Kiel University professor Peter Stoffler said what surprised him
was the amount and variety of marine life in the area.

Singapore criticizes Malaysian police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore criticized Malaysian police on
Saturday for conducting interviews in the city-state without
informing authorities here first.
	   Malaysian police went to Singapore on Thursday to question
journalists at U.S.-owned television network CNBC Asia about how
they obtained interviews with jailed politician Anwar Ibahim and
his wife Azizah Ismail.
	   ``It has been a longstanding practice for the police forces from
Singapore and Malaysia to keep each other informed of such
interviews,'' said a statement from Singapore's Police Force.
	   ``We will take the matter up with the Malaysian Police,'' it
added tersely.
	   The Singapore authorities noted that Malaysian police ``do not
have any extra-territorial jurisdiction in Singapore,'' and that
``no one in Singapore can be compelled to be interviewed or give
any statement to any foreign police officers.''
	   The Malaysian police initially asked that the journalists from
Singapore-based CNBC come to Malaysia for an interview, vice
president of news programming Chris Blackman told the Associated
Press on Thursday.
	   CNBC refused, but agreed to meet the officers in Singapore.
Police from Johor Bahru, the Malaysian city across the border from
Singapore, interviewed three news anchors and Blackman for half an
hour.
	   ``They had a list of questions wanting us to characterize the
interviews and how we obtained them,'' said Blackman. ``We said we
were not going to comment on any of our news gathering.''
	   The officers never indicated what crime they were investigating,
said Blackman, who called the conversation an ``interview, not a
police report.''
	   Singapore police said Saturday that if the Malaysian police had
informed them before the interviews, it would have avoided ``having
the actions being misconstrued as the exercise of police powers of
investigation outside of jurisdiction.''
	   CNBC broadcast an interview with Anwar and his wife, which was
filmed shortly before the sacked deputy prime minister was
arrested, in Malaysia and across the region last week.
	   Police are investigating a possible case of sedition against
Azizah Ismail because of another interview with CNBC in which she
had expressed fears for her husband's health and mentioned rumors
that police might infect him with the HIV virus to prove
allegations of homosexuality.
	   After leading a series of rallies calling for Mahathir's
retirement, Anwar was arrested Sept. 20. He appeared in court
Tuesday with bruised face, neck and arms and pleaded innocent to
charges of sodomy and abuse of power.

Thai politicians bitterly give up their posts for new partner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has
finalized a new Cabinet lineup to allow another party to join his
coalition, but bruised the feelings of a senior member of his own
party, newspapers reported Saturday.
	   Labor Minster Trairong Suwannakhiri, a longtime colleague of
Chuan in the Democrat Party, was forced to give up his Cabinet post
so a suitable number of seats could be allocated to the
newly-joining Chart Pattana Party.
	   Chuan was forced to bring another party into his government
because of the possibility that some members of an opposition party
who crossed the aisle to give him their support would be tossed out
of their party and then, by law, out of parliament as well.
	   Two Democrats gave up their Cabinet seats so they could be
included in Chart Pattana's quota, but Trairong did so only
grudgingly, press accounts said.
	   Trairong at one point demanded that someone from his faction of
19 lawmakers be included in the new Cabinet lineup, but backed down
after Chuan threatened to resign, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   ``I'm not going to die,'' The Nation newspaper quoted Trairong
as saying.
	   The Chart Pattana Party will be getting nine Cabinet seats,
including the public health, labor, industry and university affairs
ministries, The Nation reported.
	   Adding the CPP to the six-party coalition will substantially
increase the government's thin majority in Parliament and
strengthen its ability to push through programs to tackle the
country's economic crisis.
	   The ruling coalition presently holds 207 seats in the 393-seat
parliament. Chart Pattana has 51 seats.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Prince Bernhard, the father of
Dutch Queen Beatrix, has undergone another surgery to repair a
partially detached retina in his left eye, a Royal House statement
said Saturday.
	   The surgery was performed on Friday, and the prince left the the
hospital on the same day.
	   Prince Bernhard, 87, the husband of former Queen Juliana,
underwent a similar operation earlier this year, but a small
section of the retina became detached again and another surgery was
necessary, according to the statement.
	   Just last month, the popular German-born prince also underwent
surgery to remove scar tissue from his bladder. Earlier this year,
he had another operation to treat an enlargement of the prostate.

Death toll rises to 100 in Indonesian serial killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The death toll from a string suspected
black magic killings in Indonesia jumped to 100 when the bodies of
another eight victims were discovered, a news report said Saturday.
	   The knife-wielding killers, wearing ninja-like black dress and
masks, have attacked victims at night over the past two months. The
motives behind the dozens of killings were not clear, but police
say the killers have accused their victims of being ``sorcerers.''
	   Police in the regency of Banyuwangi, about 830 kilometers (518
miles) east of Jakarta, have formed a task force to guard against
further killings, the official Antara news agency reported.
	   The bodies of eight additional victims were found over the past
few days in the outskirts of Jember, a neighborhood town about 60
kilometers (40 miles) of Banyuwangi, Antara said.
	   The discoveries of the bodies brought the total death toll to
100 and marked the spreading of the killings to another town.
Victims were stabbed in the abdomen and neck.
	   Antara said police on Thursday arrested three truck-loads of
suspects on the way to a police station where four other suspects
were detained.
	   Police Maj. Gen. Moch Dayat was quoted as saying there were no
killings the night after the arrests.
	   ``Most likely there are intellectual authors ... who incite
people to kill,'' Dayat said.
	   According to Antara, people have also been calling for police
action following the murder of Muslim preachers in several villages
apparently linked to the black magic slayings.
	   A Muslim boarding school principal, Imron Mursid, said 20
possible other targets managed to escape by taking refuge to nearby
scattered villages in the district, Antara said.
	   Police and local Muslim youths have intensified night patrols
against attack on local leaders and Muslim preachers and boarding
schools.
	   Earlier reports said the killings were conducted by a
well-organized group that was paid up to 1 million rupiah (dlrs 90)
per victim.

<TEXT>
	   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) _ With his New York Yankees teammates
celebrating all around him, Tim Raines climbed atop a picnic table
and made a special toast to the one guy missing the party.
	   ``Straw really wanted this and this one's for him,'' Raines
said, dedicating to Darryl Strawberry the Yankees' 4-0 victory over
the Texas Rangers early today that completed a sweep of their AL
division series.
	   Raines' words were met with cheers, a big swig and the spraying
of champagne. And why not? After the 36 hours the Yankees had been

	   Players learned just before batting practice Thursday that the
36-year-old slugger has colon cancer. On Friday, their mood
lightened when Strawberry sent them a videotaped pep talk urging
them to ``go get 'em,'' but then they had to wait out a three-hour,
16-minute rain delay before finishing their mission.
	   ``I don't think anyone knew how to react,'' winning pitcher
David Cone said of the celebration. ``It was nice to see the guys
let go a little bit _ not too much, but just right.''
	   Strawberry watched the game from his New York hospital room.
He's scheduled to undergo surgery this afternoon. The Yankees were
flying back around the same time.
	   New York plays the winner of the Boston-Cleveland series in the
AL championship series, starting Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium.
The Indians beat the Red Sox 4-3 Friday to take a 2-1 lead, and
Game 4 is today.
	   The Yankees' 3-0 start to the postseason enhances their claim to
being one of baseball's greatest teams ever. They won an AL-record
114 games in the regular season and are eight victories from a
second World Series championship in three years.
	   Shane Spencer has emerged as the latest secret to New York's
success. After blowing onto the scene with three grand slams in the
last few weeks of the season, he hit two in this series, including
a three-run shot Friday, prompting Torre to refer to Spencer as
``Roy Hobbs.''
	   ``If I'm dreaming, I don't want to wake up,'' Torre said.
 &UR; Indians 4, Red Sox 3
	   In Boston, while dlrs 75 million man Pedro Martinez watches from
the dugout, wishing he were on the mound, one-game winner Pete
Schourek faced the task of saving the Boston Red Sox season today.
	   Leaving himself wide open to second-guessers, manager Jimy
Williams decided to go with a rested pitcher who has been hot
rather than his best pitcher on three days rest for the first time
this season.
	   ``I'll live with it,'' Williams said, ``regardless of what other
people believe.''
	   The burden to avoid elimination fell on Schourek on Friday when
the Red Sox dropped a 4-3 decision to Cleveland to fall behind 2-1
in the best-of-5 AL division series. The Indians hit four solo
homers and got eight strong innings from Charles Nagy.
	   That means the Red Sox must win today against Bartolo Colon. If
they do, they must win again Sunday in Cleveland, and Williams'
controversial move will pay off with Martinez pitching Game 5 on
his usual four days rest.
	   ``I felt fine'' throwing on the side Thursday, said Martinez,
the Game 1 winner Tuesday who was eager to pitch today. But
Williams' decision ``makes sense. He's protecting me. It's for the
good of the team.''
	   Schourek, 1-3 since being obtained from Houston on Aug. 6,
actually has pitched better than Martinez recently with a 1.90 ERA
in his last four starts, down from 7.64 in his other four starts
with Boston.
	   Martinez won the NL Cy Young award last season, signed a
six-year, dlrs 75 million deal after being traded by Montreal and
finished at 19-7. But he was 1-3 with a 4.15 ERA in five starts in
September.
	   ``When you have your ace, you try to get him pitching as much as
possible,'' Schourek said. ``I am confident enough to do the same
kind of job. I might not be as dominant (but) I can win a game for
this team.''

Georges goes down in history as `the hurricane that wouldn't die'
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JAMES ANDERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ It plowed over and past 17
Caribbean islands, crashing into the lives of more than 30 million
people.
	   As each island fell prey to Hurricane Georges' battering winds,
the casualties mounted.
	   They are mounting still. And as they do, island nations are
coming to grips with lost harvests, wrecked government buildings,
lost tourist income and sudden populations of newly homeless.
	   Many past hurricanes damaged only a few islands. Repairs were
often quick.
	   Georges was different. It swept past island after island in the
northern Caribbean, causing billions of dollars in destruction and
killing at least 400 people.
	   In some nations, like tiny St. Kitts, Georges ruined the crucial
winter tourism season and sugar crop on which the islanders stake
their lives.
	   In the Dominican Republic, the immediate concern is survival.
More than a week after Georges' 110 mph (177 kph) winds hit,
searchers were still looking for survivors in towns swamped by
flooding, or combing through deep muck in the grim task of finding
the dead.
	   The numbers of homeless are staggering: More than 100,000 in the
Dominican Republic, 18,000 and counting in Haiti, at least 17,000
in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, and 3,000 in St. Kitts _ a
tenth of that island's population.
	   Along with shelter, the refugees need food, water, ice, clothing
_ needs that have overwhelmed the region's small economies and
taxed the disaster response capabilities of the United States,
France and other donor nations.
	   Damage to popular hotels like Puerto Rico's bluff-top El
Conquistador Resort, and splintered windows in oceanfront
condominiums, underscore a physical and economic vulnerability that
the Caribbean's people know but would rather forget.
	   There was a surprise bright spot: The U.S. Virgin Islands _
battered by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and 1995's Marilyn, which
destroyed 80 percent of the homes on St. Thomas _ emerged
relatively unscathed despite being in Georges' path.
	   ``It's a miracle,'' crowed Elizabeth Armstrong, general manager
of the Buccaneer Hotel on St. Croix.
	   Still, Armstrong worries tourists will be scared away from the
Virgin Islands by Georges' rampage elsewhere. ``It was such a big
storm that I'm afraid people will believe the whole Caribbean was
damaged,'' Armstrong said.
	   Much of it was. Airline service and shipping were disrupted.
Entire islands plunged into darkness _ including Puerto Rico and
its 4 million people _ and thousands of businesses closed.
	   The storm's economic cost has yet to be calculated. In Puerto
Rico alone, property damage has surpassed dlrs 2 billion.
	   Without power, food spoiled in refrigerators, and fights broke
out in hours-long ice lines. Beneath a canopy of suddenly bright
stars over San Juan, candles flickered in windows and drivers
negotiated streets made unfamiliar by fallen trees and the
enveloping dark.
	   Given the Caribbean's dependence on tourism _ it earns dlrs 14
billion a year and employs half a million people _ promoters are
emphasizing the rapid rebuilding in such places as Puerto Rico and
Antigua. And they note that in the Windward Islands in the
southeastern Caribbean and in Jamaica, it is business as usual.
	   In San Juan, giant white cruise ships, their lights blazing
across San Juan Bay, have resumed their weekly visits. Spectacular
pink and purple sunsets have returned, a dramatic backdrop to the
committed navy of surfers and boogie boarders riding the waves off
Condado beach. Old San Juan's blue cobblestone streets are bustling
again with strollers and shoppers.
	   Still, Antigua, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and
St. Kitts could lose tourism in coming months, said Michael Spinks
of the Barbados-based Caribbean Tourism Organization.
	   Last year, more than 1.7 million non-cruise tourists visited the
Dominican Republic, and Cuba and Puerto Rico welcomed more than 1.1
million each. St. Kitts and Nevis earned more than dlrs 25 million
from tourists.

	   Things could have been worse. Georges flirted with catastrophic
150 mph (240 kph) winds over the Atlantic, but entered the
Caribbean near Guadeloupe in a somewhat diminished state.
	   Still, by the time Georges left Cuba four days and 1,200 miles
(1,900 kilometers) later, even the usually stoic National Weather
Service was calling Georges ``the hurricane that just won't die.''
	   A high pressure system dubbed the Bermuda High kept Georges on
its destructive east-to-west track, said meteorologist Jim Lushine
at the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   So instead of striking an island or two and then spinning
northward out of the region as hurricanes generally do, Georges hit
again and again.
	   It smashed public housing in Antigua, swamped the beaches of
Guadeloupe and splintered the glass walls of St. Kitts' new airport
terminal.
	   ``Hurricane mash up my life,'' Verna McHenry said through tears
while she picked through the soiled, sodden remains of her home on
Antigua.
	   In Puerto Rico, where three people were killed, the squatter
community of Diamond Point kept its dazzling hilltop view of the
sea but little else. Georges smashed its dozens of squatter homes.
In its wake, strangers and neighbors banded together to clear
debris, stand in tedious lines for ice, water, propane and
batteries and carry food to the needy.
	   Crossing the Mona Passage, Georges bore down on Hispaniola, an
impoverished island of 15 million shared by Haiti and the Dominican
Republic. Its substandard housing proved no match for 110 mph (177
kph) winds, and emergency officials seemed unprepared for the
disaster.
	   Fed by up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, rivers swelled
into mile-wide (1 1/2-kilometer-wide) torrents that swamped
villages, entombed dozens of people under tons of mud in a
Dominican shelter and left thousands stranded for days. Helicopters
had to drop food rations to survivors.
	   In Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital, officials opened some
shelters only after Georges was pelting the city with sheets of
rain and dangerous flying debris.
	   ``They were overconfident,'' said Hugh Parmer, head of disaster
relief for the U.S. Agency for International Development. ``When
the thing hit, they were totally unprepared to respond.''
	   The United States shipped more than dlrs 500,000 of supplies,
including plastic sheeting to roof thousands of homes. U.S.
helicopters are helping deliver supplies to victims.
	   Authorities also seemed unprepared in Haiti, where heavy rain
flooded the Artibonite Valley, the country's breadbasket.
	   ``We're trying to save what we can,'' said farmer Jean Roberto
Jean-Baptiste, working in a flooded rice paddy.
	   Georges left Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation,
utterly dependent on foreign aid to help storm victims. The
Dominican Republic, considered one of the region's up-and-coming
economic and political players, suffered a blow to its development.
	   Fidel Castro seemed relieved in Cuba, where only five people
were killed after evacuations to safe zones. ``The first victory
was to reduce the losses,'' Castro proclaimed.
	   The same can't be said for the Dominican Republic.
	   Asked how many people died in his country, the Dominican health
undersecretary, Victor Terrero, replied: ``I'll confess something
to you. I have no idea.''

Malaysians double-click to the Internet with Anwar protest

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Deprived of a voice in
state-controlled newspapers and television, supporters of
Malaysia's jailed opposition leader have turned to the Internet to
air their views.
	   Although the government said police would ``check every bit of
information and leaflet'' posted on the Internet, Malaysia's sole
Internet provider acknowledged Friday the medium is ``impossible to
control.''
	   Jailed, beaten and facing trial on 10 sexual misconduct and
corruption charges, ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is a
political underdog in Malaysia.
	   In the realm of cyberspace, though, he's top dog.
	   Within hours of Anwar's recent speech accusing Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad of cruelty and insanity, dozens of boot-legged
recordings had been posted onto new websites hatched by supporters.
	   Among the hottest images now making the Internet rounds are
several news-photo versions of Anwar's badly bruised eye, which he
claims was inflicted by police during his first night of detention.
	   Most pro-Anwar sites also contain his speeches, private letters
to Mahathir, clippings of foreign news reports and prose scorching
the 72-year old prime minister.
	   Most of the Internet content about Anwar is false or
unverifiable, but the medium is tough to rein in, said Azzman
Shariffadeen, head of Mimos, the company that set up Malaysia's
Internet infrastructure.
	   ``No website has been blocked or censored by the government,''
he said.
	   Shortly after Anwar's arrest, one of the former leader's aides
bragged that they had set up dozens of sites offshore, beyond the
reach of the Malaysian government.
	   Malaysian journalist M.G.G. Pillai, who runs a popular website
on local politics, isn't surprised by the aggressive march toward
cyberspace.
	   ``When you're in the opposition and you have no access to
resources and media, then you end up making use of what's available
to air your grouses,'' he said, noting that membership on his site
has soared by 40 percent since Anwar's ouster.
	   The cyber explosion is a boon to most middle-class Malaysians,
who are leery of local media.
	   ``I've finally given up reading local newspapers. They're so
skewed,'' said Michael Chan, a lawyer who upgraded his computer
with a high-speed modem the day after Anwar was arrested on Sept.
20.
	   Chan uses the modem to download pictures of balaclava-clad
police in bulletproof jackets busting down Anwar's front door
before bundling him off to jail.
	   Occasionally, he receives e-mail calling for organized rallies
at the National Mosque and nearby Independence Square, where
hundreds of protesters have been arrested by police. The advertised
demonstrations don't always materialize.
	   Other e-mails call for ``silent protests.'' Malaysians are being
urged on the Internet now to switch off all lights for 10 minutes
on Oct. 6 to declare their ``state of sorrow, sadness and
darkness'' over national injustice.

Palestinians urge Israel to approach new talks without `tricks'
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In advance of a visit next week by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Palestinians on
Saturday urged Israel to avoid ``delaying tricks'' they said have
so far prevented the two sides from reaching an accord.
	   Meanwhile, a small-scale clash broke out Saturday in the divided
West Bank town of Hebron, where Israeli soldiers fired rubber
bullets at a small group of stone-throwers.
	   It has been a tense week in Hebron, which is home to 450 Jewish
settlers and 130,000 Palestinians and a frequent flashpoint for
violence.
	   On Friday, seven Palestinians were injured, one seriously, in
clashes with Israeli soldiers. The Israeli-controlled center of
Hebron has been under curfew since Wednesday, when two grenades
were thrown at Israeli security forces, wounding 22 people.
	   Albright is to arrive in the Middle East on Tuesday for two days
of talks to prepare for a summit meeting in Washington on Oct.
15-19.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Friday that the United
States was trying to coax a pledge from Israel to ease settlement
activity in exchange for assurances from the Palestinians that they
will not encourage illegal construction.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet, meanwhile, said it would call on its
negotiators to ``work with all their ability'' to reach an accord.
But in a statement Saturday following their late-night meeting on
Friday, Palestinian ministers also called on Israel to approach the
new round of talks ``without the delaying tricks of the past.''
	   Israeli officials have said U.S.-brokered talks earlier this
week brought some advances toward a deal for an Israeli pullback
from the West Bank.
	   The latest peace efforts are shadowed by what Israel says is the
serious danger of new attacks by Islamic militants.
	   Israel closed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza Strip to
try to stave off what Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said were
plans for an ``unprecedented, horrific'' attack.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has killed scores of
Israelis in suicide bombings since 1994, vowed to carry out attacks
after Israeli soldiers killed two of the group's leaders last
month.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Friday that
security forces could not be totally effective in combating terror
groups.
	   ``We have to know that, during this fight, we will take some
blows,'' Netanyahu said on public television. ``We are working
against those murderers so there will be less attacks or none at
all.''
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the Palestinian
Authority has taken sporadic steps to control Hamas, but ``it's far
short of what we would like.''
	   Fogel warned that an attack would hurt the peace process. In the
past, Israel has suspended talks with the Palestinians after
large-scale attacks by Palestinian extremists.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian voters chose Saturday
between a conservative incumbent prime minister promising an
unpopular new tax and a Labor Party that they had cast into the
political wilderness just 2 1/2 years earlier.
	   About 12 million registered voters cast their ballots at
thousands of polling booths in public buildings in towns from the
nation's desert Outback to its tropical north and in its modern,
bustling cities in the southeast.
	   Prime Minister John Howard has staked his government's fate on
what he calls ``economically radical'' tax reforms _ simplifying an
antiquated tax structure that has built up since the 1930s.
	   Whether Howard retains power rests on voters' willingness to
accept a 10 percent tax on all goods and services.
	   Howard's main opponent, Labor Party leader Kim Beazley, is
promising something far less painful: to create 500,000 new jobs.
And he has used a ``no tax'' promise to pull Labor close enough to
smell victory.
	   Labor was thrown out in a landslide victory for Howard in 1996,
and the historical odds are against Beazley.
	   In the early counting after the polls closed, Howard's
conservatives were being hurt by the Labor Party and also by the
right-wing populist One Nation party, which was taking almost 10
percent of the total vote.
	   But with only about 12 percent of the total vote counted, it was
too early to tell if Labor's gains would be enough to take
government from Howard's conservatives, or Howard would prevail
with a reduced majority.
	   Labor must hold all its current electorates and win 27 more to
seize a majority in the House of Representatives, the more powerful
chamber in Australia's bicameral Parliament.
	   If it succeeds, Labor will have achieved the largest comeback in
Australian election history, and Howard's will become the first
single-term government since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
	   Labor and the coalition have been in a dead heat for weeks,
according to the polls.
	   Casting his vote in his west coast electorate, Beazley said he
found the latest poll difficult to believe and predicted there
would be a clear result by late Saturday night.
	   ``We've been there for over a century trying our very best to
represent the views of ordinary Australians. Sometimes we've
succeeded in winning their trust, sometimes we've not,'' Beazley
told reporters.
	   ``I'm just hopeful we have managed it again tonight.''
	   Voting in his Sydney electorate, Howard said he was nervous
about the outcome.
	   ``When you get to this stage you just wait and see what the
result is. I am hopeful but it will be tight. I think I confess to
a few first night nerves,'' Howard said.
	   Currently, Howard's governing conservatives hold 90 seats, Labor
49 and independents eight.
	   Even if Howard retains control in the House of Representatives,
where government is formed, polls have indicated minor parties or
independents again will hold the balance of power in the upper
house, meaning the government may have to negotiate to get bills
passed.
	   Howard has tried to soften his tax plan by linking it to income
tax cuts worth Australian dollars 13 billion (U.S. dlrs 7.6
billion) a year and has promised to abolish a variety of other
wholesale taxes. But the income tax cuts are based on the uncertain
assumption that the Australian economy will continue to grow 3.5
percent a year to keep the federal budget in surplus.
	   Beazley, meanwhile, has promised to create a half-million jobs
in three years and has called for income tax cuts targeting
low-income earners. His proposed cuts would cost Australian dollars
3 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.8 billion), an amount he says would be
affordable even under the IMF's modest growth projections.
	   Tax was a key issue for voters on both sides.
	   ``I don't like any of them but I don't want a GST (goods and
services tax),'' said 30-year-old Chris Ireland when asked why he
voted Labor.
	   ``John Howard has taken the brave approach in taking on reform
of the tax system,'' said Ian Montcrieff, a 73-year-old self-funded
retiree. ``I'm very keen for the tax reforms to come through.''

skiing Saturday, ending a remarkable career in which he won three
Olympic titles and a reputation for explosiveness on and off the
slopes.
	   The Italian known as ``La Bomba'' (The Bomb) released a
statement through the Italian news agency ANSA. Tomba's sister
Alessia, who acts as his spokesperson, said Friday an announcement
was forthcoming, but that the skier would not speak to reporters
about the decision.
	   Tomba, 31, burst onto the scene with a bronze medal at the 1987
World Championships, and went on to capture 1988 Olympic titles in
the slalom and giant slalom. In 1992, he became the first Alpine
skier to win the same Olympic event twice when he took gold in the
giant slalom. Tomba also won silver medals in slalom at the 1992
and 1994 Olympics.
	   Fittingly, Tomba leaves on a winning note. He won the last race
of the 1998 season, the slalom at the World Cup Finals in March,
for his 50th career World Cup win.

Palestinians urge Israel to approach new talks without `tricks'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In advance of a visit next week by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Palestinians on
Saturday urged Israel to avoid ``delaying tricks'' they said have
so far obstructed a new accord.
	   Meanwhile, a small-scale clash broke out Saturday in the divided
West Bank town of Hebron, where Israeli soldiers fired rubber
bullets at a small group of stone-throwers. It has been a tense
week in Hebron, which is home to 450 Jewish settlers and 130,000
Palestinians and a frequent flashpoint for violence.
	   Albright is scheduled to arrive in the Middle East on Tuesday
for two days of talks to prepare for a summit meeting in Washington
on Oct. 15-19.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Friday that the United
States was trying to coax a pledge from Israel to ease settlement
activity in exchange for assurances from the Palestinians that they
will not encourage illegal construction.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet, meanwhile, said it would call on its
negotiators to ``work with all their ability'' to reach an accord.
But in a statement Saturday following their late-night meeting on
Friday, Palestinian ministers also called on Israel to approach the
new round of talks ``without the delaying tricks of the past.''
	   Israeli officials have said U.S.-brokered talks earlier this
week brought some advances toward a deal for an Israeli pullback
from the West Bank.
	   The latest peace efforts are shadowed by what Israel says is the
serious danger of new attacks by Islamic militants.
	   Israel closed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza Strip to
try to stave off what Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said were
plans for an ``unprecedented, horrific'' attack.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has killed scores of
Israelis in suicide bombings since 1994, vowed to carry out attacks
after Israeli soldiers killed two of the group's leaders last
month.

Hospitals open as strike suspended
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Athens, Greece (AP) - Doctors at public hospitals in Athens
returned to work Saturday after their union suspended a lengthy
strike which had seriously disrupted health services in the
capital.
	   The main hospital doctors' union, EINAP, agreed Friday to hold
two weeks of talks with the government before voting on whether to
re-start the protest.
	   Doctors are demanding higher pay and benefits. They say
government reforms to make hospitals more efficient are too hasty
and require more state funding.
	   Only emergency cases were treated during the strikes, held on
and off since Sept. 11. Patients gathered daily outside the closed
hospital gates to plead for treatment.
	   However, five hospitals in greater Athens defied their union's
decision and continued striking.

Ku, Murai share lead in Kosaido Ladies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ICHIHARA, Japan (AP) _ South Korean veteran Ku Ok-hee shot an
even-par 72 Saturday and shared a one-stroke lead with Mayumi Murai
going into the final round of the 60 million yen (dlrs 441,000)
Kosaido Ladies.
	   Murai, an overnight co-leader, went around in 73 for a 36-hole
total of 2-under 142.
	   Ku chipped in a 12-meter (40-foot) wedge shot for birdie on the
par-5 18th that moved her into the tie with her playing partner
Murai, who parred the final hole.
	   Ku, seeking her second title this season and 15th overall on the
Japan tour, had a round of four birdies, two bogeys and a double
bogey over the 6,257-yard (5,694-meter), par-72 Chiba Kosaido
Country Club course.
	   ``The top two money-winners aren't competing here so I'm aiming
for it,'' said Ku, referring to Michiko Hattori, who is leading the
money list, and Akiko Fukushima, who stands behind Hattori.
	   ``There aren't many low scores yielded because of the windy
weather out there. So I'll just try to play in a consistent pace
tomorrow,'' Ku added.
	   Murai, in contention for her first victory in two years and
seventh overall, scattered three birdies, two bogeys and a double
bogey.
	   ``I'm not thinking about winning,'' said Murai, who last won in
the 1996 Chukyo TV-Bridgeston. ``If I do, that would make me
over-swing.''
	   One stroke back at 143 came Aki Takamura, who fired the day's
best round of 69 with five birdies and two bogeys.
	   Kiyoe Yamazaki shot a 73 and Nayoko Yoshikawa a 74 to share
fourth at even-par 144.
	   Aiko Takasu, the other overnight co-leader, struggled to a 77
for a share of seventh at 146.
	   A total of 52 survived the cut at 8-over 152.

 &UR; Pope John Paul II beatifies controversial World War II cardinal
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with beatification, other details, Changes
byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By VICTOR L. SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARIJA BISTRICA, Croatia (AP) _ Bestowing on him the ``radiant
badge of martyrdom,'' Pope John Paul II on Saturday honored
Croatia's World War II cardinal, a hero to Roman Catholics, but
long a symbol of divisions in the Balkans.
	   Before a huge crowd spread over several muddy hillsides
overlooking Croatia's main shrine to the Virgin Mary, John Paul
beatified Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, elevating him to the last
step before possible sainthood.
	   More than 400,000 people stood solemnly under damp trees at the
open-air site, as far as a kilometer (half-mile) from the altar.
	   John Paul appealed to a country that has suffered from war and
ethnic divisions ``to forgive and reconcile and to purify one's
memory of hatred'' and ``the desire for revenge.''
	   The pope said Stepinac ``having endured in his own body and his
own spirit the atrocities of the communist system is now entrusted
to the memory of his fellow countrymen with the radiant badge of
martyrdom.''
	   Stepinac was hailed as a hero by Catholics for his resistance to
communism and refusal to separate the Croatian church from the
Vatican. But his beatification, the last step before possible
sainthood, is controversial because many Serbs and Jews accuse him
of sympathizing with the Nazis.
	   While serving as Zagreb's archbishop in 1941, Stepinac supported
Croatia's German-backed fascist puppet government led by dictator
Ante Pavelic. By 1942, however, Stepinac denounced the regime's
genocidal policies, which led to the extermination of thousands of
Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croat opponents.
	   He died at 62 in 1960 while under house arrest following his
conviction on charges of collaborating with the Nazis. Stepinac's
own notes and recent studies say he spoke out against the
atrocities, and worked to save lives, but many Serbs still consider
him a war criminal.
	   The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a U.S.-based Nazi-hunting group,
also had asked the Vatican to postpone the beatification pending
further study of the cardinal's actions, although some local Jews
defended Stepinac.
	   John Paul addressed the criticism in his homily, quoting from a
1943 address by the cardinal condemning injustices and the killing
of innocents. He said Stepinac's figure summed up ``the whole
tragedy which befell the Croatian people and Europe in the course
of this century marked by the three great evils of fascism,
national socialism and communism.''
	   ``He is now in the joy of heaven, surrounded by those who, like
him, fought the good fight, purifying their faith in the crucible
of suffering,'' said John Paul, speaking from an altar before a
5-meter (15-foot) high portrait of Stepinac.
	   The pope, who battled communism in his own Polish homeland,
stressed Stepinac's treatment by Yugoslavia's communist regime
after the war, saying the last 15 years of his life ``were a
continual succession of trials.''
	   Some 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million population is Catholic,
and the Vatican looks at the country as a Catholic bastion in the
Balkans, amid Orthodox Christians and Muslims.
	   Stipe Dorotic, a 38-year electrician from eastern Croatia, who
attended the ceremony said hoped that the beatification ``will
enable Croats to face the future with more confidence and faith.''
	   Croatia was a part of communist-run Yugoslavia until 1991, when
it proclaimed independence. The Vatican was one of the first states
to recognize its independence.
	   The secession of Croatia, and later of neighboring Bosnia, led
to bloody wars in which tens of thousands of people were killed.
	   It is John Paul's second visit to Croatia, following a 1994
pilgrimage. He flew to Sarajevo last year, realizing his desire to
pay tribute to those who suffered during the war.
	   He also toured Slovenia in the former Yugoslavia, but has not
been to Serbia, apparently because of resistance from Orthodox
leaders.

her opposition to Asian immigration and social programs for
Aborigines. Former fish-and-chips shop owner whose previous
political experience was as a city councilor.

urged militant unionists at Philippine Airlines to accept a vote by
workers approving a 10-year no-strike deal to revive the debt-laden
airline.
	   On Friday, about 61 percent of the members of PAL's largest
union accepted the proposal to suspend collective bargaining in
exchange for 20 percent of the company's stock and seats on its
board.
	   Hardline union members say they will file charges questioning
the legality of agreement, but Estrada urged them to accept the
referendum results.
	   ``It's very clear that majority have agreed to it and voted
freely,'' said Estrada during his weekly radio program. ``Everybody
has to sacrifice. Labor and management should cooperate at this
time of crisis.''
	   Following the outcome of the referendum, PAL said it can resume
flights to 14 domestic destinations next Wednesday and to nine
international destinations within several weeks.
	   It was the second time that the 6,700 members of PAL's largest
union have voted on the rescue plan. Last week, they rejected the
proposal, forcing the airline to shut down and leaving much of the
country without air service.
	   Estrada assured workers that he will defend their rights during
the 10-year CBA suspension. The Philippine president also assured
the International Labor Organization the proposed suspension is
only a temporary measure and would help the government cope with
the Asian crisis.
	   ``It is not true that I am anti-labor,'' he said. ``This is only
a temporary and will not deny workers' rights.''
	   The union had been sharply split over the proposal, with
militant members saying a suspension of the bargaining agreement
would violate workers' rights.
	   Many union members had believed the government would not allow
the 57-year-old flag carrier to close. But when government-enlisted
foreign carriers began flying some domestic routes on Monday, union
leaders reversed their position and agreed to accept the management
plan.
	   The agreement must be formally endorsed by workers, regulators
and PAL's creditors.
	   Management said at least 2,000 workers will be recalled to
handle domestic operations, and most of the airline's 8,600 current
workers will be recalled once international flights are fully
operational.
	   Asia's currency crisis hit shortly after PAL launched a dlrs 4
billion modernization program, greatly inflating the amount of
money it must repay to overseas creditors. It has been unable to
make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of debt.

BMW announces plans to set up own assembly plant in Thailand
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ German automaker BMW announced Saturday
it will set up a wholly-owned manufacturing plant in eastern
Thailand to assemble BMW and Rover group vehicles.
	   It will also establish a wholesale subsidiary, Bayerische
Motoren Werke (Thailand), to handle distribution of its vehicles,
BMW executives said at a news conference.
	   BMW's new plant, representing an initial investment of more than
1 billion baht (dlrs 25.3 million), will be located at an
industrial park in Thailand's Eastern Seaboard. It is scheduled to
start operations in early 2000, employing 250 people in vehicle
assembly during the first year of production.
	   By 2004, it is slated to have 500-600 employees and an annual
capacity of 10,000 units.
	   By establishing a wholly-owned manufacturing company _ and a
wholesale subsidiary which is legally a joint venture but in
practice controlled by BMW _ the automaker has substantially
altered its 35-year relationship with its former Thai importer and
distributor, the locally-owned Thai Yarnyon. The Thai company has
also been assembling some BMW models since 1973, steadily expanding
capacity.
	   BMW board member Wolfgang Reitzle said his company ``will
maintain the relationship and ensure business of the group's
long-term partners in Thailand,'' including Thai Yarnyon, by
sourcing painted bodies from their existing facilities for final
assembly at the new plant.
	   ``In the past, both partners have substantially invested in
these facilities to meet BMW's worldwide quality standards,'' he
said.
	   But concern has been expressed in some quarters that BMW may
have negotiated too hard a bargain.
	   Thai Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul wrote a letter to
BMW Chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder in January describing the
decision to establish BMW Thailand as ``encouraging news,'' but
noting that ``unfortunately, it does not yet include the
contemplated participation of your local assembly and distribution
partner, Thai Yarnyon.''
	   Thai Yarnyon has no equity interest in the new ventures, whose
Thai partners exist for legal reasons but are not, apparently,
actual investors.
	   According to auto industry sources, a joint venture agreement
concerning production was signed in March 1997 between BMW and Thai
Yarnyon but was abrogated by BMW shortly afterwards for reasons
that are unclear.
	   In June this year, the German-Thai Chamber of Commerce also sent
a letter to BMW's management, expressing concern that its dealings
with Thai Yarnyon could become a source of ill-will, and urging the
German company to seek a ``middle way'' on the issue of purchasing
the outstanding stock of 3,000 BMW cars held by the Thai company.
	   The stock represents a major financial burden for Thai Yarnyon,
since the vehicles were purchased from BMW using bank credit.
Thailand's economic crisis has slowed sales to a crawl, disrupting
cash-flow and making it difficult to repay the loans.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian voters chose Saturday
between a conservative incumbent prime minister promising an
unpopular new tax and a Labor Party that they had cast into the
political wilderness just 2 1/2 years earlier.
	   About 12 million registered voters cast their ballots at
thousands of polling booths in public buildings in towns from the
nation's desert Outback to its tropical north and in its modern,
bustling cities in the southeast.
	   Early returns indicated voters had deserted the government, but
not in sufficient numbers for the opposition Labor Party to capture
the 27 additional parliamentary seats it needs to win government
outright.
	   With about 57 percent of the all votes counted, political
analysts starting saying that it appeared impossible for Labor to
win, and the conservative coalition of Prime Minister John Howard
would be re-elected with a reduced majority in the House of
Representatives.
	   The detailed ongoing computer tally by the Australian
Broadcasting Corp. predicted a coalition win by eight seats.
	   Howard staked his government's fate on what he calls
``economically radical'' tax reforms _ simplifying an antiquated
tax structure that has built up since the 1930s.
	   Whether Howard retains power rests on voters' willingness to
accept a 10 percent tax on all goods and services.
	   Howard's main opponent, Labor Party leader Kim Beazley, promised
something far less painful: to create 500,000 new jobs. And he used
a ``no tax'' promise to pull Labor close enough to smell victory.
	   Labor was thrown out in a landslide victory for Howard in 1996,
and the historical odds are against Beazley.
	   In the early counting after the polls closed, Howard's
conservatives were being hurt by the Labor Party and also by the
right-wing populist One Nation party, which was taking almost 10
percent of the total vote.
	   Labor must hold all its current electorates and win 27 more to
seize a majority in the House of Representatives, the more powerful
chamber in Australia's bicameral Parliament.
	   If it succeeds, Labor will have achieved the largest comeback in
Australian election history, and Howard's will become the first
single-term government since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
	   Labor and the coalition have been in a dead heat for weeks,
according to the polls.
	   Casting his vote in his west coast electorate, Beazley said he
found the latest poll difficult to believe and predicted there
would be a clear result by late Saturday night.
	   ``We've been there for over a century trying our very best to
represent the views of ordinary Australians. Sometimes we've
succeeded in winning their trust, sometimes we've not,'' Beazley
told reporters.
	   ``I'm just hopeful we have managed it again tonight.''
	   Voting in his Sydney electorate, Howard said he was nervous
about the outcome.
	   ``When you get to this stage you just wait and see what the
result is. I am hopeful but it will be tight. I think I confess to
a few first night nerves,'' Howard said.
	   Currently, Howard's governing conservatives hold 90 seats, Labor
49 and independents eight.
	   Even if Howard retains control in the House of Representatives,
where government is formed, polls have indicated minor parties or
independents again will hold the balance of power in the upper
house, meaning the government may have to negotiate to get bills
passed.
	   Howard has tried to soften his tax plan by linking it to income
tax cuts worth Australian dollars 13 billion (U.S. dlrs 7.6
billion) a year and has promised to abolish a variety of other
wholesale taxes. But the income tax cuts are based on the uncertain
assumption that the Australian economy will continue to grow 3.5
percent a year to keep the federal budget in surplus.
	   Beazley, meanwhile, has promised to create a half-million jobs
in three years and has called for income tax cuts targeting
low-income earners. His proposed cuts would cost Australian dollars
3 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.8 billion), an amount he says would be
affordable even under the IMF's modest growth projections.
	   Tax was a key issue for voters on both sides.
	   ``I don't like any of them but I don't want a GST (goods and
services tax),'' said 30-year-old Chris Ireland when asked why he
voted Labor.
	   ``John Howard has taken the brave approach in taking on reform
of the tax system,'' said Ian Montcrieff, a 73-year-old self-funded
retiree. ``I'm very keen for the tax reforms to come through.''

Kohl honored at last German Unity Day as chancellor

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Germany marked its last unification day
holiday Saturday with Helmut Kohl as chancellor by honoring him for
his crowning achievement in office: reunifying Germany.
	   Defeated last week in his bid for an unprecedented fifth term,
Kohl attended the ceremony at the Hanover congress center, but did
not speak.
	   In a statement issued earlier, he praised all that Germany had
accomplished in bringing east and west together since 1990's
unification.
	   ``What we've attained with each other in the past eight years is
unprecedented in history,'' he said.
	   Others singled Kohl out, though, for leading the effort to bring
divided Germany together while reassuring worried neighbors like
France and Poland that a reunited Germany would remain peaceful.
	   ``I think this is a good moment to remind people about that,''
chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder said, expressing his ``respect''
for Kohl. ``And I'm sure the people in Germany won't forget it.''
	   Schroeder, who led the Social Democrats' defeat of Kohl last
week, played host to the national celebrations in his role as
president of parliament's upper house.
	   Czech President Vaclav Havel, the guest of honor, said German
unification ``was good for the whole world'' because it meant the
end of an ``evil''' system of communism.
	   But Schroeder noted the economic and social upheaval that
followed the demise of East Germany has given rise to another
danger: growing support for neo-Nazi ideas, especially among
disoriented youth.
	   Germany can be proud that no far-right party even came close to
winning parliamentary seats in last week's election, he said.
	   ``But that shouldn't lead us to lose sight of the causes'' that
lead young people above all to vote for such parties, he said.
	   ``Radicalism always feeds itself on the fears and insecurities
in times of dramatic change'' _ not just unification, but the
tougher competition brought about by globalization.
	   Schroeder, who was expected to be sworn in as chancellor at the
end of the month, called for more attention to history and to more
job and training opportunities for young people.
	   The ceremony was preceded by a political fight over an original
musical work mixing portions of the German national anthem and the
one used in communist East Germany.
	   Conservatives accused Schroeder of desecrating the national
anthem and insulting the victims of East Germany's totalitarian
regime. Bavarian leaders boycotted the ceremony.
	   But even Kohl clapped politely when the composition including
the anthem was played. And German President Roman Herzog dismissed
the fuss as overblown.
	   ``Our state, and it's symbols, can endure that,'' he said.
	   The people of former East Germany will be remembered not by
their old anthem, he said, but by the chant heard during the
candlelight marches that eventually brought down the communist
leaders: ``We are the people.''
	   The audience applauded in response.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Her awestruck face hidden behind a
colorful veil, an illiterate woman stepped in front of a computer
screen in a remote Indian rural district.
	   Chameli Devi blushed with amazement in the small public
telephone office in Jaunpur Friday when she saw and heard a message
from her husband, Ram Singh, who had recorded it earlier from a
similar phone booth in Bombay, 1,240 kilometers (770 miles) away.
	   The couple inaugurated the world's first commercial video
e-mail, a facility developed by the National Association of
Software and Service Companies, that will eventually enable
millions of poor, illiterate people to communicate cheaply, said
Dewang Mehta, NASSCOM's executive director.
	   ``We are stepping into a revolution, this has not been tried
anywhere in the world,'' Mehta told The Associated Press Saturday.
	   For 15 rupees (35 cents), the facility transmits a three-minute
video to e-mail accounts, just like text messages.
	   Devi, who works in her fields and knows nothing of computers or
e-mail, paid the booth owner five rupees (11 cents) extra to open a
standing e-mail account, including her husband's picture that is
stored on a hard disk at the booth.
	   Until now, Devi had to wait weeks for surface mail from her
husband, whom she sees only once a year.
	   The equipment, likely to be installed in several public booths
across India this month, also will provide e-mail messages in
Hindi, India's national language, Mehta said.
	   NASSCOM tested its video e-mail facility by inviting 18 Bombay
taxi drivers who came from Jaunpur, a town in the northern state of
Uttar Pradesh, to record messages for their wives and children,
Mehta said.
	   The government's Information Technology Task Force, to which
Mehta belongs, has suggested various means of propelling large
numbers of Indians toward the global information revolution which
has so far touched only a fraction of the country's nearly 1
billion people.
	   Despite a boom in the use of computers, India has only 2.3
million personal computers and about 130,000 Internet subscribers,
with each connection being shared by up to five people, NASSCOM
said.
	   The Communications Ministry has said it would provide all
district hubs across the country with Internet connectivity.
	   ``Poor, illiterate villagers who don't have telephones, who
don't write letters, can now walk up to the phone booth and dictate
Internet messages,'' Mehta said.
	   Telephones have long been considered a luxury in India, where
about half of the population does not have a connection. Recent
easing of government regulations has led to a proliferation of
public telephone booths.

Iran recalled diplomats from Pakistan for security reasons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has recalled its diplomats from
Pakistan because it feared for their safety, Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi said Saturday.
	   The move was the latest deterioration in relations between the
two neighbors, who have competed for influence in Afghanistan.
	   ``There have been many assassinations in Pakistan in the past
few months and a number of Iranians serving in Pakistan have been
killed,'' Kharrazi told the official state-run Tehran radio upon
his return from a session at the United Nations in New York.
	   Kharrazi said the 60 diplomats recalled from various missions in
Pakistan on Thursday would return as soon as security improved.
	   Two Iranian engineers, six students and a cultural
representative have been killed in Pakistan over the past year.
	   Sunni and Shiite Muslim extremist groups in Pakistan are
fighting a bloody sectarian conflict that has intensified in recent
years. Sunni groups blame Iran for helping the Shiite extremists,
while Shiite groups accuse Saudi Arabia of funding Sunni militant
organizations. Both countries deny the allegations.
	   Shiites, a majority in Iran, make up about 15 percent of
Sunni-dominated Pakistan's population.
	   In Afghanistan, Pakistan is widely seen as the principal backer
of the Taliban, which controls 90 percent of the country, while
Iran is suspected of backing the opposition alliance.
	   In other comments, Kharrazi said that Iran had not changed its
stand on British author Salman Rushdie and that it was Britain that
had decided to put the affair behind it and upgrade relations.
	   ``As far as Salman Rushdie is concerned, we did not adopt a new
position. Our position was the same as our officials had repeatedly
stated in the past. In fact, it was the British who decided to
upgrade relations,'' the radio quoted him as saying.
	   Kharrazi had said Iran would not seek to carry out a death
sentence issued in 1989 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in talks
with his British counterpart Robin Cook last month in New York. He
also distanced his government from the dlrs 2.5 million bounty
placed on Rushdie's head by a religious foundation in Iran.
	   The gesture was portrayed as new and significant and both
countries decided to exchange ambassadors.
	   Khomeini had decreed that Rushdie must die for blaspheming Islam
in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   Kharrazi's comments angered hard-liners in Iran, who said the
sentence stands, regardless of the views of the government.
	   Moderate President Mohammad Khatami has been trying to improve
relations with the West since he took office last year.

Iran recalls diplomats from Pakistan for security reasons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has recalled its diplomats from
Pakistan because of fears for their safety, Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi said Saturday.
	   The move was the latest deterioration in relations between the
two neighbors, who have competed for influence in Afghanistan.
	   ``There have been many assassinations in Pakistan in the past
few months and a number of Iranians serving in Pakistan have been
killed,'' Kharrazi told the official state-run Tehran radio upon
his return from a session at the United Nations in New York.
	   Kharrazi said the 60 diplomats recalled from various missions in
Pakistan on Thursday would return as soon as security improved.
	   Two Iranian engineers, six students and a cultural
representative have been killed in Pakistan over the past year.
	   Sunni and Shiite Muslim extremist groups in Pakistan are
fighting a bloody sectarian conflict that has intensified in recent
years. Sunni groups blame Iran for helping the Shiite extremists,
while Shiite groups accuse Saudi Arabia of funding Sunni militant
organizations. Both countries deny the allegations.
	   Shiites, a majority in Iran, make up about 15 percent of
Sunni-dominated Pakistan's population.
	   In Afghanistan, Pakistan is widely seen as the principal backer
of the Taliban, which controls 90 percent of the country, while
Iran is suspected of backing the opposition alliance.
	   In other comments, Kharrazi said that Iran had not changed its
stand on British author Salman Rushdie and that it was Britain that
had decided to put the affair behind it and upgrade relations.
	   ``As far as Salman Rushdie is concerned, we did not adopt a new
position. Our position was the same as our officials had repeatedly
stated in the past. In fact, it was the British who decided to
upgrade relations,'' the radio quoted him as saying.
	   Kharrazi had said Iran would not seek to carry out a death
sentence issued in 1989 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in talks
with his British counterpart Robin Cook last month in New York. He
also distanced his government from the dlrs 2.5 million bounty
placed on Rushdie's head by a religious foundation in Iran.
	   The gesture was portrayed as new and significant and both
countries decided to exchange ambassadors.
	   Khomeini had decreed that Rushdie must die for blaspheming Islam
in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   Kharrazi's comments angered hard-liners in Iran, who said the
sentence stands, regardless of the views of the government.
	   Moderate President Mohammad Khatami has been trying to improve
relations with the West since he took office last year.

Opposition marks anniversary of White House storming

 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Opposition demonstrators marched through Moscow
Saturday to mark the fifth anniversary of the bloody clash between
government forces and opposition lawmakers in the Russian capital.
	   About 1,000 people, waving Soviet-era flags and anti-government
banners, marched from the Lenin monument on Kaluzhskaya Square
along the same route to the Russian White House that protesters
took five years ago, Russian television reported.
	   A separate group of several hundred held a rally at the
Ostankino television broadcasting center, where dozens of people
died in clashes with Interior Ministry troops.
	   The events of Oct. 3-4, 1993, were set off when President Boris
Yeltsin decided to dissolve the conservative, Soviet-era
parliament.
	   Hard-line lawmakers refused to disband and barricaded themselves
inside the White House. The standoff erupted into violence when an
angry mob of supporters broke through police lines into the
building and armed hard-liners later attempted to storm the
Ostankino television broadcasting center.
	   The next day, Yeltsin called in troops and tanks that shelled
parliament and forced his foes to surrender.
	   An estimated 200 people died in the violence.
	   About 350 demonstrators, organized by Communist Party chief
Gennady Zyuganov, gathered earlier Saturday at the television
center to pay tribute to those who died.
	   Anatoly Kluchkov, an organizer of the march to the White House,
the government headquarters that then housed parliament, said
Zyuganov's morning rally had probably caused attendance at his
demonstration to dwindle.
	   ``It would have been better in the evening when the shooting
took place at Ostankino,'' he told reporters.

Skiing great Tomba officially calls it quits
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS detail, background, quote from statement, byline &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Alberto Tomba announced his official retirement from
skiing Saturday, ending a remarkable career in which he won three
Olympic titles and a reputation for explosiveness on and off the
slopes.
	   The man known as ``La Bomba'' (The Bomb) released a statement
through the Italian news agency ANSA. Tomba's sister Alessia Tomba,
who acts as his spokesperson, said Friday an announcement was
forthcoming, but that the skier would not speak to reporters about
the decision.
	   It was a muted end to a loud career.
	   Knocking through gates with the same disdain a boxer shows for
an opponent, Tomba burst onto the scene with a bronze medal at the
1987 World Championships and went on to capture 1988 Olympic titles
in the slalom and giant slalom. In 1992, he became the first Alpine
skier to win the same Olympic event twice when he took gold in the
giant slalom. Tomba also won silver medals in slalom at the 1992
and 1994 Olympics, the first skier with medals at three Winter
Games.
	   The 31-year-old Italian's trophy case also has two gold and
three bronze medals from World Championships, and an overall World
Cup title.
	   He was likely the most outspoken and gregarious skier ever.
	   He dated a Miss Italy, was often spotted at late-night discos
and last year paid a fine for tossing a glass trophy at a
photographer whose shots of Tomba in the nude had appeared in a
magazine.
	   In July, a prosecutor asked for indictments for Tomba and his
parents for tax fraud, alleging the family hid income of about dlrs
12 million from 1990-96.
	   Tomba leaves on a winning note. He won the last race of the 1998
season, the slalom at the World Cup Finals in March, upstaging the
favorites in one final show of flamboyance. It was his 50th career
World Cup win, the second-most of all time.
	   ``Some people say it is better to quit as a winner,'' Tomba said
after that race.
	   A disappointing Nagano Olympics in February _ he hurt his back
in a tumble during the giant slalom _ had fueled speculation Tomba
might quit the sport.
	   ``Up until today, word had not come from me or my family and I
think therefore that only now can this announcement assume its true
meaning,'' Saturday's statement said. ``I reflected a lot before
deciding, but I leave skiing with much affection for all of those
who in these many years followed me and incited me to victory.''
	   Tomba is currently working on his acting debut, a two-part
television movie that will air in Italy next year, according to his
sister. Appropriately, it is an action movie.

Small city gets hands-on preview of Europe's single-currency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos MAD101,102 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MALAGA, Spain (AP) _ The euro, Europe's single currency, arrived
three years early in this southern port city, turning a quiet
suburb far from the world's exchange markets into a modern
financial frontier.
	   For four days this week, the average citizen in the Churriana
suburb got a hands-on preview of what it will be like to handle the
euro that is soon to become the common currency in all but four of
the European Union's 15 countries.
	   Although the new currency is due to be launched on Jan. 1, 1999
and immediately become an optional language for all banking
transactions, the new coins and notes won't actually be available
to the public until 2002.
	   ``We are euro pioneers,'' said Manuel Pavon, 70, as he jingled
the unfamiliar new coins in his pocket before buying a packet of
spinach seeds.
	   Most residents eagerly exchanged their pesetas for a limited run
of euros placed in circulation in Churriana from Wednesday to
Saturday.
	   ``Everyone is very confused, especially older people,'' said
Carolina Canada, 19, one of some 100 uniformed euro-hostesses
deployed in the area to answer questions from bewildered shoppers.
	   Nearly 100 shops, bars, restaurants and market stalls accepted
payment in euros. The national mint issued eight different coins
ranging in value from one cent to two euros, and worth 1.6 million
euros (about dlrs 1.8 million).
	   ``More than half my customers want to pay in euros. They like
the novelty,'' said Ana Maria Carmona, as she sold a large red fish
from her market stall.
	   ``I think it is probably a good thing for the economy but I
can't help feeling that people will lose their difference when they
lose their money,'' said Sandra Rowe, a British expatriate from a
neighboring town.
	   Spain is one of the most enthusiastic participants of European
monetary union that proponents say will stabilize the region's
financial markets, aid trade and stimulate growth, and many Spanish
banks have already begun issuing bilingual personal statements in
pesetas and euros.
	   Few Spaniards voice concern over losing fiscal sovereignty to
the German-based European Central Bank in charge of Europe's answer
to the U.S. dollar to be used by some 300 million people.
	   ``We have been riding in the last carriage for so long, now we
want to be in the main body of the train with everyone else,''
Pavon said, explaining why Churriana appeared to embrace the
concept of the euro so readily.
	   But while Rowe, 56, was one of the few participants in the
project who expressed sadness at the imminent demise of the
traditional peseta, she was not alone in her desire to keep a few
extra euros as souvenirs.
	   ``I'm going to take some euros back to my village to give as
presents to my friends I play dominos with,'' said Francisco
Moreno, a 74-year-old former artichoke farmer.
	   The Spanish government body set up to oversee the transition to
the euro claimed that the range of commercial establishments
involved made Churriana the most extensive euro-trial so far.
	   Spokesman Alfonso Tulla said the organizers had also taken steps
to avoid what happened in similar dry-runs in Italy, Germany and
France, where coin collectors bought up the euros without making
any purchases and rendered the experiment worthless.
	   In Churriana the coins were shuffled to make it difficult for
collectors to obtain a complete set without making purchases.
	   That did not keep them from trying.
	   ``I can't find anyone with a 20-cent piece who's willing to part
with it and it's the only coin I'm missing,'' said collector and
hotelier Isidoro Sanchez, who came half way across the country to
pick up his euros.
	   ``I've heard big collectors are coming in with suitcases, but
I'm just here for myself, I'm not interested in making money
later,'' said Sanchez, 46, who over 12 years has built up a coin
collection weighing 18 kilos (40 pounds).
	   But Sanchez sees lean times ahead.
	   ``The coming of the euro is bad for us collectors as the old
currencies will disappear.'' he said.

Latvians vote on laws that angered Russia, distressed the West

	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ In a referendum on whether to make
citizenship easier for the country's enormous ethnic Russian
community, Latvians on Saturday chose between salving a sense of
injured pride and risking future injury.
	   The referendum, held in conjunction with voting for the
country's 100-seat Saeima parliament, asked voters if they want to
reject liberalizing citizenship law amendments that the parliament
passed in June.
	   The amendments were passed after a tense spring in which Russia
threatened trade sanctions against diminutive neighbor and rained a
hot barrage of denunciations, including Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov's
characterizing Latvia as committing genocide.
	   Meanwhile, the West was unhappy with Latvia, though its
statements were more measured. The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe urged changes and many officials predicted
that the European Union, which Latvia ardently wants to join, would
never let the country in unless it lowered the obstacles to
citizenship.
	   But after the amendments were passed, a referendum drive to
overturn them began, spearheaded by nationalist politicians who
claim Latvian national identity is imperiled.
	   Many Latvians resent Russians, seeing them not only as reminders
of Latvia's suffering during 50 years of Soviet rule, but as
diluting Latvia's sense of itself.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Russians poured into Latvia during the
Soviet years and today the country is little more than half ethnic
Latvian. While almost all Latvians speak passable Russian because
they learned it in Soviet-era schools, many Russians in the country
speak little or no Latvian.
	   The voting took place in clear, cool weather. By midday,
officials said, about 30 percent of the 1.3 eligible voters had
cast their ballots and that some stations had 30-minute waits.
	   However, many voters were confused by the phrasing of the
referendum -- in which a ``yes'' vote means ``no'' to the changes.
	   ``Frankly, I didn't understand the issue or the ballot,'' said
79-yar-old Dzetins Alois, voting in the near-downtown Latgales
neighborhood.
	   Meanwhile, ethnic Russians who could not vote regarded the day
sourly.
	   ``I was born in Riga, I live in Riga, but I am Russian and can't
vote. I don't like it here,'' said a young woman who gave her name
only as Alex, selling cassettes in the vast market that sprawls in
and around five old dirigible hangars on the outskirts of downtown.
	   Of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats in the Saeima
(pronounced SIGH-mah), the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party
of Prime Minister Guntars Krasts was the only major party
campaigning to turn down the changes.
	   On issues other than citizenship, like the need to seek EU and
NATO membership, there is wide agreement among the parties. There
is also broad support for the free-market reforms that have raised
Latvia up from the stagnant Soviet era.
	   Voter support for one party or another seems as much on the
personality of leaders as on specific issues.
	   The party that has been No. 1 in most pre-election polls with
around 20 percent support is the center-right Peoples Party, a new
party founded by wealthy businessman and a former prime minister,
Andris Skele.
	   Skele has said Latvia relies too much on transit trade to and
from Russia, and said policies should also focus on producing goods
in Latvia for export.
	   Other parties scoring around 15 percent in opinion surveys
include the rightist Fatherland and Freedom, the centrist Latvia's
Way and the opposition leftists, the Social Democrats.
	   The centrist News Party, led by flamboyant pop music composer
Raimonds Pauls, is also expected to score above the five percent
threshold required to win parliamentary seats.

Women activists and lawyers protest police violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers, women's activists and
opposition leaders on Saturday protested alleged police violence
and expressed support for jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim.
	   After disappearing for eight days when police arrested arrested
him on Sept. 20, the ousted deputy prime minister appeared in court
Tuesday and Wednesday with a swollen eye and bruises on his neck
and arm. He alleged that police blindfolded, handcuffed and slugged
him.
	   ``We ... would like to add to the chorus of condemnation of
police violence that we are witnessing before our very eyes in our
country today,'' said a statement signed by seven women's groups
including All Women's Action Society, Tenaganita and Women's
Development Collective.
	   ``We are still shocked by the brutal treatment of Anwar Ibrahim
while in detention and the violent treatment of persons who are
arrested in peaceful demonstrations,'' it said.
	   The Malaysian Bar Council also called for the immediate release
of one of Anwar's lawyers and all other dissidents arrested under
the Internal Security Act, which allows for indefinite detention
without trial.
	   ``The Bar Council has always maintained that the ISA is an
oppressive piece of legislation and condemns the use of this
draconian legislation,'' said the council's vice-president, R.R.
Chelvarajah.
	   Days before his arrest, Anwar conducted nation-wide rallies
calling for Mahathir's resignation. Since then, 17 leaders
suspected of organizing the protests have been detained under the
security law. Seven have been freed.
	   Meanwhile, the opposition leader in Parliament, Lim Kit Siang,
called for the Cabinet to press for ``the immediate release'' of
Anwar and his associates.
	   ``There can be no justification for the continued detention of
Anwar under the ISA as he has been charged in court,'' said Lim in
a statement. ``This smacks of political persecution and
victimization.''
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sacked Anwar on Sept. 2 from his
posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister, saying he was
morally unfit for office. The two had clashed over economic policy
as Malaysia sank into recession.
	   During two court appearances this week, Anwar pleaded innocent
to five charges of sodomy and five of corruption.

	   As the majority of the votes nationwide were counted, the
Australian Broadcasting Corp.'s election computer predicted the
Labor Party had failed to oust Howard's conservatives.
	   Kim Beazley led a strong comeback for Labor, which had been
humiliated in the 1996 election by Howard's conservative coalition
of the urban Liberal Party and the rural Nationals, but his
campaign fell short.
	   Labor needed to win at least 27 more seats to gain a majority in
the 148-seat House of Representatives, where government is formed.
	   But the ABC's computers and election analysts predicted Labor
would only win 16 extra seats, not enough to gain government.
	   The detailed ongoing computer tally by the Australian
Broadcasting Corp. predicted a conservative victory by eight seats
-- down from the 41-seat majority it held going into the election.

	   Howard staked his government's fate on what he calls
``economically radical'' tax reforms _ simplifying an antiquated
tax structure that has built up since the 1930s.
	   But this depended on voters' willingness to accept a 10 percent
tax on all goods and services.
	   Howard has tried to soften his tax plan by linking it to income
tax cuts worth Australian dollars 13 billion (U.S. dlrs 7.6
billion) a year and has promised to abolish a variety of other
wholesale taxes.
	   Going into the election, Howard's governing conservatives held
90 seats, Labor 49 and independents eight.
	   Even if Howard retains control in the House of Representatives,
where government is formed, polls have indicated minor parties or
independents again will hold the balance of power in the Senate,
the upper house, meaning the government may have to negotiate to
get bills passed.

<TEXT>
	   SULU, Philippines (AP) _ Soldiers chasing suspected kidnappers
of two Hong Kong residents and a Malaysian killed seven armed men
and wounded several others in a clash in the southern Philippines,
the military said Saturday.
	   There were no government casualties in the battle late Friday in
Talipao town in Sulu province, said an officer involved in the
fight, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The officer said a squad of marines and special forces police
was patrolling a forested area in Talipao when it stumbled on a
group of armed men, touching off the gunbattle.
	   Following the clash, soldiers raided two suspected hideouts of
the abductors in nearby villages but did not find any of the
foreigners.
	   Law Ching-lau and So Ching-ming of Hong Kong and Malaysian Tong
Ket-ming were kidnapped Sept. 8 while they were fishing in the town
of Sitangkai, in nearby Tawi-Tawi island, about 1,050 kilometers
(650 miles) south of Manila.
	   Tong was initially identified as being from Hong Kong but his
local employers showed reporters he carried a Malaysian passport.
	   An Italian priest, the Rev. Luciano Benedetti, was kidnapped
separately in nearby Zamboanga del Norte province on the same day
they were abducted. The following day, another group of kidnappers
took three members of a Taiwanese family in Guiwan, also in
Zamboanga del Norte.
	   All the victims were still with their captors.

U.N. announces new indirect Cyprus talks to break deadlock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The top U.N. official in Cyprus announced
Saturday that she will embark on a series of separate meetings with
the leaders of the war-divided island to try to break the deadlock
in direct reunification talks.
	   The announcement follows reports that Cyprus has agreed to delay
again the controversial deployment of Russian-made missiles.
	   Dame Ann Hercus, the resident representative of the U.N.
secretary-general, said that U.N. resolutions reject the partition
of the island as the basis for a settlement.
	   ``Nevertheless it has to be the role of the impartial mediator
to explore ideas and options,'' she said.
	   Otherwise, ``the parties will continue confronting each other
with their well-entrenched positions,'' she told a news conference.
	   The talks have been deadlocked since August last year following
demands by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash for the recognition
of his breakaway state in the island's Turkish-occupied north.
	   His state is only recognized by Turkey, which invaded Cyprus in
1974 following an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Hercus said Denktash and Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, the
Greek Cypriot leader, agreed to have separate ``confidential
discussions'' with her. The aim is ``to explore how best a process
might evolve or develop and what subjects might be discussed'' in
preparation for a resumption of the direct talks, she added.
	   The new U.N. effort comes amid tension over Clerides' plan for
the deployment of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Turkey has warned it will prevent their deployment. Greece, in
turn, said it would come to the aid of Cyprus if it is attacked.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Clerides has agreed to a further postponement of the arrival of the
missiles, originally planned for July then November.
	   The Cyprus government routinely refuses to comment on the date
of the missiles deployment.

Hong Kong workers face wage freeze
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ More than 100,000 retail workers in Hong Kong
face a wage freeze next year since the economic downturn is not
expected to improve in the next few months, local press reports
said Saturday.
	   The reports said the Hong Kong Retail Management Association has
proposed to its 500 members not to grant wage rises.
	   The assocation's chairman Philip Ma was quoted by the South
China Morning Post as saying that the sluggish economy had taken a
chunk out of business.
	   During the first eight months of this year, the retail sector's
turnover had slumped 15 percent, compared with the same period last
year, Ma was quoted as saying.
	   Ma was not available for comment on Saturday.
	   Earlier, the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce had recommended to
its 4,000 members that they consider freezing or cutting salaries.
	   Five Hong Kong companies have announced cut wages or worker
layoffs this week. Luxury retailer Dickson Concepts said it was
cutting wages averaging 10 percent for its 1,600 workers.
	   The other four companies, including Cathay Pacific Airways, and
filmmaker Golden Harvest, said they were laying off a total of 243
workers.
	   Hong Kong's unemployment rate stands at 5 percent _ relatively
low compared with other countries _ but a 15-year high for the
territory.

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Germany marked its last unification day
holiday with Helmut Kohl as chancellor Saturday by honoring him for
his crowning achievement in office: reunifying Germany.
	   Defeated last week in his bid for an unprecedented fifth term,
Kohl sat in the front row during the official ceremony at the
Hanover congress center, but did not speak.
	   In a statement issued earlier, he praised all that Germany had
accomplished in bringing east and west together since 1990's
unification.
	   ``What we've attained with each other in the past eight years is
unprecedented in history,'' he said.
	   Others singled Kohl out, though, for leading the effort to bring
divided Germany together while reassuring worried neighbors like
France and Poland that a reunited Germany would remain peaceful.
	   ``I think this is a good moment to remind people about that,''
chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder said, expressing his ``respect''
for Kohl. ``And I'm sure the people in Germany won't forget it.''
	   Schroeder, who led the Social Democrats' defeat of Kohl last
week, played host to the national celebrations in his role as
president of parliament's upper house.
	   His words brought sustained applause from the hundreds of
invited guests. ``Kohl lost the election, but that doesn't change
what he's done for Germany,'' one guest, Peter Imhoff, a state
official in Hesse, said afterward.
	   Czech President Vaclav Havel, the guest of honor, said German
unification ``was good for the whole world'' because it meant the
end of an ``evil''' system of communism.
	   But Schroeder noted the economic and social upheaval that
followed the demise of East Germany has given rise to another
danger: growing support for neo-Nazi ideas, especially among
disoriented youth.
	   Germany can be proud that no far-right party came close to
winning parliamentary seats in last week's election, he said.
	   ``But that shouldn't lead us to lose sight of the causes'' that
lead young people above all to vote for such parties, he said.
	   ``Radicalism always feeds itself on the fears and insecurities
in times of dramatic change'' _ not just unification, but the
tougher competition brought about by globalization.
	   Schroeder, who was expected to be sworn in as chancellor at the
end of the month, called for more attention to history and to more
job and training opportunities for young people.
	   The ceremony was preceded by a political fight over an original
musical work mixing portions of the German national anthem and the
one used in communist East Germany.
	   Conservatives accused Schroeder, whose state government
commissioned the piece, of desecrating the national anthem and
insulting the victims of East Germany's totalitarian regime.
Bavarian leaders boycotted the ceremony.
	   But even Kohl clapped politely when the composition including
the anthem was played. And German President Roman Herzog dismissed
the fuss as overblown.
	   ``Our state can endure that, and it's symbols, when we value
them enough,'' he said.
	   The people of former East Germany will be remembered not by
their old anthem, he said, but by the chant heard during the
candlelight marches that eventually brought down the communist
leaders: ``We are the people.''
	   The audience applauded in response.

Pay more attention to 1973 war, Mubarak tells art community
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak criticized the Arab
world's artists and intellectuals Saturday for not creating works
that would immortalize Egypt's 1973 war against Israel.
	   ``This great page in Egypt's history has not received ... its
due from Egyptian intellectuals and artists,'' Mubarak said in a
speech aired on Egyptian Television.
	   ``We were and are still waiting from Egyptian and Arab artists
to participate in the immortalization of this critical time in
books, researches, paintings, and works of drama fitting to the
majesty of the occasion,'' Mubarak said.
	   Mubarak was speaking at the opening ceremony of a three-day
seminar marking the 25th anniversary of the war, when Egyptian
forces crossed the Suez Canal into the Israeli-occupied Sinai
Peninsula. Israel captured the peninsula in 1967.
	   Israel later pushed back the Egyptians, but Arabs hailed the
crossing as a victory that mitigated the shame of the 1967 defeat.

Report: Chrysler CEO to step down earlier than announced
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Chrysler chief executive Robert Eaton
may retire from the soon-to-be created DaimlerChrysler earlier than
agreed, a news magazine reported Saturday.
	   Under terms of the merger, Eaton is to stay on for three years
as co-chief executive with Daimler chief Juergen Schrempp.
	   But Eaton was quoted by the newsweekly Spiegel as saying that he
would have ``no problem'' turning the merged company over to
Schrempp as soon as it became clear that the companies had
successfully integrated operations.
	   ``In the long-term, there can be only one boss,'' Spiegel quoted
Eaton as saying.
	   The merger of the German industrial giant Daimler-Benz with
Chrysler was expected to be complete by November, creating the
world's third-largest automaker.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard's
conservative government won re-election Saturday and claimed a
mandate to reform Australia's tax system, despite a diminished
majority in Parliament, the national broadcaster said. The
Australian Broadcasting Corp.'s election computer predicted the
Labor Party had failed to oust Howard's conservatives. Kim Beazley
led a strong comeback for Labor, which had been humiliated in the
1996 election by Howard's conservative coalition of the urban
Liberal Party and the rural Nationals, but his campaign fell short.
Labor needed to win at least 27 more seats to gain a majority in
the 148-seat House of Representatives, where government is formed.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has recalled its diplomats from
Pakistan because of fears for their safety, Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi said Saturday. The move was the latest
deterioration in relations between the two neighbors, who have
competed for influence in Afghanistan. ``There have been many
assassinations in Pakistan in the past few months and a number of
Iranians serving in Pakistan have been killed,'' Kharrazi told the
official state-run Tehran radio upon his return from a session at
the United Nations in New York. Kharrazi said the 60 diplomats
recalled from various missions in Pakistan on Thursday would return
as soon as security improved. (IRAN-PAKISTAN)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday
there were no plans to ban the circulation of dollars in Russia,
but the government would take steps to curb the outflow of the U.S.
currency. Meeting with Western businessmen, Primakov also said that
the privatization of Russian enterprises would continue. Responding
to media reports of a government economic plan that would prohibit
Russians from buying U.S. dollars and other foreign currency,
Primakov said the reports ``absolutely do not correspond to
reality,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted him as saying. He said
there was no need to regulate the influx of dollars into Russia,
but the government should take steps to prevent what he called
``the dollar drain.'' (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In advance of a visit next week by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Palestinians on
Saturday urged Israel to avoid ``delaying tricks'' they said have
so far obstructed a new accord. Meanwhile, a small-scale clash
broke out Saturday in the divided West Bank town of Hebron, where
Israeli soldiers fired rubber bullets at a small group of
stone-throwers. It has been a tense week in Hebron, which is home
to 450 Jewish settlers and 130,000 Palestinians and a frequent
flashpoint for violence. Albright is scheduled to arrive in the
Middle East on Tuesday for two days of talks to prepare for a
summit meeting in Washington on Oct. 15-19. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers, women's activists and
opposition leaders on Saturday protested alleged police violence in
Malaysia and expressed support for jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim.
After disappearing for eight days when police arrested arrested him
on Sept. 20, the ousted deputy prime minister appeared in court
Tuesday and Wednesday with a swollen eye and bruises on his neck
and arm. He alleged that police blindfolded, handcuffed and slugged
him. ``We ... would like to add to the chorus of condemnation of
police violence that we are witnessing before our very eyes in our
country today,'' said a statement signed by seven women's groups
including All Women's Action Society, Tenaganita and Women's
Development Collective. (MALAYSIA-ANWAR PROTEST)

Australia strongly placed in first Test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) _ Australia was building a substantial
first innings lead over Pakistan, reaching 352 for four at lunch on
the third day of the first cricket Test Saturday.
	   Overnight batsmen Steve Waugh and Darren Lehmann cut at the
outset after Australia resumed at the overnight total of 237 for
four in reply to Pakistan's first innings total of 269.
	   Lehmann was unbeaten on 61 with the help of nine fours while
Steve Waugh looked solid on 157.
	   Lehmann survived a close call in leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed's
second over of the day when English umpire Peter Willey turned down
a vociferous bat and pad appeal. However, the TV replays showed
that the ball had brushed the gloves of the left-hander after
hitting the front pad.
	   Lehmann fully profited from the chance and was especially harsh
on left-arm spinner Mohammad Hussain with some exquisite
strokeplay. He cut Hussain for two successive boundaries which
brought up his half century in only 68 balls.
	   Pakistan captain Aamir Sohail, who took a new ball after 93
overs, used all his six bowlers, but couldn't find the
breakthrough. The Australians have a lead of 83 runs with six
wickets still in hand.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard's
conservative government won re-election Saturday and claimed a
mandate to reform the nation's tax system despite a diminished grip
on Parliament, national media reported.
	   With more than two-thirds of the vote counted, computer analysis
by the Australian Broadcasting Corp. showed the main opposition
Labor Party had won a big haul of votes away from the government,
but not enough to deliver them a majority in Parliament's House of
Representatives.
	   The conservatives held off a strong challenge from the far
right-wing One Nation party, which attracted about 8 percent of the
national vote.
	   One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, who exploded onto the
political scene about 18 months ago with proposals to freeze Asian
immigration and cut welfare programs for Aborigines, appeared not
to have been re-elected, calling into question the party's ability
to continue.
	   About 12 million registered voters cast their ballots at
thousands of polling booths in public buildings, from the nation's
desert Outback to its tropical north and in its modern, bustling
cities in the southeast.
	   Howard could take only limited comfort from the victory, with
voters deserting his governing coalition in droves to opposition
parties which may yet have the power to alter his tax plan.
	   In the outgoing parliament, Howard's governing conservatives
held 90 seats, Labor 49 and independents eight. A final official
outcome in all electorates may not be known for days, but the ABC
computer was predicting a conservative victory by eight seats _
down from the 41-seat majority it held going into the election.
	   Michael Parkin, a 30-year-old employee of Telstra Corp., said he
voted Labor as a protest against the Howard's sell-off of one third
of the partly government-owned telecommunications giant.
	   ``I voted Labor because of my job. Howard has just about sold
everything out from under me,'' Parkin said.
	   Howard staked his government's fate on what he calls
``economically radical'' tax reforms _ simplifying an antiquated
tax structure that has built up since the 1930s.
	   The centerpiece of the plan is a 10 percent tax on all goods and
services, which voters rejected outright at an election in 1993.
	   Labor Party leader Kim Beazley, promised something far less
painful: creation of 500,000 jobs. And he used a ``no tax'' promise
to pull Labor close to victory.
	   Labor was thrown out in a landslide victory for Howard in 1996.
	   With the historical odds against him, Beazley led Labor to a
strong recovery, probably capturing 16 of the 27 seats the party
needed for outright victory, the ABC reported., using vote counts
provided by the official Australian Election Commission.
	   The corporation feeds results into the computer as they are
counted officially, giving an almost real-time result on an
electorate-by-electorate basis.
	   The domestic news service Australian Associated Press also
predicted a conservative victory, but with a much diminished
majority.
	   Labor needed to hold all its current electorates and win 27 more
to seize a majority in the House of Representatives, the more
powerful chamber in Australia's bicameral Parliament.
	   Labor and the coalition had been in a dead heat for weeks,
according to the polls.
	   Casting his vote in his west coast electorate, Beazley predicted
before counting began that there would be a clear result by late
Saturday night. He was cautiously hopeful.
	   ``We've been there for over a century trying our very best to
represent the views of ordinary Australians. Sometimes we've
succeeded in winning their trust, sometimes we've not,'' Beazley
told reporters.
	   Voting in his Sydney electorate, Howard said he was nervous
about the outcome.
	   ``When you get to this stage you just wait and see what the
result is. I am hopeful but it will be tight. I think I confess to
a few first night nerves,'' Howard said.
	   Even if Howard retains control in the House of Representatives,
where government is formed, polls have indicated minor parties or
independents again will hold the balance of power in the upper
house, meaning the government may have to negotiate to get bills
passed.
	   The ABC computer showed Senate voting trends in favor of
minority party the Democrats, which looked likely to hold the
balance of power.
	   Howard tried to soften his tax plan by linking it to income tax
cuts worth Australian dollars 13 billion (U.S. dlrs 7.6 billion) a
year and has promised to abolish a variety of other wholesale
taxes. But the income tax cuts are based on the uncertain
assumption that the Australian economy will continue to grow 3.5
percent a year to keep the federal budget in surplus.
	   Beazley promised to create a half-million jobs in three years
and called for income tax cuts targeting low-income earners. His
proposed cuts would have cost Australian dollars 3 billion (U.S.
dlrs 1.8 billion), an amount he said would be affordable even under
the International Monetary Fund's more modest growth projections.

Italian Communist wants to yank support from Prodi coalition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QL; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's Communist leader on Saturday called on his
followers to yank support for Premier Romano Prodi's coalition,
which could bring down the government.
	   Deputy Premier Walter Veltroni said that the government was
prepared to turn to Parliament for a vote on whether it still had a
majority backing.
	   ``It's nothing new. It's what we were expecting,'' Veltroni
said, when asked about Fausto Bertinotti's proposal to yank
support.
	   Bertinotti's call to other top leaders of his Communist
Refoundation Party also risks splitting the hardliners. The party's
No. 2, Armando Cossutta, immediately appealed for the party's
continued support of the nearly 2 1-2 year old center-left
government.
	   Refoundation's committee of officials was meeting Saturday and
Sunday in Rome to decide whether to keep backing the government.
	   The duel centers over how the Communists, who give Prodi a
majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies, should express their
unhappiness over the government's proposed 1999 budget.
	   ``I appeal to comrades ... to leave a crack open. Let's not
close the political prospectives (but) stay inside the majority to
fight'' for another budget, said Cossutta, party president.
	   But Bertinotti, as party secretary the Communists' No. 1
official, urged Refoundation's political committee to ``give the
mandate to party members of Parliament to vote against this budget
and to withdraw support for the Prodi government.''
	   Refoundation is not part of the government itself but works
closely with the majority to back legislation.
	   The Communists contend the budget doesn't contain enough funds
to stimulate job creation to fight unemployment, which runs as high
as 20 percent in the south, or sufficient backing for social
assistance programs for the poor.
	   The opposition center-right, led by former Premier Silvio
Berlusconi and sensing that voters would be angry over a collapse
by the government they put into office in May 1996, has been
calling for early elections.
	   If the Communists do yank support, and centrists outside the
coalition fail to come to his rescue, Prodi, who insists he is
sticking to the budget, would be forced to resign.
	   The budget, designed to keep Italy in line with the requirements
for the common European currency, calls for dlrs 8 billion (13.5
trillion lire) in deficit-cutting measures.

Opposition marks anniversary of White House storming

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Opposition demonstrators marched through Moscow
Saturday to mark the fifth anniversary of the bloody clash between
government forces and opposition lawmakers in the Russian capital.
	   About 1,000 people, waving Soviet-era flags and anti-government
banners, marched from the Lenin monument on Kaluzhskaya Square
along the same route to the Russian White House that protesters
took five years ago, Russian television reported.
	   The marchers carried signs demanding the resignation of
President Boris Yeltsin and the replacement of the current
government by socialism.
	   A separate group of several hundred earlier held a rally at the
Ostankino television broadcasting center, where dozens of people
died in clashes with Interior Ministry troops.
	   The events of Oct. 3-4, 1993, were set off when Yeltsin decided
to dissolve the conservative, Soviet-era parliament.
	   Hard-line lawmakers refused to disband and barricaded themselves
inside the White House. The standoff erupted into violence when an
angry mob of supporters broke through police lines into the
building and armed hard-liners later attempted to storm the
Ostankino television broadcasting center.
	   The next day, Yeltsin called in troops and tanks that shelled
parliament and forced his foes to surrender.
	   An estimated 200 people died in the violence.
	   About 350 demonstrators, organized by Communist Party chief
Gennady Zyuganov, gathered Saturday morning at the television
center to pay tribute to those who died.
	   Anatoly Kryuchkov, an organizer of the march to the White House,
the government headquarters that then housed parliament, said
Zyuganov's morning rally had probably caused attendance at his
demonstration to dwindle.
	   ``It would have been better in the evening when the shooting
took place at Ostankino,'' he told reporters.
	   Kryuchkov, who heads the hard-line Russian Communist Workers
Party, said the party led by Zyuganov and the trade unions had
become opportunists. ``They are a political lightening conductor
wasting the energies of the works,'' he said.
	   He said a national day of protest on Oct. 7, organized by the
Communists and trade unionists, will amount to nothing but ``air
shaking.''
	   Kryuchkov said demonstrators should act decisively ``and picket
the buildings of official structures and stay there until the chief
officials have resigned.''

Fairly strong earthquake strikes in East China Sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A fairly strong earthquake with a preliminary
magnitude of 6.0 struck the East China Sea off Okinawa on Saturday,
but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
	   The quake was centered about 200 kilometers (124 miles) under
the ocean floor about 1,385 kilometers (859 miles), southwest of
Tokyo, the Meteorological Agency said.
	   There was no danger of tsunami, seismic waves caused by undersea
disturbances such as earthquakes, as a result of the temblor, which
occurred at 8:16 p.m. (1116 GMT), the agency said.
	   Several towns on Okinawa _ Japan's southernmost island _ were
moderately felt by the earthquake, the agency said.
	   A magnitude 6-level quake can cause widespread damage if it
occurs in a residential area.

More wheat arrives for flood victims in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A ship carrying 21,000 tons of wheat
arrived in Bangladesh on Saturday to help millions of flood victims
in this impoverished nation, officials said.
	   The second shipment since last month was arranged by the United
Nations World Food Program, a WFP press statement said.
	   Bangladesh was ravaged in July and August by the worst floods in
decades, leading to massive food shortages. The government asked
for nearly 900 dlrs in international aid.
	   The United States has promised 700,000 tons of wheat and rice.
	   A third shipment is expected next week that would raise the WFP
supply to 52,000 tons of wheat. The U.N. body will provide a total
of 355,000 tons of wheat by year-end.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A special anti-terrorist court on
Saturday sentenced seven militant Sunni Muslim activists to death
for killing two Iranian engineers in the southern port city of
Karachi earlier this year.
	   Only two convicts were present in court. The other five still
were at large.
	   The militants belonged to the Sunni Muslim group,
Sipah-e-Sahaba, or the Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet. The
group is locked in a bloody feud with extremist Shiite Muslim
organizations.
	   In February, the men shot and killed two Iranian engineers
working on a bridge in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city of 14
million people.
	   Unidentified gunmen, also believed to be members of the
Sipah-e-Sahaba shot an killed the state prosecutor in the case,
Sardar Khan.
	   Sunni militants blame Iran for supporting extremist Shiite
organizations, while Shiite Muslim activists accuse Saudi Arabia
for helping Sunni groups. Both the countries deny the charge.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed as religious violence has
escalated all over Pakistan in recent years.
	   Shiite Muslims are a minority of 15 percent in Sunni-dominated
Pakistan.

`Joe' Ozaki leads by three strokes in Japan Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HIGASHI-IBARAKI, Japan (AP) _ First-round co-leader Naomichi
``Joe'' Ozaki fired a 4-under-par 68 Saturday to grab a sole,
three-stroke lead after 54 holes in the Japan Open.
	   Joe Ozaki, the youngest of three Ozaki brothers on the Japan PGA
Tour, scored an eagle and four birdies against two bogeys for a
5-under 211 total. He had started the round one stroke off the
pace.
	   ``I'm glad I'm in a good position to contend for the big
title,'' said the 42-year-old Joe Ozaki, in contention for his
first victory of the season and 26th overall. ``But I don't
consider the margin big enough for an easy victory.''
	   The top money winner of the 1991 season has played mostly on the
U.S. PGA Tour since 1993, competing only in a limited number of
tournaments in Japan. He has yet to win in the United States.
	   Joe Ozaki has gained a permanent exempt status on the Japan tour
by winning his 25th victory last year in the Yonex Open Hiroshima.
	   Overnight co-leader Hidemichi Tanaka had three birdies and three
bogeys en route to a 72 and fell to a tie for second at 214 with
Toru Taniguchi and Hiroyuki Fujita, who both shot an identical 70
with four birdies and two bogeys each.
	   Australian Peter McWhinney fired a 69 for 216 to share fifth
with Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki and Toshimitsu Izawa, the other
co-leader overnight. Jumbo Ozaki, a five-time Japan Open winner,
turned in a 72 and Izawa a 73.
	   Jumbo, the eldest of the Ozaki brothers, is currently leading
the money list so far with two victories this season.
	   Defending champion Craig Parry of Australia carded a 74 for a
share of 12th at 218.
	   The 120 million yen (dlrs 882,000) Japan Open, the third of
Japan's four major tournaments, offers a top prize of 24 million
yen (dlrs 176,000).

	   TASOVCICI, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ One Muslim returnee was
killed and three others injured when in a series of explosions
outside of Muslim homes in a southern Bosnian village,
international officials said Saturday.
	   The first explosion occurred late Friday, when an unidentified
attacker threw a handgrenade out of a passing car, said Kelly
Moore, spokeswoman for the United Nations in Bosnia. The grenade
rolled under a car parked in front of a Muslim-owned house and
exploded.
	   A group of seven Muslims and one Croat were standing in front of
the house, one was killed and three others injured, including
60-year-old Sakir Kudra.
	   ``Had (the bomb) not rolled under the car, more of us would be
dead,'' said Kudra.
	   The victim was identified as Adem Muminagic, 60.
	   Moore said four other attacks on Muslim houses in the village of
Tasovcici, 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Sarajevo, also
occurred late Friday and early Saturday. Noone was injured in these
attacks.
	   Chris Riley, a spokesman for Bosnian's top international
official, Carlos Westendorp, said his office ``strongly condemns
the violence'' and holds the local police and political leadership
responsible for the security of all citizens.
	   Some Muslims had returned two days ago to their homes Tasovcici,
in the Croat-dominated region of the Muslim-Croat Federation, under
an agreement between local officials.
	   Under the 1995 Dayton Peace agreement, Bosnia is divided into
the Serb republic and the joint Muslim-Croat federation. Clashes
between the Muslims and the Croats have plagued the federation
since its founding.
	   Incidents have increased in the region since Muslim refugees
began returning to the homes they were forced to flee during
fighting between Muslims and Croats in 1993.
	   According to Himzo Saric, representative of the Muslims in
Tasovcici, the latest incidents will not prevent the some 80 Muslim
families from returning to their homes in the sensitive region.
	   Also Saturday, the head of the United Nations mission in Bosnia
Elisabeth Rehn went to Mostar Saturday to meet with local leaders
and international officials to discuss the region's security
situation.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard's
conservative government won re-election Saturday and claimed a
mandate to reform the nation's tax system despite a diminished grip
on Parliament, national media reported.
	   With more than two-thirds of the vote counted, computer analysis
by the Australian Broadcasting Corp. showed the main opposition
Labor Party had won a big haul of votes away from the government,
but not enough to deliver them a majority in Parliament's House of
Representatives.
	   The conservatives held off a strong challenge from the far
right-wing One Nation party, which attracted about 8 percent of the
national vote.
	   One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, who exploded onto the
political scene about 18 months ago with proposals to freeze Asian
immigration and cut welfare programs for Aborigines, appeared not
to have been re-elected, calling into question the party's ability
to continue.
	   About 12 million registered voters cast their ballots at
thousands of polling booths in public buildings, from the nation's
desert Outback to its tropical north and in its modern, bustling
cities in the southeast.
	   Howard could take only limited comfort from the victory, with
voters deserting his governing coalition in droves to opposition
parties which may yet have the power to alter his tax plan.
	   In the outgoing parliament, Howard's governing conservatives
held 90 seats, Labor 49 and independents eight. A final official
outcome in all electorates may not be known for days, but the ABC
computer was predicting a conservative victory by eight seats _
down from the 41-seat majority it held going into the election.
	   Labor leader Kim Beazley appeared before cheering supporters in
Perth to say, ``I think a win by us is unlikely.''
	   But he was in a jovial mood over the gains Labor made in
Parliament, despite falling short of gaining government. The
jubilation of the crowd made it sound more like a victory party
than a concession speech.
	   Michael Parkin, a 30-year-old employee of Telstra Corp., said he
voted Labor as a protest against Howard's sell-off of one-third of
the partly government-owned telecommunications giant.
	   ``I voted Labor because of my job. Howard has just about sold
everything out from under me,'' Parkin said.
	   Howard staked his government's fate on what he calls
``economically radical'' tax reforms _ simplifying an antiquated
tax structure that has built up since the 1930s.
	   The centerpiece of the plan is a 10 percent tax on all goods and
services, which voters rejected outright at an election in 1993.
	   Beazley promised something far less painful: creation of 500,000
jobs. And he used a ``no tax'' promise to pull Labor close to
victory.
	   Labor was thrown out in a landslide victory for Howard in 1996.
	   With the historical odds against him, Beazley led Labor to a
strong recovery, probably capturing 16 of the 27 seats the party
needed for outright victory, the ABC reported., using vote counts
provided by the official Australian Election Commission.
	   The corporation feeds results into the computer as they are
counted officially, giving an almost real-time result on an
electorate-by-electorate basis.
	   The domestic news service Australian Associated Press also
predicted a conservative victory, but with a much diminished
majority.
	   Labor needed to hold all its current electorates and win 27 more
to seize a majority in the House of Representatives, the more
powerful chamber in Australia's bicameral Parliament.
	   Labor and the coalition had been in a dead heat for weeks,
according to the polls.
	   Casting his vote in his west coast electorate, Beazley predicted
before counting began that there would be a clear result by late
Saturday night. He was cautiously hopeful.
	   ``We've been there for over a century trying our very best to
represent the views of ordinary Australians. Sometimes we've
succeeded in winning their trust, sometimes we've not,'' Beazley
told reporters during the vote.
	   Voting in his Sydney electorate, Howard said he was nervous
about the outcome.
	   ``When you get to this stage you just wait and see what the
result is. I am hopeful but it will be tight. I think I confess to
a few first night nerves,'' Howard said.
	   Even if Howard retains control in the House of Representatives,
where government is formed, polls have indicated minor parties or
independents again will hold the balance of power in the upper
house, meaning the government may have to negotiate to get bills
passed.
	   The ABC computer showed Senate voting trends in favor of
minority party the Democrats, which looked likely to hold the
balance of power.
	   Howard tried to soften his tax plan by linking it to income tax
cuts worth Australian dollars 13 billion (U.S. dlrs 7.6 billion) a
year and has promised to abolish a variety of other wholesale
taxes. But the income tax cuts are based on the uncertain
assumption that the Australian economy will continue to grow 3.5
percent a year to keep the federal budget in surplus.
	   Beazley promised to create a half-million jobs in three years
and called for income tax cuts targeting low-income earners. His
proposed cuts would have cost Australian dollars 3 billion (U.S.
dlrs 1.8 billion), an amount he said would be affordable even under
the International Monetary Fund's more modest growth projections.

Belgian technical assistance team in Burundi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Three years after Belgium and other
western nations suspended their technical assistance to Burundi
because of political and ethnic violence, a Belgian team has
returned to discuss resumption of projects, sources at the Foreign
Ministry said Saturday.
	   The four-member team is led by Philippe Jalet, deputy director
of Belgian technical assistance.
	   In August, Reginald Moreels, Belgian secretary of state for
development assistance and Burundi Foreign Minister Severin
Ntahomvukiye indicated that the aid programs would resume shortly.
	   President Pierre Buyoya, who says he led a July 1996 coup to
staunch the violence that erupted after the October 1993
assassination by army paratroopers of the Burundi's first
democratically elected president, told the U.N. General Assembly
last month that regional sanctions imposed on Burundi should be
lifted.
	   Buyoya says Burundi has met the basic demands of its neighbors,
including support for democratic institutions and talks between the
Tutsi-dominated government and Hutu rebels, required before
sanctions can be lifted.
	   All-party peace talks began in June under the auspices of former
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere and are expected to resume later
this month.
	   At least 200,000 people have perished since 1993 in the
violence, most of them Tutsi and Hutu civilians caught between the
Tutsi army and the Hutu rebels.
	   Although Tutsis make up only 14 percent of Burundi's 6 million
people _ Hutus account for 85 percent _ they have run the tiny
central African country for all but four months since independence
from Belgium in July 1962.

 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Right-wing populist leader Pauline
Hanson made the bold prediction early Saturday that she would lead
up to 15 members of her One Nation party into Parliament with the
cry: ``I'm back.''
	   But after most votes in the nation's national election were
counted, it was apparent Hanson would not be leading any new
members into the new Parliament and was unlikely to be returning
herself.
	   Hanson, elected to Parliament as an independent at an election
in 1996, has dominated Australian politics since her inaugural
speech later that year. In it she warned that Australia was in
danger of being ``swamped by Asians'' and opposed land rights and
special welfare benefits for Aborigines.
	   She broadened her appeal by including policies of economic
protectionism that would help small business owners and farmers.
	   After launching One Nation in April 1997, Hanson attracted 23
percent of the vote and 11 seats in the Parliament in an election
in Queensland state in June this year.
	   After that result, One Nation appeared a real chance to capture
the balance of power in the upper house of federal Parliament, the
Senate, at the next election.
	   But voters in Saturday's national election appeared to have put
paid to that by voting strongly for for the minority party the
Democrats in the Senate, and by ousting Hanson herself in her
Queensland electorate, according the official voting figures.
	   With more than 80 percent of the vote counted in Hanson's
district of Blair, she received just less than 47 percent of the
vote, against government Liberal Party candidate Cameron Thompson
with more than 53 percent.
	   Hanson refused to concede defeat and vowed that One Nation would
continue even without her in Parliament.
	   ``I'm very disappointed,'' Hanson told reporters. ``(But) One
Nation will go on. I believe there is a lot of support for One
Nation. We're not going away anywhere.''
	   Shortly afterwards, Hanson closed her election night function to
news crews.
	   Earlier Saturday, when casting her vote Hanson conceded she was
fighting for her political life. However, she said she expected to
re-enter Parliament on what would be the greatest day of her life.
	   She forecast One Nation would capture up to six Senate seats and
between 12 and 15 in the lower house.
	   With 80 percent of the vote counted, Hanson was the closest of
all One Nation candidates to winning a seat in the lower house.
	   The outcome in the Senate, where the voting system is different
that the lower chamber House of Representatives, will probably not
be known for days.
	   Late Saturday, One Nation candidates were still a chance to win
two Senate seats, but the strong vote for the Democrats was likely
to give that party the balance of power, analysts said.
	   The government formed in the lower house is beholden to the
party holding the balance of power in the Senate for passing the
majority of bills.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer said his rural-based National
Party, junior to the Liberal Party in the ruling coalition, and the
party most hurt by One Nation, had fended off one of the greatest
threats to it.
	   ``What is clear tonight is that the anti-trade, racist element
of One Nation has been rejected the Australian people,'' an
exultant Fischer told reporters.
	   ``The (coalition) has stood up and repulsed a full frontal
assault by One Nation. We have learned a great deal in the process.
	   ``This is one of the finest hours of the National Party.''

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mongolian president appealing for calm, picks up
4th graf pvs, `the killing ...'
 &UR; By MICHAEL KOHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) _ President N. Bagabandi urged the
public to stay calm Saturday following the assassination of a
prominent member of Mongolia's democratic movement.
	   ``I challenge everyone to be disciplined about this serious
crime that has shocked our society. I urge you not to get involved
in any kind of sensationalist stories,'' Bagabandi said in a public
address expressing condolences to the family of the slain
politician.
	   Sanjaasuregiin Zorig, minister for infrastructure in the ruling
Democratic Coalition, was axed and stabbed to death at his home by
two masked assailants at about 10:30 p.m. Friday.
	   Bagabandi said he was confident that the attackers, who remained
at large, would be brought to justice.
	   The killing, believed to be politically motivated, could further
complicate efforts to break a deadlock in Mongolian politics that
has persisted since Prime Minister Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj resigned
on July 24 along with his entire cabinet.
	   Zorig, a popular figure who played a leading role in the 1990
democratic revolution that ended seven decades of Stalinist rule,
had been widely expected to be named next week as a possible
successor to Elbegdorj.
	   The coalition has considered and failed to agree on four earlier
candidates. Zorig, a 36-year-old Moscow-educated former social
sciences professor and a member of parliament since 1990, would
have become the fifth nominee.
	   The crisis was precipitated when the three-month-old coalition
government lost a vote of confidence following a feud over whether
to merge a state bank with a private bank.
	   The opposition Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the
former communists, accused the government of organizing the merger
in a way that financially benefited its members and protested by
boycotting the Great Hural, Mongolia's parliament, throwing
proceedings into turmoil.
	   The coalition government had 30 days to reorganize itself and
nominate a new prime minister, but has failed to do so.
	   The political impasse has prevented work on crucial economic
legislation.
	   Mongolia, a landlocked Central Asian nation flanked by Russia
and China, used to be dependent on subsidies from Moscow and has
seen its economy weaken precipitously since the breakup of the
Soviet Union in 1991.
	   The vast, sparsely populated land was once the heart of the
largest empire the Earth ever knew. But according to World Bank
estimates, 36 percent of its 2 million people now live in poverty.
Inflation topped 30 percent last year and unemployment is high.
Forty percent of the population are nomadic herders.
	   Peaceful protests in 1990 forced the pro-Soviet People's
Revolutionary Party to drop communism and allow free and fair
multiparty elections. Its 75-year rule ended with a 1996
parliamentary election that swept the reformist Democratic Union
into office and won accolades for the nation's progress toward
democracy.

Thai police investigating the death of eight elephants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Authorities are investigating the
sudden deaths of eight elephants and illness of three others in an
area in northern Thailand popular with tourists, a conservationist
said Saturday.
	   Local villagers suspect the deaths of at least two of the
elephants resulted from a dispute between rival groups of ethnic
Karen elephant trainers fighting to attract tourists to their
trekking services, said Saengduen Chailert, director of the
Elephant Nature Park, a conservation center in Chiang Mai province.
	   Six other elephants have fallen ill and died unexpectedly in the
past month in Chiang Mai's Mae Taeng district, said Saengduen. Two
others that died last Wednesday were believed to have been poisoned
since their mouth were full of vomit, she said.
	   All of the elephants had been used for jungle trek tours, she
said.
	   Regardless of the cause of the elephants' deaths, their demise
has important consequences for the villagers, whose traditional
beliefs have caused them to decide to relocate their village, along
with their 43 living elephants.
	   ``The Karens believe that if they come in contact with the site
where the elephants had died they could be cursed,'' Saengduen
said.
	   A further complication, said Saengduen, is that one of the dead
elephants was found in a nearby pond.
	   ``For them, an elephant dying in water is even more serious,''
she said.
	   She said it was not clear what caused the deaths of all the
elephants and criticized the authorities for being slow in their
investigation and not being sensitive to the needs and beliefs of
the local Karen hill-tribe people.
	   About 300 to 500 tourists visit the area daily depending on the
season. The elephant deaths could hurt the tourist industry,
Saengduan said.

Cypriot officials criticize West for doing little on Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMASSOL, Cyprus (AP) _ Cypriot officials criticized Saturday
the United Nations, the United States and the European Union for
tolerating human rights abuses in the Turkish-occupied north.
	   ``I feel very sad in stressing that the United Nations
secretariat has done nothing to alleviate the human suffering
resulting from Turkey's trampling of the human rights of the Greek
Cypriot population,'' said Spyros Kyprianou, the speaker of the
Greek Cypriot parliament, who opened the one-day meeting.
	   He blamed, too, the United States and the European Union.
	   The event drew other Cypriot officials and European jurists.
	   Cyprus has been unofficially partitioned since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Talks on reunification are deadlocked.

Serbs move to evade NATO intervention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with naming of interim Council, Albanian reactions,
attack on a Serb vehicle. Trims.
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serb-appointed interim council for
Kosovo announced Saturday it would work to ``normalize conditions''
in the province, where Serbian authorities are eager to show world
leaders their interest in a peaceful solution to the bloody
conflict.
	   The Serbs are anxious to avoid NATO airstrikes and are making
last ditch efforts to show their progress towards ending the
conflict. But ethnic Albanian political leaders have rejected the
council as a ``body formed by Serbian authorities,'' not a body
that would be part of Kosovo self-rule.
	   The body, appointed by the Serbian parliament last week,
includes a Serb prime minister and an 17 other governing members,
comprised of both Serbs and ethnic Albanians and is envisaged as an
interim government to deal with local issues in Kosovo.
	   ``Our task is to normalize conditions as soon as possible and
create conditions for local elections in Kosovo,'' said Zoran
Andjelkovic. ``I hope we will not last for a very long time,
because that means we will be successful.''
	   Edita Tahiri, a top ethnic Albanan political leader, condemned
the setting up of the council as ``strengthening Serbian rule in
Kosovo.''
	   ``The act ... is a serious impediment for any success in a
negotiating process,'' she said.
	   On Friday, ethnic Albanian political leaders also rebuffed a
Serb offer to hold talks, saying they won't sit down with them
until NATO intervenes.Low-grade talks between the two sides, which
the Serbs say could lead to restoring some of the autonomy they
took away from Kosovo in 1989, broke off last May.
	   The Serbs' Media Center reported Saturday that a Yugoslav army
vehicle came under attack some 20 kilometers (12 miles) southwest
of Pristina late Friday. Nobody was injured.
	   Besides asking the ethnic Albanian negotiating team to resume a
political dialogue, the Serbs invited U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to visit Kosovo, removed a key police roadblock and showed
reporters heavy equipment they said has been withdrawn.
	   But Annan, who is to deliver a report Monday on whether
Milosevic has complied, turned down the offer. And the United
States warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that NATO will
strike Serb forces within two weeks unless he meets all U.N.
demands in halting his assault on ethnic Albanians.
	   ``We cannot allow this conflict to spread again and risk what we
stopped in Bosnia starting over again in Kosovo,'' U.S. President
Bill Clinton said.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, however, argued the
problems in Kosovo cannot be solved by the use of outside force.
And Russia's parliament declared that any action taken without U.N.
approval would be considered an ``illegal act of aggression.''
	   The international furor over the Serbs' eight-month war in
Kosovo has intensified this week, pushing the United States and
other countries to the verge of long-threatened airstrikes.
	   The Serbs' efforts to crush separatist resistance in the
province, which is populated largely by ethnic Albanians, has
killed hundreds of people and driven an estimated 275,000 from
their homes.
	   Even as the Serbs said this week that they were halting their
action against Kosovo ``terrorists,'' evidence surfaced of at least
two massacres of civilians in the Drenica region within recent
days.
	   After a session of the Yugoslav government in Belgrade on
Friday, officials issued a statement saying the fighting had ended
and blaming continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels.

Fire in coops kills 12,000 chicks in Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A fire started by leaking fuel swept through
three chicken coops in the Nile Delta, killing 12,000 chicks, fire
officials said Saturday.
	   The fire broke out Friday when fuel from a kerosene heater used
to warm the coops caught fire, igniting the chicks straw bedding.
The chicks were about 15 days old.
	   Firefighters prevented the flames from spreading to the other
coops, where another 24,000 chicks were held, said the officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Losses were estimated at 40,000 Egyptian pounds (dlrs 12,000).
	   The farm is in the village of Kom Hamada, about 110 kilometers
(60 miles) north of Cairo.

Privatization will continue says Primakov
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with additional Primakov quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN IAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday that
the economic crisis would not bring an end to the government's
program of privatizing state property.
	   ``Privatization will be accomplished for growth of production,
growth of investment and growth of production effectiveness through
renewal of major funds,'' Primakov said during a meeting of Western
businessmen.
	   ``We shall conduct privatization so that it serves the interests
of the people, the state, and business,'' he said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Primakov reassured the businessmen, members of the prime
minister's consultive council on foreign investment in Russia, that
the government had no plans to ban the circulation of U.S. dollars
in Russia. But, he said, the government would take steps to staunch
the flow of dollars from Russia.
	   Responding to media reports of a government economic plan that
would prohibit Russians from buying U.S. dollars and other foreign
currency, Primakov said the reports ``absolutely do not correspond
to reality,'' ITAR-Tass quoted him as saying.
	   He said there was no need to regulate the influx of dollars into
Russia, but the government should take steps to prevent what he
called ``the dollar drain.''
	   Russian companies stashed about dlrs 2.5 billion outside the
country in September alone, the Interfax news agency reported
Friday, quoting central bank figures.
	   Primakov said foreign investors are ``the force'' that will help
Russia to minimize its losses from the current economic crisis.
	   ``We are very much interested in foreign investments, especially
in ones that go into the real production sector,'' Primakov said,
according to Interfax. ``We need a continuous dialogue with foreign
investors, without whom it will be difficult for us to overcome the
current difficulties.''
	   He said Russia wanted long-term investments. ``Foreign capital
has been coming to the country via short-term operations,''
Primakov said. This, he said, ``is not to our liking or yours.''
	   Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, said on Friday
that the government must act to stem the flow of dollars from
Russia.
	   Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov were in
Washington Saturday for the annual meeting of the International
Monetary Fund, where they plan to spell out the measures Russia is
taking to bail out its finance system.
	   Russia wants the IMF to release the second dlrs 4.3 billion
installment of a loan that was approved in July, a month before the
country's economy crashed and the government effectively defaulted
on its foreign loans.
	   IMF officials have said they want the Russian government to come
up with a sound economic program before the installment is given,
and have made it clear that currency controls and boosting the
money supply by printing rubles are not acceptable.

Balkan heads of state meet as NATO ponders strikes in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

Pangalos, Simitis. CHANGES byline &QL;

<TEXT>
	   DELPHI, Greece (AP) _ Western powers have blown the Kosovo
crisis out of all proportion, and the price of possible NATO
military strikes in the Serb province will be paid by neighboring
countries, Greece said Saturday.
	   Speaking in this home of the ancient oracle during the first day
of a trilateral meeting between leaders of Greece, Romania and
Bulgaria, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos prophesied
increasing problems for the Balkan peninsula.
	   The Kosovo crisis is of ``limited dimensions and concerns only
one country and is one problem,'' Pangalos said. ``Many people are
taking decisions for what is happening in the Balkans, but the
final price is paid for by the three countries meeting here.''
	   The trilateral meeting is being held just days before United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan is to submit a report on
Yugoslav compliance with a Security Council resolution, essentially
demanding an end to the Kosovo offensive by Serbian police and the
Yugoslav army.
	   The resolution threatens unspecified further action, seen by
many as the decision NATO needs for military intervention.
	   Romania, Bulgaria and Greece are concerned that an escalation of
the crisis could lead to a region-wide war. But they have all
expressed opposition to military intervention, fearing a repeat of
the Bosnian war and the sanctions that harmed their economies.
	   ``Our three countries have an interest and an imperative duty to
contribute with all their strength to ease the crisis which will
have generally unfavorable consequences for all the countries,''
Pangalos said.
	   ``We are showing our intention to contribute peacefully to the
solution of problems around us which directly concern us,'' he
added.
	   Greek Premier Costas Simitis said that European countries ``have
to take actions if necessary; positive actions, not negative
actions if they see that between the countries of the region there
is a common will to overcome problems.''
	   Presidents Petar Stoyanov of Bulgaria and Emil Constantinescu of
Romania will be holding extensive discussions on Kosovo with
Simitis at this ancient site, located on a rocky and forested
mountain 180 kilometers (112 miles) north of Athens.
	   Another key issue of the meeting is Bulgaria and Romania's
applications for entry into the European Union and NATO. Greece,
which is a member of both organizations, has been pushing the
candidacies in the hope of increasing stability in the volatile
Balkans.
	   The two countries ``are in a far better position to enter the EU
than many other candidates that are discussing now with the EU,''
Simitis said.
	   ``We think that there could be far more stability in Europe and
in the region if all three countries could participate in these two
European and international schemes,'' he added.
	   NATO and EU enlargement must encompass as many countries as
possible, Simitis noted.
	   ``A narrow enlargement would cause further division in the
continent,'' the Greek premier said. ``The enlargement should be
broad based and should promote security and stability in the whole
region.''

 &UR; Clashes for fourth day in divided West Bank town

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Clashes broke out in the center of this
West Bank town Saturday just after the Israeli army briefly lifted
a curfew to allow people to shop. Two Palestinians were hurt.
	   It marked the fourth day of skirmishing in Hebron, which is home
to 450 Jewish settlers and 130,000 Palestinians and a frequent
flashpoint for violence.
	   On Friday, seven Palestinians were injured, one seriously, in
clashes with Israeli soldiers. The Israeli-controlled center of
town has been under curfew since Wednesday, when two grenades were
thrown at Israeli security forces, wounding 22 people.
	   Saturday's fighting broke out just after the army called a
three-hour break in the curfew. A group of Palestinians threw
stones near a Jewish settlement in the center of town and Israeli
troops responded with rubber bullets, wounding two of them.
	   One of the injured Palestinians was taken into custody by the
Israeli troops, to cheers from settlers looking on.
	   The latest clashes come three days before the scheduled arrival
of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who will visit the
region to try to follow through on U.S.-brokered talks last week
aimed at setting terms for an Israeli pullback from the West Bank.
	   Accompanied by mediator Dennis Ross, Albright is to arrive in
the Middle East on Tuesday to prepare for an Israeli-Palestinian
summit in Washington on Oct. 15-19.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Friday that in advance
of that, the United States was trying to coax a pledge from Israel
to ease settlement activity in exchange for assurances from the
Palestinians that they will not encourage illegal construction.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet, meanwhile, said it would call on its
negotiators to ``work with all their ability'' to reach an accord.
But in a statement Saturday following their late-night meeting on
Friday, Palestinian ministers also called on Israel to approach the
new round of talks ``without the delaying tricks of the past.''
	   The latest peace efforts are shadowed by what Israel says is the
serious danger of new attacks by Islamic militants.
	   Israel closed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza Strip to
try to stave off what Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said were
plans for an ``unprecedented, horrific'' attack.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has killed scores of
Israelis in suicide bombings since 1994, vowed to carry out attacks
after Israeli soldiers killed two of the group's leaders last
month.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Friday that
security forces could not be totally effective in combating terror
groups.
	   ``We have to know that, during this fight, we will take some
blows,'' Netanyahu said on public television. ``We are working
against those murderers so there will be less attacks or none at
all.''
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the Palestinian
Authority has taken sporadic steps to control Hamas, but ``it's far
short of what we would like.''
	   Fogel warned that an attack would hurt the peace process. In the
past, Israel has suspended talks with the Palestinians after
large-scale attacks by Palestinian extremists.

Pediatrics organization expresses regret for tolerating Nazi

persecution &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) _ A pediatrics organization expressed
regret Saturday for not having defended hundreds of colleagues
persecuted, expelled or murdered by the Nazis from 1933-45.
	   The president of the German Society for Pediatrics, Lothar Pelz,
acknowledged that the majority of pediatricians of the era accepted
the Nazis' principle of ``Aryanization,'' expropriating Jewish
businesses and other assets.
	   Most of that generation of doctors ``did not resist as more than
700 Jewish or politically unacceptable colleagues saw their
existence destroyed,'' Pelz said. Later generations, he said, kept
silent.
	   Speaking at a gathering honoring colleagues persecuted by the
Nazis, Pelz said it was time to ``publicly acknowledge and to
express regret.''
	   The shame, ``of those events has not been eased,'' he said,
adding that he hoped that recalling ``the fate of our politically
persecuted, expelled and murdered colleagues'' would awaken the
consciousness of future generations.
	   The German Society for Pediatrics did not officially adopt
Aryanization as a policy, according to historians researching the
society's Nazi-era policies. However, researchers said the society
used ``internal tactics'' to expel non-Aryan doctors.

	   TASOVCICI, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ One Muslim returnee was
killed and three others injured when in a series of explosions
outside of Muslim homes in a southern Bosnian village,
international officials said Saturday.
	   The first explosion occurred late Friday, when an unidentified
attacker threw a handgrenade out of a passing car, said Kelly
Moore, spokeswoman for the United Nations in Bosnia. The grenade
rolled under a car parked in front of a Muslim-owned house and
exploded.
	   A group of seven Muslims and one Croat were standing in front of
the house, one was killed and three others injured, including
60-year-old Sakir Kudra.
	   ``Had (the bomb) not rolled under the car, more of us would be
dead,'' said Kudra.
	   The victim was identified as Adem Muminagic, 60.
	   Moore said four other attacks on Muslim houses in the village of
Tasovcici, 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Sarajevo, also
occurred late Friday and early Saturday. Noone was injured in these
attacks.
	   Chris Riley, a spokesman for Bosnian's top international
official, Carlos Westendorp, said his office ``strongly condemns
the violence'' and holds the local police and political leadership
responsible for the security of all citizens.
	   Some Muslims had returned two days ago to their homes Tasovcici,
in the Croat-dominated region of the Muslim-Croat Federation, under
an agreement between local officials.
	   Under the 1995 Dayton Peace agreement, Bosnia is divided into
the Serb republic and the joint Muslim-Croat federation. Clashes
between the Muslims and the Croats have plagued the federation
since its founding.
	   Incidents have increased in the region since Muslim refugees
began returning to the homes they were forced to flee during
fighting between Muslims and Croats in 1993.
	   According to Himzo Saric, representative of the Muslims in
Tasovcici, the latest incidents will not prevent the some 80 Muslim
families from returning to their homes in the sensitive region.
	   Also Saturday, the head of the United Nations mission in Bosnia
Elisabeth Rehn went to Mostar Saturday to meet with local leaders
and international officials to discuss the region's security
situation.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's top foreign-born sumo wrestler Akebono and
wife Christina Reiko Kalina held a gala, 1,300-guest wedding
ceremony at a Tokyo hotel Saturday.
	   U.S. Ambassador to Japan Thomas Foley and his wife Heather acted
as official go-betweens for the ceremony, and a telegram from U.S.
President Bill Clinton was read.
	   The Hawaii-born wrestler and Kalina officially married in April
in Tokyo and had a baby daughter in May.
	   The ceremony and reception for Kalina and the 204-centimeter
(6-foot-8), 232-kilogram (516-pound) Akebono, formerly known as
Chad Rowan, was nationally televised.
	   ``Akebono, you needed only five years to become yokozuna. Please
take time to build your life with your wonderful companion,'' said
Tokitsukaze, chairman of the Japan Sumo Association, using the term
for sumo grand champion.
	   Clad in traditional Japanese wedding attire of a golden
``hakama'' skirt and a white crested kimono, Akebono told
reporters: ``I hope to make a family that is bright and full of
friends who will visit often.''
	   Akebono met Kalina, a teacher at the American school on the U.S.
military base in Yokota, 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of
Tokyo, in 1988. Her American father serves in the U.S. military and
her mother is Japanese.

Kohl honored at last German Unity Day as chancellor

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Germany honored its ``unification
chancellor,'' Helmut Kohl, on Saturday for bringing the country
together eight years ago, while noting that serious problems that
resulted _ like high unemployment _ remain to be solved.
	   The nation's double-digit jobless rate, especially acute in the
former communist east, was the main reason behind Kohl's election
defeat last weekend. And chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder did not
shy away from the subject in his address at ceremonies to mark
German Unification Day.
	   ``Today is not a day on which something should be glossed over
or talked away,'' he said as Kohl looked impassively on. ``Above
all, (conquering) mass unemployment remains our main task.''
	   But Schroeder also used the opportunity to express his
``respect'' for Kohl's crowning achievement in 16 years as
chancellor: reunifying Germany.
	   ``I think this is a good moment to remind people about that,''
he said. ``And I'm sure the people of Germany won't forget it.''
	   His words brought sustained applause from the hundreds of
invited guests. ``Kohl lost the election, but that doesn't change
what he's done for Germany,'' one guest, Peter Imhoff, a state
official in Hesse, said afterward.
	   Kohl sat in the front row during the official ceremony at the
Hanover congress center, but did not speak. In a statement issued
earlier, he praised all that Germany had accomplished in bringing
east and west together since 1990's unification.
	   ``What we've attained with each other in the past eight years is
unprecedented in history,'' he said.
	   Schroeder, who led the Social Democrats' defeat of Kohl last
week, played host to the national celebrations in his role as
president of parliament's upper house.
	   Czech President Vaclav Havel, the guest of honor, said German
unification ``was good for the whole world'' because it meant the
end of an ``evil''' system of communism.
	   But Schroeder noted the economic and social upheaval that
followed the demise of East Germany has given rise to another
danger: growing support for neo-Nazi ideas, especially among
disoriented youth.
	   Germany can be proud that no far-right party even came close to
winning parliamentary seats in last week's election, he said.
	   ``But that shouldn't lead us to lose sight of the causes'' that
lead young people above all to vote for such parties, he said.
	   ``Radicalism always feeds itself on the fears and insecurities
in times of dramatic change'' _ not just unification, but the
tougher competition brought about by globalization.
	   Schroeder, who was expected to be sworn in as chancellor at the
end of the month, called for more attention to history and to more
job and training opportunities for young people.
	   The ceremony was preceded by a political fight over an original
musical work mixing portions of the German national anthem and the
one used in communist East Germany.
	   Conservatives accused Schroeder, whose state government
commissioned the piece, of desecrating the national anthem and
insulting the victims of East Germany's totalitarian regime.
Bavarian leaders boycotted the ceremony.
	   But even Kohl, who was among the critics, clapped politely when
``Variations on the Theme Germany'' was played. And German
President Roman Herzog dismissed the fuss as overblown.
	   ``Our state can endure that, and its symbols, when we value them
enough,'' he said.
	   The people of former East Germany will be remembered not by
their old anthem, he said, but by the chant heard during the
candlelight marches that eventually brought down the communist
leaders: ``We are the people.''

Mongolian democracy leader assassinated; leader calls for calm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS and UPDATES with comment &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL KOHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) _ President N. Bagabandi appealed for
calm Saturday following the assassination of a prominent democratic
leader, a killing that could further complicate a lengthy political
crisis.
	   Sanjaasuregiin Zorig, minister for infrastructure in the ruling
Democratic Coalition and a possible candidate for prime minister,
was axed and stabbed to death at his home late Friday night.
	   The murder may further shake public confidence in the fledgling
democracy, which has been embroiled for about four months in a
political stalemate that has paralyzed work on crucial economic
reforms.
	   ``I challenge everyone to be disciplined about this serious
crime that has shocked our society. I urge you not to get involved
in any kind of sensationalist stories,'' Bagabandi said in a public
address expressing condolences to the family of the slain
politician.
	   Bagabandi said he was confident that the attackers, who remained
at large, would be brought to justice.
	   The reason for Zorig's assassination remained unclear. Some
analysts speculated that the killing could have been linked to
organized crime or to a private business deal.
	   Zorig, a popular figure who played a leading role in the 1990
democratic revolution that ended seven decades of Stalinist rule,
had been widely expected to be named next week as a possible
successor to Prime Minister Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, who resigned on
July 24 along with his entire cabinet.
	   ``I can only express my shock and dismay at this tragic event.
Zorig was widely respected as a leader of the democratic movement
in Mongolia,'' said U.S. Ambassador Alphonse F. La Porta.
	   The ruling coalition has considered and failed to agree on four
earlier candidates. Zorig, a 36-year-old Moscow-educated former
social sciences professor and a member of parliament since 1990,
would have become the fifth nominee.
	   The crisis was precipitated when the three-month-old coalition
government lost a vote of confidence following a feud over whether
to merge a state bank with a private bank.
	   The opposition Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the
former communists, accused the government of organizing the merger
in a way that financially benefited its members and protested by
boycotting the Great Hural, Mongolia's parliament, throwing
proceedings into turmoil.
	   The coalition government had 30 days to reorganize itself and
nominate a new prime minister, but has failed to do so.
	   The political impasse has prevented work on crucial economic
legislation.
	   Mongolia, a landlocked Central Asian nation flanked by Russia
and China, used to be dependent on subsidies from Moscow and has
seen its economy weaken precipitously since the breakup of the
Soviet Union in 1991.
	   The vast, sparsely populated land was once the heart of the
largest empire the Earth ever knew. But according to World Bank
estimates, 36 percent of its 2 million people now live in poverty.
Inflation topped 30 percent last year and unemployment is high.
Forty percent of the population are nomadic herders.
	   Peaceful protests in 1990 forced the pro-Soviet People's
Revolutionary Party to drop communism and allow free and fair
multiparty elections. Its 75-year rule ended with a 1996
parliamentary election that swept the reformist Democratic Union
into office and won accolades for the nation's progress toward
democracy.

	   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) _ Australia's middle-order batsmen put
their team in firm control of the first cricket Test against
Pakistan on the third day of play Saturday.
	   Pakistan's sloppy ground fielding, coupled with some dropped
catches, helped Australia to post a nice 513 in reply to the home
team's first innings effort of 269.
	   It gave the visitors a substantial 244-runs lead and a solid
platform to go 1-0 up in the three-Test series.
	   Wicketkeeper Ian Healy was the last man out after playing a
fighting innings of 82 runs when he played to Muhammad Wasim in
Saqlain Mushtaq's over. Earlier, Darren Lehmann scored a gritty 98
and Steve Waugh carried his overnight total of 104 to 157, as the
Pakistan bowlers struggled on a slow turning wicket.
	   Overnight batsmen Steve Waugh and Darren Lehmann cut lose from
the start of play Saturday as Australia resumed at the overnight
total of 237 for four.
	   The pair produced 115 runs in 120 minutes with both batsmen
hitting a flurry of boundaries.
	   Lehmann survived a close call in leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed's
second over of the day when English umpire Peter Willey turned down
a vociferous bat and pad appeal.
	   However, the TV replays showed that the ball had brushed the
gloves of the left-hander after hitting the front pad and Lehmann
got the benefit of the doubt.
	   Lehmann fully profited from the chance and was especially harsh
on left-arm spinner Muhammad Hussain with some exquisite
strokeplay. He cut Hussain for two successive boundaries which
brought up his half century in only 68 balls.
	   Pakistan captain Aamir Sohail, who took a new ball after 93
overs, used all his six bowlers, but couldn't find the breakthrough
and the Australians went for lunch at 352 for four.
	   Soon after lunch, Pakistan had its first success when Steve
Waugh got the top edge to Sohail's left-arm spin straight to
Muhammad Wasim at short fine leg.
	   Waugh's 157-run innings was punctuated with 15 boundaries and a
six while he faced 325 deliveries in his 392 minutes of stay at the
wicket. Waugh's 126-run association for the fifth wicket with
Lehmann could prove a match winner.
	   Lehmann found another useful ally in wicketkeeper Ian Healy.
However, the scoring rate slowed slightly with the pair adding 76
runs during the post lunch session.
	   Healy on 24 was saved when Muhammad Wasim couldn't grab a second
slip catch off paceman Wasim Akram.
	   Lehman was bowled around his legs by left-arm spinner Hussain
when he was just two runs short of his maiden Test century. His
brilliant 98, a mixture of aggression and solid defense, featured
11 fours. Together with Healy, Lehmann put on an invaluable 91 runs
for the sixth wicket.
	   Akram picked up three wickets for 111 spinner Ahmed, Mushtaq and
Hussain all ended up with two wickets apiece.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Howard quote in 3rd graf; TRIMS &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard's
conservative government won re-election Saturday and claimed a
mandate to reform the nation's tax system despite a diminished grip
on Parliament.
	   With more than two-thirds of the vote counted, computer analysis
by the Australian Broadcasting Corp. showed the main opposition
Labor Party had won a big haul of votes away from the government,
but not enough to deliver them a majority in Parliament's House of
Representatives.
	   ``It is clear that the coalition will have a working majority in
the new Parliament,'' Howard said in a victory speech in Sydney.
``I want first and foremost to thank the Australian people for
returning the government.''
	   The conservatives held off a strong challenge from the far
right-wing One Nation party, which attracted about 8 percent of the
national vote.
	   One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, who exploded onto the
political scene about 18 months ago with proposals to freeze Asian
immigration and cut welfare programs for Aborigines, appeared not
to have been re-elected, calling into question the party's ability
to continue.
	   About 12 million registered voters cast their ballots at
thousands of polling booths in public buildings, from the nation's
desert Outback to its tropical north and in its modern, bustling
cities in the southeast.
	   Howard could take only limited comfort from the victory, with
voters deserting his governing coalition in droves to opposition
parties which may yet have the power to alter his tax plan.
	   In the outgoing parliament, Howard's governing conservatives
held 90 seats, Labor 49 and independents eight. A final official
outcome in all electorates may not be known for days, but the ABC
computer was predicting a conservative victory by eight seats _
down from the 41-seat majority it held going into the election.
	   Labor leader Kim Beazley appeared before cheering supporters in
Perth to say, ``I think a win by us is unlikely.''
	   But he was in a jovial mood over the gains Labor made in
Parliament, despite falling short of gaining government. The
jubilation of the crowd made it sound more like a victory party
than a concession speech.
	   Michael Parkin, a 30-year-old employee of Telstra Corp., said he
voted Labor as a protest against Howard's sell-off of one-third of
the partly government-owned telecommunications giant.
	   ``I voted Labor because of my job. Howard has just about sold
everything out from under me,'' Parkin said.
	   Howard staked his government's fate on what he calls
``economically radical'' tax reforms _ simplifying an antiquated
tax structure that has built up since the 1930s.
	   The centerpiece of the plan is a 10 percent tax on all goods and
services, which voters rejected outright at an election in 1993.
	   Beazley promised something far less painful: creation of 500,000
jobs. And he used a ``no tax'' promise to pull Labor close to
victory.
	   Labor was thrown out in a landslide victory for Howard in 1996.
	   With the historical odds against him, Beazley led Labor to a
strong recovery, probably capturing 16 of the 27 seats the party
needed for outright victory, the ABC reported., using vote counts
provided by the official Australian Election Commission.
	   The corporation feeds results into the computer as they are
counted officially, giving an almost real-time result on an
electorate-by-electorate basis.
	   The domestic news service Australian Associated Press also
predicted a conservative victory, but with a much diminished
majority.
	   Labor needed to hold all its current electorates and win 27 more
to seize a majority in the House of Representatives, the more
powerful chamber in Australia's bicameral Parliament.
	   Labor and the coalition had been in a dead heat for weeks,
according to the polls.
	   Casting his vote in his west coast electorate, Beazley predicted
before counting began that there would be a clear result by late
Saturday night. He was cautiously hopeful.
	   Voting in his Sydney electorate, Howard said he was nervous
about the outcome.
	   Even though Howard retained control in the House of
Representatives, where government is formed, polls have indicated
minor parties or independents again will hold the balance of power
in the upper house, meaning the government may have to negotiate to
get bills passed.
	   The ABC computer showed Senate voting trends in favor of
minority party the Democrats, which looked likely to hold the
balance of power.
	   Howard tried to soften his tax plan by linking it to income tax
cuts worth Australian dollars 13 billion (U.S. dlrs 7.6 billion) a
year and has promised to abolish a variety of other wholesale
taxes. But the income tax cuts are based on the uncertain
assumption that the Australian economy will continue to grow 3.5
percent a year to keep the federal budget in surplus.
	   Beazley promised to create a half-million jobs in three years
and called for income tax cuts targeting low-income earners. His
proposed cuts would have cost Australian dollars 3 billion (U.S.
dlrs 1.8 billion), an amount he said would be affordable even under
the International Monetary Fund's more modest growth projections.

Malaysia's first electronic hospital opens next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Despite the economic crisis,
Malaysia will open the first of three electronic hospitals with
state-of-the-art medical facilities next year, a news report said
Saturday.
	   The 530 million ringgit (dlrs 132 million) hospital outside
Kuala Lumpur will be the first in the world with comprehensive
electronic facilities, Minister of Health Chua Jui Meng was quoted
as saying by national news agency Bernama. It will have 960 beds.
	   The government has allocated about 2 billion ringgit (500
million) to build three electronic hospitals by 2000.
	   The hospitals will conduct administration and carry out medical
examinations using multimedia and Information Technology services
without using much paper or film.
	   Chua said the three hospitals would provide tele-medicine and
tele-health services to enable patients in Malaysia to consult
foreign medical experts without having to go abroad.

Pakistan sees third party mediation vital to resolve Kashmir
</HEADLINE>
dispute &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Less than two weeks ahead of fresh
talks with its uneasy neighbor India, Pakistan pressed on Saturday
for international mediation in the thorny Kashmir issue, the
flashpoint of two previous wars between the two countries.
	   India has rejected international involvement in what it
considers a bilateral issue.
	   The two countries have been at odds over ownership of a united
Kashmir, which was divided between India and Pakistan when the
Asian subcontinent gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   ''The bilateral dialogue in the past has not yielded positive
results. Only third party mediation has proved fruitful,'' foreign
ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf said in Islamabad.
	   Pakistan and India resume stalled talks on Kashmir in Islamabad
on Oct. 15. Kashmir is the only Muslim majority state in
Hindu-dominated India.
	   The three-day talks are also meant to ease tensions between
these two newest nuclear powers and for the discussion of
confidence-building measures.
	   Tensions in South Asia escalated after India conducted a series
of nuclear tests in May and Pakistan matched them with a similar
series the same month.
	   Altaf said Islamabad did not expect quick results from its talks
with India.
	   ''Our aim, nevertheless, is to sincerely attempt to find a just
settlement of ... the dispute,'' he said.
	   He said once the Kashmir problem is resolved, there will be
''unlimited possibilities of cooperation and normal and good
relations'' between the two countries.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The monkey clapped, the donkey waved its ears and
the eagle flapped its wings as, one-by-one, they and a host of
other pets were blessed Saturday at a special church service
celebrating all God's creatures.
	   The Rev. Ernest Hunt intoned the opening of the service at the
American Cathedral of the Holy Trinity after a rousing chorus of
``All Things Bright and Beautiful.''
	   Pets ``love us regardless of how we dress, how successful we are
or how much money we have,'' he said.
	   The service, conducted in French and English, was in honor of
St. Francis of Assisi, that renowned animal lover, and included
several special prayers and Bible readings in honor of animals.
	   Among the creatures in attendance were two baby panthers, a
llama, a pony and little goats, along with an array of cats and
dogs.
	   ``I was here last year and enjoyed it a lot,'' said Michael
Flaesch, ``and so did my eagle, Colorado,'' who parked his claws on
Flaesch's shoulder under the church's sculpted lectern eagle.
	   Desire Rech, from the Kinos Circus, was also happy with the
service, just like his sweat-shirted monkey who clapped with
apparent delight.
	   ``We had such a great turnout at our first event last year that
we decided to repeat it,'' Hunt said.
	   Veterinarian Michel Klein, who also works at the Paris School of
Guide Dogs for the Blind, gave a homily to man's best friend, ``so
often giving the only real affection to lonely people in today's
society,''
	   Then, one by one, the animals were blessed at the choir steps,
before the final hymn, ``All Creatures of our God and King.''
	   ``Vladimir loved it, didn't you, Vladdie?'' said Noelle
d'Aulnay, cooing to her poodle.
	   The animals were more curious than flustered, with only a tiny
puddle betraying one dog's nervousness.

German model, at Milan shows, says she quitting catwalk

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Claudia Schiffer says she won't be parading
down the catwalks any more. She'd rather design the clothes the
other top models are wearing on them.
	   Surrounded by photographers and TV crews, the German superstar
of fashion runways told reporters in Milan as the latest shows
kicked off that she intends to become a designer herself.
	   ``I love fashion but I never really liked the runway,'' she was
quoted as saying in Saturday's Il Messaggero, a Rome daily.
``Cinema and advertising are much better. I'm leaving.''
	   But Schiffer's blond locks might not entirely be absent from the
runways. She came to Milan to model the Marchese Coccapani
collection for ``my friend Giorgio Ferrari,'' and, ``for him, I'll
always come.''
	   She showed up to model just one Coccapani number on Friday, a
silver-colored knit sheath.
	   Schiffer has lots of commercial interests, ranging from filming
a series of exercise tapes to doing ads for cosmetics and
automobiles, including one spot in which she flings a pair of
panties out a car window.

General Assembly debate actually produces some moves towards peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With a global economic crisis looming and
conflicts creating turmoil in more than 30 hotspots, world leaders
came to the United Nations over the past two weeks _ and made some
surprising moves towards easing global tensions.
	   After detonating nuclear devices in May, India and Pakistan
announced plans to adhere to the nuclear test ban treaty within the
next year, which would slow the South Asian arms race.
	   Benjamin Netanyahu announced Israel will shortly hand over 13
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians, and Yasser Arafat
backed down from unilaterallly declaring that a Palestinian state
would be in place by May 4, 1999, the deadline for implementing the
Middle East peace accords.
	   Iran's moderate government distanced itself from a dlrs 2.5
million reward for killing Salman Rushdie, author of ``The Satanic
Verses'' which religious leaders claimed blasphemed Islam,
prompting a positive response from Western ministers.
	   Nigeria's new leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, committed his
military government to fair elections and a return to civilian rule
next year, key Western demands to end the country's pariah status.
	   Still, many of the world's conflicts showed no signs of cooling
down.
	   There was no progress on reunification of Cyprus, divided since
1974 when Turkey occupied the north of the island nation. The
border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea remained tense. Congo
accused neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of invading the country and
massacring thousands of innocent Congolese. Rwanda and Uganda
denied the allegations and blamed Congo for slaughtering innocent
men, women and children.
	   And the threat of NATO military strikes against Serb targets in
Kosovo grew, following the broadcast and publication of gruesome
pictures of massacred ethnic Albanians. Survivors blamed Serb
forces trying to crush independence-seeking ethnic Albanians.
	   The U.N. Security Council on Thursday condemned the massacres,
but didn't assign blame or add any new legal backing for any NATO
action.
	   Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic denied any new
attacks in Kosovo and insisted his country wanted ``direct,
unconditional'' dialogue with the ethnic Albanians _ which they
have rejected _ to resolve the conflict peacefully.
	   Old Cold War opponents still shouted at each other.
	   North Korea, the most rigid remaining communist state, accused
its South Korean rivals of being ``running dogs'' of the Americans.
And the Cubans and Americans volleyed in the assembly debate for
two rounds over the U.S. embargo and the refusal of the Western
hemisphere's only communist state to hold democratic elections.
	   With a new millennium just two years away, many leaders wondered
aloud how the international community can deal with the issues
heaped on the global plate _ from the growing number of conflicts
in Africa to the growing gap between rich and poor and the growing
threat of international terrorism.
	   ``Mankind is increasingly feeling the breathing of the 21st
century,'' said Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
	   Nations will live ``in peace and harmony'' once they recognize
their interdependence and start to seek collective responses to the
challenges of the time, he said.
	   Eager to forge a more collective response, many nations
suggested ways for reforming the U.N. Security Council to make it
more representative of the world _ and more responsive to the needs
of developing countries. But talk of expanding the council _
effectively the U.N. board of directors _ is hopelessly stalled
over who should get to join the exclusive club.
	   And the growth of global financial markets, the inter-linked
national economies and the spreading economic crisis has no easy
solution.
	   ``The poorest countries are the traumatized victims of this
reality; but the whole world community can be threatened by a
situation that will affect even the most advanced countries,''
Ivanov said.

Proposal expected to ease Thai abortion law for HIV mothers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's justice ministry will
propose amending the country's tough abortion law to give
HIV-infected women the right to end their pregnancies, a local
newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The right will also apply in cases where fetuses are diagnosed
with physical and mental disabilities, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   The proposal, to be announced next Tuesday by the ministry,
calls for abortions to be granted only with the consent of both the
mother and a doctor.
	   Under the current law, abortions can legally be carried out by
qualified doctors only on rape victims or to protect the mother's
health.
	   A report from the country's leading medical institution, Mahidol
University, said 62,000 babies are expected to contract HIV from
their mothers by 2000, and 47,000 of these are expected to develop
full-blown AIDS, the Post reported.
	   Past attempts to amend the abortion law have run into stiff
opposition from religious groups and conservative politicians.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Jordan, Kuwait &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Authorities have detained more than 400
illegal Asian workers in a sweep of the Jordanian capital as part
of a campaign to combat unemployment among Jordanians.
	   A Labor Ministry official said Saturday workers seized in the
sweep, which began Wednesday, were mostly from the Philippines and
Sri Lanka.
	   They provided janitorial services to some Western diplomatic
missions here, but had no work permits, the official said on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   It was not immediately clear if they will be deported in line
with regulations enforced recently to rid cash-strapped Jordan of
an estimated 150,000 foreigners working here without permits.
	   An additional 150,000 foreigners have permits from the Labor
Ministry, which moderately estimates unemployment at 14.4 percent
of the 950,000-strong labor force. Unofficial estimates are twice
that figure.
	   The bulk of the foreign laborers are Egyptians working in
construction, hotels and agriculture.
	   The government, which took office Aug. 20, has vowed to
restructure the labor market by gradually replacing foreigners with
Jordanians and banning the employment of foreigners in certain
unskilled jobs.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait may build a fourth oil refinery, a senior
Kuwait Petroleum Corp. official said in remarks published Saturday.
	   Nader Sultan, chief executive officer of the state-owned KPC,
told the Arab Times daily a refinery was being considered to meet
the country's growing energy demands. He did not elaborate, but
said the new plant would use Kuwait's heavier crude oils.
	   This small oil-rich state has three refineries in Shuaiba, Mina
al-Ahmedi and Mina Abdullah with a total capacity of around 870,000
barrels a day.
	   KPC owns and runs the Gulf country's upstream and downstream
operations domestically and abroad.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ German exports to Kuwait in the first five months
of the year reached dlrs 226 million, up 27 percent from the
corresponding period in 1997, the Kuwait News Agency reported
Saturday.
	   Quoting German Embassy figures, KUNA said 66 percent of these
exports were machinery and electrical appliances while cars made up
26.1 percent, and food 7 percent.
	   The report did not provide any figures for Kuwaiti exports to
Germany, but said they include crude and oil products.
	   The embassy said a group of German businessmen will visit this
small Gulf state the end of this month to explore further trade
opportunities.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serb-appointed interim council for
Kosovo announced Saturday it would work to ``normalize conditions''
in the province, where Serbian authorities are eager to show world
leaders their interest in a peaceful solution to the bloody
conflict.
	   The Serbs are anxious to avoid NATO airstrikes and are making
last ditch efforts to show their progress towards ending the
conflict. But ethnic Albanian political leaders have rejected the
council as a ``body formed by Serbian authorities,'' not a body
that would be part of Kosovo self-rule.
	   The body, appointed by the Serbian parliament last week,
includes a Serb prime minister and an 17 other governing members,
comprised of both Serbs and ethnic Albanians and is envisaged as an
interim government to deal with local issues in Kosovo.
	   ``Our task is to normalize conditions as soon as possible and
create conditions for local elections in Kosovo,'' Zoran
Andjelkovic, the council's prime minister said at Saturday's
opening session. ``I hope we will not last for a very long time,
because that means we will be successful.''

Cable car sliced by U.S. Marine jet to reopen by Christmas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Alpine ski lift whose line was sliced by a U.S.
Marine jet in February, sending 20 people to their deaths, will
reopen by Christmas.
	   Officials from the northern area of Trento said Saturday the
cable line and gondolas had been completely rebuilt and would be
taking skiers up Mount Cermis. The exact opening date depends on
when the first snow of the season falls.
	   The lift departs from Cavalese, a town in a region whose economy
is based primarily on tourism and which suffered a major blow
following the Feb. 3 tragedy.
	   Evidence showed the Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler, which took off
from a nearby base, was flying too fast and too low when it sliced
the cable.
	   The United States has provided funds to the victims' families as
well as to the Trento region to help restore tourism.
	   The jet's pilot and navigator face a court-martial this winter
on 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide, as
well as dereliction of duty, destroying military property and
destroying civilian property.

 &UR; Clashes for fourth day in divided West Bank town &QL;

 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Clashes broke out in the center of the
West Bank town of Hebron on Saturday just after the Israeli army
briefly lifted a curfew to allow people to shop. Two Palestinians
were hurt.
	   It marked the fourth day of skirmishing in Hebron, which is home
to 450 Jewish settlers and 130,000 Palestinians and is a frequent
flashpoint for violence.
	   On Friday, seven Palestinians were injured, one seriously, in
clashes with Israeli soldiers. The Israeli-controlled center of
town has been under curfew since Wednesday, when two grenades were
thrown at Israeli security forces, wounding 22 people.
	   Saturday's fighting broke out just after the army called a
three-hour break in the curfew. A group of Palestinians threw
stones near a Jewish settlement in the center of town and Israeli
troops responded with rubber bullets, wounding two Palestinians.
	   One of the injured Palestinians was taken into custody by the
Israeli troops, to cheers from settlers looking on.
	   The latest clashes come three days before the scheduled arrival
of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was to visit the
region to try to follow through on U.S.-brokered talks last week
aimed at setting terms for an Israeli pullback from the West Bank.
	   Accompanied by mediator Dennis Ross, Albright was to arrive in
the Middle East on Tuesday to prepare for an Israeli-Palestinian
summit in Washington on Oct. 15-19.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Friday that in advance
of that, the United States was trying to coax a pledge from Israel
to ease settlement activity in exchange for assurances from the
Palestinians that they will not encourage illegal construction.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet, meanwhile, said it would call on its
negotiators to ``work with all their ability'' to reach an accord.
But in a statement Saturday following their late-night meeting on
Friday, Palestinian ministers also called on Israel to approach the
new round of talks ``without the delaying tricks of the past.''
	   The latest peace efforts are shadowed by what Israel says is the
serious danger of new attacks by Islamic militants.
	   Israel closed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza Strip to
try to stave off what Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said were
plans for an ``unprecedented, horrific'' attack.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has killed scores of
Israelis in suicide bombings since 1994, vowed to carry out attacks
after Israeli soldiers killed two of the group's leaders last
month.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned on Friday that
security forces could not be totally effective in combating terror
groups.
	   ``We have to know that, during this fight, we will take some
blows,'' Netanyahu said on public television. ``We are working
against those murderers so there will be less attacks or none at
all.''
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the Palestinian
Authority has taken sporadic steps to control Hamas, but ``it's far
short of what we would like.''
	   Fogel warned that an attack would hurt the peace process. In the
past, Israel has suspended talks with the Palestinians after
large-scale attacks by Palestinian extremists.

Embattled author seeks international support for her safety

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Author Taslima Nasrin, who faces death
threats from religious extremists and a warrant for her arrest,
sought world intervention Saturday to assure her safety in
Bangladesh.
	   ``I need protection for my life. The international community
should come forward to ensure my safety,'' Nasrin, 36, told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview from her hideout.
	   She said she appealed to the British chapter of the
international writers' group PEN to contact the Bangladesh
government and protect her from Islamic extremists who have offered
a reward of 200,000 takas (dlrs 5,000) to anyone who kills her.
	   On Saturday, nearly 2,000 Islamic extremists, wearing white
prayer caps, marched through the streets of Dhaka chanting death
threats to Nasrin.
	   ``We shall try the infidel on the soil of Bangladesh and put her
to death,'' read a banner waved by protesters from the Islamic
Constitution Movement.
	   After a 4-year self-imposed exile, Nasrin returned home from New
York in September and said she wanted to nurse her 60-year-old
mother, who has colon cancer.
	   ``I want my freedom back,'' Nasrin said. ``This is my country
and I've every right to freely live here.''
	   After the state filed charges against her in 1994 for
blaspheming Islam, Nasrin went into hiding for two months to avoid
death threats until a court granted her bail and allowed her to
leave the country. Since then, she has lived in Europe and the
United States, supported by PEN.
	   Ten days after her homecoming, a Dhaka magistrate revived
another 1994 arrest warrant issued in a civil suit, filed in
addition to the state-sponsored criminal case.
	   Her return prompted renewed street protests by Islamic
conservatives who call for her death by public hanging, even though
the offense she is accused of carries a maximum punishment of two
years in jail.
	   An alliance of several Islamic groups planned a bigger protest
in the Bangladeshi capital for Sunday.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Less than two weeks ahead of fresh
talks with its uneasy neighbor India, Pakistan pressed on Saturday
for international mediation in the thorny Kashmir issue, the
flashpoint of two previous wars between the two countries.
	   India has rejected international involvement in what it
considers a bilateral issue.
	   The two countries have been at odds over ownership of a united
Kashmir, which was divided between India and Pakistan when the
Asian subcontinent gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   ''The bilateral dialogue in the past has not yielded positive
results. Only third party mediation has proved fruitful,'' foreign
ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf said in Islamabad.

The palace lies? Prince Andrew says he was misquoted
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with palace statement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rebutting tabloid headlines, Prince Andrew said
Saturday that he never accused anyone at Buckingham Palace of lying
to the press.
	   ``The point I was making to journalists was that they should
check royal stories with the palace before they were written. I
wish to confirm that at no stage am I aware of anybody deliberately
responding incorrectly to inquiries,'' Andrew told Press
Association, the British news agency.
	   The mass-circulation Mirror told a different tale Saturday
morning. ``We've lied to you for 20 years,'' said the headline
leading its story of an interview with Andrew at a reception in
Malta on Thursday.
	   The Mirror quoted him as saying: ``The difficulty is trying to
convince you that you are being told the truth because you can't
believe you're being told the truth. For the last 20 years, you
probably haven't. It's like the Russians.''
	   The Sun said in its report that Andrew ``admitted yesterday that
courtiers constantly lied to the public and press for 20 years.''
	   Those reports ruffled Michael Shea, who was press secretary to
Queen Elizabeth II from 1978 to 1987.
	   ``I have never lied in my life. I don't know anything about
it,'' The Daily Telegraph quoted Shea as saying.
	   The press office at Buckingham Palace issued a statement denying
the newspaper reports.
	   ``Further to certain articles that have appeared in this
morning's press, the Duke of York (Andrew) wishes to make clear
that the inference that palace officials had lied to the media in
the past is incorrect,'' the palace statement said.

Lock of beheaded king's hair fetches dlrs 5,536
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GRENOBLE, France (AP) _ A lock of King Louis XVI's gray hair,
shorn minutes after the monarch was beheaded during the French
Revolution 205 years ago, was auctioned off Saturday for 31,000
francs (dlrs 5,536).
	   A French collector who asked not to be identified by name
acquired the hair, encased in a period frame decorated with a gold
coin and three ``fleurs de lys,'' the symbol of French royalty.
	   Bidding for the lock began at 10,000 francs (dlrs 1,785) at the
Clarine du Fontanil hotel, in Fontanil, near Grenoble.
	   Certificates on the back of the frame say the hair was cut off
just moments after the king was beheaded on Jan. 21, 1793, at the
Place de la Concorde in Paris.
	   A drummer near the scaffold was said to have cut off several
locks after trapping the king's head with his foot. He later
distributed them among the king's supporters.
	   Experts had predicted that bidding would sore above 20,000
francs (dflrs 3,570).
	   ``It's a rare piece,'' local antiques expert Roland Del-Balzo,
said last week.
	   No forensic tests have been conducted to prove the hair belonged
to the monarch. But Del-Balzo said the family who sold it had the
certificates to prove it.
	   The family, from Grenoble, has requested it not be identified.
	   Del-Balzo said the value is enhanced by the two certificates on
the frame detailing two previous sales of the lock of hair _ in
1810 and 1880.
	   King Louis XVI lived from 1754 to 1793.

Iran seizes 5 tons of drugs, says produced by Taliban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian police have confiscated more than
five metric tons (5.5 short tons) of drugs that they say were
produced by Afghanistan's Taliban militia, the Kayhan newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   The drugs, confiscated over the past couple of days, included
heroin, opium and morphine, said the paper quoting the chief of
police in the northeastern Khorasan province, which borders
Afghanistan.
	   ``Because of the high market value of these drugs in Europe, the
Taliban have been especially active in producing and smuggling
them,'' the paper quoted police chief Bahran Nourowzi as saying.
	   It did not give details about the seizure or say if any arrests
were made.
	   Washington and Tehran believe that the drug trade helps finance
the Taliban militia, which rules over 90 percent of Afghanistan.
	   Iran asked that the United Nations speed up plans to develop
alternative livelihoods for poppy growers in Afghanistan, which,
together with Burma, accounts for 90 percent of the world's supply
of opium _ the raw material used to produce heroin.
	   Large drug hauls are common in Iran, which lies on a route used
by smugglers to get drugs from Pakistan and Afghanistan to the
oil-rich Gulf and Europe.
	   Iran has been cracking down on drug smugglers since 1988.
Hundreds of traffickers have been hanged under a law that mandates
the death penalty for anyone caught with more than a small quantity
of narcotics.

Yemen executes man for murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A man convicted of murder was executed in a
public square in the capital San`a, the al-Thawra government
newspaper reported Saturday.
	   It said Mohammed Ahmed Awad was shot dead by a firing squad on
Friday in front of a large crowd that included the victim's family.
	   Awad was convicted of fatally shooting Mohsen Mohammed Bajassar
in August 1997, the paper said. It gave no details of the crime.
	   Yemen, an impoverished country at the tip of the Arabian
Peninsula, imposes the death penalty for rape and murder. Most
executions are carried out in public to set an example.

Macau police arrest four suspects in pre-dawn raids
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Police armed with rifles raided a hotel and a
karaoke bar early Saturday and arrested four men _ including two
former police officers _ suspected in bomb attacks in this
Portuguese enclave.
	   Police said they believed the suspects were involved in a bomb
attack in May in which the car of Macau's police director, Marquest
Baptista, was destroyed.
	   The arrested men were also suspected of a car bombing last month
that injured five police officers and 10 journalists, police said.
	   They are also believed to be members of gangs dealing in
prostitution and the trafficking of illegal immigrants, police
added.
	   Macau, famous for its gambling and tourism, has been hit in the
past two years with gangland-style killings, arson and other
attacks _ many against government officials.
	   Police believe triads, or Chinese gangs, are fighting over
profits from the gambling industry, which have been dwindling
because of Asia's economic slump.
	   Earlier this month, China said it would send an elite detachment
of soldiers to the territory to protect social order after it
reverts to Chinese rule next year.

Ukrainian president appeals to court over communal services' cost
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma has asked Ukraine's
Constitutional Court to rule on the validity of legislation banning
price increases for utilities and public transportation.
	   Kuchma said parliament overstepped its authority by adopting the
law, the presidential press service reported Saturday.
	   Kuchma also noted that the law would have negative economic
consequences and asked the court to consider his appeal urgently,
it said.
	   Ukraine's government had planned to increase rates for
``communal services'' such as rent and utilities and fees for
public transport, and to cancel all state subsidies for utilities
by the end of 1998 at the urging of the International Monetary
Fund.
	   But the leftist-dominated parliament passed a law banning the
planned hike. Kuchma vetoed the legislation, but in September, 317
deputies in Ukraine's 450-seat Verkhovna Rada voted to override
that veto.
	   Ukrainians currently pay only 80 percent of the total cost of
communal services, including apartment fees and payments for gas,
water and heating.
	   Lawmakers argue that any further raise in communal payments
would only increase the population's mounting debt.
	   Ukrainians owe their government more than 3 billion hryvna
(about dlrs 1 billion) for communal services, and many debtors have
not paid their bills months, according to government figures.

Shiite Muslim judge escapes car bomb in Pakistan, four others
</HEADLINE>
wounded

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ A Shiite Muslim judge escaped an
assassination attempt Saturday in eastern Punjab province.
	   The authorities said four other people were wounded when a bomb
planted in Judge Zawar Hussain's car exploded just moments after he
left the car.
	   Police said two policemen were among the injured in the
explosion in Bahwalpur city, some 280 kilometers (168 miles) south
of the Punjab capital of Lahore.
	   Police suspects Sunni Muslim extremists were responsible for the
attack, although no one claimed responsibility.
	   Sunni and Shiite Muslim militant groups are locked in a fierce
sectarian war which has left hundreds of people dead over the last
few years.
	   Sectarian violence intensified following the killing of four
Sunni Muslim leaders in the capital Islamabad in September.
	   Shiites Muslims comprise 15 percent of the population in
Sunni-dominated Pakistan.

One dead as severe flooding hits Thai capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ One person was killed in the worst
flooding to hit the Thai capital this year, officials said
Saturday.
	   Heavy rain Thursday night overwhelmed the city's flood stations,
with major canals and drainage system overflowing, Bangkok City
Clerk Prasert Samalapa was quoted as saying by The Nation
newspaper.
	   Drainage pumps in some areas stopped working for hours due to
blackouts.
	   Police said one man was electrocuted while walking through flood
waters into which electrical cables had apparently fallen.
	   The eastern part of the capital was reported to have taken the
heaviest pounding, with two major districts remain submerged under
about 50 centimeters (20 inches) of water for almost 24 hours.
	   The flooding, which extended into Friday, left thousands of
people stranded in one district which commuter buses and taxis were
unable to enter because of the high water level. Nine city schools
were closed Friday while many shops closed to repair water damage.
	   The meteorological department meanwhile reportedly warned that
the worst may be yet to come, with more torrential rains expected
to hit the city soon.

Fire in shops kills three people in southern China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Fire raged through 17 shops selling car
accessories in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou early
Saturday, killing three people, a Chinese news agency reported.
	   The China News Service in Hong Kong said the fire broke out at
2.20 a.m. and spread rapidly through the shops near the city's east
railway station. The report said some people were asleep in the
shops at the time.
	   The agency quoted a witness as saying he believed the fire was
caused by a short circuit of an electric wire outside one of the
shops.

Ukraine's chief banker says economic situation improving
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's chief banker said the country's
economic situation has improved in recent days and that the hryvna
currency has stabilized within a government-set fluctuation band,
the bank's press service reported Saturday.
	   The main task now is to maintain that stabilization and ensure
that the hryvna strengthens, said the National Bank chairman,
Viktor Yushchenko.
	   ``The key thing is that we have managed to separate ourselves
from the Russian economic crisis and its negative influence, but we
must do much now to develop the Ukrainian economy,'' Yushchenko
told Ukrainian reporters.
	   Ukraine, which has suffered economic problems since the 1991
collapse of the Soviet Union, has been hit especially hard by the
crisis in neighboring Russia, its main trading partner.
	   The crisis has hurt Ukrainian exports and other bilateral trade,
led to a withdrawal of investors and caused the hryvna currency to
fall, forcing the government to introduce a new currency trading
band.
	   The hryvna traded at about 2.1 to the U.S. dollar before the
crisis hit in August, and it has slipped to 3.41 on Friday, nearly
breaching the lowest 3.5 limit of the band. President Leonid Kuchma
met with top economic officials on Friday to discuss ways to
stabilize the currency.
	   Despite Yushchenko's comments, many analysts believe the present
rate to be unrealistic and artificially maintained by regulations
forcing exporters to sell much of their foreign currency earnings
to the state.
	   The government and the National Bank also are restricting dollar
purchase requests from commercial banks and limiting the amount of
dollars available for sale daily on the currency exchange market to
a meager dlrs 17 million to dlrs 20 million.
	   Still, there are wide expectations in Ukraine that the hryvna
will fall further, and Ukrainians have been stocking up on food,
clothing and household goods to save their fast-devaluing money.
	   Yushchenko also said the recent conversion of government bonds,
criticized by many foreign investors, in fact has proved their
belief in Ukraine.
	   He said 73 percent of non-resident investors have agreed to
convert their treasury bills before the government offer expired on
Friday, but gave no details about the rest.
	   ``It is very important that 73 percent of foreign investors have
stayed in Ukraine in those hard times. It's an evidence of their
trust in our country,'' said Yushchenko.
	   The government has launched the conversion because its budget
revenues _ harmed by poor tax collection _ were insufficient to
cover debt obligations.
	   Foreigners were offered to redeem 20 percent of the bonds
immediately and to change the rest into Eurobonds with a 20 percent
annual interest rate. The bonds are to be redeemed in September and
December 2000.
	   Foreign investors are holding an estimated 1.8 billion hryvna
(dlrs 530 million at the current rate) in Ukrainian bonds,
originally slated to mature by August 1999.

Marinos stay on top in Japan's professional soccer league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Norio Omura and Shoji Jo scored as the 1995
champion Yokohama Marinos beat Consadole Sapporo 2-0 Saturday and
stayed on top of the second-stage table of the 18-team Japanese
professional soccer league.
	   With eight wins against one defeat, the Marinos stayed two
points ahead of the 1997 champion and first first-stage winner
Jubilo Iwata, who blanked Yokohama Flugels 4-0.
	   Omura took advantage of a defensive goof of Sapporo to strike in
the 34th minute. Jo's header in the 70th minute was his fourth goal
in his last three games.
	   Masashi Nakayama scored his fifth hat trick of the season,
leading Iwata to its seventh straight victory for a 7-2 record and
21 points.
	   Urawa Reds snapped its two-match losing streak as teen striker
Shinji Ono and Italian defender Giuseppe Zappella scored for a 2-0
win over Avispa Fukuoka.
	   With a 7-2 mark and 21 points but with less goals for, Urawa
stands third on the table.
	   Brazilian Mazinho struck twice as Kashima Antlers beat Kashiwa
Reysol 3-0 and placed fourth, also at 21 points.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard's
conservative government on Saturday narrowly won re-election and
the chance to reform the nation's tax system, but at the cost of a
greatly diminished majority in Parliament.
	   The Australian Broadcasting Corp. predicted the conservatives
lost at least 20 of their previous 41-seat majority.
	   But they will be in office to preside over the Sydney 2000
Olympics, the centenary of Australia's federation as a nation in
2001, and the country's entry into the new millennium.
	   ``It is clear that the coalition will have a working majority in
the new Parliament,'' Howard told cheering supporters at his
victory rally in Sydney.
	   ``I want first and foremost to thank the Australian people for
returning the government. I want to thank the Australian people for
embracing a bold economic reform that is in the long-term interest
of the Australian community.''
	   But it was far that from clear that most Australians were
enthusiastic about Howard's reforms, which include a new 10 percent
tax on all goods and services.
	   Howard's majority was eroded as voters deserted him in droves
for opposition parties that may yet be able to block his tax
reforms and his plan to sell off the rest of the national telephone
company, Telstra Corp., in the Senate.
	   Michael Parkin, a 30-year-old employee of Telstra, said he voted
Labor as a protest against Howard's sell-off of one third of the
partly government-owned telecommunications giant.
	   ``I voted Labor because of my job. Howard has just about sold
everything out from under me,'' Parkin said.
	   With 80 percent of the vote counted, ABC and the domestic news
agency Australian Associated Press said the main opposition Labor
Party led by Kim Beazley had cut deep into Howard's parliamentary
majority, but not enough to win government.
	   Beazley appeared before cheering supporters in his West
Australian district of Brand, south of Perth, to say: ``I think a
win by us is unlikely.''
	   But he was in a jovial mood over the gains Labor made in
Parliament, despite falling short of gaining government. The
jubilation of the crowd made it sound more like a victory party
than a concession speech.
	   ``In conclusion, I'm proud to say the Labor Party is back in
town. We approach the next three years with great confidence,''
Beazley said.
	   The conservatives also held off a strong challenge from the far
right-wing One Nation party, which attracted about 8 percent of the
national vote.
	   One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, who exploded onto the
political scene about 18 months ago with proposals to freeze Asian
immigration and cut welfare programs for Aborigines, appeared not
to have been re-elected, calling into question the party's
viability.
	   About 12 million registered voters cast their ballots at
thousands of polling booths in public buildings, from the nation's
desert Outback to its tropical north and in its modern, bustling
cities in the southeast.
	   Howard staked his government's fate on what he called
``economically radical'' tax reforms _ simplifying an antiquated
tax structure that has been built up since the Depression era of
the 1930s.
	   The plan appealed to Ian Montcrieff, a 73-year-old self-funded
retiree who said Howard was taking a ``brave approach.''
	   ``I'm very keen for the tax reforms to come through,''
Montcrieff said in Sydney.
	   The centerpiece of his plan is a 10 percent tax on all goods and
services, which voters rejected outright at an election in 1993.
	   Howard tried to soften his tax plan by linking it to income tax
cuts worth Australian dollars 13 billion (U.S. dlrs 7.6 billion) a
year and has promised to abolish a variety of other wholesale
taxes. But the income tax cuts are based on the uncertain
assumption that the Australian economy will continue to grow 3.5
percent a year to keep the federal budget in surplus.
	   Beazley promised something far less painful: the creation of a
half-million jobs in three years and income tax cuts targeting
low-income earners. And he hammered at a ``no sales tax'' promise
to pull Labor within striking distance of victory.
	   Beazley led Labor to a strong recovery but fell short of
capturing the 27 seats the party needed to seize a majority in the
House of Representatives, according to the Australian Broadcasting
Corp.
	   The final election result may not be decided for days, depending
on the large number of postal votes due to the school holidays and
Labor Day long weekend in the eastern states and South Australia.
	   In the outgoing parliament, Howard's governing conservatives
held 91 seats, Labor 49 and independents eight.
	   According to the ABC, the new House of Representatives lineup is
likely to be: the conservative coalition with 71 seats, the Labor
Party 64 seats, one independent and about 12 undecided.
	   Labor and the coalition had been in a dead heat for weeks,
according to the polls.
	   Even with Howard in control in the House of Representatives,
minor parties or independents again will hold the balance of power
in the upper house, meaning the government may have to negotiate to
get bills passed.
	   The ABC computer showed Senate voting trends in favor of the
Democrats, a minority that looked likely to hold the balance of
power.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serb-appointed council meant to
serve as an interim government in Kosovo announced Saturday that it
will try to ``normalize conditions'' in the rebellious province,
where Serbian authorities are eager to display an interest in
peace.
	   The Serbs, anxious to avoid NATO airstrikes, are making a
last-ditch effort to show that they intend to end the conflict. But
ethnic Albanian political leaders have rejected the council as a
``body formed by Serbian authorities,'' not one that would be part
of Kosovo self-rule.
	   The 18-member council appointed by the Serbian parliament last
week includes both Serbs and ethnic Albanians. It is to address
local issues in Kosovo, where Yugoslavia began a crackdown in
February on independence-seeking ethnic Albanians.
	   ``Our task is to normalize conditions as soon as possible and
create conditions for local elections in Kosovo,'' Zoran
Andjelkovic, who heads the council, said at its opening session
Saturday. ``I hope we will not last for a very long time, because
that means we will be successful.''

New government may support speed limits, Greens say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ A new center-left government of Social
Democrats and environmentalist Greens may support setting a speed
limit on Germany's autobahns, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The Koelner Zeitung quoted the Greens' transport expert, Gila
Altmann, as saying that the future coalition partners' position on
speed limits was ``very close.''
	   The Social Democrats, which won last week's national elections,
opened talks Friday aimed at forming a coalition with the small
Greens party. On the first day, they set combating unemployment,
particularly in eastern Germany, as a priority. The sides hope to
complete talks by Oct. 17.
	   More contentious issues remain ahead, including the Greens' call
for scrapping nuclear energy, raising the tax on gasoline and
halting work on a high-speed magnetic levitation train.
	   A prominent Social Democrat has warned his party against raising
taxes on gasoline, proposed by the Greens to discourage driving,
compensate for promised tax cuts and help finance social welfare
programs. Such increases should be approved Europe-wide, the
Berliner Zeitung quotes Wolfgang Clement as saying in its Sunday
edition.
	   On the speed-limit issue, Altmann said the Greens were prepared
to compromise on the party platform calling for a 100-kilometer
(60-mile) an hour speed limit on the autobahn.
	   ``It's not important whether signs say 100 or 120 kilometers (60
or 75 miles),'' the Koelner Zeitung quoted her as saying.
	   Altmann said the talks could reach agreement on a highway speed
limit of 120-130 kilometer (75-80 miles) an hour, as well as
decreasing the 50-kilometer-an-hour (30-mile-an-hour) limit in
cities to 30 kilometers (20 miles) an hour.

Beazley part of Labor's political dynasty; now he is one of its
</HEADLINE>
heros &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Kim Beazley was born into the Labor
Party but was thrust into its leadership. On Saturday, he was
elevated to its pantheon of heros.
	   In the wake of the disastrous 1996 election, which routed Labor
under despised Prime Minister Paul Keating, the party turned to
Beazley to help it rebuild and reclaim support from traditional
supporters who threw their support behind John Howard's bid for
government.
	   Despite being Keating's deputy in the year before the last
election, Beazley was considered a uniting force and a man who
could calm the often bitter factional rivalries within the Labor
Party.
	   He was elected unopposed as Labor leader when Keating stood down
and immediately set about the task of rebuilding a party shattered
by the size of its electoral defeat.
	   With Labor needing to win 27 seats to win government this year,
Beazley said it was assured of gaining 17 seats, exceeding his own
expectation of picking up only 15 seats.
	   It was not enough to oust the conservatives, but the crowd
hailed Beazley as if he was a conquering hero. He is certainly well
positioned to lead the party to a possible victory in the next
election.
	   Kim Christian Beazley, 49, has an impeccable Labor pedigree and
has been through a comprehensive political apprenticeship.
	   His father, Kim Beazley Sr., was a longstanding member of
Parliament from Western Australia who achieved his highest position
as a Cabinet minister in Gough Whitlam's 1972-75 Labor government.
	   The young Kim had early experience of the rigors of politics,
especially for a politician from Western Australia.
	   He made his first long-haul plane trip to Canberra with his
father when he was only a year old and has repeated the arduous
journey ever since.
	   He cut his teeth in student politics and through a range of
positions within the Western Australian state Labor Party.
	   After receiving a masters degree at the University of Western
Australia, he was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford,
as had Bob Hawke, who became a Labor prime minister in the 1980s.
	   Beazley entered Parliament in 1980 after a brief career as a
university lecturer.
	   He was promoted to the ministry after Labor's 1983 election
victory, taking on the relatively minor portfolios of special
minister of State, Aviation, and minister assisting the minister
for Defense.
	   He was promoted to Cabinet the following year as Defense
minister -- a job he relished and which partly fulfilled his
youthful dream of joining the Navy. He acquired the nickname,
``Bomber Beazley.''
	   Beazley became government leader in the House of Representatives
in 1988, a job he held until Labor lost in 1996.
	   After stints in Transport and Communications and Employment and
Education, Beazley moved into the key economic ministry of Finance
and was elevated to the deputy leadership under Keating in June
1995.
	   In 1989, Beazley and his first wife Mary divorced.
	   The following year he married television producer Susie Annus.

Critic says NYU medal to Venezuelan president came with a price
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ New York University gave Venezuelan
President Rafael Caldera a medal of honor, but at least one critic
says it came with a big price tag at a time when the impoverished
South American country faces worsening economic troubles.
	   Caldera, 82, who is serving his second term, received the medal
last week in New York during a ceremony at which university
officials announced the creation of the Andres Bello chair in honor
of the 19th century Venezuelan educator.
	   El Nacional columnist Alfredo Pena reported Friday that CITGO,
the U.S.-based subsidiary of the state oil monopoly Petroleos de
Venezuela, donated dlrs 2 million to help establish the chair.
	   ``What an expensive medal!'' Pena wrote, noting that Venezuela
lacks the money to pay its own professors decent wages.
	   Venezuelan government spokesman Fernando Egana denied that the
medal was given in exchange for the tax deductible donation.
	   In a letter published Saturday in El Nacional, Egana said the
president, one of the founding fathers of Venezuelan democracy, was
honored for his achievements and that many other prominent
universities have recognized him as well.
	   In another letter, NYU officials said the simultaneous
announcement of the two events was a coincidence, and that the
Andres Bello chair had been proposed years ago.
	   The chair will allow Venezuelan and Latin American professors to
teach and conduct research, and will also provide scholarships for
Venezuelan graduate students, Egana said.
	   Prices for Venezuelan oil dropped to a 12-year low in June,
forcing officials to slash this year's budget. More than half the
population lives in poverty.

Primakov vows to continue privatization, seeks foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov promised Saturday
to continue privatizing state property and appealed for more
long-term foreign investment to help Russia get out of its economic
mess.
	   Russian media have widely reported that the government's plan to
overcome the financial crisis includes rolling back many
free-market reforms and restoring elements of the Soviet-era
command economy.
	   ``Any ravings that are disseminated by the mass media that the
government allegedly is following the course toward a ban on the
dollar's circulation, toward nationalization, winding up
privatization, absolutely do not correspond to reality,'' Primakov
said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Primakov was speaking to Western business people who are members
of his advisory committee on foreign investment in Russia. He
appealed to them for more investment, especially direct, long-term
investment.
	   ``Many of our troubles had emerged because foreign capital would
come to us as portfolio investments and for the short term,'' he
said. ``Investors put in the money and then rapidly moved out their
profit. This setup did not meet the interests either of the
government or real investors.''
	   Primakov reiterated to the business people that the government
had no plans to ban the circulation of U.S. dollars and other
foreign currencies. But he said the government would take steps to
staunch the ``dollar drain,'' the flow of dollars out of Russia.
	   The Central Bank said Friday that Russian companies stashed dlrs
2.5 billion outside the country in September alone. Central Bank
chairman Viktor Gerashchenko noted the best weapon against capital
flight is attractive investment conditions at home.
	   Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov were in
Washington on Saturday for the annual meeting of the International
Monetary Fund, where they plan to spell out the measures Russia is
taking to bail out its finance system.
	   Russia wants the IMF to release the second dlrs 4.3 billion
installment of a loan that was approved in July, a month before the
country's economy crashed and the government effectively defaulted
on its foreign loans.
	   IMF officials have said they want the Russian government to come
up with a sound economic program before the installment is given.
They have made it clear that they disapprove of currency controls
and boosting the money supply by printing rubles _ a favorite tool
of Gerashchenko's when he headed the Soviet Union's central bank.

Italian Communist wants to yank support from Prodi coalition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Communist saying he thought Bertinotti's
followers would win out; decision expected Sunday &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's Communist leader on Saturday called on his
followers to yank support for Premier Romano Prodi's coalition,
which could bring down the government.
	   Deputy Premier Walter Veltroni said that the government was
prepared to turn to Parliament for a vote on whether it still had a
majority backing.
	   ``It's nothing new. It's what we were expecting,'' Veltroni
said, when asked about Fausto Bertinotti's proposal to yank
support.
	   Bertinotti's call to other top leaders of his Communist
Refoundation Party also risks splitting the hardliners. The party's
No. 2, Armando Cossutta, immediately appealed for the party's
continued support of the nearly 2 1-2 year old center-left
government.
	   Refoundation's central committee of directors was meeting over
the weekend in Rome to decide whether to keep backing the
government.
	   A decision was expected to be reached Sunday, but on Saturday
afternoon, a Cossutta backer bitterly indicated Bertinotti's line
would win out.
	   ``The political fact of the day is that today there's a majority
made up of him (Bertinotti) and some Trotskyists who want a
(government) crisis and who practically have started one,'' said
Oliviero Deliberto, in a reference to Leon Trotsky, the Russian
Communist revolutionary.

Turkish ambassador to Italy returns home over Kurdish crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's ambassador to Rome arrived in
Turkey on Saturday for consultations about a diplomatic crisis with
Italy over Kurdish dissidents.
	   Turkey recalled Inal Batu on Thursday after it strongly
protested a meeting of so-called Turkish Kurds' parliament-in-exile
inside Italy's parliament building earlier this week.
	   Turkey says the group is a political front for Kurdish rebels,
waging a guerrilla war for autonomy in Turkey's southeast.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said the Kurds had been
invited by a group of Italian lawmakers and not the government.
	   Turkey has lodged similar protests to several European countries
which have hosted meetings of the parliament-in-exile.

South African leader backtracks on Lesotho announcement; soldier
</HEADLINE>
buried &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's
office backtracked Saturday on his declaration that the government
in neighboring Lesotho would remain in power until new elections
are held.
	   Mbeki, whose government dispatched troops to Lesotho on Sept. 22
to quell an army mutiny and restore order, announced on TV Friday
night that all parties had agreed to hold new elections in 15 to 18
months and had also agreed the ruling party would continue
governing until then.
	   Opposition parties in the Belgium-sized kingdom decried the
announcement _ which came after a day of talks between Lesotho's
ruling and opposition parties _ as premature. The talks were
mediated by officials from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana and
Mozambique.
	   Mbeki had prerecorded his announcement, apparently having
expected those attending the meeting would agree the ruling party
would remain in power. No such agreement was made.
	   Nevertheless, Mbeki's announcement was broadcast, which was ``an
honest mistake,'' his office said in a statement.
	   Mbeki's office said further discussions Monday would address
whether Lesotho's ruling party should govern until new elections
are held.
	   Opposition parties welcomed what they called the ``tentative
decision'' to hold new elections within 18 months. The opposition
has claimed general elections last May, which the ruling Lesotho
Congress for Democracy won by a landslide, were rigged.
	   Meanwhile, one of the South African soldiers killed in the
intervention was buried Saturday as Defense Minister Joe Modise
looked on.
	   Paratrooper Albert Tlale Mangoegape, 24, was carried to his
grave in a coffin draped in the South African flag and with a beret
perched on top.
	   His colleagues and family saluted the casket before it was
lowered into the grave in his hometown of Thaba Nchu, 375
kilometers (230 miles) south of Johannesburg.
	   Modise said Mangoegape's actions had helped ``rescue Lesotho
from mutiny and anarchy.''
	   But, like Mbeki's premature announcement, the whole Lesotho
operation has been marked by mistakes.
	   Instead of announcing they were coming on a peacekeeping
mission, South African troops acting on behalf of the Southern
African Development Community _ they were later joined by Botswanan
troops _ arrived without prior notice. They immediately engaged in
combat with Lesotho soldiers _ both mutineers and loyalists alike,
who thought they were being invaded.
	   Intervention force troops reportedly lacked directions to the
royal palace in Lesotho's capital Maseru, which had been the scene
of protests against the May elections, and didn't have other basic
intelligence.
	   The intervention also sparked a wave of looting and arson
attacks that left much of Maseru in ashes.
	   At a infantry symposium this week, some army commanders
criticized the handling of South Africa's first military
intervention since the country shed apartheid in 1994. Armed forces
commander Gen. Siphiwe Nyanda responded by threatening to reprimand
officers who publicly criticized the operation.
	   The Saturday Star, a Johannesburg weekly, said rather than
seeking to punish those who complain, the operation's defects
should be examined.
	   ``There are many lessons, both diplomatic and military, to be
learnt from the Lesotho debacle,'' the newspaper said in its lead
editorial Saturday. ``Let us seize this opportunity and ensure that
the blunders are not repeated.''
	   Dozens of people died in the operation.
	   Refuting claims that 58 of its soldiers died, the Lesotho
Defense Force asserted Friday that 18 were killed. Nine South
African soldiers also died, according to official figures, although
officers during the clashes had slightly higher figures.

Beazley, part of Labor's dynasty, now one of its heroes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Kim Beazley was born into the Labor
Party and thrust into its leadership. On Saturday, he was elevated
to its pantheon.
	   In the wake of the disastrous 1996 election, which routed Labor
under despised Prime Minister Paul Keating, the party turned to
Beazley to help it rebuild and reclaim traditional supporters who
threw themselves behind John Howard's bid for government.
	   Though he had been Keating's deputy in the year before that
election, Beazley was considered a uniting force who could calm the
often bitter rivalries within the party.
	   He was elected Labor leader unopposed when Keating stood down
and immediately set about the task of rebuilding.
	   In Saturday's voting, the main opposition Labor Party cut deep
into Howard's parliamentary majority, though not enough to win
government.
	   Still, the cheering crowd Beazley stood before in his West
Australian district of Brand, south of Perth, hailed him as a
conquering hero.
	   Kim Christian Beazley, 49, has an impeccable Labor pedigree and
served a a comprehensive political apprenticeship.
	   His father, Kim Beazley Sr., was a longstanding member of
Parliament from Western Australia who achieved his highest position
as Cabinet minister in Gough Whitlam's 1972-75 Labor government.
	   The younger Beazley cut his teeth in student politics and a
range of positions in the Western Australian state Labor Party.
	   After receiving a masters degree at the University of Western
Australia, he was awarded a Rhodes scholarship to study at Oxford,
then entered Parliament in 1980 after a brief career as a
university lecturer.
	   He was promoted to the ministry after Labor's 1983 election
victory, taking on the relatively minor portfolios of special
minister of state, aviation, and minister assisting the minister
for defense.
	   He was promoted to Cabinet the following year as defense
minister, a job he relished and which partly fulfilled his youthful
dream of joining the navy. He acquired the nickname ``Bomber
Beazley.''
	   Beazley became government leader in the House of Representatives
in 1988, a job he held until Labor lost in 1996.
	   After stints in Transport and Communications and Employment and
Education, Beazley moved into the key economic ministry of Finance
and was elevated to the deputy leadership under Keating in June
1995.
	   Beazley and his wife Mary divorced in 1989. The following year
he married television producer Susie Annus.

U.N. conference on health opens in Beirut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A U.N. health conference opened Saturday
to discuss problems of eastern Mediterranean nations, including the
paucity of locally produced vaccines and medicines.
	   A U.N. statement said the four-day conference will also discuss
emerging diseases, especially malaria, prevention and control of
cardiovascular diseases and AIDS and improving nursing and
midwifery services.
	   The meeting is organized by the World Health Organization's
Regional Committee for Eastern Mediterranean. The committee is the
U.N. body's governing arm for countries stretching from Morocco to
Pakistan. It includes one representative of each member state,
usually the health minister.
	   Addressing the conference, President Elias Hrawi said Lebanon is
pursuing a ``national strategy'' to ensure health care for all
citizens. He did not elaborate.
	   Like other countries in the group, Lebanon also lacks
self-sufficiency in the production of medicines, relying heavily on
expensive imported drugs.
	   Others who attended the opening of the conference were
Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, Cabinet ministers, WHO
Director-General Gro Harlem Bruntland and health ministers from
some member states.

John Howard, radical social conservative, takes power again in
</HEADLINE>
Australia &QL; 
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ John Howard once described himself as
``the most radical leader'' Australia's highly conservative Liberal
party has ever had.
	   An advocate of a floating currency and financial market
deregulation long before either idea was fashionable in his party,
Howard took what even he acknowledged was the biggest risk of his
career just weeks before calling Saturday's national elections.
	   He proposed a comprehensive overhaul of the tax system,
including the introduction of a new tax on all goods and services,
which voters rejected outright in 1993.
	   A new tax is hardly the stuff of which electoral dreams are
made, but Howard, who many observers say works best under pressure,
made the tax plan the centerpiece of his re-election campaign, and
won.
	   Claiming victory on Saturday after scraping back to power with a
reduced majority in Parliament, Howard made a virtue of the risk.
	   ``This is probably the first time in the recent experience of
Western political parties that a party has successfully won an
election championing such a major reform,'' Howard said.
	   ``I am immensely proud of the fact that the coalition stuck to
its guns. We stared down (an opposition) fear campaign and the
Australian people came with us.''
	   Howard is also a social conservative. In his victory speech, he
declared himself a champion of traditional family values. His
vision of the Australian family is one like his own, with wife
Janette at home caring for the children, Melanie, Richard and Tim.
	   The son of a suburban gas station owner, Howard practiced law
before he entered Parliament in 1974. A sports fan, he particularly
likes watching cricket.
	   Dogged, un-charismatic, Howard, 59, is a two-time leader of the
Liberals. He first attained the leadership in 1985 but was deposed
in 1989 in a coup by rival Andrew Peacock, now ambassador to the
United States.
	   He was asked on the day of the loss if he hoped to return.
``That's Lazarus with a triple bypass,'' he said.
	   But raised again he was. The Liberals returned him to the
leadership following the disastrous 1993 election. The
conservatives lost that ``unloseable'' election on a platform of
tax reform, including a consumption tax, and a period of
instability in the party.
	   Leading the conservatives to a landslide victory in 1996 and
power for the first time in 13 years, Howard moved quickly to
introduce radical changes to industrial relations law and a bill to
restrict Aboriginal native title rights to land.
	   Under Howard, the coalition government turned an Australian dlrs
10 billion (US dlrs 5.9 billion) budget deficit inherited from the
Labor administration into an Australian dlrs 1.2 billion (US dlrs
708 billion) surplus for the 12 months ended June 30, 1998.
	   This won the government points for cocooning Australia from the
worst of the Asian financial crisis.
	   With the global slowdown looming, Howard has promised austere
economic management for his second term.
	   But he also promised income tax cuts worth Australian dlrs 13
billion (US dlrs 7.6 billion) to soften the blow of the new
consumption tax.
	   The income tax cuts are based on the uncertain assumption that
the Australian economy will continue to grow 3.5 percent a year to
keep the budget in surplus.

Lions reduce 'magic' number to four by tying with Nippon Ham
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Seibu Lions reduced their ``magic'' number to
four in the Pacific League pennant race Saturday as they tied the
Nippon Ham Fighters 1-1 in 12 innings.
	   Domingo Martinez, formerly of Triple A Rochester, singled home a
run with two outs in the bottom of the third inning for the Lions.
	   But Fighters' Hiroshi Narahara tied the game with a single in
the sixth before a crowd of 26,000 at Seibu Dome. The two teams
ended at 1-1 after completing 12 extra innings _ the longest
Japanese games are permitted to go.
	   If the Lions win four more games or the second-place Fighters
lose four, the Lions will clinch the pennant.
	   At Kobe, Harvey Jerome Pulliam Jr. hit a game-deciding three-run
homer in the bottom of the seventh, helping the Orix BlueWave to a
6-4 win over the Kintetsu Buffaloes.
	   Pulliam, formerly with the Colorado Rockies, has 16 homers. Phil
Clark, formerly with Boston Red Sox, cracked his 31st home run in
the third for the Buffaloes.
	   At Chiba, Toshiyuki Goto (4-2) threw a four-hitter for host
Chiba Lotte Marines in a 7-1 victory over the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks.
	   In the Central League, Akimitsu Ito went the distance with a
three-hitter as the Yakult Swallows edged the front-running
Yokohama BayStars 2-1 at Yokohama.
	   The BayStars' magic number remained unchanged at 3 as the
second-place Chunichi Dragons beat the Hanshin Tigers 2-1. Yokohama
needs to win just three games of its remaining nine to clinch its
first pennant since 1960.
	   Kenichi Kawakami allowed four hits over seven innings and Sun
Dong-yol gave up no hits in the remaining two innings to cement the
Dragons' victory, snapping the Yokohama's winning streak at three.
	   At Tokyo Dome, Hideki Matsui smashed a three-run home run in the
bottom of the second inning, contributing to the Yomiuri Giants'
7-4 romp over the Hiroshima Yoto Carp.
	   Matsui leads the league with 34 home runs, bringing his RBIs to
100. Masumi Kuwata allowed 8 hits over 7 innings and picked up a
win. Kuwata now is the top hurler in the league with 16 victories.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russian, Chechen government comment. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A body found near the Chechen border has been
identified as a Russian government official who was kidnapped
earlier in the week, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Saturday.
	   The body was that of Akmal Saidov, a bureaucrat at the Russian
government mission in the separatist republic, the head of
Chechnya's anti-abduction squad, Ruslan Tabuyev, told ITAR-Tass.
	   Saidov was kidnapped after attending a public rally Tuesday in
the Chechen capital Grozny.
	   A preliminary examination of the body, found Friday night just
outside the the city of Sleptsovsk, showed that he had been
tortured and strangled, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   It said there was a note attached to the body warning against
cooperating with Russia's Federal Security Service. The service
denied that Saidov was a secret agent and said allegations that he
worked for it were ``a pure invention.''
	   The Chechen Foreign Ministry said the killing of Saidov was ``a
political provocation aimed at complicating Russian-Chechen
relations,'' ITAR-Tass said.
	   Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov urged Chechen
authorities to do everything possible to guarantee the security of
Russian officials in Chechnya and to find those responsible for
killing Saidov.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's personal envoy to Chechnya, Valentin
Vlasov, was kidnapped five months ago and remains missing.
	   Hundreds of Russian and foreign citizens have been abducted by
gangs seeking ransom since the 1994-96 independence war with
Russia, and dozens remain held.

Malaysia's PM hosts grand Commonwealth Games dinner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
threw a massive dinner late Saturday for several thousand
volunteers who helped in organizing the Commonwealth Games.
	   ``We've succeeded in doing everything,'' an exultant Mahathir
told the smaller-than-expected crowd of 7,000 who turned out for
the 2-million-ringgit (dlrs 526,000) dinner at the glittering Bukit
Jalil Stadium, the main venue for the 10-day games that ended Sept.
21.
	   ``We've succeeded in building the most beautiful stadium in the
world,'' he said. ``We also triumphed in building the biggest
stadium in the region. We did this to safeguard the pride of our
nation.''
	   Although recent political developments, including the arrest of
ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, detracted from the
success of the games, Mahathir has insisted on celebrating.
	   Despite street protests and demonstrations demanding the prime
minister's resignation, he declared a holiday on Sept. 28 in honor
of the national squad's 10 gold, 14 silver and 12 bronze medals.
	   Malaysia stood fourth in the overall medal tally.
	   Mahathir said that foreigners wanted the games to fail ``because
they doubted Malaysia's ability'' to host a sports event of this
magnitude.
	   ``Now they've to acknowledge that our preparations are world
standard. They'll have to say that Malaysia can!'' he said, shortly
before presenting prizes worth 2.2 million ringgit (dlrs 580,000)
to the medal winners.
	   The stadium's klieg lights bathing the 72-year old prime
minister seemed a far cry from the political turmoil gripping the
Southeast Asian nation.

Serbs say they will 'normalize' Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In the latest move by Serbian
authorities to dodge NATO airstrikes, a Serb-appointed council
meant to serve as an interim government in Kosovo announced
Saturday it will try to ``normalize conditions'' in the rebellious
province.
	   The declaration, part of a last-ditch effort to show that the
Serbs intend to end the conflict, came just two days before a
report by United Nations chief Kofi Annan on whether Belgrade is
complying with demands to halt its assault on ethnic Albanians. If
not, Washington has indicated NATO airstrikes will happen within
two weeks.
	   But like other moves in recent days _ a mass pullback of troops
and equipment in Kosovo as well as a series of diplomatic efforts _
the latest drew skepticism. Ethnic Albanian political leaders have
rejected the council as a ``body formed by Serbian authorities,''
not one that would be part of Kosovo self-rule.
	   The council, appointed by the Serbian parliament last week,
includes the Serbian prime minister and 17 other members, including
Serbs and ethnic Albanians. It is to address local issues in
Kosovo, where Yugoslavia began a crackdown in February on
independence-seeking ethnic Albanians.
	   ``Our task is to normalize conditions as soon as possible and
create conditions for local elections in Kosovo,'' Zoran
Andjelkovic, who heads the council, said at the body's opening
session Saturday. ``I hope we will not last for a very long time,
because that means we will be successful.''
	   Edita Tahiri, a top ethnic Albanian political leader, condemned
the establishment of the council as ``strengthening Serbian rule in
Kosovo.''
	   ``The act ... is a serious impediment for any success in a
negotiating process,'' she said.
	   The Serbs' efforts to eliminate the separatist Kosovo Liberation
Army in the Serbian province, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian,
has killed hundreds of people and driven an estimated 275,000 from
their homes. Momentum for international leaders to step in has
increased in the past week amid revelations of massacres of ethnic
Albanian civilians in the forests of Kosovo.
	   After a session of the Yugoslav government in Belgrade on
Friday, officials issued a statement saying the fighting had ended
and blaming continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   But while the province was reported mostly quiet, there are
continuing scattered reports of gunfire exchanges between Serb
forces and ethnic Albanian militants. The Serbs' Media Center
reported Saturday that a Yugoslav army vehicle came under attack
some 20 kilometers (12 miles) southwest of Pristina late Friday. No
one was injured.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders have rebuffed a Serb offer to
hold talks, saying Friday that they won't sit down until NATO
intervenes. Low-level talks, which the Serbs say could lead to
restoration of some of the autonomy they took away from Kosovo in
1989, broke off in May.
	   The Serbs also on Friday invited Annan to visit Kosovo, removed
a key police roadblock and showed reporters heavy equipment they
said had been withdrawn.
	   Showing the West is unconvinced, German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Saturday that ``the clock is
at one minute to 12'' regarding NATO intervention. Kinkel stressed
that ``no ultimatum, no date has been set,'' but added: ``Mr.
Milosevic must know that we are serious.''
	   Greece, meanwhile, added its voice to those against airstrikes.
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said Western powers have blown
the Kosovo crisis out of all proportion, and predicted that the
price of any NATO strikes on Serbia will be paid by neighboring
countries in the Balkans.
	   Russia, a staunch Serb ally, also adamantly opposes any military
intervention in Serbia.

Skiing great, Alberto Tomba, officially calls it quits

	   ROME (AP) _ Alberto Tomba, whose five Olympic medals, off-slope
antics and flamboyant ways made him Italy's most famous skier of
all times, on Saturday officially called it quits.
	   Tomba, known as ``La Bomba,'' (the bomb) for his explosive
skiing style, had hinted at retirement for years, but always burst
back on the scene to stun his rivals and savor another victory.
	   Now, 10 years after he captured the hearts of thousands of fans
at the Calgary Olympics with double gold medals, his ``ciao'' is
for good.
	   In a statement released through the Italian news agency ANSA,
Tomba, 31, said he had ``thought a lot'' before making his
decision, and he thanked all those who ``followed my career and
urged me on to win.''
	   The Italian's departure will leave a gaping hole in the ski
scene where few athletes have ever attained his celebrity status or
attracted such a huge following.
	   ``It is a huge loss for the Italian Ski Federation and for
international sport,'' said Gustavo Thoeni, a former ski great and
Tomba's ex-coach.``After such a long career and so many victories
it is only natural that Tomba no longer has the motivation to keep
racing.''
	   From the start, Tomba captured just as many headlines for his
fun and crazy ways on and off the slopes as for his skiing talent.
	   He once competed in a World Cup slalom wearing only a pair of
tight, yellow shorts and a start bib. He has posed in his underwear
for television advertisements. And his many girlfriends included a
former Miss Italy, whom he dumped when she appeared semi-nude in a
magazine photo during one of the ski season's most important races.
	   Better known as someone with natural talent rather than as a
workhorse, Tomba has been frequently spotted at discos or celebrity
outings.
	   Unlike most other Italian skiers who grew up in the country's
northern Alps, Tomba is a native of the central city of Bologna.
	   As a skier, Tomba first landed in the spotlight at the 1987
World Championships in Crans Montana, Switzerland, where, at age
20, he clinched the bronze.
	   He went on to claim both the slalom and giant slalom at the 1988
Calgary Olympics, earning a red Ferrari from his father.
	   Tomba next won a gold and silver at the 1992 Albertville Games
and then a silver in Lillehammer in 1994. At the 1996 World
Championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain, Tomba again stole the show,
claiming the giant slalom and slalom titles.
	   His string of accomplishments include the overall World Cup
title, considered a next-to-impossible feat for someone who
competes in only two of the four ski disciplines.
	   After a mediocre last season, during which he did not finish
either the slalom or giant slalom at the Nagano Olympics, Tomba
again stunned his rivals in the final World Cup race by clinching
his 50th career win.
	   He celebrated the victory in his usual style: pumped up by
hundreds of cheering fans, he hurled his skis, poles and gloves
into the crowd. Then he tore off his clothing, layer by layer,
ending with just a sleeveless blue undershirt and the bottom half
of his race suit.
	   ``These years have been full of emotions and joy but also of a
lot of tension,'' the star's mother, Maria Grazia Tomba, said
Saturday.
	   In his statement, Tomba did not say what he would do next, but
he has frequently expressed the desire to get involved in the movie
business. He is working on a two-part film for Italian TV in which
he plays an officer for the Carabinieri, the same paramilitary
police force in which Tomba served as an alternate to military
service.
	   He might also have to deal with charges of tax fraud. In July, a
prosecutor asked that Tomba and his parents be indicted for
allegedly hiding about dlrs 12 million in earnings from 1990-96
from tax authorities.
	   Tomba promised his many disappointed fans a special good-bye
message on his Internet site: www.alberto.tomba.it.

Turkish military launches new incursion into northern Iraq

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with comments from premier, intelligence official,
clash inside Turkey, ADDS details, byline &QL;

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Some 10,000 Turkish soldiers have crossed
into northern Iraq to attack Turkish Kurdish rebels, and Turkey
indicated it might move into Syria to do the same, news reports
said Saturday.
	   The troops crossed into Iraq on Friday following two days of
bombings by Turkish jets of suspected rebel bases in areas which
extend all along the raqi-Turkish border until Iran.
	   The military did not return calls for comment.
	   The rebels, fighting for an autonomy in southeastern Turkey,
stage hit-and-run attacks from bases in Syria, Iraq and Iran.
	   On Friday Turkey strongly warned Syria that its ``patience was
running out,'' and Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was quoted Saturday
by the daily Hurriyet as saying, ``the soldier is awaiting an
order.''
	   But an intelligence official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said on Saturday that the troop deployments were not
targeting Syria, but infiltrations of Kurdish rebels.
	   Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, chief of the general staff, has
described the mounting tension with Syria as ``an undeclared war''
amid unconfirmed reports of troop deployments along the
Turkish-Syrian border by both sides.
	   According to daily Cumhuriyet on Saturday, the military has
reinforced its units near the border town of Reyhanli, with an
artillery, an engineer and an infantry battalions.
	   On Saturday, Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said Turkey would
soon carry out an exercise near the Syrian border, private NTV
television reported.
	   Turkey has never conducted wargames along the Syrian border. The
exercise was expected to follow current NATO maneuvers, running in
an area close to Syria through Oct. 21.
	   In a show of force, Turkish jets buzzed along the Syrian border
on Friday, daily Radikal reported Saturday.
	   Hurriyet newspaper said the Turkish units also sealed the escape
routes of the rebels along the Syrian-Iraqi border inside northern
Iraq.
	   Sezgin said Turkey was still trying to use diplomatic means to
solve the problem. ``But there is a limit of patience,'' NTV quoted
him as saying. ``Then we will do whatever necessary.''
	   Damascus denied the allegations and accused Turkey of plotting
with Israel to create a crisis with the aim of undermining Syria.
	   Turkey often crosses into Iraq to wipe out rebel forces in the
area which have been enjoying a free-for-all are because of an
internal power conflict between two Iraqi Kurdish factions.
	   The current cross-border offensive is apparently aimed at
dealing the rebels a heavy blow before winter sets in and movement
becomes difficult.
	   Both Iraqi groups committed themselves to fight the Turkish
Kurdish rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party, in a power-sharing
agreement in Washington on Sept. 17 and will reportedly help the
Turkish army, Radikal said.
	   The military also intensified its crackdown on the rebels in
Turkey's southeast, killing 15 guerrillas on Saturday, the Anatolia
news agency said.
	   The Turkish-Kurdish war has killed more than 37,000 people since
1984.

Taliban seek U.N. intervention, warns of 'devastating' war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Warning of a ''devastating'' war with
neighboring Iran, the Taliban religious army on Saturday wrote a
letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan seeking his
intervention.
	   ''The foreign ministry ... requests your excellency once again
to use your influence and authority for the amicable solution of
the differences,'' the letter said.
	   Without this solution, ''the entire region will become engulfed
by a devastating war.''
	   The Taliban's foreign ministry said the letter follows the
incursion of Iranian fighter jets and helicopters into Afghan air
space on Friday. The Taliban also threatened to retaliate if
further incursions occur, said its foreign ministry in Kabul.
	   The Iranian Embassy in neighboring Pakistan denied the Taliban
claims, calling them ''false and baseless.''
	   Iran has amassed 270,000 soldiers on its border with Afghanistan
and has been conducting massive military maneuvers in the region,
rolling hundreds of tanks toward the Afghan border and bombing mock
targets nearby.
	   The huge deployment of Iranian soldiers was Tehran's response to
the killing in August of eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian
journalist in Afghanistan's Mazar-e-Sharif. The Iranians were
killed by invading Taliban soldiers.
	   The Taliban also arrested about 60 Iranian citizens and
transferred them to jails in the province of Kandahar. Ten of the
60 have since been released.
	   Iran has demanded an apology, the release of the Iranian
captives and the arrest and deportation of the men who killed its
diplomats.
	   The Taliban has refused all the requests and called the slain
diplomats ''conspirators.''
	   The Taliban has accused Iran of supporting its northern-based
opponents with money and weapons. The opposition, a collection of
small groups representing the country's minority ethnic and
religious groups, also includes Afghanistan's minority Shiite
Muslims.
	   Most Iranians are Shiite Muslims, while most Afghans are Sunni
Muslims like the Taliban army, which is also dominated by the
majority ethnic Pashtun tribe.
	   Both the anti-Taliban alliance and Iran say Pakistan is
supporting the Taliban. Pakistan routinely denies it.
	   In a statement issued by Iran's embassy in the Pakistani capital
of Islamabad, Tehran urged ''governments supporting the (Taliban)
militia'' to use their influence to negotiate the release of its
citizens.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two-thirds of Russians surveyed do not think that
U.S. President Bill Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky is
grounds for impeachment.
	   The All-Russian Center for Studying Public Opinion surveyed
1,714 Russians from Sept. 25-29, the Interfax news agency said.
	   It found that 66 percent did not think Clinton should be
impeached, eight percent thought he should resign or be impeached,
and the rest were undecided, Interfax said.

Egypt: Syria-Turkey row has no place in volatile Middle East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt on Saturday urged Syria and Turkey to
peacefully resolve their burgeoning dispute over Turkish rebels,
saying the Middle East cannot ``endure additional tension.''
	   President Hosni Mubarak called Syrian President Hafez Assad to
convey his apprehension about the rising military friction along
the Syrian-Turkish border, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said.
	   He said he also conveyed Mubarak's message for Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel through Turkey's ambassador, Yaser Yakis, to
Egypt. Mubarak also will call Demirel on Sunday, Moussa said.
	   He did not give details of Mubarak's conversation with Assad or
the contents of the message to Demirel.
	   Turkey accuses Syria of supporting Turkish Kurdish rebels, and
has reportedly been massing troops and armored vehicles along its
border with Syria. Syria denies sheltering the rebels
	   On Friday, Turkey warned that ``its patience is running out''
and Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said Saturday that Turkey would
soon carry out a military exercise near the Syrian border.
	   Moussa said he told Ambassador Yakis of Turkey that ``the
situation in the Middle East cannot endure additional tension,
particularly if it is unnecessary and there are political and
diplomatic means to resolve it.''
	   Turkey says the Kurdish rebels carry out cross-border attacks
from bases in Syria, Iraq and Iran. It also claims the rebels'
headquarters are based in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of
Lebanon and that their leader, Abdullah Ocalan, lives in the Syrian
capital Damascus.
	   For its part, Syria accuses Ankara of forming a military
alliance with Israel that threatens the security of Arab countries.
	   Moussa spoke to reporters before leaving Cairo with Mubarak on a
one-day visit to Saudi Arabia. Mubarak is scheduled to meet with
Saudi King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah for talks on ``the
situation in the region,'' Moussa said. He did not elaborate.

Treading cautiously, France suspends mass inoculations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Faced with fears of a potential public health
disaster, France has suspended systematic vaccinations of school
children against Hepatitis B, four years after starting the mass
immunization program.
	   The World Health Program expressed fears the French decision
would undermine its own campaign -- subscribed to by 100 countries
-- to fight Hepatitis B.
	   French Health Minister Bernard Kouchner, in his Thursday
announcement, based the decision to temporarily suspend mass
inoculations on fears the vaccine may be linked to neurological
disorders, in particular multiple sclerosis.
	   Since 1994, 11-year-old French school children were
systematically inoculated against Hepatitis B.
	   ``It cannot be excluded that the vaccination might reveal or
facilitate'' the development of central nervous system problems,
Kouchner said, referring to incidents of multiple sclerosis linked
by some to the vaccine.
	   The decision does not affect the vaccination of new-borns and
others by family physicians.
	   Hepatitis, a virus that attacks the liver, is spread through
exchange of bodily fluids.
	   No scientific study has yet shown a cause-and-effect link
between the vaccine and multiple sclerosis. However, the vaccine
has been blamed by some for a small incidence of cases.
	   In June, a Nanterre court ruled there was ``sufficient
certitude'' to conclude a link between an anti-Hepatitis B vaccine
produced by SmithKline Beecham and the startup of multiple
sclerosis symptoms in two people, according to the daily Le Monde.
The court demanded the company pay 130,000 francs (dlrs 23,215).
	   SmithKline Beecham has appealed. A ruling is pending in another
case against French pharmaceutical company Pasteur-Merieux, which
also produces an anti-Hepatitis B vaccine.
	   The World Health Organization, in a statement issued Friday in
Geneva, expressed fears the French decision ``may lead to loss of
public confidence in this vaccine, and decisions by other countries
to suspend or delay the introduction of HB vaccine.''
	   WHO said the vaccine has an ``outstanding record of safety and
efficiency'' against the deadly disease.
	   Kouchner's decision represents a new cautious approach to public
health policy following two scandals in the past decade.
	   France's national health system suffered a blow when it was
revealed that in the mid-1980s hemophiliacs had knowingly been
given blood products tainted with the AIDS virus. A former prime
minister, Laurent Fabius, and two other ministers are to stand
trial for their roles in the scandal that left more than 500 people
dead.
	   Last year, authorities were placed under investigation for
distributing potentially tainted growth hormones that may have
killed up to 40 children afflicted with dwarfism in the mid-1980s.
	   In January, Kouchner acknowledged that 175,000 schoolchildren
had been injected with a too-strong dose of Hepatitis B vaccine in
1995 that caused adverse reactions, like vomiting and fainting, for
some children.

US advises its citizens to leave and stay away from Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.S. Department of State has
issued a travel warning to U.S. citizens advising them to stay away
or leave Serbia and Montenegro, the two Yugoslav republics that may
soon be targeted by NATO.
	   ``The Department of State warns US citizens against travel to
Serbia-Montenegro and ... to depart the country,'' if there, said
the document dated Friday and cited in a release signed by the top
U.S. diplomat in Belgrade, Richard Miles.
	   The release, faxed to The Associated Press in Belgrade, also
said that non-essential personnel in the U.S. embassy and all
family members to leave were authorized to leave.
	   An embassy source, speaking on condition on anonymity, said
there were no plans for an organized evacuation, a precaution
applied here in 1994 when NATO targeted Bosnian Serbs.
	   ``Due to the failure of Belgrade authorities to comply with the
United Nations Security Council demands ... members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization have taken steps that could lead to
military interventions,'' the text read.
	   The latest travel warning superseded a previous one, issued only
a day earlier, which merely urged caution. In case anybody would do
otherwise or even travel to the hotspot, the war-torn Kosovo
province, the advisory said:
	   ``Both the police and (ethnic Albanian) Kosovo Liberation Army
are active and each operates numerous checkpoints throughout the
region. There have been incidents at both kinds of checkpoints. ...
The authority of the individuals operating these checkpoints should
not be challenged.''

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Sudden, unexplained wealth would be
cause for a government investigation if anti-money laundering
legislation now being prepared is approved in this South American
country.
	   Concerned about a spate of drug-related crimes and evidence of
money laundering, authorities are planning a special Cabinet
retreat, presided over by President Janet Jagan, to discuss crime
and security.
	   Government lawyers are also drafting legislation that would lead
to systematic investigations of people who show signs of sudden
wealth, National Security Advisor Roger Luncheon said Saturday.
	   ``Unfortunately, it is only now that dedicated efforts are being
made to the economic aspect of narco-trafficking,'' said Luncheon.
	   Officials have noted that several business people have
constructed four- and five-story concrete buildings around the
capital that are largely unoccupied and unavailable for rental, and
they believe they may be used to launder money.
	   The new legislation will be considered later this month when
Parliament convenes after a recess.

Congolese rebels capture eastern towns, advance on Kindu air base
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels said Saturday they had
captured Ubundu and Kalima on their way to the strategic Kindu air
base and were close to a major junction in the north.
	   Bob Ngoy, a rebel army spokesman, said troops moving south from
Kisangani captured Ubundu, 285 kilometers (178 miles) north of
Kindu, and moving west, took Kalima, 80 kilometers (50 miles) east
of the government air base that is used to bomb rebel-held areas.
	   Kindu is 380 kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel
stronghold.
	   Ngoy also said rebel forces were within 12 kilometers (7 miles)
of Buta, 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of Kisangani on the main
road in northern Congo that links Sudan and the Central African
Republic.
	   Sudan has reportedly sent troops to bolster President Laurent
Kabila's efforts to crush the two-month rebellion. CAR President
Felix-Ange Patasse is a strong Kabila supporter.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims.
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's
army and opposition politicians _ have been targeting Kindu since
late August when they were forced to retreat from the outskirts of
the capital, Kinshasa, after troops from Angola and Zimbabwe
intervened on the government side.
	   In Kindu, government soldiers are reportedly reinforced by
Sudanese troops and rebel fighters from Uganda and Rwanda.
	   Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, leader of the rebel Congolese Democratic
Coalition, said a rebel victory at Kindu would confirm rebel
strength.
	   ``It will prove to all those still having doubts that we are
capable of military gains,'' he said.
	   The rebels took up arms Aug. 2, but have been confined to
eastern Congo since their defeat in the west.
	   Wamba said the rebels want direct negotiations with Kabila. But
the president has so far refused, accusing the rebels of being
puppets of Rwanda and Uganda and has vowed to defeat them.

Lonely priests seek modern look
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greece's Orthodox priests say their dress
code of long black robes, pipe hats and overgrown beards is ruining
their marriage prospects, local media reported Saturday.
	   ``If the robes create an obstacle for finding a wife, and you
know they do, then the Church's leadership must do something to
modernize our appearance,'' Father Efstathios Kollas, head of the
union of parish priests, said Friday. Out of Greece's 11,000 odd
priests, only 3,000 are married, he said.
	   Orthodox Greeks must marry before entering the priesthood, while
only single priests can rise above the lower ranks of the clergy.
	   Kollas also argued that priests' outdated appearance discouraged
educated Greeks from becoming men of the cloth.
	   The priests' plea to shed their head-to-foot robes comes ahead
of a meeting of the Holy Synod, the Greek Church's governing body.
The meeting is scheduled for Tuesday and will be presided over by
the head of the Greek Orthodox Church Archbishop Christodoulos. It
is not yet certain whether Kollas' plea will be discussed at the
ten-day meeting.
	   Since his election as church leader in April, Christodoulos has
argued that it is essential to modernize the church, a bastion of
conservatism, without abandoning its age old traditions. In a
surprise move last month, Christodoulos told young men they could
even wear earrings when they visit their pastors
	   Priests in other Orthodox countries have a similar appearance to
those in Greece. More than 90 percent of all Greeks are baptized
Greek Orthodox, which is the country's official religion.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In the latest move by Serbian
authorities to dodge NATO airstrikes, A Serb-appointed council
meant to serve as an interim government in Kosovo announced
Saturday that it will try to ``normalize conditions'' in the
rebellious province.
	   The declaration, part of a last-ditch effort to show that the
Serbs intend to end the conflict, came just two days before a
report by U.N. chief Kofi Annan on whether Belgrade is complying
with demands to halt its assault on ethnic Albanians. If not,
Washington has indicated that NATO airstrikes will come within two
weeks.
	   But like other moves in recent days _ a mass pullback of troops
and equipment in Kosovo as well as a series of diplomatic efforts _
the latest drew skepticism. Ethnic Albanian political leaders have
rejected the council as a ``body formed by Serbian authorities,''
not one that would be part of Kosovo self-rule.
	   The 18-member council appointed by the Serbian parliament last
week includes Serbs and ethnic Albanians. It is to address local
issues in Kosovo, where Yugoslavia began a crackdown in February on
independence-seeking ethnic Albanians.
	   ``Our task is to normalize conditions as soon as possible and
create conditions for local elections in Kosovo,'' Zoran
Andjelkovic, who heads the council, said at its opening session
Saturday. ``I hope we will not last for a very long time, because
that means we will be successful.''
	   Edita Tahiri, a top ethnic Albanian political leader, condemned
the establishment of the council as ``strengthening Serbian rule in
Kosovo.''
	   ``The act ... is a serious impediment for any success in a
negotiating process,'' she said.
	   The Serbian efforts to eliminate the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army in the Serbian province, which is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian, has killed hundreds of people and driven an estimated
275,000 from their homes. Momentum for international leaders to
step in has increased in the past week amid revelations of
massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in the forests of Kosovo.
	   After a session of the Yugoslav government in Belgrade on
Friday, officials issued a statement saying the fighting had ended
and blaming continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   But while the province was reported mostly quiet, there are
continuing scattered reports of gunfire exchanges between Serb
forces and ethnic Albanian militants. The Serbs' Media Center
reported Saturday that a Yugoslav army vehicle came under attack
some 20 kilometers (12 miles) southwest of Pristina late Friday. No
one was injured.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders have rebuffed a Serb offer to
hold talks, saying Friday that they won't sit down until NATO
intervenes. Low-level talks, which the Serbs say could lead to
restoration of some of the autonomy they took away from Kosovo in
1989, broke off in May.
	   The Serbs also invited Annan to visit Kosovo, removed a key
police roadblock and showed reporters heavy equipment they said had
been withdrawn.
	   Showing the West is unconvinced, German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Saturday that ``the clock is
at one minute to 12'' regarding NATO intervention. Kinkel stressed
that ``no ultimatum, no date has been set,'' but added: ``Mr.
Milosevic must know that we are serious.''
	   Greece, meanwhile, added its voice to those against airstrikes.
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said Western powers have blown
the Kosovo crisis out of proportion, and predicted that the price
of any NATO strikes on Serbia will be paid by neighboring countries
in the Balkans.
	   Russia, a staunch Serb ally, also adamantly opposes military
intervention.

Agassi outlasts Kucera in five-set marathon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Andre Agassi saved four match points and
won the last 11 games of the match to beat a tiring Karol Kucera in
five sets and reach the final of the Grand Slam Cup Saturday.
	   Agassi won 7-6 (7-1), 6-7 (5-7), 2-6, 7-5, 6-0 in a match that
lasted three hours and 40 minutes.
	   The American trailed 5-2 in the fourth set and Kucera served for
the match.
	   But the Slovak was unable to convert four match points as his
errors combined with some spectacular and risky shot-making by
Agassi.
	   Kucera sent a forehand into the net to drop the game and Agassi
gained the momentum, winning 11 games in a row to close out the
match.
	   As Kucera began to cramp, Agassi took full advantage of the
opportunity and never let up the pressure, keeping a visibly tiring
Kucera constantly on the move.
	   Kucera was unable to keep with up with Agassi's pace and his
game collapsed.
	   During changeovers, Kucera had his legs massaged by a trainer
and he offered little resistance in the final set.
	   Agassi took some measure of revenge for his five-set loss to
Kucera in the Round of 16 in last month's U.S. Open.
	   The American was a wild-card entry in the tournament that
nominally brings together players with the best records in the four
Grand Slam events of the year _ the Australian, French and U.S.
Open and Wimbledon.
	   After the withdrawal of top-ranked Pete Sampras and No. 2
Patrick Rafter, organizers invited Agassi although his Grand Slam
record this year was not good enough to earn him a direct spot in
the 12-man field.
	   Now, he could end up earning dlrs 1.3 million by winning the
title. The losing men's finalist will get dlrs 650,000.
	   In the second semifinal later Saturday, Mark Philippoussis
played Marcelo Rios.
	   Kucera is enjoying the best year of his career. He was a
semifinalist in the Australian Open after beating Sampras and a
quarterfinalist in the U.S. Open, rising to No. 6 in the rankings.
	   Agassi has won four tournaments on the ATP Tour this year,
although he never got past the Round of 16 at any of the four Grand
Slams.
	   But he has come out of a deep slump during which he had dropped
out of the top 100. A former No. 1, Agassi is now ranked No. 8.
	   He beat the only Grand Slam champion here, Australian Open
winner Petr Korda, in the quarterfinals, remaining the only former
Grand Slam champion in the draw.
	   Agassi has three Grand Slam title, 1992 Wimbledon, 1994 U.S.
Open and 1995 Australian Open.

	   TASOVCICI, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ One Muslim was killed and
three others injured in a series of explosions outside of Muslim
homes in a southern Bosnian village, international officials said
Saturday.
	   The first explosion occurred late Friday, when an unidentified
attacker threw a hand grenade out of a passing car, said Kelly
Moore, spokeswoman for the United Nations in Bosnia.
	   The grenade rolled under a car parked in front of a Muslim-owned
house, where seven Muslims and one Croat were standing. One of the
Muslims was killed when the device exploded and three others were
injured, including 60-year-old Sakir Kudra.
	   ``Had (the bomb) not rolled under the car, more of us would be
dead,'' said Kudra.
	   The victim was identified as Adem Muminagic, 60.
	   Moore said four other attacks on Muslim houses in the village of
Tasovcici, 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Sarajevo, also
occurred late Friday and early Saturday. No one was injured in
these attacks.
	   Chris Riley, a spokesman for Bosnia's top international
official, Carlos Westendorp, said his office ``strongly condemns
the violence'' and holds the local police and political leadership
responsible for the security of all citizens.
	   Some 40 Muslim families have returned in the past few days to
their homes in Tasovcici, in the Croat-dominated region of the
Muslim-Croat Federation, under an agreement between local
officials.
	   Himzo Saric, representative of the Muslims in Tasovcici, said 80
more families are scheduled to return to their homes in the region
by the end of the month. He stressed that the latest attacks would
not prevent their return.
	   Under the 1995 Dayton Peace agreement, Bosnia is divided into
the Serb republic and the Muslim-Croat Federation. Clashes between
the Muslims and the Croats have plagued the federation since its
founding.
	   Also Saturday, Elisabeth Rehn, the head of the United Nations
mission in Bosnia, went to the southwestern city of Mostar Saturday
to meet with local leaders and international officials to discuss
the region's security situation.
	   In a statement released later Saturday, the United Nations
expressed strong concern over the events in Tasovici and empasized
its commitment to returning refugees to their pre-war homes.
	   The U.N. police force has also increased its presence in the
region, the statement said.

	   MARIJA BISTRICA, Croatia (AP) _ Declaring him a martyr of the
faith, Pope John Paul II on Saturday honored Croatia's World War II
cardinal, a hero to Roman Catholics, but long a symbol of divisions
in the Balkans.
	   Half a million od people watched with delight and gratitude as
John Paul beatified Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, elevating him to
the last step before possible sainthood, in Marija Bistrica,
Croatia's leading Marian shrine to the Virgin Mary.
	   John Paul appealed to a country that has suffered from war and
ethnic divisions ``to forgive and reconcile and to purify one's
memory of hatred'' and ``the desire for revenge.''
	   The pope said Stepinac ``having endured in his own body and his
own spirit the atrocities of the communist system is now entrusted
to the memory of his fellow countrymen with the radiant badge of
martyrdom.''
	   Stepinac was hailed as a hero by Catholics for his resistance to
communism and refusal to separate the Croatian church from the
Vatican. But his beatification, the last step before possible
sainthood, is controversial because many Serbs and Jews accuse him
of sympathizing with the Nazis.
	   While serving as Zagreb's archbishop in 1941, Stepinac supported
Croatia's German-backed fascist puppet government led by dictator
Ante Pavelic. By 1942, however, Stepinac denounced the regime's
genocidal policies, which led to the extermination of thousands of
Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croat opponents.
	   He died at 62 in 1960 while under house arrest following his
conviction on charges of collaborating with the Nazis. Stepinac's
own notes and recent studies say he spoke out against the
atrocities, and worked to save lives, but many Serbs still consider
him a war criminal.
	   The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a U.S.-based Nazi-hunting group,
also had asked the Vatican to postpone the beatification pending
further study of the cardinal's actions, although some local Jews
defended Stepinac.
	   John Paul addressed the criticism in his homily, quoting from a
1943 address by the cardinal condemning injustices and the killing
of innocents. He said Stepinac's figure summed up ``the whole
tragedy which befell the Croatian people and Europe in the course
of this century marked by the three great evils of fascism,
national socialism and communism.''
	   ``He is now in the joy of heaven, surrounded by those who, like
him, fought the good fight, purifying their faith in the crucible
of suffering,'' said John Paul, speaking from an altar before a
5-meter (15-foot) high portrait of Stepinac.
	   A silver box, containing a relict of the new church blessed _ a
finger _ was placed under the portrait.
	   The pope, who battled communism in his own Polish homeland,
stressed Stepinac's treatment by Yugoslavia's communist regime
after the war, saying the last 15 years of his life ``were a
continual succession of trials.''
	   Some 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million population is Catholic,
and the Vatican looks at the country as a Catholic bastion in the
Balkans, amid Orthodox Christians and Muslims.
	   Stipe Dorotic, a 38-year electrician from eastern Croatia, who
attended the ceremony said hoped that the beatification ``will
enable Croats to face the future with more confidence and faith.''
	   Croatia was a part of communist-run Yugoslavia until 1991, when
it proclaimed independence. The Vatican was one of the first states
to recognize its independence.
	   The secession of Croatia, and later of neighboring Bosnia, led
to bloody wars in which tens of thousands of people were killed.
	   It is John Paul's second visit to Croatia, following a 1994
pilgrimage. He flew to Sarajevo last year, realizing his desire to
pay tribute to those who suffered during the war.
	   He also toured Slovenia in the former Yugoslavia, but has not
been to Serbia, apparently because of resistance from Orthodox
leaders.

New Zealand's Turner, Sweden's Jacobson share Belgacom Open lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KNOKKE, Belgium (AP) _ Greg Turner of New Zealand and Sweden's
Fredric Jacobson on Saturday shared the lead of the Belgian
Belgacom Open at 12-under par going into the final round. England's
Lee Westwood was just one stroke back.
	   Turner shot a four-under par 67 in cold and damp conditions to
make up two strokes on Jacobson.
	   Westwood, currently No. 2 in the European Tour Order of Merit,
also snuck closer to the lead with a 67 and maintained his chances
to rob Scot Colin Montgomerie, a no-show here, of the Order of
Merit title during the season-ending Volvo Masters at the end of
the month.
	   Jacobson, who has been troubled by back pains this week, shot a
69 and is in a prime position to finish in the top eight to
guarantee his Tour card next season.
	   Sweden's Jarmo Sandelin and Germany Sven Struver were two shots
off the pace at 10-under.
	   Westwood has been eyeing the 66,600 pound (dlrs 113,000) top
prize here would bring him within striking distance of Montgomerie.
He is currently 112,000 pounds (dlrs 190,000) behind Montgomerie's
leading 760,077 pounds (dlrs 1.29 million). Two victories in the
last two events would give Westwood the Order of Merit title,
whatever Montgomery did.
	   Jacobson needs a good showing at the 400,000-pound (dlrs
680,000) Belgacom Open to hold on to his European Tour Card. He has
only won 44,000 pounds (dlrs 75,000) and needs to finish in the top
eight to hold on to his tour card.
	   Nick Faldo, who won the Belgian Open when it was last held in
1994, slumped further back on Saturday with a second 72 in a row
and was a in tie at four-under.

	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Those who could vote Saturday on whether to
ease citizenship laws for hundreds of thousands of stateless ethnic
Russians were often confused, and those who couldn't were stony
with resentment.
	   A referendum held in conjunction with voting for the country's
100-seat Saeima parliament asked voters if they want to reject
liberalizing citizenship law amendments that the parliament passed
in June.
	   The amendments were passed after a tense spring in which Russia
threatened trade sanctions against diminutive neighbor and rained a
hot barrage of denunciations, including Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov's
characterizing Latvia as committing genocide.
	   Meanwhile, the West was unhappy with Latvia, though its
statements were more measured. The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe urged changes and many officials predicted
that the European Union, which Latvia ardently wants to join, would
never let the country in unless it lowered the obstacles to
citizenship.
	   But after the amendments were passed, a referendum drive to
overturn them began, spearheaded by nationalist politicians who
claim Latvian national identity is imperiled.
	   After Latvia became independent of the Soviet Union in 1991,
citizenship was granted to ethnic Latvians and to anyone who had
lived there prior to the Soviet annexation in 1940.
	   That left out the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians who
poured into Latvia during Soviet rule, and to their children even
if born in Latvia. Today, about 452,000 of the country's 740,000
ethnic Russians are without citizenship.
	   Because they can't vote, they regarded Saturday's referendum
with angry resignation.
	   ``I was born in Riga, I live in Riga, but I am Russian and can't
vote. I don't like it here,'' said a young woman who gave her name
only as Alex, selling cassettes in the vast market that sprawls in
and around five old dirigible hangars on the outskirts of downtown.
	   But many people who could vote were annoyed because the
referendum question was phrased confusingly: a ``yes'' vote meaning
``no'' to the changes.
	   ``Frankly, I didn't understand the issue or the ballot,'' said
79-yar-old Dzetins Alois, who voted in the parliamentary election
but not in the referendum.
	   He wasn't alone. The Central Elections Commission said that as
of 4 p.m. (1300 GMT), about 55 percent of the 1.3 million people
eligible to vote had cast ballots in the election, but about 52
percent in the referendum.
	   Some voting irregularities were reported, including President
Guntis Ulmanis giving a television interview inside a polling
station, and a polling place in the city of Jurmala failing to
stamp about 200 ballots properly.
	   The referendum apparently slowed down voting procedures and
elections commission head Arnis Cimdars said he was concerned the
pace might be too slow to have voting completed on time.
	   Of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats in the Saeima
(pronounced SIGH-mah), the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party
of Prime Minister Guntars Krasts was the only major party
campaigning to turn down the changes.
	   But even that party's support on the issue was not universal.
	   Harijs Vasilievs said he voted for Fatherland and Freedom party
because he liked their economic polices, though he voted against
the referendum
	   ``I think Russian children born in Latvia should be given
citizenship,'' the 61-year-old Vasilievs said. ``They are not to
blame for the situation they have found themselves in.''
	   On issues other than citizenship, like the need to seek EU and
NATO membership, there is wide agreement among the parties. There
is also broad support for the free-market reforms that have raised
Latvia up from the stagnant Soviet era.
	   Voter support for one party or another appeared to depend as
much on the personality of leaders as on specific issues.
	   The party that has been No. 1 in most pre-election polls with
around 20 percent support is the center-right Peoples Party, a new
party founded by wealthy businessman and a former prime minister,
Andris Skele.
	   Skele has said Latvia relies too much on transit trade to and
from Russia, and said policies should also focus on producing goods
in Latvia for export.

	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ While Latvians voted on a citizenship law
that has sparked diplomatic fights between Riga and Moscow, Latvia
and Russia had another battle Saturday _ on the soccer field.
	   In a game that was part of a local tournament for diplomats,
staff from the Latvian Foreign Ministry and the Russian Embassy
squared off at midday.
	   After playing to a 1-1 tie in the first half, the Russians
regrouped and won 3-1.
	   Latvian player Toms Baumanis, press secretary at the foreign
ministry, said the ``atmosphere of the game was fun and friendly.''
	   ``It increases our informal contacts, and that can always be
helpful,'' he said.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Shaun Bartlett headed in
Quinton Fortune's free kick in the 88th minute Saturday, and South
Africa squeezed past an overwhelmed Angola 1-0 in an African Cup
Group Four qualifier.
	   The Bafana Bafana hit the post once in each half before Bartlett
redirected Fortune's 25-meter free kick.
	   South Africa repeatedly threatened the Black Panthers' net,
dominating possession but was plagued by poor finishing.
	   The match was the first for South Africa in qualifying for the
2000 African championship. Angola had advanced to the group play by
eliminating Benin in first-round play.

Labor loser in Australian election looks like the only big winner
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QC; 
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard defeated Kim
Beazley and the Labor Party in Saturday's election, but Beazley
looks like the big winner in the long run.
	   Beazley lost the vote, but he took a Labor Party humiliated and
ousted by the voters just 2 1/2 years ago and brought it within
reach of victory, a feat no one believed possible a year ago.
	   Beazley knocked the conservative majority down from 91 seats in
the 148-seat House of Representatives to perhaps 71, with vote
counting still going on, gaining at least 17 seats for Labor.
	   It's the biggest comeback since World War II for a party forced
out in the previous election, Beazley told an ecstatic crowd in his
home district of Brand, south of Perth.
	   Beazley, an avuncular, heavy-set man, has won the respect and
affection of many Australians, and is well-positioned for a
victorious campaign in three years or less.
	   Political analysts do not expect his opponent to be Howard, the
putative winner Saturday.
	   It is widely anticipated that Howard will be dumped in a year or
so, probably by his ambitious treasurer, Peter Costello, who
admitted in a radio interview just a few weeks ago that Liberal
Party figures were urging him to challenge Howard.
	   Costello then pledged his total loyalty to Howard _ typically an
ominous portent for any leader.
	   Even without having to watch his back, Howard may come to feel
that his victory is hollow.
	   He will have to fight to push his tax reform plan through the
Senate, where his party will not hold a majority.
	   And how Howard can keep his promise to cut income taxes if the
economy worsens in the wake of the Asian crisis remains to be seen.
	   Further, the Senate, as well as some backbenchers in his own
Liberal Party and the National Party, the junior partner in his
governing conservative coalition, also objects to his plan to sell
off the government's remaining majority share of the national
telecommunications giant Telstra Corp.
	   But by far the biggest loser Saturday was right-wing populist
leader Pauline Hanson, who predicted that she would win her own
House of Representatives seat and that her One Nation party would
win 12 to 15 House seats and six in the Senate.
	   The outcome: Hanson lost her own seat, and One Nation won no
seats in the House. It won only one Senate seat, in Queensland.
	   Hanson, elected to Parliament as an independent in 1996, had
dominated Australian politics since her inaugural speech later that
year. In it she warned that Australia was in danger of being
``swamped by Asians'' and opposed land rights and special welfare
benefits for Aborigines.
	   Hanson's response to her loss? ``I believe there is a lot of
support for One Nation. We're not going away anywhere.''

Mubarak arrives in Saudi for talks with Fahd
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
arrived Saturday for a one-day visit to discuss regional problems
with Saudi King Fahd and other high-ranking officials.
	   The talks will focus on the Middle East peace process and the
recent military tensions between Turkey and Syria over Turkish
allegations that Syria is harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels,
diplomats said.
	   The two leaders also will discuss the U.N. air embargo on Libya,
said the diplomats on condition of anonymity. The embargo is aimed
at forcing Libya to hand over for trial two suspects wanted for the
1988 bombing of an American jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   This is the first time that Fahd, who is in his mid-70s, is
meeting with a foreign leader since undergoing surgery Aug. 12 to
have his gallbladder removed.
	   Fahd's half-brother, Crown Prince Abdullah, handled the
kingdom's day-to-day affairs during the king's hospitalization.

Villa moves six points clear; Man U crushes Saints; Graham sees
</HEADLINE>
Spurs win at Derby &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Ian Taylor scored twice as Aston Villa stretched
its Premier League lead to six points Saturday by winning yet again
at Coventry while Manchester United climbed to second with a 3-0
victory at last place Southampton.
	   Two days after taking over at Spurs, new manager George Graham
watched his team score a 1-0 victory at second place Derby with
England defender Sol Campbell heading the only goal.
	   Villa made it six Highfield Road successes in a row with a 2-1
win over neighbor Coventry and have also beaten the Sky Blues three
times at Villa Park in league meetings.
	   Although Norwegian substitute Egil Soltvedt replied 19 minutes
from the end, John Gregory's unbeaten team looked well in control
and now has 20 points from eight games.
	   United made it 14 from seven by winning for the first time in
five seasons at Southampton including three losses in a row.
	   Former Villa striker Dwight Yorke, Andy Cole and substitute
Jordi Cruyff netted the goals in a one-sided game which moved
United up four places and leaves sorry Saints with only one point
from eight outings. Coventry remained next to last with five.
	   Graham decided to leave David Pleat in charge one last time at
Spurs before taking over officially on Monday and watched from the
stands as Campbell's header from David Ginola's cross downed Derby
at Pride Park.
	   Leeds, the team he left on Thursday, tumbled 1-0 at home to
Leicester, whose manager, Martin O'Neill, is being strongly tipped
to take over at Elland Road now Graham has moved on. Veteran
striker Tony Cottee scored the winner 14 minutes from the end.
	   Middlesbrough moved confidently up to third place with a 5-0
crushing of Sheffield Wednesday. Danish forward Mikkel Beck scored
three times, Colombian forward Hamilton Ricard also scored and Paul
Gascoigne fired home a free kick.
	   Struggling Blackburn gained a 3-0 victory over high-flying West
Ham with two goals from Gary Flitcroft helping Rovers gain only its
second win of the season.
	   Charlton's first away win came at Nottingham Forest through
defender Eddie Youds while Everton came from behind at Wimbledon to
win 2-1 thanks to strikes by Danny Cadamarteri and Duncan Ferguson.
	   The two most attractive games of the weekend's program are
Sunday, when champion Arsenal welcomes Newcastle and Liverpool
hosts Chelsea.
	   Huddersfield moved two points clear in division one with a 2-0
victory over Oxford United while Sunderland was held 0-0 at home by
Bradford.
	   Kilmarnock opened up a one-point lead in the Scottish Premier
League but should have made it three after being held 0-0 at home
by Dunfermline.
	   The tie means that Rangers can regain top spot Sunday by beating
Dundee at home.

<TEXT>
	   MARIJA BISTRICA, Croatia (AP) _ Declaring him a martyr of the
faith, Pope John Paul II on Saturday honored Croatia's World War II
cardinal, a hero to Roman Catholics, but long a symbol of divisions
in the Balkans.
	   Half a million people watched with delight and gratitude as John
Paul beatified Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, elevating him to the
last step before possible sainthood, in Marija Bistrica, Croatia's
leading shrine to the Virgin Mary.
	   John Paul appealed to a country that has suffered from war and
ethnic divisions ``to forgive and reconcile and to purify one's
memory of hatred'' and ``the desire for revenge.''
	   The pope said Stepinac ,''having endured in his own body and his
own spirit the atrocities of the communist system, is now entrusted
to the memory of his fellow countrymen with the radiant badge of
martyrdom.''
	   Later Saturday, the pontiff met Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman at his palace in the capital Zagreb. Government officials
and foreign ambassadors, including Veljko Knezevic, the ambassador
of Serb-led Yugoslavia, were also present to greet John Paul.

	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Those who could vote Saturday on whether to
ease Latvian citizenship laws for hundreds of thousands of
stateless ethnic Russians were often confused, and those who
couldn't were stony with resentment.
	   A referendum held in conjunction with voting for the 100-seat
Saeima parliament asked voters if they want to reject liberalizing
citizenship law amendments that the parliament passed in June.
	   The amendments were passed after a tense spring in which Russia
threatened trade sanctions against its neighbor and rained a hot
barrage of denunciations upon it, including Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov's accusation that Latvia was committing genocide.
	   The West too was unhappy with Latvia, though its statements were
more measured. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe urged changes and many officials predicted that the European
Union, which Latvia ardently wants to join, would never let the
country in unless it lowered the obstacles to citizenship.
	   After the amendments were passed, a drive to overturn them
began, spearheaded by nationalist politicians who claim Latvian
national identity is imperiled.
	   After Latvia became independent of the Soviet Union in 1991,
citizenship was granted to ethnic Latvians and to anyone who had
lived there prior to the Soviet annexation in 1940.
	   That left out the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians who
poured into Latvia during Soviet rule, and to their children, even
if born in Latvia. Today about 452,000 of the country's 740,000
ethnic Russians are without citizenship.
	   Because they can't vote, they regarded Saturday's referendum
with angry resignation.
	   ``I was born in Riga, I live in Riga, but I am Russian and can't
vote. I don't like it here,'' said a young woman who gave her name
only as Alex, selling cassettes in the vast market that sprawls in
and around five old dirigible hangars on the outskirts of downtown.
	   Many people who could vote were annoyed because the referendum
question was phrased confusingly: a ``yes'' vote meaning ``no'' to
the changes.
	   ``Frankly, I didn't understand the issue or the ballot,'' said
79-year-old Dzetins Alois, who voted in the parliamentary election
but not in the referendum.
	   He wasn't alone. The Central Elections Commission said that as
of 4 p.m. (1300 GMT), about 55 percent of the 1.3 million people
eligible to vote had cast ballots in the election, while about 52
percent had in the referendum.
	   Some voting irregularities were reported, including President
Guntis Ulmanis giving a television interview inside a polling
station, and a polling place in the city of Jurmala failing to
stamp about 200 ballots properly.
	   The referendum apparently slowed voting procedures and elections
commission head Arnis Cimdars said he was concerned the pace might
be too slow to have voting completed on time.
	   Of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats in the Saeima
(pronounced SIGH-mah), the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party
of Prime Minister Guntars Krasts was the only major party
campaigning to turn down the changes.
	   But even that party's support on the issue was not universal.
	   Harijs Vasilievs said he voted for the Fatherland and Freedom
party because he liked their economic polices, though he voted
against the referendum
	   ``I think Russian children born in Latvia should be given
citizenship,'' the 61-year-old Vasilievs said. ``They are not to
blame for the situation they have found themselves in.''
	   On issues other than citizenship, like the need to seek EU and
NATO membership, there is wide agreement among the parties. There
is also broad support for the free-market reforms that have raised
Latvia from the stagnant Soviet era.
	   Voter support for one party or another appeared to depend as
much on the personality of leaders as on specific issues.
	   The party that has been No. 1 in most pre-election polls with
around 20 percent support is the center-right Peoples Party, a new
party founded by wealthy businessman and former prime minister
Andris Skele.
	   Skele has said Latvia relies too much on transit trade to and
from Russia, and said policies should also focus on producing goods
in Latvia for export.

Romanian star gymnast Gina Gogean retires
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romanian star gymnast Gina Gogean, who
made a name with impeccable routines and stoic demeanor, has
officially retired from competition, a news agency reported
Saturday.
	   During a gymnastics championship in the eastern city of Focsani,
Gogean, 21, said Friday she planned to become an ``appreciated

has an offer from the Focsani gymnastics school, it said.
	   Known for her solemn expressions, Gogean won two gold medals -

she could not maintain her high standard.

Games and won 30 medals in international competitions during her

Rusedski, Siemerink to meet in Toulouse final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) - Greg Rusedski and Jan Siemerink, the top
two seeds, won their semifinal matches Saturday and will meet in
the final of the dlrs 400,000 Toulouse Open tennis tournament.
	   Britain's Rusedski, the top seed and world No. 14, swept away
defending champion and No. 4 seed Nicolas Kiefer of Germany, 6-4,
6-1.
	   Rusedski again demonstrated his powerful serve - at this year's
India Wells tournament he served at 239.7 kmh (133 mph), a world
record - and impressed with fine backhand shots, which are normally
a weaker part of his game.
	   Siemerink had a far tougher path to the final, beating No. 3
seed Thomas Johansson of Sweden, 6-3, 3-6, 7-5.
	   Resedski and Siemink will play the championship match Sunday.

U.S. officials seek extra time for extradition of terror suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ U.S. prosecutors have asked for a 20-day
extension to provide Germany with paperwork necessary to extradite
a top lieutenant of Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden,
officials said Saturday.
	   Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, 40, of Sudan, has been jailed since his
arrest near Munich on Sept. 16 by Bavarian authorities acting on a
U.S. warrant.
	   Under German law, U.S. officials have 40 days after the arrest
to turn over supporting evidence so a German court can rule on
their extradition request. A Bavarian Justice Ministry spokesman,
Gerhard Zierl, said U.S. authorities a few days ago asked the court
hearing the case for an extra 20 days to provide the necessary
material.
	   Quoting unidentified Bavarian law enforcement sources, Focus
newsmagazine reported Saturday that the evidence turned over so far
was not very strong. The magazine said much of it was based on the
testimony of an FBI informant, a former bin Laden associate, who
made only vague connections between Salim and terrorist activities.
	   Zierl declined to comment on the report, but said U.S.
authorities probably asked for more time just a precautionary
measure.
	   U.S. authorities charge Salim helped finance, train and arm
members of a terrorist organization, including the alleged bombers
of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   A criminal complaint unsealed Sept. 25 in U.S. District Court in
New York charges him with murder conspiracy and use of weapons of
mass destruction.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Two French warships will conduct an exercise with
Kuwait's navy during a five-day visit to this oil-rich state, a
senior French Navy official said Saturday.
	   ``If one day we have to undertake a dangerous big operation
(with the Kuwaitis), we have to be used to working together,'' said
Rear Adm. Jean-Louis Battet, commander of the French maritime
forces in the Indian Ocean.
	   He was speaking to reporters on board La Somme, a supply and
command ship that arrived Saturday along with the frigate La
Fayette.
	   The ships were anchored at Shuwaik Port, just west of Kuwait
City.
	   Battet described the one-day war games scheduled for Thursday as
``basic and tactical.'' Elaborate ones were being planned for next
year, he said.
	   He said La Somme and La Fayette will take part in similar
exercises with the navies of Qatar, Oman and the United Arab
Emirates.
	   France was a member of the U.S.-led coalition that fought the
Gulf War to evict Iraqi troops from Kuwait in February 1991.
	   The oil-rich Gulf state signed 10-year defense pacts with the
United States, Britain, France and China after the war.

	   GRENOBLE, France (AP) _ A lock of King Louis XVI's gray hair,
shorn minutes after the monarch was beheaded during the French
Revolution 205 years ago, was auctioned off Saturday for 31,000
francs (dlrs 5,536).
	   A French collector who asked not to be identified by name
acquired the hair, encased in a period frame decorated with a gold
coin and three ``fleurs de lys,'' the symbol of French royalty.
	   ``It's for a royalist friend of mine who had heard about this
relic,'' said the buyer, refusing to elaborate.
	   Several telephone bids were taken during the auction, over in

Nurse escapes death sentence after court reduces charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A court on Saturday reduced a premeditated
murder charge to manslaughter against a nurse accused of injecting
30 patients with poison. The ruling freed her from a death sentence
imposed in an earlier trial.
	   The Alexandria Criminal Court said that while Aida Nur el-Din
did inject her patients with a ``harmful substance'' she did so
``without intending to kill them.''
	   The court did not say why Nur el-Din would have wanted to inject
the substance, which it did not identify.
	   Nur el-Din's case received wide attention in Egypt after she
fell from the third story of a police station while being led to an
interrogation room following her arrest in the port city of
Alexandria where the alleged crimes were committed.
	   She has never said whether she jumped or was pushed. However, in
pleading innocent, the 25-year-old nurse said she was framed by
hospital officials trying to cover their own negligence.
	   The allegations also provided grist to the critics of the poor
working and health standards at government hospitals, and renewed
allegations by nurses nationwide that they are overworked,
underpaid and abused by doctors.
	   An Alexandria court sentenced Nur el-Din to death on March 11
after convicting her of murdering Mohammed Abdel-Qader Ibrahim and
trying to kill 29 other patients by injecting them with respiratory
muscle relaxants.
	   But the Court of Cassation ordered a retrial in July on grounds
that the trial court had failed to make sure that she had intended
to kill Ibrahim.
	   Nur el-Din's case received a boost when the prosecutor general
himself told the appeals court that the nurse was not sure that the
injections were fatal. Therefore, she did not have the intention to
kill, he said.
	   Nur el-Din will now be tried on Nov. 1 under the new charge of
manslaughter, which carries between three to seven years of hard
labor upon conviction.
	   Immediately after the ruling, about 150 people, including
friends, lawyers and relatives, burst out of the court into
el-Mensheya square in downtown Alexandria to celebrate the ruling.
	   Police did not block the hour-long celebrations.

Agassi outlasts Kucera in five-set marathon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Andre Agassi saved four match points and
won the last 11 games of the match to beat a tiring Karol Kucera in
five sets Saturday and reach the final of the dlrs 6.7 million
Grand Slam Cup.
	   Agassi won 7-6 (7-1), 6-7 (5-7), 2-6, 7-5, 6-0 in a match that
lasted three hours and 40 minutes.
	   ``I wasn't expecting that one today, that's for sure,'' Agassi
said. ``It was real good tennis, there's no question about it. To
win that one in five sets certainly was very satisfying.''
	   ``He is a great player and a great competitor'' Agassi said of
Kucera.
	   The American trailed 5-2 in the fourth set and Kucera served for
the match.
	   But the Slovak was unable to convert four match points as his
errors combined with some spectacular and risky shot-making by
Agassi.
	   Kucera sent a forehand into the net to drop the game and Agassi
gained the momentum, winning 11 games in a row to close out the
match.
	   ``He started stretching his legs early in the fourth set. He was
getting very tired.
	   ``I felt if I could just get back into it, I certainly liked my
chances,'' Agassi said.
	   As Kucera began to cramp, Agassi took full advantage of the
opportunity and never let up the pressure, keeping a visibly tiring
Kucera constantly on the move.
	   Kucera was unable to keep with up with Agassi's pace and his
game collapsed.
	   During changeovers, Kucera had his legs massaged by a trainer
and he offered little resistance in the final set.
	   Kucera said he was feeling tired already after the first set.
	   ``But from 5-2 in the fourth, it was really bad,'' he said. ``I
tried to keep the rallies as short as possible. I couldn't really
run too much.''
	   While Kucera had 18 aces, he also had 16 double-faults,
including one on set point in the fourth and on match point. He
also had 76 unforced errors. Agassi had seven aces and only four
double-faults.
	   Agassi could have made things easier for himself had he won the
second set, for which he served twice.
	   The last time Agassi came back from a match point to win the
match, he said, was at the 1994 Canadian Open against David
Wheaton.
	   Agassi took some measure of revenge for his five-set loss to
Kucera in the Round of 16 in last month's U.S. Open.
	   The American was a wild-card entry in the tournament that
nominally brings together players with the best records in the four
Grand Slam events of the year _ the Australian, French and U.S.
Open and Wimbledon.
	   After the withdrawal of top-ranked Pete Sampras and No. 2
Patrick Rafter, organizers invited Agassi although his Grand Slam
record this year was not good enough to earn him a direct spot in
the 12-man field.
	   Now, he could end up earning dlrs 1.3 million by winning the
title. The losing men's finalist will get dlrs 650,000.
	   In the second semifinal later Saturday, Mark Philippoussis
played Marcelo Rios.
	   Kucera is enjoying the best year of his career. He was a
semifinalist in the Australian Open after beating Sampras and a
quarterfinalist in the U.S. Open, rising to No. 6 in the rankings.
	   Agassi has won four tournaments on the ATP Tour this year,
although he never got past the Round of 16 at any of the four Grand
Slams.
	   But he has come out of a deep slump during which he had dropped
out of the top 100. A former No. 1, Agassi is now ranked No. 8.
	   He beat the only Grand Slam champion here, Australian Open
winner Petr Korda, in the quarterfinals, remaining the only former
Grand Slam champion in the draw.
	   Agassi has three Grand Slam title, 1992 Wimbledon, 1994 U.S.
Open and 1995 Australian Open.

Russia hopes fishing deal with Japan will boost cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Foreign Ministry said Saturday that it
hoped a new fishing agreement with Japan will lead to cooperation
in other areas.
	   The agreement, which took effect Thursday, allows Japan to fish
off the southern Kuril Islands, which are claimed by both
countries.
	   ``The history of Russian-Japanese ties indicates that relations
in the field of fishing have traditionally served as an indicator
of trust between the two countries,'' the Foreign Ministry said in
a statement.
	   ``This agreement is the result of new favorable tendencies aimed
at strengthening good-neighborliness and partnership between Russia
and Japan,'' the statement said.
	   The conflicting claims over the Kuril Islands, seized by the
Soviet army at the end of World War II, have prevented Russia and
Japan from signing a formal peace treaty ending the war.

	   Details of Premier League games:
 &UR; Blackburn 3, West Ham 0 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Gary Flitcroft gave Rovers the lead in the 10th minute with a
shot that deflected off Hammers defender Rio Ferdinand. Two minutes
into the second half he made it 2-0, taking a misplaced Ferdinand
back pass and shooting home. Defender Callum Davidson scored the
third in the 68th, going on a 30-meter (yard) run, cutting inside
and firing home.
 &UR; Coventry 1, Aston Villa 2 (0-2) &QC; 
	   Ian Taylor's 12-meter shot gave Villa a 29th minute lead after
Coventry failed to clear a cross from Gary Charles. He scored the
second 10 minutes later from Paul Merson's pass with Coventry
appealing for offside against Merson. Egil Soltvedt replied in the
71st minute from Dion Dublin's neat backheel. Villa manager John
Gregory fielded Stan Collymore alongside Paul Merson in attack
after his three-goal performance in the UEFA Cup, but he failed to
hit the target this time.
 &UR; Derby 0, Tottenham 1 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Sol Campbell's glancing header in the 60th minute from David
Ginola's free kick was the only goal. Spurs Swiss defender Ramon
Vega snuffed out the threat of Derby's Costa Rican star Paolo
Wanchope and Graham's team for once looked confident with Les
Ferdinand and Darren Anderton impressive going forward.
 &UR; Leeds 0, Leicester 1 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Taking temporary charge of the Leeds team while the owners look
for a replacement for George Graham, assistant coach David O'Leary
had a losing start as caretaker-manager. Tony Cottee scored
Leicester's winner in the 76th minute from Emile Heskey's cross.
 &UR; Middlesbrough 4, Sheffield Wednesday 0 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Mikkel Beck put Middlesbrough on the way to its first home win
of the season with a close range shot in the 27th minute after
six-man move. He added the second from a long cross by Gianluca
Festa just before half time and Hamilton Ricard scored the third
four minutes into the second half after taking a misplaced pass by
Emerson Thome. Beck thought he'd completed a hat-trick in the 71st
minute but it was disallowed and was racing for goal again at the
end when he was brought down by Andy Hinchcliffe, who was expelled.
Paul Gascoigne curled in the free kick.
 &UR; Nottingham Forest 0, Charlton 1 (0-1) &QC; 
	   Charlton defender Eddie Youds netted a 12-meter shot in the
fifth minute from Carl Tiler's header. Australian-born Yugoslav
goalkeeper Sasa Ilic, likely to be playing a European Championship
qualifying game against Ireland next week, protected the lead with
a series of saves from Neil Shipperley, Dougie Freedman and Steve
Chettle and Forest now has scored only once in its last six league
games.
 &UR; Southampton 0, Manchester United 3 (0-1) &QC; 
	   United's Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel was sidelined with
stomach muscle injury but most of the action was at the other end.
Dwight Yorke turned in cross from striker partner Andy Cole in the
11th minute and Cole made it 2-0 in the 59th minute from Jesper
Blomqvist's run and cross. United sent on Jordi Cruyff and Teddy
Sheringham and the Dutch forward volleyed the third in the 74th
minute.
 &UR; Wimbledon 1, Everton 2 (1-1) &QC; 
	   Andy Roberts' 20-meter shot in the eighth minute gave the Dons
the lead but Everton hit back to win. Danny Cadamertari cut inside

Leverkusen and Kaiserslautern draw, but 1860 keeps heat on Bayern
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Paulo Rink's 65th minute header helped Bayer
Leverkusen salvage a 2-2 draw Saturday in the Bundesliga against FC
Kaiserslautern _ the defending champions who seem to have forgotten
how to win.
	   Rink, a Brazilian with a German passport trying to earn a steady
berth on his new country's national team, blasted in his header off
a cross from midfielder Stefan Beinlich as the contest ended 2-2.
	   Kaiserslautern's failure to win has reached five straight
outings including league contests, the German Cup and Champions
Cup. But coach Otto Rehhagel denied the club is slumping.
	   ``We haven't been and aren't in a crisis,'' said Rehhagel.
``We're a good team and we played a good match.''
	   But with Leverkusen and Kaiserslautern not living up to
expectations in league play, surprising 1860 Munich has mounted the
only real early season challenge to its unbeaten and more
celebrated cross-town rival.
	   1860 blasted FC Nuremberg 5-1, solidifying its hold on second in
the table. Boasting a 5-1-1 record, they are only two points behind
Bayern Munich, which plays Sunday against Dortmund.
	   Leverkusen's latest Brazilian acquisition, Ze Roberto, scored
his first goal for the team in the eighth minute, but Olaf
Marschall answered for Kaiserlautern in the 32nd. It was a
league-best seventh goal for the lanky forward.
	   In a well-played contest, Kaiserslautern went ahead 2-1 nine
minutes later on Bulgarian Mariam Hristov's shot. But once again
the team's leaky defense blew a lead, yielding Rink's equalizer as
German national team coach Erich Ribbeck watched in the stands.
	   1860, vowing their goal is the league title and not just
reaching international competition, added a few more believers with
the most one-sided away win for the club in 32 years.
	   Nuremburg was thrashed in front of 44,600 as the 1860 Lions
picked apart its defense with goals by Markus Schrott, Harald
Cerny, Bernhard Winkler, Michael Dinzey and Christo Jovov.
	   ``It can't be that every week the other team is weak _ some of
it has to be us,'' said Winkler, whose goal was his sixth of the
season.
	   In other matches, SC Freiburg and Hamburger SV played a 0-0
draw, Hansa Rostock edged Werder Bremen 2-1 in a battle of
struggling clubs and VfL Bochum and Eintracht Frankfurt also played
to 0-0.
	   On Friday, Hertha Berlin remained unbeaten at home in
Olympiastadium by blasting Moenchengladbach 4-1 and a contest
between Schalke and Wolfsburg ended 0-0.
	   Rostock needed a header by Matthias Breitkreutz with two minute
left to win against Bremen. Oliver Neuville, jumping on a blackout
by the opposing keeper, had put the East German club ahead before
Bernhard Trares equalized.

Balkan heads of state meet as NATO ponders strikes in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Simitis saying he feels not all EU nations agree
with military action, RECASTS throughout &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos DEL101-2
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DELPHI, Greece (AP) _ Premier Costas Simitis said Saturday that
not all European leaders are convinced that military action in
Kosovo is the best way out of the crisis.
	   Simitis had telephone discussions on the issue with his
counterparts Lionel Jospin of France and Romano Prodi of Italy, as
well as German Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder.
	   After the calls, he said he was far from being convinced of the
inevitability of NATO military action.
	   ``I don't have this feeling, that it (strikes) is a fact, that
it is decided and that they will go ahead. I have the feeling that
all are troubled about the way to best deal with the crisis,''
Simitis said.
	   His calls came from Delphi, home of the ancient oracle, during
the first day of a trilateral meeting with the leaders of Romania
and Bulgaria.
	   Earlier, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos claimed
Western powers are blowing the Kosovo crisis out of all proportion,
and neighboring countries will have to pay the price of possible
military strikes in the Serb province.
	   ``Many people are taking decisions for what is happening in the
Balkans, but the final price is paid for by the three countries
meeting here,'' Pangalos said.
	   The trilateral meeting is being held days before United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan is to submit a report on Yugoslav
compliance with a Security Council resolution, essentially
demanding an end to the Kosovo offensive by Yugoslav authorities.
	   The resolution threatens unspecified further action, seen by
many as the decision NATO needs for military intervention.
	   Bulgaria, Romania and Greece support greater autonomy for Kosovo
Albanians, but disagree with their demand for full independence,
Simitis said.
	   All three countries are concerned the crisis could lead to a
regional war, but their opposition to military intervention stems
from fears of a repetition of the Bosnian war and the sanctions
that harmed their economies.
	   ``Our three countries have an interest and an imperative duty to
contribute with all their strength to ease the crisis which will
have generally unfavorable consequences for all the countries,''
Pangalos said.
	   Simitis noted that European states ``have to take actions if
necessary; positive actions, not negative actions if they see that
between the countries of the region there is a common will to
overcome problems.''
	   Presidents Petar Stoyanov of Bulgaria and Emil Constantinescu of
Romania also brought up the issue of their applications for entry
into the European Union and NATO during the meeting at this ancient
site, located on a rocky and forested mountain 180 kilometers (112
miles) north of Athens.
	   Greece, which is a member of both organizations, has been
pushing the candidacies in the hope of increasing stability in the
volatile Balkans.
	   The two countries ``are in a far better position to enter the EU
than many other candidates that are discussing now with the EU,''
Simitis said.
	   NATO and EU enlargement must encompass as many countries as
possible, Simitis noted.
	   ``A narrow enlargement would cause further division in the
continent,'' he said. ``The enlargement should be broad based and
should promote security and stability in the whole region.''

Pope John Paul II beatifies controversial World War II cardinal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE UPDATES with pontiff meeting
Croatian president, ADD detail. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By VICTOR L. SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARIJA BISTRICA, Croatia (AP) _ Declaring him a martyr of the
faith, Pope John Paul II on Saturday honored Croatia's World War II
cardinal, a hero to Roman Catholics, but long a symbol of division
in the Balkans.
	   Half a million people watched with delight and gratitude as John
Paul beatified Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, elevating him to the
last step before possible sainthood, in Marija Bistrica, Croatia's
leading shrine to the Virgin Mary.
	   John Paul appealed to a country that has suffered war and ethnic
divisions ``to forgive and reconcile and to purify one's memory of
hatred'' and ``the desire for revenge.''
	   The pope said Stepinac, ''having endured in his own body and his
own spirit the atrocities of the communist system, is now entrusted
to the memory of his fellow countrymen with the radiant badge of
martyrdom.''
	   Later Saturday, the pontiff met Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman at his palace in the capital, Zagreb. Government officials
and foreign ambassadors, including Veljko Knezevic, the ambassador
of Serb-led Yugoslavia, were also present to greet John Paul.
	   Stepinac was hailed as a hero by Catholics for his resistance to
communism and refusal to separate the Croatian church from the
Vatican. But his beatification is controversial because many Serbs
and Jews accuse him of sympathizing with the Nazis.
	   While serving as Zagreb's archbishop in 1941, Stepinac supported
Croatia's German-backed fascist puppet government, led by dictator
Ante Pavelic. By 1942, however, Stepinac had denounced the regime's
genocidal policies, which led to the extermination of thousands of
Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croat opponents.
	   He died at 62 in 1960, under house arrest following his
conviction on charges of collaborating with the Nazis. Stepinac's
own notes and recent studies say he spoke out against the
atrocities and worked to save lives, but many Serbs still consider
him a war criminal.
	   The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a U.S.-based Nazi-hunting group,
had asked the Vatican to postpone the beatification pending further
study of the cardinal's actions, although some local Jews defended
Stepinac.
	   John Paul addressed the criticism in his homily, quoting from a
1943 address by the cardinal condemning injustice and the killing
of innocents. He said Stepinac summed up ``the whole tragedy which
befell the Croatian people and Europe in the course of this century
marked by the three great evils of fascism, national socialism and
communism.''
	   ``He is now in the joy of heaven, surrounded by those who, like
him, fought the good fight, purifying their faith in the crucible
of suffering,'' said John Paul, speaking from an altar before a
5-meter (15-foot) high portrait of Stepinac.
	   A silver box containing a relic of the cardinal _ a finger _ was
placed under the portrait.
	   The pope, who battled communism in his own Polish homeland,
stressed Stepinac's treatment by Yugoslavia's communist regime
after the war, saying the last 15 years of his life ``were a
continual succession of trials.''
	   Some 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million population is Catholic,
and the Vatican looks at the country as a Catholic bastion in the
Balkans, amid Orthodox Christians and Muslims.
	   Stipe Dorotic, a 38-year electrician from eastern Croatia,
attended the ceremony, saying he hoped that the beatification
``will enable Croats to face the future with more confidence and
faith.''
	   Croatia was a part of communist-run Yugoslavia until 1991, when
it proclaimed independence. The Vatican was one of the first states
to recognize that move.
	   The secession of Croatia, and later of neighboring Bosnia, led
to bloody wars in which tens of thousands of people were killed.
	   It is John Paul's second visit to Croatia, following a 1994
pilgrimage. He flew to Sarajevo last year, realizing his desire to
pay tribute to those who suffered during the war.
	   He also toured Slovenia, also formerly a part of Yugoslavia, but
has not been to Serbia, apparently because of resistance from
Orthodox leaders.

Serbs say they will 'normalize' Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with fresh details, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian authorities, in their latest
move to head off NATO missles and bombs, installed an interim
government in Kosovo Saturday aimed at ``normalizing conditions''
in the rebellious province.
	   Zoran Andjelkovic, the man appointed by the Serbian Parliament
to head the 18-member Interim Executive Council, told the new
members at their first session in the Kosovo Parliament building:
``We have to defeat the terrorists and work for the benefit of all
our citizens.''
	   Meanwhile, the Yugoslav air defense has been placed on the
highest state of alert to counter possible NATO airstrikes, said a
Yugoslav army commander who spoke Saturday on condition of
anonymity.
	   Constituting the new council, moribund since 1989, was part of a
last-ditch effort to show Serbs intend to end the conflict and came
just two days before a report by United Nations chief Kofi Annan on
whether Belgrade is complying with demands to halt its assault on
ethnic Albanians. If not, Washington has indicated NATO airstrikes
will happen within two weeks.
	   Like other moves in recent days, including a pullback of troops
and equipment in Kosovo as well as a series of diplomatic efforts,
the latest drew skepticism.
	   A western diplomat said between 115 and 120 armored vehicles,
including tanks, and armored vehicles of the Yugoslav army have
been pulled out of Kosovo so far.
	   Meanwhile, ethnic Albanian political leaders rejected the
interim council as a ``body formed by Serbian authorities.''
Andjelkovic, after four days of local consultations, appointed
seven Serbs, five Albanians and the rest Turks and Muslims. He said
he consulted no political parties in the process.
	   ``Our task is to normalize conditions as soon as possible and
create conditions for local elections in Kosovo,'' Andjelkovic told
the new council, gathered round a long, polished table. ``I hope we
will not last for a very long time, because that means we will be
successful.''
	   Edita Tahiri, a top ethnic Albanian political leader, condemned
the establishment of the council as ``strengthening Serbian rule in
Kosovo.''
	   ``The act ... is a serious impediment for any success in a
negotiating process,'' she said.
	   The Serbs' efforts to eliminate the separatist Kosovo Liberation
Army in the Serbian province, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian,
has killed hundreds of people and driven an estimated 275,000 from
their homes. Momentum for international leaders to step in has
increased in the past week amid revelations of massacres of ethnic
Albanian civilians in the forests of Kosovo.
	   After a session of the Yugoslav government in Belgrade on
Friday, officials issued a statement saying the fighting had ended
and blaming continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   The province was reported mostly quiet, though there are
continuing scattered reports of gunfire exchanges between Serb
forces and ethnic Albanian militants, and police and military
forces can still be seen in various parts of the province.
	   The Serbs' Media Center reported Saturday that a Yugoslav army
mail truck came came under attack some 20 kilometers (12 miles)
southwest of Pristina late Friday. No one was injured.
	   Serb police took reporters to the site of what they thought was
a mass grave on a mountaintop near the village of Volujak, about 60
kilometers (40 miles) west of Pristina. Dogs, they said, had
unearthed some human bones in an area formerly held by the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   With reporters looking on, police dug up parts of four skeletons
and said from the smell they suspected there were more, but there
was no way to identify the remains or determine their ethnicity and
cause of death without closer forensic investigation.
	   The investigating magistrate at the site, Veselin Cadjenovic,
said early indications were inconclusive.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders have rebuffed a Serb offer to
hold talks, saying Friday that they won't sit down until NATO
intervenes. Low-level talks, which the Serbs say could lead to
restoration of some of the autonomy they took away from Kosovo in
1989, broke off in May.
	   The Serbs also on Friday invited Annan to visit Kosovo, removed
a key police roadblock and showed reporters heavy equipment they
said had been withdrawn.
	   Showing the West is unconvinced, German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said in Copenhagen, Denmark, that the NATO intervention
clock ``is at one minute to 12.'' He stressed that ``no ultimatum,
no date has been set,'' but added: ``Mr. Milosevic must know that
we are serious.''
	   Greece, a NATO member, added its voice meanwhile to those
against airstrikes. Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said
Western powers have blown the Kosovo crisis out of proportion, and
predicted the price of any attack on Serbia would be paid by
neighboring countries in the Balkans.
	   Russia, a staunch Serb ally, also adamantly opposes any military
intervention.

10,000 protest regional leader linked in vote to National Front
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Some 10,000 people demonstrated Saturday against
Charles Millon, more than six months after the former defense
minister was elected president of the Rhone Alpes regional council
with votes from the far right.
	   ``Millon, Get Out. You're polluting the region,'' some
demonstrators shouted, while deriding the anti-immigration National
Front party which helped Millon into office in March regional
elections.
	   The demonstration and march was organized by some 80
associations and individuals, including former Socialist Culture
Minister Jack Lang.
	   Millon was expelled from the centrist Union for French Democracy
after his election. He was one of a handful of centrists who
accepted the support of the National Front to win regional
positions, causing a crisis for France's mainstream right.
	   The National Front, accused of racism and anti-Semitism, has an
approximately 15 percent support rating at election time.
	   Millon, who has refused months of pressure to step down, denies
suggestions he will be forced to espouse National Front policies.
He says instead that the right needs to find ways to reach out to
the thousands of people who vote for the party.

Carter says Basque conflict should be solved without foreign help
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTANDER, Spain (AP) _ Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said
on Saturday that a permanent end to the violence in Spain's
northern Basque region should be negotiated without foreign
interference.
	   ``It is clearly a situation that should be resolved directly by
the Spanish government and the other party,'' Carter told reporters
after receiving the title of ``honored guest'' in this northern
city close to Spain's troubled Basque region.
	   ``Directly and without foreign help,'' Carter added.
	   An unlimited cease-fire called two weeks ago by the armed Basque
separatist group ETA has raised hopes for an end to violence in
Spain's troubled Basque region.
	   Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar promised Friday that he
would initiate a peace process if the truce proves lasting.
	   Carter's comments in Spanish were broadcast on national Spanish
radio. He was due to give a lecture later Saturday on family values
before beginning a vacation in Spain, the radio reported.
	   Despite stressing that foreign interference was not necessary,
Carter did admit parallels between the Basque situation and the
conflict in Northern Ireland where the U.S. has been closely
involved with the peace process, the radio said.
	   ETA, an acronym that stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has
killed nearly 800 people in its 30-year campaign for an independent
homeland straddling northern Spain and southern France.
	   Gerry Adams _ leader of the Sinn Fein party that is allied to
the Irish Republican Army _ is due to visit the Basque region on
Monday on his way to begin a tour of the U.S. Adams has called on
the Spanish government to react quickly and positively to the ETA
truce.

Government claims peace returning to troubled Kashmir
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By QAISER MIRZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ The government claimed Saturday that the
situation in insurgency-wracked Kashmir was ``more relaxed and
comparatively normal'' with tourism picking up and people beginning
to pay taxes after a gap of seven years.
	   A press statement by the local government at the completion of
two years of its rule claimed the killings by Muslim militants have
dropped by 23 percent since 1996 _ to 4,344 from 5,648.
	   ``More than 100,000 tourists visited Kashmir for the first time
this summer since the outbreak of militancy,'' it said.
	   Local residents largely depend on visitors for survival since
the Himalayan territory is considered a tourist paradise. They
suffered the most after the separatist war broke out in 1989 and
the tourist inflow stopped.
	   Movie makers from Bombay, India's film city, also have resumed
capturing the region's dramatic mountains or the Victorian-era
houseboats on Dal Lake.
	   Fighting continues between government forces and the Muslim
rebels in the state, but not as fiercely as in the late 1980s.
Exchange of firing at the disputed India-Pakistan border by the
security forces of two sides is almost a daily occurrence.
	   The government's claim was disputed by Syed Shah Geelani,
chairman of an umbrella organization of separatist groups.''Kashmir
is a ghost valley where people live in fear,'' he said.
	   ``The Indian security forces have killed 5,291 people, burned
down 1,669 homes and raped and molested 135 women in the past two
years,'' claimed Geelani, head of the All Party Hurriyat
Conference.
	   After seven years of direct rule, the Indian government held
local elections in Jammu-Kashmir state in 1996, which was won by
the National Conference, led by Farooq Abdullah. The separatists
had boycotted the voting.
	   Muslims militants in Kashmir are fighting for independence from
India or for merger with neighboring Pakistan, which is officially
Islamic. Kashmir is the only Muslim majority state in
overwhelmingly Hindu India. The insurgency has killed more than
15,000 people since 1989.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the control of
Kashmir since they won independence from British colonialists 51
years ago. India holds two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the rest.
	   Local residents stopped paying taxes and electricity bills after
the separatist war started nine years ago. But they are gradually
responding to the government warning to pay or face the penalty,
officials said.
	   On Saturday, Abdul Rahman Gujri, who runs a shop in Srinagar,
said the local government was bankrupt and there was hardly any
development work in the state. ``A state government check for
rupees 200,000 (dlr. 4,761) given to my son two months ago was yet
to be honored by the bank,'' Gujri said.
	   Mohammed Shafi Uri, the state finance minister, said last week
he was expecting more funds from the federal government. New Delhi
meets the cost of fighting militancy and running the local
administration in the state.

Balkan heads of state meet as NATO ponders strikes in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to RECAST, UPDATE with Simitis saying he
feels not all EU nations agree with military action. No pickup. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DELPHI, Greece (AP) _ Not all European leaders are convinced
that military action is the best way out of the crisis in the
Serbian province of Kosovo, Greek Premier Costas Simitis said
Saturday.
	   Simitis discussed the issue by telephone with his counterparts
Lionel Jospin of France and Romano Prodi of Italy, as well as
German Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder.
	   After the calls, he said he was far from being convinced of the
inevitability of NATO military action.
	   ``I don't have this feeling ... that it is decided and that they
will go ahead. I have the feeling that all are troubled about the
way to best deal with the crisis,'' Simitis said.
	   He spoke in Delphi during the first day of a meeting with the
leaders of Romania and Bulgaria.
	   Earlier, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said Western
powers are blowing the Kosovo crisis out of all proportion, and
neighboring countries will have to pay the price of any military
strikes against the Serbs.
	   ``Many people are taking decisions for what is happening in the
Balkans, but the final price is paid for by the three countries
meeting here,'' Pangalos said.
	   The meeting was being held days before U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan was to submit a report on Yugoslav compliance with a
Security Council resolution that demands an end to the offensive in
Kosovo, the Serbian province which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
Serbia, in turn, is the dominant republic in what remains of
Yugoslavia.
	   The resolution threatens unspecified further action, seen by
many as the decision NATO needs for military intervention.
	   Bulgaria, Romania and Greece support greater autonomy for
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, but disagree with their demand for full
independence, Simitis said. Many other Western powers agree, as
border changes in the Balkans often lead to further bloodshed.
	   All three countries are concerned that the crisis could lead to
a regional war, but their opposition to military intervention stems
from fear of a repetition of the Bosnian war and the sanctions that
harmed their economies.
	   ``Our three countries have an interest and an imperative duty to
contribute with all their strength to ease the crisis which will
have generally unfavorable consequences for all the countries,''
Pangalos said.
	   Simitis noted that European states ``have to take actions if
necessary, positive actions, not negative actions, if they see that
between the countries of the region there is a common will to
overcome problems.''
	   Presidents Petar Stoyanov of Bulgaria and Emil Constantinescu of
Romania also brought up the issue of their application for entry
into the European Union and NATO during the meeting at the ancient
site of Delphi, located on a rocky and forested mountain 180
kilometers (112 miles) north of Athens.
	   Greece, which is a member of both organizations, has been
pushing the candidacies in the hope of increasing stability in the
volatile Balkans.
	   The two countries ``are in a far better position to enter the EU
than many other candidates,'' Simitis said.
	   NATO and EU enlargement must encompass as many countries as
possible, Simitis noted.
	   ``A narrow enlargement would cause further division in the
continent,'' he said. ``The enlargement should be broad based and
should promote security and stability in the whole region.''

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With a global economic crisis looming and
conflicts creating turmoil in more than 30 hotspots, world leaders
came to the United Nations over the past two weeks _ and made some
surprising moves towards easing global tensions.
	   After detonating nuclear devices in May, India and Pakistan
announced plans to adhere to the nuclear test ban treaty within the
next year, which would slow the South Asian arms race.
	   Benjamin Netanyahu announced Israel will shortly hand over 13
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians, and Yasser Arafat
backed down from unilaterallly declaring that a Palestinian state
would be in place by May 4, 1999, the deadline for implementing the
Middle East peace accords.
	   Iran's moderate government distanced itself from a dlrs 2.5
million reward for killing Salman Rushdie, author of ``The Satanic
Verses'' which religious leaders claimed blasphemed Islam,
prompting a positive response from Western ministers.
	   Nigeria's new leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, committed his
military government to fair elections and a return to civilian rule
next year, key Western demands to end the country's pariah status.
	   Still, many of the world's conflicts showed no signs of cooling
down.
	   There was no progress on reunification of Cyprus, divided since
1974 when Turkey occupied the north of the island nation. The
border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea remained tense. Congo
accused neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of invading the country and
massacring thousands of innocent Congolese. Rwanda and Uganda
denied the allegations and blamed Congo for slaughtering innocent
men, women and children.
	   And the threat of NATO military strikes against Serb targets in
Kosovo grew, following the broadcast and publication of gruesome
pictures of massacred ethnic Albanians. Survivors blamed Serb
forces trying to crush independence-seeking ethnic Albanians.
	   The U.N. Security Council on Thursday condemned the massacres,
but didn't assign blame or add any new legal backing for any NATO
action.
	   Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic denied any new
attacks in Kosovo and insisted his country wanted ``direct,
unconditional'' dialogue with the ethnic Albanians _ which they
have rejected _ to resolve the conflict peacefully.
	   Old Cold War opponents still shouted at each other.
	   North Korea, the most rigid remaining communist state, accused
its South Korean rivals of being ``running dogs'' of the Americans.
And the Cubans and Americans volleyed in the assembly debate for
two rounds over the U.S. embargo and the refusal of the Western
hemisphere's only communist state to hold democratic elections.
	   With a new millennium just two years away, many leaders wondered
aloud how the international community can deal with the issues
heaped on the global plate _ from the growing number of conflicts
in Africa to the growing gap between rich and poor and the growing
threat of international terrorism.
	   ``Mankind is increasingly feeling the breathing of the 21st
century,'' said Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
	   Nations will live ``in peace and harmony'' once they recognize
their interdependence and start to seek collective responses to the
challenges of the time, he said.
	   Eager to forge a more collective response, many nations
suggested ways for reforming the U.N. Security Council to make it
more representative of the world _ and more responsive to the needs
of developing countries. But talk of expanding the council _
effectively the U.N. board of directors _ is hopelessly stalled
over who should get to join the exclusive club.
	   And the growth of global financial markets, the inter-linked
national economies and the spreading economic crisis has no easy
solution.
	   ``The poorest countries are the traumatized victims of this
reality; but the whole world community can be threatened by a
situation that will affect even the most advanced countries,''
Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera said.

EDS: UPDATES in 3rd graf with explanation of priests complaints
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Lonely priests seek modern look &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greece's Orthodox priests say their dress
code of long black robes, pipe hats and overgrown beards is ruining
their marriage prospects, local media reported Saturday.
	   ``If the robes create an obstacle for finding a wife, and you
know they do, then the Church's leadership must do something to
modernize our appearance,'' Father Efstathios Kollas, head of the
union of parish priests, said Friday. Out of Greece's 11,000 odd
priests, only 3,000 are married, he said.
	   Orthodox priests are required to wear full clerical garb after
ordination, and Kollas complained that women are often put off by
the prospect of being married to a man who must always be dressed
in black robes.
	   Orthodox Greeks seeking entry to the priesthood as married men
must be wed before being ordained.
	   Kollas also argued that priests' outdated appearance discouraged
educated Greeks from becoming men of the cloth.
	   The priests' plea to shed their head-to-foot robes comes ahead
of a meeting of the Holy Synod, the Greek Church's governing body.
The meeting is scheduled for Tuesday and will be presided over by
the head of the Greek Orthodox Church Archbishop Christodoulos. It
is not yet certain whether Kollas' plea will be discussed at the
ten-day meeting.
	   Since his election as church leader in April, Christodoulos has
argued that it is essential to modernize the church, a bastion of
conservatism, without abandoning its age old traditions. In a
surprise move last month, Christodoulos told young men they could
even wear earrings when they visit their pastors
	   Priests in other Orthodox countries have a similar appearance to
those in Greece. More than 90 percent of all Greeks are baptized
Greek Orthodox, which is the country's official religion.

New Zealand's Turner, Sweden's Jacobson share lead

 &UR; EDS: Stands as 1st Ld-Writethru to European lines to CORRECT
spelling of Jacobson's first name. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KNOKKE, Belgium (AP) _ Greg Turner of New Zealand shot a
4-under-par 67 in cold, damp conditions Saturday to move into a
share of the lead with Sweden's Fredrik Jacobson after the third
round of the Belgian Open.
	   Jacobsen shot a 3-under 69 and was tied at 12-under 201 heading
into Sunday's final round, one storke ahead of England's Lee
Westwood, who matched Turner's 67.
	   Westwood kept alive his chance of overtaking Scotsman Colin
Montgomerie, absent this weekend, for the European tour's Order of
Merit title. Westwood needs a victory Sunday to have an opportunity
for the money title going into the season-ending Volvo Masters.
	   Jacobson, who has been troubled by back pains this week, needs
to finish in the top eight to guarantee his tour card next season.
	   Turner saved his round just after the turn.
	   ``I made a good up and down from the sand at the 11th after
missing the green 30 yards right and I made another from under the
lip at the 14th,'' Turner said. ``They would have been killers if I
had dropped shots there.
	   ``We three leaders have all got great incentives. If Freddie
wins that would be a fantastic story because top five would
probably be as good as a win to him to keep his card. That's
ultimately more important.
	   ``Lee has the significance of the money list chase and I've got
the Presidents Cup. A win here could really boost my chances.''
	   Twelve players for both the United States and non-European
nations will be chosen for the December match-play Presidents Cup.
	   The top 10 for the International team will be determined by the
World Rankings with two wild-card selections by Peter Thomson.
	   Turner is the 17th non-European in the World Rankings heading
into this weekend's event. The teams will be chosen after the Volvo
Masters on Nov. 1.
	   Sweden's Jarmo Sandelin shot 66 and Germany Sven Struver a 67 to
get within two shots of the pace at 10-under.
	   Nick Faldo, who won the Belgian Open when it was last held in
1994, slumped further back on Saturday with a consecutive 72 and
was a in tie at 4 under.

Italian energy company executive doesn't see price increase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ The chief executive of Italy's
state-controlled energy company said Saturday oil prices are not
likely to increase in the short term.
	   ``I personally don't see anything in the coming months or so
that will change the situation,'' said Franco Bernabe, who leads
the oil-and-gas company ENI SpA.
	   A strong growth in demand ``has come to a halt in 1998,'' he
said at a news conference here during a two-day meeting of
representatives from oil companies from various nations.
	   ``I think that things will stay where they are for some period
of time, at least until the moment in which a global strategy is
defined for a recovery,'' Bernabe added.

<TEXT>
	   MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) _ Uruguayan Vice President Hugo Batalla
has died of lung cancer at a Montevideo hospital, medical
authorities said. He was 72.
	   The government decreed a day of mourning for Batalla, who died
Friday, and said that Senator Hugo Fernandez Faingold will be named
vice president until the term ends next year.
	   Batalla, a lawyer, was several times deputy and senator before
and after Uruguay's 1972-1984 military dictatorship.
	   He was decorated by the French government for his defense of
political prisoners during that time.
	   Batalla presided over the Uruguayan Football Association during
the qualifiers for the USA 94 World Cup and resigned after Uruguay
was eliminated.
	   He is survived by his wife, Hilda Flores Olivera, and a
daughter.

New Zealand's Mark Todd leads three-day event after cross-country
</HEADLINE>
test &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Olympic champion Mark Todd of New Zealand moved atop
the three-day event standings at the World Equestrian Games
Saturday after riding flawlessly in the speed and endurance tests.
	   On bay Broadcast News, Todd took over the lead from Germany's
Bettina Overesch, who achieved the top honors in the first day's
dressage test. Overesch, who rides grey Watermill Stream, has 39.2
penalties to Todd's 34.
	   Todd's score, combined with that of his three teammates --
including a fourth place by 1990 winner Blyth Tait and a 10th place
by defending champion Vaughn Jefferis -- helped put New Zealand in
first place in the team three-day event standings.
	   Australia is currently in second, followed by France. The United
States, in fourth with just 2.8 penalties behind France, is well
positioned for a medal.
	   At the Atlanta Olympics, the Americans claimed the silver in the
discipline while New Zealand took the bronze. Australia won.
	   David O'Connor of The Plains, Va. was the United States' top
rider, finishing 11th on Giltedge with 51.4 penalties. Two-time
World champion Bruce Davidson of Unionsville, Pa. finished 12th on
Heyday.
	   Saturday's speed and endurance tests are considered the most
difficult portion of the three-day event for both horses and
riders. The discipline concludes Sunday with show jumping.
	   Germany's Isabel Werth, the 1996 Olympic dressage champion, is
atop the provisional standings in the individual dressage and will
be aiming to hold onto her lead Sunday in the event's final test,
the Free Style.
	   The Netherlands' Anky Van Grunsven, the Olympic silver medalist,
is close on Werth's heels.
	   Werth on Thursday helped Germany win the team dressage title,
which it also won at the summer Games. The United States placed
fourth.
	   About 700 horses and 550 riders and drivers from 42 countries
will compete in the championships, held at three separate venues,
which run through Oct. 11. Eleven titles will be assigned in five
disciplines, including the Olympic events of dressage,
three-day-event and jumping.

Miners agree to end protest outside Russian government building
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Coal miners have agreed to end a nearly four-month
around-the-clock protest outside the Russian government
headquarters, news agencies reported Saturday.
	   The miners said they have reached agreement with the government
on a schedule for repaying overdue wages.
	   The protest that began June 11 will end Monday, said Alexander
Sergeyev, leader of the miners' union.
	   ``There will be no banners of the miners' independent trade
union in Moscow after Oct. 5,'' Sergeyev said.
	   About 50 miners have been camping outside the government
building known as the White House. There were as many as 200 during
the summer, but their numbers dwindled as the protest dragged on
the weather turned colder.
	   Besides demanding their overdue wages, they also called for
President Boris Yeltsin's resignation.
	   The new government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has said
that paying overdue wages and pensions _ a chronic problem in
Russia _ is a priority, although it is not clear where the money
will be found.

Yugoslav air defense placed on alert to counter NATO

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - The Yugoslav air defense has been
placed on the highest state of alert to counter possible NATO
airstrikes, but their commanders admit they cannot fight against
U.S. cruise missile attacks, media reported Saturday.
	   NATO strategists have said they are considering using cruise
missiles, followed by a wave of airstrikes, to take out Serb air
defenses to stop ethnic turmoil in Kosovo and force Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to negotiate a solution with ethnic
Albanian separatists.
	   Active Yugoslav military officers are banned from speaking to
foreign media on the record, but they sometimes agree to to give
statements on condition of anonymity.
	   One top air defense commander told The Associated Press ``we are
virtually defenseless against low-flying cruise missile attacks,
but we can inflict a lot of harm to NATO in case of their plane
attacks.''
	   He said air defenses throughout Yugoslavia had been placed on
the highest state of alert, and some mobile surface-to-air units
have been deployed to the possible target sites.
	   The air defense commander said those include four main military
airports in Yugoslavia: Batajnica (near Belgrade), Pristina (in
Kosovo), Podgorica (in Montenegro) and Nis (central Serbia).
Reporters saw old Soviet-made SA-2 anti-aircraft rockets being
moved to near Pristina airport Saturday.
	   Yugoslavia is comprised of Serbia and smaller Montenegro
republics. Kosovo is a Serbian province, where ethnic Albanians
account for 90 percent of the 2 million inhabitants.
	   The Yugoslav army suspects initial attacks would try to take out
anti-aircraft radar centers, which are crucial support for the
Yugoslav fighters. Absence of the centers would make any further
attacks much easier.
	   Yugoslav military sources said that in preparing for the
possible attacks, the Yugoslav Air Force has parked most of its
sophisticated aircraft in underground hangars which were built in
anticipation of possible Soviet strikes in the 1960s.
	   In addition to vintage Soviet systems, the Yugoslav air defense
is equipped with highly mobile, radar-equipped and upgraded SA-10
(Igla) short-range anti-aircraft rockets. Also, the Yugoslav Air
Force has sophisticated Russian-made MiG-29s which can outclass
many Western fighters.
	   Serbian leaders, including Vice Premier Vojislav Seselj, have
warned against NATO strikes or deployment, indicating they were
ready to take hostage foreign diplomats and journalists and ``shoot
down any NATO plane or kill and NATO soldier who is within our
reach.''
	   Seselj indicated that some 35,000 peacekeeping troops in
neighboring Bosnia, including 8,500 U.S. soldiers, would face
retaliatory attacks as well from Bosnian Serbs.
	   Having the home advantage could also work in their favor, the
Yugoslav general told the Belgrade media.
	   ``We have the psychological advantage because we defend our
country,'' he said. ``Also, the public in the West does not want to
see losses `bigger than acceptable' in such operations.''

Agassi outlasts Kucera in five-set marathon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rios winning &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Andre Agassi saved four match points and
won the last 11 games of the match to beat a tiring Karol Kucera in
five sets Saturday and will play Marcelo Rios in the final of the
Grand Slam Cup.
	   Agassi won 7-6 (7-1), 6-7 (5-7), 2-6, 7-5, 6-0 in a match that
lasted three hours and 40 minutes.
	   ``I wasn't expecting that one today, that's for sure,'' Agassi
said. ``It was real good tennis, there's no question about it. To
win that one in five sets certainly was very satisfying.''
	   ``He is a great player and a great competitor'' Agassi said of
Kucera.
	   Rios, at No. 3 the highest-ranked player in the dlrs 6.7 million
tournament, came back from a break down in the third set to beat
Mark Philippoussis 7-6 (7-4), 6-3, 6-4.
	   Agassi trailed 5-2 in the fourth set and Kucera served for the
match.
	   But the Slovak was unable to convert four match points as his
errors combined with some spectacular and risky shot-making by
Agassi.
	   Kucera sent a forehand into the net to drop the game and Agassi
gained the momentum, winning 11 games in a row to close out the
match.
	   ``He started stretching his legs early in the fourth set. He was
getting very tired.
	   ``I felt if I could just get back into it, I certainly liked my
chances,'' Agassi said.
	   As Kucera began to cramp, Agassi took full advantage of the
opportunity and never let up the pressure, keeping a visibly tiring
Kucera constantly on the move.
	   Kucera was unable to keep with up with Agassi's pace and his
game collapsed.
	   During changeovers, Kucera had his legs massaged by a trainer
and he offered little resistance in the final set.
	   Kucera said he was feeling tired already after the first set.
	   ``But from 5-2 in the fourth, it was really bad,'' he said. ``I
tried to keep the rallies as short as possible. I couldn't really
run too much.''
	   While Kucera had 18 aces, he also had 16 double-faults,
including one on set point in the fourth and on match point. He
also had 76 unforced errors. Agassi had seven aces and only four
double-faults.
	   Agassi could have made things easier for himself had he won the
second set, for which he served twice.
	   The last time Agassi came back from a match point to win the
match, he said, was at the 1994 Canadian Open against David
Wheaton.
	   Agassi took some measure of revenge for his five-set loss to
Kucera in the Round of 16 in last month's U.S. Open.
	   The American was a wild-card entry in the tournament that
nominally brings together players with the best records in the four
Grand Slam events of the year _ the Australian, French and U.S.
Open and Wimbledon.
	   After the withdrawal of top-ranked Pete Sampras and No. 2
Patrick Rafter, organizers invited Agassi although his Grand Slam
record this year was not good enough to earn him a direct spot in
the 12-man field.
	   Now, he could end up earning dlrs 1.3 million by winning the
title. The losing men's finalist will get dlrs 650,000.
	   Kucera is enjoying the best year of his career. He was a
semifinalist in the Australian Open after beating Sampras and a
quarterfinalist in the U.S. Open, rising to No. 6 in the rankings.
	   Agassi has won four tournaments on the ATP Tour this year,
although he never got past the Round of 16 at any of the four Grand
Slams.
	   But he has come out of a deep slump during which he had dropped
out of the top 100. A former No. 1, Agassi is now ranked No. 8.
	   He beat the only Grand Slam champion here, Australian Open
winner Petr Korda, in the quarterfinals, remaining the only former
Grand Slam champion in the draw.
	   Agassi has three Grand Slam title, 1992 Wimbledon, 1994 U.S.
Open and 1995 Australian Open.
	   The big-serving Philippoussis struggled against Rios although
this tournament is played on the same hard-court surface as the
U.S. Open, where Philippoussis was the losing finalist.
	   Rios, down 3-0 in the third set, used some spectacular passing
shots to break the Australian's serve twice in a row.
	   The Chilean fired an ace to end the match after one hour, 42
minutes and will be the fresher man going into the final.

Jamaica files suit against ship that allegedly dumped drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The Jamaican government filed suit
against the operators of a Dutch-registered vessel that authorities
believe caused a massive fish kill in Kingston harbor by dumping
drugs overboard.
	   The lawsuit, filed Friday, alleged that the captain and crew
dumped amphetamines into the water when the vessel began sinking.
Samples from dead fish showed traces of the drug, the suit states.
	   When the incident occurred in April, the crew told local
authorities that only sugar was dumped overboard.
	   After an investigation was launched, the captain and crew fled
the island, the lawsuit states.
	   Dumping the toxic materials allegedly violated several Jamaican
laws designed to protect wildlife.

<TEXT>
	   LEVERKUSEN, Germany (AP) _ The Bundesliga's leading scorer, Olaf
Marschall, said Saturday that injuries will force him to miss
Germany's upcoming key European Championship qualifiers against
Turkey and Moldavia.
	   Erich Ribbeck, making his debut as Germany's national team
coach, had planned to start the lanky forward in the Oct. 10 match

New day-long military service program gets underway
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEAN-MARIE GODARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VINCENNES, France (AP) _ Some 14,000 young men on Saturday
inaugurated a new form of boot camp -- a day of civic education
that is France's answer to military duty.
	   The system, which is to progressively replace national service
as France moves to a professional army, was instituted a year ago,
but did not take effect until Saturday.
	   The Defense Ministry said that 93 percent of the men convoked
showed up at 220 sites around France for the 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
``Call to Preparation for Defense.''
	   It replaces a 10-month program of obligatory military duty.
	   Both young men and women must spend a day of their lives in the
program, a highlight of which is test-taking to spot the nation's
illiterate youth and provide programs to help them.
	   ``The end of military service doesn't mean the end of all ties
between youths and the army,'' said President Jacques Chirac during
a visit to one site, Fort Neuf de Vincennes, on the southeast edge
of Paris.
	   ``The object of this day is to make you understand that the army
is one of the most noble and necessary institutions of the
nation.''
	   The conscripts-for-a-day listened to lectures on such things as
``The Stakes of Defense'' and ``The Global Politics of Defense and
the Changing Role of the Armed Forces.'' They also saw a film:
``The Duty of Memory.''
	   The French military is to be totally professional by the year
2002.
	   Those participating receive a certificate at day's end --
necessary to sign up for their final high school exam.
	   The next session is to be held in a week.

U.S. diplomats leave embassy in Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The last diplomats have left the U.S. Embassy in
Tajikistan, where work has been suspended because of concerns about
terrorism, a news agency said Saturday.
	   A group of embassy employees led by charge d'affaires Patricia
Celpepper left for a neighboring Central Asian country, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   The United States announced in September that it was temporarily
closing its embassy in Tajikistan following an international
reassessment of embassy security conducted after bombings of U.S.
embassies in Africa.
	   The embassy in Tajikistan is located in a hotel in central
Dushanbe. Tajikistan has been torn by violence between the
government and its political opposition, with fighting reaching the
outskirts of the capital on occasion.
	   Tajikistan also is adjacent to Afghanistan, which the United
States has accused of harboring Osama bin Laden, the man suspected
of masterminding the bombings at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.

New Zealand's Todd leads three-day event after cross-country test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Olympic champion Mark Todd of New Zealand moved atop
the three-day event standings at the World Equestrian Games
Saturday after riding flawlessly in the cross-country test.
	   On bay Broadcast News, Todd took over the lead from Germany's
Bettina Overesch, who achieved the top honors in the first day's
dressage test. Overesch, who rides grey Watermill Stream, has 39.2
penalties to Todd's 34.
	   Todd's score, combined with that of his three teammates _
including a fourth place by 1990 winner Blyth Tait and a 10th place
by defending champion Vaughn Jefferis _ helped put New Zealand on
top of the three-day event team standings.
	   Australia was in second, followed by France. The United States,
in fourth with just 2.8 penalties behind France, is well positioned
for a medal.
	   Saturday's speed and endurance tests are considered the most
difficult portion of the three-day event for both horses and
riders. The discipline concludes Sunday with show jumping.
	   Germany's Isabel Werth, the 1996 Olympic dressage champion, is
atop the provisional standings in the individual dressage and will
be aiming to hold onto her lead Sunday in the event's final test,
the Free Style.
	   The Netherlands' Anky Van Grunsven, the Olympic silver medalist,
is close on Werth's heels.
	   Werth on Thursday helped Germany win the team dressage title,
which it also won at the summer Games.
	   About 700 horses and 550 riders and drivers from 42 countries
will compete in the championships, held at three separate venues,
which run through Oct. 11. Eleven titles will be assigned in five
disciplines, including the Olympic events of dressage,
three-day-event and jumping.

Germany's upcoming key European Championship qualifiers against

	   The lanky FC Kaiserslautern forward will be forced out of both

	   New German national team coach Erich Ribbeck, making his debut

	   Marschall, third on the team's forward depth chart behind Oliver

Meciar stays party chairman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar will
remain chairman of his party, despite a poor showing in last week's
parliamentary elections, the party congress decided Saturday.
	   At an emergency meeting Saturday, called after Meciar's Movement
for a Democratic Slovakia, failed to garner enough votes to stay in
power, the party decided to keep the out-going premier at its head.
	   The party also announced newly elected parliamentarian Jan
Smerek would represent them in discussions on the new government.
	   Meciar announced on Wednesday that he was stepping down from
politics and would resign from his position in the parliament.
There were questions about him leaving the post of party chairman
as well, but congress decided against changing the party's
leadership.
	   ``The Movement without Meciar is meaningless,'' said Slovak
Interior Minister Gustav Krajci on Saturday.
	   Some members did not like the fact that the party did not hold
anyone responsible for the poor election results, deciding instead
to wait until the next regular congress is held in April 1999 to
rule on this.
	   Ivan Mjartan, former Slovak Ambassador to the Czech Republic and
top representative in the party did not show up at the congress,
but told independent radio Twist he was resigning from his position
and would leave the party in a few days. He gave no reasons for his
resignation and did not say if others would follow him.
	   Opposition parties won a total 93 in balloting held last Friday
and Saturday, giving them a constitutional majority in parliament.
	   The democratic movement declared Saturday, it planned to be a
strong opposition party in the new government.
	   The new parliament is to be called into session by Oct. 29.

Cardoso's appeal intact despite Brazil's economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso says he has no magic solution for Brazil's worst economic
crisis since the country went broke in 1982. Yet voters somehow
seem under his spell.
	   Cardoso led Brazil into a time of stagnation and record
unemployment. If re-elected, he promises spending cuts and more
taxes.
	   And he is the overwhelming favorite to win another four-year
term on Sunday, when Brazilians also choose 27 governors, all 513
federal deputies, a third of the 81-seat Senate and 1,045 state
legislators.
	   All polls have indicated the 67-year-old sociologist has enough
support to win.
	   A survey conducted last week by the prestigious Ibope polling
institute gave Cardoso 47 percent of the vote to 24 percent for
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the leftist Workers Party. The survey
of 3,000 people nationwide had a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.
	   Voting is compulsory for Brazilians between 18 and 70.
	   For the first time, more than half of Brazil's 106 million
registered voters will use electronic voting machines instead of
paper ballots. The electronic votes will be tallied in 24 hours,
but the rest won't be counted until Friday, electoral officials
say.
	   Though Cardoso was expected to prevail, Brazilians are less
certain about how he will see the world's ninth-largest economy
through its economic crisis. Market panic that battered Asia and
Russia is aimed squarely at Brazil.
	   Investors are pulling their money out of the country, fearing
the government won't obtain financing for its huge budget deficit
of nearly 70 billion reals (dlrs 60 billion) _ more than 7 percent
of gross domestic product.
	   Hard-currency reserves, once a cushion against speculation,
plunged from dlrs 74 billion in April to dlrs 45 billion last week.
	   Finance Minister Pedro Malan has been negotiating an emergency
loan package reportedly worth dlrs 30 billion with the
International Monetary Fund and other public and private lenders.
	   The austerity cuts Brazilians can expect would be severe. Cuts
in public spending could hurt crumbling health and school systems.
Industry and the middle class are bracing for higher taxes.
Pressure is growing for a devaluation of the real.
	   Unemployment, which unions calculate at 18 percent, is expected
to worsen. Cardoso's early campaign promise to create 7.8 million
jobs is all but forgotten. ``No magic can resolve this overnight,''
Cardoso said recently. ``We must be clear about our limits.''
	   His rivals have tried to blame the crisis on the anti-inflation
plan Cardoso drafted as finance minister in 1994. Its quick early
success propelled him to the presidency that year on the first
ballot.
	   But reforms to cut spending bogged down in Congress while
Cardoso spent precious time pushing through a constitutional
amendment allowing his own re-election.
	   Lula, however, has failed to convince Brazilians he can do
better. And the elimination of chronic sky-high inflation remains a
powerful persuader.
	   ``The road to stability demands sacrifice,'' said Maria Ferreira
da Silva, a real estate broker. She supports Cardoso, although her
sales have nose-dived in recent months.
	   ``He's being sincere,'' she said. ``We must first tighten belts
to improve later on. I have hope.''

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Latvans were narrowly approving their
parliament's contrversial moves to make citizenship easier for the
country's hundreds of thousands of stateless Russians, early
results from a referendum showed.
	   With votes counteed from about 5 percent of the country's
precincts, the changes were being approved by a 52-45 margin. The
remainder apparently were blank or spoiled ballots.
	   If the acceptance is borne out in the final results, Latvia will
have headed off an unpleasant confrontation with the West. But
whether the results would mollify Russia, which has rained
denunciations on Latvia for its treatment of ethnic Russians, is in
doubt.
	   Although the law changes remove years of waiting for citizenship
applicants, the laws still require adults to have competence in
Latvia, which many who grew up in all-Russian communities within
Latvia regard as unreasonable.
	   The referendum held in conjunction with voting for the country's
100-seat Saeima parliament asked voters if they want to reject
liberalizing citizenship law amendments that the parliament passed
in June.
	   The amendments were passed after a tense spring in which Russia
threatened trade sanctions against its diminutive neighbor and
unleashed outraged statements including Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov's
characterizing Latvia as committing genocide.
	   Latvia was also under pressure from the West to change the laws.
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said the
laws violated its principles and many officials predicted that the
European Union, which Latvia ardently wants to join, would never
let the country in unless it lowered the obstacles to citizenship.
	   But after the amendments were passed, a referendum drive to
overturn them began, spearheaded by nationalist politicians who
claim Latvian national identity is imperiled.
	   After Latvia became independent of the Soviet Union in 1991,
citizenship was granted to ethnic Latvians and to anyone who had
lived there prior to the Soviet annexation in 1940.
	   That left out the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians who
poured into Latvia during Soviet rule, and to their children even
if born in Latvia. Today, about 452,000 of the country's 740,000
ethnic Russians are without citizenship.
	   Because they can't vote, they regarded Saturday's referendum
with angry resignation.
	   ``I was born in Riga, I live in Riga, but I am Russian and can't
vote. I don't like it here,'' said a young woman who gave her name
only as Alex, selling cassettes in the vast market that sprawls in
and around five old dirigible hangars on the outskirts of downtown.
	   But many people who could vote were annoyed because the
referendum question was phrased confusingly: a ``yes'' vote meaning
``no'' to the changes.
	   ``Frankly, I didn't understand the issue or the ballot,'' said
79-yar-old Dzetins Alois, who voted in the parliamentary election
but not in the referendum.
	   Some voting irregularities were reported, including President
Guntis Ulmanis giving a television interview inside a polling
station, and a polling place in the city of Jurmala failing to
stamp about 200 ballots properly.
	   Of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats in the Saeima
(pronounced SIGH-mah), the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party
of Prime Minister Guntars Krasts was the only major party
campaigning to turn down the changes.
	   On issues other than citizenship, like the need to seek EU and
NATO membership, there is wide agreement among the parties. There
is also broad support for the free-market reforms that have raised
Latvia up from the stagnant Soviet era.
	   Voter support for one party or another appeared to depend as
much on the personality of leaders as on specific issues.
	   The party that was No. 1 in most pre-election polls with around
20 percent support is the center-right Peoples Party, a new party
founded by wealthy businessman and a former prime minister, Andris
Skele.
	   Skele has said Latvia relies too much on transit trade to and
from Russia, and said policies should also focus on producing goods
in Latvia for export.

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Latvians were narrowly approving their
parliament's controversial moves to make citizenship easier for the
country's hundreds of thousands of stateless Russians, early
results from a referendum showed.
	   With votes counteed from about 5 percent of the country's
precincts, the changes were being approved by a 52-45 margin. The
remainder apparently were blank or spoiled ballots.
	   If the acceptance is borne out in the final results, Latvia will
have headed off an unpleasant confrontation with the West. But
whether the results would mollify Russia, which has rained
denunciations on Latvia for its treatment of ethnic Russians, is in
doubt.
	   Although the changes remove years of waiting for citizenship
applicants, the laws still require adults to have competence in
Latvian, which many who grew up in all-Russian communities within
Latvia regard as unreasonable.

Israel says it will stay out of Turkey-Syria dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is not involved in any way in the
current, growing confrontations between Turkey and Syria, a
spokesman said Saturday.
	   ``Israel is not a part of this dispute and is not involved in it
in any way,'' said Defense Ministry spokesman Avi Benayahu.
	   Turkey has amassed troops on the border with Syria and warned of
a military confrontation following allegations that Syria is
supporting Turkish Kurdish rebels.
	   Damascus in respoonse has accused Turkey and Israel of
contriving against Syria through their increased military
cooperation.
	   Israel and Turkey signed military accords in 1996 that outline
joint defense maneuvers and grant Israel the use of Turkish air
space.
	   Israeli experts say they doubt the relations with Turkey are
such that either army would defend the other in the event of
confrontations with a third party.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A Muslim refugee was killed
when he stepped on a landmine while cleaning out the shell of his
destroyed house, officials said Saturday.
	   Hasan Palic, 45, died Friday in village of Siprage in Kotor
Varos region of the Serb republic, some 25 kilometers (15 miles)
northeast of Banja Luka, said Semko Lozic, a representative
refugees who are trying to return.
	   Palic was one of about 2,500 Muslim refugees from Kotor Varos
who are now living in the Muslim-Croat part of Bosnia and visit
their pre-war homes regularly to being preparing them for a future
return.
	   Two other Muslims were also injured in the explosion, Lozic
said.
	   Millions of land mines are strewn across Bosnia. Mine explosions
kill and injure dozens of people every month, and minefields render
stretches of land along the former front line unusable.

 &UR; Mubarak to visit Syria, Turkey to ease military tensions &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mubarak to visit Syria and Turkey; CHANGES

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
will go to Syria and Turkey to help cool tensions between the two
countries, which appear to be edging toward a military conflict, a
top Egyptian official said Saturday.
	   Mubarak ``will head within the next few hours to Syria and
Turkey to hold discussions,'' Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said in
Riyadh where Mubarak met with Saudi King Fahd earlier.
	   Turkey has reportedly massed troops and armored vehicles along
its border with Syria after stepping up its accusations in recent
days that Syria is supporting Turkish Kurdish rebels. Syria denies
sheltering the rebels.
	   Also Saturday, Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said his
forces would soon carry out an exercise near the Syrian border.
	   Moussa told The Associated Press that the talks with Presidents
Hafez Assad of Syria and Suleyman Demirel of Turkey will be to
``control the latest crisis and to avoid continuous escalation,
especially from the Turkish side.''
	   He did not specify when the visits will begin. However, Egyptian
diplomats in Syria said Mubarak is not expected to arrive on
Saturday, indicating that he will begin his peace mission early
Sunday.
	   The visits appear to be last-minute decisions. Just before
flying to Riyadh earlier Saturday, Moussa told reporters in Cairo
that Mubarak was planning to call Demirel by telephone on Sunday.
	   The sudden announcement about the unscheduled trip indicated the
seriousness of the situation on the Turkish-Syrian border where any
fighting is likely to further disrupt an already volatile Middle
East.
	   Mubarak indicated this in his comments to Egyptian reporters
aboard the plane that flew him and Moussa to Riyadh for his
two-hour meeting with the Saudi king to discuss regional problems.
	   ``We have to stop the tension and contain it, and military
threats should stop. I am ready to exert every effort in this
direction in Damascus and Ankara,'' Mubarak said.
	   ``Turkey is a brotherly country to all of us and any military
act between it and Syria is not acceptable,'' he was quoted as
saying by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
	   Earlier Saturday, Mubarak called Assad on phone and also
conveyed a message to Demirel through Turkey's ambassador to Egypt,
Yaser Yakis, Moussa said.
	   Moussa said he told Yakis that ``the situation in the Middle
East cannot endure additional tension, particularly if it is
unnecessary and there are political and diplomatic means to resolve
it.''
	   Turkey says the Kurdish rebels carry out cross-border attacks
from bases in Syria, Iraq and Iran. It also claims the rebels'
headquarters are based in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of
Lebanon and that their leader, Abdullah Ocalan, lives in the Syrian
capital Damascus.
	   For its part, Syria accuses Ankara of forming a military
alliance with Israel that threatens the security of Arab countries.

Moscow mayor says he's ready to lead center-left party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said Saturday that he is
prepared to lead a new center-left political party in Russia if no
other candidate is found, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Luzhkov, who also says he is prepared to run for president of
Russia in 2000, has been calling for the formation of a Social
Democratic party. Russia currently has no such party, although the
Yabloko group often espouses some of the same ideas.
	   Luzhkov spoke after inspecting the construction site for an art
school.

Blair to question China on human rights, newspaper says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair has said that he will
question China's Communist regime over its human rights record
during his visit to the country, Sunday Business newspaper
reported.
	   ``There is no point in denying we have our differences with
China: over political and civil rights, over Tibet, over freedom of
speech, the treatment of dissent, religious freedom, the importance
of democracy,'' Sunday Business quoted Blair as saying in an
article in the newspaper attributed to the prime minister.
	   Blair departs Monday on his five-day visit to China and the
former British colony of Hong Kong, which reverted to Chinese rule
on July 1, 1997.
	   ``Britain and China have very different backgrounds and
traditions. I admire China's rich history and many achievements,''
the newspaper quoted Blair as saying in the article. ``But I also
believe that human rights are universal. This is bound to be
discussed of course when I meet China's leaders.''
	   Blair will also talk about the Asian financial crisis, Hong Kong
and international terrorism when he meets Premier Zhu Rongji, his
office has said.
	   The British leader was quoted as saying by the newspaper that
the main purpose of his visit is to ``forge a new partnership for
the future'' between Britain and China.
	   ``I do not intend to lecture or play to the gallery. I want
progress, not grandstanding,'' the newspaper quoted Blair as
saying. ``I have said before and I still believe that persuasion
and dialogue achieve more than confrontation and empty rhetoric.
The peace process in Northern Ireland shows that talking can
reconcile the seemingly irreconcilable.''
	   On Tuesday Blair will meet Chinese leaders for an official
greeting in Tiananmen Square, scene of the 1989 government
crackdown on student protesters.
	   Human rights campaigners and critics in the West have accused
China of repressing dissent in Tibet, imprisoning dissidents, using
forced prison labor and lacking religious freedom and a free press.
	   John Major, the last British prime minister, visited China in
1990.

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
will go to Syria and Turkey to help cool tensions between the two
countries, which appear to be edging toward a military conflict, a
top Egyptian official said Saturday.
	   Mubarak ``will head within the next few hours to Syria and
Turkey to hold discussions,'' Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said in
Riyadh where Mubarak met with Saudi King Fahd earlier.
	   Turkey has reportedly massed troops and armored vehicles along
its border with Syria after stepping up its accusations in recent
days that Syria is supporting Turkish Kurdish rebels.
	   Syria denies sheltering the rebels and in a government statement
Saturday confirmed ``its keenness for good neighborly relations
with Turkey'' as well as its readiness to solve every issue through
``diplomatic ways, in an atmosphere of trust.''
	   Earlier Saturday, Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said his
forces would soon carry out an exercise near the Syrian border.

Israel says it will stay out of Turkey-Syria dispute

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is not involved in any way in the
current, growing confrontations between Turkey and Syria, a
spokesman said Saturday.
	   ``Israel is not a part of this dispute and is not involved in it
in any way,'' said Defense Ministry spokesman Avi Benayahu.
	   Turkey has amassed troops on the border with Syria and warned of
a military confrontation following allegations that Syria is
supporting Turkish Kurdish rebels.
	   Damascus in respoonse has accused Turkey and Israel of
contriving against Syria through their increased military
cooperation.
	   Israel and Turkey signed military accords in 1996 that outline
joint defense maneuvers and grant Israel the use of Turkish air
space.
	   Israeli experts say they doubt the relations with Turkey are
such that either army would defend the other in the event of
confrontations with a third party.

Early results: Latvians approve contoversial eased citizenship for
</HEADLINE>
Russians &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout results from 16 percent of the voting
stations.
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Latvans were narrowly approving their
parliament's controversial moves to make citizenship easier for the
country's hundreds of thousands of stateless Russians, early
results from a referendum showed.
	   With votes counteed from about 16 percent of the country's
precincts, the changes were being approved by a 53-46 margin. The
remainder apparently were blank or spoiled ballots.
	   If the acceptance is borne out in the final results, Latvia will
have headed off an unpleasant confrontation with the West. But
whether the results would mollify Russia, which has rained
denunciations on Latvia for its treatment of ethnic Russians, is in
doubt.
	   Although the law changes remove years of waiting for citizenship
applicants, the laws still require adults to have competence in
Latvia, which many who grew up in all-Russian communities within
Latvia regard as unreasonable.
	   The referendum held in conjunction with voting for the country's
100-seat Saeima parliament asked voters if they want to reject
liberalizing citizenship law amendments that the parliament passed
in June.
	   The amendments were passed after a tense spring in which Russia
threatened trade sanctions against its diminutive neighbor and
unleashed outraged statements including Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov's
characterizing Latvia as committing genocide.
	   Latvia was also under pressure from the West to change the laws.
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said the
laws violated its principles and many officials predicted that the
European Union, which Latvia ardently wants to join, would never
let the country in unless it lowered the obstacles to citizenship.
	   But after the amendments were passed, a referendum drive to
overturn them began, spearheaded by nationalist politicians who
claim Latvian national identity is imperiled.
	   After Latvia became independent of the Soviet Union in 1991,
citizenship was granted to ethnic Latvians and to anyone who had
lived there prior to the Soviet annexation in 1940.
	   That left out the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians who
poured into Latvia during Soviet rule, and to their children even
if born in Latvia. Today, about 452,000 of the country's 740,000
ethnic Russians are without citizenship.
	   Because they can't vote, they regarded Saturday's referendum
with angry resignation.
	   ``I was born in Riga, I live in Riga, but I am Russian and can't
vote. I don't like it here,'' said a young woman who gave her name
only as Alex, selling cassettes in the vast market that sprawls in
and around five old dirigible hangars on the outskirts of downtown.
	   But many people who could vote were annoyed because the
referendum question was phrased confusingly: a ``yes'' vote meaning
``no'' to the changes.
	   ``Frankly, I didn't understand the issue or the ballot,'' said
79-year-old Dzetins Alois, who voted in the parliamentary election
but not in the referendum.
	   Some voting irregularities were reported, including President
Guntis Ulmanis giving a television interview inside a polling
station, and a polling place in the city of Jurmala failing to
stamp about 200 ballots properly.
	   Of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats in the Saeima
(pronounced SIGH-mah), the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party
of Prime Minister Guntars Krasts was the only major party
campaigning to turn down the changes.
	   On issues other than citizenship, like the need to seek EU and
NATO membership, there is wide agreement among the parties. There
is also broad support for the free-market reforms that have raised
Latvia up from the stagnant Soviet era.
	   Voter support for one party or another appeared to depend as
much on the personality of leaders as on specific issues.
	   In the early results, the new center-right Peoples Party was at
the top with 26 percent. Party leader Andris Skele has said Latvia
relies too much on transit trade to and from Russia, and said
policies should also focus on producing goods in Latvia for export.
	   The conservative Latvia's Way had 23 percent, followed by the
Union of Social Democrats, Fatherland and Freedom and the New
Party.

France says it's not interested without stars

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A French soccer official says his country is
not interested in participating in the Confederations Cup next year
if it will have to play without its frontline players.
	   The warning was made by French Football Federation vice
president Jean Verbeke upon his arrival late Friday with coach
Henri Emile to take part in the draw Sunday for the Jan. 8-20,
1999, tournament.
	   Many European leagues have recently said its clubs will not
release its star players for the tournament because it conflict
with their schedule.
	   FIFA has amended its rules for the Confederations Cup, saying
club teams need only release players for national team duty 48
hours before the tournament.
	   FIFA President Joseph Blatter had planned to attend Sunday's
draw here, but canceled the trip at the last minute for health
reasons.
	   ``We cannot just come with a team that is a world champion
without including its stars,'' Verbeke told reporters. ``Otherwise
we just won't come. If FIFA does not impose a decision, our
participation will be compromised.''
	   National teams from Brazil, France, the United States, Bolivia,
Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Egypt and the winner of the Oceania Nations
Cup, to be decided on Sunday between New Zealand and Australia,
will take part in the Confederations Cup.

Union, which Latvia ardently wants to join, would never let the
country in unless it lowered the obstacles to citizenship.
	   But after the amendments were passed, a referendum drive to
overturn them began, spearheaded by nationalist politicians who
claim Latvian national identity is imperiled.
	   After Latvia became independent of the Soviet Union in 1991,
citizenship was granted to ethnic Latvians and to anyone who had
lived there prior to the Soviet annexation in 1940.
	   That left out the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians who
poured into Latvia during Soviet rule, and to their children _ even
those born in Latvia. Today, about 452,000 of the country's 740,000
ethnic Russians are without citizenship.
	   Because they can't vote, they regarded Saturday's referendum
with angry resignation.
	   ``I was born in Riga, I live in Riga, but I am Russian and can't
vote. I don't like it here,'' said a young woman who gave her name
only as Alex, selling cassettes in the vast market sprawling on the
outskirts of downtown.
	   But many people who could vote were annoyed because the
referendum question was phrased confusingly: a ``yes'' vote meaning
``no'' to the changes.
	   ``Frankly, I didn't understand the issue or the ballot,'' said
79-year-old Dzetins Alois, who voted in the parliamentary election
but not in the referendum.
	   Some voting irregularities were reported, including President
Guntis Ulmanis giving a television interview inside a polling
station, and a polling place in the city of Jurmala failing to
stamp about 200 ballots properly.
	   Of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats in the Saeima
(pronounced SIGH-mah), the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party
of Prime Minister Guntars Krasts was the only major party
campaigning to turn down the changes.
	   On issues other than citizenship _ including to seek EU and NATO
membership _ there was wide agreement among the parties. There was
also broad support for the free-market reforms that have raised
Latvia up from the stagnant Soviet era.
	   Voter support for one party or another appeared to depend as
much on the personality of leaders as on specific issues.
	   In the early results, the new center-right Peoples Party was at
the top with 26 percent. Party leader Andris Skele has said Latvia
relies too much on transit trade to and from Russia, and said
policies should also focus on producing goods in Latvia for export.
	   The conservative Latvia's Way had 23 percent, followed by the
Union of Social Democrats, Fatherland and Freedom and the New
Party.

Carter calls on Spain to counter US policy in Cuba
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTANDER, Spain (AP) _ Former US President Jimmy Carter on
Saturday called on Spain to ``help correct the mistake that is US
policy towards Cuba'' by investing in the Caribbean island, news
reports said.
	   During a lecture delivered in Spanish in this northern city,
Carter said ``Via investment, visits, inspiration and example we
should find a way to alleviate the suffering of the Cuban people
and help them find a route towards liberty and democracy,'' the
private news agency Europa Press reported.
	   Spanish companies, particularly in the tourist industry, are
among the most enthusiastic explorers of investment opportunities
in the Caribbean island.
	   Carter has criticized U.S. restrictions on economic relations
with Cuba before, on the grounds that they allow Cuban leader Fidel
Castro to portray himself as a martyr.
	   During his talk, given on invitation of a local savings bank and
entitled ``family values and the virtue of saving,'' Carter also
emphasized the cultural links between Spain and its former colonies
in Latin America that should aid economic cooperation, the agency
reported.
	   The former president also said that Spain's remarkably smooth
transition to democracy after dictator Gen. Francisco Franco died
in 1975 had partially inspired him to set up the
democracy-promoting Carter Center in 1982.
	   Carter was next week due to visit several more cities around
Spain during a private vacation with his family, Europa Press said.

	   After appearing in several British films, McDowall at 11 was
among the children evacuated to the United States during the German
bombardment. Hollywood producers were impressed with his innocent
face and precise diction, and he was first cast in Fritz Lang's
``Man Hunt.'' The boy emerged as a star in John Ford's saga of
Welsh coal miners, ``How Green Was My Valley.''
	   ``I can't say I was unhappy as a child actor in films, because I
wasn't,'' he said in a 1963 interview.
	   ``I had a particularly wonderful time. The only trouble was that
by the time I got to be 17 or 18, Hollywood was still thinking of
me in terms of what I had delivered at the age of 11.
	   ``They said I couldn't play anything but an English boy. I knew
I could. So I went to New York and started to study, because I knew
I had to learn a lot about myself as an actor; you can't act the
same as you did as a child.
	   ``Fortunately, I happened to go east at a time when live
television was centered in New York. For six years I played every
kind of role, from Mexican-Americans to Midwestern Americans. I did
different roles on the stage: a Chicago boy in `Compulsion' and a
southerner in `No Time for Sergeants.' ''
	   That ability to move into almost any role led him to be cast as
a Roman emperor in ``Cleopatra,'' a Bible figure in ``The Greatest
Story Ever Told'' and as Cornelius in ``The Planet of the Apes''
and sequels.
	   He was born Roderick Andrew Anthony Jude McDowall on Sept. 17,
1928, in London. His father was Scottish, his mother Irish.
Educated at St. Joseph's school, he made his film debut at 8 in
``Murder in the Family.'' He came to the United States after the
Blitz, the German bombardment of London, began in 1940.
	   He was placed under contract with Twentieth Century Fox, later
moved to MGM. His schooling took place on the Fox lot, though he
graduated at University High School in West Los Angeles in 1947.
	   The young actor proved popular in films with animals, notably
``My Friend Flicka'' and ``Lassie Come Home.'' Among his other
features as a child: ``Son of Fury,'' ``The Pied Piper,'' ``The
White Cliffs of Dover,'' ``The Keys of the Kingdom.'' He also
appeared as Malcolm in Orson Welles' ``MacBeth.''
	   McDowall spent most of the 1950s in New York, making his
Broadway debut in 1953 in ``Misalliance.'' His film career enjoyed
a rebirth in the 1960s, notably in three epics: ``Cleopatra'' (as
Octavian Caesar), ``The Longest Day'' (as a soldier), ``The
Greatest Story Ever Told'' (as Matthew). He also spent a year on
Broadway in the musical ``Camelot.''
	   ``I still have the actor's disease,'' he admitted at the time.
``I always think I'll never get another job.''
	   Despite his fears, McDowall remained one of the busiest actors
in films and television. His most successful film was the 1968
``Planet of the Apes,'' and he appeared in the ape makeup in three
sequels.
	   Among his other films: ``Inside Daisy Clover,'' ``Midas Run,''
``Five Card Stud,'' ``Bedknobs and Broomsticks,'' ``The Life and
Times of Judge Roy Bean,'' ``The Poseidon Adventure,'' ``Funny
Lady,'' ``Only the Lonely.''
	   He also became a favorite in horror films such as ``Cult of the
Damned,'' ``The Legend of Hell House,'' ``Fright Night,'' and
``It!''
	   In the 1980s and `90s, he worked mostly in television dramas.
Among them: ``The Thief of Baghdad,'' ``The Martian Chronicles,''
``Alice in Wonderland,'' ``Hollywood Wives,'' ``Around the World in
80 Days.''
	   McDowall, who never married, was an accomplished photographer
who produced five coffee-table books, starting with ``Double
Exposure'' in 1966. He photographed his lifelong friend and costar
of ``Lassie Come Home,'' Elizabeth Taylor, in a nude layout for
Playboy magazine in 1963. A longtime student of film, he gathered
one of the largest private collections of old movies.
	   No services were planned.

Nilis return inspires PSV to win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Belgian striker Luc Nilis, in his
first league game this season after a long injury absence, Saturday
led PSV Eindhoven to a 2-0 win over Fortuna Sittard.
	   Feyenoord still has a hundred-percent record and leads the Dutch
premiership by two points from FC Twente and Vitesse Arnhem, but
the top seven teams all play this weekend's games Sunday.
	   Fortuna has never won at PSV but was the better side until
Nilis' free kick broke the deadlock three minutes before the break.
	   Ruud van Nistelrooy, one of the few PSV players to muster
consistent form this season, doubled the lead two minutes after the
restart, but the PSV defense kept on offering Fortuna chances.
	   Despite the win, PSV still cannot make it into the top half of
the table, struggling in tenth place with 10 points from seven
games.
	   But the points were some consolation after a disastrous week
which held a 4-1 hammering at AZ Alkmaar and a Champions League
defeat by Portugal's Benfica.
	   The recovery of MVV continued with a 3-0 victory over Cambuur
Leeuwarden. This was the Maastricht side's third straight win after
starting the season with no points from five outings.
	   And in Saturday's third game Willem II Tilburg failed to improve
its eighth position after Roda JC Kerkrade won on the road for the
first time this season. Belgian Peter van Houdt's two strikes
sealed a 2-1 win.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Roddy McDowall, a child actor in Britain who
became a film star in ``How Green Was My Valley'' and ``Lassie Come
Home'' and as an adult proved a versatile performer in theater,
television and films that included ``The Planet of the Apes,'' died
Saturday. He was 70 and had been diagnosed in April of cancer.
	   McDowall died at his home in the Studio City neighborhood of Los
Angeles, said Dennis Osborne, a friend who said he had cared for

	   ``The youngster may prove this studio's boy counterpart to
Shirley Temple,'' Variety magazine said in a 1941 review.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Roddy McDowall, a child actor in Britain who
became a film star in ``How Green Was My Valley'' and ``Lassie Come
Home'' and as an adult proved a versatile performer in theater,
television and films that included ``The Planet of the Apes,'' died
Saturday. He was 70 and had been diagnosed in April of cancer.
	   McDowall died at his home in the Studio City neighborhood of Los
Angeles, said Dennis Osborne, a friend who said he had cared for
the actor in his final months.
	   ``It was very peaceful,'' Osborne said. ``It was just as he
wanted it. It was exactly the way he planned.''
	   After appearing in several British films, McDowall at 11 was
among the children evacuated to the United States during the German
bombardment. Hollywood producers were impressed with his innocent
face and precise diction, and he was first cast in Fritz Lang's
``Man Hunt.'' The boy emerged as a star in John Ford's saga of
Welsh coal miners, ``How Green Was My Valley.''
	   ``The youngster may prove this studio's boy counterpart to
Shirley Temple,'' Variety magazine said in a 1941 review.
	   ``I can't say I was unhappy as a child actor in films, because I
wasn't,'' he said in a 1963 interview. ``I had a particularly
wonderful time. The only trouble was that by the time I got to be
17 or 18, Hollywood was still thinking of me in terms of what I had
delivered at the age of 11.
	   ``They said I couldn't play anything but an English boy. I knew
I could. So I went to New York and started to study, because I knew
I had to learn a lot about myself as an actor; you can't act the
same as you did as a child.
	   ``Fortunately, I happened to go east at a time when live
television was centered in New York. For six years I played every
kind of role, from Mexican-Americans to Midwestern Americans. I did
different roles on the stage: a Chicago boy in `Compulsion' and a
southerner in `No Time for Sergeants.' ''
	   That ability to move into almost any role led him to be cast as
a Roman emperor in ``Cleopatra,'' a Bible figure in ``The Greatest
Story Ever Told'' and as Cornelius in ``The Planet of the Apes''
and sequels.
	   He was born Roderick Andrew Anthony Jude McDowall on Sept. 17,
1928, in London. His father was Scottish, his mother Irish.
Educated at St. Joseph's school, he made his film debut at 8 in
``Murder in the Family.'' He came to the United States after the
Blitz, the German bombardment of London, began in 1940.
	   Among his other films: ``Inside Daisy Clover,'' ``Midas Run,''
``Five Card Stud,'' ``Bedknobs and Broomsticks,'' ``The Life and
Times of Judge Roy Bean,'' ``The Poseidon Adventure,'' ``Funny
Lady,'' ``Only the Lonely.''
	   No services were planned.
	   He was survived by his sister, Virginia McDowall of Los Angeles,
Osborne said.

Bordeaux slips up at Bastia as Marseille closes in at top
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Bordeaux lost its first match of the season at
Bastia on Saturday to allow Marseille, which beat Toulouse, to
close the gap at the top of the French first division to one point.
	   In a night of shocks in the eighth round of the championship,
Lyon lost its unbeaten record at improving Nantes, while
much-fancied Monaco was also defeated, at surprise challengers
Rennes.
	   Bordeaux is still top with 19 points, but Marseille is now only
a single point behind, while Nantes has 16 points, one ahead of
Lyon.
	   Bordeaux had won six and drawn one of its seven matches before
visiting Corsica on Saturday, but was soon in trouble, conceding a
ninth minute Paulo Alves goal.
	   Bastia displayed its typically abrasive style to hamper in-form
Bordeaux, which qualified for the second round of the UEFA Cup
Tuesday with a fine 2-1 win at Rapid Vienna.
	   Sylvain Wiltord and Kiki Musampa came close for the league
leaders but Bastia won the game on the hour when Pierre-Yves Andres
scored with a 20 meter (yard) free kick.
	   Powerhouse Marseille, continued its unbeaten start to the season
with a 2-0 win at home to struggling Toulouse.
	   In front of more than 47,000 spectators at the Stade Velodrome,
Marseille put the visitors under pressure from the start and
finally broke through just before half time when ex-Paris
Saint-Germain striker Florian Maurice collected a pass from
Christophe Dugarry and fired in from 12 meters (yards).
	   Fabrizio Ravanelli came close with a free kick from just outside
the penalty area early in the second half, but the home team
continued to cruise through the match and it was the Italian who
clinched three points with a second goal five minutes from the end.
	   Nantes continues to climb the table and leapt to third place by
beating Lyon.
	   Young strikers Frederic da Rocha and Olivier Monterrubio scored
for the canaries.
	   Modest Rennes continued its good form with a surprise 2-1 win
over big spending Monaco.
	   Nicolas Gousse and Shabani Nonda scored in quick succession
midway through the second half for Rennes.
	   Thierry Henry, dropped Thursday from the French national roster,
pulled one back for Monaco but Rennes held on for a fine win.
	   In other matches Saturday: Auxerre 3, Strasbourg 1; Le Havre 3,
Sochaux 0; Montpellier 5, Lorient 1.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The United States and other economic powers
moved ahead Saturday toward an overhaul of the world's financial
system to prevent widening market turmoil from pushing more
countries into recession.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton telephoned British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and French President Jacques Chirac to lobby personally
for a set of proposals he put forward Friday. Central to the U.S.
idea is to use the International Monetary Fund to provide more
money, faster, to countries threatened with a flight of panicked
investors.
	   Blair and Chirac said they liked the U.S. approach, and other
countries as well have had favorable reactions in discussions with
administration economic officials, presidential spokesman Joe
Lockhart said.
	   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, who helped develop the proposals, sought the
endorsements of finance ministers and central bank presidents from
the world's seven richest countries.
	   After hearing Rubin explain the suggestion that new IMF credit
lines be established for countries threatened with investor flight,
Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters: ``He asked
me to support it, and I said I would.''
	   The Group of Seven meeting, at historic Blair House across
Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House was expected to be pivotal
in trying to develop strategies to halt a 15-month economic crisis,
as are sessions beginning Sunday of the 182-nation IMF and World
Bank. The World Bank generally loans money for development projects
in poor countries, and the IMF oversees rescue efforts for
countries experiencing financial difficulties.
	   A collapse of currencies and stock markets triggered by a flight
of foreign investment money has pushed several Asian nations into
steep recession, leveled the Russian economy and is now threatening
to strike Brazil and other nations in Latin America.
	   While other countries had their own ideas about how to address
the current market turmoil, Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin
said he believes the crisis' urgency is molding ``a growing
consensus about what needs to be done.''
	   Britain's top finance official, Chancellor of the Exchequer
Gordon Brown, also sounded a note of urgency and suggested that the
Bank of England might act as early as next week to cut interest
rates. That would follow the lead of the Federal Reserve, which cut
a key U.S. rate by a quarter-point last Tuesday to help ward off
recession in the United States.
	   ``As we meet here in Washington, we are conscious that more than
a quarter of the world is in recession, that the second largest
economy in the world, Japan, is in recession and that the social
casualties of the Asian crisis are rising in numbers,'' Brown said.
He told reporters ``strong, decisive and united leadership'' is
needed to turn talk into action.
	   Finance ministers from 24 developing countries appealed for
lower interest rates from major industrial nations as a way to take
pressure off their foreign debt burdens and ``help restore
confidence in international finance markets.''
	   Still, it was far from certain that all differences will be
resolved in coming days. U.S. officials already have rejected a
French proposal to turn the IMF's interim committee into a more
permanent crisis-coordination body.
	   ``My guess is we won't find a silver bullet, but we will come
out with a process,'' World Bank President James Wolfensohn said.
	   The U.S. proposal does prescribe new money for the IMF but would
require Congress to approve the administration's request of dlrs 18
billion to replenish IMF resources depleted by the need to assemble
more than dlrs 100 billion in bailouts for Thailand, Indonesia,
South Korea and Russia.
	   That approval is in doubt given significant Republican
opposition in the House. GOP Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said
Clinton's call for quicker release of IMF money is precisely the
wrong approach for an agency that has failed so far to halt the
crisis from widening.
	   Other aspects of change being considered are to increase banking
supervision in poor countries and provide more loans to help
stricken corporations in crisis countries get back on their feet.
	   The United States also was pushing to get the IMF and other
donors behind a rescue for Brazil of perhaps dlrs 30 billion, which
could be announced soon after Sunday's presidential elections
there.
	   Rubin and Greenspan pressed the case for Japan to act more
forcefully in Saturday's discussions with Miyazawa. U.S. officials
have said troubled Asian countries cannot hope to resume growth
unless Japan cleans up its banking troubles and emerges from its
own recession.
	   In a Treasury statement, Rubin welcomed Japan's offer of dlrs 30
billion in new loans to support other Asian nations and said
Miyazawa ``explained his government's intention to take all
possible steps to promote financial stability.''

Barcelona trounces Valencia 3-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VALENCIA, Spain (AP) _ Brazilians Rivaldo and Sonny Anderson,
together with new Dutch signing Patrick Kluivert gave FC Barcelona
a 3-1 victory over Valencia in Saturday's only match in the Spanish
premier league.
	   But the fifth-round match began far from smoothly for the
defending champions when Argentine striker Claudio Lopez put
Valencia one goal up with a 14th minute header from just inside the
box.
	   Sharp keeping from Santiago Canizares prevented FC Barcelona
from equalizing until a scramble for the ball in front of the
Valencia net ended with Kluivert making it 1-1 in the 55th minute.
	   Then it was up to Rivaldo to dribble past Canizares and slide in
Barcelona's second goal in the 72nd.
	   Fellow countryman Anderson added a third goal just a couple of
minutes after being brought onto the field, and just before the
final whistle blew.
	   Barcelona's victory gives the superteam nine points, still one
behind the current table leader and archrival Real Madrid that
hosts Betis on Sunday.
	   The remaining eight matches of the 5th round are also due
Sunday, taking Zaragoza to Extremadura, Mallorca to Tenerife, sees
Atletico Madrid play Oviedo, Real Sociedad host Deportivo La
Coruna, Espanyol welcome Villarreal, Valladolid travel to
Salamanca, Athletic Bilbao visit Celta and Alaves receive Racing.

Unseen Monty Python episodes for German TV found in cellar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ And now for something completely different: In
German.
	   Two previously unaired TV programs made by the Monty Python team
for German TV have been found in a cellar after nearly 30 years,
The Sunday Times reported.
	   The newspaper said that Python member Terry Jones discovered the
two, 45 minute episodes, entitled Fliegender Zirkus, as he was
carrying out a random audit of his cellar. The newspaper did not
report when the films were found or for which German TV station
they were made for, but said that the episodes were being released
on video this week.
	   The Sunday Times said that the sketches were recorded in 1971,
when the Monty Python team were offered work in Munich, southern
Germany, to experiment with Ango-German comedy. The scripts were
written in English and translated into German for the comedians to
read out.
	   The sketches appeared as bizarre - and sometimes as tasteless -
as the ones Monty Python made in English.
	   According to the newspaper, this was the Monty Python's take on
the great German painter, Albrecht Durer. ``Born 1471 in Nuremberg,
died 1528 somewhere else, famous throughout Europe for his
paintings, his engravings, and his car hire business.''
	   There was also a sketch with John Cleese playing a Hitlerian
game show host. He also played the part of a Robin Hood terrorizing
woodland animals, The Sunday Times said.
	   ``There was a sketch about Bavarian waiters, which caused some
problems when the luckless guest was apparently thrown out of the
window to his death. The Germans thought we were going a bit too
far with that one,'' the newspaper quoted Ian MacNaughton, the
show's producer, as saying.
	   The six members of Monty Python: John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael
Palin, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and Graham Chapman, recorded 44
comedy programs in English for the British Broadcasting Corp.
between 1969 and 1974.

Serbs say they will restore Kosovo to normal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS that Yugoslav government has called special meeting of
federal parliament for Monday &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian authorities, in their latest
move to head off NATO missiles and bombs, installed an interim
government in Kosovo on Saturday that they said was aimed at
restoring conditions in the rebellious province to normal.
	   Zoran Andjelkovic, the man appointed by the Serbian Parliament
to head the 18-member Interim Executive Council, told the new
members at their first session in the Kosovo Parliament building:
``We have to defeat the terrorists and work for the benefit of all
our citizens.''
	   Meanwhile, the Yugoslav air defense has been placed on the
highest state of alert to counter possible NATO airstrikes, said a
Yugoslav army commander who spoke Saturday on condition of
anonymity.
	   Constituting the new council, moribund since 1989, was part of a
last-ditch effort to show Serbs intend to end the conflict and came
just two days before a report by United Nations chief Kofi Annan on
whether Belgrade is complying with demands to halt its assault on
ethnic Albanians. If not, Washington has indicated NATO airstrikes

	   Late Friday, the Yugoslav government called a special session of
the federal parliament for Monday to discuss how to ``protect the
international position and state interests'' of the country.

Moore wins close qualifying battle

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ If the final round of qualifying is indicative of
how competitive the inaugural Texaco Grand Prix will be, the
drivers will be nothing less than ace forecasters.
	   Canadian Greg Moore barely beat Scotsman Dario Franchitti on
Saturday in a dramatic battle for the pole position. The Canadian
will start first Sunday on the 2.457-kilometer (1.527-mile),
10-turn temporary street circuit circling the downtown George R.
Brown Convention Center.
	   Moore, assessed an eight-minute penalty for an infraction
Friday, won the pole while idle in the pits at the end of the
30-minute qualifying session. His lap of 59.508 seconds was good
enough for his fourth pole of the season and CART Indy-car FedEx
Series career.
	   Franchitti, who will start from the front row for the seventh
time in his last nine races, wound up second just 22 hundredths of
a seconds behind.
	   ``I got in my fast lap pretty early, but I didn't think it would
be enough,'' Moore said. ``Because I had the penalty (for causing a
red flag in Friday's time trials with a spinout), at the end, I
knew I had only another lap or two.
	   ``I had a real good one going and I swung out my rear end a
little bit and that was it. Dario ran two really good laps at the
end and I thought I was going to lose it.''
	   Franchitti was the only one close to Moore. Former CART champion
Jimmy Vasser of the United States was third with a lap of 59.720,
followed by Canadian Paul Tracy at 59.735.
	   The top 15 drivers on the 28-car grid were separated by less
than a second, with the top 26 within 2 seconds of the pole winner.
	   ``I think it's going to be a war on Sunday,'' Franchitti said
with a grin. ``I think it's going to be a fun day for us and for
the fans.''
	   One reason for the optimism is that the new track, although
short and winding, is wider than the average street circuit,
offering at least some hope of passing.
	   ``I think there's going to be a couple of passing zones,''
Vasser said.
	   Franchitti, sitting alongside, leaned toward Vasser and jokingly
asked, ``What places are those?''
	   ``I'll show you tomorrow,'' Vasser replied.
	   Moore shrugged when asked about passing on the new track,
saying.
	   ``It's difficult to tell, really,'' he said. ``In practice and
qualifying, you're trying to stay away from everybody, to get a
clear track.
	   ``Sunday, in the warmup, is going to be the first chance to see
where you're going to be able to pass somebody. But I think there's
at least one good place.''
	   There should be plenty of motivation for the drivers to take a
risk on Sunday, with six of the starters embroiled in a tight
battle for second place in the series and the dlrs 500,000 payoff
that goes with it.
	   ``It's a risk-versus-reward thing,'' Vasser said, indicating
that a one-stop strategy could be in the offing.
	   The championship has already been wrapped up by Italy's Alex
Zanardi. His teammate, Vasser is in second place, with Mexican
Adrian Fernandez, Franchitti, Moore, and Americans Michael Andretti
and Scott Pruett within 28 points.
	   ``Taking second place would be awfully important to me, but it's
important to Dario and Jimmy and those other guys, too,'' Moore
said. ``I think you're going to see an exciting race tomorrow.''
	   Zanardi, who crashed into a tire wall in qualifying on Friday,
did it again Saturday, hitting in almost the same spot midway
through the session. His fast lap stood up for eighth place.
	   ``I had the same problem as I did yesterday with the gearbox,''
the frustrated Italian said. ``When I downshift, it locks up on me.
I'm unhappy because there was more left in the car. It was a bad
deal.''
	   Another frustrated driver was three-time champion Bobby Rahal,
who started the day on the provisional pole and fell all the way to
ninth.
	   ``We have a better car than we showed,'' Rahal said. ``I had a
couple of good laps going and traffic really hurt us. The race will
not go to the fastest driver Sunday. It will go to the smartest
driver.
	   ``This track is a lot like Toronto, with the long straights. It
will be hard on the tires and brakes. Even in qualifying you saw a
lot of guys slide into the runoff areas. I expect more of that in
the race.''

Turkish military launches new incursion into northern Iraq

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ About 10,000 Turkish soldiers have crossed
into northern Iraq to attack Kurdish rebels, and the government
said it might send forces into Syria to eradicate guerrilla bases
there, news reports said Saturday.
	   Turkey's incursion into northern Iraq on Friday followed two
days of airstrikes against suspected rebel bases, the daily
Hurriyet said.
	   Turkish Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in southeastern
Turkey wage cross-border raids from camps in Iraq, Iran and Syria.
The Ankara government accuses Syria of aiding the rebels, a charge
Damascus denies.
	   In an effort to ease escalating tension between Syria and
Turkey, Egypt said Saturday that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
will travel to Damascus and Ankara for talks.
	   Necati Utkan, the Turkish foreign ministry spokesman, told the
Anatolia news agency that Mubarak was expected to arrive in Ankara
on Monday. He did not elaborate.
	   The military did not return calls for comment.
	   The rebels, fighting for an autonomy in southeastern Turkey,
stage hit-and-run attacks from bases in Syria, Iraq and Iran.
	   On Friday Turkey strongly warned Syria that its ``patience was
running out,'' and Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was quoted Saturday
by the daily Hurriyet as saying, ``the soldier is awaiting an
order.''
	   But an intelligence official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Saturday that the troop deployments were not
targeting Syria, but infiltrations of Kurdish rebels.
	   Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, chief of the general staff, has
described the mounting tension with Syria as ``an undeclared war''
amid unconfirmed reports of troop deployments along the
Turkish-Syrian border by both sides.
	   According to daily Cumhuriyet on Saturday, the military has
reinforced its units near the border town of Reyhanli, with an
artillery, an engineer and an infantry battalions.
	   On Saturday, Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said Turkey would
soon carry out an exercise near the Syrian border, private NTV
television reported.
	   Turkey has never conducted wargames along the Syrian border. The
exercise was expected to follow current NATO maneuvers, running in
an area close to Syria through Oct. 21.
	   In a show of force, Turkish jets buzzed along the Syrian border
on Friday, daily Radikal reported Saturday.
	   Hurriyet newspaper said the Turkish units also sealed the escape
routes of the rebels along the Syrian-Iraqi border inside northern
Iraq.
	   Sezgin said Turkey was still trying to use diplomatic means to
solve the problem. ``But there is a limit of patience,'' NTV quoted
him as saying. ``Then we will do whatever necessary.''
	   Damascus denied the allegations and accused Turkey of plotting
with Israel to create a crisis with the aim of undermining Syria.
	   In Jerusalem, Defense Ministry spokesman Avi Benayahu said
Israel is not involved ``in any way'' in the Turkey-Syria
confrontation.

Early results: Latvians approve eased citizenship for Russians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with results after 45 percent of precincts reporting. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Latvians appeared to have narrowly approved
their parliament's controversial measures to ease citizenship
requirements for the country's hundreds of thousands of stateless
Russians in a referendum Saturday, according to early results.
	   A referendum held in conjunction with voting for the country's
100-seat parliament asked voters if they want to reject
liberalizing citizenship law amendments that legislators passed in
June.
	   With votes counted from about 45 percent of the country's
precincts, the changes were being approved by a 52-46 margin. The
remainder apparently were blank or spoiled ballots.
	   If the acceptance is borne out in the final results, the former
Soviet republic will have headed off an unpleasant confrontation
with the West. But whether the results would mollify Russia, which
has rained denunciations on Latvia for its treatment of ethnic
Russians, is in doubt.
	   Although the changes remove years of waiting for citizenship
applicants, the laws still require adults to have competence in
Latvian, which many who grew up in all-Russian communities within
Latvia regard as unreasonable.
	   Russians make up 45 percent of the country's 2.5 million
population.
	   The amendments were passed after a tense spring in which Russia
threatened trade sanctions against its diminutive neighbor. Moscow
mayor Yuri Luzhkov's accused Latvia of committing genocide.
	   The West too was unhappy with Latvia, though its statements were
more measured. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe urged changes and many officials predicted that the European
Union, which Latvia ardently wants to join, would never let the
country in unless it lowered the obstacles to citizenship.
	   But after the amendments were passed, a referendum drive to
overturn them began, spearheaded by nationalist politicians who
claim Latvian national identity is imperiled.
	   After Latvia became independent of the Soviet Union in 1991,
citizenship was granted to ethnic Latvians and to anyone who had
lived there prior to the Soviet annexation in 1940.
	   That left out the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians who
poured into Latvia during Soviet rule, and to their children _ even
those born in Latvia. Today, about 452,000 of the country's 740,000
ethnic Russians are without citizenship.
	   Because they can't vote, they regarded Saturday's referendum
with angry resignation.
	   ``I was born in Riga, I live in Riga, but I am Russian and can't
vote. I don't like it here,'' said a young woman who gave her name
only as Alex, selling cassettes in the vast market sprawling on the
outskirts of downtown.
	   But many people who could vote were annoyed because the
referendum question was phrased confusingly: a ``yes'' vote meaning
``no'' to the changes.
	   ``Frankly, I didn't understand the issue or the ballot,'' said
79-year-old Dzetins Alois, who voted in the parliamentary election
but not in the referendum.
	   Some voting irregularities were reported, including President
Guntis Ulmanis giving a television interview inside a polling
station, and a polling place in the city of Jurmala failing to
stamp about 200 ballots properly.
	   Of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats in the Saeima
(pronounced SIGH-mah), the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party
of Prime Minister Guntars Krasts was the only major party
campaigning to turn down the changes.
	   On issues other than citizenship _ including to seek EU and NATO
membership _ there was wide agreement among the parties. There was
also broad support for the free-market reforms that have raised
Latvia up from the stagnant Soviet era.
	   Voter support for one party or another appeared to depend as
much on the personality of leaders as on specific issues.
	   In the early results, the new center-right Peoples Party was at
the top with 22.8 percent. Party leader Andris Skele has said
Latvia relies too much on transit trade to and from Russia, and
said policies should also focus on producing goods in Latvia for
export.
	   The conservative Latvia's Way had was just a fraction behind,
followed by the Union of Social Democrats, Fatherland and Freedom
and the New Party.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian authorities, in their latest
move to head off NATO missiles and bombs, installed an interim
government in Kosovo on Saturday that they said was aimed at
restoring conditions in the rebellious province to normal.
	   Zoran Andjelkovic, the man appointed by the Serbian Parliament
to head the 18-member Interim Executive Council, told the new
members at their first session in the Kosovo Parliament building,
``We have to defeat the terrorists and work for the benefit of all
our citizens.''
	   Meanwhile, the Yugoslav air defense has been placed on the
highest state of alert to counter possible NATO airstrikes, said a
Yugoslav army commander who spoke Saturday on condition of
anonymity.
	   Constituting the council, moribund since 1989, was part of a
last-ditch effort to show that Serbs intend to end the conflict. It
came just two days before a report by U.N. chief Kofi Annan on
whether Belgrade is complying with demands to halt its assault on
ethnic Albanians in the restive province. If not, Washington has
indicated that NATO airstrikes will follow within two weeks.
	   Late Friday, the Yugoslav government called a special session of
the federal parliament for Monday to discuss how to ``protect the
international position and state interests'' of the country.

Mexican Indian rebels promise peaceful elections in Chiapas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TRINA KLEIST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Indian rebels will not
interfere with local elections in southern state of Chiapas, their
leader said in a communique released here Saturday.
	   More than 1.9 million people are registered to vote Sunday for
new authorities in 111 counties and 40 state legislature seats from
24 districts.
	   ``In view of the fledgling efforts of the civil society to
re-establish a climate of dialogue, the Zapatista Army will not
undertake any type of action which would delay or interfere with
the elections,'' wrote Subcomandante Marcos, leader of the
Zapatista National Liberation Army.
	   Despite Marcos' communique, indications from throughout the area
of rebel influence were that Zapatista supporters would probably
boycott Sunday's elections.
	   Zapatista supporters, mostly Indian peasants, have set up more
than 30 parallel local governments in defiance of state control,
some of them issuing birth, marriage and death certificates and
directing public works.
	   ``Why should we vote? We already have our authorities,'' said
Domingo Perez Paciencia, president of a rebel government in the
highlands county of Chenalho.
	   The Zapatistas staged a brief rebellion in 1994 demanding land
reform, justice and greater democracy. Peace talks have deadlocked
since 1996, when the government reneged on preliminary agreements
on Indian autonomy, saying the agreements were too vague.
	   Civic Alliance, a national election watchdog group, criticized
both the Zapatista boycott and harassment of rebel supporters by
government troops. Military convoys of at least 315 armored
vehicles carrying about 1,500 troops last week entered the rebel
area in the eastern jungle.
	   ``This electoral process should be an opportunity for Chiapans
to wield a powerful tool for peace,'' Civic Alliance leader Sandra
Garcia said, but added that conditions as they are now ``put that
possibility in doubt.''
	   Despite the problems, Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen said
conditions existed for clean and fair elections. ``The immense
majority of Chiapans want ballots, not bullets,'' Albores told
reporters late Friday.

some 10,000 people against a regional leader elected with the help
of votes from the far right.
	   Hours later, petty violence prevailed, interrupting a concert in
downtown Lyon by Cheb Mami, an Algerian songster of the
contemporary music known as rai. He was reported slightly injured
by a can thrown onto the stage.
	   No serious injuries were reported during the incidents that had
no apparent link with the earlier demonstration.
	   France Info radio reported that police were making arrests, but
gave no numbers.
	   Hours earlier, an estimated 10,000 people turned out at the
downtown square to protest the election more than six months ago of
Charles Million to the presidency of the Rhone Alpes regional
council with votes from the far right.

	   PINE MOUNTAIN, Georgia (AP) _ Fred Funk, seeking a wire-to-wire
victory on one of his favorite courses, shot a 4-under-par 68 on
Saturday for a one-stroke lead over Bill Glasson in the Buick
Challenge.
	   Funk took an 18-under 198 total into Sunday's final round.
	   Glasson fired his second consecutive 65 to stay close to Funk,
the 1995 winner and 1996 runner-up.
	   Funk topped the leaderboard for the third straight day. He
opened with a 63 on Thursday and shot a 67 on Friday on the
7,057-yard (6,450-meter) Mountain View course at the Callaway
Gardens resort 75 miles (120 kilometers) southwest of Atlanta.
	   J.L. Lewis was three strokes back after a 66.
	   Steve Elkington, also with a 66, and rookie of the year
contender Steve Flesch followed at 202. Flesch, who was second,
three strokes behind Funk entering Saturday's play, had a 69.
	   Neil Lancaster and Jim Carter, who was the opening round
co-leader with Funk, were at 203. Lancaster had a 66 and Carter a
69.
	   Leading money-winner David Duval was six shots behind Funk at
204 after a 70, tied with D.A. Weibring, who had a 71.
	   Funk, 30th on the money list with dlrs 825,000, led by three
strokes entering the day and had a four-stroke lead after 12 holes
over Glasson, who closed the gap with birdies on Nos. 14-16.
	   Funk held the lead despite a bogey on No. 16 and pars on his
last two holes.
	   Glasson, beset by medical problems the last few years, is making
only his 10th start of the year. He has made the cut in seven
events and earned dlrs 238,131 _ 111th on the money list _ with a
tie for fifth at the Bell South Classic his best effort.
	   Glasson, who has seven career wins and earnings of over dlrs 4.4
million, had an eagle on the par-5, 508-yard (464-meter) second
hole and added five birdies in his round seeking the dlrs 270,000
first prize.
	   Funk, who has five tour victories, including the Deposit
Guaranty Classic this year, considered withdrawing prior to
Thursday's opening round when his back stiffened up, but after
being worked on by a physical therapist, it has not bothered him
since.
	   The field has 19 of the top 30 money-winners, including Vijay
Singh, the PGA champion and defending champion Davis Love. Both
shot 70s and were at 209. Hal Sutton, who won the Texas Open last
week, opened with a par 72 before a 66 Friday and a 67 Saturday for
a 205 total.

Three Egyptians interrogated after arrests in Turin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Investigators were trying to learn if three
Egyptians arrested in this northern city might have been planning a
terrorist attack here or abroad, state radio reported early Sunday.
	   The three men, arrested on Friday, were interrogated late
Saturday by Turin investigative magistrate Marcello Tatangelo, the
ANSA news agency reported.
	   Seized by police in a warehouse rented by the three were three
pistols equipped with silenzers, an Uzi machine gun, ammunition,
wigs, radio transmitters and gold ingots, ANSA said.
	   Only one of the three was immediately identified. ANSA reported
he was Elleban Mamdouh, who has lived in Italy for 16 years and
worked as a vendor of fruit and vegetables.
	   The three men were being held on charges of possession war
weapons, ANSA said.
	   ANSA said it did not appear there was any immediate link between
the three men and the two bombing attacks in Africa this summer of
U.S. embassies.

McGee leads Vantage Championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CLEMMONS, North Carolina (AP) _ Jerry McGee shot a 7-under-par
63 on Saturday to take a three-stroke lead over defending champion
Hale Irwin and Joe Inman after the second round of the Vantage
Championship.
	   McGee, 55, matched the Tanglewood Park course record set by Dave
Stockton in 1994. He birdied five of the first 10 holes and closed
with an eagle on the par-5 18th _ the only time he used a driver in
the bogey-free round.
	   ``It was a gratifying round,'' said McGee, who attributes his
year-long struggles to an erratic driver. ``I made up my mind this
week to play my own game. You can see the results.''
	   Irwin, who leads the Senior PGA Tour with six victories and
record earnings of dlrs 2,367,420, shot a 65 to join Inman at
8-under 132. Inman had a 66. Gil Morgan, a five-time winner who is
second on the money list with dlrs 1,678,447, shot a 67 to join
Allen Doyle (65) and Ray Floyd (69) at 133.
	   The 63 was the low round of the year for the McGee, whose best
finishes are a pair of ties for 12th. He is 56th on the money list
with dlrs 237,436.
	   With the winner's share worth dlrs 225,000, McGee would almost
double that by earning his first win since joining the tour in
1993.
	   ``You have to play within yourself,'' he said. ``I'm going to do
that (Sunday). I don't care if I shoot 90.''
	   Not that Irwin figures to need that much help. The tour's best
player _ McGee praised him by calling him ``Mr. Senior Tour'' _
also got around without a bogey.
	   ``You know he's going to shoot 65 or something,'' McGee said of
Irwin. ``You just have to go out and play a good round. I have no
control over Hale Irwin. I wish the heck I did.''
	   Irwin, who also won the Vantage in 1995, is coming off his only
finish outside the top-5 all year, a tie for 13th in the Boone
Valley Classic.
	   ``I'm having to work at it a little harder,'' Irwin said. ``The
string of successes has finally caught up with me. The
concentration has sort of wobbled a bit.
	   ``I'm not complaining about the results. It's the manner in
which I'm getting there. It has not been the vintage level of play
that I've been accustomed to.''
	   Inman, a former standout at nearby Wake Forest University, also
is seeking his first victory as a senior. He has two top-10
finishes to his credit, the best a tie for third in the BankBoston
Classic.
	   ``I'm just out there to play my game,'' Inman said. ``I never
dreamed I'd be out here doing this.''
	   The tournament lost one of its top draws when Chi Chi Rodriguez
withdrew for personal reasons prior to the start of his second
round. Rodriguez, 62, has played poorly in 1998, recording just two
top-25 finishes in 21 events. He shot a 75 on Friday.

 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: New York mayor tours two islands hit by
hurricane &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ New York City mayor Rudolph
Giuliani touched down in the hurricane-wracked Dominican Republic
on Saturday, promising to send more aid and ``make a special
project'' of repairing a damaged hospital.
	   He continued on to Puerto Rico where he visited a shelter and
joined Gov. Pedro Rossello for an aerial survey of some of the
damage done by the worst hurricane to hit the island in 70 years.
	   At least 249 people died and more than 100,000 lost their homes
when Hurricane Georges hit the Dominican Republic on Sept. 22. Only
three died in Puerto Rico, but every part of the island suffered
damage from the hurricane's 110-mph winds.
	   ``The devastation and the damage is even greater than has been
able to be reported,'' said Giuliani during his visit to the
Dominican Republic.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Government sues over alleged dumping of drugs that killed
fish
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The Jamaican government filed suit
against the operators of a Dutch-registered vessel that authorities
believe caused a massive fish kill in Kingston harbor by dumping
drugs overboard.
	   The lawsuit, filed Friday, alleged that the captain and crew
dumped amphetamines into the water when the vessel began sinking.
Samples from dead fish showed traces of the drug, the suit states.
	   When the incident occurred in April, the crew told local
authorities that only sugar was dumped overboard.
	   After an investigation was launched, the captain and crew fled
the island, the lawsuit states.
	   Dumping the toxic materials allegedly violated several Jamaican
laws designed to protect wildlife.
 &UR; GUYANA: Suddenly wealthy may be suddenly under investigation
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Sudden, unexplained wealth would be
cause for a government investigation if anti-money laundering
legislation now being prepared is approved in this South American
country.
	   Concerned about a spate of drug-related crimes and evidence of
money laundering, authorities are planning a special Cabinet
retreat, presided over by President Janet Jagan, to discuss crime
and security.
	   Government lawyers are also drafting legislation that would lead
to systematic investigations of people who show signs of sudden
wealth, National Security Advisor Roger Luncheon said Saturday.
	   ``Unfortunately, it is only now that dedicated efforts are being
made to the economic aspect of narco-trafficking,'' said Luncheon.

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Latvians appeared to have narrowly approved
their parliament's controversial measures to ease citizenship
requirements for the country's hundreds of thousands of stateless
Russians in a referendum Saturday.
	   A referendum held in conjunction with voting for the country's
100-seat parliament asked voters if they want to reject
liberalizing citizenship law amendments that legislators passed in
June.
	   With votes counted from about 78 percent of the country's
precincts, the changes were being approved by a 52-46 margin. The
remainder apparently were blank or spoiled ballots.
	   If the acceptance is borne out in the final results, the former
Soviet republic will have headed off an unpleasant confrontation
with the West. But whether the results would mollify Russia, which
has rained denunciations on Latvia for its treatment of ethnic
Russians, is in doubt.
	   Although the changes remove years of waiting for citizenship
applicants, the laws still require adults to have competence in
Latvian, which many who grew up in all-Russian communities within
Latvia regard as unreasonable.
	   ``This is a turning point for Latvia. It will help us solve our
problems with Russia because our friends in the West will stand
behind us,'' Andris Skele, leader of the People's Party that was
leading the parliamentary polling, said early Sunday.
	   The amendments were passed after a tense spring in which Russia
threatened trade sanctions against its diminutive neighbor. Moscow
mayor Yuri Luzhkov's accused Latvia of committing genocide.
	   The West too was unhappy with Latvia, though its statements were
more measured. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe urged changes and many officials predicted that the European
Union, which Latvia ardently wants to join, would never let the
country in unless it lowered the obstacles to citizenship.
	   But after the amendments were passed, a referendum drive to
overturn them began, spearheaded by nationalist politicians who
claim Latvian national identity is imperiled.
	   After Latvia became independent of the Soviet Union in 1991,
citizenship was granted to ethnic Latvians and to anyone who had
lived there prior to the Soviet annexation in 1940.
	   That left out the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians who
poured into Latvia during Soviet rule, and to their children _ even
those born in Latvia. Today, about 452,000 of the country's 740,000
ethnic Russians are without citizenship.
	   Because they can't vote, they regarded Saturday's referendum
with angry resignation.
	   ``I was born in Riga, I live in Riga, but I am Russian and can't
vote. I don't like it here,'' said a young woman who gave her name
only as Alex, selling cassettes in the vast market sprawling on the
outskirts of downtown.
	   But many people who could vote were annoyed because the
referendum question was phrased confusingly: a ``yes'' vote meaning
``no'' to the changes.
	   ``Frankly, I didn't understand the issue or the ballot,'' said
79-year-old Dzetins Alois, who voted in the parliamentary election
but not in the referendum.
	   Some voting irregularities were reported, including President
Guntis Ulmanis giving a television interview inside a polling
station, and a polling place in the city of Jurmala failing to
stamp about 200 ballots properly.
	   Of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats in the Saeima
(pronounced SIGH-mah), the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party
of Prime Minister Guntars Krasts was the only major party
campaigning to turn down the changes.
	   On issues other than citizenship _ including to seek EU and NATO
membership _ there was wide agreement among the parties. There was
also broad support for the free-market reforms that have raised
Latvia up from the stagnant Soviet era.
	   Voter support for one party or another appeared to depend as
much on the personality of leaders as on specific issues.
	   The center-right People's Party was at the top with about 20
percent, followed by the conservatiive Latvias Way at 18 percent.
	   Also getting more than the 5 percent necessary for Saeima seats
were the Union of Social Democrats, Fatherland and Freedom,
National Harmony and the New Party.

Blair to question China on human rights, newspaper says

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair has said that he will
question China's Communist regime over its human rights record
during his visit to the country, Sunday Business newspaper
reported.
	   ``There is no point in denying we have our differences with
China. Over political and civil rights. Over Tibet. Over freedom of
speech. The treatment of dissent. Religious freedom. The importance
of democracy,'' Sunday Business quoted Blair as saying in an
article in the newspaper attributed to the prime minister.
	   Blair departs Monday on his five-day visit to China and the
former British colony of Hong Kong, which reverted to Chinese rule
on July 1, 1997.
	   ``Britain and China have very different backgrounds and
traditions. I admire China's rich history and many achievements,''
the newspaper quoted Blair as saying in the article. ``But I also
believe that human rights are universal. This is bound to be
discussed, of course, when I meet China's leaders.''
	   Blair will also talk about the Asian financial crisis, Hong Kong
and international terrorism when he meets Premier Zhu Rongji, his
office has said.
	   The British leader was quoted as saying by the newspaper that
the main purpose of his visit is to ``forge a new partnership for
the future'' between Britain and China.
	   ``I do not intend to lecture or play to the gallery. I want
progress, not grandstanding,'' the newspaper quoted Blair as
saying. ``I have said before and I still believe that persuasion
and dialogue achieve more than confrontation and empty rhetoric.
The peace process in Northern Ireland shows that talking can
reconcile the seemingly irreconcilable.''
	   On Tuesday Blair will meet Chinese leaders for an official
greeting in Tiananmen Square, scene of the 1989 government
crackdown on student protesters.
	   Human rights campaigners and critics in the West have accused
China of repressing dissent in Tibet, imprisoning dissidents, using
forced prison labor and lacking religious freedom and a free press.
	   John Major, the last British prime minister, visited China in
1990.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani touched down in Puerto Rico Saturday and made an aerial
survey of some of the damage done by the worst hurricane to hit the
island in 70 years.
	   Joined by Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rosello, he also visited a
shelter and spoke to people who lost their homes to Hurricane
George, which caused at least $2 billion damage to this U.S.
territory.
	   At a news conference in San Juan's colonial district, Giuliani
devoted most of his comments to the Dominican Republic, where he
spent several hours before arriving in Puerto Rico.
	   He promised to send more aid to that country and ``make a
special project'' of repairing a damaged hospital.
	   At least 249 people died and more than 100,000 lost their homes
when Hurricane Georges hit the Dominican Republic on Sept. 22. Only
three died in Puerto Rico, but every part of the island suffered
damage from the hurricane's 110-mph winds.
	   ``The devastation and the damage is even greater than has been
able to be reported,'' said Giuliani during his visit to the
Dominican Republic.
	   He visited a rural hospital that lost electricity and part of
its roof in San Pedro de Macoris, the hometown of Chicago Cubs
slugger Sammy Sosa, about 40 miles (60 kilometers) from the
capital. New York City rescue workers are helping to repair the
hospital.
	   ``As mayor of the second largest Dominican city in the world, we
owe this assistance to the Dominican people,'' said Giuliani, who
was accompanied by New York City Police Commissioner Howard Safir.
About half a million Dominicans live in New York City.
	   Giuliani found conditions markedly better in Puerto Rico.
	   ``The relief effort here is very different,'' he said. ``Some
elements of the relief effort here in Puerto Rico we could learn
from in the United States.''
	   New York City has already provided a million pounds of food,
clothing and water to the Dominican Republic, plus a 63-person
search-and-rescue team which has helped locate bodies, given
emergency medical treatment and repaired damaged infrastructure,
the mayor said.
	   Another half million pounds of supplies could be sent
immediately, providing U.S. airlines donate room in cargo bins,
Giuliani said.
	   In Puerto Rico, the mayor applauded Gov. Rosello's calls to make
buildings more hurricane-resistant during reconstruction.
	   ``The human misery and difficulties and dislocations are
enormous, but the spirit here is so good and so strong that I
actually think that the governor is correct and they're going to
make something good come out of this.''

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The United States and other economic powers
moved ahead Saturday toward an overhaul of the world's financial
system to prevent growing market turmoil from pushing more
countries into recession. President Bill Clinton telephoned British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and French President Jacques Chirac to
lobby personally for a set of proposals he put forward Friday.
Central to the U.S. idea is to use the International Monetary Fund
to provide more money, faster, to countries threatened with a
flight of panicked investors. The Group of Seven meeting was
expected to be pivotal in trying to develop strategies to halt a
15-month economic crisis, as are sessions beginning Sunday of the
182-nation IMF and World Bank. (US-FINANCIAL CRISIS)
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ About 10,000 Turkish soldiers have crossed
into northern Iraq to attack Kurdish rebels, and the government
said it might send forces into Syria to eradicate guerrilla bases
there, news reports said Saturday. Turkey's incursion into northern
Iraq on Friday followed two days of air strikes against suspected
rebel bases, the daily Hurriyet said. Turkish Kurdish rebels
fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey wage cross-border
raids from camps in Iraq, Iran and Syria. The Ankara government
accuses Syria of aiding the rebels, a charge Damascus denies. In an
effort to head off a military conflict, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak was to travel to Turkey and Syria for emergency talks,
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Saturday in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia. (TURKEY-IRAQ-SYRIA-KURDS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian authorities, in their latest
move to head off NATO missiles and bombs, installed an interim
government in Kosovo on Saturday that they said was aimed at
restoring conditions in the rebellious province to normal. Zoran
Andjelkovic, the man appointed by the Serbian Parliament to head
the 18-member Interim Executive Council, told the new members at
their first session in the Kosovo Parliament building, ``We have to
defeat the terrorists and work for the benefit of all our
citizens.'' Meanwhile, the Yugoslav air defense was placed on the
highest state of alert to counter possible NATO airstrikes, said a
Yugoslav army commander who spoke on condition of anonymity. U.N.
chief Kofi Annan plans to issue a report Monday on whether Belgrade
is complying with demands to halt its assault on ethnic Albanians
in the restive province. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Latvians appeared to have narrowly approved
their parliament's controversial measures to ease citizenship
requirements for the country's hundreds of thousands of stateless
Russians in a referendum Saturday, according to early results. A

Russia, which has rained denunciations on Latvia for its treatment

adults to have competence in Latvian, which many who grew up in
all-Russian communities within Latvia regard as unreasonable.

	   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) _ Mongolia's president appealed for
calm Saturday following the killing of a prominent democracy
leader, a death that could further complicate a lengthy political
crisis. President N. Bagabandi's appeal came after Sanjaasuregiin
Zorig, a minister in the ruling Democratic Coalition and a possible
candidate for prime minister, was axed and stabbed to death at his
home late Friday. The killing may further shake public confidence
in the fledgling democracy, which has been embroiled for four
months in a political stalemate that has paralyzed work on crucial
economic reforms. Bagabandi said he was confident that the
attackers, who remained at large, would be brought to justice. The
reason for Zorig's killing remained unclear. Some analysts
speculated that the killing could have been linked to organized
crime or to a private business deal. (MONGOLIA-ASSASSINATION)

	   BOSTON (AP) _ With swirls of marijuana smoke wafting through the
air, about 40,000 people gathered in Boston on Saturday for a rally
supporting legalization of the drug.
	   Police, who had vowed a crackdown on the 9th Annual Freedom
Rally, arrested about 40 on drug possession charges. That's far
fewer than the 150 arrests at last year's event, which attracted
about 10,000 more people.
	   ``The cops were trying to intimidate people from coming ... but
I don't think it worked,'' said Bill Downing, president of the
Massachusetts Cannabis Reform Coalition.
	   At one police checkpoint, Amy Cook and three other students
prayed for pot smokers to turn away from drugs. ``They're going to
do what they're going to do. But they might see us and think twice
later,'' she said.
	   Doug Goudreau, 19, of Peabody, said marijuana was plentiful at
the rally _ at about dlrs 5 per cigarette, or dlrs 20 to dlrs 30
for a small bag.
	   The police, he said, missed a lot of the dealing.
	   ``They don't know what's going on,'' Goudreau said. ``They look
for the fools who are acting stupid.''
	   Tie-dyed shirts, mushroom-shaped hats and marijuana-leaf motifs
were everywhere, as was the unmistakable odor of pot _ masked
occasionally by the smell of tobacco or clove cigarettes.
	   Richard Elrick, a councilman in the Cape Cod town of Barnstable,
sold ``Decriminalize Marijuana'' buttons to help raise money for
the cause.
	   ``Marijuana is less of a public health threat than alcohol or
tobacco,'' he said. ``I can't think of a more counterproductive way
for society to spend its resources than to arrest marijuana
users.''
	   On the west side of the park, 16-year-old Jake Sealine of
Cambridge displayed homemade didgeridoos _ a musical wind
instrument. Many mistook them for marijuana bongs and Sealine had
to explain himself again and again.

shooting spree &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PADUCAH, Kentucky (AP) _ Michael Adam Carneal is said to have
occasionally mocked the morning prayer group that met in the Heath
High School lobby just before the start of each day's classes.
	   Members of the prayer circle didn't think much about it.
	   Other students sometimes picked on and teased the slightly
built, bespectacled ninth-grader, who looked younger than most
freshmen.
	   But Carneal would later tell psychiatrists that he grew tired of
the taunts and felt pressured by the accomplishments of an older
sister, who was valedictorian of the school's 1998 graduating
class. The boy reportedly told friends last fall that ``something
big's going to happen.''
	   On Monday, jury selection is to start for Carneal's trial on
charges of killing three of his classmates and wounding five others
on Dec. 1 at the school in West Paducah. The rampage occurred in
the lobby as the prayer meeting was breaking up, and all of the
victims were members of the group.
	   Witnesses said Carneal reached into a backpack, drew out the
pistol and fired rapidly for about five seconds into the crowd of
about 35 students.
	   Carneal, now 15, was charged as an adult with three counts of
murder, five counts of attempted murder and one count of burglary.
He allegedly stole the .22-caliber pistol used in the shootings and
four other guns.
	   Police said Carneal had also taken two rifles, two shotguns and
three spare clips of ammunition to school that day. The rifles and
shotguns were wrapped in blankets, and curious classmates reported
being told they were props for a science project.
	   It was the second in what became a series of school shootings
over several months. Two students were killed in Pearl,
Mississippi, and four students and a teacher died in a shooting in
Jonesboro, Arkansas. A teacher was shot dead at a school dance in
Edinboro, Pennsylvania, and two students were shot to death at a
school in Springfield, Oregon.
	   If convicted, Carneal could be sentenced to life in prison
without parole for 25 years on each of the murder charges, though
under Kentucky law, multiple sentences must be served concurrently.
In Kentucky, a defendant must be at least 16 when a crime is
committed to be eligible for the death penalty.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani offered to send more disaster aid to the hurricane-ravaged
Dominican Republic during a visit Saturday.
	   Giuliani announced he would send experts to evaluate how New
York can increase aid, possibly by providing health workers and
heavy equipment.
	   Giuliani planned to visit a rural hospital in San Pedro de
Macoris, 40 miles (65 kilometers) from the capital, which is being
repaired by New York rescue workers. He was accompanied by New York
Police Commissioner Howard Safir.
	   At least 249 people died in the Dominican Republic and more than
100,000 lost their homes when Hurricane Georges hit on Sept. 22.
	   An estimated half-million Dominicans live in New York. The city
has already provided 1 million pounds of food, clothing and water,
plus a 63-person search-and-rescue team, the mayor said.
	   Later Saturday, Giuliani landed in storm-damaged Puerto Rico,
where he found conditions markedly better.
	   ``Some elements of the relief effort here in Puerto Rico we
could learn from in the United States,'' he said.
	    &UR; ___
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Doctors on Saturday successfully
carried out an abortion on a 10-year-old rape victim, health
officials said.
	   The girl, who had been four months pregnant, was ``very well''
after the one-hour operation, said state health spokesman Maria
Cristina Gorgueira by telephone.
	   The girl was raped repeatedly over three years by two of her
neighbors in Israelandia, a rural town in central Goias state,
about 560 miles (900 kilometers) northwest of Sao Paulo. Both men
have been arrested and face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.
	   For two weeks the case has been at the center of a debate over
whether she should have an abortion. Several Catholic Church
officials urged her parents not to allow it.
	   In Brazil, abortion is legal only in cases of rape or when a
mother's life would be endangered by childbirth. A court of appeals
on Monday upheld the girl's right to have the abortion.

Pierre Alechinsky Retrospective at Jeu de Paume
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY301 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Pierre Alechinsky has splashed paint on obsolete
maps, old stock certificates and meaningless legal documents. He
has dabbed color over rubbings he made of New York city manhole
covers and framed them with drawings recalling comic strips.
	   Now, a major retrospective of more than 100 of Alechinsky's bold
abstracts has grabbed the limelight at the Jeu de Paume - the most
prestigious showcase for contemporary art in Paris.
	   The exhibition - Alechinsky's third here in two months - is
viewed as belated recognition for the man widely regarded as
Belgium's most famous living artist.
	   ``How fortunate he's finally getting his due,'' French art
critic Jean-Marie Tasset wrote in the daily Le Figaro. ``This is a
man who caused an uproar and woke up the art world.''
	   The show, which opened Sept. 15 and runs through Nov. 22, also
coincides with the 50th anniversary of COBRA, which stands for
(COpenhagen, BRussels, Amsterdam), a short-lived intellectual
movement that Alechinsky co-founded in 1948.
	   It was a utopic take on creation that drew Denmark's Asger Jorn,
Holland's Karel Appel and other northern European artists who
wanted to blur the boundaries between literature and the visual
arts.
	   COBRA fizzled in 1951, but Alechinsky perpetuated its legacy
with a lifelong obsession with the written word, Chinese
calligraphy and graphics.
	   The son of a physician who had emigrated from Russia, he grew up
in Brussels.
	   Naturally left-handed, he was forced to write with his right
hand, but permitted to draw with his left hand - which he does to
this day.
	   Alechinsky, 71, works standing or hunched over, applying the
bright hues of color and layers of India ink that are his trademark
to oversized, imported canvas tacked to the floor.
	   The quick-drying acrylic, he once said, triggered a major
breakthough in his work because it allowed him to ``paint the way I
draw.''
	   Alechinsky's work has a whimsical quality reminiscent of the
``art brut,'' or raw art, that also came of age in postwar France
under the influence of Jean Dubuffet.
	   It's spontaneous, exuberant and has wide appeal, with wild
animals, human heads, body parts - even boats and mountain tops
popping up everywhere.
	   Among the show's highlights is ``Aztec Volcano'' (1971) - a
splash of lime green shot through with an imaginary orange fauve,
framed with small boxes of simple, circular forms.
	   His ``Central Park'' series are also on display, marking the
first of many paintings made from thin paper transposed onto
canvass. They too are bordered with his signature black-and-white
ink drawings recalling cartoon strips.
	   Alechinsky has enjoyed huge critical and commercial success
since he burst onto the international scene in the 1950s.

 &UR; By DOUGLAS J. ROWE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ John Frankenheimer offers what sounds like a
variation of the old borscht belt joke: ``I've been rich, and I've
been poor, and let me tell ya: rich is better!'' He even cracks up
at his own punch line.
	   But he is being serious, talking about his up-and-down career.
``I remember the despair and I remember the triumph. And of the two
I like the triumph,'' he says, laughing.
	   ``You know, Yul Brynner, my very, very dear friend, said to me,
`There's one thing in life that you can be sure of _ and really
only one thing _ and that is, no matter how things are now, whether
they're good or whether they're bad, they're going to change. You
can be sure of that.' I just hope the good part lasts a little
longer.''
	   The good part has lasted for a while now. He has won Emmys for
directing cable-TV movies four of the last five years (the most
recent: last month for ``George Wallace,'' which also won a Peabody
Award and a Golden Globe for best television film).
	   And now his comeback has culminated in ``Ronin,'' a thriller
about post-Cold War mercenaries starring Robert De Niro and Jean
Reno. Reviewers generally saw it as a ``return to form'' for
Frankenheimer as a director of theatrical films, and the movie
grossed dlrs 13 million in its opening weekend, making it No. 2 at
the box office.
	   Frankenheimer sees this as the best stretch of his career _
quite an assessment given that he had a highly regarded run of
feature films in the 1960s, and an impressive string of 152 live
television dramas in the '50s.
	   ``This is better,'' he says. ``I appreciate it more, too.''
	   That's because he once thought he would never enjoy a thriving,
successful career again.
	   ``To have it happen again, that's a dream come true.''
	   Inevitably, if you keep at it for 44 years, as he has, there
have to be peaks and valleys, the 68-year-old director says. ``This
is not the insurance business. I don't just write insurance
policies. This is highly volatile, emotional stuff. You go up and
you go down. And you go down and you go up. Thank God I've been
able to ride the wave.''
	   Born in New York to a stockbroker-father of German-Jewish origin
and an Irish-Catholic mother, Frankenheimer attended Williams
College in Massachusetts and made training films in the Air Force.
He decided he wanted to direct and landed a job at CBS in 1954. He
worked as an assistant director on ``Person to Person'' and other
shows before moving up to direct ``Playhouse '90'' and other
anthologies.
	   He then established himself as one of Hollywood's foremost
directors.
	   As producer Frank Mancuso Jr. puts it, ``He made the template''
for political thrillers with ``Seven Days in May'' and ``The
Manchurian Candidate,'' now regarded as classics. His works also
encompassed social dramas (``Birdman of Alcatraz,'' ``All Fall
Down'') and action pictures (``Grand Prix'').
	   In the '70s, though, he ran into some personal difficulties,
including a drinking problem, which followed the assassination of
close friend Robert F. Kennedy. Kennedy was staying at
Frankenheimer's house, and Frankenheimer drove him to the
Ambassador Hotel the night he was killed in 1968.
	   Frankenheimer lost his touch, making such clunkers as
``Prophecy,'' ``The Challenge,'' ``Dead-Bang'' and ``Year of the
Gun.''
	   Job offers dried up in the '80s, and Frankenheimer, who has been
married to Evans Evans for 37 years and has two daughters from a
previous marriage, worked to re-establish himself.
	   That down period, he says, ``seems like yesterday.''
	   ``And I don't kid myself. I know it can happen again. So I
really enjoy what's happening now.''
	   That is why the man who still drives high-powered cars for fun _
he even has his competition license and recently went to
drag-racing school _ says there's no cruise-control for him. It's
pedal to the metal.
	   ``Full bore. You gotta give it everything. You just got to give
it everything,'' he says, emphasizing each word in the last
sentence. ``And sometimes that's not even enough.''
	   As in some of his previous films, the characters in his latest
feature display dueling traits of paranoia and anguish. You see the
fatigue on their faces.
	   ``It's kind of an ennui,'' Frankenheimer suggests.
	   And the reason that intrigues him?
	   ``Because I feel it's me,'' he almost shouts, as if an admission
has been wheedled out of him. ``I feel I'm partially eroded, too,
you know.''
	   Frankenheimer even identifies with the movie's metaphorical
title, ``Ronin.'' It was the name given to samurai in feudal Japan
when they suffered the shame of failing in their sworn duty of
protecting their liege-lord and letting him get killed. (They were
then forced to wander the land looking for work as bandits or hired
swords.)
	   ``If you take CBS television as the liege-lord, you know,'' he
says, referring to his early days as a director on the network,
``we were all kind of cut loose when live television ended. And
you're out there trying to fend for yourself and work for other
masters. ... Yeah, I identify very strongly with this movie.
There's a lot of me in it.''
	   Besides his fondness for fast cars, he loves making miniatures,
so he gave a character that hobby; and since he loves ice skating
and follows it faithfully, he set an assassination scene against
the backdrop of the sport, giving him a reason to cast beautiful
Olympic champion Katarina Witt. Plus, he shot the film in France,
where he lived for several years and which he still loves.
	   Frankenheimer's next feature film will be ``The Good Shepherd,''
about the first 20 years of the CIA, and he's negotiating an
exclusive arrangement with TNT to produce and direct films for
cable.

Good enough to eat? Scrumptious exhibit explores food as artwork

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Like a huge, five-course Thanksgiving
dinner, a museum exhibit dedicated to what we eat is challenging
the idea that food fails to satisfy as a subject of artistic
expression.
	   ``A Feast for the Eye: Food in Art,'' is a mouthwatering
collection of 250 works, few of them the still lifes that people
might expect.
	   How about boxes of Ritz crackers stacked in a supermarket aisle?
Or two starving men in turn-of-the-century France boiling shoe
leather in a giant kettle? How about a handbag that looks like a
loaf of bread?
	   All are represented in the exhibit opening Saturday that
continues through Dec. 13 at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in
Golden Gate Park.
	   Cartoons, photographs, short films, dishware and paintings are
just some of the works that illustrate the serious and humorous
sides of food as a symbol of wealth and status, as well as a
commentary on those left powerless without food.
	   ``I would like people to take away some of the deeper subjects
but also to really be able to kick back and say, `Holy cow! A hat
that looks like a head of lettuce,''' curator Melissa Leventon
says.
	   Ms. Leventon, a self-described amateur chef, first came up with
the idea more than a year ago as a way to showcase the museum's
permanent collection.
	   There's no catalog, but the exhibit was timed to coincide with a
cookbook published by the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. A
recipe for stuffed fillet of sole is displayed opposite Gunter
Grass' 1978 surreal etching, ``Man in Flounder.''
	   Ms. Leventon had hoped to include artwork of actual food but
could not because of potential problems with ants, spiders and
silverfish at the aging museum.
	   The pieces are laid out according to the metaphor of a meal,
beginning with food and drink, continuing with dining, tableware
and subjects for dinner conversation. The final serving is a kind
of after-dinner entertainment, an outrageous look at food as art,
including a coat made to look like cabbage and a short film showing
the effects of sour candy balls on children.
	   One critic, Jonathon Keats of San Francisco magazine, complained
the exhibit misses the mark because it is organized by subject
matter.
	   ``While there's nothing wrong with displaying objects in an
anthropological context, just as there's nothing wrong with eating
a can of soup for lunch, these are not things you do in a fine arts
museum,'' Keats wrote.
	   Stomachs may growl as visitors gaze at William J. McCloskey's
sensuous painting, ``Oranges in Tissue Paper'' or David Gilhooly's
cartoonlike ``My Daily Bread,'' which depicts a gargantuan sandwich
that looks like something Dagwood would eat.
	   Then there's Marianne Boers' screen prints of boxes of Ritz
crackers in a supermarket and bottles of Perrier water. Ms.
Leventon said the artwork includes the hidden message that our
society has become dependent on mass-produced food and drink.
	   There also are sobering images _ a 1949 photograph of a British
family eating in squalor, and an Italian POW's book of recipes
meticulously collected from fellow prisoners' memories of their
mothers' cooking.
	   Decorative arts on display include a 19th-century Peruvian
silver spice box that has a lock and key because spices were scarce
at the time. Ms. Leventon said the majority of such pieces were
intended for use at dinner tables, something that is lost when it
becomes labeled artwork.
	   ``You can look at a silver sauce boat and you can admire the
beautiful chasing and molding,'' she said. ``But you can also
understand that this is something that somebody put gravy in and
picked up and poured gravy over whatever was on their plate. This
was a useful item.''

<TEXT>
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Even before the first rehearsal, Gerard Schwarz
could hear the difference.
	   As the Seattle Symphony Orchestra musicians tuned up, each
instrument could be heard clearly and distinctly. The tonal quality
was luminous, warm and rich, evenly distributed wherever the music
director stood.
	   To Schwarz, 51, who made the orchestra a recording powerhouse
with 70 CDs in a dozen years, the new Benaroya Hall was everything
he had envisioned.
	   ``It's the most beautiful sound I ever heard,'' he said. ``It's
a very warm sound _ lush, reverberant, gorgeous sound. It also has
clarity. Usually, if you have warm and rich and lush, it's a moosh,
it's a mess _ or, if it's clear, it sounds too dry.
	   ``This hall has both, which is amazing. You almost never hear
it.''
	   The dlrs 132.4 million complex, mostly funded by private
sources, lights up a once drab and dangerous downtown area visually
as well as musically.
	   ``It just heralds a whole new era in everything we do, a whole
new impact,'' said Schwarz, who also has been music director of the
New York Chamber Orchestra since 1976 and of the Mostly Mozart
Festival at Lincoln Center in New York since 1982.
	   ``It's been a great orchestra driving a Chevy,'' architect Mark
Reddington said. ``They now have a Maserati.'' Acoustical
consultant Cyril M. Harris also worked on the project.
	   With 17 percent fewer seats than the Seattle Center Opera House
that formerly was its home, the symphony has booked 30 percent more
performances, boosted musicians' base pay from dlrs 43,000 a year
to dlrs 55,350 by 2000 and increased the operating budget from last
year's dlrs 11.5 million to dlrs 15.5 million in 1998-99.
	   The eagerly awaited move was celebrated last month with eight
days of concerts, banquets, speeches and tours. The Northwest
Chamber Orchestra, Seattle Men's Chorus, Seattle Classical Guitar
Society and Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra performed in the house
that Schwarz built.
	   The former trumpeter made public appearances and corporate
visits, did government lobbying and held dinner meetings at his
home to ensure the project. His work resulted in the largest gift
to a nonprofit group in city history _ dlrs 15 million from his
good friends Rebecca and Jack Benaroya, a self-made business-park
developer. The longtime benefactors of the arts and children's
medicine requested anonymity, but Schwarz persuaded them that their
donation would be more compelling to other contributors if their
identity was known. The project bears their name.
	   Schwarz's lobbying also produced:
	   _ dlrs 63 million from other private parties, including at least
dlrs 1 million each from nearly two dozen individuals, businesses
and foundations, with key help from arts benefactors Bagley and
Virginia Wright.
	   _Site approval and dlrs 40.8 million from the city, which owns
the building.
	   _Promises of more than dlrs 13 million from the state and King
County.
	   _ dlrs 4.5 million from the Boeing Co., which also provided
project management.
	   The project was completed on schedule but the budget grew as new
features were added.
	   The resulting edifice stands in marked contrast to
self-contained complexes such as Kennedy Center in Washington,
D.C., and Lincoln Center in New York, each ``in its little separate
environment,'' Reddington said.
	   ``Here it's right in the middle of the city and it's part of the
daily life of the city ... a very important accomplishment in the
world of music-hall development.''
	   At the base of the building, where prostitutes, pimps and drug
dealers once congregated before the Seattle Art Museum was built
across the street in 1991, is a dlrs 3.6 million Garden of
Remembrance for Washington state citizens who died in wars.
	   A steep block uphill, across from the dingy main downtown post
office, ticket buyers enter a striking enclosed arcade. At each end
hangs a 20-foot Dale Chihuly blown-glass chandelier. On a terrace
outside rests the museum's ``Schubert Sonata,'' a 22-foot abstract
steel Mark di Suvero sculpture that moves in the wind.
	   The south side of the arcade opens into a semicircular
glassed-in lobby, the most distinctive feature from outside. It
resembles a ship's pilot house by day and a glittering lantern by
night. Views extend past the Seattle Art Museum to Puget Sound and
upward through a cluster of skyscrapers.
	   Over the entrance to the 2,502-seat auditorium is ``Echo,'' the
largest work by Robert Rauschenberg, a melange of musical, pastoral
and urban subjects on nine 5-by-12-foot polylaminate panels.
	   The main hall is sealed against outside sound and vibration.
Weighing 13,500 tons, the chamber rests on 310 rubber bearings,
each 7 inches high and 15 inches square, with lateral rubber
bracing against earthquakes.
	   At the rear of the stage rises the facade of an 88-stop,
4,500-pipe organ being built for about dlrs 2.5 million by C.B.
Fisk Inc. of Gloucester, Mass. Completion is set for July 2000.
	   An unusually high proscenium enhances a sense of drama and
feeling of intimacy, and the wall and ceiling coffers bulge with
triangular wooden panels to help distribute the sound.
	   The building includes a 541-seat recital hall, and a dlrs 1
million music education center is scheduled for completion in a
year.

Asbury Park's latest casualty _ The Stone Pony

<TEXT>
	   ASBURY PARK, New Jersey (AP) _ The marquee promised a local
hero, shore favorite John Eddie. Instead, on a summer night in
1984, the crowd inside the Stone Pony went berserk as _ surprise! _
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band stepped on stage.
	   As the first notes of ``Thunder Road'' echoed through the
cramped club, Eddie _ who had graciously accommodated the Boss by
shifting from headliner to opening act _ surveyed the
near-hysterical audience.
	   ``I remember thinking, `That's rock 'n' roll,''' he says now.
	   That was the music and the magic of the Pony, a Jersey shore
institution since 1974. The cheap little seaside bar evolved into a
national rock 'n' roll landmark, the place that temporarily turned
Asbury Park into Liverpool, New Jersey.
	   But the town has changed, and the times have changed, and the
music has changed, too. The Stone Pony, the site of so much local
music history, is now history itself, its endless summer finally
ending after 24 years.
	   Closing night was Sept. 20, and the mourners turned out for
``The Pony's Last Ride.'' They were treated to a final surprise
guest _ Southside Johnny Lyon, who did three songs with shore-scene
mainstays, the Bobby Bandiera Band.
	   ``The place had a rep. It had its own kind of identity,'' says
Marshall Crenshaw, a frequent Pony performer who once shared its
stage with Springsteen. ``The people had a sort of allegiance to
the place, you know? There was kind of a pride about the club.''
	   Now there's a new name: Vinyl. And there's a new sound: dance
music. The stained glass pony behind the main bar is gone, headed
eventually to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.
	   There was no place like the Pony, wedged just opposite the
Boardwalk's miniature golf course on Ocean Avenue.
	   On a Jersey summer night, with 1,000 folks jammed inside the
half-block long club, beer and perspiration flowed in equal,
extraordinary amounts. Fans leaned against the cramped stage, their
heroes an arm's length away.
	   The club was more than a musicians' hangout for local acts from
New Jersey; the Pony became a stop for national acts. Elvis
Costello, Paul Westerberg, Todd Rundgren, the Ramones, Nils Lofgren
and Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish were among its headliners.
	   But it was the local guys _ Springsteen, Southside Johnny,
Little Steven Van Zandt, Jon Bon Jovi _ who brought the attitude
and the attention to Asbury Park.
	   Music executives soon came to town, looking for ``the next Bruce
Springsteen.'' Some bands signed deals; others, like Lord Gunner
and the Shots, never quite made it. But stars and local scenesters
always mixed comfortably at the Pony.
	   To see Springsteen transform from rock star/stadium icon to
bar-band guitarist, cranking out cover tunes like ``Twist and
Shout,'' was simply mind-boggling. Bruce showed up eight times in
the summer of '82 to jam with local bands.
	   ``The word would get out if Springsteen was playing _ there was
like a little network,'' said Mike Glynn, 36, a Pony regular from
the early 1980s. ``The place would fill right up.''
	   The Pony opened as a new spot on the old Asbury Park scene once
dominated by legendary, long-gone local outlets like The Upstage
and The Student Prince.
	   While commonly thought of as ``The House That Bruce Built,''
Springsteen and the E Street Band were touring when the club made
its debut. It was Bruce's buddy, Southside Johnny, who most often
took the stage; his Asbury Jukes became the house band.
	   When the Jukes released their first album in 1976, they
celebrated with a Memorial Day live broadcast from the Pony.
Springsteen joined them to play Sam Cooke's classic ``Havin' a
Party.''
	   ``There's something about standing on that stage, with the
audience right there, the people almost on stage,'' Southside said
shortly after one legendary 1991 Pony gig. ``I like to hang out on
that stage.''
	   That night, he played with Springsteen, Little Steven, Bon Jovi
and E Street band members Garry Tallent and Max Weinberg _ a who's
who of Jersey rock.
	   ``Where you there?'' asks Bon Jovi's manager, Paul Cruscillos,
still disbelieving seven years later. ``It was incredible.''
	   Within days of that show, though, the club went into bankruptcy
and closed. It reopened a year later when a local businessman,
Steven Nasar, bought the shuttered club. Nasar had never been in
the bar business, had never been inside the Stone Pony. But his
first visit to the club convinced him to make an investment.
	   ``It was a very strange feeling of home and rock 'n' roll,'' he
said at the time.
	   But the better-known bands rarely hit Asbury Park anymore. The
surrounding neighborhood, a depressing glut of abandoned hotels,
arcades and storefronts, is so barren that a tumbleweed could now
roll unnoticed down Ocean Avenue.
	   Madame Marie, the resident Boardwalk fortuneteller, saw the
future and left; her small white booth sits lonely at the north end
of the block. The Pony's exterior was blighted with graffiti, and
its familiar white marquee held just a single, misspelled message:
	   ``BAR OPE''.
	   The local music scene changed, too, and the Pony began booking
hard-core acts. ``They turned the Stone Pony into a mess,'' Nasar
complained, citing damage to the bathrooms and ceilings.
	   Springsteen's last Pony appearance came in October 1995, a show
with Pittsburgh rocker Joe Grushecky. In recent years, the Boss'
stops were elsewhere on the Jersey shore, in Long Branch or Sea
Bright.

'Happiness' is anything but
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY351 &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL FLEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Entertainment Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ After the Cannes Film Festival, the future
looked bright for ``Happiness,'' the pitch-black comedy about the
bleak underside of suburbia.
	   Despite its troubling subject, the film won critical raves and a
festival prize, positioning it as a movie to watch this year.
	   ``I certainly thought it was a film that would cause controversy
and that people were going to be split on it,'' producer Christine
Vachon said. ``But it never occurred to me that what happened would
happen. Suddenly, we were a little blind-sided.''
	   October Films, which had financed the dlrs 2.5 million picture
and which had been enthusiastic about it, abruptly backed out of
distributing ``Happiness,'' apparently under pressure from nervous
officials at parent Universal Studios or Universal's owner,
Canadian-based Seagram Co.
	   The content may have been too much for the corporate bosses.
``Happiness'' deals with rape, pedophilia, masturbation and murder.
It was clearly destined for an NC-17 rating, which is considered
box-office poison because it means a movie will not be shown in
many multiplexes or advertised in some newspapers.
	   But there's a happy ending for ``Happiness.'' The producers set
up their own distribution outlet and the movie will now reach
theaters Oct. 16.
	   But the experience raised questions about the fate of other edgy
films _ particularly those that don't enjoy such critical support _
in this era of art-house studios being owned by publicly traded
corporations such as Seagram, the Walt Disney Co., News Corp. and
Viacom.
	   ``It has a chilling effect on the decision-makers who might
otherwise embrace interesting and provocative work, and now are
shyer about doing it,'' said James Schamus, whose company, Good
Machine, is releasing ``Happiness'' without a rating from the
Motion Picture Association of America.
	   A spokeswoman for October said the studio would have no comment.
Universal did not have an immediate response.
	   Todd Solondz, who also directed the critically acclaimed
``Welcome to the Dollhouse'' (1996), said he holds no grudges.
	   ``These things happen,'' he said. ``And in my case, in a certain
sense, it worked out for the best... I only see the up, for me
personally.''
	   But for the industry, he said, ``it's about the bottom line. If
the movie turns out to be profitable, it will make it less
difficult for other filmmakers with similar difficult subjects and
taboo subject matter to get financing.''
	   ``Happiness'' has already received a big boost from critics and
audiences at influential film festivals. At Cannes last spring, it
received the Critic's Prize. And last month at the Toronto Film
Festival, it won the Metro Media Award, voted on by the 740 writers
and critics attending the event.
	   ``Happiness'' is part of the darkening trend in independent
films in recent years, with movies exploring such subjects as mass
murder and sexual deviances, often in the context of a comedy.
Among the current movies looking on the dark side are ``Very Bad
Things,'' ``Jerry and Tom'' and ``Thursday.''
	   But ``Happiness'' stands out.
	   The main character is Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker), a therapist
and a pedophile-rapist, and the story focuses on how people put on
a happy public face while struggling with private turmoil.
	   There are Bill's deluded wife Trish (Cynthia Stevenson), his
sexually confused son Billy (Rufus Read) and the wife's two
sisters: a glamorous author, Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle), who is oddly
attracted to an obscene phone caller, and the underachieving Joy
(Jane Adams), who has a catastrophic love life. Added to the mix
are the lonely, perverted apartment dweller Allen (Phillip Seymour
Hoffman) and his neighbor Kristina (Camryn Manheim), who has
something very awful in her refrigerator.
	   The idea for the movie began to take form as Solondz read an
article about a Russian serial killer of children. ``While you read
about serial killers all the time, at the end of the long article
they said that he had a wife and two children,'' Solondz recalled.
``I just had to wonder: What does that mean?''
	   And, so, ``Happiness'' gives us Bill Maplewood, who would appear
to have everything: a loving family, a nice home in the New Jersey
suburbs, a respected career. Bill also is sexually attracted to
young boys, including his son's school friends.
	   ``I didn't want to make a movie about a pedophile. I'm not
interested in pedophiles, per se,'' said Solondz. ``I see it more
as a device, a tool, to explore the issues that are of greater
interest to me, which have to do with emotional connection and
alienation.''
	   There are no scenes of Maplewood acting on his sexual impulses.
But the subject matter is handled in a disturbing fashion _ made
all the more difficult with the scenes played out as comedy and
tragedy, inviting the audience to sympathize with a pedophile.
	   ``It's hard for me to separate what I find funny from what I am
moved by, and I would find the movie unbearable if it lacks
humor,'' said Solondz. ``There is a certain kind of tension, and
it's not a yuck-yuck sort of humor. ... And while there may be
humor in the movie, I want to emphasize, for me, it's never a joke.
It is all serious.''

Five Questions with Natascha McElhone: going top speed in her
</HEADLINE>
'vroom vroom' &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photo NY337 &QL; 
 &UR; By CAROL DEEGAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In John Frankenheimer's new film, ``Ronin,'' a
tough team of ex-government spooks is assembled in a warehouse in
Paris. Their job: to steal a mysterious metal case, wanted by both
the Irish and the Russians.
	   Brought together by Natascha McElhone's tough-talking character,
Deirdre, these international guns-for-hire know nothing about one
another's backgrounds, what is in the metal case or who has hired
them. (The title of the film is the Japanese word for samurai
shamed by the loss of their masters who wander the land seeking
work as mercenaries.)
	   Frankenheimer sends the cast, which includes Robert De Niro,
Jean Reno and Stellan Skarsgard, speeding through the narrow
streets and underground tunnels of Nice and Paris in a several
sensational car chases.
	   ``I spent a fair amount of time in my vroom-vroom, but I really
got a kick out of it, because I'd never done a movie like this
before or been required to be this sort of pro-active character who
leads a car chase or who, you know, holds a gun up to people's
heads, and that was really interesting,'' said McElhone, whose
previous films include ``Surviving Picasso'' opposite Anthony
Hopkins and ``The Truman Show'' with Jim Carrey.
	   Her family is Irish, but she grew up in London, where she
studied at the London Academy of Music and Drama for three years.
Her early stage credits include ``Richard III,'' ``The Count of
Monte Cristo,'' ``The Cherry Orchard'' and ``Midsummer Night's
Dream.''
	   Since filming on ``Ronin'' was completed, McElhone has been busy
``reading lots of things and doing some window shopping.''
	   1. What was it like to work with such an international cast?
	   McElhone: I loved that sort of melting pot that John
(Frankenheimer) created by bringing us all together from such
different backgrounds with different movies that we'd been in. And
I think that sort of added to the suspense aspect of the movie that
among the characters, no one trusted anyone, everyone was trying to
figure out the next one and trying to get one step ahead of the
next person and watching their backs.
	   2. How were the car chases?
	   McElhone: We all did a little driving, but usually just
pull-aways and kind of screeching to a halt, not the stuff going
down the tunnel against one-way traffic. But we were all in the
car, so there was a fake driving steering wheel, and I was miming
what the guy next to me who was really driving was doing. So it was
quite interesting because you're there and you're getting all his
energy. You know exactly when to turn and you feel like you're
doing it. And you start pushing false pedals because you're trying
to control where the car's going, it's a really funny sensation.
	   2 1-2 . So you trusted the driver?
	   McElhone: I really trusted him, and he was extraordinary, his
reflexes are unparalleled, thank God. He's a Formula One driver, so
that was pretty incredible, that stuff.
	   3. How would you compare filming ``Ronin'' with ``Surviving
Picasso,'' two completely different movies?
	   McElhone: It was like sort of a full circle for me because Nice
and Paris are the two places where I shot 'Picasso' and yet I
couldn't have been on a more different movie playing a different
character.
	   4. What was it like to work with filmmaker James Ivory on
``Surviving Picasso''?
	   McElhone: James Ivory, basically, he's my fairy godmother
because he took a risk, he took a huge risk. I'd never done a film
in my life, ever, and yet he let me play the lead role in the
movie.
	   5. What's next?
	   McElhone: I'd love to do something as contrasting as 'Truman'
was with 'Ronin.' I'd love to try and take another right- or
left-hand turn and not carry on on the same street, if you need a
'Ronin' car analogy. But to me, as long as it's different and I
think the script is good _ that's always crucial, crucial, crucial
_ I think if the story is worth telling, that's enough. I don't
mind if it's a tiny part, if it's a huge role, none of that really
concerns me. It's much more important that it's going to take to me
to a place I haven't yet visited, and I mean that metaphorically
rather than physically.

Patti LaBelle _ still going strong

<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ At any given performance, Patti LaBelle may
invite awestruck fans on stage for an impromptu shimmy-and-shake or
to take part in an improvised duet on the chorus of one of her many
signature songs.
	   That's typical Patti LaBelle.
	   It is her live performances that highlight her originality,
spontaneity and enviable vocal range and give her a chance to just
... be.
	   Her genuine, unaffected nature comes across in those
soul-stirring shows that continue to wring the spectrum of emotions
from fans after nearly four decades in the business.
	   And at 54, LaBelle is as busy now as she was earlier in her
career. This year's agenda has already included the Essence Music
Festival in New Orleans and a PBS TV special with superstars Luther
Vandross and Mariah Carey.
	   Her autobiography, ``Don't Block the Blessings,'' is a best
seller. She's also writing a cookbook, due for release in 1999, and
working on a new album showcasing her Gospel roots.
	   She's also involved in a variety of causes, including fighting
cancer, which claimed the lives of her three sisters, AIDS,
diabetes and homelessness.
	   Although her manager/husband Armstead Edwards has tried to
persuade her to slow her touring schedule, she spends about nine
months each year performing to sold-out audiences.
	   ``It's not as if I can't get three meals a day, but if I didn't
perform, I think I would get ill,'' LaBelle said in an interview.
``It keeps me young. I just love the audience participation, it
turns me on. I can't live without it and I won't try.''
	   What about time spent in the recording studio?
	   ``I hate recording,'' she laughed.
	   ``I love to sing, but going into a studio is like going to
prison. You have a producer who makes you do (the song) in a
particular way and I know he's right. But sometimes he may keep you
on a song too long and sometimes you can go in and do it in one
take. It's those 100 takes that I can't handle girlfriend, whereas
on stage, I can just be myself.''
	   ``Lady Marmalade'' was LaBelle's first No. 1 hit. Other song
triumphs range from show-stopper ``Over the Rainbow'' to upbeat
``New Attitude'' to her latest funky hit ``When You Talk About
Love,'' from her current album ``Flame.''
	   That variety plus sticking to music she considers ``age
appropriate'' helps with fan approval. But LaBelle added: ``I'm not
looking for any old woman music, though.''
	   Asked to reflect on her longevity in the music business, LaBelle
paused.
	   ``Girlfriend, I think about that every day,'' she said quietly.
``I think about how wonderful it is that the public is still
accepting me. It's as if they don't see me as a 54-year-old woman,
but they see me as their girlfriend, as their mother or their
sister.
	   ``They just love me and I don't feel as if I have to prove
myself to them. They love me for me. They love me anyway.''

	   In the spotlight: Toni Braxton, makin' us high
	    &UR; Image: Known as a doe-eyed, sultry-voiced, multiplatinum
beauty, Toni Braxton has received almost as much attention for her
physical appearance as she has for her voice. Her numerous
quick-changes into revealing outfits have won over crowds, and
People magazine's list of the 50 Most Beautiful People in the World
has included her name.
	    &UR; Personal stats: Born in Severn, Maryland, on Oct. 7, 1968,
Braxton and her four younger sisters grew up singing in church
choirs. As a child, she was not allowed to listen to secular music
or watch much television. Frivolity was discouraged. She wore only
plain dresses until she was 12.
	    &UR; Breakout: Her big break came when Anita Baker couldn't fulfill
a commitment to sing on ``Boomerang,'' the soundtrack for the 1992
Eddie Murphy movie. A bluesy torch song, ``Love Shoulda Brought You
Home Last Night,'' and ``Give U My Heart,'' a duet with Kenny
``Babyface'' Edmonds, were perfect for Braxton's smoky voice.
	   Edmonds and producer L.A. Reid had signed Braxton as a solo
artist to their LaFace Records in 1991.
	   Her self-titled debut album, released in 1993, sold more than 10
million copies worldwide in the following two years. Her second
album, ``Secrets,'' which was supported by sexy videos, was also a
hit with the singles ``You're Makin' Me High _ Let It Flow'' and
``Un-break My Heart.'' She won Female Rhythm and Blues Artist of
the Year at the 1997 Billboard Music Awards.
	    &UR; Quote: ``I'm not a diva. I'm a tadpole trying to be a frog.''

	   ``Saturday Night'' (RCA Victor) _ World Premiere Recording
	   Brooklyn. 1929. Before the big stock market crash. When the
biggest worry for a young man was, ``What can you do on a Saturday
night _ alone?''
	   An unlikely subject for a musical by Stephen Sondheim, the
master of cynical sophistication, urban angst and unresolved
passion.
	   Yet before there was ``Sweeney Todd,'' ``Follies,'' ``Company''
or even ``West Side Story,'' there was ``Saturday Night,'' a
mid-1950s Sondheim musical that never made it to Broadway because
of the unexpected death of its producer.
	   Cheerfully nostalgic, a bit brash and even sweet, this first
big-time Sondheim show was finally staged last year by a tiny
British company _ the Bridewell _ in London.
	   The Bridewell's efforts were recorded and, if more enthusiastic
than accomplished, offer a fascinating preview of the talent who
would become the dominant figure in American musical theater in the
last three decades of the 20th century.
	   From its catchy title number with its jaunty ragtime piano
refrain to several poignant love songs, the score radiates an
optimism not found in much of the master's later works.
	   If the humor seems a bit forced, the emotion of the more serious
songs is honest and open _ coupled with a strong sense of melody.
Several songs are highly moving, particularly ``So Many People''
and ``All for You.'' The later is a haunting hymn of devotion, sung
by Anna Francolini.
	   A surprising recording then, one that has its hero and heroine
ending the show, singing, ``With your love what more do I need?''
Not a question that you would expect the more mature, world-weary
Sondheim to be asking, even rhetorically.
	   _ By Michael Kuchwara, AP Drama Critic.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Gentleman's Blues'' (Virgin) _ Cracker
	   All signs were that David Lowry would come full circle with the
next Cracker album. After hinting for two works, he would finally
resurrect the quirky sound of his first band, Camper Van Beethoven.
	   Instead, Cracker delivers a love letter to late 1960s, early
1970s rock with ``Gentleman's Blues,'' a 17-song CD that took its
blueprint right from the Rolling Stones' ``Exile in Main Street.''
	   The foundation for these tunes is American blues and roots rock,
mining ground of not only the Stones but Neil Young, Janis Joplin,
the Allman Brothers and Creedence Clearwater Revival.
	   Cracker's fourth effort is its most mature and even-keeled work,
but the collection of songs here do not stand up to the band's 1993
commercial breakthrough, ``Kerosene Hat,'' or the stellar ``The
Golden Age'' from two years ago.
	   Both those works were more original, showcasing Lowry's barbed
lyricism and the creative lazy dog strumming of guitarist Johnny
Hickman. They also sometimes employed the bizarre arrangements that
made Camper an underground god.
	   Only one song on this new CD _ the cloying ``I Want Out of the
Circus'' _ sounds at all like Camper.
	   But if you ache for some new songs in the old AOR genre, Cracker
does deliver on ``Gentleman's Blues.'' Fueled by Frank Funaro's
inspired drumming, the band's one-two punch of ``Seven Days'' and
``Star'' are growling rockers, and don't miss the hidden untitled
Joplin-inspired track at the end.
	   And maybe it's time to put Camper to rest. Cracker has created
more LPs and as much interesting music. And as Lowry is apt to
point out, Cracker is far more commercially successful.
	   _ By John Pacenti, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Dreams to Remember _ The Otis Redding Anthology'' (Rhino) _
Otis Redding
	   Otis Redding once released an album titled ``Dictionary of
Soul.'' Here's his abridged encyclopedia of soul.
	   When Redding died in a plane crash in 1967, he was just 26 years
old. And yet the 50 songs on the two-CD compilation ``Dreams to
Remember'' sound ageless. These selections _ distilled from a
four-CD box set released in 1993 _ remain compelling three decades
after they were recorded, and it's likely they'll still seem fresh
a hundred years from now.
	   There are dance tunes (``Shake,'' ``Love Man,'' ``Respect''),
love ballads (``These Arms of Mine,'' ``I've Been Loving You Too
Long,'' ``I Can't Turn You Loose'') and overlooked gems (``Trick or
Treat,'' ``Lovey Dovey,'' ``The Match Game''). The common thread is
a steamy soul sound.
	   The absence of any tunes from ``Live in Europe,'' one of the
greatest concert recordings in pop history, is a glaring omission.
But five songs from Redding's frenetic performance at the 1967
Monterey Pop Festival are included. And on the studio cuts, Redding
is backed by the legendary Memphis ensemble of Steve Cropper, Duck
Dunn, Al Jackson and Booker T. Jones.
	   It's amazing: From a singer who has been dead nearly 30 years,
each song sounds like a slice of soul heaven.
	   _ By Steven Wine, Associated Press Writer.

 &UR; Eds: movie opened Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By MALCOLM RITTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ What do you get when you cross Woody Allen with
an ant? One very funny movie.
	   ``Antz,'' a computer-animated feature from DreamWorks Pictures
and PDI, is a delightful blend of Allenesque verbal humor and a
clever, insect-eye view of the world.
	   Woody Allen fans will find plenty of their hero in Z (voiced by
Allen), who is dissatisfied with being a worker ant. His colony is
a Dilbert version of hell: hordes of ants doing mindless work,
driven not by whips and chains but by culture and heavy-handed
management techniques.
	   At one point, they must swarm together to form a wrecking ball.
Their foreman (voiced by Grant Shaud, in a role reminiscent of his
Miles Silverberg on TV's ``Murphy Brown'') tries to motivate them
with a New Age-ish mantra: ``Be the ball!''
	   Z falls in love with the colony's Princess Bala (voiced by
Sharon Stone) and, just to see her again, he crosses a forbidden
social divide to become a soldier ant. He unwittingly becomes a war
hero and threatens to block the evil plan of General Mandible
(voiced by Gene Hackman), who wants to kill all the workers. In the
end, Z shows true courage and organizes his fellow workers in a
bold stroke that saves them all.
	   The screenplay, by Todd Alcott and Chris and Paul Weitz, gives Z
lines that ring true for Allen as insect. The movie opens with Z in
a psychotherapy session, complaining that as the middle child in a
family of several million, he never got any attention. When some
fellow insects interrupt his tete-a-tete with Princess Bala to ask
a favor, Z grumbles, ``Ever wonder why they call you guys pests?''
	   The movie is most creative when it portrays an ant's perspective
on the world. At a human picnic, for example, Princess Bala gets
stuck on the sole of a sneaker as its owner walks along. From the
viewpoint of Bala and Z, who tries frantically to save her, two
shoes become the vehicles of a terrifying thrill ride. We humans
can only laugh in recognition and appreciation.
	   The computer animation is superb. You can feel the texture of
the ant bodies. Don't expect scientific accuracy here: The ants
walk upright and show space-alien faces, with big eyes and
humanlike mouths and teeth.
	   Kids will like this movie. Z's musings and the mushy romance
parts pass quickly enough for them. Young children might be
frightened by a harrowing battle scene, followed by Z's decapitated
buddy dying on camera after imparting some advice. Another buddy is
roughed up during an interrogation, and there is some mild
profanity.
	   But the movie emphasizes the importance of thinking for yourself
while showing that sometimes, it takes teamwork to get things done.
Not a bad topic to discuss on the way home.
	   ``Antz'' is directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson, and
produced by Brad Lewis, Aron Warner and Patty Wooton.

At the Movies: 'What Dreams May Come'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Film opened Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB THOMAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A movie with heaven, hell and Robin Williams. It
sounds like an irresistible combination.
	   And yet ... .
	   ``What Dreams May Come'' turns out to be as murky and undefining
as its title. In his most tragic role (unless you count ``Father's
Day''), Williams cannot be faulted. He reveals a deep humanity as
he faces the trials of Job. But even such an accomplished actor
cannot overcome what has all the earmarks of an instant cult film.
	   Chris (Williams) and Annie (Annabella Sciorra) meet cute, as the
cliche goes, when their small boats collide on a Swiss lake. They
quickly fall in love, marry and flash forward to an upscale life
with two handsome teen-agers (Jessica Brooks Grant and Josh
Paddock).
	   The family seems ideal: Chris is a successful doctor, Annie is
an accomplished painter who works in an art gallery, and their son
and daughter have the usual teen problems, nothing serious. The
ominous tone of the film indicates such serenity can't last.
	   A tragedy engulfs the parents, and then Chris is killed trying
to help victims of a car crash. A mystery figure named Albert (Cuba
Gooding Jr.) conducts him to heaven.
	   Chris is astounded to see that heaven is a copy of Annie's
paintings of mountains and lakes. When his beloved dog comes
leaping out of the bushes, Chris mutters, ``I screwed up; I'm in
dog heaven.''
	   That's about the only levity in ``What Dreams May Come.'' When
Chris learns that Annie has been consigned to hell, he resolves to
find her. Albert agrees to accompany him part of the way.
	   Michelangelo's ``Last Judgment'' and Dore's illustrations for
``The Divine Comedy'' were nothing like this particular hell. All
of the computer-generated visual effects developed in recent years
combine to create a phantasmagoria of flame, desolation and human
suffering. It is a rare accomplishment by production designer
Eugenio Zanetti and the effects wizards.
	   Albert transfers his guide duties to another mystery figure, The
Tracker (Max Von Sydow), who leads Chris into the hellish depths. A
number of surprises follow, some not too convincing.
	   New Zealander Vincent Ward directed the film with more of an eye
for the visuals than a credible story. The script was written by
Ron Bass from a novel by Richard Matheson, and it is filled with
cryptic lines such as, ``The real hell is your life gone wrong,''
and, ``Sometimes when you win, you lose.''
	   The Polygram release was produced by Stephen Simon and Barnet
Bain. Running time: 113 minutes.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Inside the posh cabin of a yacht named Just
Dreamin!, the bitter editor of the men's magazine Rogue gazes over
a bevy of bikini-clad beauties she has kidnapped and sneers:
``Those girls were all playmates, but I was never good enough.''
	   Busty blonde bodyguard Vallery Irons, her hands bound, responds
in disbelief. ``You tried to be a playmate of the month?''
	   ``More times than I care to remember.''
	   ``You're not crazy,'' Irons says, ``you're sick.''
	   ``Cut!'' shouts the director from the stern a few moments later.
``That's very good. I'd like to do one more.''
	   The cabin of the Just Dreamin!, tied to a dock in Los Angeles
Harbor, has been commissioned for location work for the new fall
series ``V.I.P.,'' which debuted last weekend in syndication on
more than 200 TV stations.
	   The show is about _ well, that's complicated (more on the
premise later). All you really need to know at this point is that
its star and executive producer is Pamela Anderson Lee, late of
``Baywatch'' and a string of courtroom appearances that include her
husband's spousal abuse case, a breach of contract trial and a
lawsuit over use of sex videos involving her.
	   In a savvy career move, Ms. Anderson Lee, 31, is launching a
show that plays to _ and winks at _ her tumultuous personal life,
with the tabloid insanity and Playboy layout history inspiring the
scripts of the action-comedy, though sometimes it's hard to tell
the show from her life.
	   In ``V.I.P.,'' the star of one America's more famous steamy home
videos (with estranged husband, rocker Tommy Lee, recently out of
jail for kicking her) plays Vallery Irons, a woman who is famous
for being famous, and who finds herself in way over her head.
	   ``This character comes really naturally to me,'' Ms. Anderson
Lee said, during a break between scenes. ``There's a real sense of
humor. People haven't seen that side of me.''
	   Picture ``Remington Steele'' meets ``Charlie's Angels'' with
touches of ``Miami Vice'' and a Playboy home video, a sort of ``The
A-Team'' with cleavage. Station owners all over the world can't
wait to put it on the air.
	   Producers have a 22-episode commitment _ enough for an entire
year _ and are essentially guaranteed a second season as long as
ratings don't fall lower than Ms. Anderson Lee's necklines.
	   The show got started in the offices of William Morris, that
agency that represents Ms. Anderson Lee and screenwriter Jonathan
``J.F.'' Lawton, whose most famous credit is ``Pretty Woman.''
	   Ms. Anderson Lee, a former Playboy model and ``Tool Time'' girl
on ``Home Improvement,'' was looking to get back into television,
Lawton was looking to produce, and ``V.I.P'' was born. Both serve
as executive producers.
	   Originally, it was to be a more serious show. But seeing how
that sort of thing went over in her dud 1996 movie ``Barbed Wire,''
Ms. Anderson Lee suggested a change: Make it lighter and glitzier,
and make her character a fish out of water, a bodyguard who has no
idea what she's doing.
	   Lawton retooled the premise so that Ms. Anderson's character was
now a nobody hot-dog stand worker who gets tossed into the
limelight during a big Hollywood event, then gets hired by a
bodyguard company looking for a ``name'' to give the firm some
celebrity gloss. She's assured she's only a figurehead at Vallery
Irons Protection, but, of course, she ends up in all sorts of
trouble.
	   Just like Ms. Anderson Lee, whose tumultuous relationship with
Lee has been a magnet for paparazzi and tabloids.
	   ``I'd joke with her that I can always find out what happened to
her by turning on the radio,'' said Lawton, who tried, admittedly
with difficulty, to ignore some of the more sensational reports
during filming.
	   ``This tabloid had her ballooning up from eating so many pizzas,
like 10 pizzas in a row, and that we'd have start shooting around
her,'' he said. ``And I'd think, 'I just saw her a couple of days
ago and she was fine.' But I couldn't help but look at her again
and (ask): Is she fatter?''
	   Then, one day, Lawton himself felt the tabloid heat.
	   On July 28, the Globe ran what it called a ``revealing'' picture
of him and Ms. Anderson Lee from a press conference. From the
camera angle, the picture either shows her innocently whispering in
his ear or lovingly nibbling his mustachioed top lip.
	   ``Pam Anderson has found her Mr. Right _ kind and charming
Jonathan Lawton _ the mild-mannered executive producer of her new
TV series 'V.I.P.,'' wrote the Globe, in a story that goes on to
say that while Lawton may be Ms. Anderson Lee's model man, she's
not about to wreck his happy marriage.
	   ``Suddenly, people are calling me up about this,'' Lawton
recalled, laughing. ``I take it to my wife, and say, 'Now, don't
get angry.'''
	   In the end, he and his wife, whom he described as very
understanding and very trusting, were able to laugh it off.
	   ``It's tough being Pam,'' said Lawton. ``That one moment just
made me realize what it's like to deal with it every week.''
	   Still, these experiences have provided more than enough fodder
for the TV show:
	   ``Don't you think it's a little crazy?'' Vallery Irons says to
her kidnapper.
	   ``What's crazy is how some women are worshipped for their
appearance,'' the kidnaper says.
	   ``You're telling me,'' replies Ms. Anderson Lee. ``It's such a
drag at times.''

Curtain rises at the New York Film Festival

 &UR; Eds: Festival ends Oct. 11 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Woody Allen's ``Celebrity'' opened this year's
New York Film Festival.
	   The writer-director doesn't star in the film. But he cast a
group of real stars _ Kenneth Branagh, Melanie Griffith, Leonardo
DiCaprio, Winona Ryder and Joe Mantegna.
	   The black-and-white film, set in Manhattan, tells the story of a
struggling free-lance writer, his relationships with women and a
string of encounters with various celebrities.
	   ``I'm very pleased that this year's selection turned out to be
such a potent mix of works by several great cinematic masters _
Eric Rohmer, Alain Resnais, Woody Allen, Shohei Imamura,'' said
Richard Pena, chairman of the New York Film Festival Selection
Committee.
	   Eight films directed by Americans are included this year. Five
are by French filmmakers, including Rohmer and Resnais, whose films
were among those shown during the opening days of the festival,
scheduled from Sept. 25 to Oct. 11.
 &UR; ``Celebrity''
	   ``Celebrity'' is Allen's 27th film. The movie was shot at
various locations throughout New York by famed cinematographer Sven
Nykvist. During the filming, most of the stars were given only the
pages of the script that pertained to his or her character.
	   In one scene, DiCaprio, who plays an arrogant, drug-snorting
movie star, trashes a hotel room and slaps around his hysterical
girlfriend, played by Gretchen Mol. As the police arrive to arrest
DiCaprio's character, Branagh is in the crowd on the hotel's
sidewalk, clutching his screenplay, which he is pitching to
DiCaprio's character.
	   In another scene, book editor Famke Janseen stands on the deck
of a boat, angrily tossing the only copy of Branagh's manuscript _
page by page _ into the river. Branagh watches helplessly from the
dock.
	   Allen didn't attend the press conference held following two
media screenings of his film. But Branagh did. Although
similarities in Branagh's on-screen character and Allen's nervous
tics and twitches were remarkably striking, Branagh said he didn't
intentionally mimic the director's mannerisms.
	   ``I felt I was playing Lee Simon,'' Branagh said.
	   Branagh's character in ``Celebrity'' is divorced from his wife,
played by Judy Davis, and is going through a series of girlfriends.
At the same time, he is trying to ingratiate himself with a number
of famous people, like DiCaprio, who might be useful to him
professionally.
	   ``For me, to be directed by someone like Woody was extremely
illuminating,'' Branagh said. ``My experience was that if he didn't
say much, he liked it, and if he didn't like it, he did say a
lot.''
	   In the production notes, Allen comments on the many sides of
fame and how it impacts on the film's characters: ``There's a
ridiculousness and superficiality to so much of it, and a price to
pay, but the perks are good.''
	   ``Celebrity'' opens in theaters nationwide in November.
 &UR; ``Same Old Song''
	   There's a very good reason why actress Agnes Jaoui was so
familiar with the character she plays in Resnais' ``Same Old
Song.'' She co-wrote the script.
	   The film pays tribute to English writer Dennis Potter. It is the
story of six Parisians who express their secret desires by breaking
into snatches of popular French songs, in a style similar to
Potter's ``Pennies from Heaven.''
	   Although Jaoui didn't know Potter's work _ ``I discovered him
with Alain'' _ she said Resnais is an avid fan. ``He knows him by
heart. ... He knows everything he did.''
	   Most of the extracts of the songs are very short, sometimes cut
in the middle, instead of a whole chorus or a verse.
	   How difficult was it to lip-synch to fragments of French
recordings in the midst of spoken dialogue?
	   ``We rehearsed a lot with the soundman and that's all,'' Jaoui
said. ``We rehearsed to know perfectly the song.''
	   Jaoui plays Camille, a tour guide and student who is being
pursued by two different suitors. (She is writing her thesis on the
yeomen of Paladru Lake in the year 1000.) The scene is complicated
by the arrival of Nicolas, her sister Odile's former boyfriend.
Jean-Pierre Bacri, who plays the ex-boyfriend, was a co-writer on
the script.
	   Bacri and Jaoui have worked together as writers on several other
films, including ``Smoking'' and ``No Smoking,'' also directed by
Resnais, and ``Un Air de Famille.''
 &UR; ``A Tale of Autumn''
	   Rohmer's ``A Tale of Autumn'' explores the romantic yearnings of
middle age. Beatrice Romand plays a feisty 45-year-old winegrower
in the south of France whose best friend makes plans to set her up
with an amiable businessman, even as her son's girlfriend plots to
pair her with a college professor.
	   Marie Riviere plays Romand's friend, Isabelle, who places a
personal ad in the newpaper and then poses as her friend in the
initial meetings with the businessman, played by Alain Libolt. The
businessman and the college professor are introduced to Romand at
the wedding of Isabelle's daughter.
	   Riviere, one of Rohmer's longtime associates (``Perceval le
Gallois,'' ``La Femme de l'Aviateur,'' ``Le Rayon Vert''),
acknowledged the lack of film roles for actresses over the age of
45 in France today. ``After 40, 45 years of age, forget it,'' she
said.
	   ``It is very rare on the screen to see a woman accepting her age
in that way,'' she added.
	   Riviere said Rohmer shot most of the scenes in one or two takes
because he feared that if he did it over and over again, the scene
would no longer be fresh.
	   ``A Tale of Autumn'' is the final installment in Rohmer's
series, ``Tales of the Four Seasons.''

Moscow's kids dance the crisis away

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At the Propaganda dance club, manager Masha
Maslyukova watched calmly as her harried bouncers held back a line
of kids pushing and shoving, demanding entrance through a small
door.
	   It could have been a crowd of depositors frantic to remove their
money from one of the city's failing banks. But the rumbling techno
music within _ not Russia's financial crisis _ was whipping up this
crowd.
	   ``I've got no fear of this club closing,'' Maslyukova said.
``Whatever happens, we will be the last one in Moscow.''
	   Russia's younger generation seems determined to keep partying in
the face of the country's latest crisis. The crowds are still
turning up many of Moscow's popular dance clubs and casinos, though
smaller establishments are seeing a dropoff in attendance.
	   Under communism, Western-style clubs did not exist, or were
secreted away from the government's eye and hard to find. Since
then, discos, casinos and restaurants have sprouted throughout
Moscow and in other cities, creating an energetic night life.
	   ``We come here to unwind,'' 23-year-old Anya Sidnenko shouted
over the sound of blaring music in Propaganda, located in downtown
Moscow about a five minute drive from Red Square, at Bolshoi
Zlatousinsky Pereulok 7.
	   ``Anyway, it's better to go dancing than sit around moaning,''
she said, looking down onto the dance floor packed with college-age
Russians dancing to popular western music hits arranged by a local
DJ.
	   The Propaganda crowd, young Russians dressed in the latest
fashion styles, did not seem affected by the crisis at all. They
piled into booths in the club's steamy, hard-wood main hall, and
sat in booths on two balconies overlooking the dance floor, sipping
cocktails and beer.
	   Some casinos around the city also said they were still doing
reasonably well, though the crisis is less than two months old and
could still get worse.
	   ``In our restaurant there's no one,'' said Lena Danushevskaya,
office manager at the Arbat Casino, which demands a 200 ruble (dlrs
12) cover. ``But we've actually had more clients coming in to the
gambling tables.''
	   A number of clubs are hurting, and the first wave of cutbacks
has already hit. Some club and casino owners said they were
reducing their menus, laying off staff, cutting wages, and
shortening their hours of operation.
	   ``Of course the crisis is hurting us,'' said Janna Volkova,
manager of the A-Club, a dance club visited most often by Russians
in their late twenties. ``Most of our clients are from the middle
class, and they're the ones who are hardest hit.''
	   Prices at the club, which charges a 100 ruble (dlrs 6) cover,
were once well within the range of middle class Russians, but now
are up by 50 percent to counteract the falling ruble and deal with
rising prices on imported alcohol. A more somber feeling was in the
air, Volkova said.
	   ``People are still showing up, they're just drinking more
vodka,'' she said. ``I hope we'll survive, but it's just impossible
to predict what will happen.''
	   Some clubs, like stores around the city, have also begun listing
their prices in dollars to guard against the recent wild swings in
the Russian ruble.
	   As Saturday night gave way to Sunday dawn, a group of club goers
agreed that the popular clubs like Propaganda, with a low cover
charge and a young crowd, would survive in Moscow but their numbers
would shrink as the crisis takes its toll.
	   ``Things are just super right now,'' gushed 20-year-old Klara
Tamnachuk, outside a club where kids gathered around the doorway,
escaping the heat of the crowded dance floor. ``We're relaxed ...
but only while there's money.''

Ohio State's defense leads top-ranked Buckeyes over Penn State
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) _ Linebackers Jerry Rudzinski and Joe Cooper
recovered fumbles in the end zone for touchdowns Saturday as
top-ranked Ohio State beat No. 7 Penn State 28-9.
	   Last year, Penn State gained the No. 1 ranking with a win over
Ohio State at State College, Pa. In the rainy rematch at Columbus,
Ohio, the Buckeyes (4-0, 1-0 Big Ten) backed up their No. 1 ranking
with a dominating defensive performance against the Nittany Lions
(3-1, 0-1).
	   ``We wanted to redeem ourselves from that embarrassment last
year,'' Rudzinski said. ``We had the same players back and wanted
to step up and show the country.''
	   Rudzinski recovered a fumble by Penn State quarterback Kevin
Thompson for a TD with 3:51 left in the first half. In the third
quarter, Percy King blocked a Penn State punt and Cooper recovered
to put Ohio State up 21-3.
	   The Buckeyes' offensive touchdowns came on a 20-yard (18-meter)
TD pass from Joe Germaine to Michael Wiley just before halftime and
Joe Montgomery's 1-yard (meter) run with 3:08 left in the third
quarter.
	   Ohio State quarterbacks coach Tim Salem got so excited by
Wiley's TD that he punched his hand through a window and sent glass
shattering into the press box. He suffered small cuts on his right
index finger and forearm.
	   In other Top 25 games, it was No. 3 Tennessee 17, Auburn 9; No.
4 UCLA 49, Washington State 17; No. 8 Florida 16, Alabama 10; No. 9
Florida State 24, Maryland 10; No. 10 Virginia 52, San Jose State
14; No. 13 Wisconsin 24, Indiana 20; No. 15 Colorado 27, Oklahoma
25; No. 16 West Virginia 45, Navy 24; No. 18 Texas A-and-M 24,
Kansas 21; No. 23 Notre Dame 35, Stanford 17; co-No. 23 Missouri
35, Northwestern State 14; and No. 25 Michigan 12, Iowa 9.
	   In late games, it was No. 2 Nebraska at Oklahoma State; No. 12
Georgia at No. 6 LSU; No. 14 Arizona at No. 20 Washington; Arizona
State at No. 21 Southern California; and Kentucky at No. 22
Arkansas.

Yugoslav air defense is put on high alert at threat of NATO

airstrikes draws near &QL;

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav air defense has been
put on high alert as the threat of NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia to put an end to fighting in Kosovo draws near.
	   In an effort to show they are willing to back down, Serbian
authorities on Saturday installed an interim government in the
rebellious Serbian province. A Western diplomat also said that up
to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, have been
pulled out of Kosovo so far.
	   But the West apparently remained unmoved.
	   Speaking in Copenhagen, Denmark, German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said that the NATO intervention clock ``is at one minute to
12.'' He stressed that ``no ultimatum, no date has been set,'' but
added: ``Mr. Milosevic must know that we are serious.''
	   The Yugoslav government said Friday the fighting had ended and
blamed continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels. Serbia is the
larger of two republics that comprise Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people have died since the Serbs began their efforts
to crack down on separatist resistance in the province, which is
populated largely by ethnic Albanians, and an estimated 275,000
people have been driven from their homes.
	   Zoran Andjelkovic, the man appointed by the Serbian Parliament
to head the 18-member Interim Executive Council, told the new
members at their first session in the Kosovo Parliament building,
``We have to defeat the terrorists and work for the benefit of all
our citizens.''
	   Meanwhile, the Yugoslav air defense has been placed on the
highest state of alert to counter possible NATO airstrikes, said a
Yugoslav army commander who spoke Saturday on condition of
anonymity.
	   The Yugoslav government also has called a special session of the
federal parliament for Monday to discuss how to ``protect the
international position and state interests'' of the country.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders rejected the interim council.
Andjelkovic appointed seven Serbs, five ethnic Albanians and the
rest Turks and Muslims. He said he consulted no political parties.
	   Constituting the council, moribund since 1989, was part of a
last-ditch effort to show that Serbs intend to end the conflict.
U.N. chief Kofi Annan plans report Monday to the Security Council
on whether Belgrade is complying with demands to halt its assault
on ethnic Albanians. If not, Washington has indicated that NATO
airstrikes will follow within two weeks.
	   Momentum for international leaders to step in has increased in
the past week amid revelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian
civilians in the forests of Kosovo.
	   On Saturday, Serb police took reporters to the site of what they
thought was a mass grave on a mountaintop near the village of
Volujak, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) west of the provincial
capital, Pristina. Dogs, they said, had unearthed human bones in an
area formerly held by the KLA.
	   With reporters looking on, police dug up parts of four skeletons
and said from the smell that they suspected there were more, but
there was no way to identify the remains or determine their
ethnicity and cause of death without closer forensic investigation.
	   The Serbian media reported that Chinese-made bullet casings were
found and also empty casings of hunting rifles at the site where
the bodies were found, both characteristic for ammunition used by
the KLA.
	   Also Saturday, the pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center
reported that nine more bodies were found at two different
locations in Kosovo. The center said some of the victims were
ethnic Albanians.
	   Serbs shelled a village in southwestern Kosovo near Malisevo,
the center said.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholic
pilgrims flocked to the centuries-old southern coastal town of
Split to see Pope John Paul II celebrate Sunday Mass on the last
day of his visit to Croatia.
	   The city was draped in the Vatican's traditional yellow and
white in preparation for Sunday's outdoor Mass, and people arrived
from across the country, as well as neighboring Bosnia and
Montenegro, which together with Serbia comprises Yugoslavia.
	   On Saturday evening, the border crossing between Croatia and
Montenegro was opened for the first time after the war, allowing
Croats from Montenegro to attend the Mass.
	   Some 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million population is Catholic,
and the Vatican looks at the country as a Catholic bastion in the
Balkans, amid Orthodox Christians and Muslims.
	   John Paul also was to visit St. Dujam Cathedral and spend time
with the youth in the town, which is celebrating 1,700 years of
existence.
	   But for most Croats, the highlight of the pope's three-day visit
was Saturday's beatification of the controversial World War II
Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac. Roman Catholics hail Stepinac as a
martyr, but many Serbs and Jews accuse him of sympathizing with the
Nazis.
	   The beatification is the last step before possible sainthood.
	   As Zagreb's archbishop, Stepinac supported Croatia's
German-backed fascist puppet state in its early days. By 1942,
however, Stepinac denounced the regime's genocidal policies, which
led to the extermination of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and
Croat opponents.
	   After the war, the cardinal was tried by Yugoslavia's communist
government and sentenced to prison for collaborating with the
Nazis. He died in 1960 while under house arrest, the basis of the
Vatican's finding that he died for his faith.
	   Honoring Stepinac before half a million people in the Marian
shrine of Marija Bistrica on Saturday, the pope said Stepinac,
``having endured in his own body and his own spirit the atrocities
of the communist system, is now entrusted to the memory of his
fellow countrymen with the radiant badge of martyrdom.''
	   He said Stepinac's figure summed up ``the whole tragedy which
befell the Croatian people and Europe in the course of this century
marked by the three great evils of fascism, national socialism and
communism.''
	   John Paul also addressed Croatia's emergence from the 1991 war
with its minority Serbs, appealing to a country ``to forgive and
reconcile and to purify one's memory of hatred'' and ``the desire
for revenge.''
	   When the pope first visited Croatia in 1994, rebel Serbs still
controlled the third of the country, which they seized with the
Yugoslavia's backing. Croatia retook these territories in 1995, but
many Serbs fled the offensive, and the government is reluctant to
see them back.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police arrested a woman Sunday on charges of
attempted murder and fraud for allegedly poisoning a man in a bid
to collect his life insurance money.
	   Masumi Hayashi, a 37-year-old a former insurance saleswoman, was
taken into custody in the western state of Wakayama on suspicion of
serving the man food laced with arsenic in September 1997. The
unidentified man spent nearly five months in a hospital before he
was released in January.
	   Also arrested Sunday was Hayashi's husband, Kenji Hayashi, 53.
on charges of fraud and attempted fraud in a separate insurance
scam.
	   The couple has denied the charges, according to police sources
quoted by national broadcaster NHK.
	   The arrests were connected to an investigation into a mass
poisoning in the city of Wakayama in July, said police spokesman
Hideyuki Shiga.
	   In the incident, four people _ including two children _ died and
60 others became sick after eating curry tainted with arsenic
served at a local festival. Wakayama is located 450 kilometers (280
miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   No arrests have been made in connection with the July incident,
but the Kyodo News agency quoted unidentified police sources as
saying Masumi Hayashi was assigned to monitor the curry pots at the
festival.
	   The outbreak in Wakayama was the first in a rash of poisonings
to hit Japan this year. In August, a man in central Japan died
after drinking a can of tea containing potassium cyanide.
	   The spate of poisonings has struck a chord in a country where
memories of the 1995 subway nerve gas assault that killed 12 in
Tokyo are still fresh.
	   The attacks also have come as the nation is grappling with a
growing crime rate, a jump in juvenile delinquency and general
malaise related to the economy, now in its worst recession since
World War II.

Latvians vote on laws that angered Russia, distressed the West

	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Latvians appeared to have narrowly approved
their parliament's controversial measures to ease citizenship
requirements for the country's hundreds of thousands of stateless
Russians in a referendum.
	   With votes counted from about 84 percent of the country's
precincts, the changes were being approved by a 52-46 margin late
Saturday. The remaining ballots apparently were blank or spoiled.
	   The referendum, which was held in conjunction with voting for
the country's 100-seat Saeima parliament, could end years of delays
for citizenship applicants if early results hold out.
	   If voters agree to retain the more liberal citizenship
amendments, the former Soviet republic will have headed off an
unpleasant confrontation with the West. But whether the results
will mollify Russia, which has denounced Latvia for its treatment
of ethnic Russians, is in doubt.
	   Although the changes remove years of waiting for citizenship
applicants, the laws still require adults to have competence in
Latvian, which many who grew up in all-Russian communities within
Latvia regard as unreasonable.
	   Russians make up 45 percent of the country's 2.5 million
population.
	   The amendments were first passed in June after a tense spring in
which Russia threatened trade sanctions against its diminutive
neighbor.
	   But after the measures passed, a drive to overturn them began,
spearheaded by nationalist politicians who claimed Latvian national
identity was imperiled. Their campaign led to Saturday's
referendum, which asks voters if they want to reject the
amendments.
	   After Latvia became independent of the Soviet Union in 1991,
citizenship was granted to ethnic Latvians and to anyone who had
lived there before the Soviet annexation in 1940.
	   That left out the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians who
poured into Latvia during Soviet rule and their children, even if
born in Latvia. Today, about 452,000 of the country's 740,000
ethnic Russians are without citizenship.
	   Because they can't vote, they regarded Saturday's referendum
with angry resignation.
	   ``I was born in Riga, I live in Riga, but I am Russian and can't
vote. I don't like it here,'' said a young woman who gave her name
only as Alex, selling cassettes in a sprawling market on the
outskirts of downtown.
	   But many people who could vote were annoyed because the
referendum question was phrased confusingly: a ``yes'' vote meant
``no'' to the amendments.
	   ``Frankly, I didn't understand the issue or the ballot,'' said
79-year-old Dzetins Alois, who voted in the parliamentary election
but not in the referendum.
	   Some voting irregularities were reported, including President
Guntis Ulmanis giving a television interview inside a polling
station, and a polling station in the city of Jurmala failing to
stamp about 200 ballots properly.
	   Of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats in the Saeima
(pronounced SIGH-mah), the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party
of Prime Minister Guntars Krasts was the only major party
campaigning against the citizenship amendments.
	   On issues other than citizenship, like the need to seek EU and
NATO membership, there is wide agreement among the parties. There
is also broad support for the free-market reforms that have raised
Latvia up from the stagnant Soviet era.
	   Voter support for one party or another appeared to depend as
much on the personality of leaders as on specific issues.
	   In the early results, the new center-right Peoples Party was at
the top with 26 percent. The conservative Latvia's Way had 23
percent, followed by the Union of Social Democrats, Fatherland and
Freedom and the New Party.

Canada's Reid wins Hawaiian Ironman Triathlon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) _ Canada's Peter Reid has won the
Hawaiian Ironman Triathlon, finishing in 8 hours, 24 minutes, 20
seconds.
	   Reid, 29, who finished fourth the past two years, took the lead
Saturday from Germany's Jurgen Zack about 2 miles (3 kilometers)
into the marathon run, the last of the three segments of the
competition.
	   Belgium's Luc Van Lierde, who set the course record of 8:04:08
in 1996, finished second in 8:31:57. Germany's Lothar Leder was
third in 8:32:57.
	   Reid finished the 2.4-mile (3.9-kilometer) swim in 54th place,
but quickly moved through the field and was third after the
112-mile (180.2-kilometer) cycling segment.
	   The winner of the Australian Ironman last April, Reid moved past
Zack and defending champion Thomas Hellriegel of Germany early in
the marathon. By mile 18 (29 kilometers), Reid built his lead to
nearly 8 minutes.
	   ``The last mile was really tough,'' said Reid, who withdrew from
the race in his first two attempts. ``But then I thought, 'I think
I can do it. I think I can do it.' I did it.''
	   Gusting and shifting winds of up to 40 mph (64 kph) slowed the
bike segment considerably with Zack's winning time of 4:43:32,
nearly 20 minutes slower than the bike course record.
	   Hellriegel, who finished second in the bike segment and was
running in third place in the marathon, began to walk after 11
miles (17.7 kilometers) and fell back several places. Zack also
faltered considerably in the waning miles (kilometers).
	   Natascha Badmann of Switzerland, who finished second in 1996 but
withdrew about halfway through the bike segment last year, held an
estimated 4-minute lead with about 8 miles (13 kilometers) left in
the women's race. Defending champion Heather Fuhr of Canada was not
among the top five.
	   A record field of 1,486 professional and age-group amateurs,
seven more than the previous mark set last year, began the
140.6-mile (226-kilometer) event at 7 a.m. under clear skies and
with strong, beneficial swim currents.

Crew 2, MetroStars 1, shootout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Stern John scored in
regulation and added the winning shootout goal Saturday night as
the Columbus Crew beat New York-New Jersey 2-1 to take the
best-of-3 MLS first-round series 2-0.
	   John, the MLS scoring leader, tied it at 1 in the 22nd minute.
	   In the shootout, he drilled a shot just inside the right post to
give the Crew a 3-1 advantage in the fourth round. Bill Thompson
and Thomas Dooley also scored for the Crew in the shootout.
	   Mike Sorber scored in the fourth round for the MetroStars, and
the Crew's Andy Williams and the MetroStars' Mike Petke missed in
the fifth round.
	   The Crew, 0-5 in shootouts during the regular season, will face
the winner of the D.C. United-Miami series in the Eastern
Conference final.
	   The MetroStars, who also got a shootout goal from Tab Ramos,
were eliminated from the playoffs in the first round for the second
time in three seasons. They did not qualify for postseason play in
1997.
	   The MetroStars took a 1-0 lead on Ramos' free kick in the 13th
minute.
	   Ramos took a quick restart after Eduardo Hurtado was pulled down
just outside the box by Columbus defender Ricardo Iribarren. Ramos'
quick kick caught the Crew by surprise as they tried to set up a
wall, and Ramos was successful in curling the ball just inside the
right post.
	   The Crew equalized nine minutes later _ just moments after John
was knocked down by Alexi Lalas. Down for a minute or two, John
bounced up, went to the middle of the field and dashed into the
penalty area to head in the ensuing free kick from Williams.
