SITE BOOSTS HOUSTON'S NEW NFL TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their favorite NFL team doesn't even start playing until 2002,
but it's not stopping these guys from starting an online tailgate
party.
</P>
<P>
   Ric Sweeney of Addison and a few of his buddies are such avid
Houston football fans that they've launched HoustonProFootball.com.
They've put together a quality resource of information on Houston's
new NFL franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to ride the city's wave of enthusiasm and hopefully,
secure exclusive access to the team that no other site can offer,''
Sweeney said. ``That was a big factor in our starting this so
early. We wanted to be an established and known name when the games
start. And by 2002, we should be.''
</P>
<P>
   HoustonProFootball.com doesn't have a fancy virtual tour of the
franchise's new stadium like the team's official site
(www.NFL2002.com). But HoustonProFootball.com _ launched two weeks
ago and the only known fan site dedicated to the new team _
adequately does the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll help to reawaken any dormant fans that lost
interest in the NFL when Bud Adams and company left town,'' Sweeney
said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been done before. Cleveland Browns fans used the Internet
for the same purpose when they learned the city would regain a
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   HoustonProFootball.com's most popular feature is Post Patterns,
a message board that has attracted nearly 200 posts since the
site's launch. The team's official site, which made its debut in
October, also has a message board.
</P>
<P>
   HoustonProFootball.com also includes news updates and
commentaries by Sweeney's associates, Byron Cox, Stefan Godbold,
Bob Hulsey, Kendall Kirsch, Pat O'Neill and Mike Padilla.
</P>
<P>
   HoustonProFootball.com also takes a shot at Dallas with its
anti-Cowboys section, complete with links to critical commentaries
on the Cowboys. Sweeney said Cowboys owner Jerry Jones' efforts to
market his team in Houston after the Oilers left prompted the
anti-Cowboys sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate a rivalry developing, so we thought we'd stoke
the fires now,'' Sweeney said. ``We have 2 to 21/2 years until we
can cheer on our team. Why not get in some much-needed practice by
cheering for whatever team the Cowboys are playing?''
</P>
<P>
   HoustonProFootball.com will evolve as more details about the
franchise are known, Sweeney said. Plans are to change the site's
domain name and its colors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney also said he is aware that some fan sites have had
trouble with trademark infringements with professional leagues and
their teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a concern,'' he said. ``We hope _ and our efforts should
bear this out _ that both the franchise and the league realize
we're helping to build the fan base and spread the word, and that
supporting such a venture is definitely more beneficial than
squashing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having said that, however, we will do whatever we have to do
to appease the powers that be. It isn't our intention to rattle
cages.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said he was influenced by fan sites for the Houston
Astros (www.astrosconnection.com) and the Houston Rockets
(www.clutchcity.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``Fan sites provide a unique perspective and a terrific outlet
for people to rant and rave _ they're like having a sports talk
radio program in cyberspace,'' he said. ``And if we're half as
successful as those Houston fan sites before us, we'll consider
this a huge success.''
</P>
<P>
   ENHANCED COWBOYS: Cowboys fans who believe they can outsmart New
England Patriots offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese have their
shot Sunday night. The Cowboys-Patriots game on ESPN's Sunday Night
Football will be available on ESPN.com's Enhanced TV.
</P>
<P>
   Enhanced TV lets viewers play a browser-based interactive game
against other viewers during Monday Night Football, ESPN's Sunday
games or postseason games telecast on ABC-TV or ESPN. Viewers gets
points for correctly predicting the ball carrier before every play
from scrimmage and bonus points for correctly answering trivia
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ROSE TAKES A CUT: Pete Rose was in New York on Monday for the
launch of Sportcut.com., which through Jan. 15 will contain a fan
petition calling for Rose's admission to the Hall of Fame. As long
as Rose is banned from baseball for life, he is ineligible for the
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't keep a guy from making a living,'' he said in an
interview with The Associated Press. ``It's not the American way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose's site is also online shot at John Dowd, who was hired by
the baseball commissioner's office to compile a report on Rose's
gambling. Dowd posted the report on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much is (Dowd) making on the Dowd report?'' Rose asked.
``If I died tomorrow, we wouldn't hear about John Dowd again until
the day he died.''
</P>
<P>
   BIG-MEDIA UPDATES: Bill Walton has joined MSNBCSports.com as an
online analyst where he'll also field e-mail questions. ... former
San Francisco 49ers running back Roger Craig has signed on with
Sacramento-based TodaySports.com as a health and fitness columnist.

JUDGE DISMISSES LIBEL SUIT BY FORMER MEDICAL EXAMINER AGAINST THE
TIMES 
</HEADLINE>

(Eds: Elliot - with one `t' - is cq for Gross, and Elliott is cq
for Wilk. ) 
(ms) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A State Supreme Court judge has dismissed a
longstanding libel suit against The New York Times by Dr. Elliot M.
Gross, a former New York City chief medical examiner, who said he
was defamed in a series of articles in 1985 and 1986 that quoted
pathologists and others who accused him of misconduct and producing
inaccurate or misleading autopsy reports.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Elliott Wilk, in a pretrial ruling, did not address
Gross' conduct or competence but held that he had failed to show
that the Times and the reporter who wrote many of the articles,
Philip Shenon, had acted with ``actual malice'' or ``a reckless
disregard for the truth,'' a high standard of proof required of
public officials in defamation cases.
</P>
<P>
   The justice noted that Shenon had interviewed more than 250
people and had ``sought out sources who were friendly with or
neutral toward plaintiff.'' And in four interviews with Shenon
before publication of the articles, the justice said, Gross
``declined to speak about most of the allegations'' and did not
challenge sources he later accused of bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record does not support plaintiff's thesis that Shenon or
any other Times defendant published any of the statements at issue
with knowledge of their falsity or serious doubts as to their
truth,'' Wilk declared in a ruling dated Nov. 18 and made public
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a tortuous, 14-year history of motions, dismissals, a
reinstatement and numerous appeals, the case has never gone to
trial, moving from the state's lowest court to its highest and back
again. And the latest ruling by Wilk, who originally dismissed the
case in 1991 on different ground, did not appear likely to end the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we will appeal _ there is no question,'' Leon Segan,
Gross' lawyer, said Monday. ``We have a good case. We felt we had a
good case from its inception. My client went through all kinds of
torment because of this.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted, as Gross has all along, that the Times articles
were factually biased and based on interviews with sources who were
biased.
</P>
<P>
   Gross, 65, who was dismissed as the city's medical examiner by
Mayor Ed Koch in 1987, later became a pathologist in Indiana and
Ohio, and is now the coroner for Cape May and Cumberland Counties
in New Jersey. He said in a telephone interview that he was
``obviously disappointed'' by Wilk's ruling but declined further
comment.
</P>
<P>
   George Freeman, assistant general counsel for The New York Times
Co., hailed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did Justice Wilk find, as was clear, that there was
no actual malice, but just as importantly he recognized Phil
Shenon's diligent and fair journalism in the reporting of the
articles,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The articles quoted pathologists, colleagues of Gross and others
who accused him of producing inaccurate or misleading forensic
reports that supported the police in several high-profile cases of
people who died in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Gross denied the allegations, and four investigations _ by the
state Board of Regents, the state Board of Professional Medical
Conduct, a mayoral panel and the U.S. attorney in Manhattan _ found
no professional misconduct or criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1986 lawsuit, Gross contended that a series of Times
articles defamed him and were based on false information from
one-sided sources and published with reckless disregard for the
truth. That is the higher standard of proof prominent people in
libel cases must meet, a test which gives the media greater leeway
in reporting on governmental activities; ordinary citizens need
only prove that defamatory statements are false and were
negligently published.
</P>
<P>
   The Times argued that the articles reported expressions of
opinion about the conduct of a public official in the performance
of his duty and that as such they were constitutionally protected.
</P>
<P>
   A series of pretrial rulings ensued. In 1991, Wilk agreed with
the Times and dismissed the complaint. Gross appealed and in 1992
the state Appellate Division in Manhattan upheld Wilk. The Court of
Appeals, the state's highest tribunal, reinstated the suit, saying
the articles contained enough statements presented as facts to
warrant further proceedings. The case was then sent back to Wilk,
who after depositions of Times reporters and editors, granted the
most recent Times motion and dismissed it again.

MISSOURI ZOO TRUMPETS BIRTH OF BABY ELEPHANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA AND LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. _ Moola, an 18-year-old Asian elephant, began
her hard labor Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Her birth ``dance'' lasted 36 hours. Her ears would flap as her
tail swished. Her massive body eased itself to her left side, then
her right. Then, after all this moving, she froze in place.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over she repeated these moves, with cameras mounted
around her pen recording every flap, swish, sway and freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Glazier, the senior keeper at Dickerson Park Zoo, kept
telling himself that even if the baby elephant was stillborn, its
birth would be significant. No elephant artificially inseminated
had successfully carried her baby to term.
</P>
<P>
   But with each passing hour, Glazier worried. Thirty-six hours of
hard labor probably meant the baby elephant was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept reminding myself about the birth's importance so I
wouldn't be too disappointed if the baby was dead,'' Glazier
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Moola bent her knees and elbows and bore down. Haji,
weighing 378 pounds with a waist of 61 inches, arrived at 10:45
a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But he was very still.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the first elephant baby conceived by artificial
insemination...snorted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a live calf,'' Glazier gleefully announced to the
entire zoo staff over a hand radio.
</P>
<P>
   Within three hours Haji was nursing.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the proud keepers at the zoo have been trumpeting
news of their big event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been, well, a real zoo around here,'' Glazier said with a
laugh. ``But we are very, very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The birth highlighted the zoo's world-known elephant breeding
program.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the zoo's size makes its research even more remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dickerson Park is a good example of a small zoo that has
committed itself to big ideas,'' said Mike Keele, who runs the
American Zoo and Aquarium Association's species survival plan for
elephants. ``I think they're an example, even to big zoos, of what
can be done if you really want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson Park Zoo picked a tough species with which to make its
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Elephants are notoriously difficult for zoos to handle. Their
reinforced exhibit areas cost money. Their bulk and aggressiveness
are dangerous for keepers. And they're tough to move.
</P>
<P>
   But the work of zoos to breed African and Asian elephants is
vital to preserving the species in North America. Only about 150
Asian elephants remain in accredited zoos, and some researchers
fear that the species could disappear if zoos don't accelerate
their breeding programs.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, it would have been hard to imagine that Dickerson
Park Zoo could pursue anything groundbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo was founded in 1922. By 1975 the city considered closing
it because buildings were falling apart and attendance was
dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Crocker, the zoo's director, recalls one embarrassing
example of the zoo's inability to find good animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, there was a beagle on display,'' recalled
Crocker, a Springfield native. ``A beagle! That was sad.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, the zoo started its Asian elephant program.
A master plan in 1985 suggested using geographic themes to better
present the animals. The zoo gained its national accreditation in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo pursued more ambitious attempts to breed Asian
elephants.
</P>
<P>
   Elephants from circuses and from zoos, including those in St.
Louis and Chicago, were brought to Springfield to breed with the
zoo's bulls. The zoo also successfully bred its own elephants
throughout the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers nationwide worried that breeding wasn't enough.
Because America's zoos house five times more female elephants than
male, elephants often must be transported so breeding can occur.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson Park's researchers began looking for ways to
artificially inseminate elephants. The thinking was that it would
be a lot easier, and cheaper, to transport semen than to transport
the animals themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges were obvious.
</P>
<P>
   First, a female elephant only becomes fertile during three
cycles a year. Each cycle contains only about three days in which
the elephant can conceive. Researchers helped develop blood tests
that could predict the cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dickerson Park tests blood for circuses and other zoos.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was the delicate matter of collecting the semen.
</P>
<P>
   A male elephant, up to 10 feet tall and weighing more than six
tons, can easily kill a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   To protect keepers, a former zoo staffer developed a chute that
would restrain the animal and rotate it 90 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, zoo staffers needed a way to inseminate the female
elephant. The female's reproductive canal is up to 3 feet long, and
surgery often was needed to place the sperm. Springfield
researchers, including Dennis Schmitt, developed a series of tubes
to make insemination safer and easier.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City and Indianapolis zoos are hoping to make history
as well next spring with the birth of the first African elephant
from artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
   Semen from a bull elephant named Dale in Kansas City was
successfully implanted in 1998 in a cow elephant named Kubwa in
Indianapolis. A Kansas City Zoo official said Monday the pregnancy
was proceeding successfully. The calf is due in March.
</P>
<P>
   Although Haji is the talk in elephant circles, the zoo's
elephants also strike a chord in Springfield. The seven Asian
elephants have become the zoo's unofficial mascots, appearing on
letterhead and other merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   But translating community support into money isn't always easy.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson Park Zoo makes do with a budget of about $1.5 million.
The city's share, about $1 million, hasn't changed much in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, progress is being made. Ground was broken Monday for a
new entry building to house the ticket office, gift shop and public
restrooms. Two new buildings were constructed in 1997, and a new
administration and education building went up in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Crocker, the zoo's director, realizes that the breeding research
saps money from other projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city has never been in a position to put a lot of money
into the zoo like the community would like,'' he said. ``And when
you work with elephants, you have to give up resources that might
have gone to something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, we know that elephants are an important
effort. It's important to the elephants, but it's important for us,
too.''

TRADE MINISTERS GATHER FOR RAUCOUS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With deep divisions among themselves and with tens of thousands
of protesters threatening to shut them down, trade ministers from
135 nations Tuesday gather in Seattle for a difficult round of
talks aimed at reducing barriers to international trade.
</P>
<P>
   The third meeting of the five-year-old World Trade Organization
promises to be a free-wheeling global town hall on the virtues and
vices of globalization, as the world's trade ministers try to speed
up trade liberalization and a panoply of protesters try to slow
them down.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the ministers got their first hint of what promises to
be a raucous weeklong debate when a security scare at the
convention center delayed a forum for hours and forced thousands of
delegates and reporters to spend a chilly damp morning standing on
the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Children costumed as endangered species wandered the streets.
</P>
<P>
   A French sheep farmer angry over tariffs on cheese led a march
on a McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban leader Fidel Castro begged off, saying he was worried he
might be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton, who arrives in Seattle Wednesday morning,
is already altering his schedule to acknowledge the unhappiness in
the air. He promised Monday to hold closed-door meetings with
critics Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as soon as the delegates hit town, many were predicting
failure _ often a brinksmanship tactic employed by trade
negotiators but also an indication of the difficulty of reaching
compromise by the close of the meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is demanding to talk about U.S. tactics to protect
politically sensitive industries like steel. The United States
refuses.
</P>
<P>
   The United States insists on talking about European subsidies to
protect agriculture. The Europeans refuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, trying to placate its critics, is
pushing the causes of labor and the environment, but they seem to
have persuaded few other nations to join the cause. And labor and
environmental leaders, apparently smelling fear in the air, began
proclaiming victory even before the talks began, saying that the
disarray is a testament to the power of their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The security scare at the convention center Monday, triggered
when a guard spotted a broken lock, had an ironic effect: the WTO
had to delay the one major event it had scheduled at which critics
could speak directly to trade ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Police swept the building and turned up nothing. The symposium
for non-governmental organizations proceeded, a little late and a
little abbreviated.
</P>
<P>
   But the day offered a preview of what is to come.
</P>
<P>
   The city was thick with politicians and dignitaries, many of
them with an ax to grind. Interest groups tried to defend their
cause _ domestic and foreign sugar producers, for example, held
competing events to debate the merits of how the United States
protects its politically powerful sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is pushing for a new trade round that
would be limited to a few topics with strong domestic appeal, such
as agriculture and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much disagreement that trade officials at the WTO's
headquarters in Geneva were unable even to come up with an agenda
for this week's gathering in Seattle, so the ministers are meeting
without a script. Their goal is by Friday to come up with an agenda
for a global round of trade liberalization talks that would be
launched here and continued over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Unsexy as these topics may be, the so-called Millennium Round
has already engaged the public more than any previous round of
global negotiations. The WTO has become the focal point of a broad
set of global anxieties about the sovereignty of nations and the
power of multinational corporations. The very tenor of this week's
meeting is being dramatically affected by those fears.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart promised a
boring week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who is a student of trade negotiations will find it's
akin to watching paint dry'' Lockhart said. ``It is not the most
exciting thing in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's own schedule is being shaped by the domestic
political tumult that has greeted the WTO. Two of the Democratic
Party's top constituencies, the environmental and labor movements,
are leading the protests against the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is spending Tuesday in California, is to arrive in
Seattle early Wednesday and then spend about 30 hours in town,
talking up the benefits of trade, attempting to mollify critics,
and urging delegates to embrace the needs of workers and the
environment even as they work to lower trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   He is to spend much of his time at the Port of Seattle, touring
a control tower that directs marine traffic and a transit shed
where he will see apples, hay and newsprint readied for export, as
well as a Weyerhaeuser ship handling exports of forest products.
Clinton plans to give a major trade speech to a group of local
farmers, elected officials, and schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning
Clinton is to address WTO ministers, hold private meetings with
environmental and labor leaders, and sign an International Labor
Organization convention against child labor.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO is essentially a committee of its member governments,
operating by consensus as the members try to forge agreements to
eliminate protectionist tariffs. But the movement to free trade
around the world has become increasingly controversial as many
tariffs are removed and countries increasingly challenge the
non-tariff barriers to trade, such as labor laws and environmental
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's symposium for non-governmental organizations was a
first for the WTO, which considers itself an organization of
governments and whose members often resist direct conversations
with non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Those who came to protest WTO policies said they expected little
of substance to emerge from this week's discussions. Generally,
they termed WTO's Non-Governmental Organization Day _ the official
forum for enviornmental, labor and other groups _ a flop. Activists
in forums outside the official WTO pre-meetings sensed they were
winning at least some points in the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I get disoriented when I think we may be about to
win one,'' said Bill Blaikie, a member of the Canadian Parliament,
who cited ``the obvious confusion of the (WTO) leadership about
whether they're going to come out of this with what they thought
they would. ... I think we're on the beginning of a bit of a roll.
I want to be hopeful _ we've lost these things so many times _ but
I want to be hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   Activists are working to head off plans to apply the free trade
rules to investments. They also are working to short-circuit plans
for liberalized trade in timber and other forest products, and
other goods as part of the so-called acellerated tariff
liberalization idea. They also want the WTO to butt out of
discussions over genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is perfectly obvious at the moment that the negotiators are
in deadlock,'' said Ronnie Hall of Friends of the Earth's United
Kingdom office. ``They're not going anywhere. It seems there is a
lot of hostility.''
</P>
<P>
   American business is trying to turn public opinion around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first goal is educating the American public, workers and
some policy makers that overwhelming evidence supports expanded
trade in today's global economy,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, president
of National Assocaition of Manufacturers. ``The integration of
America into the global econmy has mvoed forward so rapidly that
people dont understand it and the benefits associatiend with it.
... They are susceptible to the demagogic arguments that trade is a
race to the bottom ... when there's no evidence for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is making a concerted effort to
placate protesters.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefksy, the main
negotiator for the United States, delivered a forceful speech
Monday promising that the America will stick to its proposal to
expand world trade rules to cover labor rights, although it is the
most controversial issue among WTO members.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the International Confederation of Free Trade
Unions, Barshefsky said, ``It is astonishing to me that so many
other countries feel so threatened by the inclusion of these
issues. We intend absolutely to persist in this, and not just in
Seattle, because these issues are fundamental.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience of union leaders, who included AFL-CIO President
John Sweeney, broke into applause. Sweeney had said before the
meeting that it wasn't clear how strongly the Clinton
Administration supports labor rights abroad. ``We'll see,'' he
said. ``After the agreement with China, I'm not so sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Pascal Lamy,trade commissioner for the European Union, said he
opposed a proposal by labor unions to allow WTO trade sanctions
against countries that violate labor rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctions are not on the agenda,'' he said, proposing instead
a joint committee of the WTO and International Labor Organization
that ``has nothing to do with imposing advanced social standards on
countries that cannot afford them.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting has particular importance for Washington state, the
most trade dependent in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke called on the Clinton administration to hold
firm to policies aimed at opening foreign markets and creating fair
competition in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that other countries are not putting
United states products and commodities at a competitive
disadvantage becaue of the huge subisidies,'' Locke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that puts our companies and employees at a competitive
disadvantage, and this round of the WTO must address these issue.''

   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Malaysia's fledgling reform movement
made few inroads Monday in a parliamentary election that returned
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to power after a campaign that
stressed stability and economic well-being.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the hardest-fought elections in recent years, the
governing National Front won 148 seats, well exceeding its goal of
maintaining a two-thirds majority in the 193-member Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Though a coalition of opposition parties did reduce the National
Front's seats from 162, most of the opposition seats went to a
popular Islamic party rather than to the democratic reform party.
The Islamic party won 27 seats, up from eight in the last
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the National Front is still the party of choice of
the peoples of Malaysia,'' said Mahathir, 73, who has been given a
new five-year mandate after 18 years as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   But in a televised victory speech at 3 a.m. Tuesday, he
acknowledged a setback that dented his standing in the country's
Malay heartland and could cause him trouble within his own
Malay-based party, known as Umno. His backing among the ethnic
Chinese and Indian minorities remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   After a fierce campaign in which each side charged the other
with dirty tricks, the Islamic opposition party, Pas, expanded its
control from one to two northern state assemblies, out of 11 that
were contested nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keadilan has lost, and lost big,'' said William Case, an
expert on Malaysian politics, referring to the new reformist party
that was formed in protest against the jailing last September of
Mahathir's chief political rival, Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   The firing and trial of Anwar, who had been deputy prime
minister, touched off demonstrations and inspired a reform movement
that attempted to emulate the groundswell that toppled Indonesia's
former president, Suharto, in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that can be read into this result is that
not very much has changed after all,'' said Case, who teaches at
Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia. ``It is possible to
paint a picture of real continuity to the years prior to the whole
fallout over Anwar.''
</P>
<P>
   That continuity, he said, placed Malaysia's political cleavage
between the secular Umno and the Islamist Pas. ``And in that fault
line Keadilan _ progressive and democratic _ has slipped right
through the crack,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   But the strength of the Islamic party, Pas, which formed a
temporary and ill-fitting tactical alliance with supporters of
Anwar, posed a new problem for Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
   Pas' repeat victory in the state assembly of Kelantan and the
extension of its control to the state of Terengganu opened the
possibility of a backlash against Mahathir within his own party.
</P>
<P>
   The political action now moves to Umno's party congress next
year. But with Anwar, who had been Mahathir's heir apparent, now
out of politics, the party does not appear for now to have a
credible challenger to his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The current political drama began in mid-1998 when Anwar
appeared to be preparing the ground for a challenge to Mahathir. In
response, Mahathir fired him, then had him put on trial in the most
lurid political drama Malaysia has seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar has since been sentenced to a six-year prison term for
corruption and a second trial has begun on charges of sexual
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   In the opposition's biggest symbolic victory Monday, his wife,
Wan Aziza Wan Ismail, won one of the few seats to be taken by the
party she founded, Keadilan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy yet sad because I wish my husband were
around,'' she said. ``I have called the prison tonight to tell my
husband of our victory but the prison said it was already too late.
First thing tomorrow I will convey the good news to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday morning if he found her victory significant,
Mahathir displayed some of the animosity that has emerged in his
comments about his former protege.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a lot of sympathy when you go around with
your child and cry,'' he said. ``It pulls at the heartstrings of
people. The question is whether she can contribute anything at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Other opposition heavyweights, both in Keadilan and in a vocal
ethnic Chinese opposition party, lost their parliamentary races.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mahathir's animosity has also been directed at the
foreign press, which has at times lionized Anwar. At the victory
celebration, a member of the crowd called out to the prime
minister, ``I want you to tell the foreign press not to write
anything bad about us anymore!''
</P>
<P>
   Still smiling his victory smile, Mahathir took the bait.
``That's freedom of the press,'' he said, ``to write or not to
write or to tell lies.''

WESTERNERS SHRUG AT RUSSIAN OIL COMPANY'S POWER PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A court-ordered sale of an oil company last week that
effectively made most of BP Amoco's half-billion-dollar investment
in Russia worthless has ignited new cries of outrage among foreign
investors. But it is not expected to have grave consequences for
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over the fate of the Chernogorneft oil company has
been widely watched as a barometer of Russia's commitment to
protecting the interests of foreigners in Russian businesses.
Chernogorneft was the most valuable asset of Sidanko, a bankrupt
petroleum conglomerate into which BP Amoco has plowed much of its
Russian investment.
</P>
<P>
   Tyumen Oil Co., a BP Amoco rival in Russia, successfully
persuaded a bankruptcy court last week to auction Chernogorneft,
which Tyumen then promptly bought for a fraction of its real value.
</P>
<P>
   Despite accusations of unfairness, Tyumen Oil will probably
continue to receive foreign loans and, more important, strengthen
its position within the Russian economic firmament, investment
analysts who follow Russia said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Russia itself attracts tiny sums of foreign investment already _
largely because of its history of wronging investors. The
Chernogorneft sale could hardly make the country's already dubious
reputation any worse, and it certainly will not cause an exodus of
the few companies already in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People investing in Russia are already pretty cynical,'' said
Erik Wigertz, oil analyst with Brunswick Warburg, a Moscow
brokerage firm. ``There have been so many blatant violations
already.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Chernogorneft was the latest in a series of setbacks
for BP Amoco's 10 percent investment in Sidanko, which once was
considered a sign of landmark cooperation between Russian and
Western business. Sidanko's owner, the influential banker Vladimir
Potanin, had the close ties to the Kremlin crucial to working here,
and the deal in late 1997 allowed what was then British Petroleum
to get involved in the development of a huge gas field in eastern
Siberia to which Sidanko owns the rights.
</P>
<P>
   But by late 1998 Potanin's influence had waned, and debtors
filed to push Sidanko's production companies into bankruptcy,
including the prize Chernogorneft, which was actually solvent.
Sidanko itself was declared bankrupt by the spring. BP Amoco and
others have alleged that Tyumen Oil used Russian law to drive the
companies into bankruptcy in order to buy them cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Tyumen has denied any wrongdoing, but has acknowledged its
interests in Sidanko properties.
</P>
<P>
   It acquired two Sidanko units this fall, including
Chernogorneft, purchased this past Friday for $175 million. That
business has been valued at about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Now, left with no promising assets in Sidanko, BP Amoco must
choose the least painful of several options. In the short term, BP
Amoco must decide if it will fight the Chernogorneft sale in court
or pull out of the battle entirely and leave it to Sidanko
shareholders backed by Potanin. BP Amoco is even considering
selling its stake in Sidanko, although at a great loss.
</P>
<P>
   Tyumen Oil, by contrast, is no worse off. Russia's fuel and
energy minister said last week, before the sale, that he approved
of Tyumen Oil's purchase of Chernogorneft.
</P>
<P>
   Although oil analysts have predicted a dire future for Tyumen
Oil, the United States' Export-Import Bank has given preliminary
approval to about $500 million in loan guarantees to the company.
And while some banks close to BP Amoco might not lend to Tyumen
Oil, others will pick up the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had $100 million to give to Russian oil, I'd give it to
Tyumen,'' said one Western banker. ``It's a good credit risk, it's
performed well and never defaulted. It has been aggressive in
taking over Sidanko's assets but there's nothing wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's inability and unwillingness to intervene in the
bankruptcies belies its public statements about Russia's desire for
foreign investment. But many veteran foreign investors in Russia
caught on long ago to the nation's deep ambivalence about having
foreigners play a role in the nation's industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone finds a niche, he can do business here, independent
of any reforms,'' said one veteran Moscow businessman. ``But that
does nothing for the overall well-being of Russia. The Russians are
destroying themselves with this kind of behavior.''

WARNER-LAMBERT SUES PFIZER OVER DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Warner-Lambert Co. sued Pfizer Inc. as expected Monday in an
attempt to end the marketing agreement between the two companies to
sell Lipitor, an enormously successful cholesterol-reducing drug.
</P>
<P>
   Lipitor has become the prize in the merger battle involving
Pfizer, Warner-Lambert and the American Home Products Co. Three
weeks ago, Warner-Lambert announced a $70 billion merger with
American Home Products, only to have Pfizer make an $82.4 billion
hostile bid for Warner-Lambert that day.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, executives from Pfizer and Warner-Lambert have
battled. Pfizer immediately filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery
Court to eliminate several roadblocks _ including a $2 billion
breakup fee _ that Warner-Lambert created in its merger agreement
with American Home.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer unexpectedly filed a second suit in Delaware last week
that accused Warner-Lambert of breeching the Lipitor agreement.
Warner-Lambert's counterclaim, filed Monday, accused Pfizer of
breaking the Lipitor agreement and deliberately misstating parts of
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert said in a statement that the company wanted to
end its marketing relationship with Pfizer and ``reclaim all rights
to Lipitor for Warner-Lambert and its shareholders.'' Analysts have
projected Lipitor to have $5 billion in worldwide sales next year.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Warner-Lambert's counterclaim, Pfizer said in a
statement Monday that Warner-Lambert had engaged in ``a series of
desperate measures'' designed to prevent the company's shareholders
from considering Pfizer's higher bid.

EDITORIAL: TRUCK SAFETY IN TRANSITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 30:
</P>
<P>
   Just before adjourning, Congress approved a measure creating a
separate new agency within the transportation department to address
the pressing issue of truck safety. Last year 5,374 people died in
truck accidents, an average of more than 100 per week. The new
agency is needed because the organization long responsible for
policing truck safety, the Federal Highway Administration's Office
of Motor Carriers, is too complacent and too cozy with the trucking
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic safety advocates have been calling for change for some
time. But Congress was goaded into passing the Motor Carrier Safety
Improvement Act of 1999 by two Republicans, Sen. John McCain of
Arizona and Rep. Frank Wolf of Virginia, and by sharp criticism of
the Office of Motor Carriers from the transportation department's
inspector general. Hearings further documented that the agency had
ignored serious safety violations, imposed inadequate fines and
relied on questionable research by the trucking industry and its
allies to justify weak safety regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The new measure requires the transportation department to
institute all the truck safety recommendations set forth in the
inspector general's April 1999 report. In addition it tightens the
rules for obtaining a commercial driver's license, and improves
data collection on safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   Much now depends on how the reorganization gets carried out by
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater. If Slater is truly serious
about safety, he will let the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, which sets the safety standards for new trucks, say
how those standards should apply to vehicles already on the road.
He will also name an administrator for the new agency who is
devoted to public safety and independent of the trucking industry.

EVIDENCE OF METAL FATIGUE, MISSING PARTS CITED IN REPORT ON FATAL
CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The engine of a plane that caught fire and
crashed last year, killing five Kansas City area skydivers and a
pilot, showed evidence of metal fatigue as well as missing or loose
screws, according to a preliminary report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board report does not draw
conclusions as to what caused the crash. A final report is expected
to point to a probable cause or causes.
</P>
<P>
   But the safety board said an examination of the engine revealed
that connecting rods on two of the six cylinders were unattached to
the crankshaft and that one rod had fractures ``typical of an
overstress separation...''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City lawyer Gary C. Robb, who represents the families of
four of the dead skydivers, said the evidence points to a
metallurgical fault on the part of the engine manufacturer,
Teledyne Industries Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is the NTSB confirmed that there was a
progressive failure of the numbers 2 and 6 connecting rods in the
engine,'' Robb said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Cotter, a local attorney for Teledyne, disputed that
conclusion, although he had not yet seen the safety board's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that the problems with this plane and the
engine were maintenance problems, and I think that's probably
pretty well documented factually by the NTSB,'' Cotter said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on air-traffic controller contacts, radar readings and
witness accounts, the aircraft dropped from a top altitude of 5,200
feet above sea level to the ground in about four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during that time a controller at Kansas City
International Airport, who had been in intermittent contact with
the plane, reported hearing, ``What the hell was that?'' One minute
later the pilot, David G. Snyder, reported he was aborting the
skydiving jump.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts from witnesses on the ground indicate the plane, which
took off March 21, 1998, from Independence Memorial Airport,
attempted to land at Grain Valley Airport. The plane was trailing
white and black smoke, spitting flames from the engine cowling and
making a banging sound as it lost altitude and struck the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, 55, of Independence, Mo., was killed along with five
skydiving passengers. They were Marion C. Rudder, 47, of Oskaloosa,
Kan.; John H. Schuman, 47, of Lawrence, Kan.; Kenneth L. Buckley,
50, of Independence; Paul Eric Rueff, 32, of Kansas City, Kan.; and
Julie L. Douglass, 24, of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Douglass was a newcomer to the sport. The others were
experienced skydivers. Autopsy reports indicated three of the
victims died of smoke inhalation, corroborating reports that the
plane was on fire before impact.
</P>
<P>
   Examination of the wreckage found evidence of oil on the left
wing's main strut, the left horizontal stabilizer and on fragments
of the Plexiglas windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings:
</P>
<P>
   - The oil-filler tube was missing from the engine.
</P>
<P>
   - Five of six screws were missing from the cylinder-six valve
cover and the remaining screw was loose.
</P>
<P>
   - The oil sump, or pan, contained debris from connecting rods
and pistons.
</P>
<P>
   Those conditions suggest the engine threw one or two rods, but
Robb contends that was due to defects in the manufacture of the IO
520-D series engine, as well as neglect by service mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   Robb cited a statement in the safety board's report that
fractures found on a connecting rod piece had ``features typical of
fatigue cracking.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits on behalf of all six defendants have been consolidated
in Jackson County Circuit Court for purposes of pretrial discovery.
All name Teledyne, parent company of Teledyne Continental Motors,
as a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the lawsuits also name various mechanical-service
providers and officials of the Greater Kansas City Skydiving Club
as defendants. A message left on the club's answering machine
Monday was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration records cited by the safety
board indicate Snyder had been a certified pilot since 1971 and had
a successful flight review in August 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Cessna U206G was a 1979 model that had been inspected on
Nov. 5, 1997, with 7,280 hours of airtime logged. The craft and
engine were declared airworthy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the safety board, the engine had been overhauled in
March 1991. In May 1994 it was declared not to be airworthy because
of a cracked crankcase.
</P>
<P>
   But less than two weeks later another aircraft company, Jewell
Aircraft Inc. of Holly Springs, Miss., installed a certified
crankcase on the engine and it was returned to service.
</P>
<P>
   Robb contends Jewell should have detected metal fatigue in the
engine using spectrographic analysis. A co-owner of Jewell could
not be reached Monday. Robert Kroenert, a local attorney for
Jewell, also could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   The engine was installed in the Cessna in July 1995, with 774
hours of service logged since its overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance logs from the FAA, but not included in the safety
board's report, show work was done on the engine's cylinders and
rings in February 1998 and that another certified mechanic worked
on the engine's oil pump and declared the craft airworthy one week
before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Sharp, skydiving club president, said days after the
accident that the Cessna had flown without incident many times the
Saturday of the crash. The plane had been allowed to sit after the
engine flooded.
</P>
<P>
   But just before it took off for the last time, Sharp said: ``It
sounded good. It sounded perfect.''

UNIONS FIND THE HOLIDAYS A TIME TO ASK AND RECEIVE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many are the signs of the holidays: the lines at
Macy's, the traffic in midtown, the Christmas tree vendors taking
up stations on the street. And now comes another: the threat of
labor strife.
</P>
<P>
   With the possibility of a walkout looming, the local stagehands'
union settled a contract dispute on Monday with a trade group
representing 18 Manhattan theaters, preventing a disruption of the
holiday season on Broadway, one of the city's main tourism engines.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations, which the union had described in a statement
as ``an effort to avoid a strike that would cripple Broadway during
the holiday,'' showed once again that Christmas is a prime season
for labor brinkmanship in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The strike threat came as musicians and transit workers were
also seizing on the holiday season to press their causes. Labor
experts say the tactic suggests that unions in the city have come
to see the Christmas season, with its influx of tourists and its
emphasis on commerce, as an important time to make their demands
heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a kind of awareness, in a tactical kind of sense,
that all days are not equal, and you want to pick a day when the
cessation of your industry will have the greatest effect,'' said
Joshua B. Freeman, a labor historian at Queens College.
</P>
<P>
   The stagehands were not alone. Over the last few months, the
city's 33,000 transit workers have warned of a holiday walkout if
the city does not meet its wage demands. The strike deadline is
Dec. 15, forcing Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration to make
contingency plans for the possible idling of the city's bus and
subway lines in the run-up to Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   And a second union, Local 802 of the American Federation of
Musicians, which represents the 70-member orchestra at the New York
City Ballet, voted to strike last week when negotiations with the
ballet stalled. The opening night benefit performance of ``The
Nutcracker'' at Lincoln Center had to be canceled, and subsequent
shows have been performed to taped music.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month Local 802 also threatened to walk out on the
Christmas Spectacular at Radio City Music Hall, but the two sides
reached a contract agreement two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Richard W. Hurd, a professor of labor studies at Cornell
University, said the events fit a familiar pattern. Over the last
20 years, as strikes have become less effective labor weapons,
unions have had to become more imaginative in using them.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, striking in New York City during the holiday
season is akin to a cannery union striking during the harvest, or
an auto workers' union striking just as a plant changes to a new
model line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the pattern,'' Hurd said. ``It isn't the holiday season
that is a pattern as much as timing your strike when it has the
most impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said the labor demands this month bear some resemblance
to the holiday tactics that Michael Quill, the founder of the city
Transport Workers Union, used after World War II. Quill often
threatened that subway strikes would begin after the stroke of
midnight on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years, all through the 50s and 60s, the way the TWU
contract was set up, it expired literally at the end of the year,''
Freeman said. ``So Dec. 31 traditionally was a cliffhanger. People
would be out all over the city, not knowing if they would get
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Freeman said, not every strike is created equal: for
most New Yorkers, a theater strike would be disappointing, while a
transit strike would be truly disruptive.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Attorney General Janet Reno declined to block the
release Monday night of an Egyptian man who had been held for three
and a half years in a New York jail on secret evidence that the FBI
had said linked him to terrorists in the United States and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   With the attorney general not intervening in the case of Nasser
Ahmed, Ahmed was allowed to leave the Metropolitan Correctional
Center in lower Manhattan Monday night, and was met by his wife,
Salwa Al-Byadi, and their three children. In a brief statement,
Ahmed thanked his lawyers for his freedom and lashed out at his
accusers in the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're liars, and they know they are liars,'' Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision came 10 days after the INS commissioner, Doris
Meissner, took the unusual step of citing ``national security
implications'' as a basis for asking Reno to order that Ahmed not
be released on bond while his case was reviewed by the INS.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service, based on classified evidence, had been
seeking to deport Ahmed, who is seeking political asylum. Ahmed,
39, had worked as a legal assistant to Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, the
blind Egyptian cleric convicted of conspiring to blow up the United
Nations and other New York landmarks. Although Ahmed has admitted
to being an admirer of Abdel-Rahman, he has denied any involvement
in terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ahmed's lawyers, David Cole, said Monday night that with
Reno's decision, he is now ``very optimistic'' that Ahmed will be
granted political asylum, which he has been seeking for more than
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the attorney general rejected the immigration
service's argument that he is a threat to national security should
dispose of this case,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno had said she would decide whether to intervene in the case
by 5 p.m. Monday, and with no action by her as the deadline neared,
the INS said that ``upon further review'' it was withdrawing its
request that Ahmed continue to be held.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ahmed's case is not yet over _ he remains free on bond
pending a final ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals on
whether he should be granted asylum _ Reno's decision not to
intervene is likely to be seen as another major blow to the use of
secret evidence by the INS in deportation proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general has the authority to review and overturn
decisions of the immigration courts, which are part of the Justice
Department. Last summer, an immigration judge, after reviewing the
government's classified evidence against Ahmed, concluded that it
was weak, that he was not a threat to national security, and
ordered that he be granted asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The INS then appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which
recently ordered Ahmed released on bond pending its review of his
case. It was that decision to free Ahmed that the INS then appealed
to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, in a case involving a Palestinian immigrant, a
federal district judge in New Jersey ruled, for the first time in
the United States, that it was unconstitutional for the government
to detain an immigrant on the basis of secret evidence. Shortly
thereafter, the INS dropped its efforts to hold Hany Kiareldeen,
who had also been accused of terrorism and had been held for 19
months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Reno nor Meissner would respond to questions through
spokesmen about the case.
</P>
<P>
   But Ahmed's lawyers and others who have sharply criticized the
practice of using secret evidence as a violation of due process,
said they hoped that the decision indicated a rethinking of the
practice at the highest levels of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that he's released,'' said Rep. David Bonior,
D-Mich., who has introduced legislation to ban the use of
classified evidence in deportation proceedings, ``but we still have
about 20 others who are being held, and it's a travesty of justice
that this continues in our country without people having the right
to face their accusers.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of Ahmed was also hailed by Arab-American groups
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Aly Abuzaakouk, executive director of the American Muslim
Council in Washington, said: ``Three and a half years is a long
time to wait. Should we celebrate tonight, or should we decry the
fact that in America, a man was behind bars for so many years on
the basis of secret evidence?''
</P>
<P>
   Abuzaakouk charged that secret evidence was unreliable, unjust
and unconstitutional, and added: ``The only thing that keeps secret
evidence alive is the politics of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed, who was taken into custody in April 1996, had been held
longer than any others who have been detained on classified
evidence. Some, like Ahmed, have been held for long periods in
solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed had sought asylum on the ground that he would be
persecuted and possibly tortured if the INS succeeded in deporting
him to Egypt. As well as being a close friend of Abdel-Rahman, who
has called for the overthrow of the Egyptian government, Ahmed was
accused in the INS proceedings of belonging to an Egyptian
terrorist group, of which Abdel-Rahman is the spiritual leader.
</P>
<P>
   Although parts of the case against Ahmed remain secret, a
recently declassified summary of the evidence shows that the
immigration judge, Donn Livingston, sharply criticized the
government's case, calling it ``double or triple hearsay.''
</P>
<P>
   He also questioned the reliability of some government sources,
and said one was described as ``a friendly foreign intelligence
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he had a ``very real concern'' that the Egyptian
government might be the source of secret evidence against Ahmed,
Livingston cited ``the very real danger that the Egyptian
government'' was seeking to silence Abdel-Rahman, one of its
harshest critics, by persecuting Ahmed.

NEW SPIN AT HARPER'S BAZAAR  
 DIOR GETS IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR AT LVMH   
 WHAT TO WEAR WHEN MARRYING A WEDDING-DRESS DESIGNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GINIA BELLAFANTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first issue of Harper's Bazaar bearing the name
of its new editor in chief, Katherine Betts, has arrived on
newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the talk in media circles about the magazine re-evolving
along the lines of the Hollywood-centric ``In Style'' (whose
December issue exceeds Bazaar's by 244 pages), Ms. Betts put a
model on the cover _ well, a model-slash-actress, Carolyn Murphy,
who recently made her film debut in ``Liberty Heights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt strongly that I wanted to make a statement that this is
a fashion magazine,'' Ms. Betts said, adding that she planned to
feature celebrities on approximately half of her covers.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the magazine's full makeover under Ms. Betts will
not be apparent until February, but in the December issue, which a
spokeswoman for the magazine said was two-thirds the work of Ms.
Betts, her hand is clearly visible.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding Ms. Murphy on the cover are many headlines, some
service-oriented and alliterative (``Party Politics: How to Get on
the A-List''), which make for a busy look that Bazaar's former
editor in chief, Elizabeth Tilberis, who died in April, avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a writer and I love to write cover lines,'' Ms. Betts
explained. ``I believe in titles and blurbs and display copy as the
skeleton of the magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Bazaar's fashion photography, now under the stewardship
of a new creative director, Michel Botbol, has a lot more energy
than it had in the recent past, thanks to the use of more
avant-garde young photographers like Alexei Hay, who shot 12 pages
of fashion pictures at a party at the newly hip Playboy mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting fashion in the context of a real party, rather than a
staged one, is part of what Ms. Betts described as a more
journalistic approach to fashion that Bazaar will be taking.
</P>
<P>
   Will the magazine go all the way in the name of journalism and
include fashion criticism that advertisers might find unpleasant?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to come out and say we don't like something,''
Ms. Betts said.
</P>
<P>
   A New Dior Boutique
</P>
<P>
   The new Christian Dior boutique in Midtown will make its debut
next week, which will coincide with the official opening of the
building it sits in, the LVMH Tower at 19 E. 57th St. LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton is the parent company of Dior, Givenchy and
Bliss, among other luxury brands, and a Bliss spa is to open on the
third floor of the building on Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-story LVMH building, which will serve as the company's
corporate headquarters in America, was designed by the
Pritzker-prize winning architect Christian de Portzamparc.
</P>
<P>
   The ground-floor Dior shop, though, was designed by an architect
who sometimes seems the only one that upper-class merchants have
ever heard of: Peter Marino.
</P>
<P>
   The boutique's opening will be celebrated with a dinner for 250
in the tower's 30-foot glass penthouse Saturday night. John
Galliano will play host, and Foxy Brown will perform.
</P>
<P>
   The evening kicks off a marathon week of fashion-related
party-going that should tax even those with the highest levels of
tolerance for being around people just like themselves, many
carrying small shoulder bags that cost more than laptops.
</P>
<P>
   The VH-1 Fashion Awards will take place on Sunday night, and the
Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute gala is just 24
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Wednesday night, LVMH will again celebrate itself with a
benefit for the Municipal Art Society for 600.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd is too big for the LVMH Tower, and so the event will
be held across the street, in the lobby of the IBM Building.
</P>
<P>
   And the Bride Wore ...
</P>
<P>
   Another resident of 57th Street, William Calvert, an evening
wear designer, is about to embark on an equally frenzied holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
   He will be married in Barbados on Jan. 2. Calvert has known his
fiancee, Halla Elias, who has a children's clothing line, for 10
years. They've been engaged for a temperate five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being two egomaniacal designers, the hardest thing was
deciding to spend our lives together,'' Calvert confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Because Calvert has a thriving wedding-dress business, one thing
was clear when the couple did finally set a date: The bride was not
going to go shopping anywhere else. Still, Calvert wanted to be
surprised by what his bride would wear on their wedding day, and
they found a novel way to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Calvert sketched five wedding-dress designs, and Ms. Elias
picked one without Calvert's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant to Calvert is making the dress. The bridegroom will
see it for the first time on Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope it lives up to her,'' he said.

COWBOYS HOPE TO REVERSE DECEMBER FORTUNES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The mood around the Dallas Cowboys' Valley Ranch
training complex these days is not unlike that in most homes across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   With just 25 shopping days left until Christmas, moms and dads
are starting to feel the squeeze of having so much to do and so
little time to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is the same for the Cowboys (6-5), who are facing
their own December blitz, which includes four of their final five
games.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys are to unwrap an NFC East title, they say they
must find immediate answers for their inconsistent play and end the
season on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   The final rush begins Sunday at New England, which is 6-5 after
a 4-1 start.
</P>
<P>
   December ``is the month teams try to make a push, especially
when you are in the position we are in right now,'' Cowboys
quarterback Troy Aikman said. ``This is a critical month.
Historically, teams that have done well and went deep in the
playoffs have had good months in December. And that's what we are
striving for this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman cites last season's December swoon _ two dreadful losses
to the New Orleans Saints and Kansas City Chiefs and two
unimpressive victories against the Philadelphia Eagles and New York
Giants that gave way to a first-round playoff loss to the Arizona
Cardinals in January _ as how not to play out the final month. That
came a year after the Cowboys went O-for-December and ended a 6-10
season with a five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   But Aikman also mentioned 1995, when Cowboys won the Super Bowl
despite a mediocre 2-2 December.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of those years seem relevant now because of the team's
up-and-down play in 1999. Aikman said the Cowboys are likely to
make the postseason only by overtaking the NFC East-leading
Washington Redskins (7-4).
</P>
<P>
   Because the Cowboys would need help from outside themselves for
that to happen, Aikman said a strong finish is vital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we didn't take care of some other games, we've given
ourselves little margin for error going into the five games ,'' he
said. ``Every game is extremely important to try to win the
division. That's one good thing about us. If we make the playoffs,
we are going to be hitting our stride. If not, we won't be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cowboys coach Chan Gailey: ``We understand exactly where we
are. The team understands what has to be done from here on out. We
have five games left and everybody knows what's at stake in each
one of those games. We have to learn from the past. We get our
chance this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' optimism is based primarily on the increasingly
dominant play of their 10th-ranked defense, which is coming off a
20-0 shutout of the Miami Dolphins. But nobody is making bold
predictions because nobody has answers for the problems that have
marked the Cowboys' season _ namely poor play on the road,
especially in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   All of the Cowboys' losses have come on the road. All have come
after the Cowboys have held halftime leads. The Cowboys have been
outscored 81-16 in the second half of those games and have been
shut out in eight of the 10 quarters after intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey refuses to look at the Cowboys' problems as simply a
matter of problems playing on the road. He said another issue is
the team's inability to finish off opponents with strong play in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the Cowboys have been searching feverishly for
little things that might make a difference, but have yet come up
with answers.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman has no answers either, but he said the bottom line is
that the Cowboys must somehow find a way to correct their road
woes, considering that two of their final five games are on the
road _ New England on Sunday and New Orleans on Dec. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Add the fact that the Cowboys have not had consecutive victories
since their 3-0 start as reason players are dismissing the euphoric
Thanksgiving Day victory against the Dolphins and are pointing to
the New England game for an indication of what they can expect
during the next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be the confidence builder,'' linebacker
Randall Godfrey said. ``If we win on the road (Sunday) that's going
to help us out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys know it won't be easy because the reeling Patriots
will be looking to end a four-game losing streak and keep their
sinking playoff hopes afloat. However, the Cowboys are counting on
their own bunker mentality to help them overcome the Patriots and
start their final Christmas rush to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our back is against the wall,'' Godfrey said. ``We aren't
guaranteed a playoff spot. It makes a difference that we are in a
dog fight for the playoffs. We just got to continue to play well
and stay focused. Everything is still up in the air.'' nn

GAILEY SAYS HE STILL TRUSTS HIS KICKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said he still
has confidence in kicker Richie Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   But his confidence extends only so far.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20-0 victory on Thanksgiving Day, the Cowboys went for it
on fourth down _ and failed _ on two possessions inside the
Dolphins' 40-yard line. Gailey passed on having Cunningham attempt
field goals of 52 and 53 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham has made 10 of 19 field-goal attempts this season,
including 3-of-9 from beyond 39 yards. In his career, Cunningham is
2-for-5 from beyond 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Monday that 40-45 yards is within Cunningham's
range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little bit more wary about putting him out there in some
of those situations (50-53 yards),'' Gailey said. YELLOW FLAGGED
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have the second-most penalties and the most penalty
yards in the NFL. They have drawn 95 penalties for 872 yards.
Cincinnati's 98 penalties leads the league, and the Bengals rank
second to the Cowboys with 782 penalty yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You impress upon our guys the importance of not having them,''
Chan Gailey said. ``The one thing that upsets you the most as a
coach is the presnap penalties, and those have not been drastically
bad. It's been the postsnap penalties that have hurt us the most
this year. All you can tell them is watch your hands, watch what
you do, make good decisions on the field. But you don't want to
take away from their aggressiveness.'' HARPER'S BIZARRE SEASON
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have not seen enough of Alvin Harper to know if he
can help their banged-up receiving corps. Harper, who has not
caught a pass since Sept. 28, 1997, has been active for only two
games and has played in only one since signing on Oct. 14 for the
prorated veteran minimum of $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter of the Cowboys' 38-20 victory against the
Redskins, Harper dropped a pass and drew a 17-yard pass
interference penalty.
</P>
<P>
   He was inactive for the Thanksgiving Day game against the
Dolphins after pulling his left quadricep in practice two days
earlier. Harper is questionable for Sunday's game against New
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just here doing what they want me to do, working and
getting in shape,'' Harper said. ``Hopefully in the next week or
so, I can get in there and get a chance to do something.'' NO WORD
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey said the team is no closer to receiving a definitive
answer from Michael Irvin about his future. Irvin, who caught 10
passes for 167 yards and three touchdowns in four games, remains on
the 53-player roster despite his cervical contusion/genetic
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that that time will come when it needs to come,''
Gailey said. INJURY UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys left guard Larry Allen will miss his third consecutive
game with a sprained medical collateral ligament in his right knee.
Cornerback Kevin Mathis (left hamstring) is doubtful, and Harper,
fullback Ryan Neufeld (right ankle), cornerback Kevin Smith (right
hamstring) and center Mark Stepnoski (left calf) are questionable.
Safety Chris Akins (right groin) and running back Emmitt Smith
(right hand) are probable. nn

FAT-AND-HAPPY STARS ARE STEALING FROM FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Personally, I've got nothing against fat and happy.
</P>
<P>
   In most circumstances, fat and happy signifies a positive state
of mind, as opposed to a waist measurement. It's just another way
of saying life's dice are rolling your way.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, there is a monumental exception to this concept
and it involves our friends in the jock kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   For any coach or any manager there is no more dreaded disease
than fat and happy. It's the same as saying advanced gangrene is
eating away at your team. Fat heads, fat wallets and warm fuzzies
are guaranteed to bring doom to even the best of clubs.
</P>
<P>
   When applied to the local Big Four, certainly heads and wallets
have reached the obese stage for the Dallas Cowboys. But let it
also be said that despite a 6-5 record, it's a team that can't be
condemned for lack of effort. The Cowboys give that.
</P>
<P>
   So certainly do the Dallas Mavericks, even with their limited
positive results in the NBA. And while the Texas Rangers were
playoff-spooked again by the ``Yankee Thing,'' there was nothing
over the long season to suggest they wanted to quit.
</P>
<P>
   But then there's the Dallas Stars, currently our local civic
disgrace and the most glaring example of fat and happy maybe ever
witnessed around here in any sport, any time.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this team stinks. But that's not the point. Worse
yet, the Stars simply don't care.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation from last spring and summer to what's
happening now goes beyond shocking. It's beyond belief.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars team that won the Stanley Cup was all about work
ethic, grit and determination. And that wasn't just in the
championship season. It also applied the season before.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that to the Stars who play the New York Islanders on
Tuesday night. Does heartless, gutless thieves come to mind? Yes,
thieves. They steal the money of those sellout crowds at Reunion
Arena by going through the motions.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse-makers say it's early yet. The National Hockey League
season is only two months old. And what about the injuries? And
what about adjusting to a roster shakedown in such a short
off-season?
</P>
<P>
   But while all of those could have been valid factors, none are.
Not when there's a lack of effort, and a lack of caring.
</P>
<P>
   Newsprint dispatches from Atlanta yesterday morning told of an
``angry'' Derian Hatcher personally addressing his teammates after
the embarrassment of a lazy second period.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness, Hatcher still cares enough to become angry. You
can put coach Ken Hitchcock in the same category, but there's also
a feeling Hitch can't believe what he's seeing. A majority of his
players are listening to Hitchcock, but they aren't hearing. Hitch
can't break through the fat and happy.
</P>
<P>
   And what makes all excuses invalid is that going younger on the
roster has not been responsible for the rotten attitudes. Neither
was the departure of such soldiers as Pat Verbeek, Craig Ludwig and
Dave Reid. It's the stars on the Stars who are losing credibility
and games.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano? Has anyone seen him lately? Since that horrific
crash into the boards in the second game of the season, Modano has
been a ghost. His performance is totally unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull? He looks like a guy trying to buck the system, as in
Hitchcock's defensive system. Those who said Hull would never adapt
to the Stars' style of play may be right after all, one year later.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, give me six or seven Joe Nieuwendyks. You can
have all the Hulls and Modanos you want.
</P>
<P>
   In the category of having awful seasons thus far falls a Sergei
Zubov and a Darryl Sydor, among others. Where their game is at the
moment, it's many miles from where it once was. And that shows both
defensively and on the lack of a power play.
</P>
<P>
   Besides work ethic, the trademark of the Stars had been in
physical play. These people took a toll by constantly hitting the
other people. But it has become a soft team that goes shy when it
comes to contact or anything beyond contact. In the NHL, if you
have no fight, you will be pushed around. The Stars have none.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Anaheim, returning to the Reunion scene last week, was
made to pay for what happened in that second game of the season.
Modano issued a public statement after his neck injury, asking for
peace and goodwill in the NHL. Only his own team was listening.
Peace and goodwill are a proper fit with fat and happy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Western Conference is playing tougher than even
expected, particularly the Pacific Division. The Stars are in last
place in the Pacific for a good reason _ they deserve to be.
</P>
<P>
   The unthinkable is now a possibility. From the Stanley Cup to
not making the playoffs shouldn't be considered unreal. It's
actually the next step after heartless and gutless. nn

STARS HOPE TO START WINNING STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ The one big corner-turning, streak-starting
victory has been easy to get for the Dallas Stars this season.
</P>
<P>
   The second victory, on which single games become streaks and
corners are actually turned, hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Stars won two consecutive games was Oct. 20
against Edmonton and Oct. 22 against New Jersey. Only twice this
season have the Stars strung together multiple victories _ a
three-game winning streak to open this season and that
aforementioned ``streak'' in late October.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, many Stars evoked the ``bigness'' of Sunday's victory
against the Atlanta Thrashers, the first of a four-game road trip.
Exactly how big won't be determined until Tuesday night's game
against the New York Islanders and Wednesday's game against the
Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as big as we make it,'' Stars defenseman Jamie Pushor
said. ``It's going to be how we respond the rest of the trip. We've
had a couple of games before where we thought we'd build on. We
have to come out and build on this victory. This is critical. We're
getting close to Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   A season ago, with 24 games gone and Christmas fast approaching,
the Stars were 15-5-4.
</P>
<P>
   A season later, confined by similar parameters, the Stars
(10-11-3) are looking at a chance to get to .500.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just shows you how the mark has shrunk,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``We have a chance to go to .500, and that's a big
step for us. ... Sometimes that's a hard slap at your ego, a
reminder of where you used to be and where you want to get back
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Where they are is still where a lot of teams wouldn't mind
being.
</P>
<P>
   They're almost .500 and about to get arguably their best player,
Selke Trophy-winner Jere Lehtinen, back after being out six weeks
with a fractured ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The time seems right to make a move, and the players realize
that a single victory, a sloppily played one at that, against a
first-year expansion team doesn't mean anything if they don't build
on it. The table is set: The Islanders and Canadiens are both in
last place in their respective divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, so are the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not meeting with success and you used to be
meeting with it, it's frustrating,'' Hitchcock said. ``Some teams
would be happy to be playing .500 hockey. Our group isn't happy.''
</P>
<P>
   They've talked about solutions, everything from team building to
line changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we're digging down and trying to dig ourselves
out of it ... ,'' Stars center Mike Modano said. ``Guys care.
Everybody wants to win. Everybody really cares about our team and
the way we are heading. I think that's the most important thing. If
no one cared, then we'd have problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, their problems are a power play that isn't powerful, a
1-2 punch that has lacked No. 1 in Modano, who's in a goal-scoring
slump, and, ugh, the elusive team chemistry that Hitchcock has been
searching for all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's there yet at all,'' Hitchcock said. ``It's
an ongoing process that takes time. It doesn't get built
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems have been magnified by injuries (Lehtinen is just
the tip of the iceberg) and losing (it's not easy to go from
Stanley Cup champions to battling for .500).
</P>
<P>
   The solution could be as easy as winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like anything else. It comes with confidence,'' Hitchcock
said. ``We're making strides. Confidence doesn't come in big
swoops. It comes in little steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Or little victories coming one right after the other. nn

STARS' CALL-UPS COULD STAY WHEN INJURED RETURN
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Lost amid the poor second period and the
come-from-behind victory Sunday was Roman Lyashenko's first goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' rookie center scored the first goal of his NHL career
at 7:54 of the third period. And excited doesn't even begin to
describe his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kissed the puck when he came to the bench,'' Stars coach
Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Lyashenko and winger Brenden Morrow have made quite an
impact since being called up because of injuries to key players.
The problem the Stars find themselves facing is what to do when the
injured players start returning to the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said it's going to be hard to send the two players
down, which means somebody else would have to go. A situation that
has a couple of guys looking over their shoulders instead of just
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a big factor right now,'' Hitchcock said.
``There are a number of things that come into play, stuff like
you're not sure what the team is going to be? Veterans aren't sure
who is going to be here and who's not. There is trust factor and
that's what makes a team is trust.'' LEHTINEN STATUS UNKNOWN
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock said he hasn't ruled out injured winger Jere
Lehtinen (ankle) from playing in Tuesday night's game against the
New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't skate Monday because of tendinitis in his ankle but is
listed as day to day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the tendinitis goes away, he'll be ready to roll,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Stars injured winger Grant Marshall (groin) also skated Monday,
but Hitchcock said he's at least a week to 10 days away from being
able to play. CARBONNEAU A STEP AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   Stars center Guy Carbonneau didn't accompany the team on the
trip from Atlanta to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said he had planned on giving Carbonneau Tuesday off
anyway. So Carbonneau flew to Montreal, where the team plays
Wednesday. Carbonneau has family there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than drag him around and not play on the Island, we
figured we'd send him up there so he'd be fresh and rested,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   With Carbonneau out of the lineup, Hitchcock said he'd have
Brian Skrudland center the fourth line with Blake Sloan and either
Juha Lind or Jamie Wright. The third line will be Roman Lyashenko,
Mike Keane and Chris Murray.

MAVERICKS CATCH NAP IN LOSS TO KNICKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the city that never sleeps, somebody apparently
forgot to wake up the Mavericks and tell them they had a game
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Asleep at the wheel, the Mavericks were in Monday night's game
for only a New York minute.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Knicks led by 11 points after the first period, by
25 at the half and by 32 entering the fourth quarter before
embarrassing the restless Mavericks, 107-82, in front of a sellout
crowd of 19,763 at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got a good old-fashioned whipping,'' said center Shawn
Bradley, who finished with 15 points. ``It was like your dad took
you behind the barn and taught you a thing or two, and New York did
that tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no explaining it. They just beat us up, played better
than us and scored a heckuva lot more points than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Mavericks' offense and defense was malfunctioning, they
added another player to their ever-growing list of the walking
wounded. Guard Erick Strickland left the game in the first half
after a collision with Knicks guard Charlie Ward, and X-rays
revealed that he has a second degree sprain of his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland will fly back to Dallas today to have his shoulder
examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it happened,'' Strickland said. ``I just know
it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, point guard Steve Nash started the game and was
scoreless with four turnovers in 17 minutes. Nash said he could
have returned in the second half _ his tender right ankle was
bothering him _ but he said Mavericks coach/general manager Don
Nelson wanted to rest him for Tuesday's 6:30 game in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't feel good, and it's pretty infected,'' Nash said.
``But I could have kept going.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's game was the first of a five-game road trip for
the Mavericks, who are 5-10 after dropping their sixth game in
their past seven outings.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Mavericks' worst loss of the season, as they caved
in early and often and never put up much of a fight against a
Knicks team that received a career-high 25 points from Ward, who
hit seven 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mavericks forward Kurt Thomas helped do in his
ex-teammates. Thomas did not play in the fourth quarter, but
finished with a season-high 20 points ( 10 of 14 field goals) and
six rebounds in 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a Dallas native and former TCU star, entered the game
averaging only 8.5 points. However, he was rejuvenated by seeing
the NBA jersey he used to wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teammates really made it easy for me tonight,'' Thomas
said. ``I was just fortunate enough to get some shots to go down
for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to play well in front of my friends and family
back home in Dallas who don't really get to see me that much. It's
nothing personal between Kurt Thomas and the Dallas Mavericks. Kurt
just wanted to go out and show the fans in Dallas-Fort Worth that
he can still play this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Three consecutive baskets by Latrell Sprewell (15 points, eight
assists) increased the Knicks' lead to 97-62 early in the fourth
period. Not even another 20-point night from Michael Finley could
keep the Mavericks from the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what can I tell you but we were awful,'' Nelson said.
``I think their defense had a lot to do with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the worst game that we have played. As some of you
know we are devastated with injuries, and we have a lot more now to
deal with. It's not a pretty picture at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Cedric Ceballos, who was only 3-of-20 from the floor and
scored 10 points, said now it's gut-check time for the lowly
Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could wake us up for the rest of the road trip, or it
could put us down under,'' Ceballos said. ``Hopefully this is the
opportunity for us to wake up and see what's going on.'' nn

NEW SOCIAL SECURITY RULES TO PENALIZE EARLY RERIREMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN AND CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- For everyone born in 1938 or later, the new
millennium is about to get longer.
</P>
<P>
   That's because new rules taking effect on Jan. 1 will force
workers to labor longer to get full Social Security benefits or
accept smaller payouts for retiring early.
</P>
<P>
   And while the new regulations have been publicized in the 16
years since then-President Reagan signed them into law, few
Americans realize that the rules are about to change, and even
fewer know how they will be affected, according to public surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem, definitely a problem,'' Dennis DeYoung, a
certified financial planner with Brookstreet Securities Corp. in
Tarzana, said Monday. ``I don't think people understand the
difference between today's dollar and future values.''
</P>
<P>
   The new bottom line: For those born in 1938 or later, the age at
which people become eligible for full Social Security retirement
benefits increases as the years pass by. And those who opt to start
collecting benefits at age 62 will get less than those who did so
before them.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Verderano, for one, isn't taking anything for granted when
it comes to his retirement, least of all Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to work as long as I can because it's different
nowadays. The environment is different,'' said Verderano, chief
executive officer of Matadors Federal Credit Union in Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   The changes initially affect people born in 1938 because they
will turn 62 in 2000 and become eligible for Social Security's
early retirement option plan.
</P>
<P>
   If a worker chooses to retire on his 62nd birthday in the next
calendar year, his early retirement benefit will be approximately 1
percent less each month than someone who retired on his 62nd
birthday in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And that same worker will have to toil until two months after
his 65th birthday to be eligible for full benefits. Those born
before 1938 become eligible for full benefits on their 65th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of additional months that people must work to receive
full benefits will increase geometrically. Those born in 1960 or
later will have to work until they are 67 for full benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, there will be an increasing penalty for taking the
early retirement option at age 62. For example, those born in 1938
will receive 79.16 percent of what their monthly benefits would
have been had they waited until they were a couple of months past
65. Those born in 1960 or later will receive only 70 percent of
full benefits if they start collecting at 62.
</P>
<P>
   Mariana Gitomer, public affairs specialist for the Social
Security Administration in Los Angeles, said the eligibility age
for Medicare is still 65 and will not be affected by the change.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security payouts were changed to help balance the
agency's books and in reaction to the fact that Americans are
retired longer. ``Americans are living longer and healthier lives,
which is very good news,'' Social Security Commissioner Kenneth S.
Apfel said. ``But the system needed to create greater incentives to
work longer in order to continue to function.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite years of publicity, a recent poll of Americans 26 and
older found that nearly 60 percent think they will be eligible for
Social Security benefits before they actually will be. The poll was
conducted by the Employee Benefit Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the changes, financial planners and government
officials alike advise that Social Security shouldn't be a person's
only retirement income. They say workers need to take advantage of
Individual Retirement Accounts and the 401(k) plans their employers
offer to save and invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are depending on Social Security as your retirement,
you're going to be in for a shocker,'' said Tex Matthews, Van Nuys
district manager for the Social Security Administration. ``Social
Security is designed to be a supplement to your retirement plan.''
</P>
<P>
   DeYoung advises his clients to figure that Social Security will
pay one week's worth of expenses every month and to prepare for a
long retirement. ``It's very possible that they're going to be
retired for more years than they were working,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews said those worried about their benefits should look for
new Social Security statements that his agency recently started
mailing to workers across the country. The forms will show a
person's complete earnings history along with estimates of benefits
for early retirement, full retirement and for retirement at age 70,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new forms are the best tool for them to know what their
retirement situation is,'' Gitomer said.

COUNTY TO VOTE ON PROPOSED SETTLEMENT FOR TWIN'S ARREST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TROY ANDERSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Friends of fraternal twins Ray and Jay Nugent say
their lives are a story of good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Arkansas, Ray and Jay Nugent looked so much alike
that they liked to switch identities as practical jokes on friends
and others.
</P>
<P>
   But as adults, Ray wasn't laughing when Los Angeles County
deputies mistook the former Eagle Rock resident for his brother Jay
_ a federal fugitive wanted on bank robbery charges.
</P>
<P>
   Ray ended up spending 13 days in jail for a crime he didn't
commit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unfortunate mistake,'' said principal Deputy County
Counsel Roger Granbo.
</P>
<P>
   County supervisors are expected to vote today on an offer to pay
Ray $150,000 for his time behind bars in exchange for dropping Los
Angeles from a $13 million federal lawsuit _ a million for every
day he was kept in jail with violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very unusual case in which the FBI was looking for
this guy, and we had his twin brother in custody,'' Granbo said.
``Once the Sheriff's Department confirmed he was not the person
wanted in the warrant, it took them four days to release him, and
that's why we settled the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray has agreed to take the county's proposed offer, although he
originally sought $385,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to use the money to publish a book I wrote and buy
my mother a house,'' said 43-year-old Ray, who now lives in his
hometown of Alexander, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really got upset with my brother,'' Ray said.
``Anybody can see that we don't look alike. What really got me
upset was that they made me a criminal because of what my twin
brother did. They said, if I have a twin brother who did that, I
must be like him too. It's that mentality that disturbs me.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted he doesn't know the whereabouts of Jay, although
authorities said the trail led them in 1991 to the wilderness of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found his belongings below an avalanche,'' Ray said. ``I
don't think he's dead, but it's information my family would like to
know. The FBI said they have no reason to believe he's dead because
he's a survivalist.''
</P>
<P>
   If the past is any measure, Ray will have more run-ins with the
law, at least until Jay is found.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, South Pasadena police checked Ray's driver's license
after a minor traffic accident and discovered his brother's
warrant. They held him five hours before releasing him with an
apology and a card with an FBI contact number so any law
enforcement officer who pulled him over could verify Ray was not
wanted on the warrants. Ray laminated the card and put it in his
wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's troubles can be traced to June 17, 1985, when police said
a bank robber stole $7,000 from the St. Landry Bank and Trust Co.
in Opelousas, La.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real gunbattle,'' Opelousas Police Chief Larry
Caillier said. ``It was one of the biggest bank robbery operations
in this city in a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   After a car chase, the robber disappeared into the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Police issued a warrant for the arrest of Jay Nugent for armed
robbery and two counts of attempted murder of police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, Ray, a general contractor, was working in
Malibu on June 9, 1993, when he pulled his van off the road to walk
on the beach. When he returned, Malibu sheriff's deputies noticed
he was illegally parked.
</P>
<P>
   When deputies ran Ray's identification on the computer in their
patrol car, they found the warrants for Jay, Granbo said. The birth
date and birthplace were the same, and the physical description
matched.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies asked Ray if he had ever been to Louisiana, and he said
yes. The deputies believed Ray was the person named in the warrants
and arrested him.
</P>
<P>
   Ray showed them his card and told them the warrants were for his
twin brother.
</P>
<P>
   Opelousas police sent a teletype the next morning requesting a
hold be placed on Ray pending an investigation into his identity,
Granbo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten calls on him from all over the United States,''
Caillier said. ``You're dealing with twins. When you stop him, you
have no way of knowing if you have him or the bank robber.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sheriff's Department asked Opelousas police to send a photo
of Jay and a certified copy of his fingerprints. Meanwhile, family
and friends of Ray attested to his identity, and an Arkansas
congressman and another of Ray's brothers, a Little Rock police
officer, called to seek his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``His brother is his twin brother, so naturally it sounded
crazy, like the good twin, evil twin,'' said Roberta Ikema, an
attorney for Los Angeles-based Public Interest Investigations, who
helped free Ray.
</P>
<P>
   On June 18 _ nine days after Ray was picked up _ the Opelousas
police acknowledged the wrong person was in custody, but it took
four more days before Ray was released, Granbo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think the process was real slow, and it should have
been faster,'' Granbo said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's attorney, Meir Westreich, contends that the Opelousas
police and sheriffs purposely delayed sending the information as
part of a conspiracy to force Ray to give up the whereabouts of
Jay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is he doesn't know where his brother is, and it's
possible his brother is dead,'' said Westreich, of Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the case of mistaken identity, the Sheriff's
Department has instituted changes to prevent similar situations in
the future, including enhanced policies relating to warrant arrests
and close monitoring of court ordered releases of inmates to ensure
they are released in a timely manner. When an inmate is
``over-detained,'' a sheriff's supervisor must conduct an inquiry
to identify the reason and corrective action taken.
</P>
<P>
   Ray is continuing to pursue his federal lawsuit against the
Opelousas police because the department has refused to implement
changes that would prevent future cases of mistaken identity.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court trial is scheduled in Los Angeles for Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Caillier called Westreich's allegations outlandish and ``a
crock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This lawyer is trying to milk the cow dry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was a decision not to release him,''
Granbo said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ray, his false arrest has made him more philosophical
about freedom. A general contractor and long-haul trucker whom
friends describe as an eccentric science enthusiast and bookworm,
Ray moved into the woods after his incarceration and wrote a book
on the uses of light for new energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this happened, it changed my whole outlook on life. I
went to the national forest and became a mountain man, living off
the land,'' he said. ``It sort of woke me up. My brother may be up
in the mountains living a mountain man life too.''

HOLLYWOOD TO HITCH A RIDE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD -- A fast-track effort for cityhood for the nation's
entertainment capital could piggy-back on the San Fernando
Valley-Harbor area secession study, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of a movement to split Hollywood from Los Angeles plan
to launch a drive to get 15,000 signatures by June to trigger a
formal study by the Local Agency Formation Commission, the county
agency that will start similar studies for the Valley and San
Pedro-Wilmington area in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood VOTE's timing is critical if it wants to keep pace and
possibly get all three cityhood measures on the ballot in 2002 _ a
move that would enhance chances for the secession movements to win
the necessary local majority as well as citywide majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they start the petition process in January and they in fact
do it within six months, I think they could probably still make
it,'' said Larry Calemine, LAFCO executive officer. ``If they're
looking to piggyback on this thing, I would suggest they move at an
accelerated pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Voters Organized Toward Empowerment leaders this week
are beginning to meet with homeowners groups and neighborhood
activists in both Hollywood and neighboring communities to gauge
support and determine boundaries for the proposed city.
</P>
<P>
   They hope to capitalize on the civic pride and desire for better
schools and streets that led the community to incorporate as a city
a century ago. Hollywood was annexed by Los Angeles in 1911 because
the larger city controlled the water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan and City Council members representing
Hollywood strongly oppose the new cityhood effort but supporters
remain confident of obtaining the estimated 15,000 signatures from
registered voters needed to qualify for the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right window of opportunity. We didn't want to miss
the boat,'' said Fares Wehbe, a Hollywood VOTE board member.
``People think we're our own city. So why not do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood VOTE expects to begin circulating petitions in
mid-January and will rely on both volunteers and paid signature
gatherers, leaders said. Under state law, the group has six months
to gather signatures from 25percent of registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   Both opponents and supporters of cityhood cite Hollywood's
revival, led by commercial development and dropping crime rates, as
reasons why cityhood will either resonate or fall flat with
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg has championed many of the projects
that have helped Hollywood rebound, including the city-subsidized
Trizec-Hahn shopping and entertainment center going up at Hollywood
Boulevard and Highland Avenue and featuring a theater to house the
Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it's (cityhood) going anywhere,'' said Sharon
Delugach, Goldberg's press deputy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood is on the upswing in particular because of what the
city has done. It's no accident. One could say, If it ain't broke,
don't fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some cityhood supporters contend many gains have come
despite City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood is improving steadily and without the yoke of the
city it would take the lid off to really allow Hollywood to come
into full bloom,'' said Jerry Schneiderman, a developer
specializing in office redevelopment. ``We really want to see
Hollywood have the opportunity for some self-determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Wehbe, financial director for the Little Red School House, said
successful Neighborhood Watch groups are an example of community
involvement that could bolster the cityhood movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the many groups,'' he said. ``The galvanizing
issue is to see if we can make it better for the children, for
people to run their businesses. It is our obligation to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Hollywood cityhood proposal is generating a lot of
discussion because it is such a bold bid to take from Los Angeles
the city's very identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a lot of interest in it and that's probably
because of Hollywood's enormous role in L.A.'s image. Hollywood is
the top selling point for L.A.,'' said Leron Gubler, president and
chief executive officer for the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark Hollywood sign, for instance, will be the focal
point for the city's millennium celebration. The sign will be
lighted on New Year's Eve _ for the first time since the 1984
Summer Olympics _ with accompanying laser animation, graphics and
aerial displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you can rest assured that the city won't let Hollywood go
without a fight,'' Gubler said.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber has not taken a position on the issue, but is one of
many expected to eventually decide whether cityhood should be
supported.
</P>
<P>
   Residents, merchants and civic leaders in the Los Angeles
communities next to Hollywood also are watching, including Hancock
Park to the south and Silver Lake to the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it starts to develop we may develop some opinion about
it,'' said Jim Wolf, president of the Hancock Park Homeowners
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock Park residents have shown some interest in a proposal to
form a separate city out of communities on the city's Westside,
though that effort hasn't moved ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said Hancock Park residents want city government to more
closely represents the needs of the city's many communities. ``The
city of Los Angeles is so large a mechanism to identify that there
are varying interests between neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said community leaders support the effort to reform the
city's government charter through neighborhood councils and
regional planning commissions rather than breaking Los Angeles
apart. Wolf said the community just south of Hollywood likely would
want to remain outside the boundaries of the new city if it was
formed.
</P>
<P>
   If both Hollywood and the Valley became cities, the two might
solve several longstanding traffic problems on city streets in the
Cahuenga Pass, said Tony Lucente, president of the Studio City
Residents Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is, Could these cities cooperate to solve
regional traffic issues? There's always an alternative that might
work better, and maybe this is something to consider,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of greater local control is strong with the
burgeoning third cityhood movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly brings credibility to the concept of reorganizing
the city of Los Angeles,'' said Jeff Brain, president of Valley
Voters Organized Toward Empowerment.

RE-SIGNING SELE IS PRIORITY, RANGERS GM SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Texas Rangers general manager Doug Melvin
said he feels like television host Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sitting here asking players, `Who wants to be a
millionaire?' '' Melvin said. ``The only thing is they don't have
to answer any questions.''
</P>
<P>
   They do have to say yes or no, and Melvin would like to see a
starting pitcher say yes this week, preferably right-hander Aaron
Sele. A month has passed this off-season and there has yet to be a
significant free-agent signing in baseball, especially among
starting pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   It was about this time last year that Randy Johnson agreed to a
four-year, $52.4 million contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks, a
move that resulted in the Rangers signing Rafael Palmeiro to a
five-year, $45 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   But the relative quiet on this year's free-agent front
reinforces that it is a weak group with no one star worth pursuing
at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are waiting for one guy to sign,'' Melvin said.
``Then they can say, `If that guy's worth so much money, then my
guy is worth this much money.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have made a four-year offer to Sele. They are also
interested in left-hander Chuck Finley but have yet to make an
offer, which reinforces Melvin's assertion that his first priority
is to re-sign his own free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still want to try and sign a starting pitcher, but we have
to make sure we're not going crazy,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin also continues to talk with Seth Levinson, agent for
third baseman Todd Zeile. The Rangers have made an offer for two
years plus an option for a third year, and Levinson has countered
with a four-year offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should know more by the end of the week,'' Melvin said.
MAYORAL RESIGNS
</P>
<P>
   Rangers Spanish broadcaster Luis Mayoral is resigning after
seven years with the club. Mayoral, who is close to former Rangers
outfielder Juan Gonzalez, is expected to take a similar position
with the Detroit Tigers, the team that acquired Gonzalez last
month. The Rangers are also expected to replace Josue Perez, their
other Spanish broadcaster. But Rangers vice president-public
relations John Blake said the club will continue to broadcast a
number of games in Spanish. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ The Rangers will conduct their annual auction to benefit their
Charity Foundation at 6 p.m. Dec. 9 at the Diamond Club at The
Ballpark in Arlington. Over 200 items will be available. For
information, call (817) 273-5187.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sele has been named the Rangers' Pitcher of the Year by the
local chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   _ Catcher Ivan Rodriguez has been named the Major League Player
of the Year by ``Baseball Digest.'' nn

SPEEDY DEFENSE AT HEART OF TEXAS' RECOVERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Jeff Madden, Texas' assistant athletic director
for strength and conditioning, had yet to meet his new players,
much less oversee his first ``Mad Dog'' session to hone their
bodies. But he knew the challenge that awaited.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he considered it possible to shave one-tenth to
two-tenths of a second off the 40-yard dash times of every football
player on the Texas roster, Madden never blinked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd better,'' he said upon arrival in Austin after the 1997
season. ``That's what I came here to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward two seasons, adding a dash of young talent, and the
result of Madden's handiwork is evident. No. 12 Texas (9-3), a team
mired at 85th in the national defensive statistics when coach Mack
Brown and his staff arrived, will take the nation's seventh-ranked
defense to San Antonio for Saturday's Big 12 championship game
against No. 3 Nebraska (10-1).
</P>
<P>
   Check the respective rosters and you'll find familiar names in
identical spots on depth charts from 1997 and today, especially in
the defensive line. But you won't find identical players, said
defensive tackle Casey Hampton, a 305-pound junior.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton is one of those players who has bettered his 40-yard
dash time under Madden, clocking in these days at 4.8. He's also in
position to become the first defensive lineman to lead Texas in
tackles since 1986. Hampton has a team-high 92 stops, 15 more than
the next-closest Longhorn, and ranks second on the team in tackles
for losses (17).
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the thing that impresses strong safety Lee
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen Casey run down receivers that should have been run
down by linebackers,'' Jackson said. ``It's happened more than once
on those short screen passes. Our whole line really gets to the
ball quick. If a quarterback is the least bit indecisive, they're
on top of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, the numbers back Jackson's claim. The only
player on the team with more tackles behind the line than Hampton
is fellow tackle Shaun Rogers (25). Defensive ends Aaron Humphrey
(15) and Cedric Woodard (12) rank third and fourth, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   All felt frustration as part of a 1997 defensive unit that
struggled to stop thin air. All have benefited from increased speed
_ through prodding from Madden _ and enhanced confidence, as
provided by defensive coordinator Carl Reese's aggressive, blitzing
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to run has changed the mindset around here. That's
the biggest thing coach Brown has done,'' Hampton said. ``Guys can
make a lot more mistakes, but they've got the athletic ability and
speed to make up for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some prime examples occurred Oct. 23, when Texas knocked off
Nebraska, 24-20, in a regular-season matchup. Three times, Nebraska
quarterback Eric Crouch fooled Texas defensive backs with
play-action fakes and connected on deep routes to open receivers.
Each time, a Texas defender closed a 10-yard cushion while the ball
was in the air, saving apparent touchdowns. Although the
completions averaged 40 yards, the drives wound up producing a
combined three points.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line shows a defense that surrendered 33.3 points per
game in 1997 is allowing just 20.5 points per outing this year.
Texas ranks seventh in total defense, allowing 286.5 yards per
game. Two years ago, the Longhorns were 85th, at 399.3 yards per
outing.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Brown said the Texas defense ``has come a million
miles'' in two seasons under Reese, who marks progress in terms of
big plays and turnovers. Texas is making headway there as well. In
24 games with Reese calling the shots on defense, the Longhorns
have forced 53 turnovers, recorded 81 sacks and made 225 tackles
behind the line. In the final 24 games under former coach John
Mackovic, Texas managed 30 turnovers, 32 sacks and 126 tackles for
losses.
</P>
<P>
   To those who have witnessed the turnaround from the inside, such
numbers are staggering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've been here, Texas has always been known for
offense,'' said Woodard, a senior. ``That's all you ever heard. I
always knew we had to play defense, too. But I never imagined it
would be like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The kicker, said Brown, is that this unit remains a work in
progress. Woodard and Humphrey, the defensive ends, are the only
seniors in the starting lineup. Hampton, a first-team All-America
selection by the Football Writers Association of America, said the
Longhorns ``are right there'' in terms of overall athletic skills
with a top defense such as Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who coached against the Seminoles while working at North
Carolina, knows better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still not close to where we want to be in terms of
speed,'' Brown said. ``We've got a long way to go, especially with
our backups. We're in the neighborhood with our starters. But we
can't be a great, dominating defense until we get to where everyone
on the depth chart runs fast. If you're only one-deep, you're an
injury away from being average.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next breath, Brown pointed out that his defense wasn't
even one-deep at some spots as recently as the middle of last
season. Now, they're running in fast company and playing for a Big
12 title. nn

DON'T GIVE MASTER P BAD RAP FOR HOOP DREAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Life was going to be a blank check for Percy Miller.
Basketball was going to deposit him into the material world of
bodyguards and fancy cars, big homes and movie stars.
</P>
<P>
   That was Miller's master plan, anyway, when he was growing up
dirt poor in New Orleans. Basketball took him as far as Texas, to
the University of Houston, before absconding with his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Miller blew out a knee early in his freshman year, his
collegiate career effectively over before it started. You hear
stories all the time of people investing heavily in sports in the
hopes of reaping huge financial dividends, getting wiped out and
never recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was different. All the resources he had been squirreling
away in basketball he transferred to school. He dropped out of
Houston, enrolled at Merritt Junior College in Oakland, close to
his mother's home in Richmond, and attacked business classes with
all the zeal he once did zone defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Education turned out to be a trusty adviser when Miller's
grandfather died and left him a $10,000 inheritance. Miller took
the money and opened his own record shop, which begat his own
record label, ``No Limit.'' A decade later, his decision looks like
a slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, better known as Master P, has made a fortune in the
music industry, more, even, than Michael Jordan has made off
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   From his grandfather's ashes, Miller constructed a hip-hop
empire encompassing music, film, apparel, video and sports
management.
</P>
<P>
   As he did during his days as a point guard, the budding
entrepreneur looked for a weakness in the music industry that he
could exploit. He found it in the vulgar, violent lyrics that had
fallen out of vogue.
</P>
<P>
   They're back again, thanks to Miller. ``Only God Can Judge Me,''
his sixth album, was released last month and stands No. 9 on the
latest R&AMP;B charts.
</P>
<P>
   It has cracked the top-10 despite minimal promotion by the
29-year-old, who has been busy trying to settle his debt with
basketball. Miller figures basketball owes him at least another
chance, and so he spent most of October in Toronto's NBA training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   After being waived by the Raptors, he was drafted by the San
Diego Stingrays for their inaugural International Basketball League
season, which tipped off last week.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is not to be confused with Manhattan socialite Sandy Hill
Pittman, who scheduled an ascent of Mount Everest around charity
balls three years ago, not because she was an avid climber but
because, well, it was there and she had $65,000 to spare.
</P>
<P>
   For Miller, basketball is more than a passing fancy, it is a
compulsion. He plays basketball for the same reason he eats; there
is a basal hunger driving him.
</P>
<P>
   Miller made pick-up games a part of his daily routine long
before he decided to address his craving to play professionally.
Los Angeles Lakers point guard Derek Fisher, who has played with
and against Miller in pick-up games at UCLA, said, ``I don't know
if right now he's ready to be on the NBA level. But he has some
ability. He has an uncanny way of playing the game and handling the
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has an uncanny way of reaching the public and handling
his fame.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's home debut with the Stingrays last Saturday at the
Sports Arena drew 9,762 spectators. It definitely wasn't your
father's basketball crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The people who could name one of Master P's songs in two notes
appeared to outnumber the ones who could identify a two guard.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere you turned there were squealing girls hugging Master
P posters and albums. Three security guards had to wrap themselves
around Miller like scarves to get him on and off the court.
</P>
<P>
   During warmups.
</P>
<P>
   It had to have been weird for Miller to be sitting in his own
crib and hearing songs by Ricky Martin and Britney Spears blare
from the speakers during breaks in the action. One Master P cut did
make it into the night's rotation. Suffice it to say it wasn't ``99
Ways to Die'' or ``Ghetto Dope''.
</P>
<P>
   Family entertainment, after all, has its limitations.
</P>
<P>
   So, for that matter, does the IBL. It is the professional
basketball equivalent of recording a demo tape in your garage. Some
of the players, like Miller, had a shot of espresso in the NBA and
got hooked on the feeling. For others, the NBA is so much foam in
their lattes.
</P>
<P>
   You can count among the latter former Cal State Northridge
player and current Stingray Rico Harris. The 6-foot-9
center/forward played 33 minutes in San Diego's first two games,
both against the Las Vegas Silver Bandits, and shot a combined 3 of
9.
</P>
<P>
   When Harris looks at Miller he doesn't see a music icon but
another guy struggling to realize his hoop dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just like all of us,'' Harris said of Miller, whose
estimated worth ($361 million) clearly sets him apart. ``He loves
playing basketball, he got to the NBA and it didn't work out and
now he's just trying to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Say this for Miller: He isn't cutting any corners.
</P>
<P>
   He works like his playing time depends on it. In the Stingrays'
first two games, his aim was weak (he missed 17 of 23 shots) but
his heart was willing.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4 guard used his long, ribbony arms to wrest eight
rebounds from much taller players. Four of those boards came on the
defensive end, a testament to his tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm just getting the jitters out,'' Miller said. ``I
need more on-the-court experience, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   You get the feeling, listening to comments that sound more whiny
than the synthesizers Miller uses in his music, that a few NBA
players think he should be on the court only to provide halftime
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   After Miller was waived by Toronto, Raptors forward Charles
Oakley, with whom Miller had hung out, said, ``That's life. Who
cares? He's going to continue to make records and we're going to
continue playing basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley's words stung Miller. He now knows what it's like to be
Shaquille O'Neal in the recording studio.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple law of human nature: Crossover career moves will
not be applauded by the truly territorial. Pride gets in the way of
chivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a master of one field and you step onto another
field, you have to know what you're doing,'' O'Neal said, ``because
everybody is on you a little harder.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to be street-wise to see what's going on. ``I
think some people are a little jealous,'' Miller said. ``Of course
they want to see me fail. That doesn't bother me. My whole life
I've been about proving people wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller plays a game he loves because he can, not because he
can't do anything else. He preaches what he practiced, telling
young fans, ``If you don't continue your education you can't be the
best person you want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, you can see why some people see Miller as a menace to the
NBA.

PINCAY EYES HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The tribute, spontaneous and genuine, is repeated
every time a pack of thoroughbreds and jockeys thunders down the
Hollywood Park homestretch with Laffit Pincay in contention.
</P>
<P>
   While his opponents on the track do their honorable best to try
to beat Pincay _ to slow his final surge toward Bill Shoemaker's
record _ idle riders in the jockeys' room gather around
closed-circuit TV pictures and urge him on.
</P>
<P>
   Wielding track programs, hairbrushes or empty palms, they slap
their hips like horseflesh, all those imaginary whips exhorting one
mount, Pincay's mount.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a cheering section,'' Kent Desormeaux said last
week, describing the scene. ``If there are 10 jockeys in the race
and 30 jockeys in the room, then Laffit's carrying the weight of 30
guys with him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is rooting for him,'' said Alex Solis, a fellow
Panamanian who has won 12 local riding titles _ putting him 22
behind his boyhood idol.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime soon _ perhaps before his 53rd birthday, Dec. 29 _
Laffit Pincay (pronounced la-feet pink-eye) will ride the 8,834th
winning race of his career and capture the world record Shoemaker
has held since 1970. As a new racing week begins Wednesday, he
needs nine victories to tie the mark.
</P>
<P>
   In racing circles the achievement will be compared to Pete Rose
passing Ty Cobb, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar passing Wilt Chamberlain,
Wayne Gretzky passing Gordie Howe, Walter Payton passing Jim Brown.
But it will be different.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any other time a sport's ultimate record falls, there is
debate over the new holder's credentials, some small attempt to
discredit his accomplishment, to suggest he had it easier than the
old hero, that he's undeserving of history's crown.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. In Pincay's case it seems to be unanimous: He's
the right man for the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's going to be broken, there's nobody better to do it
than Laffit Pincay,'' said Shoemaker, who rode his last race in
1990 and now, at 68, is confined to a wheelchair after a 1991 auto
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just deserves it,'' said trainer Mike Mitchell, who calls
Pincay ``the greatest rider I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget his feats in the saddle,'' said East Coast-based jockey
Jerry Bailey, who has been competing since 1974 and has been the
nation's top big-race rider in the '90s _ and is some 4,000 winners
short of Pincay's career total. ``His dedication is just
unparalleled.''
</P>
<P>
   Dedication is the quality most often connected to Pincay and is
the reason he is so admired. He's an old-school gamer who has been
known to accept a mount on a 70-1 shot in the last race on a Friday
night, long after the other Hall of Famers have gone home.
</P>
<P>
   If dedication has a vaguely dull connotation, in fact the 35
years since Pincay rode his first winner in Panama have been
anything but that, whether he liked it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay fans inside and outside the local jockeys' rooms can
recite the obstacles he has ridden through, notably the suicide of
his first wife and a career-long battle with weight.
</P>
<P>
   They can also recite his accomplishments: five national Eclipse
Awards, more than any other jockey, trainer or owner; seven
national earnings titles; career-wins records at Hollywood Park,
Santa Anita and Del Mar; a record seven-win day at Santa Anita in
1987; seven Breeders' Cup victories; and the Kentucky Derby and
Belmont Stakes victories aboard Swale in 1984, that Belmont win
being the last of Pincay's three in a row.
</P>
<P>
   When Pincay was inducted into racing's Hall of Fame in Saratoga
Springs, N.Y., at age 28, he had come a long way fast since
beginning his racetrack life at 15 mucking stalls in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Barely two years after his first winner, May 19, 1964 in Panama,
he was hired by horse breeder and owner Fred Hooper to ride in
Chicago. Pincay won with his first mount, July 1, 1966, and four of
his first six at Arlington Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a made rider, a very good rider,'' Cotton Tinsley, who
trained Pincay's first U.S. winner, said at his Santa Anita barn
last week. ``He didn't speak too much English, but he was a quick
learner.''
</P>
<P>
   Panamanians Pincay, Braulio Baeza, Manny Ycaza, Jacinto Vasquez
and Jorge Velasquez opened the door for younger Latin American
riding stars like Solis.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they broke in, people didn't judge you by your accent
(but) by how you rode,'' Solis said.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay first encountered Shoemaker when the latter rode in an
Arlington stakes race in 1966. Pincay was struck by how small
Shoemaker was. Shoemaker was immediately struck by Pincay's
physique and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not difficult to tell somebody who has class. It's like
looking at a horse. A lot of it (riding ability) you're born
with,'' said Shoemaker, who took the career-wins record from Johnny
Longden with No.6,033 in 1970. ``Of course, he still had to perfect
his timing and learn what individual horses need.''
</P>
<P>
   After leading the jockey standings at Arlington, Pincay moved up
to the Southern California tracks that have been his office for
three decades, and beat out Shoemaker and others to win the 1968
Hollywood Park title. Shoemaker had won 15 in a row. Pincay would
win nine of the next 12.
</P>
<P>
   Fans came to recognize the difference in their styles _
Shoemaker's quiet finesse, Pincay's sheer power. Even now, Pincay,
the oldest rider at any major U.S. track, dazzles his rivals with
the seeming ability to ``carry'' an exhausted horse to a desperate
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you're going by, and his horse keeps going,''
Desormeaux said. ``That's profound.''
</P>
<P>
   By his own reckoning, Pincay had his greatest season in 1979,
when his victories included a historic Jockey Club Gold Cup aboard
Affirmed _ holding off repeated challenges by Shoemaker and
Spectacular Bid.
</P>
<P>
   That he's still competing at the sport's highest level 20 years
later is a testament to a body that, local trainer Bill Spawr said,
``doesn't know his age,'' and a heart that doesn't know the meaning
of quit.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker, 4-foot-11 and 95 pounds in his riding days, never
faced the weight problems his pursuer has. Pincay's struggle to
keep his muscular, 5-foot-1 frame at 113 pounds is so celebrated
that he said he plans to capitalize by writing a diet book when he
retires (whenever that will be).
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the struggle led Pincay to pills, induced vomiting and
other dangerous shortcuts that left him physically and emotionally
frazzled. A constant wooziness on horseback and frequent fistfights
with other jockeys were hints he was hypoglycemic.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, Pincay has tinkered with diets, and only two years
ago he hit upon a high-fiber, 850-calories-a-day menu that works.
Six mornings a week in the gym maintains what sports surgeon Robert
Kerlan used to call ``the best physique I've ever seen on an
athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can ride eight horses (in an afternoon) and feel good after
the races,'' Pincay said at Hollywood Park recently. ``Of course, I
wouldn't want to do that every day ...''
</P>
<P>
   There was a point when some wondered if Pincay would ever do it
with his old intensity again. That was the period in 1985 after his
first wife, Linda, mother of two of his three children, shot
herself to death in their Los Feliz home. Linda had battled pain
and depression for about a year after suffering a ruptured
appendix.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter of a horse owner, Linda had been described by racing
writer Gordon Jones as ``like a celebrity politician's wife,
fiercely loyal, totally involved.'' After her death, Pincay was
quoted saying at the time, ``I felt like a hole opened up and
swallowed me. I didn't care whether I rode or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks later he rode and won again, and later in 1985 he
took over the career-earnings lead from Shoemaker with more than
$100 million in purses.
</P>
<P>
   Jockeys bank something less than 10 percent of their horses'
purses, so Pincay should have been a millionaire many times over.
When he discovered he wasn't _ after the IRS blindsided him with a
bill for more than $300,000 in back taxes in 1987 _ he sued his
longtime business manager. He eventually won a $2.9 million
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the financial mess, Pincay thought he'd have to
keep riding just for the money.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as he has fought the inevitable injuries (he
has broken his collarbones 12 times in his career) and horsemen's
inclination to patronize younger riders, his motivation has been
been somewhat grander. Pincay wants the record.
</P>
<P>
   He has been riding with his old vigor, winning about once a day
since the Hollywood Park season began Nov. 10, and now the question
is whether No.8,834 will come at Hollywood, which closes Dec. 20,
or at Santa Anita, which opens Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever it happens, the cheering section in the jockeys' room
will be thrilled for him.
</P>
<P>
   So will Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do deserve it,'' Pincay said when somebody posed the
question that nobody seems to be asking. ``There have been so many
times I thought about quitting, I thought about giving up, but
because of my love for the game, I kept hoping things would get
better. And they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I didn't give up.''

HOME SHOPPING SHOULD BE UCLA PRIORITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One forward comes from the West Indies, the other
grew up in Kansas City. The center is from Massachusetts, by way of
Holland. The point guard lives in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't the Lakers starting lineup. It's this year's UCLA
men's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing against Jerome Moiso, JaRon Rush, Dan Gadzuric and Earl
Watson, all talented young players with bright futures. But since
when does UCLA need to look any further than Southern California
for most of its players?
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it certainly seems as if Bruins coach Steve
Lavin would rather look elsewhere, based on the makeup of the
current roster. Aside from freshman Jason Kapono, who's from
Lakewood, the impact players come from out of state.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be so blatant, but with sensational freshmen like
Grant High's Gilbert Arenas and Glendora's Casey Jacobsen bursting
onto the national scene at Arizona and Stanford, respectively, UCLA
fans must be wondering why the Bruins didn't land at least one of
those gems.
</P>
<P>
   They might even think Lavin isn't tending to his own backyard,
that he foolishly thinks the talent is better in New York or
Chicago than Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   They're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, we'd like to have 80 percent of our roster from
(Southern California),'' Lavin said. ``It makes sense for a lot of
different reasons. But sometimes, maybe because a talent base was
thin one particular year or some kids weren't good fits
academically, we have to look elsewhere for players. Fortunately,
we have enough of a national name, even international, that we can
go into a Kansas City or a Michigan and get players.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, recruiting is such a wacky process, it behooves the Bruins
to mine every imaginable area for players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't put all your eggs in one basket like that,''
Lavin said. ``Let's say it's a down year for talent, or maybe
somebody decides to go someplace else, if you don't have a backup
plan, that could set you back a few years. Now you're looking at
the NIT.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapono is a great example of how things work out sometimes.
Basically, he was a gift that fell into Lavin's lap.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono desperately wanted to be a Bruin, and UCLA considered him
its No.1 recruit. But it also targeted forwards Carlos Boozer from
Alaska and Kareem Rush from Kansas City, plus Baron Davis was still
on the team, taking up a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono looked at the situation and decided he'd be better off
somewhere else. The Bruins felt he wasn't interested in them, and
they were right.
</P>
<P>
   Utah was in the picture, as was Rhode Island, Missouri, even
Nevada Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   It was a case of the player thinking the school didn't want him,
and the school thinking the player didn't want it.
</P>
<P>
   Then fate took over. Boozer and Rush settled on Duke and
Missouri, respectively. Davis left UCLA for the NBA, freeing up a
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Then it looked as if UNLV would go on probation, which took the
Running Rebels out of the picture. Missouri coach Norm Stewart
stepped down, eliminating the Tigers. Rhode Island fell out when
Jim Harrick moved to the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing you know, Kapono needs UCLA and the Bruins need
Kapono.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this is probably one of the best freshmen to come (to
UCLA) in 20 years or so,'' Lavin said. ``Sometimes you just never
know how it's going to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapono is exactly what UCLA needs, a mature, team-oriented
player not concerned about his own scoring or numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, if he gets homesick, it's just a 35-minute ride down the
San Diego freeway to Artesia _ OK, maybe an hour with traffic.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot different from the plane trips Watson and Rush have
to make to return home to the Midwest, which they've both done
during the season since arriving in Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA doesn't need that. The best players in the country reside
within a car-ride's trip from its campus. At the very least, there
are enough Southern California players to field a nationally
competitive team every single year.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. The core base for the Bruins' NCAA titles came
from California. Sure, every once in awhile John Wooden would reach
beyond the state line to pluck out an impact player, but only for
extreme talents like a Lew Alcindor or Lucius Allen.
</P>
<P>
   The rest came from California.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Walton, Keith Wilkes, Gail Goodrich, Keith Erickson, Lynn
Shackelford _ all kids from Southern California. All members of
Wooden's UCLA championship teams.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jim Harrick's 1995 NCAA champions had a distinct California
flavor. Ed and Charles O'Bannon came from Artesia, Toby Bailey from
Los Angeles and J.R. Henderson grew up in Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
   It just shows that the Bruins are better served concentrating on
the elite players from the area, rather than trying to pull in kids
from all across the country. That's not a knock on kids from New
York, Michigan or North Carolina, only that history has shown that
California players stack up against anyone from anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The key is keeping them home.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has a responsibility in that regard. The Bruins are the
standard bearer for West Coast basketball. Their objective each
year should be to build a team of home-grown players, then send
them off to represent this part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   They might not win every year. But we'll take our chances with
the kids from the neighborhood.

APPLEWHITE HAS `NO DOUBT' THAT HE WILL BE READY
</HEADLINE>
 12 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH AND WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas quarterback Major Applewhite remains on a diet of bread
and liquids, but said Monday there is ``no doubt'' he will be in
the lineup for Saturday's Big 12 championship game against
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite played only the fourth quarter of last week's 20-16
loss to Texas A&AMP;M because of a stomach virus. He experienced
dizziness and nausea during the game, symptoms that disappeared in
time for Applewhite to join teammates in Sunday conditioning
drills.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite will practice today for the first time since Friday's
game. He said he lost 7 pounds during the illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, I'm fine,'' Applewhite said. ``My head is clear
and my health is back.'' FAMILIAR ROLE
</P>
<P>
   Texas players, for the most part, smiled or shook their heads
Monday when asked about being 8-point underdogs to Nebraska. The
Longhorns are 3-0 against the Cornhuskers since the advent of the
Big 12, winning each time as decisive underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That fires you up,'' defensive end Cedric Woodard said.
``People don't respect us, but we'll still be Big 12 champs if we
win this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how many consecutive victories the Longhorns would need in
the series to qualify as favorites, Major Applewhite said: ``Maybe
100. But we're not worried about that.'' TOO WEIRD FOR WORDS
</P>
<P>
   Kwame Cavil, Texas' talkative wide receiver, found himself
speechless when asked to assign any significance to a historical
quirk about the Longhorns playing No. 3 Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has won its past six meetings against teams ranked third
in The Associated Press poll, including two in a row against
Nebraska (1999, 1996). Other No. 3 teams to fall included Houston
(1990), Alabama (1981), Oklahoma (1979) and Arkansas (1978).
</P>
<P>
   Texas' last loss to a third-ranked team came in 1965, when the
top-ranked Longhorns fell to No. 3 Arkansas, 27-24.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's too weird for me,'' Cavil said, laughing. ``But it's a
cool stat. I guess they should be wishing they were No. 2 or No.
4.'' NEBRASKA PLAYERS ENDORSE HOKIES
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska players and head coach Frank Solich on Monday gave
their endorsement _ sort of _ to the likelihood Virginia Tech will
play in the Sugar Bowl for the national championship as the
second-ranked team in the Bowl Championship Series rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that Virginia Tech deserves to play in the game because
they've done everything they were supposed to _ they've won every
game,'' rover Mike Brown said. ``We're satisfied playing Texas for
the Big 12 championship.''
</P>
<P>
   This view was echoed by I-back Dan Alexander, who said:
``They've handled their business all season _ there's no reason why
they ``shouldn't'' be going to the Sugar Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Solich was less enthusiastic about endorsing the Hokies, saying,
``Well, they've gone through undefeated, and they certainly are a
great team and should be congratulated. It's no small feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think if you look at strength of schedule, they've
played one team (currently) in the Top 25, and we've played
several. I know that's mixed into the formula, but I don't know how
it all weighs.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he will feel if his team avenges its only defeat, to
Texas, and is unable to play for the national title, Solich said,
``It's difficult to answer that question. You could make a case for
either team, and whoever gets left out will be disappointed. But we
all have to rely on some system, and the BCS is what we have in
place. Until we find something better, I think everyone needs to
get on board behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, this will all be a moot point if we don't beat
Texas.''

IF ANYONE CAN LIFT LAKERS, IT'S ZEN MASTER JACKSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Horace Grant isn't quite sure what to expect from Phil
Jackson and the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics center might walk into the locker room before the
game Tuesday night and find the place smoking like a Buddhist
temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lights incense. We'd walk into a room and it would be full
of smoke, to kill the evil spirits,'' Grant said, thinking back.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Phil being the Zen Master he is, he can sell swampland in
Alaska,'' Grant said, smiling, but with great respect.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Grant won three NBA championships with Jackson
in Chicago before heading to Orlando to team up with Shaquille
O'Neal, Grant has a little extra insight into the inner workings of
the new Phil Jackson Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team in which Woodstock collides with Showtime _ an
NBA, post-Jordan experiment that invites all sorts of skepticism
... unless you are Horace Grant.
</P>
<P>
   The wise veteran is sold on the idea that the Lakers will
prosper under Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know Phil's into the Zen stuff,'' Grant said. ``I have one
of those Zen books at home that I bought a couple of years ago. I
have to get that out of the closet and dust that off.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant wasn't exactly joking.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Jackson recommended a certain book to Grant _ a common
practice of Jackson's, whose mission is to draw respect and power
from players so that they form the sacred bond of a team. The last
time he tried this experiment, the Bulls won six NBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book was called `Joshua,' '' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about a carpenter who went into this little town, and
this carpenter turned out to be an angel, so to speak. Phil sort of
called me the diamond in the rough. The message of the book was to
be kind. Good things will happen to you. I think it's the workman's
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had so much respect for him, whenever he did something like
that, it was for a reason. Being a veteran ballclub, we were very
intrigued by the books he gave us.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Sonics have sprinted off to an eye-opening 11-3 record
and sit ahead of the Lakers in the feisty Pacific Division of the
loaded Western Conference, Grant thinks these cowabunga Lakers will
indeed catch hold of the psychic wave Jackson emits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Phil's first year. If anyone can convince a Michael
Jordan to run the triangle offense, then he can take care of the
situation in L.A. If he could contain a personality like Dennis
Rodman, he can take care of L.A.'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the world has been waiting for the Lakers to bust out
of their terrible toddler stage and seize control of the
postseason. The NBA Finals were supposed to be the Lakers' new
address.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the Magic Johnson stint as head coach _ one
that left the NBA great pulling his hair in anguish over the
selfishness of the Lakers players.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the Del Harris phase _ one that child-star Kobe Bryant
dismissed with the comment: ``Guys tuned out Del from Day One.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, last season there was the short-lived reign of Kurt
Rambis, who had no better luck with his juvenile charges than his
predecessors did.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports, Rambis had so little control of his
players that he once screamed at Bryant during a timeout: ``Fine,
do whatever you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's method is much less chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize, Phil is from the '70s. He's a straight-up
peace guy. He knows how to deal with different personalities,''
Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, despite the monstrous task of coalescing the bickering
Bryant and O'-Neal, a misplaced Glen Rice and a disgruntled Robert
Horry into a team, Jackson has had one major obstacle cleared.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, O'Neal has been especially eager to put his trust,
faith and career in Jackson's hands. And even if O'Neal is the
quintessential L.A., hip-hop, movie-star rapper, he is not a tough
sell on Jackson's psycho-spiritual methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (what Jackson preaches) is baloney,'' Grant
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to buy into it for it to be very successful. Shaq's
got to buy into it, and I think he's already done that. When I was
in Chicago, Michael had to buy into it first and everyone else fell
into order.''
</P>
<P>
   With the youthful Bryant out with a broken hand since training
camp, the Lakers have been able to establish O'Neal as the kingpin
of Jackson's vaunted triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   And while Jackson has lamented that O'Neal will be a flawed
leader until he overcomes his free-throw problems, O'-Neal is among
the league leaders in scoring, rebounding, blocked shots and
field-goal percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Batman is at work for L.A. Now the trick for Jackson will be to
establish Bryant as O'Neal's Robin _ much the same way Jordan had
Scottie Pippen as his running mate all those years in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Grant is convinced Jackson can get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Phil is he never lets it get old. Even during
film session. We'll be watching film ... and he would stick a clip
of `Slapshot' right in middle of it. Phil would just go to
`Slapshot' for like four or five minutes and we would just sit
there, watching,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was always a meaning behind something he does. Like
the time he put a clip of `Full Metal Jacket.' The scene of the
drill instructor just chewing this guy out. I guess Phil was just
sending a message to the guys who messed up the night before.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Lakers coming in to play the Sonics, it was always
interesting. Now, with the Zen Master in charge, it could be out of
this world.

PATTERSON LOOKS FORWARD TO FACING TEAM THAT CUT HIM LOOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sonics forward Ruben Patterson insisted he may not be
able to sleep, not with the Los Angeles Lakers in town.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. He has dreamed about Tuesday night's Pacific Division
showdown in KeyArena since the schedule was announced, eager to
show his old team what he has become in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd pleaser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a grudge against them,'' Patterson said. ``I can't
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   The first 14 games this season have been like a dream for the
second-year small forward. The Sonics are 11-3 in part because of
Patterson's youthfulness, athleticism and energy.
</P>
<P>
   Watching him play is often like waiting for the home run
distance to show on a major league scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   You can't wait to see how far he will go.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when he takes off like a jet, such as the night
in Philadelphia. What began with a leap just inside the foul line
ended with Patterson soaring past the 76ers' Larry Hughes for a
monster dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there are those occasions when he pounces like a tiger.
Allen Iverson knows. The prolific scorer was chased down from
midcourt only to have a would-be dunk pinned against the backboard
by Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Those are examples of how Patterson has permeated the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that he had a future in the
NBA,'' said Kurt Rambis, who coached Patterson last season with the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has some nice defensive potential. He does a great job
running the floor. He rebounds. He plays hard. But like most young
ballplayers, he has some things to work on. ... He's just a
hustle/effort kind of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics want Patterson to dive for loose balls rather than
attempt his so-so jump shot. However, it is Patterson's tenacity on
the boards and defensive skills that won him the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly made fans forget Detlef Schrempf, who was a staple at
the position for six seasons. Fact is, Patterson's 14.6 points and
7.1 rebounds a game are near what Schrempf produced (15.0 and 7.4)
last season.
</P>
<P>
   And Patterson is younger and more apt to defend the quicker,
brash small forwards in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to play against Ruben. That's one of the best
compliments you can give a player,'' teammate Brent Barry said.
``You'd hate to face him if he was on the opposing side. But I'm
glad he's on my team and I can throw alley-oops just about anywhere
because he can go get them. The bottom line is he comes out every
night for us a steady force. You know you're going to get
aggressive, 110 percent effort from him. That goes a long way in
making up for some of the deficiencies in your game.''
</P>
<P>
   His weakness is an inconsistent outside shot, but the Sonics saw
all they needed in the Boston summer league. There, he lived up to
the 1998 scouting reports after he left the University of
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   He obviously was dying to prove himself, and did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted a chance to show the world what I can do. A lot
of people are noticing what I'm doing for the Sonics,'' Patterson
said. ``So I'm just going to keep rebounding and giving it my all.
A lot of guys knew I was talented, and I'm a great player. I just
didn't have a chance to play (in Los Angeles). It feels good to
click on the TV and see myself sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson almost never saw Showtime in Los Angeles last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a grudge against them. I can't wait,'' Patterson said
of Tuesday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   His poor outside shot is one reason he did not fit in as a
rookie with the Lakers. It was a no-brainer that Rambis chose to
divide minutes between Kobe Bryant, Glen Rice and Rick Fox over
Patterson, whom the Lakers took 31st in the 1998 NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson averaged 2.7 points in six minutes a game. Rambis
concedes Patterson ``did a very good job of guarding Kobe in
practice. But practice and games are two different stories. There
are no fouls called in practice. ... Is he going to be a superstar
and all-star? I don't think so. But he's going to have a long,
constructive career.''
</P>
<P>
   So Patterson's productivity and popularity really has come out
of nowhere for the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were only sure of a couple of things,'' Sonics president
Wally Walker said. ``One, he is going to play hard. Two, he's going
to be very confident. He's not intimidated by anyone or any
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton hasn't been as impressed as most fans by Patterson's
impact. Payton has periodically taken Patterson aside to check his
attitude. Earlier this week, Payton even held a private film
session with Patterson to point out defensive weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I want him to succeed but I don't want him to get a
big head until he does something,'' Payton said. ``Ruben hasn't led
us to a championship. We haven't won anything. ... This is his
second year in the league. Let him keep building and don't look at
those papers and `SportsCenter' and say, `Whoa, I'm good.' I did
that my first three years and I struggled a lot. Then, I realized I
have to stop watching the papers and the news and just play
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came out and said the `Kobe Stopper' stuff, I didn't
like that. ... That's just running your mouth. As you see, a lot of
the (small forwards) have been killing us. They've been having 30
and 35 points. He hasn't been stopping them. So he's just a `Kobe
Stopper?' Naw. We don't want that. Prove it to people on the court
instead of with your mouth. Then, when you do that, it's a
different story. Right now, he's not playing defense to me. I'll
tell him and I'll tell whoever. He knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sonics coach Paul Westphal enjoys Patterson's passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't play in this league _ especially as a defensive
player _ and think any other way,'' Westphal said. ``You ask any
defensive player if he's afraid of who he's playing against. He'd
say `no' and you have to have that attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Patterson has epitomized attitude _ as well as altitude
and fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident I can play in this league,'' Patterson said.
``I'm just glad I'm in the right place at the right time.''

TEAMS RELYING ON RECEIVERS, NOT RUNNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this weird, wacky NFL season, one thing has become clear:
Teams are relying much more on their wide receivers than their
running backs to produce game-turning plays.
</P>
<P>
   In contests played Thursday and Sunday, there were 11 100-yard
receivers and only five 100-yard rushers. Over the season, there
have been 110 100-yard receiving days and only 72 100-yard rushing
days.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, the running games have been compromised by the
retirement of Barry Sanders, and the injuries to Jamal Anderson,
Terrell Davis, and Garrison Hearst. But offenses are also using
their wide receivers more because defenses are using more eight-
and nine-man fronts to stop the run and pressure the quarterback.
This alignment puts cornerbacks one-on-one with wide receivers, who
have capitalized by getting open with more frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Randy Moss, Jacksonville's Jimmy Smith, and
Indianapolis' Marvin Harrison are tied for the league lead with
five 100-yard receiving days. Smith, Moss, and New England's Terry
Glenn have all had one game with at least 200 yards receiving.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Cris Carter, Chicago's Marcus Robinson, Carolina's
Mushin Muhammad, Detroit's Germane Crowell, Denver's Ed McCaffrey,
Oakland's Tim Brown, and Kansas City's Derrick Alexander each have
four games with at least 100 yards receiving..
</P>
<P>
   Although Moss has a club-record 331 yards receiving in his past
two games, he isn't even the hottest receiver on his team.
</P>
<P>
   With 136 yards and two touchdowns against the Chargers, Carter
surpassed 100 yards for the fourth consecutive game. He has 10
touchdowns in the 22 quarters since Jeff George replaced Randall
Cunningham as the starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is a leading candidate for MVP honors. If he doesn't get
it, perhaps another wide receiver will. TRASH TALKING
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Giants linebacker Jesse Armstead openly ripped his
offense in the club's loss at Washington. Armstead, presumably with
foot in his mouth, was unavailable for comment after the Giants
defense allowed 34 points to the Arizona Cardinals, ranked 29th in
total offense.
</P>
<P>
   Said Giants defensive end Michael Strahan: ``I'm still trying to
figure it out. I don't know how in the world they scored 34
points.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who were 5-3 at the season's halfway mark, are now
5-6, and their playoff hopes are fading faster than team unity.
YOUNG BUC
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers rookie quarterback Shaun King is set to take over the
starting role with the season-ending injury to Trent Dilfer (broken
collarbone). But if King is to master the quarterback position, he
at least has to get the basics down.
</P>
<P>
   In the Buccaneers' 16-3 victory over the Seahawks, King tipped
off the Seahawks defense. While in the huddle, King would hold up
one finger if the snap count was, ``on one,'' and he'd hold up two
fingers if the snap count was, ``on two.''
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneerss guard Frank Middleton finally realized the Seahawks
were on to King.
</P>
<P>
   ``For goodness sake!'' Middleton roared at King. ``Don't tell
'em the snap count.'' OBSERVATIONS
</P>
<P>
   It's about time that Steelers coach Bill Cowher benched
quarterback Kordell Stewart. Stewart has had more than enough time
to learn the position. And while no one expected him to be perfect,
the Steelers did expect him to get better. Instead, he got worse
and is the sole reason the club as dropped home games to dreadful
Cleveland and Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   In their past two games, the Vikings defense has yielded
400-yard passing games to Jim Miller and Jim Harbaugh. Think Brett
Favre isn't betting he can get 500 when the Packers play at
Minnesota on Dec. 20?
</P>
<P>
   If the playoffs started today, the Cowboys would have the final
postseason spot. But that's not an entirely bad thing. Their first
playoff game would be at Washington, whom they've already swept
this year. It wouldn't get hairy until the next week, when they'd
have to play at St. Louis. Grading the NFL Vikings Air Game: A
Against the Chargers, Randy Moss, Jake Reed, and Cris Carter all
had touchdowns in the same game for the first time since Moss
joined the club last season. Denver Broncos: D Don't give me the
John Elway-Terrell Davis-Shannon Sharpe excuse. On offense they
average more total yards per game than Buffalo, Dallas, Detroit,
Tennessee, Seattle, Miami, and Tampa Bay. On defense they allow
fewer yards per game than St. Louis, Dallas, New England,
Tennessee, Detroit, Seattle, Green Bay, Washington and Minnesota.
So why is Denver 4-7? Dick Vermeil: A With his club already leading
the Saints, 36-12, the Rams coach could have ordered his club to
kneel on the ball late in the game. Instead, he called a simple
running play that sent a backup running back into the line for a
short touchdown with 1:14 remaining. ``I thought about kneeling on
the ball down there, but Mike Ditka is not a kneel-down type guy,''
Vermeil quipped. ``I don't think he would accept that as a gesture
of sportsmanship. That's not his nature.'' Good thinking, Dick.
LYONS' Top 5 1. Indianapolis 9-2 2. Jacksonville 10-1 3. Tennessee
9-2 4. St. Louis 9-2 5. South Grand Prairie (Tx) High, 12-1 (This
spot was to be for either Miami or Seattle, but those teams
combined to score a whopping three points in their respective
games. The Warriors, meanwhile, are in the state quarterfinals.) nn

BIG 12, COTTON LOOK TO BCS FOR CLARITY

 BOWL-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Big 12 Conference's bowl picture could come into sharper
focus Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series has a regularly scheduled
conference call Tuesday during which it will identify teams that it
is not considering for bowls. There are two at-large bids available
and three candidates _ Kansas State, Michigan and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   While it appears that Michigan and Tennessee _ both 9-2 _ will
be selected ahead of 10-1 Kansas State, Big 12 commissioner Kevin
Weiberg said last night he remains hopeful the Wildcats will land
an at-large berth. If that happens, it could mean an extra $13
million for the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still working diligently to make that happen,'' he said.
``If the BCS decides to release Kansas State, then we'll know we're
not getting a team in an at-large berth.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Weiberg will push the Big 12 to make
contingency plans based on the outcome of Saturday's Nebraska-Texas
conference championship game. Weiberg will meet by telephone with
Big 12 athletic directors Tuesday to discuss the bowl situation.
</P>
<P>
   Weiberg said he would like for the league to start finalizing
its bowl matchups so that the teams and the bowls can start selling
tickets and making arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Nebraska-Texas game will get the Big 12's
automatic berth in the BCS and likely will play in the Jan. 2
Fiesta Bowl. If Texas loses, the Longhorns could play in either the
Holiday or Alamo bowls. If Nebraska loses, the Cornhuskers would
play in the Cotton Bowl, probably against Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   If Nebraska defeats Texas, that would probably send Kansas State
to the Cotton Bowl. There have been rumors that Kansas State
officials would prefer a trip to the Holiday Bowl and would be
willing to swap places with Texas, allowing the Cotton Bowl to
stage a game between the Longhorns and the Razorbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that Kansas State will be very open to
playing in the Cotton Bowl,'' Weiberg said. ``And our agreements
don't allow for that kind of a swap or deal to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiberg said that Texas A&AMP;M has a chance to be selected by the
Holiday Bowl. If that happens, Texas could go to the Fiesta Bowl
with a victory in the Big 12 championship game and to the Alamo
Bowl with a loss. nn

TROUBLED ROOKIE SAYS TEAM ABANDONED HIM, SOURCE SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An NBA source said the Mavericks refused to give
rookie forward Leon Smith complimentary tickets to two home games,
forcing him to purchase tickets from a scalper.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based source also said Smith admitted he attempted
suicide Nov. 14, and left a note thanking Mavericks coach/general
manager Don Nelson and his son, assistant coach Donnie Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the note didn't say thank you for providing the
opportunity to play in the league, or thank you for being gracious
in helping me,'' the source said. ``The note just said, `Thank you
Don and Donnie.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Leon what did he mean when he wrote the note, and he
said, `I was saying thank you Don and Donnie for messing me over,
because if it wasn't for them I wouldn't be in this predicament.'
''
</P>
<P>
   When Don Nelson was asked before last night's game against the
New York Knicks about Smith, he said the NBA had asked him not to
talk about Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, executive director of the National Basketball
Players Association, said Smith left his aftercare players
assistance program in Atlanta and has been back at his Oak
Lawn-area apartment since Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purvis Short (of the NBPA) and I were with him until (Nov.
24), then I left to come back here and Purvis went back to
Houston,'' Hunter said Monday. ``Purvis returned to Dallas
(Monday), and is there now with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purvis went to Dallas to help Leon open up a checking and
savings account, and also help him to get some ID. He doesn't have
any picture ID, so he's trying to help him get a driver's
license.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's agent, Matt Muehlebach, said he couldn't comment on
Smith's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when the time is right everybody will be willing to
say everything they can,'' Muehlebach said. ``We're just trying to
do what we can to protect him and give him an opportunity to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of people pulling for him. We all hope
it's going to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   The league source said Smith purchased tickets from a scalper
for the Mavericks' Nov. 9 home game against the Los Angeles Lakers,
and the Nov. 13 game against Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 14, Smith was found passed out in his apartment after an
apparent overdose of aspirin, according to a police report.
</P>
<P>
   While Don Nelson has repeatedly said Smith got a lot of
attention from developmental coaches Bill Peterson and Kiki
Vandeweghe, and from player personnel director Amadou Gallo Fall,
the league source said Smith told him he felt like an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistreatment was so bad that basically Leon was informed
that he shouldn't come around, and that they didn't want him in
touch with anybody on the team, and they didn't even want him
around the arena because it would distract the team,'' the source
said. ``Leon is a young kid, and he thinks Dallas drafted him
because they were interested in him, and they were going to give
him a fair shake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of Leon's vulnerability is due to the fact that this kid
has been rejected all of his life. This is the first time he's been
given an opportunity to step up, and when he didn't get that
opportunity he just didn't
</P>
<P>
   know which way to go; he didn't know how to digest it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter stopped short of saying Smith should ask the Mavericks to
trade him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the other players in the league have had no
difficulties making the transition from high school and college to
the NBA,'' Hunter said. ``In each of those instances, they all had
support networks that were put in place for the kid, and apparently
there was nothing put in place to assist Leon.'' nn

FREEDOM BEGINS WITH ELATION AND PRAYER 
</HEADLINE>
  (With IMMIG-DETAIN)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the first things that Nasser K. Ahmed did in
his first hour of freedom on Monday night was to pray for five
minutes at the Al-Bader mosque, about a half-block from his
apartment in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a Muslim tradition,'' he explained. ``You praise God
when he delivers you from trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed, 39, was allowed to leave the Metropolitan Correctional
Center in Manhattan at 8:15 p.m. after three and a half years in
federal detention while the Immigration and Naturalization Service
sought to deport him to Egypt using secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed was elated to be able to return home to his wife of 13
years, Salwa Al-Byadi, 38, formerly a physician in Egypt, and their
three children, but he was still bitter at the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, boy, the kids are driving me crazy now, taking Polaroids
of everybody,'' Ahmed said in a telephone interview. ``It's been
three and half years now, and I still have no idea who accused me
or why they accused me. But this I know. What the government did
was similar to what happened in Waco, Texas. They tried to destroy
that religion, the Branch Davidians. There is no doubt that this,
too, is a government conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the evidence against Ahmed was released and successfully
refuted by his lawyers. Perhaps the most damaging allegation was
that Ahmed visited Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian
cleric convicted in 1995 of conspiring to plant bombs at the United
Nations and other New York landmarks, and that Ahmed carried one of
the cleric's letters out of prison. When published, the letter is
said to have led to an attack by Muslim fundamentalists against
tourists in Egypt in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there were at least two other people at the prison three
days before I visited,'' said Ahmed, who denies any involvement in
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed acted as a paralegal for the sheik during his trial. ``I
definitely admire and respect and love him,'' Ahmed said. ``And he
did not do what the government said he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed, who worked as an electrical engineer before he was
detained, doubts that he could return to his job after so much
time. ``I may have to go back to school,'' he said. ``My future is
the most difficult question to answer now.''

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Moscow) _ After two months of steady advances
into Chechnya's heartland, the Russian military said on Monday that
it is beginning to encounter serious resistance from Islamic
militants, and that the fighting is likely to intensify in the next
few weeks. By Michael R. Gordon.

   CUBA-CHILD (Miami) _ A 5-year-old Cuban boy who survived a
Thanksgiving Day rafting tragedy by clinging to an inner tube for
two days has become the focus of an international tug-of-war. Cuba
blames the United States for the tragedy and says the child had
been kidnapped by his mother, who died during the voyage. The boy's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and Cuba's Foreign Ministry have
demanded his return. Gonzalez has filed a complaint with the United
Nations to draw international attention to the issue. By David
Gonzalez.

   BUSH-BOOK (New York) _ A small Manhattan publishing house has
agreed to publish 25,000 copies of James Hatfield's controversial
book on George W. Bush, ``Making of an American President.'' The
author stands by the drug charges in the book but admits to his own
prison past. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   PRISON-CALLS (Undated) _ For Ruth Smith, the telephone call from
prison was a way for her cousin to speak with his dying mother. For
Tulen Rivera, the calls from prison are an opportunity for her
three boys to speak with their father. For Ruby Jackson, speaking
by phone with her imprisoned husband was a chance to talk without
having to spend eight hours on an overnight bus. But for New York
state, like most other states, telephone calls from prison are
something else. They are a way to make money. Under current state
policy, the families of inmates are charged the highest possible
rates for calls from prisons, and most of the money is kept by the
state. By John Sullivan.

watched on closed-circuit television monitors as a tiny
experimental device was implanted in a patient's coronary artery.
The doctors heard the voice of Dr. Martin Leon, who was describing
the operation taking place in a hospital many miles away. But Leon
was anything but a disinterested observer. What he did not tell the
assembled doctors was that he was an investor in the company that
manufactured the device. He is not the only one to wear many hats
in the world of medical devices. Inventors are researchers.
Researchers are promoters. Promoters are investors. And, finishing
the circle, investors are inventors. It is a phenomenon found in

   DOLLAR-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ One of the constants in
financial markets is that they regularly defy expectations. This is
true of the newest leg of the Japanese yen rally against the dollar
and the euro's plunge against the dollar and the yen. If they
continue, these moves could produce a numerical symmetry never seen
in the currency markets: the world's three major currencies all at

   SCI-CAROLINA-FLOODS (Undated) _ Scientists fear that the
post-hurricane flood of eastern North Carolina has created an
ecological time bomb, and they fear for the biologically rich
waters that separate the famous Outer Banks from the Carolina
mainland. This complex of sounds, bays and inlets comprises the
second largest estuary in the country, after Chesapeake Bay, and is
one of the nation's most important incubators of marine life.
Rarely have ecologists confronted such a striking example of what
can happen when a first-order natural disturbance is combined with
a first-order disturbance of the natural world by humans. By
William K. Stevens.

<P>
   SCI-AIDS-POLIO (Undated) _ The Doctor's World: The provocative
theory that AIDS is a manufactured disaster arising from early
testing of the polio vaccine in Africa seemed farfetched when it
first came to public attention, in an article in Rolling Stone in
1992. Most scientists dismissed it after a scientific committee
reviewed the theory and deemed the probability very low. But that
panel based its conclusion in part on a published finding that was
later shown to be in error. And now a remarkable new book, ``The
River'' by Edward Hooper, offers tantalizing clues to revive and
expand the polio vaccine theory. By Lawrence K. Altman.

   SCI-MARS-POLE (Undated) _ Less than a century after explorers
made their first heroic assault on the poles of Earth, an American
spacecraft is racing toward Mars and the first landing in the polar
region of another planet. The robotic Mars Polar Lander is being
aimed for a landing on Friday on the vast terraces of ice and dust
a few hundred miles from the planet's south pole. Spring is turning
to summer there, the season of constant sunlight, which the
spacecraft will draw on for energy to power its computer and
transmitter and array of cameras, sensors, digging arm and ovens

unusual eating habits and the Eberly telescope. By Henry Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FEVERS (Undated) _ Fevers can be mysterious, which is when
the challenges multiply. The hospital is always filled with
patients with fevers no one understands. In some, it is a sign of
an underlying disease that is not yet known. In other people, like
AIDS or cancer patients with suppressed immune systems, the fever
may have any number of causes, including their underlying disease
or, most dangerously, an infection that could rapidly kill if left
untreated. Whatever the case may be, mysterious fevers are common,
and among the most vexing of medical problems. By Sandeep Jauhar.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHILDREN-SPEECH (Undated) _ Parents now are being told to
seek speech therapy earlier for children who are exhibiting
problems, a sharp change from previous years when adults were
assured that often, very bright children did not learn to speak
until they were much older. The new advice is based, in part, on
studies showing that children with speech impairments are more
likely to have reading and social problems later on. By Randi
Hutter Epstein.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Research showing much puberty for
girls arriving much earlier than previous studies had shown could
force textbooks and medical schools to revise the age at which
puberty is considered premature. Current medical textbooks state
that just 1 percent of girls younger than 8 show signs of puberty.
In a new review of existing data, in the Oct. 4 issue of the
journal Pediatrics, researchers concluded that ``the onset of
breast development between 7 and 8 years of age in white girls and
between 6 and 8 years in African-American girls may be part of the
normal broad variation in the timing of puberty and not, in most
cases, a pathological state.'' By Jane E. Brody.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OLDER-ATHLETES (Undated) _ A new generation of older
athletes are healthier than their predecessors, living longer and

USC FALLS SHORT IN BID FOR UPSET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC wants to consider itself on the path back to
the elite among women's basketball teams. Texas Tech showed Monday
night the Trojans have some work ahead.
</P>
<P>
   USC led the 16th-ranked Red Raiders for most of the game, but
Tech overcame a six-point deficit in the final two minutes of
regulation and won 66-63 in overtime at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Plenette Pierson's one-handed bank shot with one second
to play forced overtime. It was her first career buzzer-beater and
it gave her a game-high 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tech (4-0), specifically guard Katrissa O'Neal (17 points),
took advantage of its athleticism, using a back-door play
effectively to build a 64-60 lead. Despite committing 27 turnovers,
USC (2-1) had a chance to tie in the closing seconds, but Ayesha
Smith's 3-point attempt was long.
</P>
<P>
   This was USC's first overtime game since Dec. 29, 1996, a
double-overtime loss to Western Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a classic example of _ I don't want to be a
cliche-ist,'' USC coach Chris Gobrecht said, ``but we stopped doing
the things that got us there: pressure, denial. We just froze up
and let them take it from us, which I hope is a hard lesson for a
team that has never done this before.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, USC hasn't beaten a Top 25 team since March 2, 1996,
against then-No. 22 Oregon State. And on paper, it didn't appear
the game would be this close.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Trojans haven't played together for long. Their top
scorers Monday, Denise Woods (19 points, 8 rebounds) and Danielle
Golay (14 points, 6 rebounds) are transfers. Plus, Texas Tech came
in with five players averaging in double figures. Yet USC used its
advantage in the post to go on a 12-3 run in the last 4:59 of the
first half and lead 33-26 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans defense limited Tech to 32-percent first-half
shooting and 39 for the game. Guard Aleah Johnson, averaging 17.3
points, scored zero in the first half and finished with nine. USC
also outrebounded Tech 43-33.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to run plays and they weren't working,''
Pierson said.
</P>
<P>
   Golay, meanwhile, was effective down low, scoring 10 straight
points, including the first six of the second half, giving USC its
biggest lead _ 39-30 with 17:02 to play.
</P>
<P>
   When the Red Raiders contained Golay, Woods came off the bench
and took over. She scored the go-ahead basket with 15 seconds to
play in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot to develop in terms of the eye of the tiger,''
Gobrecht said. ``This is a good basketball team that has a lot of
toughening up to do.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE teams he played on at Texas might be described as streaky. His
first year, the Longhorns won their last four, including a shutout
of Ole Miss in the Bluebonnet Bowl. His junior year, their six
victories came in the middle of the season, and when he was a
senior they finished by winning their last nine.
</P>
<P>
   But there was nothing uneven or inconsistent about the career of
Chris Gilbert, who pretty much gave you 100 yards per game on the
ground and knew how to break the long ones, the way little boys run
for touchdowns in their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Next week it will all come back to him _ if any of it ever left
_ the games and golden moments of more than 30 years ago. On Dec.
7, a day that will not live in infamy, Chris will become the 10th
Texas player to be inducted into the College Hall of Fame. Bobby
Layne, the blond bomber of the mid-1940s, was the first to be
honored, in 1968, Gilbert's senior year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the legendary Texas running backs, he joins Jimmy Saxton,
who came before, and Earl Campbell, who came after him. The
ceremonies will be in the grand ballroom of New York's Waldorf
Astoria, and Gilbert will be part of a class that includes Herschel
Walker of Georgia, Greg Pruitt of Oklahoma, John Hannah of Alabama
and Billy Kilmer of UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his selection was announced in April, Chris has been
hearing from old teammates and friends saying how happy they are
for him. It would hardly be possible to feel any other way, because
Chris Gilbert hasn't changed since he was a schoolboy out of Spring
Branch. He has the gifts of gratitude and modesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awfully flattering,'' he says, ``to do something 30 years
ago and have it remembered and honored all these years later.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not have been hard to remain humble when Texas finished
6-4 when he was a sophomore and junior, seasons Darrell Royal
described as ``disasters.'' By Texas standards, they were.
</P>
<P>
   But Chris went quietly about his business, getting an education
and slip-sliding away for lots of yardage. That first season, he
rushed for 245 yards against Baylor. As a junior, he had a 96-yard
run against TCU that is still the longest from scrimmage in Texas
history. He also carried the ball 38 times against Arkansas and
ended the game without any body parts missing.
</P>
<P>
   That season the Longhorns rallied to beat Oklahoma 9-7 after
trailing at the half and hearing Royal lecture them in the locker
room: ``There's a heck of a fight going on out there. Why don't you
guys get in on it?''
</P>
<P>
   In each of his three seasons, Gilbert rushed for more than 1,000
yards, a feat that had never been accomplished before in college
football in the days of the 10-game schedule. He did a couple of
things Campbell and Ricky Williams, the UT Heisman Trophy winners,
did not do. He averaged better than 100 yards per game each year
and was voted the Most Valuable Player by each of his teams.
</P>
<P>
   But Chris never gave anyone the impression he was about scooping
up records and honors. Loyalty and friendship were the rewards for
the 5-11, 175-pound tailback, who turned down a chance to play in
the pros with the New York Jets. He chose a career in business, and
he chose wisely. He and his roommate, Corby Robertson, are partners
today in a sports camp outside Austin, one of several enterprises
Gilbert has seen turn into successes.
</P>
<P>
   It may be old-fashioned, even out of date, but the National
Football Foundation counts such things when it chooses a former
player for membership in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   This was a week for remembering, given the Bonfire tragedy at
Aggieland and a game in which emotion flowed like lava. Chris
thought back to his last regular-season game for Texas, standing on
the sideline at Memorial Stadium, watching the clock tick down on a
one-sided Longhorns victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was over at halftime,'' he said, ``and we had our
third- and fourth-stringers on the field at the end. I didn't even
think about finishing my Texas career on the sideline. I just
thought about how great it felt, knowing we had accomplished
something, had gotten on a roll and had turned the program
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas had averaged almost 500 yards per game, over 330 on the
ground, with the wishbone-T that Royal and Emory Bellard had
developed in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most fun I had,'' said Chris, ``was in practice, watching
coach Royal and coach Bellard invent plays on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first two years, we played power ball. I was the only
running back in the I-formation, and that was pretty much the
offense. The wishbone was a totally different animal. It was a
wonderful change for me to become part of a multifaceted offense.
We had James Street, Ted Koy, Steve Worster and myself in the
backfield, and it brought out the best in everybody.''

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ The great thing about playing an archrival is that you
don't have to worry about getting up for the game.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bad thing about playing an archrival is that it is often
difficult to get up for the next game.
</P>
<P>
   That is not particularly good news for Texas, considering it is
coming off an emotional loss to Texas A&AMP;M and its next opponent is
the No. 3-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers in Saturday's Big 12
Championship Game at the Alamodome in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But the Longhorns say there's no need to worry about their being
able to bounce back. Something would be really amiss if they can't
get up for Nebraska, especially with the Big 12 title on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we're playing Nebraska is probably good after
the loss to Texas A&AMP;M, because it's not our last game,'' Texas
coach Mack Brown said. ``Our guys have so much respect for the
Nebraska team that they'll get themselves back up and be ready to
play. If we were playing somebody we didn't respect this week, it
would be very difficult. We'll have to move through the A&AMP;M game
very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he has found it less difficult to prepare his team
when it is an underdog, as it is against the Cornhuskers, rather
than a favorite, as it was against the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to coach in Austin when it's a big game
against an opponent that the fans and the media respect than
against a team with a losing record or a team that you're supposed
to beat,'' Brown said. ``That's hard around here. I've learned in
two years that it's hard when everybody says that a team is not
going to beat you to get your team to listen. But when everybody
says you're going to get beat, there's no question the team
listens, so they'll be focused for this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Kwame Cavil said it may not be that easy to toss
aside the A&AMP;M loss, but the Longhorns know that with quarterback
Major Applewhite slowed by illness and receivers Ryan Nunez (toe)
and Jeremy Jones (ankle) out of the game with injuries, they were
far from being at full strength.
</P>
<P>
   With Applewhite not playing until the fourth quarter because of
a stomach virus, Texas had its worst passing game of the season
against the Aggies, mustering just 183 yards through the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just write it off,'' Cavil said. ``That's a rivalry
game. It sticks with you all your life. But we'll be all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The passing performance) was a concern, but I knew we didn't
have all of our bullets in the chamber. We know what we're capable
of doing. We've done it before. You have to play with the cards
you're dealt sometimes, and we were dealt a bad hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns may have helped deal themselves a poor hand by
adding an extra game this year. Texas opened the season Aug. 28
against North Carolina State. Fifteen weeks later, the Longhorns
will play their 13th game.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that to a typical team like Texas Tech, which began its
11-game season a week after Texas and ended it two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Texas already has nine wins, typically a good season, but should
it lose to Nebraska and in a bowl, it will finish with five losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine wins is a whole lot of wins for any team,'' Brown said.
``Next year we play a 12th game with Hawaii. I'm not sure if you
should do that here. A&AMP;M did it last year. If you're going to have
to play 14 games with the championship game in the Big 12 and the
SEC, I'm not sure that you should put your kids in that position,
because it makes the season so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe we're playing a 13th game this weekend,
and we're not through. It's hard to imagine. But I'm not going to
let anything that happens diminish what this team has been able to
accomplish. This is a team that people were talking about winning
five (games). I don't want to talk about a loss Saturday or a
possible loss in a bowl game because that would be negative, and
that's not my style.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said it doesn't matter how many games his team has played.
This one is special, and he won't have to use any tricks to get his
squad ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team will be motivated for this game. I mean, it's the
championship game,'' Brown said. ``This is an easy week for both
teams to motivate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about our team is they respect the Nebraska
team and program, but they're not intimidated by 'em, so they'll
enjoy this game.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Nebraska's players seem resigned to the fact that their chances of
playing for the national championship probably have ended, but
their coach continues to state his team's case.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nebraska coach Frank Solich believes a convincing victory over
Texas in the Big 12 Championship Game on Saturday should give the
third-ranked Cornhuskers a chance at passing Virginia Tech for a
spot against top-ranked Florida State in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at it a couple of different ways,'' Solich said.
``It's a difficult issue. Without question, Virginia Tech should be
congratulated on going undefeated because it's not a small feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you look at it on strength of schedule and look at the
teams they have played, the only one that is in the Top 25 at the
end of the season is Boston College, and they just got in a week
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech ended the regular season 11-0 after defeating
Boston College 38-14 on Friday. BC fell from No. 22 to No. 25 in
the Associated Press poll after losing to the Hokies.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech played three other teams that were ranked when
they faced them _ Virginia, Syracuse and Miami _ but the Hokies
have not played a Top 10 team this season.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska (10-1) has played four teams that are ranked among the
top 18 in the latest AP poll, including eighth-ranked Kansas State,
which the Cornhuskers defeated 41-15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on how you look at it,'' Solich said.
``Strength of schedule is mixed into the equation, but I don't know
how much. I know Virginia Tech has an excellent football team, and
I know how hard it is to go undefeated. We lost one game, which
came down to the end (24-20), to an excellent Texas team.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Bowl Championship Series rankings that came out Monday,
Virginia Tech increased its lead over Nebraska from .63 to 1.54.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virginia Tech has handled its business all season and came out
on top,'' said Nebraska defensive back Mike Brown. ``Going
undefeated speaks highly of their team. They deserve a shot (at the
national championship) as much as anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also would be proud if we ended up with a spot in the
big game. It's every player's dream to play for a national
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The final BCS standings, which determine the teams that will
play in the title game in New Orleans, will be released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies' advantage, according to one BCS computer expert, is
all but impossible to overcome _ even if Nebraska routs Texas in
the Alamodome at San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no suspense,'' said Chicago-based BCS computer wizard
Jerry Palm. ``If Nebraska wins 50-0, I'm not sure that could
overtake Virginia Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   The BCS standings are based on a formula that considers the AP
media poll and the USA Today/ESPN coaches poll, eight computer
rankings, strength of schedule and losses.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska probably blew its chance by barely beating unranked
Colorado 33-30 in overtime Friday after the Buffaloes missed a
field-goal attempt that would have won the game at the end of the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways we were fortunate to come out ahead,'' Solich
said. ``But in other ways our team came back at the end and got it
done. I'm proud of what our team has done down the stretch against
Texas A&AMP;M, Kansas State and Colorado. In two of those three games,
the score would indicate it was not close.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska players don't seem to have Solich's zeal for making
an argument in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel Virginia Tech deserves it,'' said Nebraska running back
Dan Alexander. ``They haven't lost, and they've proven they are a
quality team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not concentrating on the BCS right now,'' said kicker
Josh Brown. ``Our goal always has been to win the Big 12
championship, and now we have to beat Texas to do it. Whatever else
happens is not in our control.''
</P>
<P>
   Solich was pleased to hear his players aren't worrying about the
BCS rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell our players are concentrating on winning this
game,'' Solich said. ``We're not trying to battle for position
here. We're trying to win a game against Texas, and that's no easy
task.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to overcome a major hurdle in the Longhorns before we
can be considered for anything else. If we don't win the Big 12
championship, it's all a moot point. If we do, it will come down to
the people who do the voting and enter the numbers into the
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   The people crunching the numbers say the Cornhuskers probably
can't do enough to finish No. 2 in the complicated BCS formula that
has many fans screaming for a playoff format.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the system we have in place, and until a better system
comes on board, we have to get behind it,'' Solich said. ``But
certainly there will be some disappointment for the team that gets
left out.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ If there was any chance they might
actually do it, Rockets officials might be tempted to have Compaq
Center crowds boo Steve Francis lustily. He could pretend his name
was Lou or assume some similar-sounding nickname and respond as he
did Monday night, as if lifted to some new level.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grizzlies fans threw everything they had at Francis, from taunts
to insults to fresh fruit. Months of waiting to rebut the wrongs
they believed he did them built up until a crowd normally
anesthetized by losing was venomous and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Francis won the argument with his play, refusing to be rattled
by the treatment. More impressively, he won the game by refusing to
let the Rockets lose.
</P>
<P>
   Francis nailed a last-chance jumper to send the game to
overtime, then carried the Rockets to a secure lead. And after he
jogged off toward safety with 35.8 seconds remaining, he headed
happily out of town with a 118-100 win over Vancouver and his best
game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy, but I didn't want anybody to get hurt,'' said
Francis, whose only response to the crowd was a salute when he
fouled out with 2:45 left in overtime. ``I never knew people took
it that seriously to try to injure somebody. I didn't know they
were that serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I just played Steve Francis basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as he might have learned to thrive in such an
environment, his teammates might have learned something about him.
Francis finished with 24 points on 10-of-18 shooting and had 10
assists, nine rebounds, two blocked shots, two steals and zero
turnovers. And he was at his best with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was first and foremost,'' Rockets forward Carlos Rogers
said. ``Everybody had a part, but the way Steve played tonight, you
can't say enough about him. We used to get on him about turnovers,
and he had none. And 10 assists. He did everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything, however, was not enough until he added a little more
with the Rockets at the brink of what has become a typical night.
Charles Barkley had 22 points. Kelvin Cato had 10 rebounds and five
blocked shots. The Rockets' bench came up with an irreplaceable 50
points.
</P>
<P>
   But with Grizzlies fans still howling and the Rockets down to
their last breaths, Francis took an inbounds pass from Matt Bullard
and with 2.6 seconds left in regulation nailed a jumper from just
inside the 3-point line to force overtime.
</P>
<P>
   He even began overtime with a 3-pointer, and the Rockets never
slowed down. Cuttino Mobley hit a technical free throw after an
illegal-defense call. Francis passed to Barkley for a jumper, then
passed to Bullard for a 3, then nailed a jumper to put the Rockets
ahead 111-106. Even after Francis fouled out, Bullard nailed
another 3 to put the Rockets ahead 114-106.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great that everybody hit big shots,'' Francis said.
``They missed free throws at the end, and we hit the shots we had
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mobley, ``Those were the shots we were missing. We made
them tonight, and hopefully it will carry over.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a difference in the shots made Monday and the many
late shots missed in previous games. On Monday, they were knocked
down with the Rockets back in the role of enemy, rather than
struggling former power. Halfway through the fourth quarter, the
15,086 in GM Place grew particularly ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the direction the night was turning, Barkley took the
attention and pressure, at first drawing the wrath of the
Grizzlies' fans and then inspiring them to begin tossing produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' Barkley said of his attention-grabbing response
to the fans. ``I've done that many times in my career. I felt like
it worked to my advantage to get them on my case, and Steve played
really well after that.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Barkley was trying to take the pressure off his protege,
he also took over the game. After twice missing free throws, he
passed to a cutting Kenny Thomas for a layup, posted up and drove
to a layup, then drew a foul, sandwiching two made free throws
around the cleanup of a lemon smashed across the court.
</P>
<P>
   After Barkley put the Rockets up 89-85 with a steal and a dunk,
that was enough to make the Grizzlies to do whatever they needed to
take the ball out of his hands. In the final 3{ minutes of the
fourth quarter, Kelvin Cato missed a layup and a 12-footer, Mobley
missed a 10-footer on the baseline, and the Rockets seemed to be
themselves setting up another close defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The miss that seemed to hurt the most came with 29 seconds left
and the Rockets down by two. Francis drove to the lane, drew the
defense on him, then sent a pass outside to an uncovered Barkley.
After first thinking better of it, Barkley launched a 3 that
missed. Sharif Abdur-Rahim made two free throws for a four-point
lead. And when Francis missed a free throw with 20 seconds left,
the Rockets were a few Mike Bibby free throws away from being 3-12.
</P>
<P>
   But Bibby missed a free throw, and Mobley nailed a 3. And with
10.4 seconds left, Bibby missed another free throw to give Francis
an opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did an unbelievable job not making it too big a deal,''
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``I know his emotions were
high. If he would have reacted differently, it would have been
common. He's young, and he's never been through a situation like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   He ended up winning the battle with Bibby, the point guard
Francis believed already had his job when the Grizzlies selected
him.
</P>
<P>
   And he even proved himself a pretty fair evaluator of talent. He
said he didn't want to play in Vancouver because Bibby was already
there and was himself a gifted point guard. Bibby proved him right,
leading the Grizzlies with 25 points on 9-of-18 shooting. But he
had just five assists with six turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a free throw that I should have hit to seal the
game, but I missed it,'' Bibby said. ``I put a lot of blame on me.
We've got to finish games off. That's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have been saying the same thing. But Monday, they
didn't have to, instead singing the praises of the center of
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be a great player one day,'' Barkley said. ``The
best way to shut them up is to play like he did tonight.''

KEEPING AN EYE ON HIS INVESTMENT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ A short, round 80-year-old man comes every day
to the construction site of the new USF law library. He pulls up a
chair and watches the work, for hours, as if the pounding and
pouring and puttering were a great sunset or a wonderful movie.
<P>
   But it's better than that for Art Zief. The library is his baby
and he's watching the birth.
</P>
<P>
   Art is a graduate of the USF law school. As an undergrad in the
early '40s, he was an athlete. Sort of. The Dons' freshman
basketball team had 13 jerseys, and Art got the 13th. He scored one
basket in his career, and judging from his stature, I'm guessing it
wasn't a slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Art loves the school and decided last March to give $3.2 million
to the library, which will carry his wife's name, Dorraine Zief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not  &UR; my  &LR; library,'' Art says, but he's the only guy I
ever knew who bought a season ticket to a construction site.
</P>
<P>
   The best part, he says, was watching the steel go up. When the
steel boys finished their amazing work, the general contractor
threw them a big lunchtime pizza party right there on site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Art,'' the steel workers called to the old guy in the
chair, ``get over here and join the party.''
</P>
<P>
   For $3.2 million, Zief got a slice of pizza and a can of soda,
and he can't believe what a sweet deal it is.
</P>
<P>
   SECURITY LITE: Karen Warner was heading for Thanksgiving dinner
at relatives' house, and her sister-in-law asked her to bring a
sharp knife for the turkey. So Warner wrapped a large carving knife
in a paper towel, put it in her purse and forgot about it.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to dinner, Karen and her boyfriend stopped at SFO to
pick up an arriving relative. Karen sent her purse through the
X-ray machine and ... nothing happened. So she carried her purse,
with carving knife, to the meet-the-plane area, then to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think paper towels deflect X-rays?'' Karen asks.
</P>
<P>
   HOBO.COM: The National Hobo Society has a Web site (hobo.org)
which, I would guess, gives tips on the best ways to do nothing.
There's also a goodwife.com, offering mail-order brides online,
possibly to hobos.
</P>
<P>
   Which has my pal Lonesome Lefty wondering when someone will
write a country song about how ``I lost my online bride to my best
pal, Clyde.''
</P>
<P>
   BEAT A PARKING ticket? It might be possible to successfully
appeal a citation in San Francisco, but the bar is set fairly high.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Oklopdzic's car was slapped with a $30 citation for being
parked on a street during street-cleaning hours. Oklopdzic's excuse
was that he had a heart attack and was rushed to Seton Hospital for
quadruple-bypass surgery, making it difficult to move his car in
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``After investigating this protest,'' reads the letter Mike
received from the Department of Parking &AMP; Traffic, ``we have found
the following: there is no parking allowed during the posted street
cleaning hours. The citation is valid and your protest is denied.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd love to see some of the protests that are upheld by DPT.
</P>
<P>
   PIGGING OUT on Thanksgiving leftovers was not part of the
holiday festivities for many of the city's homeless. All the local
shelters served up wonderful Thanksgiving Day meals, then most of
them, especially the big ones, shut down for the long three-day
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   St. Anthony's bucked the trend and stayed open, scuffling to
handle the extra load of hungry folks, showing once again that when
it comes to doing what St. Anthony's does, nobody does it with more
heart.
</P>
<P>
   FUSION FOLLIES: Walt Giachini figures he discovered the ultimate
expression of fusion dining. The Hyatt at Incline Village, Nev.,
has a restaurant called the Ciao Mein Trattoria.
</P>
<P>
   Says Walt, ``It reminds me of the `Odd Couple' episode where
slob Oscar heats up two TV dinners, one Italian and one Chinese,
and slaps the two trays together.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Sacramento orthodontist Dr. Gloria Nollie,
father African American, mother Japanese. Dad's favorite dish is
chitlins teriyaki.
</P>
<P>
   HOLIRAGE: On a recent afternoon, a 26 Valencia bus stalls at
Chenery and Roanoke.
</P>
<P>
   The driver picks up her radio microphone to call the Muni yard
for help. Just then, an SUV pulls up next to the bus, the SUV
driver rolls down his window and screams at the Muni driver, ``Get
off the cell phone!''
</P>
<P>
   And on Fifth St. near Market, a bicyclist, perhaps annoyed by
the heavy holiday traffic of fossil-fuelers, swings his chain-lock
like a bolo and shatters the side-view mirror of a car. A pedal-by
chaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good thing that driver doesn't have a gun,'' my cabbie says.
``A whole lot of people in this town are carrying guns, you know, I
mean a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   So there's your holiday tip if you're looking for an
inexpensive, easy-to-find gift.

WTO, FOES FIND LITTLE COMMON GROUND IN SEATTLE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SEATTLE _ With protest swirling in the air blowing in off Puget
Sound, the World Trade Organization reached out hesitantly to its
many critics gathered here Monday _ and got a chilly response.
<P>
   The WTO held a carefully scripted conference with
nongovernmental organizations _ the think tanks and activist groups
that have lambasted the trade body as a corporate-dominated
oppressor of the world's poor. It was billed as a historic event,
the first time the WTO had opened itself to the grass roots.
</P>
<P>
   But the way the event was staged showed the global group's
extreme ambivalence toward the idea. Most of the panelists were
government officials and speakers apparently chosen because they
oppose shedding further light on the WTO's secretive ways.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few critics were allowed to the podium. The rest sat
steaming in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   WTO Director General Mike Moore set the tone by warning that
proposals to include labor rights and environmental protections in
the WTO's rules only hurt the interests of the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a contradiction among those who give generously at
church on Sunday when there is a flood or earthquake in the Third
World, then on Monday sign a petition to lock out the products
their workers create,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am told there could be up to 50,000 demonstrators against us
(today),'' Moore added. ``But remember: In over 30 countries, 1.5
billion want to join the WTO,'' he said, referring to the 30
nations, including China, that have WTO membership applications
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers took a tougher line. Britain's international
trade minister, Clare Short, said, ``A lot of the criticism is
seriously misplaced.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia University economist Jagdish Bagwati _ a prominent
pro-free-trade theoretician _ attacked the critics for what he
called ``a fear complex'' about the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization is a force for good, prosperity and equality,''
he said, adding that any suggestions otherwise are ``just
rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in the seats in the vast hall of the Washington State
Convention and Trade Center, Lori Wallach packed her briefcase and
headed out in a huff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either through hubris or ignorance, these guys think that by
lecturing to us and telling us, `You just don't understand,' over
and over again, that will shut us up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A Harvard-educated lawyer who is director of Public Citizen's
Global Trade Watch, a Washington-based think tank founded by
consumer advocate Ralph Nader, Wallach is one of the WTO's most
articulate and relentless critics.
</P>
<P>
   The few WTO critics who made it to the podium were more
deferential than Wallach, but their comments were pointed.
</P>
<P>
   Vwelinzima Vavi, a leader of the Congress of African Trade
Unions in South Africa, countered Moore by insisting that the trade
body adopt rules against labor and environmental abuse. Julian
Edwards, director of Consumers International, said the WTO's
current regulations discriminate against a wide variety of
consumer, health and safety laws in many nations.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's forum was held the day before the start of the WTO's
summit meeting, which is expected to open the way for a new series
of trade agreements on a great variety of economic subjects.
</P>
<P>
   But the WTO's rigid rules of secrecy _ for example, the closure
to the public of the proceedings of its powerful dispute panels _
have prompted widespread calls for increased openness.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has backed those calls belatedly and
was the prime mover in persuading Moore to hold Monday's meeting.
But many other governments oppose any participation by
nongovernmental groups, saying they are meddlesome and bring up
issues _ such as labor and the environment _ that are irrelevant to
poor nations' needs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, more than two-thirds of the approximately 750
``nongovernmental'' groups accredited to the WTO summit are
business lobby groups.
</P>
<P>
   The start of Monday's forum was delayed for more than four hours
because of an apparent attempted break-in overnight at the
convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Police SWAT teams worried about a possible bomb got help from
sniffing dogs as they searched the downtown building while hundreds
of delegates, journalists and activists waited outside.
</P>
<P>
   The incident came a day before tens of thousands of anti-trade
protesters plan to take to the streets to denounce the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club staged a noisy but peaceful march in downtown
Monday under the watchful eye of police in riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   Six arrests were reported after environmental protesters scaled
a giant construction crane in the downtown area to drape an
anti-WTO banner. The Rainforest Action Network claimed
responsibility for the action, saying in a statement that its
demonstrators had come to Seattle ``because the stakes are too high
for us to stay at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Protest leaders said Monday's activities were only a warm-up for
what is to come. The biggest event of the week will be mounted
separately Tuesday by the AFL-CIO, a march by workers and their
families that will coincide with the summit's opening sessions.

OPRAH WINFREY LAWSUIT SILENCES PUBLIC DEBATE ON FOOD PRODUCTS

 c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1996, Oprah Winfrey and her television guest, former rancher
Howard Lyman of the Humane Society, were sued by Texas cattle
barons for disparaging cattle. And freedom of speech was mugged.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey and Lyman, in light of England's ``mad cow disease'' and
possible links to a fatal degenerative brain disease in humans, had
questioned the feed practices of the cattle industry in the United
States on her TV program.
</P>
<P>
   Although Winfrey won convincingly in the lower federal court in
1998, the judge did not strike down the Texas food disparagement
law as unconstitutional. The law is still on the books. And still
being used to try to silence critics.
</P>
<P>
   The cattle ranchers appealed the lower court's decision to the
U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The appellate court will
render its decision soon. Nevertheless, the cattlemen's $10 million
lawsuit has already cost Winfrey over a million dollars to fight
it. Most citizens and many companies could not afford the risk of
such a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The cattlemen's lawsuit has sent waves of caution across the
nation. Who can afford to fight a food industry in a court of law?
</P>
<P>
   And that is the point. Stifle all discussion about food
processing, growth hormones and other chemicals used to produce
larger crops or fatter livestock, pesticides and herbicides,
genetically engineered foods, irradiating fruits and vegetables,
questionable practices in feeding livestock, slaughterhouse
techniques, pollution from hog farms.
</P>
<P>
   The list is formidable and important to our health.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen states now have food disparagement laws. And two other
states, California and Michigan, currently have bills pending in
their legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, states want to protect their farmers and
ranchers from losing business. They need consumers to trust their
products. But these food disparagement laws violate both the spirit
and the letter of the First Amendment _ worse, they stifle debate
on public health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural groups and producers advertise the safety and
quality of their foods in local and national media. They have every
right to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Having done so, however, means those groups and producers are
now ``public figures.'' And First Amendment principles that are
applied to them change and are more strict.
</P>
<P>
   Under settled First Amendment law, to recover damages in a libel
lawsuit, a public figure must first prove that the person who is
accused of libel has made a damaging public statement that is
factually false and did so knowing the statement was false, or with
reckless disregard for its truth or falsity.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions, like ``I hate broccoli,'' are protected under normal
First Amendment jurisprudence. No so in food libel laws.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, most of these food disparagement laws will be struck
down, but not before they have endangered the health and nutrition
of the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Even though only 13 states have these laws, they have an effect
nationally. A book on food published in New York might cause a
lawsuit to be filed in Idaho, which has a food disparagement law.
Oprah Winfrey's television program originates in Chicago, but she
was sued in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The April issue of the Nation reported that actor Alec Baldwin
approached numerous television channels and networks with a
proposal for a documentary entitled ``The History of Food'' and
that he was turned down. The Nation story quotes Baldwin: ``But all
of these outlets, they're like, `Oh, God! We can't do that, because
of that Oprah Winfrey beef lawsuit.' I mean this is what I'm
getting from the History Channel. They just say, `We'll call you.'
And I never hear from them.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Robert Hatherill is a research scientist and faculty member
of the Environmental Studies Program at the University of
California at Santa Barbara. He wrote a commentary piece for the
Los Angeles Times in April in which he describes his publisher
having ``stripped lengthy passages'' from his new book, ``Eat to
Beat Cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatherill wrote: ``I was not allowed to disclose dangers
inherent in some common foods like dairy and meat products, as well
as over-the-counter medicines like calcium supplements and
nonprescription pain remedies. The problem had nothing to do with
whether there was sufficient evidence to support the claims _ there
is _ it came down to fear of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told, `We could win the lawsuit, but it would cost us
millions, and it's just not worth it.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to try to protect the produce of your local
rancher and farmer with these food defamation laws, quite another
to end up protecting corporate giants like Monsanto Co. According
to a June 1, New York Times front-page story by Melody Petersen,
over a year ago, ``Vital Health Publishing of Bloomingdale, Ill.,
canceled a book, `Against the Grain: Biotechnology and the
Corporate Takeover of Your Food,' after the manuscript had been
sent to the printers. The publisher had received a letter from a
lawyer at Monsanto Co. who said he believed the manuscript, which
he had not seen, included false statements that would disparage a
herbicide called Roundup, made by Monsanto.''
</P>
<P>
   Toxicologist Marc Lappe, who co-authored the book, said the
manuscript had already been approved by the publisher's lawyer.
``But Monsanto's letter changed the lawyer's mind.'' Lappe and his
co-author, Britt Bailey, found another publisher, Common Courage
Press, which published the book last November. And, according to
the New York Times story, the new publisher has not heard a word
from Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly it was a bullying tactic made by a giant corporation
that has the resources to take anyone to court and bury them, even
if those they take to court eventually win.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association
threatened an environmental group in Vermont for distributing
reports questioning the health safety of irradiating fruits and
vegetables. In a letter from United's law firm, the group, Food and
Water, was told that nearly 30 states had passed or were
considering legislation that allowed lawsuits against anyone who
disseminated false statements against agricultural products. The
letter ended, ``We must advise you that Food and Water's actions
will be closely scrutinized.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the final verdict in the Oprah Winfrey lawsuit, the
damage has been done to public discourse about issues concerning
food, diet, health and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   The few illustrations of how public debate on these issues was
smothered shows only the surface of the problem. It reaches
ordinary individuals who educated themselves on these issues in
order to speak out in concern for public health. Many have been
silenced.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas beef barons have crammed their bull manure into the
mouths of legitimate public debate.

   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ Great-Aunt Octavia was rarely mentioned around
my grandmother Parker's home in Jacksonville, and when she was it
was in hushed tones. Auntie lived in Savannah, you know.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of such secretive carryings on, I spent an
inordinate amount of my childhood Lurking in shadowy halls or
crouched behind the furniture in a desperate attempt to overhear
something, anything, that would clear up the mystery that was
Savannah. But the grownups were too clever for me. Any time Aunt
'Tave's name was mentioned, voices dropped and dainty hands
fluttered up to hide the latest scurrilous news from the low
country.
</P>
<P>
   Things weren't much different across town in my Grandmother
Nichols' parlor. Early on, I learned there were but two basic
themes of conversation in my family, with a few variations thrown
in from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Theme one always sounded at dinner when someone felt obliged to
point out how beautiful the table would have been if the Yankees
hadn't stolen Great-great-grandmother Coolidge's silver. Theme two:
What a shame it was that (SET ITAL) certain (END ITAL) branches of
the family had opted to move to Savannah where, according to my
childish comprehension, the streets were lined with fallen women.
Once I even heard mention of a great-grandmother (married) who had
a gentleman friend (also married) in the tobacco business up in
North Carolina. He sent her postcards.
</P>
<P>
   As a curious kid, I was forever asking questions that appeared
to embarrass my elders like: When can we go visit Aunt 'Tave?
(Never!) or tell me about Great-grandmother Holmes-Owen (Who?). One
grandmother or another would remind me that (SET ITAL) our (END
ITAL) branch of the family did (SET ITAL) not (END ITAL) visit
Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, as soon as I was old enough to travel on my own
(about 44), I lit out for Savannah as fast as my old brown station
wagon would carry me, determined to dig up an ancestor or two, and
maybe learn for myself the cause of all the eyebrow raising and
hand wringing I'd witnessed in those formative years.
</P>
<P>
   I was prepared for the worst, fully expecting to find a memorial
plaque nailed to a Dilapidated and long defunct house of ill repute
dedicated to my Aunt 'Tave, or maybe some archival mention of that
scarlet woman who was my great-grandmother. But it didn't happen. I
found no evidence that any of my forbearers might have been the
inspiration for that 1924 hit, ``Hard-Hearted Hannah (The Vamp of
Savannah)''.
</P>
<P>
   What I did find there was enchantment _ in the buildings, the
people, and Even in the Spanish moss so carelessly draped over the
trees in Bonaventure Cemetery where my search for roots had led me.
Odd place to look for a life _ in a cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I was back in town, visiting with a friend whose
family history (on his mother's side) is literally laid in the
cornerstones of Savannah's historic district. We walked the brick
streets, pausing now and then to absorb the mysterious beauty that
is this city. The only thing that distinguished us from the other
out-of-towners was our conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent summers in that house with my mother,'' my companion
explained, pointing to a vine-covered brick place behind a fancy
iron fence on East Jones Street. I took his picture sitting on the
steps. He pointed to the house next door and told me his aunt had
lived there. The two sisters, unlike my Jacksonville family, were
very close.
</P>
<P>
   That made me wonder even more about the Savannah ladies hanging
from my family tree. What had caused them to move away?
</P>
<P>
   So far my only clue is something I saw on the front of a T-shirt
down on Bull Street. ``In Atlanta,'' it read, ``the first question
people ask you is, 'What's your business?' In Macon they ask,
'Where do you go to church?' In Augusta, 'What's your grandmother's
maiden name?' But in Savannah we ask, 'What would you like to
drink?' ``
</P>
<P>
   So maybe that's it _ maybe the ladies had to move to Savannah to
get a drink.

 &HT;    Pay attention: Adults may also have ADHD
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As an adult looking back on a life lived
at high speed, Ronald Furman describes himself as always wanting to
leap off the edge.
</P>
<P>
   A hustler, a risk-taker, a danger-seeker.
</P>
<P>
   The 53 year old, who recently moved to North Palm Beach, was
married three times _ twice to the same woman _ took five years to
get through high school, drank excessively, craved high speeds,
and, in short, sought anything that would make him ``high.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, his life of dares and uncontrolled behavior landed
him in jail for a year for cocaine possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted anything that would deliver stimulation to me,'' he
said. ``I was self-medicating and I didn't know it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Furman was treating himself for, he found out, was a
psychiatric condition most often associated with children _
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ADHD has only within the last few years been recognized as a
legitimate adult diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were trained that people outgrew ADHD,'' said
Dr. Russell Barkley, director of psychology and professor of
psychiatry and neurology at the University of Massachusetts Medical
School.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know that's not true. Somewhere between 15-20 percent
may outgrow it, but 65-75 percent continue to have symptoms that
impair them markedly as adults.''
</P>
<P>
   ADHD is a neurological and genetic disorder that, Barkley said,
is the most widely inherited trait of any psychiatric disorder.
Estimates are that 2 million to 5 million adults have ADHD.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost impossible to acquire the syndrome in adulthood,
except through trauma to the head. Most cases of adult diagnosis
occur in those whose childhood disorder was not identified. And
Barkley believes that the majority of adults with it ``remain
undiagnosed at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   He is studying 240 adults to try to better define the symptoms
and the way they affect an adult.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding signs are impulsivity and inattentiveness, and
lack of inhibition and self-control. This can translate into
multiple marriages, substance abuse, speeding violations and risky
driving, poor job histories, difficulties in school and criminal
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Furman is almost a textbook example.
</P>
<P>
   But diagnosis is difficult, said psychologist Myles Cooley, who
is treating the North Palm Beach man.
</P>
<P>
   He says it is absolutely essential that a history of such
behavior date back to early childhood for a diagnosis to be on
target.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can't find any evidence through high school or college,
I'm going to really question what's going on here,'' he said.
Because of the difficulties in getting details from ADHD patients,
he said, he often questions spouses and parents, or even goes as
far as asking for report cards if they're available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cards are likely to have notations from teachers about the
child speaking out in class or being disruptive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Furman said he began to question himself when he spent some time
living with his mother and heard stories about his hell-raising as
a child. When a friend with a similar history was diagnosed, he
said it prodded his interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize how debilitating it is. I want to be a
stable individual, hold a job for a long period of time. The
longest I've ever been employed is a year and a half,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is currently being evaluated for medication. Drugs such as
Ritalin, a stimulant, or antidepressants may be prescribed for
adults, as they are sometimes for children. Patients are also
trained to control their behaviors and focus better on tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like somebody took a large backpack filled with rocks
off my back,'' Furman said of his diagnosis. ``If someone else out
there feels the same as I do, I'd like to have them realize they
can still get help.''
</P>

Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD) at (800) 233-4050 or visit

 &HT;    AIDS in the family: Even the healthy hurt
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This fall, Dylan Edwards discovered something he was
really good at, something he loved, something he could be proud of,
something that suddenly made school worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   This talent gave him a distinct identity, entirely separate from
that of his little brother, in whose shadow he had lived for most
of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Dylan, 15, debuted on the eighth-grade football
team at McNair Middle School in Decatur, Ga. He eventually helped
his team win the area championship.
</P>
<P>
   But he learned not to scan the bleachers for the faces he most
wanted to see.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Tisa, came to the first game to cheer him on, and
was even elected an officer of the team's booster club. She never
made it to another game.
</P>
<P>
   For the next month she sat by her younger son's hospital bedside
in intensive care. She came home only to drive Dylan to school in
the mornings. He went to the hospital in the afternoons, after
football practice.
</P>
<P>
   Together they watched Dylan's brother, Chris, lose his last
battle with AIDS. And they tried not to think whether Tisa would
someday be in the hospital bed, comatose and alive only through
machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan is the only member of his immediate family not infected
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. But he is no less a victim of
the disease. The virus has consumed his life, and infected him with
a profound anger that sometimes shows.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Bruce, died of AIDS in 1992. Tisa, 35, is
HIV-positive but has remained healthy, aside from a serious bout
with shingles several years ago. Until Chris died six weeks ago,
three days before his 13th birthday, the family revolved around his
illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's always been about Chris,'' Tisa said
matter-of-factly, but with deep regret. ``Dylan's life has always
been put on the back burner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I have lost so much time, it's unreal. Every time we
would plan something, Chris would get sick, or he'd have to go to
the doctor, or he'd do something stupid and get hurt and we'd end
up in the emergency room anyway,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She relied upon Dylan to understand why things were the way they
were. He never complained. ``I'm sure he's been jealous of Chris in
the past,'' Tisa said. ``But he's always been very understanding.
He's never been a selfish kid.''
</P>
<P>
   But a child can be understanding and unselfish and still suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For children with AIDS, there are some resources,'' said Neil
Willenson, the founder and president of Camp Heartland, a Minnesota
charity organization for HIV-positive children and their siblings.
Both Dylan and Chris attended the camp for years. ``There are
social workers, medical professionals, organizations that look
after their needs. But often the siblings are left to fend for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Children still dying
</P>
<P>
   When Chris tested positive for HIV, there was only one AIDS
drug, AZT, and his doctors predicted he would survive a year,
perhaps two at most.
</P>
<P>
   In celebrating birthdays in the double digits, he outlived many
children with AIDS. The median survival time for children infected
with HIV from birth is about 8 or 9 years.
</P>
<P>
   New drugs have greatly improved the length and quality of life
for all people with HIV, but the drugs are no cure. In Chris' case,
his early treatment with AZT may have narrowed his later treatment
options. Doctors now know that a combination of three or more drugs
is the most effective treatment for HIV. Using a single drug can
lead quickly to drug resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Because Chris had generally enjoyed good health, his death was a
shock to many, including Willenson, who flew to Atlanta during
Chris' last few days. Chris was the fifth Camp Heartland child to
die in the past five months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost more children this year than any other,'' Willenson
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, designated World AIDS Day, the United Nations, the
World Health Organization and UNICEF will issue a joint report on
children orphaned by AIDS throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more and more families where one child may be
negative and everyone else may have HIV,'' Willenson said. ``We
have thousands of survivors who are not infected by HIV but are
horribly affected by it. We have to give them support.''
</P>
<P>
   Family time lost
</P>
<P>
   In November 1987, shortly after Chris was diagnosed, Tisa took
him to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., where he
became one of the first children in pediatric AIDS clinical
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Tisa and Chris were gone for three weeks. Dylan was 3 years old.
It was the first of many, many absences. Tisa and Chris had to
travel to NIH every month, and the family couldn't afford for Dylan
to go, so he stayed home with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Tisa was careful not to make a big deal out of Chris' infected
status, and treated his medical care as a fact of life.
</P>
<P>
   Then Chris had an accident. The boys, 4 and 6 years old at the
time, were at a Burger King playground when Chris fell and tore
open stitches in his chin from a previous mishap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look out, and Dylan is holding Chris' chin,'' Tisa
remembered. ``And Dylan's got blood in the palm of his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Dylan had come in contact with his
brother's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Tisa panicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I yelled, `Go wash your hands! And don't come out until you've
washed them for 10 minutes!' And Dylan freaked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Dylan swallowed his resentment when birthdays or
holidays or special occasions were overlooked because of Chris.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very common feeling of siblings of children with
AIDS,'' said Willenson. About 70 percent of the 400 kids who attend
Camp Heartland every year are the HIV-negative brothers and sisters
of children with HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel guilty for being healthy. But they also feel
jealous, because their parents have to spend any free moments with
the child with the virus,'' Willenson said. ``And then they feel
guilty for feeling jealous.''
</P>
<P>
   But the story of Chris and Dylan is not the story of Jacob and
Esau, the Old Testament brothers who competed bitterly for their
father's favor. Dylan and Chris fought like brothers, but they
loved each other. One summer, Chris wasn't allowed to go to Camp
Heartland because he had been fighting with other kids. Dylan
refused to go without his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Kopple, an Academy Award-winning filmmaker, met Dylan
and Chris last year while she was directing and co-producing a
documentary on children with HIV and AIDS. She was so struck by the
intense bond between Dylan and Chris that she prominently featured
them in the film. (It will air again Wednesday, at 7 p.m. and 9:05
p.m. on the Disney Channel.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt there was such a link and sensibility between them,''
Kopple said. ``Dylan really gave Chris so many allowances, because
he didn't know how long his brother might be with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling taunts at school
</P>
<P>
   When Dylan smiles, which is rarely, he is a handsome boy.
Relatives say he resembles his father.
</P>
<P>
   He is bright, and speaks with clear diction and a sophisticated
vocabulary unusual for a 15-year-old. But he does poorly in school.
He had to repeat seventh grade, and this school year his low grades
kept him from going out for the basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've missed homework and tests for about two months, I was at
the hospital so much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His penchant for smarting off to teachers and his tendency to
fight with classmates have earned him school suspensions and a
spotty disciplinary record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate school,'' he said frankly. ``I don't like the classes,
I don't like the teachers, I don't like the people. I don't like
anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst trouble Dylan ever got into was over his family. A
couple of years ago at another middle school, a boy began taunting
Dylan for having a mother and brother with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   One day at lunch, the boy slammed a bottle on the cafeteria
table in front of Dylan and said, ``Give that to your mother and
brother, it's a cure for AIDS.'' The bottle was filled with water.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan eventually was kicked out of that school for fighting with
his tormentor, who wasn't disciplined. Tisa's voice shakes with
fury when she tells the story.
</P>
<P>
   But Dylan's essentially a good kid, the sort who does nice
things for his mom but doesn't necessarily want the neighborhood to
hear about it. He's close to his uncle, Tisa's brother, and spends
much of his free time with him.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't get into trouble outside school. He says ``please''
and ``thank you'' and does his chores without being asked. He'd
like to go to college someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to get my grades up,'' he said decidedly. ``I'm going
to go around and ask all of my teachers for all of the work I
missed, and I'm going to finish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Ireland, one of Dylan's football coaches at McNair, says
he has the ``utmost respect'' for Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was really courageous,'' Ireland said. ``He kept
a whole lot inside of him. But he seemed to love football, and he
did what the coaches asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When his brother died, we asked him if he wanted time off. We
had a game coming up. He said, no, he wanted to play,'' Ireland
said. ``And he did an outstanding job.''
</P>
<P>
   Tisa attributes some of Dylan's anger to Bruce, who infected her
with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very angry at his father,'' Tisa said. ``He knows Bruce
did this to us. He knows that it's Bruce's fault that Chris died,
it's Bruce's fault that I could die, and it's Bruce's fault that he
will be the only one to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1987, as Tisa was doing the laundry, she found a
receipt from a clinic that treats sexually transmitted diseases in
a pocket of Bruce's jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `When were you going to tell me about this?''' Tisa
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   She tested positive for HIV. Neither Dylan, who was 2 at the
time, nor Chris, 6 months old, was tested. ``Back then, they didn't
think to check children,'' Tisa said.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Chris developed a severe infection on the
skin lining the inside of his cheek. It looked as though someone
had cut a golf ball in half and stuck it inside the infant's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Tests showed Chris was infected. Dylan was pronounced HIV-free.
</P>
<P>
   Tisa doesn't know how Bruce was infected. But she is sure that
he infected her, and that she gave the virus to Chris while she was
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the circumstances, there is little bitterness in
Tisa's voice when she speaks of Bruce. But Dylan won't even talk
about his dad. It's hard enough for him to talk about Chris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best not to,'' he muttered.
</P>
<P>
   The day they had feared
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Chris started to cough. Terrible, heaving
coughs that sometimes made him vomit.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had been officially diagnosed with full-blown AIDS
since age 3, Chris had spent many years in good health, with only
occasional ear or sinus infections.
</P>
<P>
   This cough wouldn't go away, and Chris developed a fever and
body aches.
</P>
<P>
   At last, his doctors produced a diagnosis: whooping cough, an
illness that usually strikes babies.
</P>
<P>
   The whooping cough further undermined Chris' HIV-weakened immune
system. Other infections, including (BEGIN ITALIC) Pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia, (END ITALIC) seized the opportunity to attack
his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Because his lungs couldn't draw enough oxygen, Chris was placed
on a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dylan saw him on the ventilator, I think he understood
for the first time that Chris could die,'' Willenson said. ``And
Dylan clearly was not ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 12, Chris died.
</P>
<P>
   ``His body just couldn't handle it,'' Tisa said. ``He was tired,
and he wanted to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Tisa and Dylan used Chris' ashes to plant a
tree in his memory at Camp Heartland. At the service, for the first
time, Dylan wept.
</P>
<P>
   A lot to get over
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to spend a lot more time with Dylan now, but he's
15, and spending time with Mom is not a cool thing,'' Tisa says
with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was it you were going to do this weekend?'' she asks
Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roller-skating,'' he replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Wait, I'll go with you.' And he said, `Mom, people
don't take their parents skating.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dylan rolls his eyes in that teenage way that translates as,
Duh! Tisa laughs and musses his carefully groomed hair.
</P>
<P>
   She knows she can't make up for the years spent dealing with his
brother's disease, and she can't promise him she'll live forever.
But she hopes she can at least help him heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smile, Dylan,'' she coaxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like smiling,'' he retorts through a tightly set
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smile anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   His face twitches, and he struggles with it for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like smiling,'' he repeats, but this time he is
grinning.

 &HT;    AIDS in the family: Even the healthy hurt
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This fall, Dylan Edwards discovered something he was
really good at, something he loved, something he could be proud of,
something that suddenly made school worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   This talent gave him a distinct identity, entirely separate from
that of his little brother, in whose shadow he had lived for most
of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Dylan, 15, debuted on the eighth-grade football
team at McNair Middle School in Decatur, Ga. He eventually helped
his team win the area championship.
</P>
<P>
   But he learned not to scan the bleachers for the faces he most
wanted to see.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Tisa, came to the first game to cheer him on, and
was even elected an officer of the team's booster club. She never
made it to another game.
</P>
<P>
   For the next month she sat by her younger son's hospital bedside
in intensive care. She came home only to drive Dylan to school in
the mornings. He went to the hospital in the afternoons, after
football practice.
</P>
<P>
   Together they watched Dylan's brother, Chris, lose his last
battle with AIDS. And they tried not to think whether Tisa would
someday be in the hospital bed, comatose and alive only through
machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan is the only member of his immediate family not infected
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. But he is no less a victim of
the disease. The virus has consumed his life, and infected him with
a profound anger that sometimes shows.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Bruce, died of AIDS in 1992. Tisa, 35, is
HIV-positive but has remained healthy, aside from a serious bout
with shingles several years ago. Until Chris died six weeks ago,
three days before his 13th birthday, the family revolved around his
illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's always been about Chris,'' Tisa said
matter-of-factly, but with deep regret. ``Dylan's life has always
been put on the back burner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I have lost so much time, it's unreal. Every time we
would plan something, Chris would get sick, or he'd have to go to
the doctor, or he'd do something stupid and get hurt and we'd end
up in the emergency room anyway,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She relied upon Dylan to understand why things were the way they
were. He never complained. ``I'm sure he's been jealous of Chris in
the past,'' Tisa said. ``But he's always been very understanding.
He's never been a selfish kid.''
</P>
<P>
   But a child can be understanding and unselfish and still suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For children with AIDS, there are some resources,'' said Neil
Willenson, the founder and president of Camp Heartland, a Minnesota
charity organization for HIV-positive children and their siblings.
Both Dylan and Chris attended the camp for years. ``There are
social workers, medical professionals, organizations that look
after their needs. But often the siblings are left to fend for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Children still dying
</P>
<P>
   When Chris tested positive for HIV, there was only one AIDS
drug, AZT, and his doctors predicted he would survive a year,
perhaps two at most.
</P>
<P>
   In celebrating birthdays in the double digits, he outlived many
children with AIDS. The median survival time for children infected
with HIV from birth is about 8 or 9 years.
</P>
<P>
   New drugs have greatly improved the length and quality of life
for all people with HIV, but the drugs are no cure. In Chris' case,
his early treatment with AZT may have narrowed his later treatment
options. Doctors now know that a combination of three or more drugs
is the most effective treatment for HIV. Using a single drug can
lead quickly to drug resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Because Chris had generally enjoyed good health, his death was a
shock to many, including Willenson, who flew to Atlanta during
Chris' last few days. Chris was the fifth Camp Heartland child to
die in the past five months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost more children this year than any other,'' Willenson
said.

World Health Organization and UNICEF will issue a joint report on

</P>
<P>
   A lot to get over
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to spend a lot more time with Dylan now, but he's
15, and spending time with Mom is not a cool thing,'' Tisa says
with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was it you were going to do this weekend?'' she asks
Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roller-skating,'' he replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Wait, I'll go with you.' And he said, `Mom, people
don't take their parents skating.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dylan rolls his eyes in that teenage way that translates as,
Duh! Tisa laughs and musses his carefully groomed hair.
</P>
<P>
   She knows she can't make up for the years spent dealing with his
brother's disease, and she can't promise him she'll live forever.
But she hopes she can at least help him heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smile, Dylan,'' she coaxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like smiling,'' he retorts through a tightly set
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smile anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   His face twitches, and he struggles with it for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like smiling,'' he repeats, but this time he is
grinning.

 &HT;    Is the workplace going to the dogs?
 &HT;    By Pamela LeBlanc
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If she's not sacked out on a desk somewhere or
sprinting up the stairs after an office mate, look for Scarlett
begging a bit of barbecue from a co-worker who's just come back
from the restaurant down the street.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be what you'd consider proper office etiquette, but
as long as she's not piddling on the carpet or barging uninvited
into staff meetings, Scarlett and others like her are welcome at a
growing number of Austin companies that allow employees to bring
dogs to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogs are part of our creative team,'' said Gay Gaddis, founder
and president of T3 (The Think Tank), an ad agency whose clients
include Dell Computer Corp. and Central Market.
</P>
<P>
   The trend apparently got its start in California's Silicon
Valley, where some high-tech companies started permitting pets in
the late 1980s. Today, dogs are finding their way into the
corporate world in laid-back Austin, sharing swivel chairs with
their owners, cruising the hallways or taking a quick romp
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Doggie gates have gone up at Garden.com, Shetland sheepdogs keep
employees happy and stress levels low at MQ and C Advertising, and
computer company 3dfx recently pitched its dog-friendly environment
in a radio recruitment campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just lightens the mood,'' said Laura Nell Soules,
Scarlett's owner and public relations director for T3 (The Think
Tank), which is housed in a 1912-era building on Rio Grande Street.
``It fits in with the culture of who we are, and I think it's
visual evidence that we love what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarlett, dubbed Scarlett O'Hairy by the T3 staff, likes to
while away her days lounging on Soules' desk or making the office
rounds, greeting co-workers who obviously adore her. They rumple
her fluffy fur or scoop her into their arms for a quick snuggle.
</P>
<P>
   Gaddis began permitting dogs about the time she instituted the
company's T3 and Under program, which allows new mothers to bring
their babies to work. On any given day, all or part of her personal
canine crew _ Bonnie, Bill, Joe David and Nolan Ryan _ can be found
scrambling over the marble table or settling in on the couch in her
office.
</P>
<P>
   Gaddis believes that having pets and babies around helps her
employees de-stress and promotes creative thinking. It also has
helped her retain good employees over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a business of creative ideas,'' Gaddis said. ``A
break with an animal or human touch with children relaxes people
and opens minds. When you feel good about where you are, the ideas
come.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a theory backed by the American Pet Products Manufacturers
Association, a Conn-
</P>
<P>
   ecticut-based national trade group that surveyed 50 companies,
small and large, across the country, that allow pets in the
workplace. The association's study of law firms, Internet sales
companies and retail shops showed that those with pets had lower
absenteeism rates and employees who were more willing to work
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``People work long hours today and are stressed out _ it's the
perfect way to be more productive at work,'' said Funda Alp,
spokeswoman for the association. ``You're more relaxed because your
loved one is there with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The only requirements at T3? Pets must be healthy, flea-free and
able to demonstrate a reasonable amount of decorum, and they can't
interrupt meetings. That's not to say you won't hear the occasional
intercom page for a pet that's wandered out of the room, or a yap
here and there.
</P>
<P>
   But even the clients don't seem to mind. ``They tend to think
it's kind of charming,'' said T3 employee Jennifer Ramsey, whose
chocolate Lab Reba joins her at work several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the offices that do allow pets are small, upstart
companies with young employes and a creative bent like advertising,
or high-tech firms competing for job applicants and using
dog-at-work privileges to lure in new hires.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Employees strolling the hallways with their dogs,
heading to the water cooler to fill up water bowl-- , or
congregating on the patch of grass outside while their dogs do
their business.
</P>
<P>
   But pets just don't work at every office. Although BMC Software
never officially allowed pets, a few of the company's 600 Austin
employees occasionally brought in their dogs, said facilities
manager Ruth Ann Cansler. That changed after a few pups didn't make
it outside for their bathroom break-- and office management was
left holding the pooper scooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to bring them in and didn't clean up after them,''
Cansler said. ``I've cleaned it up before and the vice president of
the company has had to clean it up.''
</P>
<P>
   But at MQ and C Advertising, a small Austin advertising company,
owner Ben Morris believes that if it makes employees happy to have
their pets with them, it's worth it. ``I think this is very much in
touch with getting your work done and letting employees be adults
and manage their time and workload so they can have a positive work
environment,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   Across town at Garden.com, which has almost 200 employees, 15 to
20 dogs show up on a typical day. The crew includes Mr. Cracker the
greyhound, Bruno the boxer, Maggie the Labrador, Yobo the cocker
spaniel, and April, the 8-pound Italian greyhound, who sometimes
wears a sweater and always wears a heart-shaped chain that says
``Spoiled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' said Sabrina Wallace, who paused to offer a
Saltine cracker to Tango, her 95-pound yellow Lab. ``Dogs give you
that smile you need sometimes. If I'm all stressed out, I'll come
back to my cubicle ... It feels like working at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has allowed dogs since it opened in December 1995.
Even its Web site, www.garden.com, features a photo gallery of dogs
that frequent the office. Boxes of dog biscuits, Four Paws cologne
and cushioned pet beds share space with computer equipment and
reference manuals in employee cubicles.
</P>
<P>
   The pet-friendly policy got started because founders of the
company, a leading online source for gardening products and
services, all had animals that they didn't want to leave at home
when they came to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it takes an edge off the work environment,'' said
co-founder Jamie O'Neill, whose golden retriever Jackson whiled
away a recent morning gnawing on a yogurt container beneath
O'Neill's desk. ``They have a soothing effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's ``three barks and you're out'' policy prohibits
incessant barking and stipulates that the pets be well behaved
while on the job. For most, that's not a problem. As for the
workers, they've just got to worry about rolling over the stray dog
ear with their rolling chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few rules gathered from companies that allow dogs in
the workplace:
</P>
<P>
   _ No excessive barking, sometimes referred to as the ``three
barks and you're out'' rule. At Garden.com, for example, a dog is
out after three mishaps, be it noise or potty violations. The pup
must prove it can behave before it's allowed back at the office.
</P>
<P>
   _ No doggy interruptions of staff or client meetings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dogs should be confined to a cubicle or an office.
</P>
<P>
   _ No messing on the floor, and if a mistake should occur, the
owner should clean it up immediately.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dogs shouldn't disrupt business with clients, and if clients
are bothered by dogs, the owners should keep them out of the area.

 &HT;    Handbook aids gardening by the salty sea
 &HT;    By Heather Graulich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ On its surface, Gardens By The Sea,
written and published by the Garden Club of Palm Beach, would seem
to have a fairly limited audience.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction, written by local horticulturist Gene Joyner,
calls it ``an in-depth how-to book on the trials and successes of
gardening on oceanfront and near oceanfront property.''
</P>
<P>
   A chapter in the book titled ``Designing a Seaside Garden''
notes that ``assuming there will be a section of beach along your
shoreline, consideration must be given to plant material that can
hold the sand in place.''
</P>
<P>
   We should all have such problems.
</P>
<P>
   But before dismissing the book in favor of one titled Gardens By
The Retention Pond, take a closer look. Most of the book provides
good information for almost anyone gardening in balmy, breezy
locales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we're gearing the book toward anyone who lives
within 10 miles of the sea in a tropical climate, and not just in
South Florida,'' says Meredith Newton, spokeswoman for the Garden
Club, one of tony Palm Beach's oldest organizations. ``There are
unique challenges faced by anyone who gardens within 10 miles of
the coast, because of the salt air, the humidity and the soil being
based on sand.''
</P>
<P>
   The book largely is the brainchild and labor of two past
presidents of the Garden Club, Bess Summers and Joan Willmott, who
felt there had never been a good book written about coastal,
tropical gardening, Newton says.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the money factor. Proceeds from sales of the book
will go to the club to help pay for beautification projects around
Palm Beach and programs at the Pine Jog Environmental Center, a
learning facility for elementary school students in western Palm
Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   A history of the mansions
</P>
<P>
   Gardens By The Sea opens with a history of Palm Beach's mansions
and their well-landscaped grounds that includes some of the town's
quirky details _ such as the story of how Paris Singer,
illegitimate son of the sewing machine magnate, teamed up with
``rogue and con man'' Addison Mizner to build some of the island's
most beautiful estates. This section features historic photographs
found in the Garden Club's archives just last year.
</P>
<P>
   It's followed by the ``Designing a Seaside Garden'' section, the
only poorly executed part of the book. A small sketch is used to
show the floor plan and surrounding garden of a fictitious
oceanfront home. Then, two full pages of text try to describe for
the reader what kinds of plants to use in the garden and where to
put them. There are no pictures, and the sketch is not a detailed
landscape plan, offering only a few plant names and locations to
help the reader. The text itself is complicated, especially for
anyone with limited plant knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   But the bulk of the book is divided up into easy-to-follow
sections covering many of tropical gardening's most important
plants: palms, shrubs, flowering trees, fruit _ plus some of the
popular exotics such as orchids and gingers. There are other
sections, too, including those on herb and rose growing.
</P>
<P>
   Lush photographs, mostly taken in and around Palm Beach, accent
each section and make plant identification easier.
</P>
<P>
   Two editions available
</P>
<P>
   There are two editions of Gardens By The Sea; a ``deluxe''
version available through the Garden Club sells for $45 and is
printed on higher quality paper with a linen cover and includes an
additional chapter on Garden Club history. The less fancy ``trade''
edition is in bookstores for $34.95, but the Garden Club hopes to
sell more of the deluxe editions, of which they keep a bigger chunk
of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   And while anyone enjoying a coastal garden can benefit from the
book, those lucky enough to afford oceanfront property will find it
helpful, too, Newton says.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the people who live in Palm Beach,'' she explains,
``need to know what to tell their gardeners to do.''

 &HT;    'Tis the season for holiday music
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanksgiving is over. You know what that means (besides
leftovers). Time to start hauling out the holiday CDs. Every person
on Earth with access to a recording studio has made a holiday
album. And every year, we get inundated with a fresh batch.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they have ranged from folkie Jewel to popsters 98
Degrees to South Park's Mr. Hankey (really). Instead of wading
through all the new stuff, we asked some Palm Beach Post staff
writers to pick the discs _ those special evergreens _ they listen
to every year. Some you've heard, some you probably haven't.
</P>
<P>
   Happy start-of-the-holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Making Spirits Bright, Dean Martin (Capitol). When I was a kid,
my grandmother and her sisters owned a hotel and lounge in St.
Petersburg Beach. My grandmother was Italian, so one of the staples
on the jukebox during the holidays was Dean Martin. My favorite was
Rudolph, The Red Nosed Reindeer. This song always cracked me up
because Dean-o's obviously been hitting the eggnog hard in the
studio. In his best throaty cocktail voice, he trims his words and
improvises wildly. Christmas becomes Crizzmizz. Rudolph becomes
Rudy the Red Beaked Reindeer. At one point, he breaks into a German
accent and sings, ``Rudoph mit your nose so bright, won't you guide
mein sleigh tonight?'' It always reminds me of my grandmother at
the holiday party, a short glass of Baccardi and Coke in one hand,
cigarette in the other, singing along in a raspy voice, doing a
cha-cha around the bar with a huge smile. _ Jeff Houck
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson 5 Christmas Album (Motown). The Christmas season
doesn't really start for me until I start playing The Jackson 5
Christmas Album. This 1970 treasure takes me back to the days when
Michael was actually cute. Like Michael, I was a young kid who
could hit all those high notes on ``I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa
Claus'' and, my personal favorite, ``Santa Claus Is Comin' To
Town''. Jermaine Jackson did Nat King Cole proud with his soulful
rendition of ``The Christmas Song''.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the velvet-voiced Cole, his album, ``The Christmas
Song,'' is another classic around our house. When Cole croons O
Tannenbaum in German, you don't have to understand the language to
feel the soothing comfort of his lyrics. For jazz lovers, it's hard
to top Vince Guaraldi's wonderfully moving Christmas Time Is Here
on A Charlie Brown Christmas. Of the more recent holiday CDs, BeBe
&AMP; CeCe Winans' First Christmas is a gem _ their stirring,
gospel-filled version of The First Noel can make even hard-core
atheists convert _ and Luther Vandross' This is Christmas is one of
the best ways to get your partner in a cozy, late-night holiday
mood. _ Kevin D. Thompson
</P>
<P>
   Chanukah Songs, Cantor Larry Eschler. While there are no
shortage of Hanukkah albums, this cassette has always jumped to the
top of the playlist in our house. Part of the reason is personal:
We're members of Eschler's synagogue, Temple Beth David in Palm
Beach Gardens, Fla. But another part is simply the infectious folk
spirit Eschler brings to these holiday classics, including ``Maoz
Tzur'' and ``I Have a Little Dreidle.'' Eschler also sings one of
his own Hanukkah compositions, as well as a couple by contemporary
folk songwriter Debbie Friedman (you'll love ``I'm a Latke''). And
his renditions of the Hanukkah candle blessings are simple yet
inspiring. Available through Temple Beth David, Palm Beach Gardens.
_ Charles Passy
</P>
<P>
   A Broadway Christmas (Varese Sarabande). Perhaps in hopes of
getting independent holiday season airplay, lots of Broadway
musicals sneak Christmas-related songs into their plots. Fifteen
mostly merry examples have been compiled in ``A Broadway
Christmas,'' which I dig out and play annually. Some selections are
obvious, like Mame's ``We Need A Little Christmas'' sung buoyantly
by Lynnette Perry and ``Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,''
from ``Meet Me in St. Louis,'' delivered with velvety sincerity by
Liz Callaway. Dipping a little deeper into the holiday bag yields a
little known song called ``Christmas Eve,'' meant for ``She Loves
Me,'' and a rare downbeat Irving Berlin number, ``The Happy New
Year Blues'' from ``The Music Box Revue.'' Even the disc's cover
art of the Chorus Line logo figures in Santa suits is enough to get
theater fans in a holiday mood. _ Hap Erstein
</P>
<P>
   In the Spirit, Jessye Norman, with the American Boychoir, St.
Thomas Choir of Men and Boys, Riverside Choir, St. Barnabas Choir
and the Orchestra of St. Luke's, conducted by David Robertson.
(Philips Classics). Christmas is my favorite season for music, and
it's always a treat to hear the unexpected. Norman scales her
magnificent soprano down for a searingly beautiful collection of
Christmas tunes that ranges from the hymn ``Angels from the Realms
of Glory'' to the spiritual ``Mary had a Baby,'' and classical
pieces such as Schubert's ``Ave Maria.'' Much of the CD is a
cappella, with magical interplay between Norman and the choirs.
John McCutcheon's ``Winter Solstice'' (Rounder) is another
favorite. McCutcheon, master of the hammer dulcimer, plays and
sings classic and contemporary Christmas and Hanukkah tunes in this
1985 recording. International fare is what makes Christmas with
``Nana Mouskouri ``(Philips) special. The Greek songstress' albums
range from the schlocky to the sublime, but she finds perfect form
in this 1972 collection of English, French and Greek holiday fare.
``Her Minuit Cretiens'' (Holy Night) is ethereal. Noel, Joan Baez's
1966 album for Vanguard, teams the queen of folk with Peter
Schickele (P.D.Q. Bach himself) for a heavenly collection of
English, American, French and German Christmas songs. Be sure to
check out ``Down in Yon Forest.'' _ Scott Simmons
</P>
<P>
   A Christmas Gift for You, Phil Spector and various artists.
(Uni/Abkco) There are many holiday CDs I like and happily recommend
_ Harry Belafonte, Barbra Streisand, The Beach Boys, Nat King Cole,
George Winston, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley _ but this is the only
one I play when it's not Christmas. Phil Spector's grandiose
productions, from ``Da Doo Ron Ron'' to ``Be My Baby'' to ``You've
Lost That Lovin' Feelin''', are justifiably famous, but he should
also get credit for being the godfather of rock holiday recordings.
Listen to Bruce Springsteen singing ``Santa Claus is Comin' to
Town'' and it's practically a straight-up ripoff of Spector's
version by The Crystals. No holiday is complete without The
Ronettes singing ``I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus.'' Or Darlene
Love, one of the most underrated female vocalists of the '60s,
belting out a soul-stirring ``Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)''
while enveloped in Spector's cavernous ``Wall of Sound''
production. A great album for any season, but especially this one.

 &HT;    Don't get angry, get smart this tax season
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's no point in getting angry about taxes. Maybe
it's emotionally satisfying, but it won't do any good.
</P>
<P>
   What will help is focusing on things we can control. When it
comes to taxes, that means finding ways to make the tax laws work
for us.
</P>
<P>
   Economist John Maynard Keynes got it right when he said, ``The
avoidance of taxes is the only intellectual pursuit that carries
any reward.''
</P>
<P>
   I grant there are reasons to be mad about taxes. One big reason
is the law itself is difficult to understand. In a survey last
year, only one in four Americans said they prepare their own tax
returns. The majority hire a specialist.
</P>
<P>
   The tax code runs 2.8 million words. The Taxpayer Relief Act of
1997 was 2 inches thick and dropped another 3,000 pages of
scripture on us.
</P>
<P>
   I like Roth IRAs, which were introduced in that new law. But I
can't say that I feel 3,000 pages worth of relief.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, much of your tax law and mine was written solely
for the benefit of special interests. One of the amendments tossed
around this year was a tax credit, worth $84 million or more, to
encourage poultry producers to burn chicken manure and generate
electricity. I am not making this up.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the complexity is the result of a never-ending struggle
between tax collectors and high-dollar tax avoiders. If enough
money is at stake, it's worth hiring an accountant or lawyer to pry
open a loophole. Then it's up to the Internal Revenue Service,
assisted by our elected professionals in Congress, to plug the
loophole with some more law.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to the second reason to be mad about taxes: We,
the people, can't get in on the really sweet tax breaks. They are
reserved for the people who make electricity _ or perhaps I should
say chicken salad.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us feel a wholly appropriate urge to be responsible
citizens. But we also suspect that a lot of other people and
corporations are cutting better deals.
</P>
<P>
   We want some sweetness ourselves. It is a case of loophole envy.
But face it: These are problems that none of us can change before
April 15.
</P>
<P>
   What we can do is recognize that Uncle Sam has chopped open some
loopholes for everybody. They reflect social goals, activities that
our government has decided to reward with tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   There are tax breaks for owning a home and for giving to
charity. There are deductions for saving money, either for our
children's college expenses or for our own retirements. There are
breaks for self-employed people, which we could interpret as an
encouragement of self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to make sure we take full advantage of those
breaks. A related trick is to make sure we don't make any expensive
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy.

 &HT;    `Spiders' spinning profits
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors have piled an astonishing amount of money into index
mutual funds: $244 billion as of last week.
</P>
<P>
   That's a hard number to grasp. It is, by way of comparison,
about the same amount the government spends on national defense
each year.
</P>
<P>
   We could think of that $244 billion as a testimonial to our
thriftiness. We can certainly see that it's enough money to attract
hungry competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the competitors now are ``spiders,'' an investment
alternative that is mostly like a stock and a little bit like an
index fund.
</P>
<P>
   Spider is the salesman's term for a Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
depositary receipt. Technically, a spider is a unit investment
trust. To you and me, it acts like a stock.
</P>
<P>
   A spider owns huge amounts of all the stocks in the S&AMP;P 500
index. When you buy shares in the spider, you are buying an
interest in all those companies at once. In that respect, it's
pretty much like an index fund.
</P>
<P>
   The name may be laughable, something only a marketer could dream
up. But spiders are attracting serious money.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for that popularity, other than advertising, is
that spiders can be bought or sold at any time of the day or night.
``I like the ability to trade it like a stock,'' said William J.
Kring, a certified financial planner in Atlanta. ``If you want to
place an order at 10 o'clock, you can do that. You have full
liquidity during the day.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, mutual funds are traded only at the end of the
market day, at whatever price they are worth at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of trusts is increasing rapidly. Now you can buy
spiderlike trusts that track the Dow 30 (Diamonds, ticker symbol
DIA), the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 (Qubes, ticker symbol: QQQ)
and the S&AMP;P Midcap 400 index (midcap SPDRs, MDY).
</P>
<P>
   More adventurous investors can pick trusts that hold the stocks
of 17 countries (World Equity Benchmark Shares, or WEBS) and nine
industrial sectors tracked by Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, you could construct an entire diversified portfolio
buying only spiders and their cousins.
</P>
<P>
   So which is best, index funds or trusts?
</P>
<P>
   The answer has to be: It depends.
</P>
<P>
   _ For short-term traders, as distinct from investors, spiders
are attractive. You can duck in and out at will. You can buy
spiders on margin or sell them short, if you like that kind of
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   _ For long-term investors, it's a toss-up. ``Both of them are
suitable for the long term,'' said Kris Culp, who manages $8
billion in the five index funds run by T. Rowe Price. ``The things
that make them different probably don't matter that much to
long-term investors.''
</P>
<P>
   _ For slow and steady investors who put in a small amount each
payday, spiders are a terrible idea. That's because there's a sales
commission for each transaction, just like with other stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you use a deep-discount broker and pay as little as $10
per each transaction, the cost is too high. If you can afford to
invest $50 each payday, for example, the sales commission would eat
20 percent of your investment. Stick with index funds, very few of
which charge a front-end load.
</P>
<P>
   _ If taxes drive you buggy, spiders and their kin are worth an
extra look.
</P>
<P>
   Even index mutual funds sell stocks. That usually means capital
gains, which are distributed to shareholders and are taxable.
Spiders are fixed portfolios, meaning they almost never sell any of
their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   According to Morningstar, the Chicago-based funds researcher,
the Vanguard 500 Index fund distributed capital gains of $2.08 per
share from January 1993 through May 1999. Spiders distributed only
9 cents.
</P>
<P>
   One other consideration is cost. Spiders involve a sales
commission; index mutual funds usually have none. Be sure to check
before you buy.
</P>
<P>
   Operating expenses also are important. They ought to be very
low, because you are paying a manager to do almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Spiders have annual expenses of .18 percent. On the mutual fund
side, you can buy S&AMP;P 500 index funds with about the same expense
levels from USAA, Vanguard, Fidelity and Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the mutual funds, and some of the narrowly focused
trusts, may cost much more.

<P>
   Going, going, Guinness
</P>
<P>
   He's going, going, Guinness, according to his second, even more
entertaining memoir, and Sir Alec swears this lament at having
attained old age will be the last.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   A POSITIVELY FINAL APPEARANCE, by Alec Guinness. Viking; 246
pages; $24.95
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty four today,'' glumly notes Alec Guinness at the
beginning of this enchanting diary of a year and a half that
surpasses its predecessor My Name Escapes Me. This late life
success as a memoirist must be a surprise to the author, who is
more comfortable describing himself as an elderly English character
actor.
</P>
<P>
   Longevity itself holds no charms for Guinness. ``That is 30,660
days, mostly wasted,'' he continues. ``If I had been told when I
was eleven, say, that I would live to such an age I think I would
have fainted with nausea. Schoolmasters in their 30s already had
knobby knees, revealed by their long, floppy football shorts ... as
for tufts of hair in ears and nostrils, they were not to be
mentioned except with horror and youthful contempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Guinness walked away from acting 10 years ago, distressed by the
way he looked and by his increasing problems in memorizing
dialogue. ``My compulsion for the limelight is not all that strong;
besides, pride played a part in my decision to retire _ I don't
wish to be seen as I am now when I know there was something better
on offer thirty years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He is still happily ensconced with Merula, his wife of more than
50 years, and loves to potter around his garden, taking care of his
plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
   On a deeper level, Guinness seems to have hit his second _ or,
given his age, fourth _ wind; he's more active than he was in My
Name Escapes Me; he's always taking the train into London for an
art show, a play, or just to savor the glories of the Connaught. He
is, as always, gentle and urbane, a true Englishman, but one with
surprises on nearly every page.
</P>
<P>
   He reads everything, including Carl Hiaasen, whose Skin Tight he
calls ``a good gruesome thriller.'' Balancing that is an addiction
to the classics. Henry James, however, is not to his liking. The
Wings of the Dove forces him to throw up his hands in dismay:
``Over and over I had to return to interminable sentences to try to
fathom _ not so much what he might be getting at under the surface,
which was rarefied to a degree _ but just to grasp the plain story
line.''
</P>
<P>
   The English Patient leaves him cold (``too often suggested bits
and pieces of David Lean classics...'') and Obi-Wan Kenobi at last
lets his feelings about Star Wars out of the bag: ``Twenty years
ago, when it was first shown, it had a freshness, also a sense of
moral good and fun,'' but now he says he fears it has led to a
worldwide taste for a ``fantasy world of secondhand, childish
banalities.''
</P>
<P>
   The fame that it has brought him he finds appalling, and he
tells a young Star Wars fan who approaches him as a living god that
he wants only one favor from him: Never see Star Wars again.
</P>
<P>
   He contemplates Shakespeare and dismisses any possibility that,
say, Marlowe had a hand in the plays: ``Marlowe's stagecraft is
crude or non-existent when compared to Shakespeare's know-how. And
is there a character in Marlowe which makes one smile, let alone
laugh outright?''
</P>
<P>
   He expresses his lifelong affection for Samuel Butler and
approvingly quotes his remark ``The three most important things a
man has are, briefly, his private parts, his money, and his
religious opinions.'' He then proceeds to top Butler by saying,
``The first two diminish with age and only the last is rigid.''
</P>
<P>
   And like all true talents, he flagellates himself for not being
as good as he had once hoped he might be (only mediocrities think
they're really good). When he sees a play with Eileen Atkins and
Michael Gambon, he notes despairingly that he could never have
achieved acting of their caliber. At another time, he says that
``Personally I have only one great regret _ that I never dared
enough. If at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Guinness is always pillorying himself for not dragging down fire
from heaven like Olivier, or some of the old actor-laddies that he
documents with enormous affection in these pages, but he's
persistently misreading his own gifts.
</P>
<P>
   There are different kinds of actors, and Guinness was a
thoughtful, sly minimalist _ a contemporary cross-reference would
be Ben Kingsley. He was eminently suited for movies, where an
arched eyebrow or a slight hesitation can be as eloquent as a
soliloquy. Much as Truffaut always had an intellectual affinity for
Hitchcock, even though he didn't have the vaguest notion of how to
make those kinds of movies, Guinness is always pining for romantic
bravura.
</P>
<P>
   But his readers and fans will have to content themselves with
The Bridge on the River Kwai, and Great Expectations and Oliver
Twist and The Horse's Mouth and Kind Hearts and Coronets and _ to
his horror _ Star Wars.
</P>
<P>
   It's reward enough, for a singular kind of great actor, and, on
the basis of his books, a wonderful man.
</P>
<P>
   Distinquished actor and English gentleman Sir Alec Guinness, is
a gifted memoirist, it turns out, with a deft humor and personal
style. He starts his book by noting that had he known at age 11 he
would live to be 84, he would have `fainted with nausea.' He did
reach 84, however, and, to our good fortune, he's making the most
of it.

   ADULT-ADHD _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ADHD has only within the
last few years been recognized as a legitimate adult diagnosis. ``A
lot of people were trained that people outgrew ADHD,'' said Dr.
Russell Barkley, director of psychology and professor of psychiatry
and neurology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.
``We now know that's not true. Somewhere between 15-20 percent may
outgrow it, but 65-75 percent continue to have symptoms that impair
them markedly as adults.'' (Susman, Palm Beach Post). MOVED.

those who are infected with the virus. Dylan's life has been
dominated by AIDS since he was 3 years old, when both of his
parents and his younger brother were found to be HIV-positive. His
father died of AIDS 9 years ago; his 12-year-old brother Chris died
last month. Aside from a serious bout with shingles in 1994, his
mother has been healthy _ but she's not on any AIDS drugs right
now. Dylan has grown up in the shadow of his brother's illness. He
starred on the freshman football team this season, but no one from
his family came to the games _ his mom was at Scottish Rite
Hospital with Chris. Dylan is a bright, well-spoken boy, but does
poorly in school and seethes with barely concealed anger and
frustration. (Kim, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 45. WITH PHOTOS.

   PETS-WORK _ If she's not sacked out on a desk somewhere or
sprinting up the stairs after an officemate, look for Scarlett
begging a bit of barbecue from a coworker who's just come back from
the restaurant down the street. It may not be what you'd consider
proper office etiquette, but as long as she's not piddling on the
carpet or barging uninvited into staff meetings, Scarlett and
others like her are welcome at a growing number of Austin companies
that allow employees to bring dogs to work. (LeBlanc, Austin

   GARDENS-SEA _ On its surface, Gardens By The Sea, written and
published by the Garden Club of Palm Beach, would seem to have a
fairly limited audience. The introduction, written by local
horticulturist Gene Joyner, calls it ``an in-depth how-to book on
the trials and successes of gardening on oceanfront and near
oceanfront property.'' (Palm Beach Post).MOVED.

   GARDENING-LIFE _ MCCAYSVILLE, Ga. _ Lee May conducts his first
``burn'' in Fightingtown Creek. The mission: get rid of as much of
the myriad of suckering sourwood stumps, briar thickets and
scraggly pines as possible. The mountain folks know ``it makes a
lot more sense to burn this stuff in place than to try hauling it
away.'' So, he lit up a pile and after it was safely burned out, he
lit the next. Until all piles were gone. ``My first burn.'' (May,

   ROSES _ DALTON,Ga. _ Sam Pullen of Dalton knows roses. He knows
them so well in fact that he's still able to gather several dozens
a day even though it's December. What's his secret? ``The more you
pick them, the more they bloom,'' Sam says, ``It takes a lot out of
the rose bush if you don't cut them often.'' During peak season in
June, Sam has picked as many as 30 dozen in one day from his 750
hybrid tea and floribunda bushes. (Flanders, Atlanta

   ADULT-ADHD _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ADHD has only within the
last few years been recognized as a legitimate adult diagnosis. ``A
lot of people were trained that people outgrew ADHD,'' said Dr.
Russell Barkley, director of psychology and professor of psychiatry
and neurology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.
``We now know that's not true. Somewhere between 15-20 percent may
outgrow it, but 65-75 percent continue to have symptoms that impair

<P>
   Before trying a grand jete en tournant, there are a couple of
things you should know.
</P>
<P>
   First, forget about starting your turn in midair, as some ballet
teachers might instruct you. To turn your body you must apply a
torque, or twisting force, to it, and once you're in the air you
have nothing to apply a torque with.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, you begin twisting from the ground up,
clasping your legs together at the apex of your leap while raising
your arms above your head, you will do a rapid 180 degree turn,
which is the object of the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's physics,'' says Ken Laws.
</P>
<P>
   Laws is a professor of physics at Dickinson College in Carlisle,
Pa. He also has a very serious case of balletomania.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three years ago, when Laws' daughter, Virginia, was 5
1/2, she expressed an interest in learning ballet. Her 7-year-old
brother, Kevin, announced that he wanted to learn too. Whereupon
Laws, age 40 then and perhaps due for a pirouette, decided not to
be left out. He signed up with his kids for a class at the Central
Pennsylvania Youth Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next tallest person in the room was as high as my waist,''
he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin dropped out after a year and a half, and Virginia stuck
with it for seven, but Laws was hooked for good. ``It turned my
life upside down,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Laws has never stopped taking ballet classes, sometimes
practicing as many as 15 hours a week. He even performed a few
times with the Youth Ballet as a suitor prince in ``Sleeping
Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, frustrated with instructions from his teachers that he
considered impressionistic, he started applying his knowledge of
physics to jetes, fouettes and other states of balletic motion. He
wrote two books on the subject, one with an eminent ballerina from
the American Ballet Theater, Cynthia Harvey. Along the way he
became a ballet teacher himself.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Tuesday evening thus found Laws facing a crowd of
teen-agers from the Youth Ballet _ the boys all suave in black
leotards and white T-shirts; the girls infectiously pert, their
hair in tight chignons; Laws himself tall and gray but still
chiseled, in street clothes and ballet slippers.
</P>
<P>
   He teaches the kids partnering _ the pas de deux _ and he tries
to slip in a little physics.
</P>
<P>
   Physics can help a dancer understand, he says, why bringing the
legs together will let her complete a grand jete en tournant. Or
why, when she's standing tiptoe on one leg in an arabesque _ bent
at the waist, with her other leg extended horizontally behind her _
and her partner gives her a twist, she will do a rapid ``pencil''
turn if she straightens up and pulls her leg in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using a physical principle there,'' Laws tells the
class. ``What's the principle?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Toooohhhrque!'' shouts a young man.
</P>
<P>
   Torque, he explains good-naturedly, is not the point in this
case. Sure, the boy who twists his partner's hips is applying a
torque, but after that she's on her own, and her angular momentum
stays about the same (although the friction of toe on floor will
slowly wind her down).
</P>
<P>
   Her angular momentum is her rate of spin multiplied by her
moment of inertia, which depends on how her mass is distributed
around her spin axis. If her momentum remains the same but she
reduces her inertia by pulling in her leg, she must spin faster_
that's physics.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation of angular momentum is perhaps the most important
physical principle in ballet, but there's more to ballet than
rotation. Another classic move is the plain grand jete, a
straightforward gazellelike leap.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, who retired from the ABT in 1997, was known for those
jumps; she had great ``hang time,'' although neither she nor any
other jumper ever really hangs, Laws says.
</P>
<P>
   Once the dancer leaves the floor, she's like a ballistic
missile: Her center of gravity follows a fixed parabola. She can't
change that, but she can move parts of her body.
</P>
<P>
   By scissoring her legs open as she nears the top of the arc and
then closing them again as she descends, she makes them take up
most of her center of gravity's vertical motion. For that instant,
her head and torso can actually move horizontally. Spectators focus
on those parts and think the whole dancer is floating.
</P>
<P>
   Laws says that it wasn't his analytic interest that hooked him
on ballet; it was working as a curtain-puller at the Youth Ballet
and watching a pas de deux from the wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was overwhelming,'' he says. ``I would stand back there
with tears streaming down my face.''
</P>
<P>
   In another life Laws might have been a professional dancer
himself. ``He's quite expert, you know,'' Harvey says. ``He just
started too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Physics is what Laws brings to the art he loves. Not many
dancers are as receptive as Harvey was to a scientific analysis of
their art, but sometimes, Laws says, it produces gratifying
results.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, for instance, he was teaching the grand jete
en tournant when it occurred to him to ask whether any of the
students had ever done a full turn in the air instead of the
standard half-turn. None of them had. But one especially
coordinated little powerhouse said she'd like to try.
</P>
<P>
   Laws discussed the conservation of angular momentum with her,
and how in order to execute the full turn she'd have to bring her
legs together in line with her torso at the top of her leap, just
like for the half-turn _ but then hold them there.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the first time she tried it,'' he says, ``she went up in
the air, brought her legs and arms along the axis of rotation _ and
did one and a half turns. I've never seen a more astonished look on
a dancer's face.''
</P>
<P>
   It must have felt like magic to that girl. But it was just
physics.

   The decade-long effort to grow human body parts in the lab has
generated a lot of gossip. Rumor had it, for example, that
lab-grown skin was made from the foreskin of circumcised infants
and steeped in a brew of cow tendon.
</P>
<P>
   A company just south of Boston was said to be manufacturing the
stuff in industrial quantities, spooling out damp pink sheets _ the
size of football fields _ that could be cut to order.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the company in question reveals that the truth has
been stretched more than the foreskin. Skin grafts produced by
Organogenesis Inc. of Canton, Mass., are indeed made from human
foreskin cells mixed with proteins from bovine tendons.
</P>
<P>
   But the cells are separated and multiplied in culture banks
before they're processed. And the grafts are grown individually in
shallow 3-inch-wide wells that yield perfectly round patches, not
NFL-sized sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Parenteau, chief scientific officer at Organogenesis,
explains that a little foreskin goes a long way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's young tissue that has a lot of growth potential,
you can make many, many units from one foreskin'' _ as many as
200,000 grafts from a piece no bigger than a postage stamp. The
resulting product is a pale, paper-thin, semiopaque disk that fits
in the palm of your hand. It's a bit damp on the underside, a bit
sticky, and gives just a little when you pull at the edges, like a
mu shu pancake.
</P>
<P>
   The grafts are most often used to treat venous leg ulcers, a
common complication of vascular disease, obesity and other
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The ulcers, which affect up to a million people in the United
States, form because of sluggish circulation and, for the same
reason, they heal slowly or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   In clinical studies, lab-grown grafts have hastened the rate of
healing, at least in part by stimulating the host's own skin to
regenerate.
</P>
<P>
   For ulcers more than a year old, the grafts were twice as
effective as the standard therapy. It takes only 15 minutes to
apply the graft to the wound and bind it with gauze dressing.
Within a few weeks ``it just becomes you,'' as one observer put it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, applying grafts of a patient's own skin would do the
trick just as well. But using lab-grown skin saves both the cost
and risk of a fullblown surgical procedure.
</P>
<P>
   During the year and a half the Organogenesis skin has been on
the market, doctors have also used it to treat burns, skin-cancer
lesions, diabetic foot ulcers and genetic blistering diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The graft has even come full circle: ``Every part of the body
has been treated with this,'' says Parenteau, ``including the
foreskin.''
</P>
<P>
   Organogenesis procures the skin from mothers who agree before
delivery to hand over their babies' discards. The next step
involves treating the tissue to remove the cells most likely to
arouse a host's immune response.
</P>
<P>
   Then the tissue is separated into two cell types: fibroblasts,
which build the lower layer of the skin, called the dermis, and
keratinocytes, which provide the protective top layer, the
epidermis.
</P>
<P>
   The fibroblasts are added to culture dishes along with liquid
nutrients and collagen, a protein building block of skin extracted
from the tendons of butchered calves.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, after the fibroblasts have established the
lower, dermal layer, keratinocytes are added. When they have spread
over the dermis, the whole matrix is lifted slightly above the
culture medium on a cotton pad.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting exposure to air signals the keratinocytes to form
a tough outer layer, called the stratum corneum, that resists
injury and infection. The entire procedure takes 20 days from start
to finish.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds simple, but coaxing the cells to perform their natural
repertoire of behavior in such an unnatural setting took years of
trial-and-error experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember the day we knew that our method of growing
keratinocytes was going to work,'' Parenteau says. ``And then we
had to repeat it 10 times before we got it to work again.''
</P>
<P>
   Lab-grown skin is the first living product of tissue engineering
to reach the market, in part because its structure is relatively
simple compared with other organs and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   But disagreement has arisen about the best approach. The
strategy Parenteau works with is noteworthy for its two-layer graft
and its production volume: The company ships hundreds of patches
weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Other labs are developing single-layer dermal grafts grown from
the host's own skin cells. The process requires only a dime-sized
piece of healthy skin taken from just about anywhere on the body.
The strategy would be a boon to patients such as burn victims who
don't have enough undamaged skin to contribute ordinary grafts.
</P>
<P>
   Although it will inevitably cost much more, this approach is
favored by researchers who fear that foreign grafts could carry
infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes more sense to grow your own skin back,'' says Charles
Vacanti, director of the Center for Tissue Engineering at the
University of Massachusetts Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Vacanti himself is using animals to experiment with customized
grafts that are painted on their hosts one layer at a time. Instead
of employing collagen for the skin's structural scaffolding, he
mixes the skin cells with a gelatinlike compound that hardens as it
warms to body temperature, so the graft sticks and stays stuck. The
idea is to get the cells into their natural environment as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any tissue develops differently in a dish than it does in a
living recipient,'' Vacanti says. ``As much as we try to mimic the
chemical environment (of the body) in an incubator, we just can't.
And it'll be years before we figure out what all the environmental
factors do. To have a fully normal tissue, it has to be at least
partially generated in place, in situ.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, even the most sophisticated lab-grown skin lacks some of
the features of ordinary skin. The grafts don't have any color, for
instance, although they acquire the host's pigmentation as they
naturalize. And while nerve endings and blood vessels do migrate
into the new skin, sweat glands and hair follicles don't, even
years after the graft is applied.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at Organogenesis and other labs are working on ways
to incorporate these features into the grafts themselves. Vacanti
hopes someday to include every cell type found in natural skin in
his customized system.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Before trying a grand jete en tournant, there are a couple of
things you should know.
</P>
<P>
   First, forget about starting your turn in midair, as some ballet
teachers might instruct you. To turn your body you must apply a
torque, or twisting force, to it, and once you're in the air you
have nothing to apply a torque with.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, you begin twisting from the ground up,
clasping your legs together at the apex of your leap while raising
your arms above your head, you will do a rapid 180 degree turn,
which is the object of the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's physics,'' says Ken Laws.
</P>
<P>
   Laws is a professor of physics at Dickinson College in Carlisle,
Pa. He also has a very serious case of balletomania.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three years ago, when Laws' daughter, Virginia, was 5
1/2, she expressed an interest in learning ballet. Her 7-year-old
brother, Kevin, announced that he wanted to learn too. Whereupon
Laws, age 40 then and perhaps due for a pirouette, decided not to
be left out. He signed up with his kids for a class at the Central
Pennsylvania Youth Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next tallest person in the room was as high as my waist,''
he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin dropped out after a year and a half, and Virginia stuck
with it for seven, but Laws was hooked for good. ``It turned my
life upside down,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Laws has never stopped taking ballet classes, sometimes
practicing as many as 15 hours a week. He even performed a few
times with the Youth Ballet as a suitor prince in ``Sleeping
Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, frustrated with instructions from his teachers that he
considered impressionistic, he started applying his knowledge of
physics to jetes, fouettes and other states of balletic motion. He
wrote two books on the subject, one with an eminent ballerina from
the American Ballet Theater, Cynthia Harvey. Along the way he
became a ballet teacher himself.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Tuesday evening thus found Laws facing a crowd of
teen-agers from the Youth Ballet _ the boys all suave in black
leotards and white T-shirts; the girls infectiously pert, their
hair in tight chignons; Laws himself tall and gray but still
chiseled, in street clothes and ballet slippers.
</P>
<P>
   He teaches the kids partnering _ the pas de deux _ and he tries
to slip in a little physics.
</P>
<P>
   Physics can help a dancer understand, he says, why bringing the
legs together will let her complete a grand jete en tournant. Or
why, when she's standing tiptoe on one leg in an arabesque _ bent
at the waist, with her other leg extended horizontally behind her _
and her partner gives her a twist, she will do a rapid ``pencil''
turn if she straightens up and pulls her leg in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using a physical principle there,'' Laws tells the
class. ``What's the principle?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Toooohhhrque!'' shouts a young man.
</P>
<P>
   Torque, he explains good-naturedly, is not the point in this
case. Sure, the boy who twists his partner's hips is applying a
torque, but after that she's on her own, and her angular momentum
stays about the same (although the friction of toe on floor will
slowly wind her down).
</P>
<P>
   Her angular momentum is her rate of spin multiplied by her
moment of inertia, which depends on how her mass is distributed
around her spin axis. If her momentum remains the same but she
reduces her inertia by pulling in her leg, she must spin faster_
that's physics.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation of angular momentum is perhaps the most important
physical principle in ballet, but there's more to ballet than
rotation. Another classic move is the plain grand jete, a
straightforward gazellelike leap.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, who retired from the ABT in 1997, was known for those
jumps; she had great ``hang time,'' although neither she nor any
other jumper ever really hangs, Laws says.
</P>
<P>
   Once the dancer leaves the floor, she's like a ballistic
missile: Her center of gravity follows a fixed parabola. She can't
change that, but she can move parts of her body.
</P>
<P>
   By scissoring her legs open as she nears the top of the arc and
then closing them again as she descends, she makes them take up
most of her center of gravity's vertical motion. For that instant,
her head and torso can actually move horizontally. Spectators focus
on those parts and think the whole dancer is floating.
</P>
<P>
   Laws says that it wasn't his analytic interest that hooked him
on ballet; it was working as a curtain-puller at the Youth Ballet
and watching a pas de deux from the wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was overwhelming,'' he says. ``I would stand back there
with tears streaming down my face.''
</P>
<P>
   In another life Laws might have been a professional dancer
himself. ``He's quite expert, you know,'' Harvey says. ``He just
started too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Physics is what Laws brings to the art he loves. Not many
dancers are as receptive as Harvey was to a scientific analysis of
their art, but sometimes, Laws says, it produces gratifying
results.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, for instance, he was teaching the grand jete
en tournant when it occurred to him to ask whether any of the
students had ever done a full turn in the air instead of the
standard half-turn. None of them had. But one especially
coordinated little powerhouse said she'd like to try.
</P>
<P>
   Laws discussed the conservation of angular momentum with her,
and how in order to execute the full turn she'd have to bring her
legs together in line with her torso at the top of her leap, just
like for the half-turn _ but then hold them there.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the first time she tried it,'' he says, ``she went up in
the air, brought her legs and arms along the axis of rotation _ and
did one and a half turns. I've never seen a more astonished look on
a dancer's face.''
</P>
<P>
   It must have felt like magic to that girl. But it was just
physics.

and her partner gives her a twist, she will do a rapid ``pencil''
turn if she straightens up and pulls her leg in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using a physical principle there,'' Laws tells the
class. ``What's the principle?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Toooohhhrque!'' shouts a young man.
</P>
<P>
   Torque, he explains good-naturedly, is not the point in this
case. Sure, the boy who twists his partner's hips is applying a
torque, but after that she's on her own, and her angular momentum
stays about the same (although the friction of toe on floor will
slowly wind her down).
</P>
<P>
   Her angular momentum is her rate of spin multiplied by her
moment of inertia, which depends on how her mass is distributed
around her spin axis. If her momentum remains the same but she
reduces her inertia by pulling in her leg, she must spin faster_
that's physics.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation of angular momentum is perhaps the most important
physical principle in ballet, but there's more to ballet than
rotation. Another classic move is the plain grand jete, a
straightforward gazellelike leap.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, who retired from the ABT in 1997, was known for those
jumps; she had great ``hang time,'' although neither she nor any
other jumper ever really hangs, Laws says.
</P>
<P>
   Once the dancer leaves the floor, she's like a ballistic
missile: Her center of gravity follows a fixed parabola. She can't
change that, but she can move parts of her body.
</P>
<P>
   By scissoring her legs open as she nears the top of the arc and
then closing them again as she descends, she makes them take up
most of her center of gravity's vertical motion. For that instant,
her head and torso can actually move horizontally. Spectators focus
on those parts and think the whole dancer is floating.
</P>
<P>
   Laws says that it wasn't his analytic interest that hooked him
on ballet; it was working as a curtain-puller at the Youth Ballet
and watching a pas de deux from the wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was overwhelming,'' he says. ``I would stand back there
with tears streaming down my face.''
</P>
<P>
   In another life Laws might have been a professional dancer
himself. ``He's quite expert, you know,'' Harvey says. ``He just
started too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Physics is what Laws brings to the art he loves. Not many
dancers are as receptive as Harvey was to a scientific analysis of
their art, but sometimes, Laws says, it produces gratifying
results.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, for instance, he was teaching the grand jete
en tournant when it occurred to him to ask whether any of the
students had ever done a full turn in the air instead of the
standard half-turn. None of them had. But one especially
coordinated little powerhouse said she'd like to try.
</P>
<P>
   Laws discussed the conservation of angular momentum with her,
and how in order to execute the full turn she'd have to bring her
legs together in line with her torso at the top of her leap, just
like for the half-turn _ but then hold them there.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the first time she tried it,'' he says, ``she went up in
the air, brought her legs and arms along the axis of rotation _ and
did one and a half turns. I've never seen a more astonished look on
a dancer's face.''
</P>
<P>
   It must have felt like magic to that girl. But it was just
physics.

<P>
   The decade-long effort to grow human body parts in the lab has
generated a lot of gossip. Rumor had it, for example, that
lab-grown skin was made from the foreskin of circumcised infants
and steeped in a brew of cow tendon.
</P>
<P>
   A company just south of Boston was said to be manufacturing the
stuff in industrial quantities, spooling out damp pink sheets _ the
size of football fields _ that could be cut to order.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the company in question reveals that the truth has
been stretched more than the foreskin. Skin grafts produced by
Organogenesis Inc. of Canton, Mass., are indeed made from human
foreskin cells mixed with proteins from bovine tendons.
</P>
<P>
   But the cells are separated and multiplied in culture banks
before they're processed. And the grafts are grown individually in
shallow 3-inch-wide wells that yield perfectly round patches, not
NFL-sized sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Parenteau, chief scientific officer at Organogenesis,
explains that a little foreskin goes a long way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's young tissue that has a lot of growth potential,
you can make many, many units from one foreskin'' _ as many as
200,000 grafts from a piece no bigger than a postage stamp. The
resulting product is a pale, paper-thin, semiopaque disk that fits
in the palm of your hand. It's a bit damp on the underside, a bit
sticky, and gives just a little when you pull at the edges, like a
mu shu pancake.
</P>
<P>
   The grafts are most often used to treat venous leg ulcers, a
common complication of vascular disease, obesity and other
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The ulcers, which affect up to a million people in the United
States, form because of sluggish circulation and, for the same
reason, they heal slowly or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   In clinical studies, lab-grown grafts have hastened the rate of
healing, at least in part by stimulating the host's own skin to
regenerate.
</P>
<P>
   For ulcers more than a year old, the grafts were twice as
effective as the standard therapy. It takes only 15 minutes to
apply the graft to the wound and bind it with gauze dressing.
Within a few weeks ``it just becomes you,'' as one observer put it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, applying grafts of a patient's own skin would do the
trick just as well. But using lab-grown skin saves both the cost
and risk of a fullblown surgical procedure.
</P>
<P>
   During the year and a half the Organogenesis skin has been on
the market, doctors have also used it to treat burns, skin-cancer
lesions, diabetic foot ulcers and genetic blistering diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The graft has even come full circle: ``Every part of the body
has been treated with this,'' says Parenteau, ``including the
foreskin.''
</P>
<P>
   Organogenesis procures the skin from mothers who agree before
delivery to hand over their babies' discards. The next step
involves treating the tissue to remove the cells most likely to
arouse a host's immune response.
</P>
<P>
   Then the tissue is separated into two cell types: fibroblasts,
which build the lower layer of the skin, called the dermis, and
keratinocytes, which provide the protective top layer, the
epidermis.
</P>
<P>
   The fibroblasts are added to culture dishes along with liquid
nutrients and collagen, a protein building block of skin extracted
from the tendons of butchered calves.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, after the fibroblasts have established the
lower, dermal layer, keratinocytes are added. When they have spread
over the dermis, the whole matrix is lifted slightly above the
culture medium on a cotton pad.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting exposure to air signals the keratinocytes to form
a tough outer layer, called the stratum corneum, that resists
injury and infection. The entire procedure takes 20 days from start
to finish.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds simple, but coaxing the cells to perform their natural
repertoire of behavior in such an unnatural setting took years of
trial-and-error experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember the day we knew that our method of growing
keratinocytes was going to work,'' Parenteau says. ``And then we
had to repeat it 10 times before we got it to work again.''
</P>
<P>
   Lab-grown skin is the first living product of tissue engineering
to reach the market, in part because its structure is relatively
simple compared with other organs and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   But disagreement has arisen about the best approach. The
strategy Parenteau works with is noteworthy for its two-layer graft
and its production volume: The company ships hundreds of patches
weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Other labs are developing single-layer dermal grafts grown from
the host's own skin cells. The process requires only a dime-sized
piece of healthy skin taken from just about anywhere on the body.
The strategy would be a boon to patients such as burn victims who
don't have enough undamaged skin to contribute ordinary grafts.
</P>
<P>
   Although it will inevitably cost much more, this approach is
favored by researchers who fear that foreign grafts could carry
infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes more sense to grow your own skin back,'' says Charles
Vacanti, director of the Center for Tissue Engineering at the
University of Massachusetts Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Vacanti himself is using animals to experiment with customized
grafts that are painted on their hosts one layer at a time. Instead
of employing collagen for the skin's structural scaffolding, he
mixes the skin cells with a gelatinlike compound that hardens as it
warms to body temperature, so the graft sticks and stays stuck. The
idea is to get the cells into their natural environment as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any tissue develops differently in a dish than it does in a
living recipient,'' Vacanti says. ``As much as we try to mimic the
chemical environment (of the body) in an incubator, we just can't.
And it'll be years before we figure out what all the environmental
factors do. To have a fully normal tissue, it has to be at least
partially generated in place, in situ.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, even the most sophisticated lab-grown skin lacks some of
the features of ordinary skin. The grafts don't have any color, for
instance, although they acquire the host's pigmentation as they
naturalize. And while nerve endings and blood vessels do migrate
into the new skin, sweat glands and hair follicles don't, even
years after the graft is applied.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at Organogenesis and other labs are working on ways
to incorporate these features into the grafts themselves. Vacanti
hopes someday to include every cell type found in natural skin in
his customized system.

 &HT;    Don't get angry, get smart this tax season
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's no point in getting angry about taxes. Maybe
it's emotionally satisfying, but it won't do any good.
</P>
<P>
   What will help is focusing on things we can control. When it
comes to taxes, that means finding ways to make the tax laws work
for us.
</P>
<P>
   Economist John Maynard Keynes got it right when he said, ``The
avoidance of taxes is the only intellectual pursuit that carries
any reward.''
</P>
<P>
   I grant there are reasons to be mad about taxes. One big reason
is the law itself is difficult to understand. In a survey last
year, only one in four Americans said they prepare their own tax
returns. The majority hire a specialist.
</P>
<P>
   The tax code runs 2.8 million words. The Taxpayer Relief Act of
1997 was 2 inches thick and dropped another 3,000 pages of
scripture on us.
</P>
<P>
   I like Roth IRAs, which were introduced in that new law. But I
can't say that I feel 3,000 pages worth of relief.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, much of your tax law and mine was written solely
for the benefit of special interests. One of the amendments tossed
around this year was a tax credit, worth $84 million or more, to
encourage poultry producers to burn chicken manure and generate
electricity. I am not making this up.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the complexity is the result of a never-ending struggle
between tax collectors and high-dollar tax avoiders. If enough
money is at stake, it's worth hiring an accountant or lawyer to pry
open a loophole. Then it's up to the Internal Revenue Service,
assisted by our elected professionals in Congress, to plug the
loophole with some more law.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to the second reason to be mad about taxes: We,
the people, can't get in on the really sweet tax breaks. They are
reserved for the people who make electricity _ or perhaps I should
say chicken salad.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us feel a wholly appropriate urge to be responsible
citizens. But we also suspect that a lot of other people and
corporations are cutting better deals.
</P>
<P>
   We want some sweetness ourselves. It is a case of loophole envy.
But face it: These are problems that none of us can change before
April 15.
</P>
<P>
   What we can do is recognize that Uncle Sam has chopped open some
loopholes for everybody. They reflect social goals, activities that
our government has decided to reward with tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   There are tax breaks for owning a home and for giving to
charity. There are deductions for saving money, either for our
children's college expenses or for our own retirements. There are
breaks for self-employed people, which we could interpret as an
encouragement of self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to make sure we take full advantage of those
breaks. A related trick is to make sure we don't make any expensive
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   With the 20th century winding to a close, what better
opportunity is there to rethink certain beauty adages?
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's favorite _ ``it's impossible to be too rich or too
thin'' _ is so obvious it's no longer appropriate. A more suitable
version? Your skin can never be too perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Perfection is a lofty goal, but thanks to innovations in the
skin-care market, it's one that is almost within reach.
</P>
<P>
   The most revered ingredient to hit your beauty cabinet is
retinol, the stabilized version of pure vitamin A that received a
lot of positive attention when it was first introduced early last
year.
</P>
<P>
   (For years now, dermatologists have been prescribing Retin-A and
Renova, the FDA-approved topical treatments that use a vitamin A
derivative for combating acne and fine wrinkles, respectively.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're beginning not to love what's staring at you in the
mirror, then a vitamin A product is the single best investment you
can make for yourself,'' says Dr. David E. Bank, a dermatologist
and the director of The Center for Dermatology, Cosmetic &AMP; Laser
Surgery in Mount Kisco, N.Y. Bank considers retinol products an
effective substitute for prescription treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Now the wonder ingredient is even more attainable with products
like the new L'Oreal Plenitude Line Eraser, an evening cream
featuring retinol.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a patented formula created by the mad scientists at
L'Oreal, Line Eraser delivers all of the benefits of vitamin A _ a
smoother and more even complexion in two weeks, significantly
diminished fine lines in four weeks _ without the irritation and
discomfort usually associated with other forms of vitamin A
products.
</P>
<P>
   According to Didier Gagnebien,, vice president of treatment and
cosmetics for L'Oreal Research and Development, creating an
effective retinol cream with none of the drawbacks was the biggest
challenge in Line Eraser's development, but completely worth the
wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vitamin A helps with skin-cell renewal,'' Gagnebien says. ``In
doing that, it thickens the epidermis, which is critical because
the older you get, the thinner your epidermis gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinner skin translates into wrinkles that are more visible to
the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our patented formula is the perfect balance between efficacy
and tolerance,'' Gagnebien says. ``It can be used by any skin type,
every day.''

MURPHY, NOW A BRUIN, HAS BEEN AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He first appeared on the sports landscape back in the
spring of 1990, when he was an enthusiastic 22-year-old kid. Joe
Murphy's linemates then were 22-year-old Adam Graves and
19-year-old Martin Gelinas, and they were known as the Edmonton
Oilers' ``Kid Line.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, now a Bruin who is recovering from a knee injury,
remembers skating the Stanley Cup around Boston Garden, and he even
has a photo on his wall back in Chicago of him and his linemates
with the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny how life turns out sometimes. Gelinas is now with the
Carolina Hurricanes and Graves plays for the New York Rangers.
Murphy, who started his career in Detroit, went from Edmonton to
Chicago to St. Louis to San Jose before landing here, with the team
he rooted for as a kid. Murphy has played one game for Boston _
against New Jersey Nov. 17 _ but he could return to the lineup
Thursday against the Capitals in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado goalie Patrick Roy was a rookie with Montreal when he
won the Stanley Cup, and he said it wasn't until much later in his
career that he realized just how difficult it was to reach that
goal. When you win it so young, Roy said, you expect to win it
every year. Ray Bourque, by contrast, is in his 21st season and
hasn't won it yet.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy appreciates his time with the Oilers for a lot of
reasons, and he understands what Roy is talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate to be on such a great team,'' he said. ``We
thought every year we'd be back in there. It was really something
to go to the finals and win the Stanley Cup. It's been a while
since I've been there. I've been to the semifinals three or four
times after that, so I've knocked on the door but just haven't
gotten in again. It would be something for this team to have a
shot. It would be incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy knew on the first the day of practice that his time with
the Oilers was going to be a remarkable experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at the hotel and Mark Messier said he'd pick us up for
our first practice,'' said Murphy, referring to himself and Graves.
``He arrives in this big Bentley. We both jumped in the back. We
felt like we were part of government going to practice. It was just
hilarious. Mark Messier to me, still to this day, he's such a great
leader. He's my favorite player.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's life changed when he went to Edmonton. When he began
his pro career, as the No. 1 overall pick by the Red Wings in 1986,
the expectations were overwhelming. Detroit had been on a downward
spiral for quite some time. At the tender age of 18, Murphy was
expected to come in and turn around the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But Murphy never thought of himself as a savior. He was a kid
trying to carve out a niche for himself. It turned out be a very
lonely time. Veteran players were worried about their own jobs.
There was no one there to throw Murphy a rope. That has made him
want to be a role model or sounding board for younger players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do anything to help younger guys,'' he said. ``They need
some help, they need some guidance. It's nice. I did have questions
and I didn't have anyone to turn to. Players were battling for
jobs. Looking back on it, I understand it. I don't mind battling
for the job but sometimes you need a little help.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins assistant general manager Mike O'Connell, who was
Murphy's roommate when the youngster broke in, said it was a tough
spot to be in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difficult time because the team was a last-place team
for a few years,'' said O'Connell. ``We had a new coach in Jacques
Demers and Joe was coming in as a highly touted kid. Joe really
didn't know what to expect, nor should he, as most kids don't. Back
then, it was a little different. People expected he was going to
save the franchise; it doesn't happen too often. Expectations were
high and he wasn't ready to do it. Not that he was a bad player,
but you're asking a hell of a lot for a young kid to come in and do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Pat Falloon, who was supposed to carry the weight of
the San Jose Sharks franchise at 18. Just ask Alexandre Daigle, who
was supposed to do the same with Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every player goes through adversity and tough times,'' said
Murphy. ``I was drafted at 18 and I wasn't ready to play in the
NHL. I was the first pick and I took a ton of heat. I was sent to
the minors and that's too young now (with the existing rules). I
was 18 playing in the minors against pro guys who weren't very
happy that I was down there. I was up and down my first few years.
It was frustrating but I think that's why I'm still here and still
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was traded to Edmonton, he didn't realize how much his
life was about to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of my favorite times ever playing the game,'' he
said. ``We were really eager and young and we all looked up to Mark
Messier and Jari Kurri and Glenn Anderson and Grant Fuhr and all
those guys. They were my heroes when I was 14, 15, or 16. Those
were the guys I looked up to, and to be on that team, it was just
incredible. It was so much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   With Graves and Gelinas, Murphy was comfortable. Not only was he
part of his own peer group, but given the talent of the Oilers'
veterans, he wasn't being asked to carry the entire load.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really looked out for each other,'' he said. ``We really
went to battle on the ice for each other, every game, every shift.
We really had something that will last forever. Whenever I see
those guys, I realize it was a great moment in time.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most memorable games of that Stanley Cup run was Game
1 of the finals when Edmonton beat Boston in triple overtime.
Murphy will never forget the winning goal, by Petr Klima, and what
led up to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember (then Boston defenseman) Glen Wesley had that
wide-open net,'' said Murphy, referring to the second overtime. ``I
was backchecking and we wiped out Billy (Ranford) into the net and
that's why he had an open net. Wesley shot and it went over the
net. After that game, luckily we had two days in between games. I
remember nine of us got sick, we got dehydrated. We were just sick,
it was ridiculous. I was so done. I was tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said he has been fortunate to play with some top forwards
over the years. His favorites are Bernie Nicholls, Vincent
Damphousse, and Jeremy Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie and I really worked well together,'' said Murphy. ``He
came to play hard, he was a true competitor and a professional.
Jeremy was one of the best competitors I've ever played with. He
was cocky, he was perfect for Chicago. I think (his departure)
started all of Chicago's problems. He was what the city was all
about. Working hard, and brash and going for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy thought his life would be even more idyllic in St. Louis,
where he signed a three-year contract that was criticized around
the league for its excessive value. Murphy was paid $2.8 million,
$3.4 million, and $3.8 million. The last season and change of the
contract he spent with the Sharks after the Blues traded him.
</P>
<P>
   The backlash and inflated expectations were like Detroit all
over again and it hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard, it was tough on me,'' he said. ``The first year,
I scored 20 goals and felt I played good, but more was expected of
me because of the type of money I was making. I got offered a great
contract. It's pretty tough to turn it down. I'm more happy playing
for the amount of money I'm playing for now than I was at that
amount. Then my second year there I got hurt. I thought I was
playing the best hockey I'd ever played but the puck wasn't going
in the net. I was playing well all over the ice but I was having a
hard time scoring. I was playing with Geoff Courtnall and Pavol
Demitra. But I went in on a breakaway, got tripped, and snapped my
wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Murphy scored 25 goals for the Sharks, but it took
him until Nov. 12 of this year to find an offer. Part of it was
that Murphy was affected by the changing climate in the league;
owners are no longer free-spending on free agents. The Rangers, who
overpay for nearly everyone, stick out like a sore thumb as more
and more clubs are cutting expenses rather than increasing them.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy understood all that but it was frustrating to have no
team to go to at 32 years old and coming off the year he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a changing of the guard a little bit and a changing of
the thinking,'' said Murphy. ``They have to bean-count, they have a
business to run. New York was the only really active team in the
market and they were bidding against themselves. The climate has
definitely changed.''
</P>
<P>
   And Murphy, too, has changed. Gone is the naive kid who first
broke into the league in 1986. His black hair is flecked with gray,
and despite some of the disappointment, he wakes up every day and
considers himself so fortunate to be where he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all lucky to play this game,'' he said. ``We make a
great living. You're at the rink and your job is to stay in top
condition and who doesn't want to do that? You get to perform in
front of crowds and try to win the Stanley Cup together and then
you get summers off. It's hard to look at the (long view) after
you've had a bad game or you're benched but you keep things in
perspective. I think I've picked that up over time.''

THE DISSIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What degree of loyalty does a policy adviser owe the team on
which he serves? Nearly 30 years ago, Paul McCracken quit as
Richard Nixon's chief economic adviser rather than implement a
policy of price controls _ but he held his tongue even out of
office.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Feldstein, on the other hand, feuded publicly with other
members of the Reagan administration over the economic significance
of the exploding deficit in 1983 and 1984, while serving as
chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. There are those who
believe that he thereby seriously diminished the council's place in
the firmament of power.
</P>
<P>
   Feldstein eventually left office under his own steam. But
subsequent appointees in the Reagan and Bush administrations were
selected for their docility. And when Bill Clinton took over the
White House in 1993, he immediately created a more explicitly
political advisory layer in the form of the National Economic
Council. Its first chief was Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Joseph Stiglitz became the most recent figure in the
parade of dissidents when he announced on the eve of Thanksgiving
his departure from the office of chief economist at the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the bank's economist is anywhere near as important as
the president's corps of economic advisers. His biggest job is to
prepare the annual World Development Report and discover other ways
to use his office as a bully pulpit, mostly to the developing
world. In the past decade, the position has served as a launching
pad for advisers aspiring to more responsibility: Lawrence Summers
and Stanley Fischer preceded Stiglitz in the job.
</P>
<P>
   But the widespread suspicion in Washington that Summers, now
secretary of the Treasury, insisted on Stigliz's departure as a
precondition for the reappointment of bank president James
Wolfensohn to a second five-year term suggests just how nettlesome
the 57-year-old economist had become during the several years he
served in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Stiglitz was an unmistakable free spirit even before he joined
the administration. Distinguished enough as a theorist to be
considered a likely candidate someday for a Nobel Prize, he
nevertheless left Princeton University for Stanford after the
former declined to offer tenure to his wife. A ``new Keynesian''
economist, he has been drawn to problems of market failure _ to the
point of having it said that he never met a scheme for government
intervention he did not like.
</P>
<P>
   During a stint at the Council of Economic Advisers, Stiglitz
shunned controversy for the most part. But once at the World Bank,
the Asian financial crisis and its aftermath led him to question
the International Monetary Fund's response to the dilemma. And in
recent months Stiglitz repeatedly has raised questions about the
conduct of policy by Washington and its European allies before and
after the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on global integration before all else may have been
misplaced, Stiglitz has argued. Short-term capital flows to
developing countries may have been a boon to Wall Street _ but a
curse to fragile political authority in newly industrializing
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the choice of ``conditionality'' as a way of changing
policy _ requiring privatization, budgetary austerity, and
macroeconomic stability as preconditions for further assistance _
may have been downright wrong. More than a few minds have been
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Stiglitz afforded a clear view of the candor that made
him among the administration's least wanted men. He fired off two
new bursts of genteel criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the Economic Journal, Stiglitz called for a
significant reorientation of the World Bank's mission. Henceforth
it should focus its lending on projects promising significant
poverty reduction, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And in a separate speech at the Harvard University Center for
Business and Government at the John F. Kennedy School, Stigliz
called on the World Trade Organization to address developing
country priorities as never before. Trade ministers meeting in
Seattle are seeking to begin a lengthy new round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Stiglitz's criticism of the handling of the Asian crisis
has the taint of hindsight and second-guessing. Where was he on the
issues in the years before the hard decisions were being made? Yet
it is hard not to admire the conviction of an economist who has
begun to speak for his clients. The world's poorest citizens can
use all the sophisticated advocacy they can get.

A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GORE, BRADLEY? TRY MEDICAID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ Just by plucking two states out of the air _ say,
Iowa and New Hampshire _ you can understand why the Bill Bradley-Al
Gore argument over health care is not about nothing, especially
where the most vulnerable are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Medicaid, the safety net that is there for everyone,
there are more than 300,000 beneficiaries in the first caucus state
and more than 100,000 in the first primary state. In fact,
everybody has a stake in Medicaid, whether they think of themselves
as health care consumers, taxpayers, nursing home residents, or the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore wants to take Medicaid and build on it,
working through the states to add people and improve coverage as a
major means of slashing into the number of Americans with no access
to affordable health care and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator wants to take a wrecking ball to
the whole system. Bradley might be onto something _ if he were
offering something better, but he's not. Instead, he's offering the
snake oil of vouchers to those for whom Medicaid means basic health
care services (more than 30 percent of the live births in Iowa and
more than a quarter of the live births in New Hampshire, for
example).
</P>
<P>
   For the people who have access to long-term care under Medicaid,
including the disabled and the elderly in nursing homes, he's
offering dependence on the rarely tender mercies and typically
stingy budgets of state governments in return for a federal
assumption of the portion of Medicaid that serves the needy.
</P>
<P>
   For three months Bradley has had a chance to lead a national
dialogue about health care, to build on the promising notions he
first floated in an effort to move the country toward genuinely
universal coverage at responsible cost.
</P>
<P>
   And he's blown it. By sticking to proposals that have huge holes
in them, Bradley has made the prospect of change a threat to
everyone, whether they're currently covered or not. He likes to
disparage Gore as ``timid'' and incremental, but the vice president
has ideas than can make the system better by a mile.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's vouchers make the case. At first, his proposal offered
to pay the entire premium for all adults below the poverty line
(via a refundable tax credit paid in advance) to get insurance
either through their workplace or by making the federal employees
system available to all. But when cost concerns were raised,
Bradley shifted and said the benefit would be capped.
</P>
<P>
   For a single adult with income at the poverty line, the
insurance premium cap would be $1,800 a year.
</P>
<P>
   What can you get for $1,800? Next to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the scores of choices available in the model system for
federal workers, fully 95 percent cost more than that; in fact,
well over half cost more than than $2,400 a year. The choice most
frequently made by workers _ standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield _
costs more than $2,830. In fact, if you browse the Bradley
campaign's Web site, you will find the notation that the average
cost of an individual option under the federal plan is more than
$3,300.
</P>
<P>
   This is worse than snake oil. Keep in mind that for more than
220,000 kids and adults in Iowa and more than 75,000 in New
Hampshire, this is life itself.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley offers an even lousier deal to the disabled. In the case
of AIDS patients, for example, fully half currently receive care
under Medicaid. For them, $1,800 isn't even peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley response is a suggestion that assigned risk pools in
a universally expanded federal employee system would provide
adequate protection and care. In a pig's eye; in fact, this would
be just one way that system could be overloaded with desperate
people, sending costs and premiums through the roof for everyone.
For the disabled, the answer is improved Medicaid, not false
promises with huge hidden costs.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid also funds the care of two out of every three residents
of nursing homes. It pays half of all these rapidly increasing
costs, which average $41,000 a year; and it pays two of every five
dollars spent on long-term care. More than that, after hard-fought
political battles, Medicaid offers quality-control regulations, not
to mention other rules that keep the relatives of patients from
having to spend themselves into poverty to be eligible for
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   That is why no governor in his right minds _ and that includes
Democrats Tom Vilsack in Iowa and Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire _
has jumped to endorse a scheme that would turn this ticking fiscal
time bomb over to the states.
</P>
<P>
   To Bradley this is all scare tactics, politics as usual,
unworthy of his lofty, high-concept, principled discussion of the
great issues of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Baloney. What Medicaid shows, what broader discussion of health
insurance has already shown is simple. Bradley is wrong and Gore is
right.

BORDER TOWNS FEAR HIGHER MEXICAN FEE WILL PUT BRAKES ON TOURISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico _ As mayor of this industrial city across
the Rio Grande from El Paso, Texas, Gustavo Elizondo Aguilar has
tried hard to attract more American tourists, shoppers, and
businesses to his side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   But a new federal law, drawn up by bureaucrats 1,500 miles away
in Mexico City, will make it harder _ if not impossible, he said _
to make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to crack down on illegally imported cars from the
United States and to recoup millions of dollars in lost tax
revenues, the Treasury Ministry will dramatically increase the
deposit required from American and Canadian motorists who travel
into Mexico's interior. Beginning this week, the deposit will
increase from the current $11 a car to as much as $800 for each
vehicle that travels beyond the 15-mile border zone.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy that has followed the new rule has sparked a
cross-border squabble between the US and Mexican governments _ only
days before global trade representatives gather for this year's
World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle _ as well as with many
Mexican-American residents, who fear the higher fees will prevent
many of them from visiting relatives in Mexico during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this decision was made to hurt relations between
the United States and Mexico,'' Elizondo said last week from his
office, which has a view of downtown El Paso, less than a mile
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's hard to see the logic in this decision,'' he added.
``The people in Mexico City who decide these things don't
understand the environment that we're trying to develop up here on
the border.''
</P>
<P>
   And in light of the five-year-old North American Free Trade
Agreement, which among other things is supposed to foster more
cross-border commerce and tourism along the US-Mexico boundary, the
Treasury Ministry's decision is even more puzzling, residents said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economies of the border are already under stress because
of a lack of infrastructure and high unemployment,'' said Mike
Allen, president of the Economic Development Corporation in
McAllen, Texas, a border city of 500,000 residents that relies
heavily on NAFTA manufacturers. ``We should be working for more
openness, not for more restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Other critics of the measure insist the higher prices will have
a chilling effect on the roughly 2 million Mexican immigrants who
live in the United States and drive back every year for visits at
Christmas and Easter, Mexico's most family-centered holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tradition for us to visit our relatives every
Christmas,'' said Rogelio Rivas, 52, an El Paso resident who
planned to drive his wife, three children, and four grandchildren
to the northern Mexican city of Torreon, about 700 miles away.
``But with this fee, we won't all be able to go. Or maybe instead
of visiting every year, we only do it every two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Some border region leaders, like Allen, say the agency's
decision is one of a series of steps taken by the US and Mexican
governments lately that have hurt local trade. Earlier this year,
the Mexican officials announced a steep increase in the price of
tourist visas.
</P>
<P>
   Other local leaders, meanwhile, complain of hours-long backups
at the international bridges for people and cargo entering the
United States because there are not enough immigration and customs
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Ministry officials postponed the start of the car
deposit program because of the backlash created on both sides of
the border, but the agency says the new deposit is required by law,
and that it has done all it can to make the payment as easy as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The deposits, for example, are less for older cars _ about $400
for cars built before 1994. They are refundable, returned once the
car crosses back to the US side. And the deposits can be charged.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to stemming the flow of the illegally imported cars,
the measure was needed to curb the traffic in stolen vehicles.
Mexican citizens often turn to this black market to buy cars _
knows as ``chocolates'' _ to avoid paying expensive excise taxes
that are charged on cars purchased domestically. Of the 14 million
cars in Mexico, an estimated 1.5 million were brought in illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal cars mean lost revenue for the government. The 14
million cars that are legally registered in the country, for
instance, produce $800 million in tax funds every year. Officials
also said that allowing more chocolates into the country threatens
Mexico's automotive sector.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than increase the fees and threaten the flow of
tourists and businesses along the border, Elizondo said, officials
in Mexico City should let local governments create their own
programs to stop the illegal vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Under a project begun in Ciudad Juarez in January, local police
and officials have identified and recovered 1,916 illegal cars.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Woods, general manager of Sanborn's Mexico Auto Insurance,
one of the largest underwriters of auto insurance policies for
motorists traveling in Mexico, said many tourists have taken their
vacations earlier than planned to avoid the higher deposits, which
go into effect on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Woods also predicts the biggest loser in the car-deposit rule
will be Mexico, where tourism by car fell 27 percent from 1997 to
1998. Woods attributed that decline to negative publicity about
safety in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now with this on top of everything else, it doesn't look good
for Mexican tourism,'' Woods said of the new deposit.

 UNDATED: ... he says.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   History had always interested Schama _ he wrote a 12-page
illustrated ``History of the Royal Navy'' when he was 9 _ and at
Cambridge he made it his profession. ``He was the most exciting
pupil one is ever likely to have,'' says Plumb _ no small praise
from a man who has been an academic for six decades. Schama became
a lecturer at Oxford in 1976 and a year later published his first
book, ``Patriots and Liberators: Revolution in the Netherlands
1780-1813.''
</P>
<P>
   Even writing on something so seemingly arcane, Schama managed to
grace his narrative with a beguiling array of offbeat characters
and odd bits of social history. His next book, ``Two Rothschilds
and the Land of Israel'' (1978), is his least typical _ in
stylistic restraint as well as subject matter _ but with ``The
Embarrassment of Riches: An Interpretation of Dutch Culture in the
Golden Age'' (1987), Schama came into his own. It was a great
critical success and actually managed to sneak onto the bestseller
list, as did Schama's next book, ``Citizens: A Chronicle of the
French Revolution'' (1989). He described that book as ``an exercise
in animated description,'' words that apply equally to its
predecessor. Both books drew criticism from specialists, but their
author's popular reputation was made. Emboldened by success and
ever eager to test the limits of the discipline, Schama even tried
his hand at fictionalizing history, in ``Dead Certainties'' (1991).
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence, perhaps, that Schama wrote all three books
after coming to the United States. The tight little world of
English academe never knew quite what to make of such ``a disturber
of lazily repeated formulae'' (a phrase Schama applies to Rembrandt
that might double as autobiography). ``He aroused enmity as well as
good will, of course,'' Plumb sighs. Schama found Harvard, where he
arrived in 1980, and then Columbia, where he has taught since 1993,
more hospitable than Oxbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Schama usually lives in Westchester County, north of New York,
with his wife, Virginia E. Papaioannou, a professor of genetics at
Columbia, and their two children: Chloe, 16, and Gabriel, 14. At
present, though, he and his family are in England, where he's
immersed in a 16-part BBC series, to be broadcast next fall, called
``Britain: A Television History.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a series on British history _ of any kind.
I soon found out why: The weather, it's called! . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Has (the filming) been fantastic fun? Absolutely, not a minute
of boredom. You know, the odd thing is, I've always said I could
only work on a foreign culture _ Holland, France, and so on. Of
course, Britain isn't a foreign culture, but its idiosyncrasies
past and present I no longer take for granted. I do have the eye of
a visitor now.''
</P>
<P>
   The series is Schama's biggest opportunity yet to reach an
audience beyond academe (``There is a slight proselytizing aspect
to it,'' he says with a barely suppressed smile), and that audience
can expect a goodly helping of exotica. ``It's all location stuff,
really, and artifacts as well, lovely things,'' he explains.
``Someone phoned me up and said, `Simon, did you know' _ which I
certainly didn't! _ `that the Westminster Abbey Museum has the
underthings they took off of Queen Elizabeth I when she died in
1603?'. . . I knew, instantly, the film has to start with very,
very tight shots of the stitching.''
</P>
<P>
   A book will accompany the series (it's a tribute to Schama's
transatlantic buzz-straddling that the publisher will be Tina
Brown's imprint, Talk Miramax Books). Then he returns to his
students at Columbia, where he holds a university professorship,
which means he can teach in any department he chooses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shameless eclecticism has been my only methodological guide,''
he writes in ``The Embarrassment of Riches,'' a sentence applicable
to most of his books. But if he ever did find himself struck with
shame, what's the one field he would limit himself to?
</P>
<P>
   Schama does not hesitate. ``Cooking. I love cooking.'' Told he
must choose an academic discipline, he grimaces and then makes sure
his selection leaves him ample wiggle room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art history, because . . . such a lot of human experience I
care about is embedded in it. Not just pictures. It would have to
be an art history, very much as in the 19th century, in Vienna,
about tapestry weaving and furniture making and crude prints and
ancient forms of pornography: the history of images. If that's all
I could do, yes, that would be it.''

HARRIED TRAVELERS CATCH THE WAIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you were listening to the radio Wednesday _ either from your
traffic-jammed car or your onion-scented kitchen _ you may have
heard an announcer say that tolls had been waived on the turnpike
and traffic was being waved through. If you'd been asked to spell
the words, would you have wavered?
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, after a Fast Lane-related slowdown, a reader wrote
to say waived through must be the proper term, since tolls were
being waived. Wave and waive aren't high on the list of troublesome
homonyms, perhaps because they're used in such different contexts,
but our traffic problems may be reviving a dormant confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Such a mix-up would have been highly forgivable in earlier
centuries, when there were two versions of waive in English: The
one still in use today, with Old French origins, and another one,
now obsolete, derived from Old Norse. To add to the muddle, the
now-obsolete waive overlapped in meaning with wave, an Old English
word; both could mean flutter. The absence of standardized spelling
made matters worse: Samuel Johnson, in his famous 1755 dictionary,
chose to spell our waive as wave.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, this is now, and our spelling task is
simpler.
</P>
<P>
   True, we have new ways of using waive since Johnson's time: The
20th century gave us the sporting version (a player is ``waived
through every team in baseball''). But this, like our older uses _
he waived the law through to enactment, the suspect waived his
right to counsel _ describes an abstract process. You can't draw a
picture of someone waiving your parking fines. Waving, however, is
a concrete action, something done by a flag in the breeze or a baby
saying bye-bye.
</P>
<P>
   So if you can see it, it's a wave; if it involves an
institutional process, waive's your word. As in: If our leaders
would waive work and school attendance Thanksgiving week, we could
wave goodbye to traffic problems.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The end of the affair?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One friend recently told another that a woman she knew was
having an affair. ``Is the guy married?'' asked the listener.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' said the tale-teller. ``That's what an affair
means.''
</P>
<P>
   The listener was dubious. Did affair imply adultery, he asked,
or had the meaning only recently shifted in that direction as sex
outside marriage became more acceptable?
</P>
<P>
   If the definition is changing, my 1997 dictionary hasn't caught
up: It defines affair as ``an amorous relationship between two
people not married to each other,'' no adultery required.
</P>
<P>
   Just how ``amorous'' an affair must be it does not say, and that
has surely varied with time and place. As recently as 1910,
novelist E. M. Forster could make a plot turn on the fact that a
kiss, for a respectable young English couple, implied an
engagement; yet Norman Rockwell and his first wife had, as The New
York Times put it, ``a very 1920s marriage in that both had affairs
with others.''
</P>
<P>
   And the fine distinctions in the movie ``Indiscreet'' are worthy
of our recent presidential parsings on the subject of sex: The
(discreet) affair between Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman is
acceptable while he's pretending to have a wife who won't divorce
him. But once his bachelorhood is revealed, he himself is
scandalized by Bergman's teasing suggestion that they carry on as
unmarried lovers.
</P>
<P>
   This is a case that cries out for readers' testimony. Does
anyone speak of affairs today when the principals are unmarried? Or
are the couple an item, having a thing? I've just been instructed
by a college-age daughter in the nomenclature of pairings at her
school _ you progress from seeing each other to dating to being
together to going out _ and college kids can't be the only ones
struggling to define such relationships.
</P>
<P>
   So please tell me, in language appropriate for a family
newspaper, whether you think an affair must include a betrayed
spouse (or even a complicit one), or whether it takes only two to
tango. Include your age, too (not necessarily for publication, but
to clue me in to generational differences).
</P>
<P>
   And if affair is over, in your set, what words have replaced it?
Do you just say they're seeing each other, and guess at (or ask
about) the level of intimacy? If we've decided to change the
definition of affair, our lexicographers shouldn't be the last to
know.

CARROLL VOWS CHANGES TO RIGHT PATRIOTS SHIP

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ ``Coaches live on the edge,'' Patriots coach
Pete Carroll said Monday, but seldom if ever have he and his team
been dangling over such a sharp edge as this. Even if for the third
straight year Carroll has his team at 6-5 over 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Things have unraveled so quickly _ with three straight (and
one-sided) losses to division foes _ that the usual midseason swoon
seems more threatening than in the 1997 and 1998 seasons. In those
years, there was no sense that opposing defenses knew the Patriots'
playbook better than the New England players.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sick time for coaches,'' said Carroll, not to
mention a sick time for Patriot players and a sick time for Patriot
fans. ``It's terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   And those legions of fans calling for his head? No concern, said
Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too late for that,'' he said. ``I've already been through
enough stuff in my coaching career. I've been around guys who've
been . . . uh, scrutinized . . . that it's not going to affect what
I do or how I do things. Like I've told you, that has never been a
factor in how I do this job.''
</P>
<P>
   New England cornerback Steve Israel said, ``We're in a slump
now, a Bad News Bears slump,'' but the Patriots have no time for
slumps to take their natural course. Immediate action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember ever losing three games in a row in my
life,'' said safety Lawyer Milloy, who forgot the three straight
losses in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have indeed lost those three straight games, and
they also lost their offense in the bye-week vacation four weeks
ago. They clearly have lost their confidence, too. A lost season
looms.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, for his part, was little different from his usual
upbeat personality Monday even as he promised changes. The coach
said he was confident in both himself and his team that the many
wrongs of the last three weeks can be righted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly that we can get this fixed,'' said
Carroll. ``I'm very confident in what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches, he said, ``live and die with what goes on. But where
your confidence comes from is knowing what you've been able to do,
what you can do, and trusting you can do that. So, from where I
sit, I feel we can turn it around right now. It's going to be
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, said the coach, his players have not given up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still with it,'' he said. ``I'm not disappointed at
all in their effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll would not be specific about changes, whether they will
be in personnel or game plans, other than to say ``a little of
both.''
</P>
<P>
   As for changes in schemes, Carroll conceded that he should have
acted earlier, as it became clearer to some observers weeks ago
that the New England offense was becoming more and more mired in
quicksand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wished we would have made those changes a little bit
earlier,'' he said. ``But we figured we would have been able to
execute (the offense), and that's why we did what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was practice the offensive plays harder after the dismal
effort against Miami. But after scoring only 7 points Sunday in
Buffalo, Carroll has concluded that the offense needs more than
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team that can't make its third-down conversions, nothing
looks right,'' said Carroll. ``That's the way it looks like. You
don't get to feel the rhythm of the game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the offense has to be revamped.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said he and team owner Robert Kraft talk regularly and,
``since I've been here, I've always received strong support.'' That
support might not be so strong if the Patriots collapse in their
final five games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing it in the way I know best how to do it,'' said
Carroll. ``That's the way I've felt about it any other time in my
career and that's the way I feel about it now.''

SINKING CAUSED BY SMALL LEAKS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ You watch the Patriots' slow demise the
past three weeks and the past three years and you wonder how this
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Little things, not big ones. That's how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   A few of them stared owner Bob Kraft in the face Sunday as he
was packing up his gear in the visiting owner's box at Ralph Wilson
Stadium and walking out on his team before they were finished
staggering to a 17-7 defeat. Walking out while thinking thoughts
that were not happy thoughts even on this Thanksgiving weekend.
</P>
<P>
   One of those things was Chris Carter getting called for
interference when he put his hand in the face of a receiver despite
appearing to be in perfect position to make the play without doing
that. It was another close play not made by someone the team's
brain trust had assured Kraft would fill in ably for Willie Clay
after they exiled Clay two days before training camp rather than
renegotiate his contract down from a salary-cap figure that had
grown too high.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lousy thing to do to a guy who hadn't missed a
practice, let alone a game, since he came to New England. A lousy
way to treat a good soldier and a lousy message to send to a team
that already had too many guys coming in late or not working hard
enough on the days when games are won.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we're a championship team or not has nothing to do
with me being late (to practice),'' said Terry Glenn, who was
benched in the first quarter for that transgression. He didn't
learn that from Willie Clay.
</P>
<P>
   Clay would never be mistaken for Ronnie Lott, but three weeks
ago he quietly moved into the starting lineup in New Orleans,
beating out a man far younger, far faster, far more physically
gifted than he is because Mike Ditka concluded that Clay was a
smarter player who could help his struggling team. Could he not
have helped the struggling team he was already on more? Would he
have missed any more tackles than Carter has or made any fewer
plays? Would he, maybe just once, have put his defense in the right
spot at the right time or maybe put himself in such a spot?
</P>
<P>
   Little things.
</P>
<P>
   Tebucky Jones, whom the Patriots drafted instead of Green Bay's
talented pass-rushing defensive end Vonnie Holliday, was beaten
again in nickel coverage on third down. Beaten twice the week
before in the same circumstances. Beaten after being put where the
men who wanted him insisted he needed to be. Beaten when put in
position to make plays because he is not a cornerback. Wasn't the
day they used a first-round draft pick on him and isn't today _
regardless of what Pete Carroll keeps trying to feed the media _
because his hips don't turn the way they need to turn and that's
not his fault. That's nature's fault, but there's not much Jones
can do about it but be one step short too often at one of the
game's loneliest positions.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, he wasn't even the best safety on the Syracuse team
he was drafted from. His former teammate, Donovan Darius, was taken
well after Jones but has been starting for two years on what is now
statistically the best defense in football, Jacksonville's. They
came out of the same draft. Two safeties. The difference? One is
still playing safety.
</P>
<P>
   Little things.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Gash caught a pass out of the Buffalo backfield Sunday. Tedy
Bruschi was faced with both a gap (inside run) responsibility and
coverage in the flat. That's a difficult spot under the best of
circumstances, and this was not the best of circumstances because
Bills offensive coordinator Joe Pendry had a perfect call on.
</P>
<P>
   With a tight end crossing in front of him and a wide receiver
picking him off while crossing from the other direction, Bruschi
simply had too much traffic to fight through and he couldn't get
where he needed to be to cover a guy who should still be playing
fullback in New England but isn't because Kraft was led to believe
the ultimate team player had turned into a sour clubhouse lawyer
two years ago during a contract dispute that was more about
personalities than money.
</P>
<P>
   He was told Gash was damaged goods, not recovering from a knee
injury that everyone with any experience in such things knew takes
at least a year to come back from. Told he was killing the new
coach in the locker room. Told that despite all Gash had done to
prove otherwise, he was selfish.
</P>
<P>
   After Gash took that pass and slipped out of the hands of Andy
Katzenmoyer for a 31-yard touchdown that finished the Patriots,
here's what a teammate said about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the great leaders on this team,'' Doug Flutie
gushed. ``He keeps his mouth shut, works hard, and motivates guys.
He's got an intensity level about him and does all the dirty
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The malingering, loud-mouthed clubhouse lawyer who couldn't get
along with the new coach in New England goes to Buffalo and gets a
personality transplant? No, he goes to Buffalo and continues to be
what he has always been. What he'd still be in New England if
they'd let him: a Pro Bowl blocking back despite having not carried
the football a single time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Gash does his job so well the Bills coaches give out a weekly
award called the ``Sam Gash.'' It goes to the player who works the
hardest and goes 100 percent on every play. Gash had won it twice
before Sunday. After being handed a game ball, he won it again, in
a place where nobody has a bad thing to say about him.
</P>
<P>
   Little things.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road a piece, Curtis Martin was going over the
1,000-yard mark, rushing for 83 yards in 19 carries for the Jets
against Indianapolis. He has 1,042 yards, which is only about 40
percent more than the Patriots' leading rusher has. He is third in
the NFL in rushing and this is the second straight year he has
rushed for more than 1,000 yards since he left New England after
being branded as too expensive and too injury-prone and on the
downside of his career. Someone in the New England organization
actually produced a computer analysis that said you could find a
back to do what Martin does in the draft with relative ease.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the Patriots are still looking for that guy
when they should be looking for the one with the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Little things.
</P>
<P>
   It is early in the fourth quarter of a game you are trailing,
17-0, because your defense has gotten a couple of bad breaks, but
you have the ball at your opponent's 48-yard line and you're
driving. There is still plenty of time if you can get something
here. It is fourth and 1 and you elect to go for it, but despite
having a quarterback who has sneaked his way to such first downs
five times this year without being stopped, you decide not to let
him try the one run he seems capable of making. Worse, you don't
run at all.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, you put this less-than-mobile quarterback in the
shotgun, virtually screaming out that you're going to throw. The
ball is snapped and seconds later the quarterback is on his back,
sacked for a 13-yard loss. Your defense holds, but when you get the
ball back, you've lost two precious minutes and now every play is a
pass and you go nowhere, and by the time you get the ball back
again and score, there are less than three minutes to play and it's
over. The game and probably the season.
</P>
<P>
   In football, as in most of life, little things add up. You do
enough of them well and the big things take care of themselves. If
you don't, you spend your life at 6-5, fighting to survive from
week to week.
</P>
<P>
   So if you want to know what has happened in Foxborough since the
Patriots made their last trip to the Super Bowl, add up the little
things. Add up all those draft choices you got from the Jets for
Martin and Bill Parcells and remember names such as Sedrick Shaw,
Damon Denson, Chris Floyd, Robert Edwards, and Tony Simmons, and
ask yourself if you got real value for your losses.
</P>
<P>
   Add up someone coming to the conclusion that Chris Canty was a
better cornerback prospect than Sam Madison.
</P>
<P>
   Add up all those offensive linemen you've drafted the past three
years, six of them all together, and ask where they are when your
quarterback is being sacked 13 times in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ask about the little things, and you'll have your answer to the
big question of what's gone wrong in Foxborough.

IN THE MILD, MILD EAST, IT ALL SEEMS TO EVEN OUT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Celtics coach Rick Pitino had the NBA standings in his
hand Monday and was going over the Eastern Conference. After
rattling off all the teams at or around .500, he said, simply,
``We're right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's true. But it's also true of a lot of other teams.
After four weeks of NBA competition, here's what we have in the
East: the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   We have Miami ahead of the pack. We have Chicago chasing the
1972-73 Sixers. We have New Jersey and Washington, two teams
playing horribly. And then we have Everybody Else.
</P>
<P>
   We have 11 teams bunched together, all within four games of each
other. Throw out 5-9 Atlanta and the remaining 10 are all within
three games. Six teams as of Monday were at .500, although 7-7
Indiana and 7-7 New York had games Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets win at home. The Raptors win on the road. The Magic
_ the Magic? _ play the same no matter what the venue. The Knicks
have already played 10 games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's topsy-turvy. All of those teams had better fasten their
seat belts because I think it's going to be a bumpy ride all
year,'' said Chris Wallace, paraphrasing the immortal line from
Bette Davis in ``All About Eve.'' He added, ``I think there's very
little difference between the teams. It's an `on any given night'
type of thing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Orlando. The Magic have won seven games, or seven
more than many figured they'd have won by now. On Sunday night,
they played the Pistons at the Palace of Auburn Hills. They were
coming off a close loss the day before against the Knicks while
Detroit had won seven of nine and was off on Saturday. The Magic
won, easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unsung team in all of this has to be Orlando,'' Wallace
said. ``They tore their house down over the summer and they're
hanging tough. They're there, every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino was asked if he thought one of the Jumbled Ten might
break away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Detroit, and then (Sunday) night, Orlando is up 20
for the entire game. And you think Milwaukee is going to break out
of it and Philly goes in and beats them without (Theo) Ratliff and
(Allen) Iverson. I don't know what to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very close in talent. Very close. I think there
are dominating basketball players and dominating basketball teams.
The San Antonios, the Portlands, the Sacramentos, they're
dominating teams. And Miami. Then, you have everybody else equal in
talent. Some are younger. Some are older. There's great parity.''
</P>
<P>
   And where do the Celtics fit in?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know who we are right now,'' Pitino said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a team that, like the others, has been up and down. The
Celtics have played the fewest road games, and most home games, of
any team in the East. They've had only one game against a team from
the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Those two areas work against them. But, like New York (Patrick
Ewing), Philly (Iverson, Ratliff, Matt Geiger), Cleveland (Zydrunas
Ilgauskas), and New Jersey (Jayson Williams, Kerry Kittles), they
have a player deemed to be important (Danny Fortson) who has missed
a lot of time.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said Monday that while Fortson might return in early
January, he did not expect him to be at full strength for another
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to need a month,'' Pitino said. ``I don't think you
expect a guy eight weeks off to become a great player (right away).
I have not seen that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Marty Conlon, said to be Fortson Insurance, Pitino was
asked Monday how close he was to coming off the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not close,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics finished the month with a 7-7 record, not as
successful as Pitino had hoped, and 6-3 at the FleetCenter, which,
given the level of competition, probably was about where it should
have been. They gave one away on the road (Chicago) and one away at
home (Detroit). They blew one at home (Milwaukee) and on the road
(Atlanta). They won unexpectedly on the road (Toronto) and at home
(Charlotte, New York, Indiana).
</P>
<P>
   They've done this with a rookie starter and with their top-paid
player and captain playing, well, ``nowhere near playing his best
basketball,'' according to the coach. He added, however, that
Antoine Walker wasn't the only one not playing as well as he should
or could.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played well as a team,'' Pitino said. ``But our parts
are not playing well. That's true mostly of this team. I think
it'll come on at the end of the year. Paul (Pierce) is not playing
his (best) basketball . . . Kenny (Anderson) started off good, but
. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The only ones playing great basketball, by himself, are two
people: Adrian (Griffin) and Eric (Williams). I think (the rest)
are going to come on and play better basketball, especially at the
defensive end. Defense is our Achilles' heel right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The schedule, their November ally, is about to turn against
them. The Celtics have to play the Sixers, Knicks, Cavs, Spurs,
Rockets, Clippers, Kings, and Nuggets on the road in December. But
they also get the Sixers without Iverson and the Knicks without
Ewing (and maybe Larry Johnson, too). And among their home visitors
in the month are Miami (next up, this Friday), the Jazz, and the
Lakers.

   So, Korn thinks it has ``Issues''? Here are some issues for you:
</P>
<P>
   After seven years of intellectual foreplay and incessant
teasing, Mulder and Scully on Fox's ``The X-Files'' finally
smooched. Well, was it good for you? Was it everything you've
waited for? I dunno _ somehow, I felt a little unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's hokey, inexplicably popular game show for dummies, ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' recently claimed seven of the top 10
slots for the week's most-watched television shows. An average of
24 million viewers tuned in to watch contestants who would be left
for dead on any installment of ``Jeopardy.'' Yes indeedy, we get
the TV shows we deserve. And speaking of ``Millionaire,'' isn't
Regis Philbin just the luckiest white man in show biz? (For
luckiest black man in show biz, see Will Smith.)
</P>
<P>
   And staying on the tube tip, back in the 1950s, ``I Love Lucy''
packed it in after six seasons. In the 1970s, the cast of ``The
Mary Tyler Moore Show'' sang ``It's a Long Way to Tipperary'' and
walked away after seven sparkling years. Neither classic comedy
stayed on to the point where the seams began to show; hence we have
memories of both programs ending at the top of their game. To wit,
I'm proposing a five-year statute of limitations for TV shows,
especially sitcoms _ sort of an expiration date before they go
stale and sour. No comedy, regardless of how fresh and clever it
may be at the beginning, can sustain itself for much longer than a
half-decade. Think of shows like ``All in the Family'' (1971-79),
``Cheers'' (1982-93), ``The Cosby Show'' (1984-92), and
``Seinfeld'' (1990-98), all of which limped to their respective
finish lines. The latest casualty seems to be NBC's ``Frasier''
(1993-??), which had been the best comedy on television for a good
chunk of the '90s. Now the show seems tired and redundant. How much
more innuendo can we take between Niles and Daphne? How many more
jokes are there to be made about Roz's promiscuity or Frasier's
inability to sustain a relationship? And is Martin's hip better by
now? Time to hang it up, gang. The show is so over, it hurts.

   What with all the gats and gangstas still clogging up hip-hop,
it's easy to forget that rap used to have a sense of humor. After
all, the genre's first hit, 1979's ``Rapper's Delight'' by
Sugarhill Gang, concerned itself with nothing more lethal than a
lousy meal of soggy macaroni, mushed peas, and woodlike chicken
served by your best friend's mama. To remind all of us of the humor
within hip-hop, its fans, and practitioners, there's ``ego trip's
Book of Rap Lists,'' a spanking-new compilation by the editors of
the irreverent (and all-too-irregular) rap 'zine ego trip. It's
arguably the funniest book of the year, and certainly one of the
best ever about hip-hop. There are lots of factual lists _ the
first recorded rap song was ``King Tim III (Personality Jock)'' by
Fatback _ but many of the lists are just plain hilarious, the
twisted flotsam of true hip-hop heads. A wee sampling:

PUTTING MUSIC TO THE MOVIES: A CHANGE OF ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 16 years as half of the enchanting and ethereal
world-music-and-beyond group Dead Can Dance, Lisa Gerrard finds
herself in a new role: soundtrack artist. She has been working with
Michael Mann and Ridley Scott, two of the top directors when it
comes to incorporating music in film. Gerrard and collaborator
Pieter Bourke composed and/or played much of the score for Mann's
``The Insider,'' the tobacco-whistleblower drama out now; and
Gerrard is at work with Hans Zimmer in Los Angeles on an upcoming
Scott film, ``Gladiator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They chose me,'' Gerrard says, barely suppressing a pinch-me
feeling of astonishment. ``I feel like I am at school at the
moment, I am learning so much. Just working with Michael was really
a huge education.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourke and Gerrard ``wrote nearly 100 pieces, and now working
with this project there is a different education being picked up.
So I feel very much at the moment I am a part of an apprenticeship,
and I am very fortunate because I am working. I forget the
magnitude of these projects. It is not possible for me to think
about the external sort of things; the things that I must think
about are what the characters are going through.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gerrard speaks about magnitude, she's talking about these
films' potential for worldwide reach. As acclaimed as Dead Can
Dance was, and as fervent is its fan base, its music is unlikely to
reach as many people as films do.
</P>
<P>
   The haunting, exotic score for ``The Insider'' is particularly
effective. It's not an action movie, so the Bourke and Gerrard are
not providing a soundtrack for car chases and gunplay. A lot of
``The Insider'' deals with the action and reaction of the
characters, as well as their interior landscapes. The music _
atmospheric and polyrhythmic, with Gerrard sometimes contributing
chantlike vocals _ adds an otherworldliness, often amplifying
Russell Crowe's character's confusion and frustration as
executive-turned-secret-spiller Jeffrey Wigand.
</P>
<P>
   Gerrard is fascinated by the depth and detail in Mann's film.
``There is one shot of Jeffrey and his wife,'' Gerrard says, ``and
she is sitting on the couch.'' Al Pacino's character, CBS producer
Lowell Bergman, calls. ``She answers the phone and says, `He does
not care to talk to you,' and she puts the phone down. There are
these curtains in the back of that shot that look like concrete;
they are cold, and unmoving, fabric that looks like it could be
hosed down. It is this sort of chiseling and sculpting that
surrounds this incredibly fragile fabric that is the human
consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mann ``allows you, with the music, to take you further and
further and further into a greater understanding of what the human
being is. I think that is the important thing about his films: You
are touched by this man's work, and he can take it to the most
brutal situations, and he will find a human factor in each, and
unlock that for you. And he unlocks that with music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlock'' is a word Gerrard uses frequently in discussing the
work. That is the key, she suggests, in making what she does mesh
with, or enhance, what is happening on screen.
</P>
<P>
   As such, she says, she strives to unlock ``the multidimensional
possibilities to arrive at the stories or psychology the director
wants to conjure up.'' On ``The Insider,'' her task was to unlock
``the internal things that he is experiencing, his memory. I sort
of went through his struggle with his conscience, his humiliation
of losing his work, and the losing of his family, deciding to tell
the truth, taking risks, being put under the most incredible
pressure a human being can be put under, having a nervous
breakdown, losing everything, his wife and his children.''
</P>
<P>
   Soundtracks these days, of course, can mean big business in the
record stores, as many a movie is chockablock with the
flavor-of-the-week act. (Say hello to 'N Sync and Christina
Aguilera.) If people choose to buy ``The Insider'' soundtrack,
they'll be getting something entirely different, something not at
all related to the notion of a pop hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do film music, we do music for film,'' Gerrard says.
``We write pieces of music and then break them down so that they
work with the images, painting in bits and pieces until the piece
is written. Then we start editing, and holding things back, so the
pieces of music work in their own right. I can't just paint on
shadow; I have to have the atmosphere and something that is
abstract that points toward something else in the piece of music
first. And then you show that to the director and they might say,
`It doesn't affect me emotionally' or `Yes, it does affect me
emotionally.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gerrard occasionally gets lost in a thicket of words _ she'll
pause and ask, ``Was that too convoluted?'' _ but clearly she is
excited about her new life. Dead Can Dance dissolved amicably, by
mutual agreement _ she thinks. It just kind of happened. Her former
partner, Brendan Perry, has released his first solo album, ``Eye of
the Hunter,'' and recently played a compelling concert in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important part of being in Dead Can Dance for me were
the concerts,'' says Gerrard, ``and they were my liberation period,
where I was liberated by the sense that can be arrived at through
the most simple music.'' The breakup?
</P>
<P>
   ``What reasons do we have to have? Things got to a point where .
. . it's as simple as this: When you want to go down a road, the
two of you, and you want to go together, and you get to a point
where one thinks that the way you're going down the road isn't
right, and the other thinks it's right, and you can't go down the
road anymore, you have to part for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The telepathic communication they once shared was dissipating,
she says, and, ``we could not step forward confidently, either of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a liberating feeling,'' she says, of her split. ``I
mean of course it is sad, too, but we worked together for 16 years
and we learned so many things. I learned so much from Brendan. Even
in the work I am doing now, I am constantly sort of pillaging
things, his approaches and the way he would go about doing things.
His dedication and his capacity to work _ that influenced me,
because I am extremely dedicated.''
</P>
<P>
   She's happy being a free agent, working with different people on
various projects. ``I will never connect myself with someone
permanently again,'' she says. ``I think it would be difficult now,
it would stunt the growth _ to just remain with one other person.''
</P>
<P>
   Athough Gerrard is confident in her work, she remains humble.
``I was surprised when I got this call about `Gladiator.' I did not
expect any work to come, and I know that Michael (Mann) has this
completely different opinion, and says, `You are going to get all
of these offers.' But you never really believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   What is ``Gladiator'' about? ``It goes from the most fragile
poetry to the deepest wound,'' Gerrard says. ``It is an
extraordinary piece of work.''

JEFFREY ARCHER'S CHARMED CHAPTER COMES TO A CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Jeffrey Archer's novels have made him a millionaire,
but many people believe his autobiography would be far more
interesting than any of the political potboilers he's dreamed up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many also believe that the 59-year-old Archer could never
write what would be his best book because he is incapable of
telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's propensity for lying caught up to him last weekend when
he was forced to withdraw as the Conservative Party's candidate for
mayor of London. Archer had unwittingly admitted asking a friend to
lie for him in a libel case he brought in 1987 against a newspaper
that claimed he had had sex with a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   His career and the reputation he had guarded so fiercely with a
sharp tongue and a battery of lawsuits now lies in ruins, destroyed
by a tale of debauchery, betrayal, high living, and low morals that
would fit readily in the plot line of one of his novels.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of his undeniable charisma and a stable of
influential friends, Archer has survived countless scrapes, and in
1992 he was appointed to the House of Lords, an honor usually
reserved for those with less controversial backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   But now Archer faces the prospect of jail if a police
investigation substantiates the accusation of witness tampering,
even though the potential witness never did lie under oath, because
his testimony wasn't needed.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, Ted Francis, is an old friend of Archer's. A
socialist who said he didn't want to see Archer become mayor,
Francis secretly recorded Archer recalling how he had asked Francis
to provide him with an alibi in the 1987 libel case.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Archer's political career, which stretches
back 30 years to his election to Parliament, appears to be over.
William Hague, the Tory leader who last month extolled Archer as a
man of ``probity and integrity,'' turned around this week and
banished him, saying ``this is the end of politics for Jeffrey
Archer.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer's sudden, scandalous withdrawal from politics will
deprive Britain of one of its most flamboyant characters, and the
Tories of a candidate whom many believed capable of becoming mayor
of one of the world's biggest cities. Had he been elected next May,
he would instantly have become a major international figure. It was
a pedestal he openly coveted, spending more than $1 million of his
own money in that pursuit over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Archer has been the rare breed of Conservative who straddled the
world of politics and pop celebrity. Parties at his 10th-floor
apartment on the Embankment overlooking the River Thames serve up
Krug champagne, shepherd's pie, and an eclectic mix of the famous,
the near-famous, and the notorious.
</P>
<P>
   Born poor, Archer is a self-made social climber who spent
lavishly on the finer things in life. He has what the late Boston
Globe columnist George Frazier called ``duende.'' When first-time
guests at his parties ask for directions to the bathroom, he
invariably says, ``Go straight past the Picasso, take a left at the
Matisse.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also been an inveterate fund-raiser. He first came to
public prominence in Britain in 1963 by persuading the Beatles to
back a campaign against world hunger, and has raised millions for
Oxfam and Kurdish refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his ability to survive extraordinary, repeated
attacks on his character and reputation that set him apart. Like
Bill Clinton, Archer has risen from the dead so many times that
there remains this week a small cadre of friends and even enemies
who refuse to write his political obituary. Also like Clinton,
Archer got into trouble over a woman named Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Crick, a journalist for the BBC who four years ago wrote
an unauthorized biography of Archer called ``Stranger Than
Fiction,'' called him a compulsive, pathological liar. He found
that Archer had falsified his academic records to get into Oxford
University.
</P>
<P>
   Archer was an accomplished sprinter, and the BBC recently aired
some archive film in which Archer was shown jumping the starter's
pistol three successive times in one race. Under the rules, two
false starts mean automatic disqualification. But in an episode
that was a portent of the charmed life that would follow, Archer
was allowed to run the race.
</P>
<P>
   Crick said Archer lied about things little and big, even when
there was no real need to lie. He listed himself on his 1966
marriage certificate as a research assistant _ needlessly, Crick
said. Archer described his father as a senior British Army officer
who was decorated for valor. Crick found that that was also made
up, that Archer's father was a con man and bigamist who was sought
by police in Britain, Canada, and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, a brush with bankruptcy showed both Archer's poor
judgment and an uncanny ability to reinvent himself. After
investing $700,000 in a fraudulent Canadian industrial cleaning
company, Archer was forced to resign his seat in Parliament. Then,
while in Toronto trying to sort out the mess, he was arrested for
shoplifting suits from a department store. The charges were later
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   But two years later, Archer reinvented himself, publishing his
first novel, ``Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less.'' Borrowing a
line from the book's villain, Archer had managed to ``turn disaster
into triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   While many critics panned his books, the public bought them in
huge numbers.
</P>
<P>
   An entertaining raconteur, he began making a name for himself in
London social circles. His parties began attracting the likes of
Frank Bruno, the heavyweight boxer, as well as media and political
heavyweights from David Frost to Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   By 1985, Archer's political rehabilitation, necessitated by his
imprudent investments, was complete, and he was appointed vice
chairman of the Conservative Party. But in September of the very
next year, he got caught up in the scandal that would eventually
destroy him.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's carefully cultivated image portrayed him as a family
man devoted to his wife, Mary, and their two sons, but two
scandal-mongering tabloids learned that Archer was involved with a
prostitute named Monica Coghlan. The News of the World reported
that Archer gave her $3,200 to leave the country. The Daily Star
didn't resort to innuendo, saying flat out that Archer had sex with
Coghlan in a seedy London hotel.

 LONDON: ... London hotel.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The libel case Archer brought against The Daily Star was the
most sensational of the decade. Archer maintained that he had never
met Coghlan but had sent a friend to give her money after she
called him and said she was in trouble. He also maintained that at
the time Coghlan said she was having sex with him, he was having
dinner at Le Caprice, one of London's finest restaurants, with his
literary editor and two other friends.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Archer, an academic at Cambridge University, testified on
her husband's behalf. The judge was impressed. In his instructions
to the jury, the judge spoke of her ``elegance.'' The judge
practically implored the jury to find in Archer's favor, asking
jurors in his instructions to them, ``Is he in need of cold,
unloving, rubber-insulated sex in a seedy hotel round about quarter
to one on a Tuesday morning after an evening at Le Caprice?''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not, the jury decided, awarding Archer a then-record
$800,000. The News of the World settled out of court for a fraction
of that. But his admission that he had given Coghlan money forced
him to resign as the Tories' deputy chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, he remained a political player without portfolio, and
in 1992 then-prime minister John Major rewarded him with a life
peerage. Archer courted political writers, inviting them to his
soirees and flattering them. But he was infamous for waking those
same scribes at dawn to berate them if they had written anything
unflattering about him.
</P>
<P>
   And there was always something unflattering being written about
Archer, particularly in the left-wing press. He was, to liberals,
the bete noire of politics. His rags-to-riches story and ability to
appeal to working-class people, the kind who used to vote for
Thatcher, struck fear in the heart of liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Archer was conscious of his unlikely popularity with ordinary
people. Earlier this month, he complained to The Daily Telegraph
about its practice of referring to him as Lord Archer instead of as
Jeffrey Archer. He said he wanted his first name used in future
reports so as not to alienate ``the common man.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some Tories who loathed Archer, seeing him as a rogue
who would only bring the party into disrepute. But many others saw
him as a rare Conservative, someone who socialized with the rich
but appealed to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Tebbit, a former Tory Cabinet minister, put it, ``He
gave the party dash and style.''
</P>
<P>
   While Archer's brushes with notoriety would have spelled exile
for just about anyone else, his defenders included the last three
Tory party leaders, Thatcher, John Major, and Hague.
</P>
<P>
   He was seen as something that most Tories have not been of late:
electable. Last year, when it became apparent that Archer would
emerge as a candidate for mayor of London, Crick, the biographer,
offered to brief Hague, an Oxford classmate, on at least a
half-dozen cases of Archer's unethical behavior that, if brought to
light, could embarrass the Conservatives. The offer was spurned,
and last month party activists voted 15,716 to 6,350 to make Archer
their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that he was caught in a sting that could easily fill
a chapter of one of his novels. Francis, an old friend, went to the
News of the World, saying he was willing to betray Archer rather
than see him become mayor. Francis, a self-described socialist, has
said Archer had once humiliated him in front of a woman, but
insists his real motive was to deny Archer the mayoralty.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid got Francis to call Archer, claiming that someone
had learned about their concocted alibi in 1987. As a tape recorder
whirred, Archer recounted the whole affair. The newspaper showed
him the transcripts, and Archer pulled out of the mayor's race on
Saturday, just hours before the presses started to roll.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Star also wants back the money, now more than $5
million with interest and legal costs, that Archer won in the libel
trial.
</P>
<P>
   According to Francis, Archer asked him to say he was having
dinner with Archer at the time the author was actually dining with
Adrina Colquhoun, his former personal assistant. Archer's wife, not
to mention Thatcher, had told him to stop seeing Colquhoun.
</P>
<P>
   Francis was paid more than $30,000 by the tabloid for his help.
But his publicist, Max Clifford, said Francis could have commanded
five to ten times that amount if money were his motive.
</P>
<P>
   For the past week, Archer has been holed up in his country
estate, the Old Vicarage in Grantchester. His friends say he is
writing letters of apology.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, he is not without influential supporters. Fay Weldon,
the writer, said that what Archer did in 1987 is irrelevant to
running for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``All politicians lie,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephan Shakespeare, Archer's friend, said the novelist is a
victim of snobbery.
</P>
<P>
   But it was another Shakespeare, in ``Richard II,'' quoted by
Archer's lawyer at the opening of the 1987 libel trial, who paid
homage to something Archer can never regain:
</P>
<P>
   ``The purest treasure mortal times afford is spotless
reputation.''

A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GORE, BRADLEY? TRY MEDICAID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ Just by plucking two states out of the air _ say,
Iowa and New Hampshire _ you can understand why the Bill Bradley-Al
Gore argument over health care is not about nothing, especially
where the most vulnerable are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Medicaid, the safety net that is there for everyone,
there are more than 300,000 beneficiaries in the first caucus state
and more than 100,000 in the first primary state. In fact,
everybody has a stake in Medicaid, whether they think of themselves
as health care consumers, taxpayers, nursing home residents, or the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore wants to take Medicaid and build on it,
working through the states to add people and improve coverage as a
major means of slashing into the number of Americans with no access
to affordable health care and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator wants to take a wrecking ball to
the whole system. Bradley might be onto something _ if he were
offering something better, but he's not. Instead, he's offering the
snake oil of vouchers to those for whom Medicaid means basic health
care services (more than 30 percent of the live births in Iowa and
more than a quarter of the live births in New Hampshire, for
example).
</P>
<P>
   For the people who have access to long-term care under Medicaid,
including the disabled and the elderly in nursing homes, he's
offering dependence on the rarely tender mercies and typically
stingy budgets of state governments in return for a federal
assumption of the portion of Medicaid that serves the needy.
</P>
<P>
   For three months Bradley has had a chance to lead a national
dialogue about health care, to build on the promising notions he
first floated in an effort to move the country toward genuinely
universal coverage at responsible cost.
</P>
<P>
   And he's blown it. By sticking to proposals that have huge holes
in them, Bradley has made the prospect of change a threat to
everyone, whether they're currently covered or not. He likes to
disparage Gore as ``timid'' and incremental, but the vice president
has ideas than can make the system better by a mile.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's vouchers make the case. At first, his proposal offered
to pay the entire premium for all adults below the poverty line
(via a refundable tax credit paid in advance) to get insurance
either through their workplace or by making the federal employees
system available to all. But when cost concerns were raised,
Bradley shifted and said the benefit would be capped.
</P>
<P>
   For a single adult with income at the poverty line, the
insurance premium cap would be $1,800 a year.
</P>
<P>
   What can you get for $1,800? Next to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the scores of choices available in the model system for
federal workers, fully 95 percent cost more than that; in fact,
well over half cost more than than $2,400 a year. The choice most
frequently made by workers _ standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield _
costs more than $2,830. In fact, if you browse the Bradley
campaign's Web site, you will find the notation that the average
cost of an individual option under the federal plan is more than
$3,300.
</P>
<P>
   This is worse than snake oil. Keep in mind that for more than
220,000 kids and adults in Iowa and more than 75,000 in New
Hampshire, this is life itself.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley offers an even lousier deal to the disabled. In the case
of AIDS patients, for example, fully half currently receive care
under Medicaid. For them, $1,800 isn't even peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley response is a suggestion that assigned risk pools in
a universally expanded federal employee system would provide
adequate protection and care. In a pig's eye; in fact, this would
be just one way that system could be overloaded with desperate
people, sending costs and premiums through the roof for everyone.
For the disabled, the answer is improved Medicaid, not false
promises with huge hidden costs.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid also funds the care of two out of every three residents
of nursing homes. It pays half of all these rapidly increasing
costs, which average $41,000 a year; and it pays two of every five
dollars spent on long-term care. More than that, after hard-fought
political battles, Medicaid offers quality-control regulations, not
to mention other rules that keep the relatives of patients from
having to spend themselves into poverty to be eligible for
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   That is why no governor in his right minds _ and that includes
Democrats Tom Vilsack in Iowa and Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire _
has jumped to endorse a scheme that would turn this ticking fiscal
time bomb over to the states.
</P>
<P>
   To Bradley this is all scare tactics, politics as usual,
unworthy of his lofty, high-concept, principled discussion of the
great issues of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Baloney. What Medicaid shows, what broader discussion of health
insurance has already shown is simple. Bradley is wrong and Gore is
right.

MOBILIZING AGAINST ARTHRITIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Veterinarians have prescribed it for years for high-priced polo
ponies and creaky old dogs. More recently, it's been hyped as a
``cure'' for human arthritis. But a dietary supplement called
glucosamine had been dismissed as quackery by many mainstream
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month a respectable long-term European study on
glucosamine won a prominent place on the program of the American
College of Rheumatology meetings in Boston. And on September 30,
the National Institutes of Health announced it will launch a $6.6
million study of glucosamine and a similar supplement called
chondroitin, one of the most expensive clinical trials ever
conducted of any ``alternative'' therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But glucosamine and chondroitin are not the only hot new areas
in arthritis. Researchers are paying respectful attention to
acupuncture, tai chi, stinging nettle (it may cut down on the need
for conventional painkillers), and other complementary therapies.
</P>
<P>
   They're also excited about new science-based approaches such as
cox-2 inhibitors (already on the market) and metalloprotease
inhibitors (still experimental). Arthritis researchers say they're
finally beginning to understand how to attack the most common form
of the disabling disease, called osteoarthritis _ the deterioration
of the cartilage that cushions each joint, generally causing
symptoms after age 45.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 23 million Americans suffer from osteoarthritis _ one
in every eight adults. (Another 2.1 million have rheumatoid
arthritis, an autoimmune disease that strikes younger adults,
usually women.) As the baby boomers enter the osteoarthritis-prone
years, the number of sufferers will swell.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing except heart disease causes more disability, and no
disease robs more people of their ability to walk, climb stairs,
and even do something as simple as rise from a sitting position.
Fortunately, ``there's a lot of progress in osteoarthritis,'' says
rheumatologist David T. Felson of Boston University School of
Medicine. ``The emerging paradigm is that this is a disease that
needs to be treated with multiple approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes alternative treatments. Even before the NIH study
is off the drawing boards, leading US arthritis specialists are
recommending glucosamine to their patients _ not as a cure, but as
something that reduces pain in some people and may (or may not)
retard the progress of the disease, depending on whether the
European study results can be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try it for 30 days,'' Boston University rheumatologist David
T. Felson told 62-year-old Maureen Palmer last week at Boston
Veterans Affairs Medical Center, where she is participating in a BU
study of osteoarthritis. ``I'm putting all my patients on this
stuff. It's completely safe, and it's worth trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, a fifth-grade schoolteacher with a painful right knee,
says her primary care doctor was skeptical of glucosamine when she
asked about it. ``Now I think I'll give it a try,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists' open-mindedness about alternative therapies is
underscored by a new 286-page ``Guide to Alternative Therapies''
published by the Arthritis Foundation, a nonprofit research and
service organization. The guide sorts through the scientific
evidence (or lack thereof) on 80 arthritis nostrums and ``healing
systems,'' from Ayurveda and qi gong to copper bracelets and
Thunder God Vine.
</P>
<P>
   The Arthritis Foundation undertook the project because it was
getting 5,000 telephone queries a month about alternative
therapies. ``We had no position except `we don't know,' '' says Dr.
William J. Arnold, who chaired the foundation's task force on
alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not all arthritis specialists are receptive to
alternative therapies. ``To some extent the Arthritis Foundation
has given credibility to a lot of things that don't deserve it,''
complains Dr. Donald M. Marcus, a Houston rheumatologist.
</P>
<P>
   Despite lingering skepticism among their colleagues, many
arthritis specialists see their field as an emerging model for the
marriage of scientific and complementary approaches. On the
scientific side, leading researchers paint an expansive picture of
the future of osteoarthritis treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be able to treat the pain better with safer
agents. In the next decade, if not sooner, we'll be able to give
you things that will slow the disease,'' says Dr. Roland D.
Moskowitz of Case Western Reserve University of Cleveland. ``And
we're going to able to resurface joints with biological materials,
not only to treat the disease but to repair the damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Some new approaches come from surprising directions. For
instance, there's some evidence that a common antibiotic may slow
joint damage or even prevent osteoarthritis. Dr. Kenneth D. Brandt
of the University of Indiana is overseeing a large federally
sponsored trial of doxycycline, a synthetic version of the
antibiotic tetracycline, in people with osteoarthritis or at high
risk for the disease. Tetracyclines inhibit enzymes that soften and
break down cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, researchers thought that osteoarthritis was
simply a matter of wear and tear, a grinding down of the slick,
elastic cartilage that cushions and lubricates the ends of all
bones.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanical forces certainly play a role, especially in
initiating the damage. Earlier injury, whether from athletics or
repetitive overuse in the workplace, increases the risk for later
arthritis by three- to six-fold. Maureen Palmer's knee arthritis is
the price she's paying for a ski injury nearly 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With each step, weight-bearing joints must bear a force
equivalent to up to six times total body weight. Thus, it makes
sense that there's a strong link between osteoarthritis and excess
weight. Overweight individuals have four to five times the risk of
osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   But mechanical forces do not totally explain osteoarthritis.
Overweight individuals have a higher risk of arthritis in the hands
too, suggesting that obesity exerts a systemic effect. Inheritance
plays a role too, especially in arthritis of the hand. So do
hormones, since women's risk of the disease rises sharply after
menopause, when estrogen levels decrease sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Diet also affects osteoarthritis, especially once the process
has begun. Researchers think this may be due in part to the effects
on cartilage from oxidation _ a central mechanism of age-related
tissue damage.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of participants in the well-known Framingham Heart
Study, Felson's group found those with the highest dietary intake
of vitamin C, an antioxidant, had one-third the risk of developing
knee pain from arthritis compared to individuals with the lowest
vitamin C levels. Vitamin C may also facilitate cartilage repair.
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin E, another antioxidant, apparently has less effect on
the progression of arthritis, but its anti-inflammatory effects may
explain why some studies suggest vitamin E supplements may ease
pain in some patients.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the best advice specialists can offer to osteoarthritis
sufferers is to attack the disease with a combination of lifestyle,
medical, and dietary interventions _ and ultimately, joint
replacement surgery when all else fails.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list are weight loss and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a little weight loss can make a difference,'' says
Brandt, the Indiana arthritis specialist. Framingham data show that
a weight loss of 11 pounds in women of medium height reduced the
risk of painful knee arthritis by half.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise _ especially gentle and progressive resistance exercise
that strengthens leg muscles _ is getting increased attention among
arthritis researchers. This doesn't mean going to a gym and working
out like Schwarzenegger; cheap ankle weights or elastic bands, used
faithfully at home to do leg-lifting exercises, will do the trick.
``It takes very little physical activity to improve fitness,'' says
Brandt. ``Even the very elderly can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that stronger leg muscles brace the knee and hip
joints, reducing the wobble that comes with age-related loosening
of ligaments. Increased joint stability in turn protects cartilage
from the cycle of injury, enzymatic breakdown, and inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   A Tufts University study presented at the Boston rheumatology
meeting showed a home exercise regimen improved leg strength by 71
percent and reduced arthritic knee pain by 36 percent. A larger
exercise study from England showed similar improvements in knee
pain and physical function.
</P>
<P>
   When painkillers are necessary, doctors often advise the old
standby acetaminophen (Tylenol or generic brands) if inflammation
is not an issue, although users should be cautious about combining
this drug with alcohol to avoid liver damage. To relieve both pain
and inflammation, the standard recommendation has been
non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), but chronic use of
NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and naproxen can erode the stomach lining
and cause potentially dangerous bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   The new cox-2 inhibitors celecoxib (Celebrex) and rofecoxib
(Vioxx) appear to avoid this problem entirely while maintaining
equal efficacy against osteoarthritis pain and inflammation,
according to two studies published last week in the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that Celebrex has vaulted into first place
among prescription painkillers. But Celebrex and Vioxx cost from
$90 to $120 a month, which can be prohibitive for many people,
especially if they have little or no prescription drug coverage.
Eventually, Moskowitz thinks, ``more cox-2 inhibitors will come out
and the price will come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever improvements emerge in medical therapy _ conventional
or alternative _ many osteoarthritis patients will eventually run
out of stop-gap options. For them, the ultimate treatment is an
artificial knee or hip. ``Total knee and hip replacement have
totally revolutionized arthritis treatment, in terms of keeping
people walking and off crutches,'' Moskowitz says. ``When patients
say, `Doc, this is really interfering with my lifestyle and the
medicines aren't helping anymore,' it's appropriate to take the
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Ercoline, 64, is glad he did. After conventional medicine
and acupuncture no longer relieved the excruciating pain caused by
his knee arthritis, the Peterborough, N.H. man had joint
replacement surgery in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially the pain was worse than the arthritis. The first two
weeks after the operation you wonder why you had it done,''
Ercoline said. ``But when I found I could walk up and down stairs
again, and walk with a normal gait, it sure was worth it.''

   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Executions are big events here.
</P>
<P>
   The prison museum in town proudly displays the electric chair
affectionately known as Old Sparky, which was used until 1964.
Bonnie and Clyde's bullet-riddled morgue photos hang on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's execution of Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman put
to death in Texas in 135 years, attracted more people outside the
prison than attended a Harlem Globetrotters basketball game at
nearby Sam Houston State University the same night, according to
prison officials.
</P>
<P>
   But in death, fame is fleeting. If an inmate is executed and
laid to rest by the state it is his number, preceded by an ``x''
for execution _ not his name _ that appears on the small white
cross in Captain Joe Bryd Cemetery in Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Ellis Unit One
Prison, 12 miles outside Huntsville, the sun gleams off the
half-million-dollar razor wire added after a death row inmate
successfully scaled the fence last November. He was shot in the
escape then found drowned in a creek a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Death row, like the rest of the prison, is cleaner than most
office buildings. ``We've got a lot of labor,'' said one official.
The warden's office is one of the few prison areas with air
conditioning. On his walls are pictures of John Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners are allowed fans in their 6-by-10-foot cells and they
can vote on what to watch on the cellblock television. They are
taken to showers daily in handcuffs. All their mail is screened.
Two hours are allowed for recreation, but there is no shade from
the relentless sun. The basketballs in the courtyard all need air.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the triple-tiered cellblocks have both bars and wire
screens around them. These are for the inmates in segregation for
violating prison rules. When correction officers pass the
segregation cells with other prisoners, they use a shield of
plexiglass to protect themselves and the inmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are gang rivalries here and they can fire handmade darts
crafted from paper and bits of metal,'' said Larry Fitzgerald, a
spokesman for the Texas criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Photojournalists have not been allowed on Texas' death row in a
year. What follows are the thoughts and images of six juveniles
offenders there. All were 17 years old when the murders were
committed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Derek Guillen, 18
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guillen was convicted and sentenced to death for the March 26,
1998, robbery, rape, and murder of Margaret Shores, 51, the
director of a Texas child care agency. Police said Guillen broke
into Shores' home, fractured her skull, and stabbed her to death.
Guillen never testified at his trial. He told his mother that he
was at the robbery scene, then left with a friend. When he
returned, Shores was on the floor, dead, with a towel over her
head. His friends were on the couch, giggling and high on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen was captured along with four other teenagers trying to
use Shores' credit cards at a local mall. Witnesses at his trial
testified Guillen bragged that he killed Shores and then had sex
with her. DNA experts said Shores' blood was on one of Guillen's
sneakers and inside her 1996 Toyota Corolla, and his pubic hairs
were found on her corpse. At his trial, Guillen pleaded not guilty
to the charge of murder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guillen: It wasn't the way I thought it would turn out. I wasn't
there when the killing happened, and I came back and the person was
already dead. I didn't say anything. I didn't want to give a
statement to the Texas Rangers or the DA (district attorney). I
told my lawyer what happened and who to look for, and right now the
guy who did the killing is living right next door to my mom. He was
my best friend. I always thought snitching was wrong and I knew I
didn't do the actual crime.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There was a conference in Atlanta recently where they talked
about speeding up the appeals process and executions. How does that
make you feel?
</P>
<P>
   Guillen: Sometimes I think a lot of guys should get the death
penalty. (But) it's not right to hurry up and take my life just
because it will make somebody feel better. In the long run, I think
it will make matters worse. Taking a life is different than a
murder. . . . Personally, I'd rather kill myself before I let
someone kill me. It's something that bothers me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was your family life like?
</P>
<P>
   Guillen: In the beginning my dad was a pimp. He used to pimp my
mom. . . . My biological father did a lot of things. He hit her,
went out on her. I finally got a letter from him. He's locked up on
drugs. He's trying to get things right with me. He thinks I don't
remember some of the things he did to my mom.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I got high I was seven years old at my
grandfather's. I was living in Detroit. I'm half Mexican, half
black. I broke into my first house when I was nine years old, just
for something to do. My mom stands by me to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you ever think about the execution?
</P>
<P>
   Guillen: I try not to think about it. I would like to spend time
with my mom. I saw her in court crying, and I haven't been able to
touch my mom in I don't know how long.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Randy Arroyo, 20 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo, a.k.a. Abdullah Arroyo, was convicted and sentenced to
death in the March 1997 murder of US Air Force Captain Jose Cobo
during a carjacking in San Antonio. Arroyo and an accomplice,
Vincent Gutierrez, were looking for spare parts for Arroyo's Mazda.
According to witness testimony at the trial, Cobo tried to escape
but got caught in the automatic seat belt. Arroyo told Gutierrez to
shoot Cobo. The captain was shot twice in the back and his body
dumped on the shoulder of a crowded Houston highway during morning
rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo pleaded not guilty of murder and turned down a plea
bargain to testify for the state. He never testified at his trial,
but Arroyo's lawyers argued that their client was guilty only of
aggravated robbery. Gutierrez was also convicted of murder and
sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo: It's just hard, man. I don't believe they think I'm here
because I'm guilty. I'm here because I'm ignorant of the law. I
ain't got no money to pay for no lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's it like to be so young and be on death row?
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo: It's nasty. It's harder than people think. The hardest
part is coming in at 17. I'm just like every other kid. I lived in
the ghetto. I worked for every cent I had. I went to school. I
tried to get out of school. All of a sudden they pick someone at
random because it's a captain of the Air Force. Prosecutors wanted
to look good so they grabbed the first people they could come up
with.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How could you be like every other kid if you are on death row
for murder?
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo: That's if you did it. It's a terrible crime. As much as
they put out I was guilty, I want to see if they give me the same
publicity when I show how the cops corrupted the statements. No, I
didn't pull the trigger. I was not at the scene of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you were quoted at the trial as shouting, ``I tried to
help him,'' after the verdict was announced?
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo: Uh, I tried to. . .call the police when I found out what
happened. I didn't know the facts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you grow up in a dysfunctional family?
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo: I don't know what dysfunctional means. I didn't grow up
in any messed up family. We grew up hard, but we weren't messed up.
I didn't grow up with a father.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At what minimum age should a juvenile be eligible for the
death penalty?
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo: I couldn't put no age figure on it. I think that the age
that I was, I shoulda been tried as a juvenile because I'm still
ignorant to a lot of things. I don't believe no one should get the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When you're young, you think you'll live forever. Do you
still feel that way?
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo: Well, since I believe in eternal life, I do. I believe
that something good will come out of this. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Dewberry, 22
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dewberry was sentenced to death for the 1994 shotgun slaying of
Lamar University registrar Elmer Rode. Police said Rode's body was
found on Christmas afternoon. He had been tied up and shot several
times in the head during a robbery of his Beaumont, Texas, home.
Witnesses testified that Dewberry, then 17, gave items taken in the
robbery to friends as Christmas presents. Awaiting trial in 1996,
he escaped briefly while chained to another inmate, jumping from a
transport van that was taking them to a dental appointment.
Dewberry pleaded not guilty to murder and never testified at his
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Dewberry: I've been here since Nov. 25, 1996. It's
indescribable. It's an emotional roller coaster. It's a mental and
physical stroke, dealing with this place and the people that are
running it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think about the needles?
</P>
<P>
   Dewberry: Everybody on death row thinks about being executed.
It's not a matter of if you will or you won't. . . . I don't see
how you can learn a lesson from something you didn't even do.
That's one thing I never did understand about people saying, `He
showed no remorse' for this or for that. How is a person supposed
to show remorse for something they didn't have anything to do with?
I can understand it being a tragic loss for that family but they
ain't considering the tragic loss in my family.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you grow up any faster on death row?
</P>
<P>
   Dewberry You grow up quick, real fast, on death row. Hear no
evil, see no evil, speak no evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's that picture of a race car on your wall?
</P>
<P>
   Dewberry: It's a fantasy car. I sit here and pretend I'm
driving. &QL;

A SPECIAL HOLIDAY SEASON FOR BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a city that once banned Christmas (in Colonial days), Boston
boasts a holiday season that is one of the most festive in the
country. Add to this a spectacular exhibit of Egyptian treasures,
and what promises to be an unbelievable welcome to the new century,
and you have more reasons than ever to stay in the city _ or, if
you're from out of town, more reasons to head this way.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 holiday events in Boston and Cambridge are
highlighted, along with information on First Night, a festive way
to enter the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   To plan a trip to Boston, obtain the Greater Boston Convention &AMP;
Visitors Bureau's new 87-page free winter Travel Planner. Included
in the planner are events, performances, holiday happenings, hotel
packages for various events, and a Family Value Pass with 41
discounts good for shopping, restaurants, and museums.

</P>
<P>
   This season there is added excitement in the city with an
eight-month Egypt Cultural Celebration going on. ``Pharaohs of the
Sun: Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Tuttankamen Exhibition'' runs through
Feb. 6 at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, which already has one of
the best Egyptian collections in the world. The ``Mysteries of
Egypt'' Omnifilm is playing on the huge screen at the Museum of
Science. The Boston Lyric Opera, which just performed ``Aida,''
will feature ``Akhenaten'' in January and February; and
``Cleopatra'' is coming to the Wang Theatre in May.
</P>
<P>
   For the holidays, the traditional ``Nutcracker'' by the Boston
Ballet continues through Jan. 2 at the Wang, and across the street
at the Majestic, the Ballet Theatre of Boston offers its version of
the Tchaikovsky classic Dec. 8-28. Other musical treats in December
include The 146th annual performance of Handel &AMP; Haydn Society's
``Messiah,'' the 29th annual ``Black Nativity,'' the Vienna Boys
Choir, and the Holiday Boston Pops. And the Boston Symphony
Orchestra will be performing throughout the season. On stage are
``Stomp,'' ``Footloose,'' ``Ivanov,'' ``Buddy Holly Story,'' ``The
Idiots Karamazov,'' and the ``Sisters Matsumoto.''
</P>
<P>
   Festivities in Boston get underway with the lighting of the
Prudential Center tree Dec. 4, a gift of the people of Nova Scotia,
while the next night on Boston Common, another tree, this the gift
of New Brunswick, will be lighted.
</P>
<P>
   There will be lights throughout Boston. Faneuil Hall is always
colorful at this season. Newbury Street will be festive during its
annual Holiday Stroll Dec. 5, and Harvard Square will hold its
annual Holly Fair Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   More ideas for the season include Planet of the Penguins, a
celebration of these waddlers at the New England Aquarium Dec. 4-5;
the Aquarium's Bird Watching and Nature Cruise Dec. 5; the 226th
Boston Tea Party reenactment Dec. 12; the 29th Christmas Revels at
Harvard University's Sanders Theatre Dec. 10-26; the Holiday
Chocolate Bar Brunch with Santa at the Meridien Hotel Dec. 12; and
the Boston Crafts at the Castle show Dec. 2-5.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the place to be Dec. 31 is Boston for First Night
2000. The city's celebration of the eve of the millennium is a
Boston original (First Night is now celebrated in more than 100
cities). And this First Night is going to be like none before, with
countdowns and finales across the city, including multimedia
presentations and spectacular fireworks displays, with additional
fireworks the evenings of Jan. 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to catch the fun of the season is to stay in the
city. Most hotels have special packages for the Egypt exhibit,
First Night, and shopping.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ The needles, those lethal injections that
deliver $86.06 worth of chemicals designed to stop the heart, are
years away from his veins. But they are already on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Inmate number 999210 is a scared teenager on death row in the
only country known to kill its juvenile offenders. Texas leads the
nation in such executions.
</P>
<P>
   Head down, shirt off, and sweating in a 100-degree cell, Derek
Guillen, 18, wants to hug his mother, a mother who loves him so
much she once sold her body to get him milk on Christmas Day. But
if his appeal fails, he will be sent to the death chamber for the
1998 rape and murder of Margaret Shores, the director of a Texas
child care agency. As is the case with most death row juvenile
offenders interviewed, Guillen maintains he did not commit the
murder.
</P>
<P>
   On execution day, the inmate gets a last-meal request, a hot
shower, and a choice of prison-made clothes. When it is time, he
will be strapped in seven different places to a gurney and asked to
make a final statement. When the warden gives the signal _ removing
his eyeglasses _ the medical team begins a series of three lethal
injections.
</P>
<P>
   How long does it take to lapse into unconsciousness? ``One
inmate sang `Silent Night,' '' said Larry Fitzgerald, a spokesman
for the Texas criminal justice system. ``When he got to `mother and
child,' he was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 20th century comes to a close, the United States finds
itself in a position that critics argue should be as uncomfortable
as a prisoner strapped to the gurney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internationally, every other country has abandoned killing
juvenile offenders,'' said Victor L. Streib, a professor of law at
Ohio Northern University who has been tracking the number of
juveniles sentenced to death over the past 25 years. ``We're the
only ones left.''
</P>
<P>
   A report issued in October by the Death Penalty Information
Center, a Washington-based group that opposes capital punishment,
called the United States ``the most flagrant transgressor of the
international ban on executing juvenile offenders in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said that by condemning juveniles to die, the United
States is in violation of three treaties: the United Nations
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights, and the American Convention on Human
Rights. ``Nowhere is the US in such clear and direct conflict with
the consensus of international law,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States says it is not bound by the treaties because
it has not ratified two of them, and is exempted from a key
provision of the third. Washington has signed all three documents,
but it only ratified the international covenant after placing a
``reservation'' against the article that outlaws the juvenile death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 international covenant was adopted by 144 nations.
Eleven US allies, angered by Washington's reservation, formally
protested. Sweden said the American action ``undermined the basis
of international treaty law.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, the UN's Human Rights Committee voted to call the US
reservation invalid. The committee also passed a resolution urging
that the death penalty not be imposed for crimes committed by
anyone under the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
   There are five other countries known to have executed juvenile
offenders in the '90s: Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and
Yemen, but none since 1997, according to Amnesty International.
China, believed to have one of the highest rates of capital
punishment in the world, has also officially ceased the practice of
executing juvenile offenders, in accordance with laws implemented
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald, the Texas criminal justice spokesman, says the
emotional juvenile death penalty debate is often clouded by the
distinction between sentencing offenders to death when they are
juveniles, and actually carying out executions of juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't execute kids,'' he said. ``They are certified as
adults in the eyes of the law. Plus, they go through a lengthy
appeals process.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has executed 10 juvenile offenders this
decade, half of them in Texas. Because of lengthy automatic
appeals, none were teenagers at the time of their deaths. The
average time on death row in Texas is eight years and 10 months;
180 juvenile offenders have been sentenced to death in the United
States since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   A 1988 US Supreme Court ruling prohibits the death penalty for
juvenile offenders whose crimes were committed before they were 16.
Today, of the 38 states that have the death penalty, 25 allow for
the execution of juveniles whose crimes were committed when they
were 16 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 70 juvenile offenders currently sentenced to die
account for only two percent of the 3,600 US prisoners on death
row, the United States is under increasing pressure to stop
executing juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 4, Oklahoma executed Sean Sellers, 29, the first person
in 40 years put to death for crimes committed when he was 16. The
execution of Sellers triggered an international protest.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Robinson, the UN high commissioner for human rights,
unsuccessfully appealed to US officials to stop the execution, and
urged Washington to honor the UN Convention on the Rights of the
Child, even though it hadn't ratified the accord. ``The
overwhelming and growing international consensus that the death
penalty should not apply to juvenile offenders stems from the
recognition that young persons lack maturity and judgment and,
therefore, cannot be fully responsible for their actions,''
Robinson, the former president of Ireland, said at a press
conference in October. ``More importantly,'' young people ``have a
greater potential for rehabilitation than adults.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Stop Killing Kids Campaign'' sponsored by the National
Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty has gathered nearly 50,0000
student signatures urging a moratorium on the sentencing of
juveniles to death. The group plans to present the signatures to
the United Nations later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The US Supreme Court recently asked for additional arguments in
the Nevada death-penalty case of 16-year-old Michael Domingues
after his lawyers contended that by pressing for the death penalty,
the United States is in violation of the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights. Last month, the US Solicitor General
argued that the request should be denied, and the high court
announced later it would not hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   But to Samuel Jordan, director of Amnesty International's
program to abolish the death penalty, it is a moral issue, not a
legal one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only barbaric it's a brutal disregard of children's
human rights,'' Jordan said. ``Most have either mental illness or
violent abuse in their backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Victims' rights groups say that argument is a copout. ``That's
no excuse for murder,'' said Dianne Clements, president of Justice
For All, a Houston-based advocacy organization. ``Who doesn't live
in a dysfunctional family? I think it's very barbaric for criminals
to murder. I think it's very appropriate for the death sentence to
be the ultimate sentence for the ultimate crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Clinard, the daughter of Margaret Shores, vowed that she
will be there to witness Guillen being put to death. ``My son had
to learn that there are disgusting, perverted people like you in
the world,'' Clinard said at the trial in her victim's impact
statement. ``On the day you die, I will be there watching you as
you twitch.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, families of both the victim and the convicted killer
are invited to watch the executions in separate rooms behind glass
and bars. From the gurney, Guillen will be able to see his mother
watching him. There will be no hugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't allow any physical contact,'' said Fitzgerald. ``Not
even before the lethal injections.''

<P>
   Was a key part of the Christmas story borrowed from the Dead Sea
Scrolls?
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars argue that it was and point to a scroll they say
was written a generation before Jesus' birth that sounds like the
angel Gabriel's announcement to Mary that her son would be the
messiah.
</P>
<P>
   But others point to evidence in that little-known scroll that
indicates the scholars are wrong and that it -- along with other
Dead Sea Scrolls -- could not have been written until long after
the rise of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the ``Son of God'' text, the scroll reads, in part:
``He shall be hailed as son of God, and they shall call him the son
of the most high ... . His kingdom will be an eternal kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   In Luke's New Testament account of the annunciation, the angel
Gabriel told Mary: ``He will be great, and will be called the son
of the Most High ... and of His kingdom there will be no end.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Dead Sea Scroll scholars have used the scrolls to
support an increasingly popular view that there was little
originality in the divine claims of the carpenter from Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   University of Chicago scholar John Collins goes farther than
most in discussing the titles ``Son of God'' and ``Son of the Most
High'' that are used in the scroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is overwhelmingly probable that Luke borrowed these titles,
either from this text or from a common tradition to identify Jesus
as the messiah,'' Collins writes in his 1997 book, ``Apocalypticism
in the Dead Sea Scrolls.''
</P>
<P>
   One scholar, John Walvoord, chancellor of Dallas Theological
Seminary, said the implications of Collins' statement are profound
because he ``implies that Luke's gospel is not divinely inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dead Sea Scrolls are right and the Bible is wrong? How do
they know this?'' Walvoord asked.
</P>
<P>
   For Christians and Jews, questions about the significance and
dating of the scrolls are as important as the Bible itself.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming that the Son of God text and other Dead Sea Scrolls are
ancient, scroll scholars have convinced publishers of Christian
Bibles to make hundreds of changes to some recent editions of the
Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
   But the Son of God text contains long-ignored Hebrew letters,
vowel marks and tiny letters that did not come into use until after
600 AD.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars who have seen the vowels cannot explain their presence.
</P>
<P>
   Some are now confirming that the styles of several Hebrew
letters in the Son of God text are more modern than previously
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at the writing that came from the early Aramaic
alphabet compared to today, a few of those letters are closer to
the modern than they are to the ancient,'' said Martin Rubenstein,
a leading Philadelphia rabbi. ``You don't have to be a scholar to
see the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   And just as important as the physical evidence attesting to the
scroll's age are the ideas it contains and the way they are
expressed.
</P>
<P>
   For any Jewish scribe before Christ to have described a man --
even the coming messiah -- as immortal, divine and the son of God
would have been far beyond the bounds of Jewish tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that a Jew of that time didn't write this,''
said Rabbi Kenneth Weiss of El Paso, Texas. ``It's not a Jewish way
to refer to a messiah, and I don't believe a Jewish source would
ever use that phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray Friedman, director of Feinstein Center for
American-Jewish History at Philadelphia's Temple University, was
shocked to hear that a document like the Son of God text was found
among the Dead Sea Scrolls at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable!'' he said. ``If this is real ... Jesus has
been authenticated. If it's a BC document, it announces in strict,
clear-cut terms the arrival of the messiah. But if it's after, it's
worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Also disagreeing with the views of established scroll scholars
is Milton Fisher, professor of Old Testament at Philadelphia
Theological Seminary and the former president of that institution,
who said he does ``not think the Son of God text was written before
the time of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanoch Guy, professor of Hebrew and coordinator of Hebrew
Studies at Temple University in Philadelphia agrees that ``the
language is absolutely Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that this is a Christian text,'' Guy said of
the Son of God text.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Dead Sea Scrolls supposedly were written by a Jewish sect
over a period that began as early as 200 years before the birth of
Christ and ended early in the first century.
</P>
<P>
   About 68 AD, most scholars believe, the scrolls were stashed in
caves overlooking the Dead Sea where they remained undisturbed
until 1947 when an Arab shepherd boy stumbled upon them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But more than 50 years after the first scrolls came to light,
many questions remain about their origins.
</P>
<P>
   While the scrolls are a national treasure to Israel and the
basis for changes being made in the Old Testament of some Christian
Bibles, publishers of Jewish Bibles are reluctant to make the same
changes, even though the scrolls are thought to be the oldest
existing copies of Jewish holy texts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we are really leaving the (Bible) as is,'' said
Helaine Denenberg, editorial assistant with the Jewish Publication
Society, North America's foremost publisher of Jewish Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews are even more adamant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scrolls are not from mainstream Judaism, but from an
extremist sect,'' said Rabbi Yehoshua Kaganoff of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the existence of the Son of God text was known only
to a handful of scholars. But in the mid-1990s, the entire text was
published, revealing striking New Testament themes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to describing a divine messiah, the text also echoes
the New Testament description of Jesus' return and of the end
times:
</P>
<P>
   ``One nation shall trample on another nation ... (Then) his
kingdom (shall be) an everlasting kingdom ... He shall judge the
earth in righteousness, and everyone shall have peace ... and every
nation will submit to Him.'' (The parentheses represent
reconstructed passages.)
</P>
<P>
   In their efforts to portray the Son of God text as a
pre-Christian document, some scroll scholars theorize that it
referred to a figure who lived a century or more before the birth
of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence -- so hard to explain, so easy to overlook --
repeatedly suggests that the writer of the scroll was aware of New
Testament theology, of Jesus and of the end of the world that he
described.

   A Cherokee Indian boy was the youngest to be executed for
murder. He was hanged in 1885 at the age of 10. The youngest person
executed since World War II was George Stinney, 14, who at 5-feet
1-inch tall and 95 pounds was so small his mask fell off during his
electrocution in South Carolina in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, in the aftermath of the horrific school shootings
that shook the country this year and last, there was a flurry of
efforts in various states to lower the eligible age for the death
penalty. One proposal in Texas would have set the age at 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected more Draconian laws'' to be approved, said Richard
Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.
``But none of them passed. No state has lowered its minimum age
that allows for the death penalty for juveniles in the last 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several states have raised the age. Florida went from
16 to 17 and Montana from 16 to 18 on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   What hasn't changed, according to antideath penalty advocates,
is that minorities are being disproportionately targeted.
Two-thirds of the juveniles on death row are either black or
Hispanic, while two-thirds of the victims are white. Both figures
are higher than the adult death row population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real driving factor is the race of the victim,'' said
Streib, the law professor who produces a biannual report on
juvenile offenders on death row. ``White is the so-called valuable
victim syndrome. The end result is the people being executed are
four times to 10 times more likely to be people of color.''
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors cite opportunism as the more relevant factor.
``It isn't racism,'' said Chuck Rosenthal, an assistant district
attorney in Houston's Harris County. ``It's poor people targeting
and murdering wealthy people.''
</P>
<P>
   One-third of the 581 executions in the United States since 1976
have been in Texas. In the nearly five years that Governor George
W. Bush has been in office, 105 people have been executed here. The
list includes juvenile offenders, the mentally retarded, and
foreign nationals. Texas is the leader in executions of juvenile
offenders, accounting for seven of the 13 juvenile offender
executions that have taken place in the United States since the
death penalty was reinstated in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current status of the state of Texas: 17-year-old
executions is appropriate,'' Bush said last year. The Bush
administration also was responsible for lowering the age that
juveniles can be tried as adults to 14, and increasing the maximum
sentence for juveniles between 14 and 16 to 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many opponents of the death penalty feel that no one under 18
should be sentenced to death. ``That is the bright line in our
society. We don't draft or vote or serve on juries under 18,'' said
Dieter.
</P>
<P>
   But victims' families and proponents of the death penalty
disagree. ``Most bleeding hearts haven't had something like this
happen to them,'' said Bill Green, the father of Micheal Eakin, a
25-year-old Texas deputy constable who was shot to death by a
17-year-old last year. ``It's the kind of thing you only read about
in the papers. Where is the line? Did you ever go to your high
school reunion? The kids that were turds when they were 17 are now
older turds. By the time you are 16 or 17, you are pretty well set
for life. If I could volunteer to put that needle in his arm, I
would do it. Absolutely.''

<P>
   Was a key part of the Christmas story borrowed from the Dead Sea
Scrolls?
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars argue that it was and point to a scroll they say
was written a generation before Jesus' birth that sounds like the
angel Gabriel's announcement to Mary that her son would be the
messiah.
</P>
<P>
   But others point to evidence in that little-known scroll that
indicates the scholars are wrong and that it -- along with other
Dead Sea Scrolls -- could not have been written until long after
the rise of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the ``Son of God'' text, the scroll reads, in part:
``He shall be hailed as son of God, and they shall call him the son
of the most high ... . His kingdom will be an eternal kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   In Luke's New Testament account of the annunciation, the angel
Gabriel told Mary: ``He will be great, and will be called the son
of the Most High ... and of His kingdom there will be no end.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Dead Sea Scroll scholars have used the scrolls to
support an increasingly popular view that there was little
originality in the divine claims of the carpenter from Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   University of Chicago scholar John Collins goes farther than
most in discussing the titles ``Son of God'' and ``Son of the Most
High'' that are used in the scroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is overwhelmingly probable that Luke borrowed these titles,
either from this text or from a common tradition to identify Jesus
as the messiah,'' Collins writes in his 1997 book, ``Apocalypticism
in the Dead Sea Scrolls.''
</P>
<P>
   One scholar, John Walvoord, chancellor of Dallas Theological
Seminary, said the implications of Collins' statement are profound
because he ``implies that Luke's gospel is not divinely inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dead Sea Scrolls are right and the Bible is wrong? How do
they know this?'' Walvoord asked.
</P>
<P>
   For Christians and Jews, questions about the significance and
dating of the scrolls are as important as the Bible itself.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming that the Son of God text and other Dead Sea Scrolls are
ancient, scroll scholars have convinced publishers of Christian
Bibles to make hundreds of changes to some recent editions of the
Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
   But the Son of God text contains long-ignored Hebrew letters,
vowel marks and tiny letters that did not come into use until after
600 AD.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars who have seen the vowels cannot explain their presence.
</P>
<P>
   Some are now confirming that the styles of several Hebrew
letters in the Son of God text are more modern than previously
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at the writing that came from the early Aramaic
alphabet compared to today, a few of those letters are closer to
the modern than they are to the ancient,'' said Martin Rubenstein,
a leading Philadelphia rabbi. ``You don't have to be a scholar to
see the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   And just as important as the physical evidence attesting to the
scroll's age are the ideas it contains and the way they are
expressed.
</P>
<P>
   For any Jewish scribe before Christ to have described a man --
even the coming messiah -- as immortal, divine and the son of God
would have been far beyond the bounds of Jewish tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that a Jew of that time didn't write this,''
said Rabbi Kenneth Weiss of El Paso, Texas. ``It's not a Jewish way
to refer to a messiah, and I don't believe a Jewish source would
ever use that phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray Friedman, director of Feinstein Center for
American-Jewish History at Philadelphia's Temple University, was
shocked to hear that a document like the Son of God text was found
among the Dead Sea Scrolls at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable!'' he said. ``If this is real ... Jesus has
been authenticated. If it's a BC document, it announces in strict,
clear-cut terms the arrival of the messiah. But if it's after, it's
worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Also disagreeing with the views of established scroll scholars
is Milton Fisher, professor of Old Testament at Philadelphia
Theological Seminary and the former president of that institution,
who said he does ``not think the Son of God text was written before
the time of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanoch Guy, professor of Hebrew and coordinator of Hebrew
Studies at Temple University in Philadelphia agrees that ``the
language is absolutely Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that this is a Christian text,'' Guy said of
the Son of God text.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Dead Sea Scrolls supposedly were written by a Jewish sect
over a period that began as early as 200 years before the birth of
Christ and ended early in the first century.
</P>
<P>
   About 68 AD, most scholars believe, the scrolls were stashed in
caves overlooking the Dead Sea where they remained undisturbed
until 1947 when an Arab shepherd boy stumbled upon them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But more than 50 years after the first scrolls came to light,
many questions remain about their origins.
</P>
<P>
   While the scrolls are a national treasure to Israel and the
basis for changes being made in the Old Testament of some Christian
Bibles, publishers of Jewish Bibles are reluctant to make the same
changes, even though the scrolls are thought to be the oldest
existing copies of Jewish holy texts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we are really leaving the (Bible) as is,'' said
Helaine Denenberg, editorial assistant with the Jewish Publication
Society, North America's foremost publisher of Jewish Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews are even more adamant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scrolls are not from mainstream Judaism, but from an
extremist sect,'' said Rabbi Yehoshua Kaganoff of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the existence of the Son of God text was known only
to a handful of scholars. But in the mid-1990s, the entire text was
published, revealing striking New Testament themes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to describing a divine messiah, the text also echoes
the New Testament description of Jesus' return and of the end
times:
</P>
<P>
   ``One nation shall trample on another nation ... (Then) his
kingdom (shall be) an everlasting kingdom ... He shall judge the
earth in righteousness, and everyone shall have peace ... and every
nation will submit to Him.'' (The parentheses represent
reconstructed passages.)
</P>
<P>
   In their efforts to portray the Son of God text as a
pre-Christian document, some scroll scholars theorize that it
referred to a figure who lived a century or more before the birth
of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence -- so hard to explain, so easy to overlook --
repeatedly suggests that the writer of the scroll was aware of New
Testament theology, of Jesus and of the end of the world that he
described.

PLAYING TRICKS WITH TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where will you be when Year 2000 arrives? Whether it's near or
far, chances are your location won't be as unusual as that of
passengers on the steamer Warrimoo when the year 1900 was about to
be ushered in. Here, from the long-gone publication Ships and the
Sea, is their story.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 30, 1899, the Warrimoo was in the mid-Pacific on its way
from Vancouver to Australia when the first mate told Captain John
D. S. Phillips, ``We're only a few miles from the intersection of
the equator and the international date line!''
</P>
<P>
   Now Phillips had a somewhat prankish personality, so he set out
to achieve the navigation trick of a lifetime. He changed course
and adjusted the ship's speed so that at midnight local time the
Warrimoo was right on the equator at the exact point where it
crosses the date line. That brought these results:
</P>
<P>
   --The front part of the ship was in the Southern Hemisphere and
in the middle of summer. The stern was in the Northern Hemisphere
and the middle of winter.
</P>
<P>
   --The date in the after part of the ship was Dec. 30, 1899.
Forward, it was Jan. 1, 1900.
</P>
<P>
   --The ship was thus in two different days, two different months,
two different seasons, and (as the popular conception has it,
anyway) two different centuries _ all at once.
</P>
<P>
   --Not only were passengers cheated out of a New Year's Eve
celebration, they lost an entire day _ Dec. 31, 1899 _ forever. But
then again, they were undoubtedly the first to greet the year 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Phillips said, ``I never heard of it happening
before, and I guess it won't happen again until the year 2000!''
But as Robert Norling of Concord, N.H., who forwarded the article
to us, notes, ``What if . . . ships, large and small, have the same
idea, all jousting for position at (latitude/longitude) 0/180?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: Which is the world's highest city? (Answer at end of
column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: Disney Magazine reports that some theme-park employees
are beginning to use ``Disney'' as a verb. ``To `Disney' someone is
to make them happy against their will.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``Never let a stranger guard your laptop (at the airport)
while you go for a newspaper or a cup of coffee _ even if the
person looks exactly like your Peoria grandmother'' _ one of 19
tips on protecting your laptop while traveling, offered by veteran
Boston publicist C. Paul Luongo in Travel Smart newsletter. &QL; 
 &QL; 
How's that again? A Norwood resident named Casey found this sign at
a Holiday Inn a tad amazing: ``Our indoor heated pool . . . is open
year round . . . weather permitting.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Punchy: Visitors to Tokyo's fashionable Ginza district may see an
unusual attraction: a human punching bag. A man named Jun Sato has
allowed anyone to punch him up for 1,000 yen ($10) for three
minutes, according to the Mainichi Daily News. (He does wear
protective face and stomach equipment.) Says Sato: ``I enjoy being
used as a punching bag. It's good business and also another way to
experience life.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: Oxford, Ohio, forbids a woman to take her
clothes off while standing in front of a man's picture. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lots of company: Some 33.8 million people will be traveling during
the holiday season, the AAA estimates. Nearly 58 percent will stay
at the home of a friend or relative; 32 percent will stay in a
hotel or motel; and the rest will camp, be on a ship, or stay at a
bed-and-breakfast. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Advice to go: As the standard ``contract of carriage'' printed on
plane tickets notes, airlines are not required to provide lodging
or meals for weather-related delays or cancellations. But it never
hurts to ask. Some airlines will do something sometimes. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Lhasa, Tibet, which stands at 12,087 feet. &QL;

THE BIG RESORT AT SEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Is this a ship or a land-based resort that just happens
to be floating on water?
</P>
<P>
   This is the question cruise passengers will be asking as they
wander about the Voyager of the Seas, the world's largest cruise
ship. It even dwarfs the USS Nimitz, the Navy's largest aircraft
carrier!
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, cruise lines have been racing to build new and
bigger ships. Carnival and Princess cruise lines have each held the
title of world's largest with liners in the 100,000-ton class. But
the Voyager is 30 percent bigger than those ships, so Royal
Caribbean now has the title and should hold it for some time. No
other company, as yet, has announced plans to top this 142,000-ton
liner.
</P>
<P>
   Call the Voyager a resort at sea, and Royal Caribbean officials
will nod in agreement. ``The Voyager was not built to top our
competition,'' Richard Fain, chief executive officer of the line,
said. Instead, it was built to take aim at Las Vegas and other
resorts by luring more land-based vacationers out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Voyager of the Seas, now into its second week of sailings in
the Caribbean, has to be seen to be believed. ``Incredible'' is the
most heard comment of passengers. ``Like no ship before'' is
another comment. And to make sure no one misses the point, Royal
Caribbean has emblazoned ``Like no vacation on Earth'' on the side
of the ship. Sail on it, and you'll more than likely agree _ it is
like no other vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you'll find features other ships offer, but the Voyager
goes beyond other liners in both amenities and technology. What
other ship has a full-sized ice skating rink? Or a four-deck-high
Royal Promenade that meanders down the center of the vessel, with
staterooms overlooking the scene rather than the water? Or a
rock-climbing wall 200 feet above the sea, or an in-line skating
course, or a Johnny Rockets hamburger haven?
</P>
<P>
   Despite its 15-deck size and capacity to carry almost 4,000
passengers, the Voyager of the Seas is an easy vessel to get
around.
</P>
<P>
   Being the biggest ship at sea, it has, well, the largest of
everything, from theater to casino. About the only things
standard-sized are the staterooms. They are comfortable and nicely
furnished but no bigger than staterooms on other Royal Caribbean
ships _ unless one goes for one of the fancier suites. Of the
ship's 1,557 staterooms, 765 have private balconies on the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Voyager has the latest in technical systems. With its
Dynamic Positioning satellite guidance system, the ship can stop
and hold its position without dropping anchor, making the vessel
environmentally friendly around fragile Caribbean reefs. Royal
Caribbean, which has paid a heavy price for its former
environmentally unfriendly deeds, now has one of the strongest
environmental programs at sea
</P>
<P>
   For those who go on a cruise to be on the ocean, the most
negative feature of the ship is that Royal Caribbean is trying too
hard to have the Voyager be a resort with an emphasis on inside
activities, not on the ocean. However, the ship does have lots of
deck space topside and boasts three swimming pools, six whirlpools,
a sports court, a jogging track, an in-line skating track, a
nine-hole miniature golf course, and a sunbathing area. The
rock-climbing wall is aft on the ship's smokestack.
</P>
<P>
   Inside is where the ship truly impresses. The Royal Promenade is
probably the most innovative mall experience you could ask for. Set
between two 11-deck atriums, with the width of three car lanes, are
shops, dining areas, a coffee bar, a sports bar, an old-English
bar, a gaming arcade that not only revolves but has the world's
largest interactive roulette wheel, activated by a four-deck-high
roulette ball tower The promenade is also a mecca for jugglers,
musicians, mimes, and even a parade or two featuring lavish
costumes and a marching band. Another innovation is overhead, where
three decks of staterooms overlook not the ocean but this lively
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Below the Royal Promenade is Casino Royale, not surprisingly the
largest at sea. One entrance has buried treasure underneath the
Plexiglas floor. Down one more deck is the ice-skating rink,
complete with a Zamboni-like machine. Not only will there be
performances by ice skating professionals, but passengers can rent
skates. This afternoon, a TV special filmed last week on the rink
will be seen on NBC television at 4 p.m. The show stars champion
figure skater Katarina Witt, who is also the ship's godmother,
having dedicated the Voyager Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The rink also doubles as Studio B, a fully equipped television
studio that also will be used for game shows.
</P>
<P>
   The ship is very lively at night. La Scala, a 1,350-seat
five-story theater, complete with an orchestra pit and
state-of-the-art technology, offers spectacular, original, and
colorful entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The Vault is a two-level disco that requires a handprint to
enter its dark but lively scene. The Schooner Bar has a talented
piano player ready to play your favorites or provide the sounds for
a sing-along. There's also Cleopatra's Needle where you'll find
music for dancing or easy listening. Or head to Deck 14 for the
Viking Crown lounge and some cool jazz sounds. Or try the Royale
Promenade where you can sip champagne or just watch the
entertainers strolling about. Or head to the Connoisseur's Club for
a fine cigar.
</P>
<P>
   As on any cruise ship, no one will go hungry. But on the Voyager
there is dining in fine style. The dining room features three
separately themed areas _ Carmen, La Boheme, and the Magic Flute,
all named for operas _ and covers three decks, with all rooms
connected by a grand staircase. It's not only beautifully designed
but also very quiet; you can talk without shouting at your
neighbor. There is also an alternative Italian restaurnat, and for
casual dining, the Windjammer with indoor and outdoor seating on
Deck 11 is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Even Johnny
Rockets, with its '50s diner appearance, works very nicely on this
ship.
</P>
<P>
   On this ship, no passengers can say they are bored. It has
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Even the children will be amazed at what is offered them. The
3-to-17 set will discover a world all their own, with separate
areas for ages 3-5, 6-8, 9-12, and 13-17. A pool, science program,
slides, teen lounge, and are available. Some party or other
activities do have a charge, but most activities are free.
</P>
<P>
   The ship has a large Internet cafe on Deck 8 along with a
library. Cruisers can send and receive e-mails, check on stocks,
even send picture postcards.
</P>
<P>
   The Voyager is also after business travelers and has not only a
convention center but also a business center with all the services
found in a fine hotel.
</P>
<P>
   And, like a fine land resort, it has a spa that offers all the
relaxing treatments one could ask for, along with a huge gym that
overlooks the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean is so confident of this vessel that it has two
similar ships setting sail in late 2000 and a third in 2001.

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 HUNTSVILLE, Texas: ... I'm driving.  Leo Little, 19
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The jury deliberated only 35 minutes before convicting Little of
capital murder for the kidnapping, robbery, and slaying of Antonio
Christopher Chavez, an accountant and devout Jehovah's Witness, on
Jan. 22, 1998. Little told police he was looking for drug money. In
his confession, he detailed how he hid in the back seat of Chavez's
unlocked car outside a San Antonio restaurant. He forced Chavez at
gunpoint to drive to his apartment and then down a rural road.
Little forced Chavez out of the car and ordered him to kneel before
firing three shots into the back of his head and robbing him of
several hundred dollars in church offerings. Chavez was found 12
hours later in critical condition. He died two days after that.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement Little's attorney, Jeff Scott, told
jurors, ``It would be an insult for us to tell you to do anything
but find Leo Little guilty of this crime.'' Little, testifying in
his own behalf, begged the jury to sentence him to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You are in here for capital murder. Are you guilty?
</P>
<P>
   Little: Yeah, I did it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What led up to the murder?
</P>
<P>
   Little: I was drunk. I was a real druggie out there. I told them
I killed him. I confessed all the way. I asked for pity and
everything and they just acted the other way. I killed a Jehovah's
Witness. He was real religious and that's about it. I was drunk and
I didn't use good judgment. I didn't need to kill the guy. I just
pulled the trigger and it happened in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you get executed are you going to make a final statement?
</P>
<P>
   Little: I've been thinking about that a lot lately. Debating
what to say. It may sound stupid but I may sing a song. I don't
know the name of it. It's a country song about choices. Choices I
made. It's between that and apologizing again to the family
members.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you pass the time?
</P>
<P>
   Little: I sleep all the time and put on weight. That metal roof
gets real hot. I went two months without a fan. It's tough.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you worried about being executed soon?
</P>
<P>
   Little: They're rushing executions. Some older guys have been
here 15, 20 years. I hear they're speeding things up for them to
get executed five years after you get here. I just told my defense
lawyers, `Just get me the death sentence.' I was on a little
suicide mission. I felt like the state killed me already, I was so
depressed. I'm still a kid when I get here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think about in here?
</P>
<P>
   Little: Always thinking about my past. Constantly. The break in
the road, where I went off the path. I should've stayed in school.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you believe in an eye for an eye?
</P>
<P>
   Little: I don't think it's fair to execute anybody. But then
again, if it happened to my family, I would have real hatred
towards the person and would kind of want the state to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it possible to get rehabilitated on death row?
</P>
<P>
   Little: I was rehabilitated the moment I went into county jail.
I'm not supposed to take a life. I got depressed straight. Help me,
I'm not much of a speaker. I'd cry in front of you if I could.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lopez, 18
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lopez was convicted of the Sept. 29, 1998, killing of Micheal
Eakin, 25, a Harris County deputy constable.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez and five others were in a car stopped by Eakin for
speeding. The 5-foot-3-inch, 120-pound Lopez, who was high on paint
thinner and afraid of going to jail for parole violations, ran.
Eakin caught him and was about to handcuff him when Lopez pulled a
gun and fired over his shoulder, wounding Eakin in the head. Before
fleeing, he fired again, hitting Eakin in the throat. Lopez was
captured the next day. He gave police a videotaped confession at
the scene then changed his story several times. At his trial, Lopez
pleaded not guilty to murder. On the advice of his attorneys, he
didn't testify, but in a rambling courtroom outburst he lashed out
against his lawyers. He also said the shooting was accidental.
``Only me and only God and only Jesus know what happened,'' Lopez
said. ``I didn't mean to kill him. I didn't shoot to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez: I didn't do it. I mean, I don't want to talk about it.
I'll talk about anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think it's fair for a 17-year-old to be given the
death sentence?
</P>
<P>
   Lopez: All that stuff ain't fair. You get people that kill lots
of people and they get out of death row, like Charles Manson. He
killed a lot of people. I had a bad attorney. He didn't want to
help me. I think 17 is too immature. They charge you as an adult
but you can't do all the adult things. You can't buy beer, you
can't even buy cigarettes. You can't do a lot of things. You're not
even mature enough to buy condoms and all that stuff, but you're
mature enough to get the death sentence and go through all of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think you can be rehabilitated?
</P>
<P>
   Lopez: Yeah, I believe in God. I just believe in the Lord, know
what I'm saying? You learn a lesson. I'm already rehabilitated. I
got the Lord on my side.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have dreams?
</P>
<P>
   Lopez: Bad dreams. I'm running through the fields and the cops
are chasing me. . .then I wake up.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are you going to be thinking when they strap you down on
that table?
</P>
<P>
   Lopez: I'll be thinking about my girl.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have anything against cops?
</P>
<P>
   Lopez: I don't like the ones that are racial, the other ones I
don't have nothing against. They're good people too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the family of the cop you killed? What would you
say if they were right here?
</P>
<P>
   Lopez: I felt real bad. Whatever anything I say, I don't think
it's gonna matter. I mean, I feel real bad for them, everything
that happened, but there ain't nothing I can do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you scared?
</P>
<P>
   Lopez: I'm afraid, do you know what I'm saying?
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've been convicted of killing a cop. You're not going to
get a lot of sympathy from people about being with your girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez: I don't really care what people say or what they think. I
just know what I know and what I want. I know I'm no threat to the
future. I know I'm safe to be out on the streets. I've completely
changed. A situation like this will change a man completely.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think a 17-year-old is too young to die?
</P>
<P>
   Lopez: I am a kid. I never shaved before I got in here and they
gave me a razor. You from Massachusetts? Where's that?''
</P>
<P>
   Q: New England.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez: New England? That's another country. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Gary Graham, 38 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Graham, a.k.a. Shaka Sankofa, was convicted and sentenced to
death in the May 1981 robbery and fatal shooting of Bobby Grant
Lambert outside a Houston supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   A witness testified that Lambert was leaving the supermarket
when Graham reached into his pockets and then shot Lambert as they
scuffled. Lambert, robbed of the change he had from a $100 bill,
staggered back into the store and died.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, a grandfather who has spent more time in jail than he
has been free, is the oldest juvenile defender on death row. Graham
pleaded guilty to 10 other aggravated robberies _ including two
shootings _ during a weeklong crime spree following Lambert's
murder. But he pleaded not guilty to the murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Graham case sparked international attention with celebrity
support from Danny Glover, Spike Lee, Harry Belafonte, and Kenny
Rogers. Graham was convicted on the testimony of one eyewitness.
Later eyewitnesses surfaced who claimed the killer was shorter than
Graham. The prosecution contended the witnesses were not credible,
but no murder weapon or matching fingerprints were found linking
Graham to the killing. He has steadfastly denied he killed Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've been quoted as saying you're going to fight like hell
on the way to the execution chamber. Is that still true?
</P>
<P>
   Graham: Absolutely. In the final process, the only way to
maintain dignity is to fight. It's a normal human process.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's it like spending more time in jail than as a free man?
</P>
<P>
   Graham: It's a very horrendous ordeal. It's been a long time.
But the only thing I can do is what I have done _ try to make the
most of a bad situation, and to speak out about the death penalty
process.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were you like at 17? Did you consider yourself a
juvenile or a man?
</P>
<P>
   Graham: I was a young kid. I think it's a development process.
You have to become a man and stand up and fight for what you
believe in. You have to fight or else you die.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What message do you have for the 17-year-olds on death row?
</P>
<P>
   Graham: It depends on the kid, his circumstances. The most
powerful message is to speak out against what's happening here.
This killing process in Texas. I think the
</P>
<P>
   hardest part is seeing the senseless process of men being
executed. Seeing that continue to rise. Resist. Change the system
for those that come behind us. Death row is not just for the dead. &QL;

THE NEW NEW THING 
A Silicon Valley Story 
By Michael Lewis. Norton. 268 pp. $25.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all its prodigious research, a vital fact is missing from
Michael Lewis's remarkable new book, ``The New New Thing: A Silicon
Valley Story.'' He nowhere reveals the name of the wealthy fellow
who hired a Dutch boat builder named Wolter Huisman to build a
remarkable yacht called Juliet, and thereby changed the course of
economic history.
</P>
<P>
   This Juliet, completed in 1993, was easily among the most lavish
sailing vessels ever built. Its anonymous owner was a friend of a
brilliant, erratic, passionate computer scientist named Jim Clark,
who took one look at the boat and decided he had to have something
even grander _ a giant sailboat entirely run by computer. It would
be a boat so advanced that Clark would be able to sit at his office
desk and sail it by pressing buttons on his computer.
</P>
<P>
   Only trouble was how to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Clark raised the money by persuading the backers of his new
business venture to sell a large piece of their firm on the stock
exchange. Netscape Communications Corp. made software for the
Internet, a communications medium then used by a mere handful of
people. Netscape gave away its products and had never earned a
dime. But against the better judgment of his colleagues, Clark had
his way. And so in 1995, Netscape went public _ and had the biggest
new stock offering the world had seen up to that time.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet boom that has transformed the US economy began that
day, as stunned venture capitalists and entrepreneurs spent
billions in hopes of repeating Netscape's astounding coup. That day
also began the establishment of the Internet as a mass
communications medium, today used by 70 million Americans. And that
day may also have begun the downward slide of giant Microsoft
Corp., which now faces the threat of a government-sponsored
dismantling _ payback for the company's allegedly illegal efforts
to crush the Netscape challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But what of that? What really matters is that Jim Clark could
now afford to build a boat bigger than the Juliet.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of Lewis's irreverence that he places the greed
and arrogance of one man at the center of the most significant
business story since the days of Henry Ford. Yet Lewis also
captures Clark's childlike curiosity, his heroic daring, the
ferocious diligence of a dirt-poor high school dropout turned
microchip designer and entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape was the second great company Clark had founded. In the
1980s, he created Silicon Graphics, once the world leader in
three-dimensional computer graphics. Enraged that the lion's share
of the wealth went to the guys in suits instead of the engineers,
he founded Netscape as payback. And once he became convinced that
Microsoft would inevitably overwhelm Netscape, he headed off to
found yet another stock market sensation, the medical software
company Healtheon.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis leaves no doubt that avarice drives Clark like a cattle
prod; now a billionaire with the yacht of his dreams, he cannot
bear the thought that database software magnate Larry Ellison is
still richer than he is and vows to retire once he has pulled even.
But Clark's also the guy who works himself to exhaustion designing
software to control his boat, just because it has never been done.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's former life as a Wall Street investment banker taught
him the ways of the wealthy; somewhere along the way he has picked
up a great deal of knowledge about computers and the Internet as
well. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of this book is that the
casual reader, with little knowledge of the industry, will scarcely
notice how well informed this book is. There are no chapter-long
ramblings through the underbrush of bytes and bandwidth; on most
pages, the only digits you will see are a page number, or perhaps
an important date. The whole thing is well under 300 pages and will
take you an evening or two to read.
</P>
<P>
   And yet all the vital information is here _ a capsule history of
an economic drama like few others. Those of us who write about this
stuff for a living know how difficult it is to sound even vaguely
coherent; Lewis's prose achieves a novelistic elegance. He has
written a book to go on the shelf alongside Tracy Kidder's 1980
classic about the computer business, ``The Soul of a New Machine.''
And as with Kidder's book, it succeeds because it ultimately is not
about technology at all, but about a flawed, fascinating man who
designs yachts and entire industries to suit himself.

 &HT;    Tree near Civil War battle site drops a heavy reminder of
conflict
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAFFIN'S BLUFF, Va. _ More than 130 years after Appomattox,
Karen Storer came within a second or two of becoming another
casualty of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard this noise _ `chachoo, chachoo' _ looked up and a big
old branch was coming down, and then a cannon ball,'' says Storer,
47. ``It might've hit me on the head, but I was washing my car, and
had just moved.''
</P>
<P>
   When it went kaplunk, she instantly knew what it was, ``because
there's a trench right behind my house,'' 10 miles south of
Richmond, where a major Civil War battle took place in the fall of
1864.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of many unsung battles near Richmond before Lee's
surrender at Appomattox a few months later, so the Battle of
Chaffin's Bluff doesn't take up much space in history books.
</P>
<P>
   To historians, though, it's famous because 14 of 18 Medals of
Honor awarded to African-American soldiers in the War Between the
States were for acts of heroism while fighting well-entrenched
Rebels right around here, overlooking the mighty James River.
</P>
<P>
   The 25th Battalion Virginia Infantry, also known as the Richmond
City Battalion, was stationed at Chaffin's Bluff for most of the
war, and a hospital was located nearby. It's likely many artifacts
found by current residents Jimmy Dean and his wife Donna belonged
to men in that unit.
</P>
<P>
   Storer doesn't know why the 6-pound cannonball fell, but many of
the trees near her cottage are ancient.
</P>
<P>
   A full-time gardener for Dean, known in Virginia as the
``sausage baron,'' Storer told her employer about the incident. He
called police to make sure the ball, probably fired by attacking
Yankees, wouldn't blow up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a story 'round here of a guy trying to beat the rust
off of one and it exploded and killed him,'' says Dean, most famous
as the singer of the superhit ``Big Bad John'' in 1961. ``It had
powder in it.''
</P>
<P>
   This one didn't, and it's now on the mantle in Dean's mansion
nearby, near dozens of other Civil War relics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh Lord, we've found knives, forks, horseshoes, belt buckles,
bullets by the blue jillion,'' Dean says. ``But the idea that the
cannon ball could've been tucked in that big tree for 130 some
years, it's wonderful. It makes it all come alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Storer's just grateful she's not dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a close call,'' she laughs. ``And I'm a Yankee.''

FAIR-TRADE COFFEE BREWS RICHER CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Maybe you haven't heard about fair-trade coffee yet. I know
most of you sit around sipping your latte and never think about
where the stuff comes from, or what goes on behind the scenes to
bring it to you. You never think of the sweat and the danger we
face getting the beans from the mountainsides of Nicaragua to your
smiley-face coffee cup in Wherever.
</P>
<P>
   Well, let me tell you, right now there is a movement afoot in
the United States to disrupt the time-honored traditions of the
great coffee-growing regions of the world. The fair-trade coffee
campaign recently has washed onto America's shores from Europe,
where for the past 11 years it has whipped up consumer hysteria in
favor of a ludicrous set of ethical standards for the business of
farming and selling coffee beans. This movement is just like those
other wild-eyed campaigns that have forced unreasonable principles
on tuna fishermen and sweatshop operators.
</P>
<P>
   The fair-trade movement allows poor coffee farmers to sell their
beans directly to roasters and retailers. In America, it has taken
off in the San Francisco area. The group behind it, TransFair USA,
plans to expand soon to Seattle and then to Boston and Washington,
D.C. next year. The organization sweet-talks US roasters, shops and
grocery chains into promising to buy only coffee that carries the
fair-trade stamp of approval.
</P>
<P>
   It all smells like the rich aroma of early morning, doesn't it?
Well, guess who loses? I do _ big, bad Coyote. That's what they
call me in the mountains of Nicaragua. All this fair-trade stuff
cuts me right out of the picture. I'm the middleman. I'm the guy
who buys the coffee from the farmers and sells it to the next
person down the line.
</P>
<P>
   I pay a fine figure of 40 cents a pound. Now that I'm out of the
picture, the farmer is selling direct to his buyers at $1.26 a
pound.
</P>
<P>
   Outrageous! What does a poor farmer need that kind of money for?
Sure, I know all about the fellow who buys a new mule and some farm
equipment, and eats a little better than he used to, maybe even
sends his kids to school. Is all of this really necessary? Coffee
farmers are used to suffering. Why upset things?
</P>
<P>
   Listen up: Coyote needs his cut. And he'll do whatever it takes
to get it. There was that mishap in Chiapas, Mexico, where a guy
was shot to death for trying to organize local farmers into a
fair-trade group. The simple fact is we middlemen are essential.
Coffee farmers need me just as much as stock market investors need
brokers. For a teeny price, we provide a gigantic service. Mark my
words _ neither of us will ever vanish. I reserve the right to beat
and kick and kill to preserve an honored way of life.
</P>
<P>
   So now you've heard the truth. It's up to you, the consumer. Go
ahead and look for the fair-trade label on your coffee. Have a
nice, peaceful cup. But ask yourself, do you really want to lift up
the poor, miserable coffee farmer at my expense? Think about it.
His life, after all, doesn't amount to a hill of beans.

 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the decade Simon Schama spent working on ``Rembrandt's
Eyes,'' his massive new book about the Dutch painter, he hit upon a
novel form of research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deliberately did not want to use the professional lingo,''
Schama (pronounced SHAH-muh) says over lunch at the Boston Museum
of Fine Arts. ``I did want to use verbs that came from walking
around or cooking or something.
</P>
<P>
   ``So going around with my little notebooks and sitting in front
of every Rembrandt, I would actually make word lists in this crazy
way. I wanted to try and develop a way of describing paint which
was actually about the physical properties as they appear if you
were to do the thing which you must never do, rub your hands over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Rembrandt's Eyes,'' as in his six other books, Schama, 54,
has striven to make the past a hands-on presence in the lives of
his readers. ``Making it immediate,'' he says of history, ``that's
the attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he has become one of the most celebrated
historians of his generation. He's also drawn the occasional
disdain of specialists and been accused of sloppiness and
superficiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's somebody I have a huge admiration for,'' says Oxford
University historian Niall Ferguson, who sees Schama's career as
``an encouragement not to be too abstruse in one's work and (to)
try to reach that general readership.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Israel, professor of Dutch history at University
College London, agrees with Ferguson about Schama's ability to
reach a popular audience _ but little else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my opinion that he is particularly good as a
historian,'' Israel says. Although Schama ``is very important as a
writer and popularizer of both historical and art-historical
knowledge, I don't consider him an important scholar in either
field.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an age-old story, the battle between popularizing
generalists and academic specialists, but Schama adds a twist. His
academic credentials are impeccable (educated at Cambridge,
teaching posts there and at Oxford, Harvard, and now Columbia). His
field of expertise, early-modern Dutch history, is far from the
Anglo-American mainstream. Yet this hasn't kept Schama from
offending what he terms ``the appropriateness cops.'' He has
actively reached out to a broader audience and essayed such
anomalous roles for an academic historian as BBC documentary
presenter and art critic for The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very sui generis. There's no one like Simon,'' says Sir
J. H. Plumb, who taught him at Cambridge. ``He was born to be a
star.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Schama looks like Gene Hackman and writes a pyrotechnic
prose worthy of a Fourth of July sky. ``Obviously, I'm drawn to
it,'' Schama says when asked about intellectual showmanship, and
his writing is as much performance as communication. No one puts
quite the torque on a fact that he does _ let alone comes up with
such astonishing oddities of historical data. The overall effect
can be breathtaking in its bravura.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this description of a 1629 Rembrandt self-portrait:
``The light reveals a full, mobile mouth, the lips highlit as if
nervously licked; large, liquid eyes; a great acreage of cheek and
chin; and, planted in the center of his face, the least aquiline
nose in seventeenth-century painting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day,'' says Israel, ``what is truly
exceptional about his work is its rhetorical skill. . . . In that
respect, he's unrivaled. Of course, there's always a temptation
then to move away from what is intellectually cogent to what is
(merely) evocative.''
</P>
<P>
   Even its detractors concede that the new book is a tour de
force. But even some of its admirers wonder where the tour
ultimately leads. ``Rembrandt's Eyes'' is classic Schama. It opens
with a cannon salvo and ends with the birth of a baby in Indonesia.
What comes in between isn't quite a biography, nor is it a social
history, nor is it a work of art criticism _ though it comprises
elements of all three and much else besides.
</P>
<P>
   What the book has in abundance is an appreciation for ``the
eloquence of peculiarity.'' That phrase comes from the Rembrandt
book's immediate predecessor, ``Landscape and Memory'' (1995), and
describes the ruling intellectual passion of the art historian Aby
Warburg. Schama's own fondness for the concept is hard to miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, that's certainly true,'' he says. ``I'm drawn to the
uproarious, the teeming canvas: a sense of history as theatrum
mundi, the sort of aliveness you find in a Hogarth print.''
</P>
<P>
   Searching for a further example, Schama turns to literature. ``I
love that incredible detail right at the very end of (Giuseppe
Lampedusa's novel) `The Leopard,' where Concetta and her sister are
throwing out all the old rubbish and they throw out the prince's
dog, which has become a rug, literally at the master's feet, and
they chuck it as an old, mangy, moth-eaten, piece of crap. And
Lampedusa describes it in flight, in midair, as for a moment
resembling the dog alive, jumping up, actually, or in space. And I
thought, oh God, you know, that's it. History is the illusion of
something very dead being brought instantaneously alive: the dead
dog in flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Schama in flight is, if anything, even more playful and
irreverent than on the page. ``He's always been almost excessively
ebullient,'' Plumb says with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   A man of headlong enthusiasms and effervescent talk, Schama
speaks in jitterbugging italics. Emphases and escalating
superlatives punctuate his speech the way ums and throat-clearings
do most people's. ``This is brilliant,'' he announces in a
characteristic progression. ``This is so good, so funny. It's just
absolutely divine.'' He's talking about a menu.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly everything is grist for Schama's conversational mill:
Viking graffiti in Scotland, the Venerable Bede's world view,
admission rates at Columbia, the perils equine flatulence pose to
equestrians. He's the senior-common-room equivalent of a great jazz
soloist, his riffs pure Oxbridge bebop.
</P>
<P>
   What's so impressive about Schama's talk is his ability to
improvise on his own improvisations. He'll start out talking about
one thing, immediately shift to another, and then (after a lengthy
aside about something altogether different) manage somehow to get
back to where he started, hardly missing a beat, and with room to
spare for the inevitable ``colossal,'' ``stupendous,'' and/or
``catastrophic.'' It comes as no surprise when he mentions that one
of his favorite books is ``Tristram Shandy,'' that 18th-century
monument to the delectability of digression.
</P>
<P>
   A descendant of Eastern European Jews, Schama grew up in
northern London and remembers seeing his first Rembrandt, a
self-portrait, at Kenwood House on Hampstead Heath. ``There was
something staggeringly, intimidatingly mysterious about it,'' he
says.

   DIVIDED KOSOVO: In the spring, the Serbs sought to drive ethnic

the Albanians have been returning the favor, killing hundreds of
Serbs and burning their houses and driving them out. Now the Serbs
as well as Gypsies are a vulnerable population who live in fear of
constant reprisals. Aid workers worry that the international
community made a fatal error by treating the end of the war as a
triumph of the Albanians over the Serbs, thus creating an

   DIVIDED KOSOVO: In the spring, the Serbs sought to drive ethnic
Albanians from Kosovo. Since NATO troops rolled into the province,
the Albanians have been returning the favor, killing hundreds of
Serbs and burning their houses and driving them out. Now the Serbs
as well as Gypsies are a vulnerable population who live in fear of
constant reprisals. Aid workers worry that the international
community made a fatal error by treating the end of the war as a
triumph of the Albanians over the Serbs, thus creating an
environment that emboldened revenge-seeking Albanians.

   GERMANY-KOHL (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Former Chancellor Helmut
Kohl admitted Tuesday that he had used a system of secret accounts
to receive donations to his Christian Democrats but rejected
charges he had been bribed during his 16 years in office. By Edmund
L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   MALAYSIA-ELECT (Kuala Lumpur) _ An election folo: ``We have
achieved whatever we have achieved according to the Sinatra
principle,'' Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said shortly before
winning a new five-year term on Monday. ``We have done it our own
way.'' By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (``w'' code)
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-PLAYBOY (Washington) _ The Supreme Court hears arguments
in a First Amendment case involving obscenity, scrambling, and
cable television. The Playboy Entertainment Group wants to be able
to show its material without fully scrambling it all day long; the
government wants to restore a law that restricts such programs to
the hours between 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>

   FDA-GENES-FOOD (Washington) _ The FDA has a second meeting to
hear views on how it should regulate genetically modified foods.
The first was in Chicago. This Washington meeting is expected to
attract many of the most vocal advocacy groups. By Marian Burros.

   CLINTON-BRADY (San Francisco) _ President Clinton, at a Stop the

</P>

   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO-EXPELL-EDUC (Chicago) _ Beyond an intolerance for
weapons and drugs, a new ethos on conduct in American education has
profoundly changed views on what is normal, if annoying, behavior
by adolescents. No longer is the playground scrap or the kickball
tussle deemed a rite of passage, best to be settled by a stern
teacher who orders the pugilists to their corners, hears out the
warring sides, and then demands apologies and a handshake. Known
most often as the ``zero tolerance'' code, aggression is viewed as
violence, and teachers are instructed to file a report with the
school authorities, so that a uniform policy can run its course,
and no offending student escapes punishment. While proponents of
the stringent policies say uniform rules are necessary to insure
safe schools, some educators and psychologists have raised concerns
that common sense has sometimes been a casualty in a crusade for
safety and non-violent behavior. By Dirk Johnson.

like a Senate candidate on Tuesday, blasting the city's policy of
arresting the homeless. Without mentioning her opponent's name at a
breakfast with ministers in New York, she called the policy
inhumane. By Jonathan P. Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINANCIAL &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   BOEING-AIRBUS (Undated) _ Ever since Frontier Airlines started
in 1993, it has flown airplanes made by Boeing. But last month,
Frontier decided to swap its entire fleet of20 737's for jets made
by Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that is Boeing's sole
rival. After training its pilots and mechanics to fly and maintain
its new Airbus planes, it is unlikely that Frontier will buy
another Boeing jet for at least a generation. Boeing is losing many
orders like Frontier's. So far this year, Airbus has outsold Boeing
by more than 2 to 1. The lopsided orders have prompted many in the
aviation industry and on Wall Street to consider what would have
been unthinkable a decade ago: Boeing is in danger of slipping
behind Airbus. And such a decline would echo far beyond Boeing's
Seattle headquarters. The company is the nation's single-largest
exporter, and a weakened Boeing could revive trade tensions between
the European Union and Washington. By Laurence Zuckerman.

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``DESERT'' &QL; 
Photos by Jack Dykinga, text by Janice Emily Bowers (Abrams,
$49.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This book offers lots of pretty photographs of the Mojave Desert
in which Dykinga seems to concede (appearances on the cover
notwithstanding) that not everything in the rural Southwest is
fluorescent orange. The big draw for us, however, is Janice Emily
Bowers, who lives near Tucson and who has written lovely essays
(``A Full Life in a Small Place'') about the natural wonders there.
Both writer and photographer were assisted by the rains &QL; 
of El Nino during the winter of 1997-1998, which brought the desert
into abundant bloom and made their jobs even more pleasurable than
they'd expected them to be. Tourists came from far away to see the
flowers that spring, many for the first time. Bowers envied them.
``The first time of seeing the desert in bloom is almost painful in
its intensity,'' she writes, ``as if every flower were a needle
piercing your skin or a chunk of ice pressed onto your flesh. I
wanted to join that spring, as if it were a circus, and travel with
it forever.'' She acknowledges that this book might attract more
tourists, which increases her concern over the beautiful,
vulnerable desert. Are the crowds good or bad? ``Sometimes,'' she
writes, ``I don't know which group worries me most: the millions
who visit or the millions who stay away.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``ATLANTIS FOUND'' &QL; 
By Clive Cussler (Putnam, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is what Clive Cussler says about his appeal as a writer:
``I give people what they want. My books are like an old Saturday
afternoon matinee with easily identifiable characters: the big
rugged hero; the shrewd heroine (who is never a bimbo); the nasty
villain who gets it in the end . . . I never mean for it to be
anything more than entertainment.'' His sprawling novel features
his recurring big rugged hero, Dirk Pitt, who is supremely capable
and ever manly but a bit on the stiff side (he's like James Bond
without the panache). His shrewd heroine who isn't a bimbo is Pat
O'Connell, an expert in ancient languages. And the villains? There
are so many, and they fall all over themselves trying to kill
O'Connell and her colleagues and then Pitt, who makes a Bond-like
entrance and rescues them from drowning in flooded tunnels under a
mountain in Colorado. One of the assassins shows up in a ninja suit
and a ski mask, and even though he has a chest wound and is
bleeding from the mouth, he calmly discusses his motives with Pitt
before swallowing a cyanide capsule _ a Saturday matinee touch if
we've ever seen one. The plot here is impossible to describe
because it's more a collection of parts than a cohesive whole.
Among the elements: a comet that crashed into the Earth 9,000 years
ago; a frozen ghost ship discovered near the South Pole in 1858; an
underground chamber with inscriptions on its walls and a black
skull on a pedestal; a Nazi U-boat that attacks Pitt's research
vessel; and a cameo appearance by Cussler himself (a Hitchcockian
tradition that he has added to his novels). We'll let you guess who
triumphs before the final credits roll.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WITH WILDER'' &QL; 
By Cameron Crowe (Knopf, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is a wonderful book, not just for film buffs but for those
of us who believe in preserving the stories of people who have had
long and eventful lives. That's an understated description of
director Billy Wilder, of course, but it's the spirit in which this
volume was written. In 1995, Crowe, who had adapted his book ``Fast
Times at Ridgemont High'' for film and had written and directed
``Say Anything,'' approached Wilder and asked the 89-year-old
director to play a bit part in his next movie, ``Jerry Maguire.''
Wilder said no, even when Crowe came back with Tom Cruise, who
turned on the high beams and begged. Crowe wrote about Wilder's
rebuff for ``Rolling Stone.'' Wilder read and liked the story, and
he agreed to an interview with Crowe, a project that expanded to
become this book. In question-and-answer format, Wilder talks about
working with actors (Jack Lemmon, Gary Cooper, Audrey Hepburn,
Marilyn Monroe, Cary Grant, Barbara Stanwyck, Greta Garbo), his
films (``Some Like It Hot,'' ``The Apartment,'' ``Ace in the
Hole,'' ``Sunset Boulevard''), other directors and his big
inspiration, Ernst Lubitsch. There are anecdotes on every page, and
no pretense in sight. The interviews, conducted by Crowe with the
persistence of a journalist and the giddy curiosity of a fan, took
place over more than a year, ending in 1998, when Wilder was 91. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``A PASSION FOR BOOKS'' &QL; 
Edited by Harold Rabinowitz and Rob Kaplan (Times, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an essay written in 1981, Anatole Broyard laments the fact
that his friends borrow his books because he has more than most
people, never mind that ``I feel about lending a book the way most
fathers feel about their daughters living with a man out of
wedlock.'' Robertson Davies writes about the idiosyncrasies of book
collecting. Anna Quindlen offers a list of ``The Ten Books One
Would Save in a Fire, If One Could Save Only Ten.'' John Updike
bemoans the gray fluff of book envelopes. Robert Benchley wonders
why no one collects his books (this was in 1934 _ things have
changed). Norman Mailer names his favorite American novels: not one
of them was written by him. This collection is for people who know
what Peter Hamill was talking about when he said this: ``There are
10,000 books in my library, and it will keep growing until I die.
This has exasperated my daughters, amused my friends, and baffled
my accountant. If I had not picked up this habit in the library
long ago, I would have more money in the bank today. I would not be
richer.'' &QL;

`INVISIBLE UNIVERSE' COLORS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT PERCEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
REVIEW OF: ``The Invisible Universe'' 
 By David Malin (Bullfinch, $50 until Dec. 31, $60 after)  
 
 
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Invisible Universe'' is a beautiful book of astronomical
photographs. It is the size, if not of a coffee table, at least of
a good-size end table. Inside are some of the most ravishing
pictures of the heavens that you will ever see.
</P>
<P>
   The book concentrates on deep-sky objects and nebulae, one photo
to a page, with text on the facing page explaining what we are
looking at.
</P>
<P>
   There are rosy rings of hydrogen gas, blasting inconceivable
distances from a former supernova; there are sooty bags of black
dust blocking out bits of background glow; there are swirling
spiral galaxies twisting their way through the emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   All of it in a color as intense as an ``Arizona Highways''
magazine sunset. You cannot even browse through this book and not
come away with the feeling that the universe is heartbreakingly
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it raises some interesting issues concerning our
assumptions about our own perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have been raised recently, in such places as
``Discover'' magazine, about the accuracy of the space photos we
love to gawk at. Many of the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration pictures of the solar system _ and even the recently
celebrated ``Pillars of Creation'' photo of the Eagle Nebula in the
constellation Serpens _ are printed in an exaggerated false color.
</P>
<P>
   The colors are used diagrammatically. Imagine your high-school
class photo, for instance, in which all the students taller than 6
feet are colored blue, and all those under 5 feet are colored red,
with those in between colored yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Such a picture would not be an accurate representation of the
way the scene looked, but it would provide useful information to
someone who needed that information.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the NASA photos are coded that way with the colors to
aid the scientists using them. It makes visible what is invisible
on a planet's surface _ like the winds of Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Such color is useful to astronomers interested in studying the
internal structure of the nebula, but creates a false impression of
what the phenomenon might look like to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Author David Malin, who took the photographs in ``The Invisible
Universe,'' is touchy on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color photographs reproduced here are the colors of
nature, too faint to be seen and too diluted to be captured on
color film, but real nonetheless,'' he writes in a technical note
concerning the difficulty of arriving at ``true'' color in
astronomical photography.
</P>
<P>
   But his claim begs the question: If the colors of nature are too
faint to be seen, how can he claim that they are the ``true
colors''? Are they the colors we would see if they weren't too
faint? But they ARE``'' faint. Then, what makes them real?
</P>
<P>
   I must assume that he means that they are the colors we would
see if the Earth were very close to them instead of very far away,
so that they would be brighter and we could actually see the
colors. But because they are far away, Malin is essentially
synthesizing what color he believes they would appear to be if we
could somehow UPS the solar system next door to the nebula.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that color vision, as it has developed in human
beings, is not quite what we all think it is. Color vision is a
complicated evolutionary development, and it evolved in a specific
ecological niche for a specific purpose.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to get too technical here, but when a scientist
talks about color, he is usually talking about the spectrum. That
is, to him, light is a wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum.
A small portion of that full electromagnetic spectrum is visible to
humans as light. Red is at the longer-wavelength end and blue at
the shorter-wavelength end.
</P>
<P>
   But human vision doesn't react exactly to the discrete
wavelengths, but is in fact generated from three fuzzy points on
that spectrum and rebuilt in the brain to simulate the full
spectrum. Human vision is a miracle of generalizing from the
fragment to the whole.
</P>
<P>
   And therefore, it is, in itself a version of ``false color.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Malin makes a leap of faith between the spectral colors he
captures on film and the regenerated synthesis of color inside the
brain and assumes they are equal.
</P>
<P>
   Red-violet, for instance (or more technically, magenta) does not
even exist as a wavelength. Yet we see it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Further, our eyes are only dimly sensitive to color. We see
black and white a great deal more acutely than we see color. And in
dim light, the black and white kicks in and the color tends to drop
out.
</P>
<P>
   That means that such incredibly dim deep-sky objects as nebulae
are seen by the human eye in the monochrome of low-light vision.
Nebulae have no color at all (or more precisely, we see them in a
blue-green monochrome, because that is how our brains are wired).
</P>
<P>
   So, the long time-exposure photographs make ``visible'' what is
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   All of which make Malin's claim of true color not a lie, but too
simple.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other problems, too. Film, even the black and
white film that Malin used to construct his color pictures, suffers
from something called reciprocity failure. That is, the sensitivity
of the film is distorted during long exposures and when taking
three photographs through three different color filters to
synthesize the color, the exposures must differ to accommodate the
filters and the reciprocity failure. This makes the result always
somewhat iffy.
</P>
<P>
   I raise all these issues not to denigrate Malin's book, which I
love, but to remind us once again that even such a simple
proposition as what the world _ and the universe _ ``look like'' is
not as settled as we think.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live our lives with the maxim, ``seeing is
believing,'' and we tend to be smug about the accuracy of our sense
data. Scientists can measure spectral color, but the color we see
is something different. It is purely subjective.
</P>
<P>
   And as with relativity and quantum mechanics, we don't notice
the discrepancies at the scale of our day-to-day lives, but when we
reach the very large and the very small, the assumptions of our
perceptions break down. And, if we have any sense, we shrivel in
humility. &QL;

 &HT;    ANOTHER HEAVY HURRICANE YEAR EXPECTED TO FOLLOW THIS ONE
 &HT;    CHART BELOW
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This year's hurricane season, which officially
ended Tuesday, was busier than usual, said James Baker,
administrator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, and similar activity is expected next year.
</P>
<P>
   Since the hurricane season began June 1, there were 12 tropical
storms, eight of which became hurricanes, including and five major
hurricanes _ Category 3 and higher. A Category 3 storm has winds of
at least 111 miles per hour. This year's hurricanes claimed 76
lives, and cost about $4.3 billion in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, also an active hurricane season, there were 14
tropical storms, 10 of which became hurricanes, including three
major hurricanes costing $7.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Floyd, which posed a serious threat to Florida and the
Carolinas in September with winds up to 155 mph, killed 57 people
and was the deadliest storm since Hurricane Agnes killed 122 people
in 1972. Floyd ranked as the 20th deadliest U.S. hurricane in the
century.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Hurricane Irene battered Cuba and the Florida Keys
with winds of 110 mph and caused the indirect deaths of eight
people. Irene dumped torrential rains of up to 20 inches on Dade
and Broward counties, causing urban flooding and $800 million in
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurricanes Floyd and Irene are cruel reminders that hurricanes
can produce tragic loss of life and devastating economic
disruption,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   The best predictor of hurricanes is the impact of El Nino and La
Nina. El Nino is a disruption of ocean atmosphere systems in the
Pacific Ocean resulting in warmer waters in the Pacific Ocean,
while La Nina produces colder waters in the Pacific Ocean. As the
colder waters of the Pacific Ocean shift, a change in the
atmospheric winds occurs that generates the formation of hurricanes
in the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The annual average of hurricanes has increased over the past
five years, said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane
Center. While officials have been largely successful in predicting
hurricane tracks, they still lack the tools to forecast rapid
changes in a hurricane's intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Inland flooding remains the leading cause of hurricane deaths
and damages. Jarrell said better education about hurricane flooding
and reviews of evacuation routes is needed to reduce future
hurricane devastation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ One recent night, a friend and I popped
into a new basement nightclub here called Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
   It is the rage. This is obvious because it is filled with smoke,
loud music and young fashionable people dressed predictably in
black. Each night at around 11 Zanzibar fills with pretty men and
women equipped with an apparently endless supply of German marks.
In a subtle form of rebellion, people in Pristina don't use dinars
_ the official Yugoslavian currency _ even though Kosovo province
remains part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Each night is a celebration, a victory party. It has been nearly
five months since NATO's bombers drove Serb forces out of Kosovo.
Pristina is Kosovo's biggest city and nominal capital. It is filled
with ecstasy _ a hint of what it must have been like in Paris after
the liberation near the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It was jazz night at the Zanzibar, which is owned by a ranking
member of the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA _ a
terrorist gang in the view of Yugoslav government leaders in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   We sit at a small table surrounded by Albanian kids in their
20s. As the trio _ bass guitar, drums and saxophone _ crank up, I
notice something familiar about the sax player. He's a tall, thin
man in his late 20s or early 30s. At the moment he is transported
from this bar on soaring notes of music both sweet and agonizing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I remember him. Last March, a few days after NATO war
planes began bombing, I travelled to the remote mountain border
crossing between Kosovo and neighboring Albania. It was near a town
called Kukes on the Albanian side. We had heard that thousands of
refugees were moving toward the Albanian border. It was the
beginning of the huge exodus that played each night on televisions
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Early one morning after I arrived, the flood began to choke the
border crossing. I had stationed myself on the bridge between
Albania and Kosovo to speak to refugees as they came over. In the
crowd, was this guy wearing a black leather jacket and sunglasses.
He was hip. His English was stunning. He said he was from Pristina,
and said he had been forced to leave his home by armed Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The memory is clear as I watch the same guy playing at Zanzibar.
Small world. The sound of the sax is rich and flowing. The notes
hang in the smoky air. He is in a league far above the bass player
and drummer. They are playing at the music _ he feels. Few art
forms allow you to express the sensation of freedom better than
jazz. The music isn't held back by written notes. The player goes
by instinct, and he takes us with him.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds are American, even though the sax player had never
been to the United States. He is a Muslim from Eastern Europe, a
tremendous cultural distance from the basements of Chicago, New
Orleans and Memphis where jazz was born. Yet, he is playing music
from my country as I could only dream of playing it.
</P>
<P>
   That day last spring on the bridge, I was touched by what was
happening to these people. The sax player had two brothers in the
KLA. He has confronted death, forced eviction from his homeland and
a million things I can only imagine. Yet, he could be someone on
any street in America.
</P>
<P>
   During a break in the music, I see Visar, the KLA guy who owns
Zanzibar, working the sound system in the back of the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds great,'' I tell him.
</P>
<P>
   Visar smiles at me. During the NATO campaign, we used to have a
beer in the Rogner Hotel in Tirana, Albania. We would watch CNN and
talk about the Albanians' war on the Serbs. I never admitted this
to Visar, but I was never convinced that the United States and its
allies were right to pick a side in this ancient feud. The vicious
assaults on Serbs by Albanians since the
</P>
<P>
   refugees came home only make me more dubious. It's a little sad
that there aren't any Serbs at Zanzibar to hear the music.
</P>
<P>
   But the night is full of jazz, and for the moment it seems like
something worth fighting for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Visar says. ``It sounds like freedom.''

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ One recent night, a friend and I popped
into a new basement nightclub here called Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
   It is the rage. This is obvious because it is filled with smoke,
loud music and young fashionable people dressed predictably in
black. Each night at around 11 Zanzibar fills with pretty men and
women equipped with an apparently endless supply of German marks.
In a subtle form of rebellion, people in Pristina don't use dinars
_ the official Yugoslavian currency _ even though Kosovo province
remains part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Each night is a celebration, a victory party. It has been nearly
five months since NATO's bombers drove Serb forces out of Kosovo.
Pristina is Kosovo's biggest city and nominal capital. It is filled
with ecstasy _ a hint of what it must have been like in Paris after
the liberation near the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It was jazz night at the Zanzibar, which is owned by a ranking
member of the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA _ a
terrorist gang in the view of Yugoslav government leaders in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   We sit at a small table surrounded by Albanian kids in their
20s. As the trio _ bass guitar, drums and saxophone _ crank up, I
notice something familiar about the sax player. He's a tall, thin
man in his late 20s or early 30s. At the moment he is transported
from this bar on soaring notes of music both sweet and agonizing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I remember him. Last March, a few days after NATO war
planes began bombing, I travelled to the remote mountain border
crossing between Kosovo and neighboring Albania. It was near a town
called Kukes on the Albanian side. We had heard that thousands of
refugees were moving toward the Albanian border. It was the
beginning of the huge exodus that played each night on televisions
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Early one morning after I arrived, the flood began to choke the
border crossing. I had stationed myself on the bridge between
Albania and Kosovo to speak to refugees as they came over. In the
crowd, was this guy wearing a black leather jacket and sunglasses.
He was hip. His English was stunning. He said he was from Pristina,
and said he had been forced to leave his home by armed Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The memory is clear as I watch the same guy playing at Zanzibar.
Small world. The sound of the sax is rich and flowing. The notes
hang in the smoky air. He is in a league far above the bass player
and drummer. They are playing at the music _ he feels. Few art
forms allow you to express the sensation of freedom better than
jazz. The music isn't held back by written notes. The player goes
by instinct, and he takes us with him.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds are American, even though the sax player had never
been to the United States. He is a Muslim from Eastern Europe, a
tremendous cultural distance from the basements of Chicago, New
Orleans and Memphis where jazz was born. Yet, he is playing music
from my country as I could only dream of playing it.
</P>
<P>
   That day last spring on the bridge, I was touched by what was
happening to these people. The sax player had two brothers in the
KLA. He has confronted death, forced eviction from his homeland and
a million things I can only imagine. Yet, he could be someone on
any street in America.
</P>
<P>
   During a break in the music, I see Visar, the KLA guy who owns
Zanzibar, working the sound system in the back of the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds great,'' I tell him.
</P>
<P>
   Visar smiles at me. During the NATO campaign, we used to have a
beer in the Rogner Hotel in Tirana, Albania. We would watch CNN and
talk about the Albanians' war on the Serbs. I never admitted this
to Visar, but I was never convinced that the United States and its
allies were right to pick a side in this ancient feud. The vicious
assaults on Serbs by Albanians since the
</P>
<P>
   refugees came home only make me more dubious. It's a little sad
that there aren't any Serbs at Zanzibar to hear the music.
</P>
<P>
   But the night is full of jazz, and for the moment it seems like
something worth fighting for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Visar says. ``It sounds like freedom.''

QUICK TRIP TO TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shish Kebab is a quintessential Turkish dish, but this twist on
the classic combination of lamb and peppers takes a great idea and
makes it easier. First of all, this dish can be made indoors,
although in good weather the initial browning could certainly be
done on a grill. Second, it makes its own sauce, a combination of
yogurt and the juices exuded by the meat and roasted vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   The process could not be more straightforward: You first quickly
sear large chunks of lamb. Then, you roast peppers _ a combination
of sweet and hot is ideal but not essential _ along with an onion.
Those few ingredients are all combined with yogurt, then browned
under the broiler. It's a one-dish meal with only three steps.
</P>
<P>
   For the lamb, you can use either leg or shoulder. Meat from the
leg is leaner and best kept on the rare side; shoulder meat, which
has more fat, can be cooked a little longer without drying out,
which means it can be left under the broiler for a few extra
minutes to give it an extra-crisp crust.
</P>
<P>
   As for the peppers, any assortment of sweet bell peppers is
fine, red or yellow. One or two mildly hot peppers, like Anaheim
chilies, make the dish more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The technique is not difficult, although searing the lamb
produces prodigious amounts of smoke. It takes only a couple of
minutes, though, so just turn on an exhaust fan and temporarily
disconnect the smoke detector. The smoke produced by the peppers as
they are seared is pleasantly fragrant.
</P>
<P>
   I have kept this dish as simple as possible, but there are a few
other ingredients that can improve it, if marginally. You can add a
couple of skinned tomatoes; just sear them with or after the
peppers. This takes only a minute or two and adds another level of
flavor to the final sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Another addition might be a teaspoon or so of thyme leaves along
with the yogurt. A sprinkling of fresh lemon juice or chopped mint
after cooking will also heighten the flavors. And finally, this
dish is best served with either rice or good pita bread, but lots
of either.
</P>
<P>
   LAMB WITH PEPPERS AND YOGURT SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds boneless lamb, cut into 2-inch chunks
</P>
<P>
   3 bell peppers, red, yellow or a combination
</P>
<P>
   2 or 3 chilies, optional
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, peeled and cut in half
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 cups plain yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   1. Turn heat to high under a cast-iron or other heavy, large
skillet. A couple of minutes later, add lamb and quickly sear on
all sides. Don't worry about cooking it through, but brown the
exterior well.
</P>
<P>
   2. Remove lamb and put peppers and chilies in skillet, still
over high heat. Add onion halves, cut sides down. Cook until
peppers blacken on all sides, turning as necessary (the onion will
blacken quickly; remove it and set aside). When the peppers are
beginning to collapse, after 10 to 15 minutes, remove skillet from
heat and cover with foil or a lid. Preheat broiler, and adjust rack
so it is as close to the heat source as possible.
</P>
<P>
   3. When peppers cool slightly, peel and seed them, then cut or
tear them into strips. Separate the onion into rings. Combine with
lamb, salt, pepper and yogurt in a roasting pan just large enough
to hold meat in one layer. Broil until charred on top, just a few
minutes, then serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

CRISPY SEARED STRIPED BASS 
</HEADLINE>
   This is the fourth of eight columns by Patrick O'Connell, the chef
and an owner of the Inn at Little Washington in Washington, Va.
They are written with Marian Burros.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans are sometimes reluctant to eat fish with the skin on.
But cooking a fish fillet with the skin attached has some distinct
advantages. The skin helps keep the flesh moist, reduces shrinkage
and provides a tantalizing textural contrast.
</P>
<P>
   Weighting the fish fillet while cooking it skin side down
results in a skin as crispy as Peking duck. It takes a little
practice adjusting the heat of the pan and using just the right
amount of oil to achieve the perfect results, but mastering this
technique is well worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   This dish has definite Asian overtones but uses a classic French
sauce-making method. Sugar is melted and caramelized over heat,
then vinegar is added and reduced, followed by chicken stock. This
reduced caramel-vinegar syrup is called a gastrique and was often
used in dishes pairing fruit and game, like duck a l'orange or
rabbit with prunes, to create a depth of flavor and sweet-and-sour
notes.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation is simple yet dazzling. The fillet is leaned up
against the braised bok choy bulb, and the honey-colored sauce is
dribbled over the fish and around it in a ring. Tatsoi shoots
(miniature Asian sprouts with a peppery flavor) or snipped chives
are scattered around the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The tender braised baby bok choy placed under the fillet
provides a good contrast to the crispy skin and balances out the
sweetness in the dish. If baby bok choy is not available, regular
bok choy, sliced on the bias, may be substituted.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian aspect of the dish is reinforced by briefly marinating
the flesh side of the fish with a simple mixture of soy sauce,
ginger and garlic before cooking. The fish is only marinated on the
flesh side because the skin absorbs very little of the marinade and
must be dry in order to crisp properly. If you're in a hurry, you
can forget the marinade and bok choy _ just place the crispy fish
on some delicate raw salad greens and drizzle the sauce on the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the skin crackling crisp is the challenge; the joke in
our kitchen is that it should be so crisp that the guest had better
have dental insurance. It's important to get the oil very hot
before adding the fish. We use grape-seed oil because it has a
higher smoking point than other oils, but peanut or safflower oil
also work. Olive oil is not recommended.
</P>
<P>
   The fish used here is referred to in our area as rockfish, a
regional name for striped bass. We used to be limited to serving it
only at certain times of year, when we could get it from the
Chesapeake Bay. Now, we are lucky to have someone raising rockfish
in a pond near the inn, who brings them to us still alive.

<P>
   CRISPY SEARED STRIPED BASS ON BRAISED BABY BOK CHOY WITH
SWEET-AND-SOUR SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   For the sweet-and-sour sauce:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   { cup seasoned rice wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   [ cup V8 juice
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fish sauce (Vietnamese nuoc mam or Thai nam pla)
</P>
<P>
   For the braised bok choy:
</P>
<P>
   3 bulbs baby bok choy
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons grape-seed oil
</P>
<P>
   \ cup white wine
</P>
<P>
   \ cup vegetable stock or water
</P>
<P>
   Salt and black pepper
</P>
<P>
   For the striped bass:
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely grated ginger
</P>
<P>
   2 scallions, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sherry vinegar
</P>
<P>
   { cup soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 generous pinch cayenne
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds striped bass fillets, scaled, skin on and pin bones
removed, cut into rectangles about 1{ by 2{ inches
</P>
<P>
   Sliced chives or tatsoi shoots (available at Asian produce
markets), for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare the sweet-and-sour sauce: in a medium saucepan,
combine sugar and vinegar. Place over medium heat, and simmer,
stirring constantly, until mixture turns a rich amber color, 10 to
15 minutes. Remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add V8 juice a little at a time. Return pan to heat, and
reduce sauce to a syrupy consistency. Remove from heat, and add
lemon juice and fish sauce. If a thinner consistency is desired,
add water a drop or two at a time. (Sauce may be made a day ahead
of time and reheated.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Prepare bok choy: preheat oven to 400 degrees. Remove and
discard outer leaves, and split bulbs in half lengthwise. In a
large saute pan over medium-high heat, bring grape-seed oil to
smoking point. Add bok choy, cut side down, and sear until golden,
1 or 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. Add wine and stock to pan. Stir gently with a wooden spoon,
scraping bottom of pan. Transfer pan to oven, and cook until bulbs
are tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
(Bok choy may be prepared the night before and reheated in a
microwave oven.)
</P>
<P>
   5. Prepare marinade for bass: in a large mixing bowl, combine
garlic, ginger, scallions, sesame oil, olive oil, lemon juice,
vinegar, soy sauce and cayenne. Stir well. (Marinade may be
prepared a day in advance.)
</P>
<P>
   6. To assemble: place fish fillets in marinade for 2 to 4
minutes. Remove, and drain well on paper towels. Season to taste
with salt and pepper. Place a large nonstick saute pan over high
heat, and bring to smoking point. Add fish to pan, skin side down.
After about 30 seconds, lower heat to medium. Place another heavy
pan on top of fish so that it stays flat in pan and the skin will
crisp. Cook 3 or 4 minutes, then remove top pan and turn fish
pieces over. Cook 20 to 45 seconds on flesh side.
</P>
<P>
   7. On each of six warm plates, place one halved bulb of bok
choy. Place equal amounts of fish fillet, skin side up, on each
plate. Drizzle each plate with sweet-and-sour sauce, and garnish
with a sprinkling of chives or tatsoi shoots. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings as a first course, 3 servings as a main
course.

FOOD QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blending Butter and Margarine
</P>
<P>
   Q. For my holiday baking, can I use butter and margarine mixed
together in a cookie recipe? I like the flavor of butter, but
margarine makes the dough easier to handle.
</P>
<P>
   A. Not only can you do this, it can be a very good idea in many
cases. Since margarine remains malleable over a wide range of
temperatures, a dough made with it can be rolled, cut out and
re-rolled without becoming tough. On the other hand, butter can
melt and will seep into the cookie dough when handled, making it
greasy and hard to work with.
</P>
<P>
   Margarine can be substituted for butter one for one. But using
some margarine in heavily seasoned cookies, such as spice or
chocolate, will be less noticeable than in delicate sugar or
shortbread cookies. These cookies' flavor relies on butter's rich
taste, so if you want to substitute, it is better to use
proportionately more butter than margarine.
</P>
<P>
   For Persimmons, Soft Is Good
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am intrigued by the shape and color of persimmons, but how
do you eat them? Their flavor is very pleasant, but they leave a
residue in the mouth. Is there a correct way to prepare the fruit
to avoid that? Also, I have heard that the skin of a persimmon
should not be eaten. Is it poisonous?
</P>
<P>
   A. There is nothing poisonous about a persimmon (Diospyros
kaki), a fruit that originated in China. About 500 varieties are
grown in the United States, but the plump, deep-orange,
acorn-shaped Hachiya is cultivated most abundantly. The name
``persimmon'' comes from a bite-sized fruit in the same genus that
is native to America and was gathered and eaten by the Algonquins.
These so-called ``wild persimmons'' still grow in some parts of the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   That unpleasant feeling in the mouth occurs only when eating
underripe persimmons. Even a slightly underripe one can be mouth
puckering, since the fruit contains a good amount of tannins. When
buying a persimmon, look for one that feels very soft, almost like
custard beneath the skin when you gently squeeze it.
</P>
<P>
   You can ripen persimmons at home by placing them in a paper bag
with a banana or an apple to expose the fruit to ethylene fumes.
They should take three to six days to fully ripen, and once ripe
they must be eaten immediately. One variety of persimmon, the
tannin-free Fuyu, can be eaten at any stage of ripeness. It is
flatter _ almost tomato-shaped _ and lighter in color than the
ubiquitous Hachiya, and is sold in specialty markets, where it is
sometimes called Sharon fruit.
</P>
<P>
   With their spicy, jam-like flesh, persimmons are a treat and
require no special preparation. Give them a rinse before eating out
of hand either unpeeled or peeled, or slicing into fruit salads.
You can also puree the soft, sweet flesh and use it in cakes, quick
breads, puddings, mousses, candies, fruit shakes, sorbets and ice
cream. Pureed persimmon can be frozen for up to six months, so if
you have several fruit that ripen at the same time, save them.
</P>
<P>
   The Color of Egg Money
</P>
<P>
   Q. I thought brown eggs were the same as white eggs, but they
cost so much more. Are they better for you, or is this marketing
hype?  &QL; 
A: You're right; brown eggs and white eggs differ only in color and
are nutritional and culinary equals. Brown eggs come from brown
hens (the most common breed is the Rhode Island Red) and white eggs
come from white hens. But in her book ``Cookwise,'' Shirley
Corriher, a food scientist, writes that the most accurate way to
determine the color of eggs a hen will lay is to examine her ears.
White ears guarantee white eggs, reddish brown predict brown eggs.
(A special breed of Araucana hen comes in many hues, from dusty
pink to slate grey, and lay pale green or blue eggs.)
</P>
<P>
   As for the disparity in prices, Linda Braun, consumer service
director of the American Egg Board, attributes this to the fact
that brown hens are slightly bigger than white ones and therefore
require more feed.
</P>
<P>
   Discard Chipped Enamel Pots
</P>
<P>
   Q. I chipped the enamel inside my favorite stewing pot. Is it
safe to use? A. Enamel-coated pots and pans, no matter what the
material beneath the coating, should not be used if they are
chipped. In most cases, the material used to bond the underside of
the enamel to the metal is toxic and should not come in contact
with food. One way to keep enamel-coated pots and pans from
chipping is to wash them by hand rather than in the dishwasher,
where abrasive detergents can wear down the linings.

   One striking characteristic of the American palate at the end of
the century is its preference for more assertive flavors over bland
ones. People now favor red wine over white, fiery salsas over
ketchup, espresso over the standard morning blend and very dark
chocolate over milk chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes for the greens we eat. In a gradual shift during
the last 15 years, we have moved well past iceberg lettuce and
spinach. I remember that when I first moved to New York in 1981, I
ordered broccoli di rape in an Italian restaurant and found myself
deep in conversation with the owner, who was excited that this
green was becoming the darling of cooked greens. From a few
portions a week, he said, he was now serving 10 to 15 a day.
</P>
<P>
   If you go to a New York City Greenmarket or a specialty food
store today, you will find not only the greens beloved by
Southerners, like collards and mustard, but also those that have
always been sold in Asian markets, like mizuna and tat soi, as well
as the latest Italian green to reach our shores, Tuscan kale (which
is also known as cavolo nero or black kale, and is actually a deep,
deep green).
</P>
<P>
   What all these dark, leafy greens have in common is a piquancy
that appeals to jaded palates in search of something new, something
challenging. They may have a slightly bitter edge, an earthy
intensity or a surprisingly mellow sweet flavor. They can be
divided according to taste; here, by category, are some of the best
known:
</P>
<P>
   Bitter: chicory, dandelions, escarole, broccoli di rape,
radicchio.
</P>
<P>
   Earthy: collards, kale, fully grown mustard and turnip greens.
</P>
<P>
   Peppery: arugula, watercress, young mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet: Swiss chard, lamb's-quarters, beet greens, spinach.
</P>
<P>
   All these greens are cruciferous vegetables belonging to the
genus brassica. Some people may recall that, in first learning
about cruciferous vegetables, they were praised for their
anti-oxidant properties, which may help prevent cancer.
</P>
<P>
   While there will always be some who eat cruciferous vegetables
because of their nutritional value, even if they have to hold their
noses, most people reach for leafy greens today because they like
the taste. That these greens come with important doses of nutrients
is serendipitous.
</P>
<P>
   They are high in vitamins C and E as well as beta carotene. In
addition, the darker ones are important sources of folic acid,
which may help prevent certain birth defects. They are also good
sources of iron and calcium, and some have potassium.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that many of us hated the greens we were served as
children is that they were boiled indiscriminately for 20 minutes,
until they were a gray-green mush with a characteristic cabbage
odor that clung to the walls.
</P>
<P>
   While greens don't need a lot of fussing, they deserve a bit
more care than that. Their age dictates the appropriate
preparation. Young ones can simply be sauteed in olive oil with
garlic and a bit of hot red pepper. Older greens need to be boiled
or parboiled to tenderize them and mellow their metallic, bitter or
assertive taste.
</P>
<P>
   Other versions found in various cultures include greens served
with potatoes in a side dish or a soup. And many greens can be used
interchangeably, though most Asian greens are served raw, while
European are usually cooked.
</P>
<P>
   When buying greens, the younger the better. But no matter the
age, avoid those that are limp, wilted, bruised or discolored.
Generally you'll find the freshest and youngest at a Greenmarket.

STARTING A CELLAR: A CLOSET WILL BE FINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One night back in college, a friend of mine discovered classical
music on the radio: something from ``Swan Lake,'' I think, or some
kind of waltz. Chronically afflicted with more money than sense, he
promptly rushed out and bought himself a record library, a
shelf-full of Beethoven, Brahms and Chopin. I doubt if he listened
to any of those records more than once, and some he probably never
played at all.
</P>
<P>
   Fledgling wine lovers have a tendency to act that way when it
comes to storing their wine. The idea of owning a ``cellar,'' of
talking about one's ``cellar,'' is well nigh irresistible, even for
newcomers who cannot yet distinguish a barbera from a beaujolais.
</P>
<P>
   Far be it from me to discourage the gathering in of a goodly
supply of decent wine. Aside from bragging rights and the
fundamental thrill of acquisition, there are entirely sound reasons
for having something more around the house than a bottle or two
stashed under the sink.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there is convenience. Buying wine a bottle at a
time is a nuisance. If you know what you want, and are not
seriously bereft of funds, it takes no longer to buy a case than it
does a bottle. And there is usually a 10 percent discount on a
12-bottle case. If there isn't, ask why.
</P>
<P>
   A case guarantees a measure of consistency. Wine distribution is
haphazard at best, and if your choice is not a popular, commercial
wine, there may be no more of it the next time you shop. Buying a
case also locks in a price, if only for a while. Wine prices these
days climb like ivy on a backyard fence; with a case you know the
last bottle costs the same as the first. Then there is the
ineffable pleasure to be derived from knowing that the end of a
memorable bottle no longer portends the end of the meal or the
mood. There are all those others, awaiting your pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, in states like New York where primitive laws still
bar the sale of wine in supermarkets, you can avoid all those extra
trips to the liquor store for a single bottle.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you've been listening to me, you've concluded that having
a little wine cellar _ or even a big one _ is a nifty idea. You
have also concluded, I'm willing to bet, that it's an expensive
one. It can be: a year or two ago, a newly affluent banker was
dismayed _ slightly _ to learn that recreating the stone floor of a
Burgundy winery in his East Side apartment required shoring up the
entire floor of the building. He did it anyway. The benefits to his
ego: incalculable. To his wine: none.
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, it doesn't have to be this way. Many a good, working
wine ``cellar'' is a spare room or an ample closet high above the
street.
</P>
<P>
   But, you ask, what about temperature control? What about those
formidable wine refrigerators, some with glass doors, no less, that
claim to keep those precious bottles properly cooled? OK, if you've
got precious bottles, buy one. If your wine tastes and, more
important, your wine purse, are more modest, forget the high-ticket
gadgets. They're mostly for show anyway. It's accepted wisdom in
the wine trade that almost all wine is consumed within a year of
its being produced, and 80 percent of the wine purchased in this
country is consumed within two days after leaving the retail shop.
Which means that only a small fraction of the wine made needs
special cellaring.
</P>
<P>
   Well-heeled connoisseurs and would-be connoisseurs, the people
who haunt the auction rooms and who buy wine futures, often install
elaborate cellars to protect their investments. Older wines need
special care because they are fragile and easily affected by
excessive heat, light and vibration. New wines that need extensive
aging will also benefit from special care. But even fine Bordeaux
and Burgundies, if they are to be consumed within three or four
years of their purchase, need no special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A consistent temperature, even if it's 70 degrees, is more
important than a temperature that jumps up and down _ a cellar
that's warm in summer and freezing in winter, for example. A
constant 55 degrees in the cellar of a Bordeaux chateau may be
desirable for wines that will be kept for half a century, but it
serves little purpose in any setting where wine will be consumed in
a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Is wine susceptible to heat damage? Yes, especially during
transportation. Almost everyone in the wine trade has horror
stories about containers of wine left sitting on piers or in
un-air-conditioned warehouses for weeks in temperatures well over
100 degrees. Once, lawsuits over spoiled wine were not uncommon.
Now conscientious importers demand that their best wines be shipped
in refrigerated containers, and very little imported wine arrives
in this country in poor condition. In fact, wine is sturdier stuff
that it might seem to be. And it is made better than it was in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Kept away from bright light, in a space with a constant
temperature not too different from what you require for yourself,
it will last a surprisingly long time. It may age a bit faster in
warmer temperatures, but most wine is drunk too soon, anyway. An
extra year in your hall closet might do wonders for your prized
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   So much for storage space. Next week, we will talk about filling
it. Hint: don't splurge on what you think you should own, like my
college friend and his records. Buy cautiously and buy only what
you like.

A LOW-FAT HANUKKAH, WITH LATKES AND ALL

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some years ago, before carbohydrates became the dietary bugbear,
I was urged by my doctor to go on a low-fat diet. I did fine until
December rolled around, for Hanukkah is unique among Jewish
holidays in that its liturgy involves the consumption of fat.
</P>
<P>
   And it is consumed with a vengeance during the eight-day
Festival of Lights, which this year begins on Friday at sundown.
Israelis delight in soofganiyot, puffy balls of jelly-filled fried
dough similar to American doughnut holes.
</P>
<P>
   Greek Jews eat fried pancakes called tiganites and syrup-soaked
puffs of fried dough known as loukoumades, also called zvingous.
American Jews, following the example of their eastern European
ancestors, revel in potato latkes.
</P>
<P>
   Hanukkah celebrates the victory of a tiny band of Jewish
patriots over a mighty Syrian army in 165 B.C. A tiny cruet of oil,
enough for one night, burned for eight straight days and nights.
Today, Jews light candles in nine-branch menorahs and eat foods
fried in oil. Especially latkes.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't bear the thought of Hanukkah without latkes, made
with grated potatoes, flavored with onion, golden brown and
dripping with oil. The only thing better may be licking your greasy
fingers afterward.
</P>
<P>
   I had already figured out how to make low-fat kreplach
(dumplings, using wonton wrappers instead of egg dough) and even
low-fat chopped liver (by substituting roasted mushrooms for most
of the organ meat). I was not about to be daunted by a latke.
</P>
<P>
   The solution lay in a technique I call ``bake frying.'' I cook
the latkes in a little olive oil, just enough to crisp and brown
them, on a nonstick baking sheet in a 450-degree oven. (Olive oil
is traditional, but more cooks use vegetable oil. Someone somewhere
may fry them in chicken fat, but they could not be served with sour
cream because of the proscription against mixing meat with dairy
products.)
</P>
<P>
   To give my enlightened latkes a richer taste, I use Yukon gold
potatoes, which have a buttery flavor, more so than Idaho potatoes.
Bake-frying works better with smaller pieces of food _ they crisp
better _ so I form my latkes in 2{-inch discs that you can dispatch
in a bite or two.
</P>
<P>
   Bake-fried latkes are lighter and cleaner-tasting than than the
oily potato pancakes. They also make less mess in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The same technique works for sweet potato latkes, which I like
to spice up with cinnamon and nutmeg. Either version can be served
with homemade applesauce and, if you're obsessive, no-fat ``sour
cream.''
</P>
<P>
   A minor but great debate rages over what is the better
accompaniment, applesauce or sour cream. Adherents of the former
emphasize the Eastern European Jewish love of mixing sweet (fruity)
and salty flavors. Sour cream makes for a more savory dish. Ever
ecumenical, my family serves both.
</P>
<P>
   Potato latkes are so enmeshed in American Jewish food culture
that they seem to have existed forever. But the potato latke is a
relatively recent invention, dating to the 16th century, when
potatoes first arrived in central Europe from the New World. Before
that, latkes were made with different vegetables; in parts of
Europe, they still are.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Levy, the author of ``The Low-Fat Jewish Cookbook''
(Clarkson Potter, 1997), takes a slightly different approach, using
corn instead of potatoes, fat-free egg whites and a minimum of oil
in nonstick skillet.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by my success with latkes, I tackled another family
Hanukkah favorite, loukoumades. My Aunt Rosa Miller learned to make
these puffs of deep-fried dough as a child in Greece. The dough
resembles French choux pastry, but with olive oil instead of
butter.
</P>
<P>
   I replaced the eggs in the recipe with egg substitute, which is
almost all egg whites, reduced the oil and baked the loukoumades
instead of frying them. The dough balls puffed and crisped, though
perhaps not as dramatically as the deep-fried originals. But when
you douse them with cinnamon and honey syrup, you get the very
essence of a Greek Hanukkah dessert.
</P>
<P>
   As for soofganiyot, the jelly-filled cousins of the doughnut,
I'm still working.

   LOW-FAT LATKES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds Yukon gold potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup matzoh meal or unbleached white flour
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 cup egg substitute, or 2 eggs plus 4 whites
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil spray
</P>
<P>
   No-fat sour cream (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Applesauce (optional). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Place large nonstick baking sheet in oven, and preheat to 450
degrees. Peel potatoes and onion, and coarsely grate. Squeeze
handfuls of grated vegetables tightly to wring out as much liquid
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   2. Transfer vegetables to mixing bowl, and stir in matzoh meal,
baking powder, egg substitute, parsley and plenty of salt and
pepper. Latkes should be highly seasoned.
</P>
<P>
   3. Spray baking sheet with oil. Spoon small mounds of potato
mixture onto sheet to form pancakes 2{ inches in diameter. Leave 1
inch between each.
</P>
<P>
   4. Bake-fry latkes until bottoms are golden brown, for 8 to 10
minutes. Spray tops of latkes with oil. Turn them, and cook until
tops are golden brown. Repeat with remaining dough. Serve at once
with sour cream or applesauce.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 50 to 60 small latkes; 8 to 10 servings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   APPLESAUCE WITH WINE AND VANILLA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds fragrant apples, like Galas or McIntoshes (6 to 8
apples)
</P>
<P>
   1 cinnamon stick or 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1 2-inch piece vanilla bean, cut in half lengthwise
</P>
<P>
   2 strips lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   1{ tablespoons lemon juice, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   \ cup sugar, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dry white wine. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Wash apples, and cut in half. Remove stems and cores; leave
skins intact. Place apples in large heavy pot with other
ingredients and 2\ cups water. Bring to boil.
</P>
<P>
   2. Reduce heat, and simmer apples, covered, until soft, for 20
to 30 minutes. Remove pan from heat, and let cool slightly. Discard
cinnamon stick and vanilla bean.
</P>
<P>
   3. Puree apples and pan juices in blender or food processor:
blender will yield a silky puree; processor, a chunkier applesauce.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about 4 cups; 8 servings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LOUKOUMADES (GREEK HANUKKAH FRITTERS WITH HONEYED SYRUP) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 20 minutes &QL;

   1 cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   4 cloves
</P>
<P>
   2 strips lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   2 strips orange zest
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Cognac or brandy &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the pastry: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   \ cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup unbleached white flour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup egg substitute, or 2 eggs plus 4 whites lightly beaten
with fork
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon egg substitute or 1 egg white, beaten with a little
salt, for glaze
</P>
<P>
   Cinnamon for sprinkling. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare syrup. In saucepan, combine 1\ cups water with sugar,
honey, cinnamon, cloves and lemon and orange zest, and boil until
thick and syrupy, for about 4 minutes. Strain syrup into bowl, and
cool to room temperature. Add Cognac, stir and refrigerate. Syrup
can be prepared up to a day ahead to this stage.
</P>
<P>
   2. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In heavy saucepan, combine 1 cup
water with oil, lemon zest, salt and sugar, and bring to boil over
high heat. Remove pan from heat, and sift in flour. Stir well with
wooden spoon to make thick paste. Return pan to high heat, and cook
until dough is thick enough to come away from sides of pan in a
smooth ball, for 2 to 4 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add egg substitute in 4 batches, beating vigorously with
wooden spoon until mixture is smooth before adding next batch.
Mixture should resemble soft ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   4. Transfer dough to piping bag fitted with ]-inch round tip.
Pipe 1-inch balls of dough onto nonstick baking sheet lightly
sprayed with oil, leaving 1{ inches between each. (If you don't
have a piping bag, use 2 spoons to drop balls of dough onto sheet.)
Dip a fork in cold water, and with back of tines, smooth top of
each ball. Lightly brush balls with egg glaze. Sprinkle sheet with
few drops of water.
</P>
<P>
   5. Bake dough balls until puffed, firm and nicely browned, for
40 to 50 minutes. If puffs brown too much before they are cooked
through, reduce heat. Remove sheet from oven, and cool for 3
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   6. Using spatula, transfer hot puffs to serving bowl. Pour cold
syrup on top, and let soak for 3 minutes. Serve puffs with syrup in
bowls. Sprinkle with cinnamon.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 32 to 36 puffs; 8 servings. &QL;

<P>
   No season inspires as many festive beers as winter, and with the
millennial excitement this year, the keg is overflowing.
</P>
<P>
   Winter brews come in many guises, some simply flavored with
seasonal spices like cloves and nutmeg. Others are thick, inky
black stouts or powerful brews known as barley wines, which have an
alcohol content of around 12 percent, like wine, rather than the 5
percent more typical of beer.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, seasonal beers can be a real stretch, like pumpkin
ales and coffee-flavored stouts.
</P>
<P>
   Why are celebratory beers so prevalent? Unlike wine, which is at
the mercy of the annual cycle of grape growing and harvesting, beer
can be made at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Its basic components _ water, yeast, grain and hops _ are always
available, and almost all brews are ready to drink within a few
months of their inception.
</P>
<P>
   Beers and ales can be made practically on a whim, and tailored
to almost any occasion.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., one of the best breweries in the
United States, sells its excellent Celebration Ale every winter,
but changes the recipe each year. It's the same with the Boston
Beer Co., which this year has produced a beautifully balanced Sam
Adams Winter Lager.
</P>
<P>
   Like winter stews and roasts, most winter brews are heavier
bodied than the year-round beers. They're meant for sipping with
food or in front of a fire rather than for chugging on the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn Brewery's Black Chocolate Stout would go well with
chocolate desserts, although the name refers to the color of the
roasted barley. The same brewery's Monster Ale pairs well with
Stilton cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Here are seven celebratory examples, from lightest to heaviest.
Four are American.
</P>
<P>
   OTTER CREEK, A WINTER'S ALE _ $8 a six-pack &QL; 
Creamy texture, fruit flavors, like a classic Scotch ale.
</P>
<P>
   NEW ENGLAND HOLIDAY ALE _ $9 a six-pack &QL; 
Smells like a fruitcake and tastes of cloves and cardamom.
</P>
<P>
   GEARY'S SPECIAL HAMPSHIRE ALE _ $9 a six-pack &QL; 
Bright, spicy aroma and an earthy, minty flavor.
</P>
<P>
   BROOKLYN BLACK CHOCOLATE STOUT _ $8 a six-pack &QL; 
Creamy, malty and thick, with a long, smoky finish.
</P>
<P>
   BROOKLYN MONSTER ALE _ $2 a bottle &QL; 
Barley wine, complex and spicy. Perfect as an after-dinner drink.
</P>
<P>
   DUPONT, AVEC LES BON VOEUX _ $6 a bottle &QL;

tolerance'' code, aggression is viewed as violence, and teachers
are typically forbidden from simply resolving any physical dispute

children in a Mexican seaside town in 1998, drug traffickers have
been killing off their rivals, informants and family members of
drug traffickers for decades. The difference is that U.S. citizens
are rarely involved. Although the bodies of U.S. citizens have been
discovered, U.S. authorities have limited authority when helping
Mexican authorities with investigations of such slayings. By MARISA

MY DEAR SIR: LETTERS BY A RELUCTANT COMMANDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: excerpt at beginning of article should be italicized)  
 (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``In confidence I can assure you _ with the world, it would
obtain little credit _ that my movements to the chair of government
will be accompanied by feelings not unlike those of a culprit who
is going to the place of his execution.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is a handwritten letter to a friend, dated April
1, 1789, less than 30 days before the writer would be inaugurated
as the first president of the new United States of America. And
from the first ``My Dear Sir'' to the final scribble of a farewell
_ ``your affectionate, G. Washington'' _ it provides, in its
penmanship and its candor, a telling portrait of a reluctant leader
being pushed into service at a time of great uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's letter to Henry Knox, the first secretary of war,
is one of about 160 documents, maps, artifacts and artworks on
display at the Pierpont Morgan Library, at 29 E. 36th St. in
Manhattan, through Jan. 9 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of
Washington's death (Dec. 14, 1799).
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, ``The Great Experiment: George Washington and
the American Republic,'' offers, usually through Washington's own
hand, a complex view of the conflicted new leader and the
challenges that were confronting the nation as it stumbled into
existence 210 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dear sir,'' Washington writes James Madison on Aug. 5,
1789, enjoying an advantage that today's Supreme Court justices
might well envy in struggling with questions that Madison had not
contemplated in drafting the Constitution. The governing document
required the president to obtain the ``advise and consent of the
Senate'' in negotiating treaties, which Washington was then
attempting to do with the southern Creek Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would an Oral or written communication be best?'' Washington
inquires. ``If the first what mode is to be adopted to effect it?''
</P>
<P>
   In another letter two years later Washington, at this point
president, confesses to an aide what would today be considered an
early bit of executive bumbling: he had just discovered that his
Annual Message was due to Congress a week earlier than he had
presumed. ``I had no more idea of this than I had of its being
doomsday,'' Washington complained to his private secretary with
evident irritation.
</P>
<P>
   At times it is hard not to feel wistful while following the flow
of Washington's career through the letters presented at the Morgan.
How doubtful it is that another curator will be able to assemble a
similarly revealing exhibit about any contemporary president.
</P>
<P>
   The handwritten letter _ in all its self-edited glory, with
scribbled-out lines and inserted words and phrases _ has been lost
to the typewriter, the word processor and e-mail, to say nothing of
the the discouragement caused by special prosecutors and
congressional committees. And it is hard to imagine a modern-day
president (Jimmy Carter excepted) confessing self-doubt, or at
least putting such thoughts down in a letter. Here, in Washington's
hand, there is a stream of self-doubt, dark humility and candor
that, even if at times calculated, remains startling and
refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objective was to somehow correct this notion of Washington
as a mere figurehead or as a guy who looked good in a uniform,''
said John Rhodehamel, the curator of American history at the
Huntington Library in San Marino, Calif., which first presented the
exhibition. ``My sense of Washington is that he is vastly
underrated. He was without question the most successful statesman
in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting portrayal is of Washington as the ambitious yet
reluctant leader. He turns away from power at nearly every critical
moment in his career, starting from the end of his military
service. He did not want to be Virginia's delegate to the
Constitutional Convention, nor the nation's first president, and he
did not want to serve a second term. He was melancholy and, from
today's perspective, unduly pessimistic about how the experiment
that was the United States would turn out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Affairs, generally, seem really, to be approaching to some
awful crisis,'' he wrote Knox from the Constitutional Convention in
1787. ``God only knows what the result will be. It shall be my part
to hope for the best; as to see this Country happy whilst I am
gliding down the stream of life in tranquil retirement is so much
the wish of my Soul.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are letters in which Washington agonizes over his
ownership of slaves, including correspondence in which he considers
leasing Mount Vernon to, as he obliquely put it, ``liberate a
certain species of property which I possess, very repugnantly to my
own feelings.'' The slaves were not freed until the execution of
Washington's will, which can also be viewed as a published pamphlet
at the Morgan. At times Washington's sentiments seemed conflicted:
in another letter he advises a friend on ways to trick an escaped
slave back into service.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's correspondence here is unfailingly fascinating. A
letter from the battlefield finds Washington the general begging
for gunpowder to arm his troops. Later he turns to a neighbor for a
loan to pay for the trip to his inauguration. ``Never 'till within
these last two yrs I have experienced the want of money,'' he
wrote. ``Under this statement I am inclined to do what I have never
expected to be reduced to the necessity of doing _ that is, to
borrow money upon interest.'' Washington found himself in these
straits partly because he declined a salary while commanding the
Continental Army, though he did file an expense account. He claimed
$64,335.30 over eight and half years, including reimbursement for
his laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Often it is the medium itself _ the written letter _ that is the
most stirring aspect of this exhibition, starting with those
written by Washington, but also including some of his
contemporaries. Martha Washington wrote from her camp outside
Boston in the winter of 1775, ``Some days we have a number of
Cannon and shells from Boston and Bunkers Hill, but it does not
seem to surprise anyone but me; I confess I shudder every time I
hear the sound of a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   And John Adams, an aging man writing in a cramped hand, offers a
rather prickly judgment of Washington after his death. In words
that resonate today, Adams describes the first president as one of
the ``great masters of the theatrical exhibitions of politics.'' He
added, ``Washington understood this art very well, and we may say
of him if he was not the greatest President, he was the best actor
of Presidency we have ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is chronological, and toward the end of
Washington's second term familiar patterns of American political
discourse emerge, from the scorn of his foes _ ``As to you, sir,''
Thomas Paine wrote in a pamphlet, ``the world will be puzzled to
decide, whether you have abandoned good principles, or whether you
ever had any'' _ to the gloom and bitterness of a leader
contemplating the twilight of his years in public service.
</P>
<P>
   Just two days before he stepped down from power in 1797,
Washington wrote Knox complaining about enemies who sought ``to
misrepresent my motives; to reprobate my politics; and to weaken
the confidence that has been reposed in my administration.'' All
that was missing was a depiction of the departing president taking
a few mulligans as he played a round of golf alone at dusk one
lonely weekend afternoon.

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As I walked to work this morning, a man stood on a street corner
shouting, ``Do you know Jesus? Repent! Repent or suffer eternal
torments in Hell!''
 &HT;    Since I live in Memphis, I figured this brother to be a
Pentecostal or a Southern Baptist.
 &HT;    Whatever the case, I knew that I -- as an Episcopalian -- was
fresh evangelistic meat, so I crossed the street.
 &HT;    Never enter into a discussion with street-corner evangelists. I
have told them they give Christians a bad name and pleaded with
them to preach God's love. They don't listen. Even if you are a
Christian, they refuse to believe you unless you are their
particular kind of Christian. Talking is not an option.
 &HT;    On Nov. 28, the Council of Religious Leaders of Metropolitan
Chicago, representing the city's Roman Catholic Archdiocese and
thirty-nine other Christian and Jewish organizations, criticized a
Southern Baptist evangelistic plan to target their city with
100,000 missionaries next summer.
 &HT;    While the Council recognized the rights of Southern Baptists to
engage in evangelism, they questioned the wisdom of such an effort,
saying, ``a campaign of the nature and scope you envision could
contribute to a climate conducive to hate crimes.'' Citing concern
for Jews, Muslims and Hindus, they urged Baptist leaders to ``enter
into discussion with us and reconsider your plans.''
 &HT;    R. Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Seminary in
Louisville, responded: ``To link New Testament evangelism with hate
crimes is cowardice posing as compassion. Fortunately, Southern
Baptists do not receive orders from Chicago's Council of Religious
Leaders, but from the New Testament and the words of our Lord Jesus
Christ.''
 &HT;    What those folks up north don't know is that their (implicit)
accusation -- Southern Baptists are narrow-minded bigots -- are
fightin' words. Chicago's council may desire consensus and
cooperation, but they only fuelled the Southern Baptist fire to
evangelize those spiritually blind northerners.
 &HT;    Talking to a bunch of liberal religious leaders is not part of
God's plan -- except, perhaps, to convert them.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, the Chicago debacle prefigures that which is to
come in cities across the nation. Earlier this year, Southern
Baptists launched the ``Strategic Focus Cities'' initiative to
evangelize major metropolitan areas. Ostensibly, they just want to
``share'' Jesus. In reality, however, the Southern Baptist
Convention (SBC) wants to extend its influence to other parts of
the country by starting 60,000 new churches -- mostly in the North
and West -- by 2020.
 &HT;    Until recently, the 15-million-member SBC has been a regional
denomination. Not widely known elsewhere, it is a social, cultural
and political powerhouse in the South, where it serves as a
quasi-official religious establishment.
 &HT;    Here in Memphis, non-Southern Baptists refer to Adrian Rogers,
pastor of the city's largest Southern Baptist church, as ``Pope
Adrian,'' a moniker befitting his influence.
 &HT;    In their home region, Southern Baptists need not listen to
anyone. They do as they please. Over the last two decades, they
purged their denomination, insisting on strict theological and
moral conformity.
 &HT;    The current leaders, self-proclaimed ``Fundamentalists,'' do not
negotiate. As dissenting Southern Baptists know, they only dictate
terms of surrender. They are not used to talking to -- or invited
to discussions with -- other Protestants, Roman Catholics, Jews,
northerners, apostates and nonbelievers.
 &HT;    With any luck, as Southern Baptists attempt to become a
``national'' church, they will become less rigid and willing to
cooperate with other people of faith to promote the spiritual
welfare of all. The Chicago confrontation will not be the last.
Other groups of religious leaders, who have toiled to make their
communities better places, will insist that Southern Baptists come
to a common faith table.
 &HT;    Those of us who have lived in the North and West understand the
delicate complexity of religious pluralism, and the potential that
fundamentalist religion possesses for creating (even unintended)
violence. The narrow bigotry of the current Southern Baptist
leadership won't (I hope and pray) play in Peoria or Chicago or
Boston.
 &HT;    They are free to shout from street corners or send 100,000
missionaries to an already spiritually vital city. The Council of
Religious Leaders in Chicago has graciously asked them to slow down
their evangelistic assault -- inviting them instead to discuss
religious diversity and pluralism.
 &HT;    I wonder as I listen to this regional religious cross talk: What
would Jesus do? But having observed the SBC over the last decade, I
suspect the campaign will go on as scheduled. If I were those
Chicago leaders, I'd have just crossed to the other side of the
street.

 &HT;    CLINTON TO PUSH FOR MORE OPEN MARKETS AT WORLD TRADE CONFERENCE
 &HT;    (450&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With WTO-PROTESTS-1201.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Eying trillions of dollars in potential U.S. exports
over the coming decade, President Clinton is making a major push to
widen overseas markets for American companies in new global trade
talks opening here this week.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies marketing services _ from telecommunications and
finance to parcel delivery and computer systems design _ took in a
record $246 billion from overseas sales last year. That's a 42-fold
increase over 1960 levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration foresees even greater potential for
increases, though, as the global marketplace becomes more tightly
knitted together and the competitive and strategic advantages of
U.S. companies in the service fields continue to widen.
</P>
<P>
   Services now account for 70 percent of U.S. economic output,
which totalled $8.5 trillion last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet, the market access globally is not nearly what it
should be,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told
White House reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
   As trade ministers from 135 countries gather here to kick-off a
new round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations expected
to last three years, Barshefsky aims to widen U.S. access to
foreign markets, particularly in services areas.
</P>
<P>
   In telecommunications, for example, only 74 of the WTO member
countries have signed on to a 1998 global telecom agreement _ aimed
at ending monopoly control over the burgeoning telecommunications
business. Adopting new WTO rules that mirror that agreement could
open huge new market opportunities for U.S. telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two years, Barshefsky said, global
telecommunications capacity could increase a stunning 50-fold,
owing to market access agreements already reached and undersea
cable projects in the works.
</P>
<P>
   She's also pushing for U.S. financial services companies and for
the information technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few areas where the potential rewards for the United
States are as great as they are in services,'' Barshefsky told the
Senate Banking Committee in November. ``Our services industries,
ranging from finance to telecom, distribution, health care . . .
and so on, provide 86 million jobs in the United States and over
$5.5 trillion (a year) worth of production.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first round of global trade talks of the Internet
age, and Clinton is pressing to extend tax-free status for
so-called e-commerce, where U.S. companies ranging from Amazon.com
to Landsend.com have built a $20-billion-a-year industry from
on-line shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Internet sales have grown faster than regulators' understanding
of the medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``With respect to e-commerce,'' said Barshefsky, ``is it a good,
is it a service? I can tell you now trade ministers don't have a
clue.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Stakes are high, also, for U.S. farmers and ranchers. U.S.
agricultural exports, which the administration claims support
750,000 American jobs, slid to $52 billion last year _ down from
$60.6 billion two years before _ owing largely to economic troubles
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes this WTO round will strike down massive subsidies
and other supports provided to farmers chiefly in Europe, Japan,
South Korea, Norway and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   European governments spend $7 billion a year _ 85 percent of the
world's agricultural subsidies _ to prop up farmers that can't
compete with their counterparts in the United States and elsewhere
around the world, according to White House figures.
</P>
<P>
   To fight those subsidies, the United States has lined up a
strong coalition of countries _ largely poorer nations in Asia,
Africa and Latin America _ that would like to boost exports to
Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Barshefsky said, the United States is fighting an uphill
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agriculture will be very, very difficult in general,'' she
told the Senate committee, ``as it has been for 30 years.''

   &QL; 
AIRLINES COMBAT CARRY-ON CRUNCH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that most carriers have placed new limits on
carry-on luggage, and passengers aboard a recent flight from
Redding, Calif., to San Francisco likely applaud those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Stienstra reports in the San Francisco Examiner:
</P>
<P>
   ``The passengers were just settling in when suddenly, on
climb-out, this red, foul-smelling juice started flowing out of the
overhead baggage compartment and onto the passengers below.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several passengers shouted, one screamed, and all tried to
shield themselves from the pervasive red juice. It was sticky, foul
and just kept coming, dripping on the passengers despite their best
efforts to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the plane angled for higher altitudes,'' Stienstra
continued, ``the juice seemed to move to the rear of the plane, as
if alive in the baggage compartment. Meanwhile, one passenger,
Larry Ivancitch, just smiled nervously.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the plane leveled off, the juice stopped, and a flight
attendant opened the overhead bin _ and a wet, slippery 30-pound
salmon fell out, right into the lap of one of the horrified
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that Ivancitch had caught the fish earlier that
day from the Sacramento River, then stowed the fish in an overhead
bin as carry-on baggage.''
</P>
<P>
   The real ``fish tale'' may have come when security guards
attempted to explain how this ``parcel'' got through the carry-on
inspection station.

MILLENNIUM CELEBRATION A DUD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to the 16,000 employees at 35 Ritz-Carlton
hotels and resorts around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Among items on order for the big event:
</P>
<P>
   _ 40,680 bottles of champagne
</P>
<P>
   _ 8,370 sets of Bulgari bath amenities
</P>

<P>
   _ 45 chefs at the Ritz-Carlton on Amelia Island, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two tons of gingerbread to form replicas of London's Big Ben,
Paris' Eiffel Tower and New York's Times Square in the lobby of the
Ritz-Carlton Tysons Corner in McLean, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but what about the ``biggest-ever'' morning after?
</P>
<P>
   The Ritz-Carlton in Hong Kong plans to open a Hangover Hospital
where guests can choose their remedy: Bloody Marys or Alka-Seltzer.
</P>
<P>
   Guests at the chain's property in Seoul can partake of a
home-grown hangover antidote: haejanggook, a hot and spicy soup
available at all restaurants and from room service.
</P>
<P>
   The Portman Ritz-Carlton in Shanghai is taking no chances. It's
stocking up on familiar headache medications and on Barocca
``hangover helper'' vitamin drink. Guests may also avail themselves
of wu liang ye, a 3,000-year-old ``hair of the dog'' Chinese herbal
remedy. Brewed with Chinese sorghum, husked rice, glutinous rice,
wheat and maize, it is fermented for 70 days, producing a mellow,
fragrant concoction often called ``wine from heaven.''

MEXICO CITY FIGHTS BACK AGAINST CRIME &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City's government merits praise for several measures
taken recently to address health and safety concerns expressed by
travelers. These include stricter controls of taxis, anti-pollution
regulations and the establishment of tourism-information kiosks
staffed with English-speaking personnel.
</P>
<P>
   In another new strategy, 950 female officers have been added to
the city's predominantly male police force. They've been stationed
at 30 of the city's busiest intersections. According to the Mexico
City Tourism Authority, they are the only officers now allowed to
write tickets for traffic violations.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning: The government says it believes women are
stricter than men.

ADVENTURE TRAVEL SPANS THE GLOBE &QL;

</P>
<P>
   I'm inundated with tour brochures about biking, hiking, birding,
sea kayaking, mountain climbing, in-line skating and every other
kind of active pursuit. But former Houstonian Craig Nelson takes
adventure travel to new extremes in his new book, ``Let's Get
Lost'' (Warner Books, $24).
</P>
<P>
   Nelson writes: ``I've been threatened by an orangutan in Borneo
... taught dance steps to cannibals in New Guinea ... taken
psychoactive pharmaceuticals with a Jivaro shaman in the middle of
the Amazon ... sailed the South Pacific in an 18th-century
brigantine ... and stalked gorillas in Uganda.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll leave you with just a hint of the fun here: In the African
bush, Nelson writes, ``The tribe offered me a lunch of baboon and
(traveling companion) Brenda some fresh impala, but in an amazing
coincidence, we'd just eaten and had to pass.''

SOCIAL SECURITY CHANGES LIKELY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SHANNON BUGGS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a decade, the generation of children attending elementary
school now will begin entering the work force. Their taxed wages
will pay for the Social Security benefits you and I will collect
when we retire.
</P>
<P>
   That is until 2034.
</P>
<P>
   Government analysts have determined that in that year, if Social
Security continues to operate as it does, the system would only be
able to cover about 71 percent of all the funds needed to provide
full retirement, disability and survivor benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is abuzz with talk about reforming the system and
lessening the nation's dependency on it.
</P>
<P>
   Laissez-faire politicians want the system dismantled and
replaced with individually managed retirement accounts for every
American.
</P>
<P>
   The president, meanwhile, has suggested buying back old U.S.
Treasury bonds to reduce the nation's debt and use the money saved
to fund future Social Security payments.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear if either proposal will work, but two outcomes
seem certain: Social Security will be re-engineered in the near
future and the uncertainty surrounding it means retirees must
depend on other sources of sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the latter, the Social Security Administration
began mailing last month a benefits statement to every worker age
25 or older not already receiving benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The four-page document estimates the monthly amount you would
get when you retire or become disabled if you didn't work another
day past the statement date. It also shows what your spouse and
dependent children would get if you died on that day.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CREDITS AND LIMITS AND CAPS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eligibility for Social Security retirement benefits is
determined by a credit system based on income and years of
employment.
</P>
<P>
   For example, this year you earn one credit for every $740 in
wages, up to four credits each year. Most people must have 40
credits to qualify for retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   That means the typical worker has to be in the work force at
least 10 years and earning a minimum yearly salary of $3,000 to
collect a check.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of your benefit depends on how much money you earned
during a lifetime of work. However, since there is a limit on how
much of your income is subject to Social Security taxes &UR;  &LR; _ $72,600
this year _ there is also a cap on how much you can get in
benefits. This year the maximum monthly payment is &UR;  &LR; $1,373 for a
person who retires at age 65.
</P>
<P>
   This is the last year that full retirement benefits can be
collected as soon as a person turns age 65. Over the next 27 years,
the age requirement will gradually increase to 67.
</P>
<P>
   Since medical advances continue to lengthen lives and America's
largest generation is on the cusp of retirement, the Social
Security Administration asked Congress for some breathing room
before it had to help support our graying society.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit statements that are being mailed to about 125
million Americans have long been available to workers who requested
them. But a new law requires the government to send unsolicited
statements of potential benefits to the nation's workers each year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GET A PLAN AND START SAVING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mass mailing costs about $70 million this year, but that may
prove to be a bargain if it gets more people to start seriously
thinking about planning and saving for their retirements.
</P>
<P>
   A person born in 1960 with an estimated future annual income of
$68,400 can expect a Social Security check of $1,580 per month when
she retires at age 67. The amount falls to $1,105 a month if she
retires early at age 62.
</P>
<P>
   A common retirement rule of thumb is 70 percent of current
income is needed to maintain the same lifestyle in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   So, this 39-year-old person would need a monthly income of
$3,990. Social Security provides 40 percent of that, which is about
average for most U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   But with the future of the Social Security Trust uncertain,
financial planners advise workers to prepare for Social Security to
account for only about 20 percent of their retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   That means paying off credit cards, maxing out your 401(k) and
putting aside 15 percent of your net income each month for
investments, if you are age 39 or older and haven't begun to plan
for retirement, says Gary Ferguson, head of the Houston office of
AXA Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security will not be enough to take care of you in your
golden years. And the statements coming in the mail show it was
never designed to do so.

   CARMEL, Calif. _ Beverly Cleary sometimes forgets that she is a
world-famous writer. Or she simply refuses to believe it. Even
after 50 years of fan mail and book signings and awards, attention
unsettles her, especially when it comes in concentrated doses as it
has since the release of her latest children's book, her 38th.
</P>
<P>
   For this interview, she is sitting on a well-stuffed sofa in her
living room with her back straight as a board and her hands folded
in her lap. She prefers phone interviews. Better still is when she
can satisfy the press with an eight-minute video about her book,
``Beverly Cleary Talks About `Ramona's World,''' produced by her
publisher, Morrow Junior Books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wonder why all the fuss?'' Ms. Cleary says, brushing
invisible lint off a maroon jumper. Her hair is a soft gray, her
cheeks, at the moment, the pink of her oxford shirt. ``Maybe,'' she
says, after a pause, ``it's because it's my first Ramona book in 15
years.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, her husband, Clarence Cleary, who has been sitting
quietly to her right in an armchair, leans his wiry frame forward,
as if to reveal a great secret. They have been married 59 years. He
does have stories. ``If I tell you,'' he says, ``some of the honors
Beverly has received in the last few years . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clarence!'' the voice is an alarm. ``Don't you dare!''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, had she not written ``Ramona's World'' (released in
August and working its way up children's best-seller lists ) Ms.
Cleary would still generate lines at book signings. Her characters
_ from Henry Huggins and Ribsy to Beezus and Ramona to Ralph S.
Mouse and Socks the Cat _ would remain embedded in the memory of
millions of children speaking 14 languages in 20 countries. Her
name is one of the first recognized as a writer once they realize
that books are written and not produced out of thin air.
</P>
<P>
   So when at age 83 she becomes 9, with a 9-year-old's hopes
(``The fourth grade was going to be the best year of her life, so
far'') and a 9-year-old's concerns (``The fourth grade suddenly
began to stretch ahead, long and dreary and full of spelling''),
people want to know how and why she did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' she says with a giggle. ``Ramona just wouldn't let me
alone. I would go about my daily business, and she kept intruding.
Finally she just insisted. She said, `Come on, sit down and write
the book.' So I did.''
</P>
<P>
   So every morning after breakfast, she sat down with a pen and
yellow legal pad, as if Ramona were giving dictation. When she was
done, she typed up the manuscript on an old electric typewriter in
the corner off her bedroom. She does not use a computer, but has
her manuscripts retyped by a professional before being sent to her
publisher. She has never had an agent.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing earth shattering happens in ``Ramona's World.'' No
magical Harry Potter adventures. No taken-from-the-headlines social
problems. No great moral lessons. Ramona's world is Klickitat
Street in Portland, Ore., near the street where the author grew up.
She insists that the neighborhood is much the same.
</P>
<P>
   Once a week she speaks to an old friend who still lives there,
she says, and life there remains cozy. It is a world of ordinary
beauty, where children play rough and tumble outside and compare
battle wounds. (``Ramona's calluses were hard and yellow, because
she lived close to the park.'') They don't dodge drug dealers. They
don't have nannies.
</P>
<P>
   Such a world is exciting enough for a precocious 9-year-old with
a wild imagination. Ramona, who was 5 when she starred in her first
book, ``Ramona the Pest,'' now has a baby sister, Roberta, a best
friend, Daisy, and a boy she likes, Daniel, nicknamed Yard Ape for
his playground prowess. Beezus, her big sister, is entering high
school. And the ever-curious Ramona (``the sort of girl who was
always early because something might happen that she didn't want to
miss'') experiences the best moment in a 9-year-old's life: turning
10.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if Ms. Cleary, who sees much of herself in Ramona the
dreamer, has never forgotten what is important in life at 9. ``I'm
very fortunate in that I do have a very good memory of my
childhood,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote her first novel, ``Henry Huggins,'' in 1950. She was
33, a children's librarian in Yakima, Wash., and a boy complained
that he could not find any books he could relate to. This inspired
the story of a boy from Klickitat Street who finds a stray dog and
takes him home on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning her writing was crisp and clean. Her first
book begins: ``Henry Huggins was in the third grade. His hair
looked like a scrubbing brush and most of his grown-up front teeth
were in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only way I know how to write,'' she says, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Atlee Bunn met Clarence Cleary when they were students
at the University of California at Berkeley. They eloped in 1940.
She was Protestant, he Catholic, and her parents disapproved. The
couple settled in California, following his career as an
accountant. She says she always knew she wanted to write _
children's books especially _ but didn't start until both she and
her husband were well established in their careers. After having
twins, a boy and a girl, in 1955, she became more prolific, using
her children's lives to write about experiences she had never had,
like going to kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   The prizes she has won include the American Library Association
Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, for lasting contribution to children's
literature, and a 1984 John Newbery Medal for ``Dear Mr. Henshaw,''
the story of a 10-year-old boy's correspondence with his favorite
author while his parents divorce. She has won two Newbery Honor
awards, for ``Ramona and her Father'' and ``Ramona Quimby, Age 8,''
and dozens of statewide awards based on readers' choices.
</P>
<P>
   One of her husband's favorite tributes to her is the Beverly
Cleary sculpture garden at Grant Park in northeast Portland, with
bronze statutes of Henry Huggins, Ribsy, Ramona and Beezus based on
the classic illustrations of the books by Louis Darling. There is
also the Beverly Cleary residence hall at the Berkeley campus.
</P>
<P>
   She will not talk about all the mail she gets, about 100 letters
a day, her publisher said. And the letter she has tacked up on the
wall behind her desk is hardly a fan letter. Written by a boy in
awkward cursive, it is a hello from an old friend of hers who is
dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``P.S. This is all a lie,'' the letter says.
</P>
<P>
   She says she does not remember when she got the letter. ``It
should have a date on it,'' she says. ``They should teach that in
school.''
</P>
<P>
   But when she looks at the letter, she laughs and utters what
Beverly Cleary readers know is a high compliment. ``That kid,'' she
says, ``has some imagination.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a time when Mediterranean accents seem to dominate
many American menus, a little German is creeping in. Spaetzle, the
tiny dumplings of Eastern Europe, are turning up where couscous
once did, alongside duck, venison and fish.
</P>
<P>
   These close cousins to gnocchi and fresh pasta look like little
squiggles of dough, but taste like buttery air. (Think Mozart, not
Wagner.)
</P>
<P>
   Spaetzle are everywhere lately, from Quilty's in SoHo to Artie's
New York Delicatessen and Picholine on the Upper West Side, from
Italian restaurants like Felidia and Circo to Frenchified Japanese
places like Sono, all in Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   Part of their wide appeal is their chameleon quality. Spaetzle
can be plain or be made with chestnut or buckwheat flour; they can
be seasoned with only salt and pepper or turned almost green with
fresh herbs like chives or sage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a million and one ways to do spaetzle _ and that's
without getting too crazy with them,'' said Eberhard Mueller of
Lutece, who is from the cradle of spaetzle, Swabia, the Black
Forest region of southern Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Spaetzle (usually pronounced SHPEH-tzl in English) take no
special skills to make, and in fact look best when they are rather
haphazard, almost misshapen. So they are that rare restaurant trend
that works for home kitchens. The basic ingredients for the thick
batter are flour and eggs. Although there are special German and
Austrian spaetzle gadgets, cutting board and knife, or just press
the dough through a colander can be used. The little dumplings are
dropped into boiling water until they firm up and float and are
often tossed in butter afterward. But they can be varied at will.
</P>
<P>
   ``As American cooks, we're exploring the last European
frontier,'' said Katy Sparks, the chef at Quilty's, who serves
black pepper and herb flecked spaetzle to complement squab in
Madeira sauce. ``First came the Mediterranean, but it's time we
recognized Eastern Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sparks said she knew spaetzle from visits to Vienna and
other parts of Eastern Europe with her father, M. Kimberley Sparks,
who is professor emeritus of German at Middlebury College in
Vermont. ``It was easy for me to make a gesture to the region with
something delicious I'd been exposed to in the past,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other chefs, like Mueller and Mario Lohninger of Danube, are
even more familiar with spaetzle from their childhoods. Lohninger,
the chef de cuisine at Danube, David Bouley's homage to Austria in
TriBeCa, is the son of restaurateurs in Salzburg who sometimes
served spaetzle tossed with cheese as a main course, or in soup. At
Danube he adds pureed garlic chives to the thick batter, giving the
spaetzle a sharp flavor and a verdant tint.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, who is now using spaetzle as an accompaniment to
venison and red cabbage, recalled how they were typically served at
Sunday lunch in Germany with braised beef, veal or pork as well as
German potato salad and lettuce dressed with lemon juice. ``And my
mother would put parsley and chives in her spaetzle long before it
was fashionable,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Lidia Bastianich, the owner of Felidia, said she often ate
spaetzle back in Friuli, the region in northeastern Italy that
abuts Austria. ``We make spaetzle to go with braised dishes and we
season it with saffron, tomato or spinach, like gnocchi,'' she
said. (But she added, ``I just came back from Italy, and I was
served spaetzle in Piedmont. I have no idea where they got it
from.'')
</P>
<P>
   Even chefs with no spaetzle in their pasts are experimenting:
Terrance Brennan at Picholine makes them with chestnut flour; Chris
Metz at Artie's New York Delicatessen works kasha into the dough;
John Reese at Adrienne flavors spaetzle with saffron; and John
McGrath at C3 adds sage. Tadashi Ono at Sono makes his with
buckwheat flour, giving them the flavor of Japanese soba noodles.
Outside New York, spaetzle are being seasoned with Dijon mustard at
Spruce in Chicago and with curry at Charles Nob Hill in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Cuisines of Germany'' (Poseidon Press, 1980), Horst
Scharfenberg called spaetzle the ``quintessential Swabian
delicacy.'' Some trace the name to fat-bodied little sparrows, or
spatzen in South German dialect. But Scharfenberg favored the
derivation from the Italian spezzare, meaning to cut in pieces. He
wrote that spaetzle are thought to have been brought to Germany by
Italian workers or monks in the Middle Ages. But he also suggested
that they might have arrived earlier with Roman soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Because spaetzle require no rolling or cutting, they may be the
simplest, least technically demanding pasta to make. The process is
just tedious. There are special spaetzle-makers: wood boards with
sharp edges over which the batter is scraped with a knife (there is
even such a thing as a spaetzle knife), or perforated metal gadgets
that fit over the pots and have sliding hoppers to push the dough
through.
</P>
<P>
   But most chefs make spaetzle simply by forcing the thick batter
through the holes of a colander or a hotel pan (a kind of
perforated saucepan used for warming or steaming). A large
stainless-steel colander with holes one-eighth inch to one-quarter
inch wide can be used. Hold it over a pot that is half filled with
boiling water and use a large spoon, a wooden spatula or a dough
scraper to push the batter through the holes.
</P>
<P>
   That is the method of choice of the cashier at Schaller &AMP; Weber,
the German food store on the Upper East Side, where I bought
packaged spaetzle for comparison purposes. When I asked which of
four brands to choose, she responded: ``You don't have to buy it.
You make a simple batter with eggs and flour and press it through a
colander.'' (I now understand the universal disdain for the
packaged spaetzle, which are more like twisted bits of egg noodle
and not as feathery as the homemade kind.)
</P>
<P>
   Mueller scoffs: ``The colander is not the authentic way in
Germany. That's considered the fast food version.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he scrapes the bits of dough off a board and into
boiling water with a knife, in a rapid-fire motion he learned from
his mother. ``Where I grew up, there was a saying that if a woman
couldn't make spaetzle by hand she was not worth marrying,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   I found a cutting board easier to use than a colander, and the
yield was slightly greater, since there was no waste. With a
colander, some batter will cling.
</P>
<P>
   Balance the small wooden cutting board, preferably one with a
handle, on the edge of the pot and use a table knife to scrape tiny
bits of batter off and flick them into the pot. Dip the knife blade
frequently into cold water to help the batter slip off.
</P>
<P>
   When the dough is pushed through a colander, a hotel pan or a
perforated metal spaetzle maker, the pieces tend to be plumper and
shorter. Scraped off a board, they are like little strips or
squiggles. The thicker the batter, the shorter the pieces tend to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs like spaetzle because they do not have to be served at
once _ a boon to the home cook as well. They can be reheated later
by lightly toasting them in a skillet with butter. A good,
traditional finishing touch is to let the butter turn hazelnut
color, stir in bread crumbs and let them brown before adding the
spaetzle and a dusting of minced herbs.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, liver puree is sometimes mixed into the batter. It's
a variation New Yorkers might like _ but with foie gras, of course.

`BEYOND THE CLOUDS': THREE VIGNETTES AFLOAT IN ROMANTIC
OBSESSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: The precede may be italicized)  
 (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Beyond the Clouds'' was shown as part of the 1996 New York
Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Stephen Holden's review,
which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 28, 1996. The film
opens Wednesday in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments of such astounding visual power in
Michelangelo Antonioni's film ``Beyond the Clouds'' that you are
all but transported through the screen to a place where the
physical and emotional weather fuse into a palpable sadness.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene the brooding, peripatetic director who introduces
the movie's vignettes (played by John Malkovich), finds himself in
Portofino, where he becomes obsessed with a beautiful woman he sees
in a shop. As he lingers on the beach under an ominous sky, a stiff
wind churns the sand into a diaphanous river.
</P>
<P>
   With the ground literally moving under his feet, and the sea and
sky threatening, he becomes an eerily isolated figure, seemingly
floating just above the earth in a melancholy reverie.
</P>
<P>
   If this scene recalls similar moments in Antonioni's 1959
masterpiece, ``L'Avventura,'' in which a group of friends combs the
rocks of an abandoned island in search of a woman who has
mysteriously vanished, the allusion seems deliberate. For ``Beyond
the Clouds,'' this Italian filmmaker's first movie since 1982, has
the feel of an eloquent, quirky swan song that recycles for one
last time themes that have run through all of his films.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago Antonioni, who is now 83, had a stroke that
left him severely incapacitated. ``Beyond the Clouds'' was
completed with help from Wim Wenders, who wrote its prologue and
epilogue and worked on the screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who will be impatient with this film, which was
adapted from short stories in Antonioni's book ``The Bowling Alley
on the Tiber.'' The dialogue is sparse, and what there is often
sounds stiff and pretentious. Malkovich, playing Antonioni's
stand-in, makes blunt, oracular pronouncements about desire, art
and the pursuit of reality that ring sophomoric or prophetic,
depending on your feelings about Antonioni.
</P>
<P>
   These vignettes portray characters caught up in romantic
obsessions presented as metaphors for the artist's pursuit of an
elusive truth. In the opening vignette two beautiful young lovers
(Kim Rossi-Stuart and Ines Sastre), filmed with a cool, soft-core
elegance, never consummate their passion because the young man
prefers to imagine a perfection that reality could never match.
</P>
<P>
   The second pas de deux finds Malkovich's character in Portofino
stalking the woman inside the shop. She enigmatically informs him
that she murdered her father.
</P>
<P>
   From Italy we move to Paris for the third and most conventional
story, a romantic triangle in which an ardent philanderer (Peter
Weller) tries to appease the demands of his wife (Fanny Ardant) and
mistress (Chiara Caselli).
</P>
<P>
   In the final story Vincent Perez plays a young man who trails a
woman (Irene Jacob) to church and falls more deeply in love with
her the more inaccessible she makes herself. By the time she tells
him that she will enter a convent the next day, he is besotted.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of these stories is not in the words but in the way
the mood, texture and the acting build each situation into a
visually intense parable about the similarity of spiritual, erotic
and aesthetic aspiration.

How to light up your Hanukkah celebration 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Recipes) 
By Natalie Haughton 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News

</P>
<P>
   RICOTTA LATKES
</P>
<P>
   Both cheese and latkes are very traditional foods for Hanukkah.
The following latkes are much more delicate and refined than the
potato type and make a tasty breakfast or even a nice dessert,
especially when topped with a good jam or fresh fruit.
</P>
<P>
   BATTER: &QL; 
1 (15- to 16-ounce) container part-skim ricotta cheese &QL; 
4 large eggs OR 1 cup egg substitute &QL; 
2 tablespoons sugar &QL; 
1/2 to 1 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
2 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled &QL; 
1/2 cup all-purpose flour &QL; 
FOR FRYING: &QL; 
Butter OR margarine OR canola oil &QL; 
FOR SERVING: &QL; 
Jam, applesauce, plain OR vanilla yogurt, AND/OR chopped fresh
fruit
</P>
<P>
   For Batter, in a food processor fitted with a steel blade (or in
a blender in batches if necessary), combine ricotta cheese, eggs,
sugar and vanilla. Process until well mixed. Add melted butter and
process briefly. Add flour, and process until batter is very
smooth, like thick cream. Scrape down sides of container a few
times during processing. Batter will be thinner than most pancake
batters.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat a griddle or shallow skillet, preferably nonstick, over
medium heat (not hotter). An electric skillet set at 325 degrees F
also works well. Lightly grease griddle with butter. (You can use a
stick of cold butter to make 3-inch circles on griddle.)
</P>
<P>
   For each latke, spoon a 1 1/2- to 2-tablespoon measure of batter
(no more) onto greased preheated griddle. Batter will spread to
form an approximately 3-inch-diameter latke. Keep latkes at least
1/2-inch apart.
</P>
<P>
   Cook about 3 minutes or until a few bubbles have risen to
surface of pancakes, tops are beginning to look dry and bottoms are
golden brown in a sort of splotchy pattern. Latkes will not rise at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully use a pancake turner to turn latkes once. (If bottoms
of latkes brown before tops are dry enough to turn, heat is too
high.) Cook latkes briefly on second side just until golden brown.
Repeat until all batter is used, greasing griddle between batches.
</P>
<P>
   Serve pancakes warm or at room temperature, with your choice of
accompaniments. Latkes can be reheated in a microwave oven or kept
warm for a short time in preheated 200- to 250-degree F
conventional oven. Makes about 24 to 30 (2 1/2- to 3-inch-diameter)
latkes.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: It's recommended that these latkes be prepared on a
nonstick griddle, which requires very little grease. Gloria Greene
prefers to cook latkes in butter because this adds to their flavor.
The small amount of butter in batter also improves taste of latkes.
</P>
<P>
   NO-FAT RICOTTA LATKES: Although the original recipe above is
preferred, the following changes will work for those on restricted
diets. Use nonfat ricotta cheese and egg substitute. Omit melted
butter in batter. Use 1 teaspoon vanilla. When cooking latkes, use
a nonstick griddle that has been coated with nonstick cooking spray
before preheating. Make sure that heat is not too high.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHILI CON QUESO
</P>
<P>
   1 pound shredded regular Cheddar, longhorn OR Monterey Jack
cheese (see Note) &QL; 
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour &QL; 
2 tablespoons olive OR canola oil &QL; 
1 large onion, finely chopped &QL; 
2 garlic cloves, minced &QL; 
1 (14- to 16-ounce) can tomatoes, including juice, finely chopped &QL; 
1 (4-ounce) can diced green chiles &QL; 
1/4 cup chopped ripe olives (optional) &QL; 
Corn chips, nacho chips OR broken taco pieces for dipping
</P>
<P>
   Toss cheese with flour and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Put oil into a large saucepan over medium-high heat; then saute
onion and garlic until very tender. Add tomatoes with their juice
and chiles. Heat, while stirring, until sauce gently boils.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually add shredded cheese, stirring constantly. Continue to
stir over medium to medium-high heat 5 to 10 minutes or until
cheese is completely melted and smooth and mixture just comes to a
boil. Stir in olives.
</P>
<P>
   Remove mixture from heat and cool, stirring occasionally, about
5 minutes, so it can thicken slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Serve warm chili con queso in a chafing dish, fondue pot or deep
bowl with your choice of accompaniments for dipping. Makes about 4
1/2 cups dip.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Reduced-fat cheese may not melt properly in this recipe.
Do not use nonfat cheese.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   QUICK-AND-EASY CHEESE BLINTZ CASSEROLE
</P>
<P>
   BATTER: &QL; 
4 large eggs (no substitutes) &QL; 
1 1/4 cups milk &QL; 
2 tablespoons dairy sour cream &QL; 
1/4 cup butter, melted (for best flavor, no substitutes) &QL; 
3/4 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour &QL; 
1 to 2 tablespoons sugar &QL; 
1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder &QL; 
FILLING: &QL; 
2 (7 1/2- to 8-ounce) packages curd-style farmer cheese &QL; 
1 (15- to 16-ouncee) container ricotta cheese, any type &QL; 
2 large eggs OR 1/2 cup egg substitute &QL; 
2 to 3 tablespoons sugar &QL; 
2 tablespoons lemon juice &QL; 
FOR SERVING: &QL; 
Dairy sour cream &QL; 
Plain OR vanilla yogurt &QL; 
Applesauce &QL; 
Sliced fresh strawberries OR other fruit
</P>
<P>
   Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish or coat with nonstick cooking
spray.
</P>
<P>
   For Batter, in a blender or food processor (fitted with a steel
blade), combine all Batter ingredients. Process until very smooth,
scraping down sides of container once or twice. Measure out 1 1/2
cups batter and pour into bottom of prepared baking dish. Bake in
preheated 350-degree oven about 10 minutes or until set.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, combine all filling ingredients in a large bowl and
mix well. When bottom layer has set, remove from oven and spread
filling over it, smoothing top. Give remaining batter a brief stir
to mix ingredients; then very slowly pour over cheese filling so
filling is completely covered.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully return casserole to 350-degree F oven. Bake an
additional 35 to 40 minutes or until top is puffed and set. Let
casserole stand about 10 minutes before cutting into squares.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with your choice of accompaniments. Makes about 8 servings
as a main course, more as a side dish or buffet dish.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: The types of cheeses in the filling were determined after
much experimentation with various mixtures. It is the best
combination to produce the desired results of separate layers.
</P>
<P>
   The top of this casserole is rather plain. If desired, sprinkle
lightly with ground cinnamon or cinnamon-sugar before casserole is
returned to oven for final baking.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ISRAELI SALAD
</P>
<P>
   This recipe is meant only to be a guide; vary ingredient
proportions to taste. For the best flavor, prepare the salad just
before serving.
</P>
<P>
   3 large tomatoes, ripened, diced &QL; 
2 to 3 medium cucumbers, peeled (if desired) and diced &QL; 
4 green onions, including green tops, thinly sliced OR 1 small
onion, peeled and finely diced &QL; 
1 to 2 medium green OR red bell peppers, diced &QL; 
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley &QL; 
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice OR to taste &QL; 
3 tablespoons olive oil &QL; 
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Combine tomatoes, cucumbers, green onions, peppers and parsley
into a large serving bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, mix together lemon juice and oil. Pour over
vegetables and toss well. Season salad to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Serve immediately, as a side dish or in a pita loaf as an
accompaniment to falafel. Makes about 6 to 8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FRUIT-NUT CONFECTION BALLS
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1/2 cup dried apricots &QL; 
1/2 cup pitted dates &QL; 
1/2 cup dried figs &QL; 
1/2 cup pitted prunes &QL; 
1/2 cup walnut pieces &QL; 
1/4 cup shredded coconut (optional) &QL; 
2 tablespoons honey OR as needed &QL; 
Granulated sugar (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Finely chop apricots, dates, figs, prunes and walnuts in a food
processor fitted with a steel blade or put through coarse blade of
a food grinder (nuts will help push sticky fruit through). Or, if
desired, finely chop by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in coconut and honey; mix until well combined. If mixture
seems very crumbly, add honey as needed, but do not use too much or
it will become very sticky.
</P>
<P>
   Use your hands to mold walnut-size portions of mixture into
compact 1-inch-diameter balls and, if desired, roll each one in
sugar to coat.
</P>
<P>
   Store in refrigerator. Serve at room temperature for best
flavor. Makes about 36 balls.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHOCOLATE-CHIP MANDELBROT
</P>
<P>
   The original recipe for these mandelbrot (almond bread, in
Yiddish), was given to me long ago by a cousin, and I have adapted
it. Although the original recipe didn't, I double-bake them. They
are quite good either way. The extra baking makes them a little
crunchier.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
3/4 cup canola oil &QL; 
1 1/4 cups sugar &QL; 
3 large eggs OR 3/4 cup pareve egg substitute &QL; 
2 teaspoons vanilla &QL; 
1 teaspoon almond extract &QL; 
1 tablespoon baking powder &QL; 
3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour &QL; 
1/2 to 1 cup slivered OR sliced almonds &QL; 
1 to 1 1/2 cups regular OR miniature chocolate chips
</P>
<P>
   Put oil, sugar and eggs in a large bowl and beat with an
electric mixer until very light and fluffy. Beat in vanilla, almond
extract and baking powder. Add flour and mix in slowly by hand or
heavy-duty electric mixer until completely combined. Finally, stir
in (or use a heavy-duty mixer at lowest speed), almonds and
chocolate chips.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer sticky dough from bowl to a large sheet of plastic
wrap; then wrap dough and press into a large disk. Chill dough at
least 1 hour or until somewhat firm.
</P>
<P>
   Line 2 large baking sheets with cooking parchment or coat with
nonstick cooking spray or grease. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Unwrap dough and divide into 4 equal parts. Transfer 1 part to a
floured surface and coat entire surface of dough lightly with
flour. (Return remainder of dough to refrigerator.) Form chilled
dough into a log that is 2 inches in diameter and about 10 to 11
inches long, using additional flour as needed. Brush off any excess
flour on dough log. Immediately transfer log to one long side of
prepared baking sheet. Repeat to make another log. Keep 2 logs
parallel and at least 2 inches apart, as they expand a lot during
baking. Press in sides of each log with both your hands to even
width of logs along entire length.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven about 25 to 30 minutes or
until lightly browned. (Do not be concerned about cracks that form
on logs.) Loosen from baking sheets with a metal spatula, but leave
in place to cool to at least lukewarm. When first 2 logs are almost
done baking, form remaining 2 logs on another baking sheet and bake
and cool as directed.
</P>
<P>
   When baked logs are cool, carefully slide, one at a time, off
baking sheets onto a cutting board. Use a sawing motion with a
serrated bread knife to crosswise cut each log on diagonal into
5/8-inch-thick to 3/4-inch-thick slices (thinner slices may fall
apart). (Save odd-shaped ends for a nosh; they will quickly
disappear.)
</P>
<P>
   For softer mandelbrot, cool slices completely and serve as is.
If desired, sprinkle slices with sieved powdered sugar.
</P>
<P>
   For crunchier mandelbrot, stand cut slices back on baking sheet
so there is about 1/2-inch between each. Do not lay slices on cut
sides or chocolate will ooze out. Carefully, so slices don't fall
over, put baking sheets back into 350-degree F oven. Toast
mandelbrot 8 to 10 minutes. (They will crisp even more as they
cool.) Remove baking sheet from oven.
</P>
<P>
   If a coating is desired, put some superfine sugar into a small
bowl. Sprinkle both sides of each warm mandelbrot slice with
superfine sugar, shaking excess back into bowl. Cool slices
completely by standing up on a wire rack. Store mandelbrot in
airtight food containers at room temperature up to 1 week or freeze
for longer storage. Makes about 50 mandelbrot slices.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: One end of mandelbrot can also be dipped in melted
semisweet chocolate, if desired.

`SPANISH FLY': WHINING ABOUT MACHISMO GETS THE EXPECTED REWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review.) 
(js) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a shrill, charmless 94-minute episode of ``Sex and the
City'' set in Madrid with a central character who, like Carrie in
that series, is a journalist writing about sex, and you have Daphna
Kastner's abrasive comedy, ``Spanish Fly.'' Ms. Kastner also stars
as Zoe, a whiny, self-absorbed writer for Vanity Fair who has none
of Carrie's spunky sweetness. Armed with a contract to complete a
book on the myth of machismo, Zoe has traveled to Spain to meet and
interview ``macho'' men.
</P>
<P>
   On every Madrid street corner, Zoe observes sexy young couples
in the throes of passion. But whenever a man flirts with Zoe, she
turns surly and hostile. Early in the film she develops an
embattled relationship with Antonio (Toni Canto), a handsome,
womanizing interpreter who infuriates her by playfully
mistranslating her interviewees' remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe falls into a frustrating affair with Carl (Martin Donovan),
the drippy, mild-mannered owner of an English-language bookstore,
but they have no physical chemistry. She is also drawn to Julio
(Antonio Castro), a fiery-eyed flamenco guitarist who fancies
himself Spain's greatest lover and is so vain that during
lovemaking he likes to study his face in a mirror attached to the
headboard.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally Zoe's ex-boyfriend, John (Danny Huston), shows up
in Madrid with his men's group freshly bonded from their rituals in
the woods. In the movie's crude, comic swipe at the men's movement,
these liberated jerks lurch idiotically through the streets
intoning a nonsensical sis-boom-bah-like chant.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Zoe and Antonio travel to Spain's southern coast,
where, it turns out, Zoe's mother met her father, a Spaniard who
never married her. At this point the movie turns into a
mother-daughter psychodrama conducted by long-distance telephone.
Predictably, Antonio turns out to be a much nicer guy than the
movie has previously let on. And after all her whining about men
being dogs who use and abuse women, the movie's solution to Zoe's
malaise is to give her a good noisy roll in the hay with a macho
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spanish Fly'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It has strong language and several
moderately explicit sex scenes.
</P>
<P>

How to light up your Hanukkah celebration 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
( With art , 2 takes) 
By Natalie Haughton 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; At sundown Friday, Jews will begin the eight-day celebration of
Hanukkah, also known as the festival of lights. They will light
candles in the menorah each night until all eight are lit in
remembrance of the miracle that occurred when the Maccabees
defeated their oppressors, who were trying to make the Jews give up
their religion.
</P>
<P>
   Oil, symbolically associated with the miracle oil in the
rededicated temple in Jerusalem, is traditional in Hanukkah
cooking. Latkes _ made with grated potatoes and onions or ricotta
or other cheeses and fried in oil _ long have been a holiday
favorite. Other popular menu items include jelly-filled doughnuts
(known as sufganiyot) and holiday pastries (such as Zelebi,
Bimuelos and Koeksisters), which are also fried in oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lesser-known Hanukkah culinary custom is the partaking of
cheese and all sorts of dairy dishes in honor of the brave Jewish
heroine Judith,'' writes Gloria Kaufer Greene in ``The New Jewish
Holiday Cookbook'' (Times Books; $27.50), a collection of recipes
and customs from different countries around the world. The book is
a revision of an earlier edition which came out in 1985 _ and has
100 new recipes with variations.
</P>
<P>
   Greene is appealing to novices who have never cooked Jewish food
as well as accomplished cooks looking for variety. ``A lot of
people have never learned from their parents how to celebrate the
holidays and have fun with family and friends _ and eat good food
at the same time.'' Her book is designed to teach the basics and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Greene has concentrated on offering updated, quicker,
streamlined recipes along with healthier ingredient options (such
as oil instead of margarine; egg substitute for eggs, etc.) where
possible.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the recipes appear uncomplicated, others have
lengthy ingredient lists and directions (she wanted to make the
recipes fail-proof, she said) that are somewhat off-putting and go
on for several pages. But judge for yourself and pick and choose
the dishes that fit your skills and schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Greene combines the two culinary traditions of
Hanukkah _ dairy dishes and oil-fried foods _ and with her husband
and four children _ hosts a Sunday open house celebration for
family and friends featuring a dairy buffet.
</P>
<P>
   It's a very casual, joyful, fun-filled time and usually includes
dishes like Ricotta Latkes, Potato Latkes, Chili Con Queso,
Quick-and-Easy Cheese Blintz Casserole, Rich-and-Fruity Lokshen
Kugel, a fruit or vegetable salad, an assortment of cookies such as
Chocolate Chip Mandelbrot, Fruit-Nut Confection Balls or Hanukkah
Butter Cookies, and Soft Pretzels or Cinnamon Buns.
</P>
<P>
   If time and energy are at a premium but you still want to
entertain, Greene suggests making one dish you feel really good
about that will impress your guests, then purchasing the rest of
items to complete the menu or have friends contribute a specialty
such as a kugel, salad or dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Greene is a firm believer in preparing as much in advance as
possible _ then freezing or refrigerating the dishes and thawing
and reheating prior to serving. You can make the Ricotta Latkes the
day before and refrigerate them. On the day of the party, arrange
on a serving dish and reheat in the microwave oven just prior to
serving. Be sure to watch them carefully so the pancakes are just
warm and don't end up rubbery, advises Greene. She likes to serve
them with fresh raspberries or strawberries, a little jam and
vanilla yogurt or sour cream.
</P>
<P>
   For best taste and texture, potato latkes should be eaten as
soon as possible after cooking, notes Greene, but they taste almost
as good if made the morning of the party. Reheat them uncovered,
slightly overlapping, in a shallow roasting pan in a 400-degree
oven about six to eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are as many variations of these pancakes as there are
Jewish cooks who make them. Some prefer to saute the onions before
adding the potato shreds; most use raw onions. Some insist on matzo
meal as a thickener; others use flour.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of experimenting, Greene has developed a food
processor technique that requires minimal time. She also uses an
electric peeler to peel the potatoes and an electric skillet to fry
them with little fuss. She believes they taste better and require
less salt if the salt is sprinkled on after cooking _ and not added
to the raw potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The Tex-Mex Chili Con Queso dip is a great party buffet dish and
can be whipped up in minutes with shredded cheese (don't substitute
reduced- or no-fat cheeses), garlic, onions, tomatoes, diced green
chiles and ripe olives. Serve warm from a chafing dish or fondue
pot with corn chips for dipping.
</P>
<P>
   A blintz casserole is Greene's easy answer to serving cheese
blintzes. It has a flavor similar to blintzes but is less work.
Unlike some of the popular casseroles that use store-bought frozen
blintzes, Green's version bakes a layer of cheese filling between
two layers of a special blintz-type batter. To gussy up the baked
casserole, sprinkle the top lightly with cinnamon or
cinnamon-sugar. Offer guests sour cream, applesauce and sliced
fresh fruits to accompany the cut-up squares. This casserole is
another good candidate to bake a day or two ahead and reheat in the
microwave oven before arranging on the buffet table. You can also
freeze it up to twomonths ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that blintzes, latkes and chili con queso don't
have to be served piping hot _ so don't drive yourself crazy.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to sweets _ such as mandelbrot, fruit balls and
butter cookies _ Greene opts for baking everything several days to
several weeks ahead and using the freezer to keep the goodies fresh
up to two to three months. ``If you do a good job of wrapping food
for the freezer, it can be a great time saver. Also, the sweets
will stay fresher than at room temperature or in the refrigerator
for any length of time.'' With a variety of sweets stashed in the
freezer, you can offer a greater assortment on different occasions,
says Greene.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to thaw frozen items, notes Greene, is to leave the
food wrapped and thaw non-perishables on the countertop and
perishables in the refrigerator. Greene believes cooking for the
Jewish holidays should be fun and satisfying _ and manageable for
the cook. ``Most important is that the food tastes and looks
delicious.'' She favors simple garnishes to embellish the food.
``If it doesn't look good, people won't be attracted to it. It's
often been said that what people remember most is the last thing
they ate _ and that's dessert.'' So make it wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, a cooking teacher for 20 years, has created a Web site _
!bold!www.jewishcuisine.com!off! _ to share her excitement about
Jewish cooking and Jewish cuisine. ``It's time for Jewish food to
come into its own as a legitimate cuisine.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, celebrate Hanukkah with these creations from Greene's
book.

STAGING THE GREEKS, WITH MODERN ENERGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Professional theater companies that focus almost
exclusively on classical Greek drama are rare, and there are few
among them that can mount productions with the iconoclastic and
high-voltage energy of the Aquila Theater Company and still win
praise from critics and scholars alike.
</P>
<P>
   Aquila, now company in residence at the Center for Ancient
Studies at New York University, not only specializes in Greek
drama, often in new translations by its producing artistic
director, Peter Meineck, but also performs the works for the most
part in traditional Greek masks. At the same time, its productions
have a sardonic, irreverent edge that pushes its interpretations to
the precipice.
</P>
<P>
   In Aristophanes' ``Birds'' last spring, the score dipped into
snippets of ``There's No Business Like Show Business'' and
``Maria'' from ``West Side Story.'' When Aquila did Sophocles'
``Philoctetes,'' it was set on a Scottish island and used live
Gaelic music. The company played rock anthems from the '70s during
Aristophanes' ``Wasps.'' And its current Lincoln Center production
of ``The Iliad: Book I'' (which opened last Wednesday) is set in a
bunker during the Normandy invasion in World War II. Though this
production does not use traditional masks, it does have a scene
played in gas masks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are extremely good, especially at Aristophanes,'' said
Dr. Helene Foley, a professor of Greek and Latin at Barnard
College. ``The productions are clever and serious. They fill an
incredibly valuable niche.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking classical drama on the road is also part of Aquila's
mission. The company tours relentlessly eight months a year,
traveling to regional theaters from Maine to Florida to Nebraska.
Last year it played to 300,000 people, a number it expects to equal
or excel in the coming season. The Aquila Theater for Young
Audiences, a new project with the Lincoln Center Institute, will
bring one-hour versions of classics to 40 high schools in the New
York City region starting next September.
</P>
<P>
   The hallmark of the company is its ingenious use of masks,
meticulously crafted and adorned with human hair. Copied from Greek
vases of the fifth century B.C., the masks are slightly larger than
life size, and through the actors' controlled body movement express
a flexibility that belie the frozen contours. The masked characters
seem to fill up the stage as they portray the legendary grotesques
of Greek drama.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of actors (there are now nine in the troupe, the first
mixed British-American company approved by Actors Equity) are also
adept at milking the texts for the ribald asides and often bawdy
slapstick. Greek drama, as Meineck's six translations remind the
audience, is often filled with crude and sexually explicit
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you start to translate the texts, which we did early on,
you realize that these texts are written for mask theater,'' said
Meineck, whose translations of Aristophanes and Aeschylus are
published by Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play was prepared for a 17,000-seat open-air theater with
very long entrances,'' he added. ``Characters had to be invested as
soon as they walked on, especially because there were only two or
three actors playing all the roles. The psychology behind the mask
is very different. You are not in naturalistic, kitchen-sink
theater at all. You are in the land of mythos, mythology and
legend.''
</P>
<P>
   The force of the masks onstage, for many scholars, has been
something of a revelation. ``The company saw this problem of the
characterization of people on the Greek stage,'' said Professor
Zeph Stewart, chairman emeritus of the classics department at
Harvard University. ``The Greeks had people playing parts very
different from themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Old men played young men, and men played women,'' he said.
``The solution to this problem came with the masks. I had never
seen a production of Greek drama done in masks. It was
extraordinary. The masks had a remarkable transforming quality. It
was a novel idea, but one that I and most people at Harvard found
convincing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meineck's route to Greek drama was refreshingly unconventional.
He is the son of a builder and grew up in a working-class section
of London. When he was 15, he was expelled from school for fighting
and a year later enlisted in the Royal Marines. Despite his lack of
a formal education, he rose to become an officer. He went back to
school, entering the University of London and finding himself
``overwhelmed by the passionate energy of Greek drama.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>

   ``What I love about the Greek playwrights is that they were so
well rounded,'' he said. ``They were soldiers, politicians and
playwrights. There was a time in my life where I was not the
traditional person who would go into the theater. I immediately
found a connection with these people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aeschylus was at the battle of Marathon. He was regarded as
one of the greatest playwrights the Greeks ever had, and yet when
he was buried in Sicily, all it said on his grave was, `Here lies
Aeschylus who fought at the battle of Marathon.' And that is what
his tomb should have said: In that battle, the Greeks were freed
from the tyranny of the Persians and went on to create the great
democracy that was Athens.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is presenting ``King Lear'' and ``The Iliad''
at the Clark Studio Theater at Lincoln Center through Sunday and
from Jan. 4 through Jan. 8, will return to masked theater next year
with a touring production of ``Oedipus the King,'' in a new
translation by Meineck and Paul Woodruff. The play will be
performed in New York in June.
</P>
<P>
   Some company signatures are apparent in the current productions,
including the carefully stylized ensemble choreography, a part of
mask theater, that often gives the works a dreamy, dancelike
quality. ``The Iliad,'' with the actors dressed as World War II
soldiers, is also aided immensely by the stark and colloquial
translation by Stanley Lombardo.
</P>
<P>
   In a review in The New York Times, D.J.R. Bruckner wrote that
even though Lombardo's language was ``off the streets and out of
barracks, the company's choreographed movement, the chants,
occasional dances and the rhythms of the speeches convey much of
the feeling of the Greek verse: its rumbles and melodies and
silences, the beat of its pulse.''
</P>
<P>
   Meineck said: ``In the fifth century, the Greeks portrayed
Homeric warriors in contemporary battle dress. What they wore as
Hoplites at the battle of Marathon was what Achilles wore. These
people were soldiers, the Greeks wanted to say, just like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Richmond, the company's associate artistic director,
frequently uses electronic music composed by one of the principal
actors, Anthony Cochrane, a Scot who spent several seasons with the
Royal Shakespeare Company. While the sets are sparse, the lighting,
sound effects, staging and costumes are innovative.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Iliad,'' which uses four trunks as stage props, the
presence of the gods is heralded by the sound of bombers. In recent
productions of ``Philoctetes,'' ``Julius Caesar'' and ``The
Birds,'' a large blue silk sheet mutated into the sea, a tent, a
cave, various landscapes and the interior of Julius Caesar's mind.
</P>
<P>
   The company's work is tightly choreographed, a quality that
lends itself to smaller, narrowly focused dramas. Because of its
size, Aquila is forced to cut or double up on many parts as in the
production of ``Lear.'' The more compact ``Comedy of Errors,''
performed last spring, however, fit with the company's whirlwind
style, with the actors dressed as cartoon figures from Tintin.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of Aquila, however, lies in Greek drama. ``Ancient
Greek dramas,'' said Meineck, who teaches at New York University's
Tisch School of the Arts, ``are as much about ritual as theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Many great tragedies, including Aeschylus' ``Oresteia,'' were
taken from Greek myth. Theater, often part of elaborate religious
ceremonies, played a central role in challenging and questioning
the civic and cultural life of Athens. Athenian artists and
philosophers waged a constant war, often onstage, against the
threat of tyranny and monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience can watch Agamemnon and enjoy the basic myth, but
can also compare the myth to life and contemporary politics,''
Meineck said. ``This is why you see Greek drama set in Bosnia,
although this is not necessarily what I would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``People turn to Greek tragedy when they are trying to express
great stress, guilt or emotion. Sometimes it is how you feel about
your wife, your kids, your brother, or your fears about survival.
The `Oresteia,' after all, is about your son overthrowing you and
your wife knowing your darkest secrets. Greek tragedy is a great
leveler.''

`THE BLONDE' WAS A NATURAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Absinthe.'' ``Martinis.'' ``The Cigar.'' And now ``The
Blonde.''
</P>
<P>
   Writer and bon vivant Barnaby Conrad III, 47, probably was born
50 years too late. He is much more at home with the expatriate
spirit of his idols, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and
their favorite Lost Generation couple, Gerald and Sara Murphy
(Fitzgerald's models for Nicole and Dick Diver in ``Tender Is the
Night'').
</P>
<P>
   Conrad's books for Chronicle Publishing are about cultural
icons. The latest two - ``The Blonde'' and, due out in a few weeks,
an illustrated compendium on ``Pan Am,'' the airline that flew the
Clipper out of San Francisco - are a natural progression from his
first book, ``Absinthe,'' which he wrote and then revised
successfully after spending his own ex-pat days in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   He can't help being a peripatetic uber-dilettante with
workaholic habits. It's in his blood. Following in his boulevardier
father's Seven League boots, Conrad's life has been one filled with
adventure, travel lust, pretty women, well-connected friends, good
cigars and, above all, very, very dry gin martinis. Barnaby the
Second owned the famous North Beach club, the Matador (named for
his best-selling book), during the hip `50s. It's as if Conrad the
younger is re-creating Conrad the elder's high life.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it's ``The Blonde: A Celebration of the Golden Era
From Harlow to Monroe,'' with a photograph of Veronica Lake's
famous cascade of wheat-blond hair on the cover. ``I decided not to
use Marilyn Monroe because then the book would be about her,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, he's covered everything from the Clairol slogans
(``Does she, or doesn't she? Only her hairdresser knows for sure''
and ``If I have but one life to live, let me live it as a blonde'')
and the famous `50s blondes - Kim Novak, Grace Kelly, Jayne
Mansfield, England's Diana Dors, Eva Marie Saint (his favorite),
Eva Peron, Brigitte Bardot and Marilyn Monroe - to director Alfred
Hitchcock's blonde fixation, Lady Godiva's ride, and the continuing
myth of the blonde.
</P>
<P>
   As Conrad writes in his introduction: ``Blonde women have
stirred, inspired and bedeviled the imaginations of men and women
for centuries.'' If he was to pick his quintessential blonde, he
says, it would be Marilyn. ``Monroe, as far as I'm concerned, was
The Blonde.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These books are not my life's work,'' says Conrad, relaxing in
a living room cluttered with the effluvia of his travels and
interests - a massive bison head over his fireplace shot by a
Native American rancher from Montana, numerous artifacts in the
shape of martini glasses, including a cocktail table (complete with
olive under glass), Conrad's paintings of Lucky Strike packs (his
favorite design icon) and a fascinating photograph of William
Burroughs making nice to a Colt .45 (not the beer, the pistol).
</P>
<P>
   ``Graham Greene called his work `novels and entertainments,'
which is how I feel about these books,'' says Conrad. ``They were
done largely for fun and came out of my bachelor habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't,'' he interjects very quickly (maybe too quickly?),
``intend being a bachelor forever.''
</P>
<P>
   But the boy can't help it. There's always a new picture to paint
in the rabbit-warren, roof-top studio he rents eight floors above
Pacific Avenue. Or there is a trip to take, like the one he did in
1994 when he went searching for his roots in the wilds of Montana,
where his ancestors, fugitives from Yale, founded a town called
Conrad before coming to California. And there's always another city
like Paris to explore; he lived in the City of Light for five years
in the `80s.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad, a Yalie with the cultured but slightly dangerous mein of
a big-game hunter on sabbatical, says that with ``The Martini,''
``The Cigar'' and now ``The Blonde,'' he is ``tweaking the PC
aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   His subject matter would have been right at home circa 1955 at
the Stork Club in New York. ``Nobody would have thought twice about
it,'' he says. ``My father lived that life and did all that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blonde'' seems to be a natural progression in retro-ship,
given the subjects of his other books. ``The book company asked me
what was next and said, `How `bout Champagne?' Nope, it's been
done. Beer. No. Sex. No. What could I do that wasn't a clichd jump.
The Blonde! Nobody had ever done it.'' (Although now, there are two
books on the market about blondes.)
</P>
<P>
   Conrad's next subject is rum, probably because he can't wait to
get himself down to the Caribbean for ``research.''
</P>
<P>
   The rum thing goes back to when he was living in Paris and was
racked up with a broken jaw for a few months. It was winter, raw
and snowy, but he'd been in all day and felt the need to get some
air. He went out for a jog, took a wrong turn and slipped, falling
into one of Paris' many statues.
</P>
<P>
   At the hospital, his broken jaw was wired shut. ``I got very
tired of soup,'' he says with a laugh, remembering that he was
fixated on liver and onions and even went so far as to cook them
and puree them so he could drink his dinner.
</P>
<P>
   He began to fantasize about rum, and he started painting after a
long hiatus. One of his pictures: a very green, leafy,
tropical-themed canvas with the word ``RUM'' printed in vivid red.
It'll probably be the next book cover.

`WISCONSIN DEATH TRIP': HOW A TOWN IN WISCONSIN WENT MAD
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
By STEPHEN HOLDEN  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may not have a headless horseman charging murderously through
a Gothic forest, but James Marsh's film ``Wisconsin Death Trip''
frequently suggests a semidocumentary offshoot of Tim Burton's
``Sleepy Hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which opens Wednesday in Manhattan, is a visually
audacious riff on Michael Lesy's macabre 1973 cult classic book of
vintage photographs and news clips chronicling the human tragedies
that engulfed the rural farming community of Black River Falls,
Wis., in the 1890s.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with economic depression, a brutal climate and a
diphtheria epidemic that decimated its infant population, a good
number of the town's citizens (most were recent German and
Scandinavian immigrants) went berserk. The murder, suicide and
arson rates skyrocketed. Religious and occult fanaticism ran
rampant, and many citizens of Black River Falls found themselves
incarcerated in the nearby Mendota Asylum for the Insane.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the book consists of formal portraits of Black
River Falls' upright citizens taken by the town photographer,
Charles Van Schaik. Their stony death-mask visages (precursors of
Diane Arbus' most disturbing work) suggest that in the worst of
times the town had deteriorated into a real-life village of the
damned.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying newspaper accounts of the violent acts of the
townspeople are so dryly factual in their understated way that read
alongside grim photographs, they convey a mood of gallows humor.
The very term ``death trip'' has an aura of sardonic hippie
nonchalance.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh's film uses the pictures and reporting as springboards for
re-enactments of some of the most notorious crimes described in the
book. Filmed in smudgy black and white and underscored with
spiritually exalted music (everything from Arvo Part to Faure's
Requiem), they are staged as silent-movie tableaux vivants.
</P>
<P>
   The sardonic tone of the book is accentuated by the voice of Ian
Holm reading the newspaper accounts of the murders and suicides in
an insinuating voice that conveys an attitude of sly, supercilious
amusement. Occasionally he dramatically lowers his voice to a
hissing conspiratorial whisper.
</P>
<P>
   Among the grisliest true vignettes is the story of a 13-year-old
boy who shot an old hermit for kicks, then inhabited his property
until his crime was discovered, after which he fled and engaged in
a gun battle with a pursuing posse. Many of the other murders were
crimes of passion carried out by rejected lovers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to recounting individual murders, the movie has
several stories of notorious local loonies like Mary Sweeney (Jo
Vukelich), a schoolmistress who traveled around Wisconsin snorting
cocaine and breaking windows. (She claimed to have destroyed
$50,000 worth of glass.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Pauline L'Allemand (Marilyn White), a
once-successful European opera singer who arrived in the area
nearly penniless and unsuccessfully tried to find patrons through a
series of musical soirees. She was eventually carted off to the
Mendota Asylum, from which she later escaped.
</P>
<P>
   When the movie is concentrating on the book, it is a creepily
enthralling document that illustrates the susceptibility to
breakdown of what we think of as sanity and civilization. But the
film stumbles in its color sequences, which examine life in Black
River Falls today and imply that the toxins of the 1890s are still
present.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence that life in Black River Falls and in thousands of
similar small towns across America is potentially deadly, the movie
focuses on local parades, beauty contests and other small-town
rituals, and relays newspaper reports of recent crimes that recall
those of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the comparison seems shallow and forced. Life in Black Water
Falls may be bland and homogenized, but it doesn't appear
uncomfortable. Only one scene, in which the camera studies the
stony faces of the residents of an old-age home as they are
serenaded by a male chorus singing ``The Star-Spangled Banner,''
does the contemporary imagery mirror the book's grimmest
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Framing these tales is a vintage Chamber of Commerce-style pitch
that extols the joys of life in Black River Falls and states that
``nowhere in this great continent of ours can be found a more
desirable residence.'' &QL;

MILLENNIAL `GUINNESS' MAKES A BIG DEAL OF TRIVIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some believe humankind's infatuation with ersatz knowledge
kicked in around 1970, when pseudo-intellectuals everywhere
embraced the line, ``Love means never having to say you're sorry,''
from Erich Segal's drippy novel ``Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Others target the '50s/'60s/'70s explosion of TV quiz shows,
when contestants could win lots of money by proclaiming things like
``Mr. Greenjeans'' in response to the question, ``Who was Captain
Kangaroo's farmer friend?''
</P>
<P>
   But the infatuation with trivial knowledge became a legitimate
pastime on Aug. 27, 1955, when the first volume of the Guinness
Book of Records was published. Leisure-afflicted readers could
suddenly learn who was supposed to have thrown a tennis ball the
farthest and discover the identity of the heaviest 8-year-old in
recorded history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for those who like to know a little about a lot, comes
Guinness World Records 2000: Millennium Edition (Guinness, $25.95).
From the owner of the biggest collection of ``Star Wars'' effluvia
(Jason Joiner of London, over 20,000 movie-related toys) to where
you're most likely to be killed (Bogota, Colombia, with an average
of nearly one homicide an hour), Millennium Edition celebrates
facts and figures that are to knowledge what Twinkies are to
nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to remember that the ``records'' presented in any
Guinness publication include only those certified by the
organization. It's entirely possible that somebody has walked a
longer distance than the 33,151 miles strolled by Arthur Blessitt
that is noted in Millennium Edition. But Blessitt's is the longest
walk among those presented to Guinness for record certification.
</P>
<P>
   For those who enjoy posing as masters of the mundane, here's a
trivia test based on items mentioned between Millennium Edition's
silvery, faux-tinfoil covers. Six right is a passing grade; eight
right answers get you an `A.' If you get all 10 correct, our advice
is to get a life.

 &HT;    GORE'S LATE FATHER AN UNSEEN FORCE IN THE CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his travels across the country in pursuit of the
presidency, Al Gore's constant companion is his father.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since Al Gore Sr. died, the obedient son has rarely
given a speech in which the sometimes stern, always exacting father
is not praised, both as a parent and a politician.
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeatedly praises his father's ``great courage'' for
politically unpopular stands against racial segregation in the
South and the U.S. war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But longtime observers suggest that Gore is still trying to win
the approval of a father who was absent during much of his
childhood _ one of the reasons, some believe, that his rhetoric
occasionally strays into overstatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all likelihood, his exaggerations reflect a yearning for a
kind of approval and admiration that he never quite got from his
dad,'' Bob Zelnick, author of ``Gore: A Political Life,'' a highly
critical biography, said in an interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   Zelnick cited Gore's overblown claims of his involvement in the
creation of the Internet, of being the sole inspiration for Oliver
Barrett in Eric Segal's novel ``Love Story,'' and of his ``combat''
experience in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't serious character flaws so much as a notion that
he has not accomplished as much as he should have,'' added Zelnick,
a former ABC News correspondent who now lectures at Boston
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's grandiosity about the guy that's always been there,''
Bill Turque, a Newsweek correspondent and author of ``Inventing Al
Gore,'' a biography to be published next March, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the campaign gaffes are ``a reflection of the great
expectations that his parents, and particularly his father, had for
him,'' added Turque. ``The script that his parents wrote for his
life called for him to be heroic and to save the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not the only presidential candidate with a famous
father. Texas Gov. George W. Bush's father was president of the
United States. Sen. John McCain's father was a four-star admiral.
And Steve Forbes's father was a flamboyant magazine publisher and
jet-setter.
</P>
<P>
   Father-son dynamics have long been a part of presidential
politics, but rarely as much as in this campaign. Cambridge, Mass.,
writer and psychotherapist Michael Vincent Miller has called 2000
``the year of the Oedipal presidency,'' with the principal
candidates either ``running to please Dad or to spite Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   But while some in the current presidential field often rebelled
against their fathers in their youth, Gore was the dutiful son _
responsible, conscientious, eager to please.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a student at Harvard during the rebellious 1960s, Gore
``listened to his father,'' said John Tyson, one of Gore's college
friends. ``He emulated him.''
</P>
<P>
   To suggest, though, that Gore's quest for the White House is an
attempt to fulfill his father's own unrealized dreams or to best
his father is a stretch, said Turque.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is to reduce him to a stereotype,'' Turque said.
``He's already achieved higher office than his father. He's also
past 50 now, and my sense is that he's worked a lot of these things
out about his father. But there's no question that it's still a
force within him, and that he sometimes still lives within that
view of him that his father had.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Gore Sr., a wily larger-than-life Tennessee populist who
entertained voters with speeches and a fiddle, preceded his son in
the House and the Senate. He was elected to the Senate in 1952
after 14 years in the House and nearly won the nod to be Adlai
Stevenson's running mate on the 1956 Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   He is still remembered fondly in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   C.D. Owens, an African American clergy leader in Memphis, noted
in a recent introduction of Gore that the vice president ``came
from good stock,'' that his ``great father fought for justice and
human dignity when it was not popular to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gore began grooming his son for a career in politics
almost from birth. And in 1992, when Bill Clinton picked the
younger Gore as his vice presidential running mate, his father
remarked, ``He was raised for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior Gore lost his Senate seat in 1970, having taken
unpopular stands against school prayer and the Vietnam War and in
favor of gun control and welfare programs at a time when
conservatism was sweeping New Deal liberalism from the South.
</P>
<P>
   He played a large behind-the-scenes role in his son's first
congressional race, in 1974, and in his son's 1988 campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination. His advice that his son run in
every primary rather than only in targeted states is widely viewed
as hastening the end of the 1988 Gore presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Gore died last December at the age of 91, just as his son was
getting ready for another White House race, as the frontrunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was the greatest man I ever knew in my life,'' Gore
told the 1,000 mourners who attended the senior Gore's memorial
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the choices you made,'' he added. ``Dad, your
whole life has been an inspiration.''

 &HT;    GORE'S LATE FATHER AN UNSEEN FORCE IN THE CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his travels across the country in pursuit of the
presidency, Al Gore's constant companion is his father.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since Al Gore Sr. died, the obedient son has rarely
given a speech in which the sometimes stern, always exacting father
is not praised, both as a parent and a politician.
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeatedly praises his father's ``great courage'' for
politically unpopular stands against racial segregation in the
South and the U.S. war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But longtime observers suggest that Gore is still trying to win
the approval of a father who was absent during much of his
childhood _ one of the reasons, some believe, that his rhetoric
occasionally strays into overstatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all likelihood, his exaggerations reflect a yearning for a
kind of approval and admiration that he never quite got from his
dad,'' Bob Zelnick, author of ``Gore: A Political Life,'' a highly
critical biography, said in an interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   Zelnick cited Gore's overblown claims of his involvement in the
creation of the Internet, of being the sole inspiration for Oliver
Barrett in Eric Segal's novel ``Love Story,'' and of his ``combat''
experience in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't serious character flaws so much as a notion that
he has not accomplished as much as he should have,'' added Zelnick,
a former ABC News correspondent who now lectures at Boston
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's grandiosity about the guy that's always been there,''
Bill Turque, a Newsweek correspondent and author of ``Inventing Al
Gore,'' a biography to be published next March, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the campaign gaffes are ``a reflection of the great
expectations that his parents, and particularly his father, had for
him,'' added Turque. ``The script that his parents wrote for his
life called for him to be heroic and to save the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not the only presidential candidate with a famous
father. Texas Gov. George W. Bush's father was president of the
United States. Sen. John McCain's father was a four-star admiral.
And Steve Forbes's father was a flamboyant magazine publisher and
jet-setter.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    BRITISH DENY RESPONSIBILITY FOR DAMAGE TO GREEK MARBLE
STRUCTURES
 &HT;    (350&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The battle over the Elgin Marbles continued Tuesday as
archaeology experts opened a symposium focusing on damage to the
precious carvings during a cleaning by British technicians in the
late 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was held against the backdrop of a larger dispute
between Britain and Greece over the sculptures, which were removed
from the Parthenon in Athens nearly 200 years ago and brought to
Britain. The 17 figures and section of a 160-yard frieze from the
temple on the summit of the Acropolis are on public display at the
British Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The symposium, which continues Wednesday, is an attempt by the
museum to clear the air on the handling of the precious carvings.
It is likely to spur a new round of Greek demands to return the
sculptures taken when Lord Elgin was the British ambassador to the
Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century. The British government
argues that the museum has the marbles legally.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has been accused of defacing the marbles and then
trying to hide the severity of the damage. The museum denies it has
tried to hide anything, and some experts argue that much of the
damage is the result of the sculptures' being 2,500 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen conservation and archaeology specialists met at the
museum in London to examine documents and visual evidence. After an
earlier examination, Greek archaeologists determined that they were
damaged during a cleaning carried out 60 years ago. The sculptures
were scraped and cleaned using wire brushes and copper chisels, the
Greek scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the meeting was intended to be a scholarly exercise,
passions were nevertheless evident. One angry Greek delegate
reportedly yelled: ``You're grabbers. We'll take them back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Jenkins, a senior British Museum academic, argued that most
of the damage was the result of weathering atop the Acropolis for
two millennia. Jenkins said that only between 10 and 20 percent of
the damage was caused by the cleaning, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   However, Theodore Skoulikidis, the head of the Greek delegation,
argued that most of missing surface was removed by the British
cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Robert Anderson, the director of the British Museum, said the
museum wants to clear the air on the marbles. ``The purpose of our
conference is to revisit the cleaning of 60 years ago and to
attempt to reach a broad consensus on what happened to the
sculptures,'' Anderson said. ``At the same time we shall look at
wider issues surrounding the cleaning of art works.''
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing the conclusions of a team of experts, Greece's
culture minister on Monday said the precious marbles were severely
damaged. Many of the marble surfaces were smoothed out and stripped
of original details such as chiselled grooves that characterize the
architectural work of the Parthenon. ``There truly was a barbarous
cleaning,'' Elisavet Papazoi told The
</P>
<P>
   Associated Press after reading a Greek report. ``The marbles
were tortured.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain maintains that Elgin acquired the sculptures legally
when Greece was ruled by the Ottomans.
</P>
<P>
   Papazoi stressed that the symposium is ``clearly a scientific
meeting'' and not a deliberation on the marbles' repatriation.
``But we believe and hope that the presentation from the Greek side
of the reality that exists after the 1937-38 cleaning of the
marbles will have some positives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit to the Acropolis earlier this month, President
Clinton gave his personal support to Greece's campaign to reclaim
the statues. Britain's Prince Charles also reportedly has voiced
his support.

 &HT;    Charlene Tilton used to hate tabloid gossips...Now she is one
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Big paychecks are in the past. Limos are long
gone. No one's asking for autographs. But Charlene Tilton still
gets those double takes _ Isn't that? Wasn't she?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she was. But teenage tart Lucy Ewing on the CBS prime-time
soap ``Dallas'' is 40 now. She's a single, working mom who recently
broke show-biz ranks when she signed on as the Boca Raton,
Fla.-based Globe's gossip columnist.
</P>
<P>
   The actress who was savaged weekly by the grocery-store tabloids
during her early '80s slugfest divorce from country singer Johnny
Lee (Looking For Love In All the Wrong Places) is now making her
living as a professional gossip, whose column items include:
</P>
<P>
   ``Natalie Portman freaks out over dog poop''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Maguire beauty wants to bed Beatle Paul''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rod Stewart rejects gal, 33 _ she's `too old'''
</P>
<P>
   But she will eat lunch again in Tinsel Town and, in fact, she's
doing it now. She has just finished a Where-are-they-now? interview
with a British TV crew and is having lunch at the private Le
Montrose Hotel dining room. Just off Sunset Strip, it's discreet,
hidden and a favorite of pop and rap groups. Rapper E40 is in the
house, his entourage doing figure-eights in the lobby, jewelry
jingling, as they wheel and deal on cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Tilton picks at a Caesar salad, talking about the days when she
made, not reported, tabloid news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was on the cover every week,'' she says. ``It got to
the point it was really difficult. Now I can laugh about it, but
then it wasn't funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilton made her name playing the oft-married, illegitimate
daughter of black sheep Gary Ewing. She stuck with the show from
1978 to '90 with a two-year break in the middle. She left the show
a year before it ended to retreat to the middle-class suburbs and
raise the daughter she had with Johnny Lee. Cherish is now 17,
attends a performing arts high school, and wants to be an actress.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe job, Tilton begins, ``is an interesting way to
reintroduce and reinvent myself. It's never been done to have an
actor, celebrity, do a column for a tabloid.'' She has no idea if
it will cost her possible acting jobs. ``It remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   She told her editors not to expect sleaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way I want to do anything that's slanderous or
malicious or mean-spirited or sarcastic. It's not my nature, I
don't believe in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The British TV crew that paid Tilton union scale (that's counted
in hundreds, not thousands) for an interview finds her in the
hotel's dining room. They had interviewed Tilton, Linda Gray and
Patrick Duffy separately and now they want to stir up bad blood
``Dallas''-style. They want `Lucy' to pop into the lobby _ cameras
rolling _ and reunite with former ``Dallas'' stablemate ``Sue
Ellen,'' whom she hasn't talked to in several years.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tilton leaves the table, she swears there's no animosity
between her and Gray. She blasts into the lobby, scattering E40's
people. They stop talking on their phones long enough to figure out
why a buxom blonde is rushing, calling to an older woman who's
leaving the hotel with an entire wardrobe slung over her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The shocked look and quick recovery on Gray's face could have
been a scene from ``Dallas'' _ Sue Ellen seeing middle-aged Lucy
coming at her. The Brits are ecstatic with the impromptu ambush.
</P>
<P>
   But any ``Dallas'' bad blood that once boiled in Tilton has
simmered to steam. Producers didn't invite her back for the
``Dallas'' reunion movies in 1996 and '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pissed, really mad,'' she says, returning to her salad.
``It was odd, but what can you do? But actually, it was probably
better. My God, can you imagine Lucy, 80 years old in a hayloft
with the foreman? Not a pretty picture.''
</P>
<P>
   After Tilton left the show, she worked occasionally, mostly bad
movies. Silence of the Hams, Deadly Bet, Ragin' Cajun, Border
Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   She did land a few good jobs, such as London stagework in Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1990).
</P>
<P>
   When Tilton recently decided to get back into acting and hire an
agent, she hit the harsh reality of limited roles for women who are
closer in age to 50 than 30. ``My agent submitted me for a part to
play a mother and they said, `We don't see her as a mother.' I am a
mother. That's all I am,'' she says, delighting in the irony.
</P>
<P>
   She did land a job in the John Travolta-produced feature Bar
Hopping, not yet out. ``It's a comedy based on L.A. bar life. I
play an aging, bitter actress,'' she says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Tilton, who never met her father, is a second-generation mom
devoted to her daughter. Her mother, Katherine, 78, worked as a
single mom, a secretary at an insurance agency. She did the best
she could, but Tilton is never far from the memories of shabby
Hollywood apartments.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Dallas,'' the money went fast _ ``Bad investments. I
trusted the wrong people. I took care of my mom and she had a lot
of health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilton says it was a no-brainer trading career for family. ``I'm
a great daughter to my mother. And, I am a great mother who has
raised an unbelievably productive, kind-hearted, compassionate
member of society.''
</P>
<P>
   She's convincing when she says she has no regrets, doesn't miss
the always-new Mercedes or the jewelry she was fond of flaunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lifestyle changed, but it's actually better,'' she says.
``I need one car (she drives a Prelude), I don't need three cars.
To me, my career was what I did, it's not who I am. I am my
daughter's mother. I think that there's a big difference. People
might look at my house and say, 'Oh, she's not successful.' Maybe I
don't have as much money as the next person, but I am
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   And she's convinced that Cherish will hit big in the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so talented, so dedicated. She'll make it. She'll be
starring on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   Mom and daughter take dance lessons together. Mom advises
daughter on auditions, helps with scripts. Mom won't let daughter
get a driver license yet. ``It depends on grades,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   One perk that goes with the Globe job is that Tilton is back on
the party circuit. ``I was out of that so long.'' But only if there
are no mom duties to be done. ``We get up at 6. She goes to a
performing arts school. I pick her up, we get home at 7. She has
two hours of homework a night, at least. I make dinner. That's our
life. Cherish is my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, too. It's college day at Cherish's high school. Mom has
to return where there are no spotlights or applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to go to the bank,'' she says. ``Stop at my mom's. Go
home and do laundry and help Cherish with her homework. She has an
essay due. I'll get her to bed early.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's 17 and I still make her lunch every morning.''

 &HT;    Few TV stars have enough versatility to create back-to-back hits
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ One of the fastest ways to fail in the
prime-time TV game is to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Actors who come off a big hit rarely follow up the success with
another hit. Think of prime-time actors in recent hits.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time you saw Rob Morrow (''Northern
Exposure''), Gary Burghoff (''MASH'') or Delta Burke (''Designing
Women'')?
</P>
<P>
   You need an old TV pro to explain the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you why,'' says Eddie Foy III, a casting director
since 1962. For prime-time series TV, ``writers, producers and
directors write the material for the limitations or expansions of
that character and that person. You write to their ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike TV, where a role is contoured to the actor, stage and
film work requires that actors fit the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your job once you have gotten the (movie or stage) role is to
bring the role to life,'' Foy says. ``The role has breadth, the
role has passion. But it happens to be sitting on an inanimate
object called paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Foy, 64, is the son of an actor and grandson of a legendary
vaudevillian. He's been casting top TV shows going back to ``The
Monkees'', ``The Donna Reed Show'' and ``Barney Miller.'' He was
the casting boss at both ABC and NBC and his film credits include
``MASH'' and ``The Posiden Adventure.'' He is currently the casting
director for Dick Clark Productions and has been casting the Jerry
Lewis Labor Day Telethon since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Actors coming off a TV hit, Foy suggests, must get back to
studying acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that they don't have talent, it's just that they've
gotten pigeon-holed into doing something, and from there you've got
problems. They can't handle the other stuff. And you know what's so
sad? It happens mostly with children.''
</P>
<P>
   Foy concludes, ``when you take a cast from Show A that has good
looking and pretty people who are minimal in their talent but
within the scope of what they're doing, they're wonderful, that's
great. But then all of a sudden, they're canceled, where do they
go?''

 &HT;    Where are other former prime-time soap stars working?
 &HT;    (EDS: Runs with TILTON-COX and WASHEDUP-ACTORS-COX.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ FALCON CREST (CBS _ 1981-90)
</P>
<P>
   Robert Foxworth: After playing ``Crest'''s Chase Gioberti until
1987, he resurfaced in '92 in the failed CBS soap ``2000 Malibu
Road.'' In 1998, he returned to Broadway opposite Jane Alexander in
``Ivanov.'' He was last seen on network TV in the NBC sitcom
``Lateline.''
</P>
<P>
   _ DALLAS (CBS _ 1978-91)
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hagman: Dressed as oil mogul J.R. Ewing, he recently
worked as a pitchman in Romania for Russian Lukoil. ``Dallas'' was
a favorite on Romanian TV. After his well-publicized liver
transplant in 1995, Hagman starred in the fast-canceled drama
``Orleans.'' Last year, he appeared in the feature film ``Primary
Colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Gray: J.R. Ewing's oft-abused wife, Sue Ellen, is a
goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Population Fund. Along
with the ``Dallas'' reunion movies in '96 and '98, she last did
network series work in 1994-95, first joining the cast of ``Melrose
Place'' and then spinning off to star in the short-lived ``Models,
Inc.'' Her daughter Kehly Sloane runs her production company.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Principal: The former Pamela Barnes Ewing did a TV
movie (''Mistress'') after she left ``Dallas'' in 1987. Produced
and starred in the TV movie ``Naked Lie'' in 1989. Tried stage work
in ``Love Letters'' (1990) and is a recurring character in The WB
network show ``Jack &AMP; Jill.''
</P>
<P>
   _ KNOTS LANDING (CBS _ 1979-93)
</P>
<P>
   Michele Lee: She backed up her acting career by writing scripts,
directing and a singing career. She rode ``Knots'' (as Karen
MacKenzie) until it dropped and then moved to TV movies. In 1996,
she co-wrote, directed and starred in the Lifetime cable movie
``Color Me Perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Van Ark: She had impressive stage credits before playing
Valene Ewing on ``Dallas''/''Knots.'' She has directed TV movies,
worked the stage in Edward Albee's ``Three Tall Women'' (1995) in
New York and ``Star Dust'' in L.A. (1997). She last appeared as
Valene Ewing in the reunion movie ``Knots Landing: Back to the
Cul-de-Sac,'' also in '97.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Shackelford: He landed a job in the Fox show ``Manchester
Prep,'' a show so bad it was canceled in October before it aired.
After playing Gary Ewing on ``Dallas''/''Knots,'' did TV movies and
guest shots on the CBS sitcom ``Cybil.''
</P>
<P>
   _ DYNASTY (ABC _ 1981-89)
</P>
<P>
   Linda Evans: She spent time in an L.A. court this summer trying
to extricate herself from two partners in 11 San Francisco-area
Linda Evans Fitness Clubs. She claimed breach of contract. After
playing Audra in ``The Big Valley'' and Krystle in ``Dynasty,''
Evans spent the past several years selling exercise stuff and
serving 10 years as the wife of new age musician Yanni. That job
ended last year. She did the '91 ``Dynasty'' reunion movie and the
'97 USA movie ``The Stepsister.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Collins: She's still in the tabloids fighting with her
fiction-writing sister Jackie Collins. An accomplished British
stage actress long before playing evil Alexis Carrington Colby
until '89, Collins, 66, can seemingly land jobs _ stage or TV _ at
will. The tiff with Jackie is reportedly based on Joan getting a $4
million advance for two books, the second so bad that the publisher
sued to get $1.3 mil back. Alexis, um, Joan, won in court. Her last
network soap, ``Pacific Palisades,'' died a quick death in '97.

   FBC-REFS-SUSPENDED _ The Southeastern Conference has suspended

Atlanta. (Barnhart, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 12.
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   FBC-TECH-UGA _ The fallout continues from Georgia Tech's 51-48
overtime victory over Georgia. Tech head coach George O'Leary said
Tuesday ``that the better team won _ period'' and that the Georgia
folks need to learn to lose with class. (Clemons, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 14.
</P>
<P>
   FBC-GATORS-KICKER _ GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Florida placekicker Jeff
Chandler reached the lowest point of his career when he missed the
key extra-point attempt in the wild regular-season loss to Alabama.
Entering the rematch in Saturday's SEC title game, Chandler is
riding high. Since the Alabama game, Chandler has been one of the
nation's most consistent kickers. Now, he hopes to get another
chance - maybe with a game-winning field goal on the line - against
the Crimson Tide. (Towers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.
</P>
<P>
   FBC-BAMA-DEFENSE _ TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ Alabama has been riding
the wave of its strong offense throughout the season, but the
Crimson Tide players believe that defense will be the key in
Saturday's SEC championship game against Florida. After allowing a
season-high 39 points to the Gators, Alabama has allowed an average
of less than 17 points in its last six games. (Arey, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 18
</P>
<P>
   GASOUTHERN _ Georgia Southern has the highest scoring offense in
Division I-AA and opened the national playoffs last weekend with a
72-29 victory over Northern Arizona. Most of the publicity has gone
to standout running back Adrian Peterson, a two-time All-American.
But a lot of the responsibility falls on the shoulders of
quarterback Greg Hill, who accounted for six touchdowns against
Northern Arizona. With the Eagle defense continuing to struggle,
Hill and the offense will need another strong performance in
Saturday's quarterfinal against Massachusetts. (Reese, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 15.

<P>
   HKN-CONCUSSIONS _ Nelson Emerson will likely miss two weeks
after becoming the fifth Thrashers player to suffer a concussion
this season. Concussions are becoming more common in the NHL
despite the use of helmets and other precautions. The reason is the
increased speed of the game and the size of the players. Several
players have had to retire because of post-concussion syndrome.

 The Latest American Food Craze _ Sushi   By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  California rolls have nudged aside chicken nuggets
on lunch trays in Palo Alto schools. At Wolfe's Lunch in San
Francisco, truckers order sushi instead of cheeseburgers. And on
bar mitzvah buffets throughout the Bay Area, sushi trays threaten
to crowd out traditional challah.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like pizza and tacos before it, the Japanese delicacy that
combines seasoned rice with bites of fish and vegetables is the
latest food import to go mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   First created some 1,300 years ago, sushi has shown up in such a
variety of places over the past year that it has become the great
American equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers take it to school. Young dot-com workers wait in line
for hours to get into San Francisco's hippest sushi bars.
Homemakers eat it on the run. Construction workers pack it in their
lunch pails. A cosmetic company even named a nail polish ``sushi.''
</P>
<P>
   Sushi's popularity reflects the nation's obsession with eating
healthier, people in the business say. But it also reflects
America's constantly evolving ethnic makeup and palate.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Americans make up about 12 percent of the United
State's 10 million people of Asian ancestry. In the early 1990s,
when the first of two recessions hit Japan, the number of Japanese
immigrants increased sharply to about 10,000 a year, said Karl
Matsushita of the Japanese-American National Library in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   That gave American sushi bars a bump in business, but he and
others say it's not why sushi has become so popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because of the Caucasians as much as Japanese,''
said Matsushita. ``I don't think they're interested in Japanese
culture. They think it's a health food and it doesn't taste bad.
All my friends who I went to college with are popping sushi like
doughnuts. It seems like it happened overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Sushi crosses all sorts of other ethnic boundaries. San Mateo
mother Lisa Murphy says her 10-year-old daughter, who is Caucasian,
gingerly considers trading her peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
with Japanese-American school chums who bring sushi for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lunches are absolutely beautiful, traditional sushi,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   A Korean family runs Wolfe's Lunch, a classic diner in San
Francisco's Potrero Hill district. They added sushi to their
regular menu of bacon, eggs and burgers a few years ago. They also
sell Korean dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area, especially with the ethnic influence, is
changing, so you have all kinds of people in the area that
influence the taste,'' said Allen Kim, whose parents bought the
diner in 1979. ``It's a natural for us to serve sushi along with
the typical diner food. It's the American way, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 90 percent of all the new Japanese restaurants that open
in the Bay Area will feature sushi, said Takehiko Yasuda, president
of the California Japanese Restaurant Association, which represents
120 restuarants. That's up from 70 percent a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Andronico's supermarkets began selling sushi in its Stanford
store about three years ago. It caught on quickly in San Francisco,
Berkeley and Los Altos Andronico's, and now the Danville store
sells more sushi than any other, President and CEO Bill Andronico
said.
</P>
<P>
   At International Marine Products, a San Mateo-based fish
wholesaler that provides top-grade fish to restaurants and
food-service companies, business is so good that the number of
employees has almost doubled in six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got sushi bars all along the way from here to the
Sierras and Reno,'' said assistant branch manager Glenn Sakata.
``Even Fairfield and Truckee _ places you'd never really imagine
there'd be a sushi bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a matter of taste or a concern about bacteria and
parasites in raw fish, new sushi eaters aren't necessarily shoving
down pieces of nigiri or other uncooked styles of sushi. Rather,
they're eating California rolls with avocado and cooked crab or
other versions that feature vegetables or cooked shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   Because more than 90 percent of raw fish eaten in the United
States is first frozen to kill parasites and bacteria, it's
relatively safe, according to the Food and Drug Administration. But
raw fish is not recommended for elderly, young children, people
with cancer, liver disease or compromised immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Alva Spence, food service manager for the Palo Alto Unified
School District, said that's why raw fish isn't part of the school
menu.
</P>
<P>
   But students, who made it clear in a Girl Scout food survey that
they wanted sushi at school, eat plenty of California or vegetarian
rolls. Five pieces sell for $1.90 _ milk, salad and fruit included.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very popular, which I think surprised a lot of
people,'' Spence said.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, sushi enjoyed its first wave of popularity
among Yuppies in the 1980s. That trend gave birth to upscale,
Americanized sushi bars like SoMa's Blowfish and Tokyo Go Go in the
Mission District, both of which opened in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   But sushi's appeal has spread beyond the young and trendy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you believe now older people are eating sushi?'' said
sushi chef Steve Fuji of Ebisu in San Francisco. ``An 83-year-old
came in and said she tried it the first time three months ago and
now has to have it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even teenagers like Oakland's Sam Eckhouse are running to the
sushi bar instead of to Taco Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother got me into it when I was 10 or so,'' says
Eckhouse, a 16-year-old high school student who eats sushi about
once a month _ or whenever he can afford it. ``It's not like most
food. There's a lot of flavor and variety to choose from. It's like
an art.''
</P>
<P>
   California, the birthplace some 20 years ago of the top-selling
California roll, is leading the nation's broad new fascination with
sushi. The rest of the country is catching up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 18 months it's been a quickly growing trend. Now
it's everywhere _ Costco even,'' said Lisa McCue, spokesperson for
the Grocery Manufacturers of America.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in sushi is turning up in the most unexpected parts of
the country. Last summer, Lawrence Pong, principal environmental
health inspector for the San Francisco Department of Public,
presented a seminar on how to safely prepare sushi and other Asian
food at health conferences in Tennessee and Denver. The seminars
were the first of their kind, Pong said.
</P>
<P>
   Want more proof that sushi is on the rise among America's
lunch-bucket set?
</P>
<P>
   _ The October issue of ``Restaurants and Institutions,'' a
magazine read by foodservice workers in schools, military bases and
prisons, named sushi as a rising star, based on a survey of
food-service menus around the country.
</P>
<P>
   _ Advanced Fresh Concepts, a California sushi franchise,
reported this year that it had opened sushi counters in more than
500 supermarkets in the United States and Canada. Two of their
Michigan stores pull in as much as $4,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the International Dairy Deli Bakery Association, a
1,200-member organization based in Wisconsin, the Japanese staple
has generated more inquiries and revenue from stores this year than
ever before, said spokesman lan Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We here in the Midwest have the perception it is more popular
where you are. But it holds a lot of interest with people here _
not the raw stuff, though,'' he said. ``In this country, I don't
think raw fish will ever be that popular.''

BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; A Historical Timeline of Sushi in America &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tracing exactly how and when Americans made sushi their own is
something of an inexact science. In many ways, food scholars and
cultural anthropologists say, it is the pizza of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s and '30s, Italian immigrants had just begun opening
small pizzerias. The food they served was considered very exotic,
said Bertram Gordon, a food historian and acting provost at Mills
College in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   GIs who ate pizza in Italy during World War II helped popularize
the version being baked in America. Then, when more Americans began
traveling to Europe in the 1950s, Italian food became even more
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   After a few decades of Americanization, pizza with all sorts of
very un-Italian toppings like pineapple and ham, became de rigueur.
Today, pizza parlors are as ubiquitous as hamburger stands.
</P>
<P>
   Sushi is on the same trajectory, Gordon says. As part of a
research project, he searched through the Readers' Guide to
Periodical Literature, which reflects popular culture from 1890 to
present. Sushi was first mentioned in the popular press in the
United States in 1964. But it remained largely an exotic food until
the '80s, when eating it became a Yuppie badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   The trend was fueled by an increase in business and culture
exchanges between America and Japan in the 1980s, according to
Bertram and sushi experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese (culture) got popular after `Shogun,' the TV show,''
said sushi chef Steve Fuji of Ebisu in San Francisco. The series
ran in 1980. ``After that, there was a boom.''

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Panelists Belly Up to Supermarket Sushi   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  As the sushi craze continues, more markets are
carrying premade sushi in their refrigerator cases. Most markets
contract a company to make the sushi for them, but many of these
companies have employees in each market making the sushi throughout
the day.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But how good is it? Today's panel tasted five California rolls _
cucumber, avocado and crab (either real or faux) wrapped in seaweed
and rice _ available at local markets. Most come six pieces to a
package and cost $3.19-$5.75 per package.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the tasters were not impressed. The biggest complaint
was the fishy flavor of many of the rolls, although the rolls were
bought at the stores the morning of the tasting.
</P>
<P>
   First place went overwhelmingly to  &UR; AFC &LR;  (seven ounces,
$3.95-$4.50 at many supermarkets), the brand found most frequently
at Bay Area grocers. Two panelists commented on the fresh look and
taste; one particularly liked the flavor of the sesame seeds. Two
would buy it, two might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Andronico's &LR;  (six pieces, $4.99 at Andronico's) came in second.
Andronico's hires its own sushi-makers rather than contracting with
an outside company. One panelist thought the flavor was decent,
while another liked the ratio of rice to crab. But others thought
the crab tasted overwhelmingly fishy and fake. One would buy it,
one might buy it, and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kikka &LR;  (seven ounces, $5.75 at Whole Foods), came in third,
just five points below Andronico's. Kikka is the only brand that
claims to use fresh crab, rather than the standard imitation
product. Two panelists noted an unpleasant fishy flavor, although
one conceded that the other elements of the roll were fine. One
might buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Koho &LR;  (six pieces, $4.99 at Safeway) came in fourth, but
panelists were divided. One described it as ``tasting a lot better
than it looks.'' Others objected to the avocado, which was turning
brown, and the crab, which they described as dry and stringy. One
might buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kami &LR;  (10 ounces, $3.19 at Trader Joe's) was fifth. Three
panelists thought the filling was more like crab salad than the
traditional center of a California roll. None would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Shelley Handler,
consultant and food writer; Donna Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe for All
Seasons, San Francisco; Kim Severson, Chronicle staff writer; and
Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are

 FOOD IN THE NEWS: Chew Your Sushi Well... Tiny Travelers Enjoy 
 Sushi, Too  By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Seafood accounts for about 15 to 20 percent of all
food-poisoning outbreaks in the United States every year.
<P>
   Health experts don't know how many of those cases are related to
eating raw fish in sushi, but Lawrence Pong, principal inspector
for the San Francisco Department of Public Health, isn't too
worried about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks? Not much,'' he says. That's because most of the raw
seafood used in sushi is blast frozen to minus 31 degrees for 15
hours, or minus 10 degrees for seven days, as per Food and Drug
Administration's 1990 recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger concern, he says, is hepatitis A. The Bay Area is six
years into a serious outbreak of the virus, which can be
transmitted when cold or uncooked foods are handled by people who
have not properly washed their hands after using the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Improperly handled raw fish can also carry a host of nasty but
rare bugs. Chief among them are bacteria and a thin round worm
called anisakid nematode. The worms live in marine mammals and are
picked up by fish that come in contact with the mammals or their
excrement.
</P>
<P>
   Freezing kills the worms. So does chewing. Seafood safety expert
Bob Price at the University of California at Davis says that
nationwide about a half dozen cases of people coughing up a
nematode are recorded each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't have chewed their sushi very thoroughly,'' he says.
``If you cough it up, it doesn't hurt you, but it turns you off to
sashimi.''
</P>
<P>
   If the worms aren't killed by freezing, chewing or cooking or if
they aren't removed through visual inspection, they can lodge in
the intestinal wall. Only about 10 such cases are recorded in the
United States each year. But many incidents might go undetected
because people get sick but cough up the worm before it burrows in,
says Janet McDonald, a Bay Area spokesperson for the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA recommends that the elderly or people with cancer, liver
disease or compromised immune systems avoid all raw seafood.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not only because of the parasites but the fact that
freezing does not kill bacteria or viruses,'' McDonald says. ``Add
problems from the food handler and you'd have no barrier because
it's not going to be cooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Marinating raw fish in citrus juice or vinegar _ as in ceviche _
does not kill all the bacteria and parasites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lime juice only makes them angry. That's why they thrash
around,'' says the health department's Pong, who advises people to
visually examine any raw seafood for worms before they eat it.
</P>
<P>
   Some raw seafood is safer than others. Shellfish are potentially
the most dangerous because they most readily absorb whatever toxins
or bacteria are in the water. Freshwater fish, which can harbor
lung flukes, tapeworms and pathogens from human waste, are next on
the list. Deep seawater fish such as tuna have the smallest chance
of infestation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is if you want to eat sushi and sashimi, stick with
open water fish like the tunas that don't come close to marine
mammal populations,'' says Price of UC Davis.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Le Colonial's Italian Ice Adorns Fresh 
 Oysters   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  It doesn't happen often, but once in a while a
dish comes along that is so clever and makes such good sense that
you wonder why everyone doesn't do it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm talking about the Chile, Lime and Mint Granita that is
spooned over fresh oysters at Le Colonial, the chic Vietnamese
restaurant that took over the spot that once housed Trader Vic's.
</P>
<P>
   A spoon of this intensely flavored ice not only keeps the
oysters chilled, but as it melts it creates a delicious sauce that
pools in the shells. The combination of chile, lime and just a hint
of mint is a miraculous pairing with the oysters.
</P>
<P>
   The dish is also perfect for the environment of Le Colonial _
with gently swirling fans, delicate palm trees and rattan
furniture, it looks like a French-inspired tropical plantation.
</P>
<P>

 LEARNING TO COOK: Old Favorite Slips Into Busy Holiday Lifestyle 
 &HT;     By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  This is the time of year when quiche Lorraine
shines. It is quick, simple to make and a soothing dish for lunch
or supper around the holidays.
<P>
   Quiche Lorraine is just one of a number of wonderful recipes
that have become forgotten classics. My friend Sharon Kramis
recently gave me her recipe for quiche, which consists of a savory
(nonsweet) custard, made of eggs and rich milk, and grated Gruyere
cheese baked in a tart shell.
</P>
<P>
   This basic recipe may be varied by adding one or two of the
following: bits of cooked bacon, sliced mushrooms, diced ham,
chopped cooked onion, or just about anything you like.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to make a version using grated Gruyere and cooked
chopped bacon _ and I skipped the tart shell. I sprinkled the
cheese and bacon into a buttered 8-inch pie plate, then I carefully
poured in the custard and popped it into the oven. It baked in just
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While it was baking I toasted some thin slices of rye bread to
serve with it. Since the quiche did not have a crust, the toast
provided a pleasant crispy contrast to the silken custard.
</P>
<P>
   I also made Sharon's relish/salad, which provided the perfect
crunchy/ tart balance to the quiche. To make it, chop 3 celery
stalks and 2 cored but unpeeled apples. Toss them with a dressing
made of 4 tablespoons olive oil, 11/2 tablespoons rice vinegar and
a little salt.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
QUICHE LORRAINE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   5 slices of bacon (optional)
</P>
<P>
   8-ounce chunk Gruyere cheese (11/2 cups grated)
</P>
<P>
   4 eggs
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter an 8-inch pie pan (one
that holds 2 cups liquid).
</P>
<P>
   Separate the slices of bacon and stack them evenly on top of
each other. Cut them into 1/2-inch slices crosswise.
</P>
<P>
   Put a skillet on the stove and turn the heat to medium. Separate
the little slices of bacon and spread them in one layer in the
skillet. Cook, turning them over after 2 or 3 minutes. Cook the way
you like bacon, soft or crisp. When the bacon looks brown around
the edges it is almost to the crisp stage. Using a fork, lift the
pieces of bacon from the skillet and place on paper towels to
drain. Pat the bacon with paper towels to sop up the fat. Set the
bacon pieces aside.
</P>
<P>
   Using a hand grater, grate 11/2 cups cheese onto a piece of wax
paper. Press the grated cheese into a measuring cup, it doesn't
need to be packed firmly, but press a little so you have a generous
amount of cheese.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mixing the custard:  &LR; Crack the eggs into 1-quart mixing bowl or
a quart liquid measuring cup. Add the half-and-half and, using a
fork or rotary beater, briskly beat the milk and eggs until they
are well blended and a homogeneous color. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Assembling the quiche:  &LR; Spread the bacon pieces over the bottom
of the buttered pie pan. Sprinkle the grated cheese evenly over the
bacon, then carefully pour in the egg mixture.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Baking the quiche:  &LR; Put the quiche into the oven and bake for
20 minutes. Test for doneness by inserting the blade of a table
knife into the center of the custard. If it comes out clean _ no
uncooked egg clinging to it _ it is done. Remove the pan from the
oven and let sit for 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cut into four equal wedges and, using a spatula, gently lift
each wedge onto a serving plate.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 CHRON  
 Reviving a Tortilla Tradition  
 By Janet Fletcher 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; NAPA, Calif. _ &LR;  For Americans accustomed to storebought,
preservative-laden corn tortillas, a fresh tortilla made with
just-ground corn is a taste revelation.
<P>
   That's why Rick Bayless, the noted restaurateur and Mexican food
authority, insisted on serving only fresh tortillas when 400 people
gathered for a Mexican food conference at the Culinary Institute of
America at Greystone last month. Bayless agreed to be conference
chair only when the CIA agreed to grind the corn and make the
tortillas on the St. Helena premises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The light goes on in people's eyes when they taste a fresh
corn tortilla,'' says Bayless, who operates Frontera Grill and
Topolobampo in Chicago. ``It is the very heart of Mexican life. If
I have one crusade in my life, it is the crusade for fresh masa.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh masa _ the soft, buff-colored dough used for tortillas _
took center stage at the conference, an educational gathering for
food professionals. But as attendees learned, the sweet-smelling
fresh masa from ground  &LR; mixtamal &LR;  (partially-cooked dried corn) is
losing ground at the Mexican table. Few modern Mexican women have
time to soak dried corn and take it to the mill as they used to.
Instead, tortilla production, both at home and in factories,
increasingly relies on an inferior dough made with the dehydrated,
flourlike masa known as masa harina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corn tortillas made with (masa harina) may look the same, but
they don't taste of anything and they're not as soft,'' says Diana
Kennedy, renowned Mexican food authority and conference keynote
speaker. Kennedy blamed Maseca, the country's largest producer of
dehydrated masa, for accelerating the disappearance of dried corn
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   With Maseca, a cook just adds water. In contrast, dried corn
must be treated with lye to soften the skin, partially cooked,
steeped for several hours, then well-rinsed before it is milled or
ground by hand on a basalt  &LR; metate &LR;  (grinding stone). As she has
done countless times for her large family and her customers at
Tlamanalli, her restaurant in rural Oaxaca, Abigail Mendoza Ruiz
got down on her knees at the conference, picked up a stone rolling
pin, and painstakingly crushed mixtamal into masa on her sloped
metate. To make tortillas this way for her family can take three
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that Mexican women eventually embraced the mills
that sprung up in the early 20th century. Distrustful at first that
a machine could do the work of their muscular shoulders and
forearms, most women finally relegated their metates to special
occasion use. While the industrialization of tortilla-making has
liberated Mexican women, it has also threatened to drive out the
real thing _ the seductively corn-scented, mixtamal-based,
preservative-free fresh tortilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cheating the Mexican public of their rightful diet,''
Kennedy says.
</P>
<P>
   To produce the nearly 7,000 fresh corn tortillas that attendees
ate over 21/2 days, conference organizers turned to San Leandro's
Mi Rancho Tortilla Factory, which set up a commercial stone grinder
on the school grounds. A dozen Napa Valley Latina women were
pressed into service to knead, shape, press and bake the mountains
of soft, fresh masa.
</P>
<P>
   Lined up behind gas-fired griddles, with square wooden presses
that many had brought from Mexico, the women worked as smoothly as
ballroom dancers who no longer have to think about the steps. As
they chatted and laughed, their hands scooped up balls of masa,
shaped them into rounds, pressed them into perfect circles, and
then, with a graceful sweep of the arm, laid them across the hot
griddle. With bare fingers, they flipped the tortillas once, then
again, then prodded them with fingertips to get them to puff like
pita bread. When you can get them to puff, the women say, you're
ready for marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Yolanda Tierrafria of Napa Valley's Mi Fiesta Catering
showed a reporter how to make tortillas on a home gas stove, using
fresh masa, a hinged metal press and a metal  &LR; comal &LR;  (griddle).
Several clumsy attempts _ made more frustrating when the caterer
announced that youngsters master the technique right away _ evolved
into some modestly respectable specimens, including a few that
might qualify the maker for marriage. Tierrafria herself can make
80 to 100 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   A fresh tortilla, smelling powerfully of toasted corn, begs to
be eaten hot off the comal with an all-American swipe of butter and
salt. Mexicans are more restrained, however. The hot tortillas are
transferred to napkin-lined baskets _ not stacked inside, warns
Tierrafria, but loosely overlapping, like the petals of a flower.
At the table, they embrace taco fillings and soak up silky moles
and chile-based sauces. Day old, they're fried and topped with
shredded meat or beans, lettuce and salsa; or dipped in chile
sauce, softened in hot oil, then wrapped around cheese to make
authentic enchiladas.
</P>
<P>
   The fresh tortilla, like rice in Asia, is the unseasoned staple
that underlies Mexico's entire culinary tradition. ``It's a spoon,
it's a plate, it's a food,'' says Susana Trilling, a cooking school
owner in Oaxaca who taught at the conference. ``It really is
everything in the Mexican kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How to Make Fresh Tortillas &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   You will need fresh masa, a heavy tortilla press, a comal or
griddle and plastic wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Knead the masa to test its consistency. It should be smooth,
soft and malleable, like a very soft bread dough; when you form a
clump of masa into a ball, the dough should clean your hands. Add a
little lukewarm water if the masa is too dry. (If your tortillas
crack around the edges as they cook, your masa is too dry.) Add
water cautiously; too much water will make a sticky, tacky masa
that can't be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the comal or griddle several minutes over moderate heat.
</P>
<P>
   Cut two squares of plastic wrap large enough to overhang the
tortilla press slightly. Put one square on the bottom plate of the
press.
</P>
<P>
   Take a clump of masa about the size of a golf ball. Shape it
into a ball between your hands. Place the ball in the center of the
plastic-lined plate of the press and flatten the ball slightly with
your palm. Top with the second square of plastic, then close the
press and use the lever to gently but firmly press the masa into a
thin round. If you press too hard, the tortilla will be too thin
and impossible to get off the plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Open the press and lift off the top square of plastic. Place
your left hand (if you are right-handed) palm down over the right
half of the tortilla. Lift up on the plastic to release the
tortilla from the press, then invert your palm so that half the
tortilla is hanging off the right side of your hand. Carefully
remove the second sheet of plastic. Put your right hand, palm up,
under the hanging tortilla half. Lift up to disengage the tortilla
from your left hand. Now the tortilla is in your right hand with
the left half of it hanging.
</P>
<P>
   Standing over the hot comal, lay the tortilla on it with a
sweeping gesture. Your hand should move away from your body as you
lay the tortilla down without inverting it.
</P>
<P>
   Let the tortilla cook until the edges begin to brown, less than
one minute. With your thumb, carefully lift an edge and flip the
tortilla. If you move swiftly, you will not burn your fingers. Cook
tortilla on the second side until it is marked with brown freckles
and no longer looks moist, about 45 seconds more, then flip again.
</P>
<P>
   Firmly press the tortilla with your fingertips to encourage it
to puff, the sign of a well-made tortilla. When it puffs _ usually
within a few seconds _ the tortilla is ready. It may refuse to
puff, but don't worry; it will still be delicious. Transfer to a
napkin-lined basket, placing it puffed side down. Repeat with
remaining masa.
</P>
<P>
   As you improve your technique, you will be able to cook several
tortillas at once.
</P>
<P>
   One pound of fresh masa will make about one dozen 6-inch
tortillas.

 WINE POTPOURRI: Great Expectations for Last Harvest of Vintage  By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Never a dull moment about sums up Vintage 1999 for
most of the wine world. Even with the impact of El Ni &LR; n &LR; o and La
Ni &LR; n &LR; a, the wine-grape harvest in the Northern Hemisphere was, in
the words of Sonoma winegrower Marimar Torres, ``Late, small and
great.''
<P>
   High expectations for a quality vintage were evident early in
the year, when Southern Hemisphere vintners brought in the 1999
harvest. Australian vintners are hailing 1999 as one of their best
in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great year to finish off the decade, century and
millennium,'' says Wayne Stehbens of Katnook Estate in Coonawarra,
South Australia. Chile reports low yields, as much as 50 percent
below normal by some estimates, but ``incredible quality,'' says
Don Baker, winemaker for Vinas de la Calina. Similar reports of
excellent quality come from Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   With a late harvest just ending, California growers and
winemakers are already excited about the high quality. At the 1999
Vintage Press Conference in San Francisco, California Wine
Institute president and CEO John De Luca said, ``The effects of La
Ni &LR; n &LR; a created a long, cool growing season and a late harvest that
produced normal to lighter yields per acre.''
</P>
<P>
   How light? Estimates are running to 20 percent below average, or
between 2.5 million to 2.9 million tons of wine grapes for the
state. In contrast, 1998, a cool, wet year hit hard by El Ni &LR; n &LR; o,
recorded 2.53 million tons of wine grapes. Both vintages lagged
behind the record 2.89 million tons in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A late vintage also encourages nail biting among growers and
winemakers, who worry about frost. In most parts of the state, the
vintage was late by as much as a month, with the harvest still
under way in some parts of the South Central Coast.
</P>
<P>
   What does that mean in terms of grape quality? De Luca says,
``The longer hang time for the grapes concentrated the fruit
flavors and deepened the colors _ quality marks for an exceptional
vintage.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres also leans to superlatives like ``great'' and
``outstanding'' to describe the quality she and her winemaker, Bill
Dyer, are seeing from the 1999 Sonoma County vintage. According to
Torres, quantities of 1999 Marimar Torres Estate Pinot Noir and
Chardonnay will be small, but the quality will be outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the second largest wine producing state in the
country, some winemakers are calling 1999 the best ever. According
to the Washington Association of Wine Grape Growers, this year
marked the state's second largest harvest _ 65,000 tons _ which was
the result of exceptionally warm, dry days during fall and is
expected to result in wines of high quality.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon, usually bothered by rains at harvest, experienced warm,
dry days during harvest, turning what was expected to be a very
good vintage into one that's hoped to be exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Europe Vintage 1999
</P>
<P>
   Across Western Europe, raves for the quality of the 1999 vintage
are piling up. It's the sixth excellent vintage this decade,
especially for Italian red wines.
</P>
<P>
   Angelo Gaja, one of the leading wine producers of Piedmont in
Northern Italy, rates 1999 as excellent and the quantity of the
harvest as very good. ``The climate conditions produced superb
grapes for all the red varieties and for Nebbiolo from Barbaresco
and Barolo in particular,'' he says. The same high rating applies
to Tuscany, where Castello Banfi rates 1999 as excellent.
</P>
<P>
   In France, Vintage 1999 brought more high praise. Exceptional
weather in Beaujolais should produce ripe, fruity red wines with
great charm. After a hot spring and a cool, dry winter, winemakers
in St. Emilion are encouraged that wines from the 1999 vintage will
be similar to the very good 1998. On the left bank, in the Medoc
and Graves, chateau owners are optimistic that 1999 will produce a
good vintage.

Wine Q &AMP; A
</P>
<P>
   Chemist Arthur Dunlop of Berkeley enjoyed the Cellar Selection
description of the Australian Riesling from Jasper Hill, but was
puzzled by the label term ``natural sulfur dioxide.'' ``Is it
captured from a volcano?'' Dunlop wonders. In reality, Jasper Hill
owner and winemaker Ron Laughton was overstating the obvious, since
all sulfur dioxide is natural.
</P>
<P>
   The mail also brought a letter from Mrs. Marzolf Carmen, the
wife of a winegrower in Alsace, France. Mrs. Carmen liked our
coverage of Alsace wines in Potpourri and wants American lovers of
Alsace wines to know about her family winery in Gueberschwihr.
Consider it done.

Happy Birthday, Opus One
</P>
<P>
   Opus One, the Napa Valley red wine collaboration between the
Baroness Philippine de Rothschild of Bordeaux's Chateau
Mouton-Rothschild and Robert Mondavi of Robert Mondavi Winery in
Oakville, is 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Mondavi first conceived the idea of a partnership with the
Baroness's father, Baron Philippe de Rothschild. Today, the name
Opus One denotes quality and prestige, more so than the wine's
rumored unofficial name, ``Bob &AMP; Phil's Big Red.''

 Sushi American Style: We've fallen in love with this
Japanese  delicacy, but what we're getting is a far cry from
Tokyo.   By Robin Davis 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; ``I told you we'd have to wait,'' lamented a young
woman one night at Ebisu when she and a friend arrived just before
6 p.m. to an already packed house.
<P>
   It was typical. Customers crowd into the popular Inner Sunset
sushi restaurant night after night. The lucky ones snag seats in
the small entryway until their tables or seats at the sushi bar are
ready _ which can be an hour or more. But by 7 or 8 o'clock, twice
as many people are usually huddled outside in the fog or drizzle.
More daring patrons might grab a drink at Park Chow down the
street, but most are too fearful of losing their spot on the
waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown's Metreon, customers flock to trendy Sanraku, opting
for sushi instead of burgers and Cokes before catching a movie
upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   All around the Bay Area, sushi restaurants are filled to
capacity. And more are on the way _ every time a restaurant closes,
it seems a sushi bar rises in its place.
</P>
<P>
   Sushi's popularity doesn't end with restaurants, though.
</P>
<P>
   Construction workers, office managers and Silicon Valley techies
pack sushi in their lunch boxes. Supermarkets sell premade sushi so
customers can pick up California rolls along with their cereal and
milk. Kids look forward to ``sushi day'' in school cafeterias,
their anticipation rivaling the excitement of pizza day. And there
may come a day when baseball fans can get spicy tuna rolls along
with hot dogs during the seventh inning stretch at the Giants'
Pacific Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   Sushi has become America's new fast food. We've taken an ancient
Japanese tradition and made it all-American. We eat it because it's
easy and because it's healthful. But above all, it's quick: We can
wolf down a few pieces of  &LR; maguro &LR;  and  &LR; hamachi &LR; , some jumbo rolls,
and wash it down with beer in the same time it takes to gorge on a
burger and fries. Plus, sushi fills our never-ending quest for
something new and exotic.
</P>
<P>
   But what we're eating in this country is a far cry from the
original Japanese finger food. We've turned the delicate vinegared
rice dish into something wholly American _ big and bold. We eat it
differently and make it differently.
</P>
<P>
   Some see this as an abomination, but most sushi experts embrace
American-style sushi as a food of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Sushi was developed hundreds of years ago in Japan as a way of
preserving fish. To properly ferment the fish, it was packed in
rice, but then the rice itself was discarded. Over time, cooks
began experimenting with cooking the rice to eat with the fish.
Eventually people started eating the fish raw rather than
preserved, so cooks mixed the rice with sugar and vinegar to give
it the sharp fermented flavor they missed from the fish. The word
``sushi'' actually refers to the seasoned rice, not the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Today in Japan, sushi chefs emphasize presentation and the
importance of using a variety of fish. They design sushi platters
with a certain amount of empty space, considered aesthetically
pleasing. And with sashimi (raw fish served without rice), elements
that represent heaven, earth and movement _ such as julienned
daikon, shiso leaves or shredded carrot _ should be present on the
platter.
</P>
<P>
   But this sort of finesse gets lost in the American
interpretation. ``How they decorate is supposed to have meaning,''
says Steve Fuji, owner of Ebisu. ``But maybe 80 percent of
(American diners) don't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   American-style sushi represents what Americans like: large
servings and bold flavors. When Japanese-trained sushi chefs
started coming to this country in large numbers in the early 1970s,
they noticed the difference in the American palate, and began
creating spicy rolls, spider rolls made with fried soft-shell crab
and, of course, California rolls. Those evolved into today's
popular rainbow rolls and dragon rolls stuffed and layered with a
mixture of cooked and raw ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these rolls incorporate non-Japanese ingredients like
cream cheese, chile paste and smoked salmon _ favorite American
flavors and textures. These rolls helped sushi gain popularity with
an American audience. But their use in sushi started out of
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that we didn't have enough material available in
the United States so chefs got creative using avocado and
crabmeat,'' says Takehiko Yasuda, president of the Northern
California Japanese Restaurant Association.
</P>
<P>
   But others think that American sushi remains what it is _ jumbo
rolls with nontraditional ingredients _ because of the inferior
quality of American fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here fish is tasteless compared to Japan so sushi chefs have
to modify,'' says Hiroshi Takama, sushi chef in the Lobby Lounge of
the Ritz-Carlton San Francisco where traditional Japanese-style
sushi is served. ``In Japan, halibut is very sweet. The halibut
here tastes just like dead fish. Some chefs try to reinforce with
spice.''
</P>
<P>
   Takama refrains from this practice because he wants to offer
something distinctive to his customers. He starts with what he
calls ``the very best fish in the whole city,'' and supplements it
with ingredients like top-of-the-line caviar.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Lowe, owner of Ace Wasabi Rock 'n' Roll Sushi in the Marina
and Tokyo Go Go in the Mission, both of which cater primarily to
the twentysomething set, feels American-style sushi works as a
lead-in to true Japanese sushi. ``Customers start on the specialty
rolls, then they try the more traditional  &LR; nigiri &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, feel that the Yankee interpretation just adds
to sushi's overall appeal. To Glenn Sakata, assistant branch
manager at fish distributor International Marine Products in San
Mateo, the development of American-style sushi is part of sushi's
evolution. ``Sushi from a historical point of view has always been
changing,'' he says. ``I think this is just one of its steps. I
think it's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Differences between Japanese and American sushi extend to the
way the food itself is served and eaten. Part of the Japanese
experience is the interaction with the sushi chef. Customers pay
attention to seasonality and will leave much of the ordering to the
chef, who knows what fish is best on any given day.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, on the other hand, have become used to their
favorites.  &LR; Maguro &LR;  (tuna),  &LR; hamachi &LR;  (yellowtail) and  &LR; sake &LR; 
(salmon) have to be served all year long because they're what
Americans have come to expect.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Ebisu's Fuji, who believes the customer is
always right. In fact, if he has the ingredients he'll make
whatever the customer wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time, someone ordered chicken teriyaki  &LR; maki &LR; ,'' he
recalls. ``I made it for him. I don't know how it tasted, but it's
what he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a classically trained French chef who diverges from
tradition, Fuji feels comfortable in creating distinctly
non-Japanese sushi. But he worries about diners who eat sushi made
by untrained chefs _ which the crush of new sushi restaurants can
bring. Many chefs simply learn as they go _ not the best situation,
he says. If sushi is made by someone without experience, the fish
can be incorrectly cut, making it difficult to chew and unpleasant
to eat.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why the owners of Hama Sushi in Venice in
Southern California last year opened the first sushi school in
America to train professional sushi chefs (see related story, this
section). The school breaks the male-only tradition of Japanese
sushi chefs _ a third of the school's graduates are women, and
students come from many ethnic backgrounds. In addition, the two
three-month programs significantly shorten the old-school
apprenticeship in Japan that takes as long as eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Ebisu's Fuji also feels that sushi chefs have a certain
responsibility to educate their customers about different kinds of
seafood.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say they don't like sea urchin,'' he says. ``But I
teach them to like it.'' First he cooks the sea urchin, called
 &LR; uni &LR;  in Japanese, and serves it with a special sauce. A customer
who likes it will usually order it again. Eventually, he says, the
customer will try it raw.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he says, ``If customers have a bad taste the
first time they have sushi, they won't have it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuji and others see mass-produced sushi as providing that
negative first hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick with sushi is having quality fish that's nice and
cool and then the warm rice,'' says Ken Lowe. ``If you refrigerate
the fish and the rice (which necessity dictates with ready-made
sushi), the quality suffers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe was casually approached about doing sushi at Pac Bell Park,
but declined because he believes mass-produced sushi _ which is
what would have to be served to handle the volume _ is horrible.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Andronico, president and CEO of Andronico's Markets,
begs to differ. He reports a positive reception to the sushi sold
at his supermarkets. For three years, Andronico's has offered sushi
that's made fresh throughout the day and stored in the refrigerator
case. And its popularity shows no sign of waning _ most of the
buyers are repeat customers, Andronico says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it the best sushi? No, of course not,'' he admits. ``But
the basics that we do, we do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just supermarkets that have popularized premade sushi.
The Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey includes sushi along with luxury
items like raw oysters, caviar, shrimp and carpaccio at its lavish
Sunday brunch buffet. The sushi, which is prepared by a company in
Los Angeles and then delivered to the hotel, is consistently the
most popular item on the buffet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have 150 people at brunch, I'll go through 500 pieces of
sushi,'' says executive chef Jacques Sorci.
</P>
<P>
   As for the evolution of American sushi, Tommy Kousaka, one of
the chef/instructors at the California Sushi Academy, doesn't see
it as a problem. In fact, he thinks that one day things will go the
other way _ American-style sushi will become available in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's American sushi, and why not? You can't get spicy tuna
roll in Japan.'' He pauses and smiles, ``Yet.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; How to Eat Sushi &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How Americans actually eat sushi differs from the Japanese
technique in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   Here, most sushi eaters mix a large amount of  &LR; wasabi &LR;  _ green
Japanese horseradish _ in a small dish of soy sauce, then dip the
sushi rice-side down into the mixture. But using extra wasabi and
dipping the rice side into the mixture actually obscures the flavor
of the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Fuji, owner of Ebisu in San Francisco, explains that sushi
should be dipped fish-side down into a bowl of soy sauce with no
additional wasabi. ``The wasabi is already in the sushi and you
only need about one drop of soy sauce for each piece,'' he
explains. If you want more wasabi, tell the sushi chef.
</P>
<P>
   Most  &LR; maki &LR;  (the rolls) usually have a sauce of some kind and do
not need to be dipped into anything. The only rule is to eat each
slice in one bite, except for the very large pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the Japanese technique for eating  &LR; nigiri &LR;  sushi:
</P>
<P>
   _ Grasp the sushi between your thumb and first finger. Remember
that sushi is finger food; true sushi buffs do not use chopsticks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dip the fish side of the sushi very briefly into a small bowl
of soy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turn the sushi fish-side up, then flip the sushi into your
mouth, placing the fish side on your tongue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whenever possible, eat each piece of sushi in one bite. If the
sushi is too large, hold the remaining piece in your hand; do not
return it to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; SPEAKING SUSHI &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Here's a short list of some Japanese words commonly used in sushi
bars:
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Gari &LR; . Thinly sliced pickled ginger served as an
accompaniment to sushi and sashimi. A slice should be eaten between
consuming different kinds of fish to cleanse the palate.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Hamachi &LR; . Yellowtai
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Maguro &LR; . Tuna
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Maki &LR; . Rolled sushi, usually four to six slices per order.
The filling is rolled in rice, then in seaweed and then cut into
slices. Some maki, such as the California roll, are ``inside out,''
meaning they are rolled in seaweed first and then in rice so the
rice is on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Nigiri &LR; . Fish or shellfish pressed into an oval of sushi
rice. Most nigiri is served two pieces to an order.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Nori &LR; . Dried seaweed
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Sake &LR; . Salmon, though it also refers to the alcoholic rice
drink. The words are pronounced slightly differently, but to avoid
confusion, order your sushi from the sushi chef and beverages from
the waitress.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Sashimi &LR; . Sliced raw fish (served without rice)
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Sushi &LR; . A dish based on rice seasoned with vinegar and water.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Temaki &LR; . Hand rolls, ususally served one to an order. The
filling is rolled in a seaweed cone.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Unagi &LR; . Barbecued eel
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Uni &LR; . Sea urchin
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Wasabi &LR; . Spicy green horseradish paste used in most nigiri
sushi and served as a condiment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; American Sushi School Breaks Old Barriers &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If someone wants to become a chef, he can choose from many paths
to reach his goal: American culinary schools and colleges, European
schools, Old-World apprenticeships.
</P>
<P>
   But what about sushi chefs?
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the owners of Hama Sushi in the Southern California
beach town of Venice, opened the California Sushi Academy to fill
continued requests from restaurants for skilled sushi chefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started with the intent of opening up the art of sushi to
anyone who wanted to learn,'' says Phillip Yi, vice president of
marketing at the Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to its opening, the only way to receive training was
through the rigorous Japanese apprenticeship program, which could
take as long as eight years. Apprentices would work and frequently
live with sushi chefs, often from a very young age. The first year
was spent mopping the floor; the second year, apprentices might get
to wash the sushi rice. It was years before they actually touched
fish.
</P>
<P>
   And the apprenticeships were almost always offered exclusively
to Japanese men.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy is breaking that barrier by training women and men
from various ethnic backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The curriculum consists of two three-month programs, both
part-time. One covers basic knife skills and Japanese cooking
techniques; the other concentrates on making sushi and sashimi.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy also offers non-professional one-day sushi and
sashimi classes for those who want to learn how to make sushi at
home.
</P>
<P>
   In taking the professional classes, each student is pursuing a
dream. Brian Delaney wants to return to Atlanta to open his own
sushi bar, or at least a restaurant that incorporates sushi into
the menu. But he admits he was intimidated by Japanese food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to cook Cajun, French, lots of other foods, and I
thought, `Why not Japanese?' But I was scared of the Japanese
tradition,'' he admits.
</P>
<P>
   Christy Tomlinson, who graduated from the Academy last spring,
spent the summer in Michigan coaxing people to eat sushi at her
restaurant. Now she's back in Los Angeles going to massage school
and helping out with the one-day classes for the public. Her dream
is to open a combination spa, gym and sushi bar.
</P>
<P>
   Yi is quick to point out that, like American and European
cooking schools, the Academy lays down a foundation. Students still
need to work in sushi bars to hone their skills before they can be
considered sushi chefs.
</P>
<P>
   While the Academy opens the doors to women and non-Japanese men,
the Japanese born and trained sushi chef/instructors teach
traditional Japanese sushi making _ not shortcuts _ and barely
touch on the large  &LR; maki &LR;  rolls so popular in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm teaching 400 years of Japanese history, not just
knife skills or cooking,'' says chef/instructor Andy Matsuda. He
wants his students to learn the traditional way before they branch
out and become creative.
</P>

 &HT;    McCain eager to show foreign policy know-how at Jewish forum
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Arizona Sen. John McCain will take his turn at the
foreign policy lectern today in an effort to set himself apart from
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will talk about foreign affairs at the Republican Jewish
Coalition's candidate forum in Washington. But unlike Bush in his
foreign policy speech last month, McCain will answer questions from
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's important for members of an audience to engage
directly with a candidate,'' said Dan Schnur, a McCain spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The substance of McCain's remarks is not expected to be much
different from Bush's. Both hold an internationalist view of the
world that includes a clear-headed trading relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, a former POW in Vietnam, is eager to show his
expertise in this area and that he would come to the presidency
with no need for on-the-job training.
</P>
<P>
   He counts former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former
U.N. Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick among his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   All six GOP candidates are expected at today's forum. They will
meet Thursday night in New Hampshire in the first debate that will
include Bush.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, today's speech marks the first of five policy talks
he plans to give in December to flesh out his campaign themes of
character and reform.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy has been a focus of McCain's 13 years in the
Senate, and his aides count the subject as one in which McCain has
an advantage over Bush. The governor has stumbled over the names of
countries and world leaders, but gave a generally well-received
speech at the Reagan Library on Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   At campaign stops, McCain talks often about foreign policy,
describing a world that was dangerous and predictable when the
Soviet Union was the U.S.'s principal rival and that is now ``as
dangerous and much less predictable'' without another superpower.
</P>
<P>
   He has repeatedly criticized President Clinton for a foreign
policy that suffers from two flaws, ``strategic incoherence'' about
what the U.S. wants the world to look like and ``self-doubt'' about
how to act as the world's lone superpower.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was a critic of the American-led NATO bombing campaign in
Kosovo, complaining that the president aided Serbian leader
Slobodan Milosevic by announcing that he had ruled out the use of
ground troops in the Balkans. McCain charged that Clinton's
decision was driven by opinion polls that showed no support for
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also invoked his military experience when he said NATO
pilots were being ordered to fly high enough to avoid being shot
down, which had the effect of decreasing the accuracy of their
bombs and increasing civilian casualties on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a conscripted force. The pilots signed up for
this,'' McCain said at a recent event in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   A similar lack of resolve has characterized the administration's
dealings with Iraq, McCain has said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has squandered American credibility in Iraq, idly
threatening force on some occasions and engaging in desultory
bombing raids on others, McCain said in a March speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should never make idle threats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Russia, McCain favors suspending international loans until
Russia ends the fighting in Chechnya, where Russian forces are
accused of having committed atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   He supports building a missile defense system and would put
Israel and Taiwan under its umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also would consider covert military assistance to
dissidents in so-called rogue nations, including Iraq and North
Korea.

IT'S EASY TO COAX AMARYLLIS BULBS TO BLOOM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: Please tell me how to force amaryllis into bloom.
</P>
<P>
   A: Amaryllis bulbs are among the easiest to force into winter
blooms. The large, lilylike flowers are available in red, pink,
salmon, white, yellow and bicolors. The blooms may be single or
double, and there are miniature amaryllis, too.
</P>
<P>
   It is traditional to coax, or force, large Dutch hybrid
amaryllis into bloom for the holidays. Simply plant a bulb in a
pot, and in six to eight weeks you'll have blooms.
</P>
<P>
   African amaryllis bulbs will flower three to five weeks after
planting and have large blooms on shorter stalks that do not
require staking. Ask your nurseryman to identify the bulbs if they
are not labeled.
</P>
<P>
   To force amaryllis for winter color, select large, firm bulbs.
Bigger bulbs generate more flower stalks, therefore more blooms.
Stay away from bruised or discolored bulbs and/or those that lack
roots. Clean the bulbs by removing dried scales and any dried
roots.
</P>
<P>
   Amaryllis bulbs do not require pre-chilling but you can
refrigerate them (but do not place near vegetables or fruit) to
delay blooms or store them in a cool, dry place until potting time.
</P>
<P>
   Soak the roots and the bottom of the bulb in lukewarm water for
at least four hours before potting. Keep the upper half of the bulb
dry.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom time varies a little among varieties. Pot African
amaryllis bulbs three to five weeks before desired bloom time. For
an extended flowering period, start a new pot every few weeks for
blooms all winter and into spring.
</P>
<P>
   Use a clean clay pot with a drainage hole. Use a pot large
enough to allow an inch of space between the bulb and the inside
wall of the pot. Amaryllis bloom best when the succulent roots are
pot-bound. For more drama, pot three bulbs in a 12-inch container.
</P>
<P>
   Fill the container with a rich, well-draining potting mix. The
ideal pH range is 6.0 to 6.8. Spread the roots over a small mound
of soil in the pot, then add more potting mix and gently press the
soil to eliminate air pockets and secure the bulb. Leave the upper
third of the bulb above the soil line, which should be about an
inch down from the top of the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Water well with tepid water, and do not water again for two
weeks. Then water sparingly until the flower stalk and the foliage
are growing well.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the pot in a place where the temperature is above 68
degrees. Avoid drafts and areas where there are great swings in
temperatures. Place the pot in indirect light for the first three
weeks, then move the amaryllis into bright light.
</P>
<P>
   Stake the flower stalk of Dutch bulbs to support the large and
heavy blooms that will come. The stalks can be 2 feet tall, the
blooms as much as 8 inches across. Tie the flower stalk loosely to
the stake. Do not allow the stake to touch the petals or bulb.
Rotate the container to avoid a permanently leaning flower stalk.
</P>
<P>
   Heat initiates the amaryllis bloom, while light affects the
quality of the bloom. Bright light is good, but direct rays can
lower the quality of the flowers. Under good conditions, amaryllis
flowers retain quality for about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the flower stalk 2 inches above the neck of the bulb once
the blooms have withered, but leave the straplike foliage to grow.
</P>
<P>
   You can continue to grow the holiday amaryllis in its container
or transplant the bulb into the garden, with half of the bulb above
the soil in a fertile, well-draining bed, ideally with morning sun
and afternoon shade. Wait to leave amaryllis outdoors until April,
when there is no threat of frost.
</P>
<P>
   Some gardeners simply sink the bulb, pot and all, into a raised
bed. The roots will eventually grow into the bed. Should harsh
weather hit, the pot can be lifted and the bulb moved temporarily
to a protected area. While those roots in the garden bed will be
torn, those within the container will not be damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Amaryllis need a year to acclimate in the garden. Then the bulbs
will begin a natural spring-flowering period. Water amaryllis
regularly through spring and summer. Decrease watering when the
foliage yellows, as lower fall temperatures trigger dormancy.
</P>
<P>
   Amaryllis are known as heavy feeders, and the bulbs benefit from
organic and synthetic nutrient sources. Do not fertilize bulbs
during dormancy. Lay container plants on their sides in a cool
place during dormancy. Mulch garden bulbs. Amaryllis will come
around in spring as the soil warms.
</P>
<P>
   Amaryllis forced to flower can bring years of enjoyment as pot
plants or in the garden. But don't attempt to force the bulbs two
years in a row. They need rebuilding time. Buy new bulbs next fall.

MAKING THE MOST OF BEING SECOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For seven years we have watched Hillary Clinton
cope awkwardly, in good times and bad, under intense public
scrutiny with the undefined role of first lady.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a painful process. But if you thought that was
tough, consider the plight of the second lady, Tipper Gore. Her
public responsibilities are in some ways as complicated as those of
Clinton, although she has been so discreet and well-mannered that
she has attracted less media attention and less controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the first lady is free to do virtually whatever she
wants, a sensible vice president's wife is not free to do much of
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Because of her status, Gore is not just a homemaker whose
obligations end with her family, although she clearly puts her
husband and four children first. Now 51, she is so youthful, bubbly
and good-looking it is hard to believe that she is a grandmother.
Before a speech at the National Press Club Monday, with very little
urging she pulled pictures of her married eldest daughter Karenna's
baby out of her purse to show me.
</P>
<P>
   Out of that same purse also promptly came pictures of Tipper
skydiving this summer, demonstrating that grandmas these days can
be frisky folk.
</P>
<P>
   But because she has no power, she cannot assert herself in any
way that might upstage the Big Three _ the president and his wife
and her husband Al.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tricky business being a loyal vice president dependent
on the good will and confidence of the president. But for an
intelligent woman accustomed to participating in political life, it
can be just as dicey playing female second banana to the male
second banana.
</P>
<P>
   She isn't left much room to be useful.
</P>
<P>
   Since her husband's first race for Congress in 1976, she has
campaigned at his side and she is already involved in his
presidential bid. Political wives are expected to do that.
</P>
<P>
   She became briefly controversial in the 1980s when she led a
crusade against the then-popular porn rock to persuade the music
industry to put warning labels on records with raunchy lyrics.
Initially, she was ridiculed by those who smelled prudish
censorship, but eventually her efforts in advocating increased
parental awareness came to be seen positively as a stand for
``family values.''
</P>
<P>
   Her real public policy passion has been the defense of the
homeless and the mentally ill. These are not popular topics and
thus fit neatly into the narrow activities box traditionally
permitted vice presidential spouses.
</P>
<P>
   But she has been trying to help manic-depressives and
schizophrenics for two decades, long before Al Gore became vice
president. She also has a personal reason for her interest. She
recently disclosed that she took medication for depression after
her son narrowly survived a 1989 auto accident. Decades ago her
mother was institutionalized twice for severe depression.
</P>
<P>
   She is currently promoting a photo exhibit at the Corcoran
Gallery of Art here that encourages help for the homeless. It
includes some of her own photographs. In her speech Monday she
stressed the connection between homelessness and mental illness,
since a high proportion of those who live on the streets are unable
to cope with reality.
</P>
<P>
   National sympathy for the homeless has waxed and waned. It is
currently at a low ebb in New York City since a woman was
critically injured by a brick thrown by a homeless man. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani announced in a fury that hereafter homeless bums
will be kept from sleeping on the city streets, producing a rash of
arrests and disorderly conduct charges but no improvements in
outpatient services or subsidized housing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore tactfully disagreed with the Giuliani approach. ``I
represent a view that's very compassionate,'' she said. ``I don't
think it's a crime to be homeless on the streets of America. I
think it's a crisis that needs to be addressed with compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not mention that tough guy Giuliani is preparing to run
against Hillary Clinton for a New York Senate seat. But Gore made
no effort to put some distance between herself and the first lady,
as her husband is trying to do with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore defended Mrs. Clinton, saying that she is ``proud of
the way she's significantly used her role as first lady'' and
predicting she will help Al Gore's presidential prospects because
she's ``a terrific candidate'' who can strengthen the Democratic
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore's image as a nice person has thus far been
untarnished by the political attacks on her husband and the
Clintons. Perhaps it is that she has been underestimated, her job
as an unpaid volunteer in the Gore camp viewed as insignificant.
Perhaps it is that she is so genuinely decent and well-liked that
it is difficult to work up any complaints about her. Perhaps it is
that her husband's rivals fear generating a backlash if they pick
on a smart, family-oriented woman who is warm, kind, engaging and
not wooden at all.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps her turn is coming later, when everybody gets bored
picking on the others.

AMERICANS LONG AGO SURRENDERED THE OTHER WINSTON CHURCHILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a recent and unexpected literary discussion off the court
after a lively tennis match, I was able to set things right for my
doubles partner. She had assumed that a series of novels by Winston
Churchill on a local library shelf were the handiwork of the late,
great British statesman.
</P>
<P>
   I thought, my, how the mighty have fallen!
</P>
<P>
   Not the lionized prime minister, but the American namesake only
four years his senior. Yes, there were two Winston Churchills. They
were distant relatives, and the American one was famous earlier,
and very famous indeed. Yet no one reads him today, and, truth to
tell, no one should. But if there's confusion among the readership
of these books pages, I can help some more.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Churchill _ the American one, born and raised in St.
Louis _ was the champion seller of fiction in the first decade of
the century about to end. It was exactly 100 years ago, in the
autumn of 1899, that he broke through with his first bestseller,
``Richard Carvel,'' a romance of the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   In the early months of 1900, ``Richard Carvel'' dislodged
another historical saga _ Mary Johnston's ``To Have and to Hold'' _
as No. 1 on the then-newly-devised bestseller chart. Before the
year was over, he was back with another novel that swamped all
competition commercially. This was ``The Crisis,'' set before,
during and immediately after the Civil War, and featuring
descendants of Richard Carvel.
</P>
<P>
   This Winston Churchill (1871-1947) was squarely in the narrative
tradition of Walter Scott and James Fenimore Cooper. He continued
to spreadeagle the field with ``The Crossing'' (1904), ``Conistan''
(1906) and ``Mr. Crewe's Career'' (1908). He was inordinately fond
of the alphabet's third letter, which appears somewhat less
prominently in ``The Inside of the Cup'' (1913) and ``A Far
Country'' (1915).
</P>
<P>
   By then he was in his 40s and sales were dropping. After his
early start, it wasn't a matter of his burning out young. Literary
fashions were changing and would be altered more drastically after
the first world war. Churchill seems to have sensed the times had
passed him by; he wrote no more fiction after 1917, and his last
three decades encompassed an ever-deeper immersion into
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   A brief report on ``The Crisis'' may explain its population and
give fair indication of what regaled readers of novels at the
century's long-ago turn. Anyone familiar with Herman Wouk's ``The
Winds of War'' and ``War and Remembrance'' can have a keen notion
of how Churchill's ``Crisis'' works.
</P>
<P>
   In the Wouk saga, protagonist Pug Henry keeps bumping into the
historical household names of World War II, including President
Franklin Roosevelt, who calls him by his first name. Stephen Brice
is Churchill's hero, and during the novel's design from 1857 to
1865, he rubs shoulders and chats with such luminaries as Ulysses
Grant (not yet 40 and a has-been), William Sherman and many others,
among them Abraham Lincoln, met first as a failed candidate for the
Illinois Senate and later as a president whose assassination closes
the novel.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill scores best in ``The Crisis'' in his portrayal of St.
Louis as a hotbox of Northern and Southern sympathies before and
during the war. And the Romeo-Juliet device is recycled: Stephen
Brice is an abolitionist; the Virginia Carvel who is his unrequited
love is pro-slavery (that's why it's unrequited). There's a
romantic triangle of sorts, for Virginia is betrothed to her cousin
Clarence Colfax, her fellow Southerner who emerges a fairly decent
chap, but a stick-figure like Stephen.
</P>
<P>
   The author was lauded in his time for narrative sweep. You're
free to investigate. I'm told the novels stay on library shelves
and are seldom checked out.

 &HT;    Ramseys file suit against tabloid for publishing 'vicious,
outrageous lies'
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ JonBenet Ramsey's parents Tuesday sued the tabloid
Star, saying it libeled and defamed their son by alleging he was
the prime suspect in his sister's slaying.
</P>
<P>
   John and Patsy Ramsey filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court
in Atlanta. They seek $5 million in actual damages and $20 million
in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Star published false and defamatory stories about Burke on May
25 and June 1, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   In its May 25 issue, Star reported it had a ``World Exclusive''
and, in a front-page headline, said evidence showed that ``JonBenet
was killed by brother Burke.'' The June 1 article said prosecutors
were ``closing in'' on Burke and described him as having a ``sad,
twisted life.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke, who was 9 at the time of his sister's slaying, had
nothing to do with the killing and has been cleared as a suspect by
the Boulder County, Colo., District Attorney's Office, the lawsuit
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statements published by the Star were vicious, outrageous
lies,'' the Ramsey's lawyer, Lin Wood, said. ``Star magazine used,
and I would submit, abused a child for profit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys, Wood added, are prepared to give pre-trial
testimony and ``answer any question on relevant issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old JonBenet was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26,
1996, in the basement of the Ramsey's home in Boulder, Colo. A
Colorado grand jury investigating JonBenet's death did not indict
anyone before adjourning in October.
</P>
<P>
   On June 22, Star retracted its stories about Burke, saying he
had been cleared and was not a suspect. ``We were wrong,'' the
retraction said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Star and its parent company, American Media Inc.,
said they will vigorously defend the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Star said it feels obligated ``to conduct a complete
investigation of the murder, pursuing avenues of inquiry that were
not available to state investigators. Almost three years after this
horrible tragedy, the fundamental question remains this: Who killed
JonBenet Ramsey? Star intends to answer that question through this
litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid said it hoped ``the Ramsey family joins us now in
the search for the killer of their daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood strongly criticized Star's intentions. ``If they feel
they're going to use this litigation, through discovery, to write
more stories, they're mistaken,'' he said. ``I don't think any
federal judge in Atlanta will tolerate that misuse of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues in the Ramsey's libel suit are straightforward, the
Atlanta lawyer said. ``Where the statements false? Clearly they
were. Were they defamatory? Of course. They branded this child a
murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke, now 12, lives in Atlanta in the Ramsey home across from
the private Lovett School, which he attends.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Ramseys said they do not allow Burke to enter
grocery or convenience stores that sell tabloids. Despite the
publicity, John Ramsey said, Burke is ``doing very well. He's
turning into a normal teenager.''

`EMPIRES OF THE SAND': ROMANTIC NOTIONS OF MIDEAST HISTORY
CHALLENGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What might be called the Lawrence of Arabia vision of Middle
Eastern politics has long dominated the Western view of a major
part of Arab history. In that vision, the dashing and eloquent
British army officer T.E. Lawrence persuaded the Hashemite princes
of Arabia to rise up in a great rebellion against their Ottoman
Turkish rulers and to create a new Arab nation. But after the
Ottoman Empire was destroyed in World War I, the nationalist
Pan-Arab dream was betrayed by British and French imperialism, and
it is in that betrayal that many of the persistent problems of the
Middle East have their origins.
</P>
<P>
   This is decidedly not the view of Efraim Karsh and Inari Karsh,
Middle East historians in Britain, whose new book, ``Empires of the
Sand,'' is a readable, scholarly re-examination of a long and
complicated Middle Eastern history. The Karshes' book tells the
saga of the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, beginning with
Napoleon's expedition to Egypt in 1797 and ending with the creation
of new Middle Eastern states out of the former Ottoman Asian
possessions. In this sense the Karshes, a married couple, provide
useful historical backgrounds to the emergence of independent
countries in Egypt, Greece, the Balkans and former Danube
principalities like Serbia and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   But the main purpose of this very detailed and broad-shouldered
history is to revise many of the standard interpretations that have
been given to Middle Eastern history over the last two centuries.
Most generally, the Karshes dispute the idea that the main events
and developments in the region stemmed from the machinations of the
great powers, especially Britain and France. The ``main impetus
behind regional developments,'' they write, was ``the local
actors.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of history in this book, most of it diplomatic
history, with other factors like social conditions, trade relations
and military maneuverings introduced only in cursory fashion. This
makes for a dry account at times, one that covers the diplomatic
goings-on in more detail than many readers will want.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the authors write clearly and authoritatively and with
great geographical sweep. They provide crisp and informed accounts
of the main events involving the Ottomans and the rest of the
world. These include the almost accidental British acquisition of
Egypt, the virtually pointless Crimean War and the genocide
committed by the Turks against the Armenians during World War I (a
remorselessly efficient action that the Karshes believe, contrary
to persistent and continuing Turkish contentions, had no rationale
or justification).
</P>
<P>
   They also cover the early stirrings of Zionism in the Middle
East and, most important in this history, the complicated story of
the Arabs, the French and the British during World War I and
immediately after. Those who do not know very much of these events
will learn a great deal from this book, while specialists with
views differing from the Karshes' will face a robust challenge to
their interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent vision of the Middle East stresses the romantic
notion of Islamic or Arab solidarity against interfering,
imperialist outsiders. In the Karshes' nearly opposite vision,
local rulers constantly allied themselves with those very outsiders
to maneuver against their local Islamic or Arab rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The first few chapters of ``Empires of the Sand'' are a history
of the Ottoman manipulation of ``infidel Europe'' to suppress local
Muslim challengers to Turkish rule, a policy that enabled the
fabled ``sick man of Europe'' to remain intact as an empire long
after its strength had ebbed. In the Karshes' interpretation, for
example, the Ottomans were the major, if generally unacknowledged,
victors of the Crimean War, fought by Britain, France and Turkey
against Russia. ``It was the Ottomans who had triggered a war they
could not afford, only to harness the great powers to their
cause,'' they conclude.
</P>
<P>
   More important for contemporary politics is the Karshes' take on
the notion, central to Arab history, that a ``great Arab revolt''
was among the main events in the Middle East during World War I.
The Karshes contend that there was no great Arab revolt, no great
Arab movement for freedom or national liberation. In addition, the
authors contend that there was no great Arab cultural awakening
behind the nonexistent great revolt. This revisionist view sharply
differs from standard histories, which see the emergence of a group
of nationalist writers during the first third of the 20th century
as marking the beginnings of Arab nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   The central figures in the Karshes' account of World War I in
the Middle East are the sharif of Mecca, Hussein ibn Ali of the
Hashemite family, and his three sons, Ali, Abdullah and Faisal.
From a base in Mecca, the Hussein clan expanded its power to what
would eventually be Jordan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   In this retelling of the story, which continued more recently in
the career of King Hussein of Jordan, the great-grandson of Hussein
ibn Ali, the revolt against Ottoman rule was motivated by the
imperialist desire of Hussein ibn Ali to replace the Turks in a
new, multinational empire, not an Arab or a Muslim one. The
majority of Arabs, the Karshes write, remained loyal to the
Ottomans and did not support the Hashemite cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as the `Arab Nation' did not look to Hussein as their
would-be savior, so the sharif was interested not in the
`liberation' of his `Arab brethren' from the Ottoman yoke but
rather in the establishment of his own kingdom,'' the Karshes
write. The imperialist powers, notably Britain, did not so much
manipulate the Hashemite rulers into serving European interests as
get drawn into Hussein's scheme by the wily sharif's skillful
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   This interesting view is less romantic than the one purveyed in
David Lean's classic film ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and in numerous
other books, the view in which a passionate Arab nationalism is
first stimulated and then betrayed by perfidious Britain. The
historical reality, the Karshes say, gives a less heroic role to
the Arabs themselves but a more central one, too, since it presents
them, rather than the outside powers, as mainly responsible for
their fate.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Servic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When you sit down at Solera, the Midtown Spanish
restaurant, a little bowl of green olives appears on the table. I
find that this prompts a Pavlovian response. Olive and brine means
manzanilla, the featherlight, bone-dry sherry that may be the
finest aperitif wine known to humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, I asked for the manzanilla and then, slipping
into an old habit, simply continued drinking sherry throughout the
meal. With a plate of serrano ham, sliced chorizo and sweet and hot
salchichon, I moved to a slightly more substantial but still
light-bodied fino. With a main course of braised rabbit, I had a
medium-weight amontillado, with just enough heft and depth to match
the richness of the dish. With dessert, a warm chocolate hazelnut
cake with figs and apricots, I ordered a viscous, raisiny dessert
sherry. And at the end of the meal, I wondered, Why don't more
American diners do the same?
</P>
<P>
   Sherry is one of the greatest of all misunderstood wines.
Actually, the case is worse than that. Most diners pay so little
attention to it that misunderstanding would represent a rise in
status for this most unfortunate beverage. On paper, sherry has
everything going for it. The lighter, dry sherries make superior
aperitifs, bracing and invigorating. As complements to seafood they
cannot be equaled, especially when matched with the assertive
tidbits that adorn the tapas bar. Garlic, vinegar, spice and pepper
_ these are all friends to the finos and manzanillas. The weightier
amontillados and olorosos, at their best, achieve the complexity of
fine Bordeaux or Burgundies, and the best dessert sherries can
equal the best ports and Madeiras.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Image, to begin with. For generations, Americans have associated
sherry with a musty bottle in their grandmother's kitchen. I still
remember a visit that my then-fiancee paid to the house of elderly
neighbors to announce our wedding. We entered what can only be
called a parlor. The dear old souls, wanting to celebrate the
moment, went toward a walnut cabinet, pulled out a decanter and
began pouring a murky brownish liquid into delicate little crystal
glasses. That's the image. Anyone who can get past the image then
confronts the complexities of sherry itself. For some reason,
diners who can master the Bordeaux classification of 1855 or who
revel in the arcana of single-malt distilleries balk at sherry. The
subject seems complex. It isn't. Sherry is a peculiar product, for
a couple of reasons, but it is not terribly hard to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Sherries come in two broad types, fino and oloroso. Both are
made from the same grape, the utterly undistinguished palomino
fino, which makes a flaccid, forgettable wine that the French
sometimes call a three-man wine, because it takes two men to hold
down a third to make him drink it.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, when the wine is first put into barrels, no one
knows what form it will take. Some wines develop a thick, cheesy
yeast known as flor, which keeps oxygen out and ensures that the
developing sherry will remain light and crisp. These are the finos.
When flor fails to appear, the wine is destined to oxidize and turn
into a rich, full-bodied olo-roso.
</P>
<P>
   Manzanillas, the lightest of all, are fino-style sherries
produced in Sanlucar de Barrameda, at the Spanish seaside, where
they pick up a distinct whiff of salt and brine. Finos, when aged,
become amontillados.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Dawes, an American writer on sherry, says that a fino is
to an amontillado as a Chablis is to a Meursault. Same grape,
different weight and character.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card in the sherry family is palo cortado, which starts
to develop flor, then changes its mind and backtracks, winding up
somewhere between an amontillado and an oloroso. The name, which
means ``broken stick,'' refers to the chalk mark that the cellar
master inscribes on the barrel to indicate its development.
</P>
<P>
   All sherries, in their natural state, are completely dry, and
all are fortified, which is to say that at a certain point, alcohol
is added to halt fermentation. All have a distinctive nutty taste.
One maker has compared fino to almond, amontillado to hazelnut and
oloroso to walnut. In Spain, sherries are appreciated dry, but for
the foreign market, a sweet wine called Pedro Ximenez, or P.X. for
short, is added to amontillados and most olorosos. Cream sherry,
developed by English merchants to compete with port, is an oloroso
with P.X. added.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry is traditionally served in a copita, a small aperitif
glass that looks a little like a champagne flute cut down to half
size. It has the benefit of concentrating the aroma of a delicate
manzanilla or fino and sending it straight toward the nostrils.
</P>
<P>
   Most people do not have copitas, but one way to approximate the
glass is to fill a champagne flute halfway. Richer amontillados and
all olorosos can be served, like port, in wider glasses. Finos and
manzanillas are served very cold. Olorosos are always served at
room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   There are two schools of thought on the proper temperature for a
palo cortado or an amontillado. One prefers cellar temperature or
cooler, while the other believes that serving the wines at room
temperature opens them up. My rule of thumb is to drop the
temperature according to the richness of the wine.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Learning the sherry basics is one thing; finding the wines is
another.
</P>
<P>
   Because Americans, by and large, do not drink sherry, and tend
to regard it as a dessert wine, the pickings tend to be slim. Most
wine stores carry two or three sherries, and if they have a fino,
it tends to be from a bigger brand name like Tio Pepe or La Ina.
Some of the better stores like Crossroads and Sherry-Lehmann offer
more, but even they devote scant shelf space to sherry, whose
neglect seems all the more mysterious given its price. Most cost
$10 to $20, a third the price of wines of comparable quality.
</P>
<P>
   There are some restaurants, however, that make their sherry
lists a point of pride. Some go a step further, matching their
sherries to their menus.
</P>
<P>
   Solera, whose name means sherry cellar, does both. It serves 15
sherries, covering all the styles, including the ethereal, lemony
La Gitana (``The Gypsy Woman''); a manzanilla from Hidalgo; and a
strong lineup of sherries from Emilio Lustau, a company that has
become synonymous with high-quality, small-producer sherries.
</P>
<P>
   In a practice I strongly approve of, the restaurant's menu
suggests pairings like a palo cortado with seared foie gras and
Catalan spinach in an oyster-mushroom and port sauce. Piquillo
peppers stuffed with braised oxtail and cauliflower puree go
beautifully with the startlingly deep Los Arcos amontillado from
Lustau, and the restaurant proposes a pale cream sherry to go with
sauteed quail with white grapes and a moscatel wine sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Solera organized a series of menus to highlight the
sherry-food possibilities. One meal began with an Andalusian
consomme with meatballs, egg and mint. The sherry was La Ina, a
fino. Quail eggs over mushroom puree with shaved truffle took a
single-cask palo cortado from Lustau, whose very finest sherries
are labeled with the term almacenista, a reference to tiny
producers who, in the past, would either sell their product to
blenders or save them for family and friends. A dish of prawns and
Moroccan spices was paired with a manzanilla, and confit of duck
with white beans and raisins took an oloroso. For dessert, the
restaurant poured an intensely sweet glass of pure Pedro Ximenez
wine.
</P>
<P>
   The pan-Latin trend has been good to sherry. It would be hard to
find a better list than the one at Bolivar, nearly 25 sherries that
include the snappy fino from Valdespino, a single-cask palo cortado
and oloroso from Lustau, and Sandeman's lush, velvety Royal
Corregidor oloroso. Robert Guarino, the manager of Bolivar, also
keeps a few special bottles on hand that he will open for
interested customers, like Osborne's astounding Solera India
oloroso, a complex, rich wine with overtones of orange peel, fig,
brown sugar and gingerbread.
</P>
<P>
   Patria carries nearly 15 sherries, including an old amontillado
from Hidalgo and two almacenista olorosos from Lustau: 1918 Dona
Pilar Aranda y Latorre, and the dry oloroso of the purist,
Emperatriz Eugenia. Jorge Liloy, Patria's wine director, likes to
pair a manzanilla with crispy oysters and fufu, spinach and
huacatay sauce, made from an Ecuadorean mint. The Hidalgo
amontillado goes with a black lobster empanada with yellow tomato
and saffron aji, and Liloy proposes a fino to go with sweet pea
crepes filled with bacalao and yuca. Other restaurants with
respectable lists are N, Marichu, Meigas and Xunta.
</P>
<P>
   Some chefs outside the Latin culinary borders have also picked
up on sherry. Sherry is a natural with most Japanese foods, so it
is only slightly surprising that March, with its Japanese
affinities, should feature sherry. In part this is because Joseph
Scalice, an owner and the wine director of March, took a trip to
Jerez, Spain, the town whose name the English rendered as
``sherry,'' and underwent something like a religious conversion.
March has eight dry sherries and eight dessert sherries, including
a Solera BC200 oloroso from Osborne, which the restaurant pairs
with its confit of duck foie gras, done Indian style with garam
masala, a papadum and sweet chutney. Manzanilla goes perfectly with
sashimi slices of hamachi with olive oil and white soy sauce, and
the grand Solera India oloroso is the suggested pairing for panna
cotta with bittersweet almond cream.
</P>
<P>
   I like to see sherry used this way, pushed outside its normal
boundaries. But the drink has a natural drift that brings it back
to the tapas bar. It is too alcoholic to quaff like wine (although
Julian Jeffs, the English writer on sherry, claims that it is
difficult to drink less than a bottle of manzanilla on a hot day),
but perfect for sipping a little at a time, which makes it ideal
for small bites.
</P>
<P>
   I recently sat down at Marichu to taste my way through a phalanx
of sherries. The chef, Teresa Barrenechea, sized up the situation
and brought one sherry-friendly appetizer after another: fried eels
in garlic, marinated anchovies in a slick of olive oil, sizzling
shrimp in garlic and pepper, piquillo peppers stuffed with bacalao,
and squid in ink sauce. It was a selection that allowed me to work
from manzanilla to fino to amontillado. And at the end, she put a
plate of Spanish cheeses on the table to show off the olorosos.
</P>
<P>
   I could have ordered wine, of course. But at the time, I
couldn't think of one reason why.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Periods of rain and snow will develop Wednesday over eastern New
England as a broad area of low pressure strengthens to the east of
Cape Cod. Bands of snow will sweep inland, crossing much of Rhode
Island, eastern Connecticut and southeast Massachusetts. On Cape
Cod, the snow will mix with rain as warm air from the ocean moves
overhead. Farther north and west, snow showers will develop over
interior sections of New England on the fringes of the storm.
Strong, gusty winds will accompany the precipitation, bringing
frigid wind chills and blowing snow.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, following a very cold morning, the interior Middle
Atlantic states will once again be rather chilly Wednesday as
breezes from the north continue to usher cold air into the region.
It should be sunnier than it has been, however, as sinking air
currents under a region of high pressure crush any cumulus clouds
that form. The Southeast will also be much cooler as some of the
cold air moves across the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   A weak front sweeping over the northern Plains will bring some
chillier air and cloudy skies to the region. Farther south, the
central Plains will have one more day of unseasonably mild weather
before noticeably colder air slides across the prairie Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, yet another low-pressure system will approach
coastal Washington and Oregon, bringing showers and periods of
rain. Farther inland, snow showers will develop from the Wasatch
through the Tetons and into the Bitterroots. Meanwhile, the
Southwest will begin to turn more seasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Private Snowstorm
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Cape Cod had a private snowstorm early Tuesday. While
partly sunny skies covered much of New England, windswept snow
accumulated a few inches in a short time near Chatham, Mass. Cold
winds from the north garnered moisture as they passed over the long
stretch of the relatively mild waters east of New England. The
narrow, roiling bands of clouds that formed were responsible for
heavy snow. A similar process leads to the renowned ``lake-effect''
snows near Buffalo, N.Y. Today, a large ocean storm will bring
widespread snow in extreme eastern New England.

STATE, LOCAL POLICE GET HIGH-TECH GUN TRACING TOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new computer program unveiled Tuesday by the
federal government should help state and local law enforcement
authorities quickly trace guns used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The program, called Online LEAD, has been operating on a trial
basis since February and helped local law enforcement officials and
the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
(ATF) to trace guns used in crimes in New York, Washington, Boston
and Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville Police Chief Emmett Turner, who participated in the
pilot program, said the system allowed his department to trace a
gun used in the 1996 murder of Nashville police officer Francis
Scurry. The gun was tracked back to two people who illegally sold
the weapon along with 400 other firearms. They were arrested and
convicted for violations of federal firearms' laws.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the online program will
allow federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to
``quickly bring together data, disseminate it quickly and see
patterns where we haven't before.''
</P>
<P>
   The software taps into an existing ATF database that contains
information about hundreds of thousands of guns sold by federally
licensed gun dealers. The database includes the make, serial number
and manufacturer of the guns and information about where they were
sold and who bought them.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, that information was stored on computer discs in
Washington that had to be shipped out to local ATF field offices, a
process that sometimes took several days. ATF officials explained
that in many cases guns used in crimes are often purchased only a
few days ahead of time _ information that will now be captured and
readily made available by the new online program.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this week the software will be made available to state
and local police through the ATF's 331 local field offices. The
database is continuously updated and can be instantly downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more quickly we can follow up on leads the more likely we
are to solve the crime,'' said ATF director John W. Magaw.
</P>
<P>
   The system is also designed to track down gun traffickers as was
done in the Nashville case. ATF officials also cited a case in
Boston where police recovered six handguns from various crime
scenes around the city. They discovered that the guns were all
purchased from various gun shops in Mississippi. This discovery
eventually lead them to Jose Andrade _ a Jackson State University
originally from the Boston area _ who used other students to
purchase guns for him at area pawn shops. Andrade then illegally
sold the guns to Boston gang members when he was home on school
breaks. Andrade is currently in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will help us prevent crime by allowing us to focus on
sources of gun crimes and shut them down,'' Magaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said he hoped the new program would help police more
quickly find and arrest illegal gun traffickers and result in fewer
guns on the streets and fewer violent deaths. He noted that the
murder rate has fallen by five percent each year for the past five
years while violent crime has dropped 35 percent in the past eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But 42,000 Americans are still killed each year by firearms,''
he said.

EYES COVERED BUT SEEING, A NOVELIST LOOKS INWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (js) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURPHYSBORO, Ill. _ One thing to know about Kent Haruf, author
of the novel ``Plainsong,'' is that he wrote the first draft of the
book with a wool stocking cap pulled down over his eyes. He would
sit typing blindly in the unheated basement of his unpretentious
white frame house in this sleepy town trying to visualize the high,
dry Colorado plains of his childhood. He would try to imagine two
little boys whose mother leaves them because she is so depressed
and a half-Indian girl who is pregnant and has nowhere to go.
Written in sparse, clean language, ``Plainsong'' is a novel about
kindness and how it comes in unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   Haruf had never written a novel with a wool stocking cap over
his head before. But his rather eccentric method was, he said, an
effort to reach the emotional heart of his story unconstrained by
the feeling that someone _ an invisible critic _ was watching over
his shoulder and scrutinizing every word he chose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying not to be analytical, to get in touch with the
intuitive, the visual, the spontaneous, without any attention to
detail and syntax,'' said Haruf, whose last name rhymes with
``sheriff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes away the terror when you're blind and you can't go
back and rewrite a sentence,'' he said. ``It calls for
storytelling, not polishing.'' His method seems to have worked.
``Plainsong,'' published by Knopf, has gone into six printings
since its publication in October. It was nominated for a National
Book Award and has received almost universally positive reviews.
``He has conjured up an entire community and ineluctably immersed
the reader in its dramas,'' Michiko Kakutani wrote in The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Giles wrote in Newsweek, ``Watch for fireworks over the
plains.''
</P>
<P>
   Success has come on the late side to Haruf, who is 56. His work
has always been praised by critics. He won a Whiting Writers' Award
as well as a PEN/Hemingway Foundation special citation for his
first book, ``The Tie That Binds,'' published in 1984. But that
novel and his second, ``Where You Once Belonged,'' in 1991, did not
sell very well, and they came hard. He had three small daughters to
support, and he held jobs teaching high school and as a farm
laborer and construction worker. As a consequence Haruf, who has
the unremarkable looks and plain manner of a small-town insurance
salesman, is modest in his consideration of his new found praise
and cautious about the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're nuts, crazy in this country about fame,'' he said in his
soft voice. ``We expect writers to be something between Hollywood
starlet and a village idiot. In both cases, they're supposed to
perform antics on demand. I think it would be most dangerous for a
writer to be famous. It's very distracting. Mailer wrote his best
stuff before he became famous.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that Haruf will move away from Murphysboro any
time soon. The town is so quiet that the only sound besides Haruf's
voice as he speaks in his living room is the gentle tinkle of a
wind chime. And the only thing that seems to move in the general
stillness are the leaves falling from the hardwood trees onto the
deserted backyards.
</P>
<P>
   Haruf teaches at the University of Southern Illinois in nearby
Carbondale, and he says he has always liked this small town
atmosphere. He knows that he gains something from it, a sense of an
enclosed, encompassable place. He tells his students that they are
lucky to come from the small towns of the Midwest. ``They feel
embarrassed, but I tell them it is a great advantage to grow up in
a distinct place with so many little towns,'' he said. ``You know
people, you know their histories, whose pickup is in front of the
bar. You may not know everything, but you get a sense of the stages
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Haruf was born in Pueblo, Colo., the son of a Methodist
minister. His father moved frequently from congregation to
congregation, and the landscape of northeastern Colorado became the
setting for Holt, the fictitious town that is Haruf's
Yoknapatawpha, where most of his work is set.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of four children and was particularly close to his
younger brother, Mark. ``We thought the ideal life would be to live
it out together, with horses,'' he said. ``That's what we had
planned to do. That situation was on my mind for 50 years.'' The
boyhood dream never materialized, but it formed the basis for the
relationship between the two little boys in ``Plainsong.'' Mark is
now a certified public accountant.
</P>
<P>
   Haruf attended Nebraska Wesleyan University in Lincoln, where he
discovered Faulkner and Hemingway. In 1965 he went to Turkey as a
Peace Corps volunteer. During the Vietnam War he was a
conscientious objector and did alternative service in a hospital
and an orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   He knew that he wanted to be a writer and applied to the Iowa
Writers Workshop, but he was rejected. The urge to go was so
powerful, however, that he moved his wife, Virginia, and their
infant daughter to Iowa City in hopes of being accepted. Eventually
he was accepted on a probationary status, he said. For his master's
thesis he wrote a novel, and hope beckoned when the first four
chapters were optioned by Harper &AMP; Row. But the final manuscript
was turned down. It seemed he might not be a writer after all.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 years he taught high school English in Colorado and
Wisconsin. He began writing another novel, working during summers
off from his teaching job. He was ``desperate to have time'' to
write, Haruf said. But ``I wanted to be an attentive father,'' he
added, and he found it hard to work in the midst of the chaos of
child rearing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 he landed a job at Nebraska Wesleyan University as an
assistant professor, which gave him more time to write. At 41 he
finally sold a short story, to the literary magazine Puerto del
Sol. He also finished a novel. That, too, was turned down by Harper
&AMP; Row. Through a former teacher of his at Iowa, John Irving, he
contacted Peter Matson, the agent, who, Irving warned, had turned
down every writer he had sent to him.
</P>
<P>
   Matson broke his pattern, took on the book and sold it to Holt,
Rinehart &AMP; Winston. ``The Tie That Binds,'' published in 1984 and
set in Colorado, is about a woman who gives up her chance for love
to take care of her domineering father. The novel is narrated by
the son of the man she loved but had forsaken for her father. Chris
Wall in The Los Angeles Times Book Review called it ``an
impressive, expertly crafted work of sensitivity and detail, absent
the hokum that usually accompanies sad tales of simple women and
their domineering fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s Haruf's daughters were nearly grown, and his
relationship with his wife was ending. He decided to attend his
30th-high school reunion in Canon City, Colo., and there he caught
sight of Cathy Dempsey, who had been in the band with him, he
playing the snare drum and she the tenor sax.
</P>
<P>
   The two had lived on the same street in Canon City where her
father was the Episcopal minister. She had gone on to marry and
have three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lightning flashed,'' said Haruf. They fell in love, and
married in 1995. Mrs. Haruf is a special-education teacher at a
high school in Carbondale.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Haruf published his second novel, ``Where You Once
Belonged,'' about a former high school football hero who through
his greed and arrogance destroys the lives of many in his hometown.
But to this day the book makes Haruf uneasy. ``In some ways I sort
of lost that book,'' he said. He had written it too fast, he said,
under pressure to finish writing by the middle of August so he
could get back to teaching. Despite his doubts, the book received
excellent reviews; it was called ``a deeply affecting novel'' in
Publishers Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kent is interesting to view in terms of American
literature in the 20th century, the two different strains of
Hemingway and Faulkner,'' said the novelist Richard Russo, who
hired him at the University of Southern Illinois in 1990. ``He has
faith in the power of simple, honest language. He believes deep
down that simple language not only suffices, but he just doesn't
like artifice.'' At the same time, Russo said, ``he has learned
from Faulkner the wisdom of knowing something very well, of being
at home there, that the more something is specific, the more it is
universal.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Plainsong'' the half-Indian girl at the center is
``somebody at the edge of society,'' Haruf said. ``Why is she so
lonely and willing to be attracted and seduced by the boy from the
next town?'' Kindness comes in the form of a high school teacher,
Maggie Jones, who rescues her, and two old men, the McPheron
brothers, who have lived together in an isolated farmhouse for 50
years and who take her in. There is also a high school teacher,
Guthrie, who is left to raise his two young boys by himself. Just
at his hour of deepest loneliness, Maggie, who teaches with him,
makes her interest in him known, and they fall in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plainsong'' was a difficult book to create, said Haruf. He
struggled hard to get the right ``sound of the novel.'' He wanted
the writing to be ``as direct and straightforward and as simple as
can be.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result the book begins almost colloquially: ``Here was this
man. Tom Guthrie in Holt standing at the back window in the kitchen
of his house smoking cigarettes and looking out over the back lot
where the sun was just coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had a lyric gift; I don't,'' Haruf said of his
writing, perhaps disingenuously. But then he couldn't help
admitting, ``I don't like gorgeous writing.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jean-Georges Vongerichten was doodling. First he made
a triangle, then several loops attached to the triangle. Then he
dotted the triangle like mad, finishing with a loose, fluid
squiggly.
</P>
<P>
   But this wasn't just any doodle. Vongerichten, the chef at Jean
Georges, was figuring out just how he wanted to present his new sea
bass dish. It needed textures that varied, flavors that harmonized
and looks that would cause audible gasps upon arrival in the dining
room.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, all the effects cooks might want for their
efforts in the kitchen. But professionals know that their efforts
can't stop there: for food to be fully appreciated, attention must
be paid to the way it is arranged on the plate and set before the
diner.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, home cooks are happy just to get the food to
the table. That changes at this time of year, though, when the
entertaining season is in full swing and the everyday habit of
serving food family-style feels like quitting the race in the
homestretch. Taking time to present food thoughtfully, even
artfully, can add another dimension to the pleasure of eating it.
</P>
<P>
   If you present a dish and the diner says, ``Wow!'' ``you're
already ahead of the game before they put a fork in it,'' said
Charlie Palmer, the chef at Aureole.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs are increasingly conscious about how they present food,
and today's restaurants can serve as advanced courses in postmodern
plate design. As with any art form, schools vary. Marcus
Samuelsson, the chef at Aquavit, creates plates that appear to be
made of vivid, thickly layered brush strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Vongerichten's spare style reflects the clean, pure flavors of
his cooking. That sea bass dish, for example. By placing the
triangle fish off-center on a plain white plate, it brought
attention to it _ just the point, when you serve a great piece of
fish and little else. The coarse salt crystals dotting the top of
the fish added texture, and the free-form curve of green sauce
surrounding the fish set it off: the plate didn't need another dash
of color, or another element to fill the open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the classic style of filling the plate symmetrically is
passe. So is the nightmarish fussiness of nouvelle cuisine. Even
the overwrought dishes with towering components and sauces that
resemble Jackson Pollack canvases are fading away.
</P>
<P>
   The fashions will continue to change, but the purpose will not:
the components of a dish need to harmonize and tempt the eye.
Underlying it all are some simple techniques that collectively have
a powerful impact on the finished dish.
</P>
<P>
   The first trick restaurants use is warming plates before placing
food on them. Food cools very quickly, and if it is placed atop a
cool plate, it can easily lose its luster before the diner even
touches it. By placing the food on warm plates, it won't
deteriorate on the way to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants have special heating units for warming them, but the
effect can be replicated at home by placing them in a 150-degree
oven (the low or warm setting) for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs also take great pains to make their food easier to eat. If
you go to a bistro, roasted chicken is likely to be served intact
or cut into small pieces and arranged in a tight pile with the leg
bone pointing upward.
</P>
<P>
   But at a finer restaurant, the bird is usually boned, and its
breast meat is sliced. Thin slices of meat are more elegant and
easier to cut. You can fan out slices on a plate and lean the legs
against another part of the dish, say a mound of celery root puree.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to think of how guests will eat the meat. You
don't want to have to destroy a tower to get at a piece. Generally,
unless you want a large piece of meat to be the feature of the
plate, meats and fish should be cut down to make them more
approachable.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most basic principles is layering. This doesn't
necessarily mean that ingredients should be stacked on top of one
another like a napoleon. They can just overlap slightly, linking
them implicitly.
</P>
<P>
   This could be done with any dish. Typically rice, pasta or
grains are used as the base, and the primary component, usually the
meat, is laid on top. If there is a vegetable, it may lean on the
meat or be tucked between the base and the meat. Sauce is spooned
over specific parts of the dish and around the border.
</P>
<P>
   The dishes at Union Pacific are great studies in layering: Rocco
DiSpirito, the chef, has made a science of it. Components are
layered directly on top of one another, and each has a distinct
textural and flavor identity.
</P>
<P>
   In his mackerel salad, a thin circle of pear and celery puree is
spooned into the center. It is the mortar for the bricks laid above
it. A crunchy salad of celery root and pear fills the middle
portion, then slices of charred mackerel, and a julienne of pear.
It is crowned with a fluff of celery leaves and Asian greens. A
celery oil vinaigrette dresses the salad layer and circles the
tower.
</P>
<P>
   It is a complex piece of architecture, not unconnected building
blocks. DiSpirito constructs the dish this way so that with each
forkful the diner gets the perfect proportion of each layer and the
dish's flavors coalesce. It also looks impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Layering can be used to make an ordinary dish look beautiful or
to incorporate elements of surprise. The frisee aux lardons at Cafe
Boulud does just that. When the dish arrives, all you see is a
rough tangle of frisee, but each bite uncovers something new: a
poached duck egg, cubes of sauteed foie gras, bacon and chicken
livers and a dark sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The salad and meats could have been mixed together in a bowl and
laid out on the plate, but this layered arrangement made the salad
much more fun to eat.
</P>
<P>
   This arrangement also solves a problem with salads. By leaving
the livers and sauce below, the salad stays fresh as long as
possible and does not wilt or turn slimy as you eat it. This is a
trick that may be applied to any salad involving multiple
components _ especially when some are warm. Rather than serving it
on the side and having guests toss it aside as a useless garnish,
you can place a tuft of it atop primary components like terrines or
sauteed fish.
</P>
<P>
   Saucing is one of the most important principles neglected by
home cooks. It is a good idea to spoon some sauce onto a dish, so
that flavors can blend. A sauce is a great decorative tool as well.
A thin stream drizzled around the border of the plate contains the
dish visually and allows the people eating it to incorporate the
sauce as they want, rubbing forkfuls through it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Texture is important, too. A variety of textures gives a dish
concealed complexity. It is rare that you will be served a dish
with a uniform texture. Consider the lamb with orzo at Park View at
the Boathouse.
</P>
<P>
   A bed of orzo is spread around the base of the plate. Kumquats
and pistachios are sprinkled over the orzo, and a braised lamb
shank is laid atop the orzo in the center of the plate. A lamb jus
is spooned over the lamb and around the orzo, providing the dish's
flavor thread.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than eating the different parts of the dish separately,
you get a little taste of each in nearly every bite. The sauce is
wet, the orzo soft, the pistachios crunchy.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients shouldn't be added carelessly. Usually you can add
texture without altering the content. Rather than steaming fish,
for instance, you can sear it to give the skin a crisp texture. Or
you can take a much more subtle approach, as Vongerichten did in
his sea bass dish, seasoning it just before serving with coarse sea
salt.
</P>
<P>
   Color has more straightforward appeal. An all-white or all-brown
dish is tough to get excited about. But it can be obvious when a
chef throws in an ingredient just to add color. It becomes a
distraction, not a complement. A monochromatic dish can be striking
in its absence of color.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Rodriguez, the chef at Bond Street, uses color
deliberately. Most of her dishes include a dark component, a light
component and a bright component. So in a sea bass dish, the fish
is seared on the skin side so that it is dark, and she pairs it
with bright bok choy and light daikon simmered in fish broth. The
flavors make sense together, and the ingredients happen to be
colorful.
</P>
<P>
   Color should be organic, not forced. Generally, if you cook with
seasonal ingredients, using a variety of meats, vegetables and
fruits, your dishes will naturally have a variety of colors. Even
if there is just one bright element, that is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Every sense should be considered in the dining experience. Many
dishes, like soups, give off a burst of aroma when they are ladled
into a hot bowl, and many restaurants have begun doing this kind of
dish-finishing at the table. At home, a simple flourish at the
table, like snipping herbs over a soup, can have the same effect.
</P>
<P>
   These are the techniques. What most diners notice are the styles
chefs use. It is important to have a point of view. A chef with one
of the most recognizable styles is Alfred Portale of Gotham Bar &AMP;
Grill. His food is almost always concentrated at the center of the
plate with ingredients tightly clustered and positioned in towers
that seem to explode upward from the plate. They are beautiful to
look at, difficult to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular style descends from classical cuisine.
Generally, the main components of a dish are placed neatly in the
center of the plate and surrounded by sauce that covers the base of
the plate. Garnishes are then arranged symmetrically around the
center component.
</P>
<P>
   Dishes presented this way can be beautiful and easy to
comprehend: you eat from the center and incorporate the surrounding
sauce as you go.
</P>
<P>
   But the central tower and symmetry are receding in favor of new
styles. Probably the most pervasive is one influenced by Japanese
cooking. Rather than symmetry, food is presented asymmetrically,
often marked by a great deal of open space.
</P>
<P>
   With Vongerichten's foie gras terrine and brioche toast, there
is more negative space than positive. A slice of truffle lies on a
half circles of terrine and toasted brioche. They are sprinkled
with fleur de sel and coarse pepper. There is nothing else on the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation is modern and stark, but not merely stylish.
Its simplicity has a way of making the dish more welcoming than
cool, complex, architectural formations.
</P>
<P>
   It is a useful technique. If you have a dish with just a few
elements, there is no reason to fill up the plate. Arranging food
plainly naturally calls attention to it: there are no other
distractions. And if the food is good, no one will be disappointed
by the spareness.
</P>
<P>
   Another Asian influence has been the use of tableware to give a
sense of variety. A plate with an interesting shape or finish can
transform something ordinary. Ceviche presented in a martini glass,
for instance, somehow feels more special than ceviche on a flat
white plate. Lobster soup in an oversize bowl feels grander. Beets
on a narrow rectangular plate do not seem a humble root.
</P>
<P>
   Tadashi Ono, the chef at Sono, and Takako Yoneyama, the chef at
Taka, both potters, design and make their own dishes to suit their
needs. Every plate at Sono is slightly different _ and memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Even without homemade pottery, though, this approach can easily
be translated in a home kitchen. All you have to do is free
yourself from the strictures of the five-piece place setting. Why
not use large pasta bowls for a fine little salad or teacups for
soup?
</P>
<P>
   More and more, chefs design dishes that invite diners to get
involved. At Bond Street, Ms. Rodriguez wraps the ends of lamb
chops in raffia to encourage picking them up. Vongerichten places
caraway crisps between mounds of crab salad and has the waiter
instruct diners to spoon it onto the crisps.
</P>
<P>
   Plating food takes practice. Even great chefs make mistakes.
Cyril Renaud, the chef at La Caravelle, wanted to present a scallop
tartare as naturally as possible, so he spooned it into a scallop
shell and rested it on a bed of cornmeal, to suggest sand. It
doesn't seem the kind of dish that requires an instruction manual,
but Renaud said that some diners tried to eat the shell and others
sprinkled the cornmeal over it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough lesson: if it looks good enough, people will want
to eat it.

NAVAL FORCE SAILS WITH EYE ON VIEQUES TARGET RANGE  
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By STEWART M. POWELL   
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With White House approval expected for limited
target practice to resume on the Puerto Rico island of Vieques, a
Navy-Marine Corps battle group sets sail beginning Wednesday for
combat preparations on the island before heading to the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of 16 warships in the armada prepared to leave Norfolk,
Va., and Charleston, S.C., on Wednesday, followed by the aircraft
carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower on Thursday and the remainder of
the fleet on Friday to begin final combat rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy is being forced to break up the components of the
training to make up for the loss of live-fire rehearsals at
Vieques. Instead, the Marines plan to stage an amphibious landing
at Camp Lejeune, N.C., while carrier-based airplanes will practice
bombing at two military ranges in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Surface warships will fire their five-inch guns using
non-explosive rounds at the target range in Vieques under an
agreement in the final stages of negotiation by the Clinton
administration and Puerto Rico officials.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Rear Adm. Craig Quigley told a briefing at the Pentagon on
Tuesday that the armada will conduct 18 days of ``complex
war-fighting scenarios'' including air-to-air combat, undersea
warfare, coordinated targeting, planning for Tomahawk cruise
missile launches and the Marine amphibious landing.
</P>
<P>
   The force includes about 15,000 sailors, aviators and Marines
aboard the aircraft carrier, two missile-firing cruisers, four
destroyers, two fast frigates, two attack submarines, three Marine
amphibious attack ships, an ammunition supply ship and an fleet
oiler.
</P>
<P>
   Amid questions on Capitol Hill over the adequacy of
pre-deployment training with the Vieques range closed, Quigley
insisted: ``We will deploy the carrier battle group and the
amphibious ready group with the training they need.''
</P>
<P>
   But privately, Navy officials said that the seven-month
stalemate with Puerto Rico over resuming use of the embattled
Vieques target range prohibits any chance of rehearsing the
round-the-clock, integrated land, sea and air attacks that
traditionally test the readiness of a departing aircraft carrier
battle group for potential combat in the Mediterranean or Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Vice Adm. William Fallon, the Atlantic fleet commander, and
Marine Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of Atlantic-based Marines,
have told Congress and a Pentagon review panel that realistic
live-fire combat training on Vieques is needed to help GIs get over
their initial jitters in order to save lives in the early stages of
combat.
</P>
<P>
   The range has been closed since April 19 when a Marine pilot
mistakenly bombed a range observation post, killing Navy contract
security guard David Sanes Rodriguez, 35, and injuring four
civilian range workers.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello are near
agreement on temporary, limited resumption of Navy-Marine Corps
training on an 899-acre live fire impact area and adjacent
11,000-acre maneuver and buffer zone, senior Clinton administration
officials reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``All parties are working very hard to find a solution as
quickly as they can,'' Quigley said, adding that some naval forces
``may utilize portions of the Puerto Rican operating area,
depending upon the outcome of current discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a warship armed with a 5-inch gun and a magazine of
up to 500 rounds needs to fire about 100 rounds to qualify for the
naval gunfire support mission, such as supporting Marines landing
ashore or staging attacks against land or sea targets. The 5-inch
gun can fire up to 20 rounds a minute over a range of up to 15
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Non-explosive inert rounds, known in Navy parlance as ``blind,
loaded and plugged,'' are filled with either sand or concrete to
simulate the weight of high explosive fragmentation shells and
fired with the same 50 pound charge of powder used to fire
explosive shells. The concussion from the cannon firing can be
heard for miles.
</P>
<P>
   Over the 16-year period ending in 1998, an average of 77
warships fired on Vieques an average of 91 days each year. Ships
fired an annual average of 6,114 rounds from 5-inch guns during
that period.

TV NOTES: `MILLIONAIRE' SUCCESS; `SOPRANOS' REDUX 
</HEADLINE>

   Cashing In On `Millionaire'  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the November sweep officially ending Wednesday night,
network program executives spent Tuesday taking stock, and talking
about game shows.
</P>
<P>
   The seismic effect of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' was
especially apparent at ABC, whose executives literally felt the
earth move when discussing the show in a conference call with
reporters. Two minor earthquakes rumbled through Los Angeles during
the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' was unquestionably the engine that drove ABC to
its first sweep-month victory in five years, lifting the network by
more than 30 percent from last November. In contrast, NBC and CBS
were down slightly and Fox down precipitously from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everything said by every network executive Tuesday
concerned ``Millionaire'' in some way. ABC Entertainment
co-chairmen Stu Bloomberg and Lloyd Braun assertively put off all
inquiries about the network's plans for the show, saying they would
make an announcement later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is expected to make ``Millionaire'' a regular part of its
schedule, showing it up to three times a week. It ran for 18
consecutive nights in November. But Braun said, ``We're still
debating a lot of different scenarios.''
</P>
<P>
   So are programmers at the other networks, who know a juggernaut
when they see one. NBC announced that it was rescheduling its most
ambitious mini-series of the season, a 10-hour fantasy epic called
``The 10th Kingdom,'' to try to get it out of the way of the
``Millionaire'' express. Instead of starting the first Sunday in
February, the show has been postponed until the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at three networks said they were developing game
shows designed to compete with ``Millionaire,'' which was adapted
from a British show. (Fox already has one on the air, ``Greed,''
which has fared passably well.)
</P>
<P>
   ABC cited another game show being developed by ``Millionaire''
executive producer Michael Davies. Neither Braun nor Bloomberg
mentioned its name, but Davies had disclosed that he had bought the
format rights to another British game show, this one called
``Mastermind,'' and was working on getting it onto the air soon.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nothing in show business right now is as valuable as a
British game show. CBS said Tuesday that it, too, had purchased
format rights to a British game called ``Winning Lines.'' This one
is even from the same producers as ``Millionaire.'' CBS Television
president Leslie Moonves said Tuesday that it would be on the air
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has produced several rehearsals of an updated version of the
1950s game show ``21.'' NBC Entertainment president Garth Ancier
said the show had promise but was not ready to become part of NBC's
schedule. He added, with obvious hope in his heart, that when
``Millionaire'' is shown more often ``it will become more
humdrum.''
</P>
<P>
   Braun called that wishful thinking, and Bloomberg dismissed it,
saying that ``Millionaire'' was a ``true cultural phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   But the coming glut of game shows is at least indirectly
intended to help exhaust the public fascination with
``Millionaire.'' One senior programmer said he planned to get as
many game shows out in front of the public as soon as possible to
wear out the phenomenal appeal of ``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves, though he agreed he was ``playing the copycat game,''
lamented the move to game shows, saying it was ``not the best
trend'' for network television.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg said that 13 of 17 ABC series had improved their
ratings during the sweep month, which he attributed to a halo
effect from ``Millionaire.'' There have been questions, however,
about whether the game show's success has truly carried over to
other ABC shows. David Poltrack, the executive vice president for
research at CBS, said there was ``minimal trickle-down effect''
from the show and that within a half-hour after it ended most of
its big audience was gone.
</P>
<P>
   But depending on how often ABC adds the show to its regular
schedule, it may not need quite as many new series as it once did.
Braun noted that ABC is adjusting its development philosophy
because of what it expects to get from the ``Millionaire''
franchise. ``It enables us both to fill holes and enhance
development,'' Braun said.
</P>
<P>
   Encore for `Sopranos' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of what is likely to be a surge of interest in
the start of the second season of ``The Sopranos'' in January, HBO
announced Tuesday that it would pre-empt a large portion of its
prime-time schedule for a week next month to run a marathon of the
first 13 episodes of the series.
</P>
<P>
   HBO executives said they had never before cleared out so much of
their schedule for an entire week, nor had they devoted so much
program time in one week to a single show. But HBO has never had a
show with a following like the one that ``The Sopranos'' built last
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Dec. 26, HBO will rerun two episodes of ``The
Sopranos'' back to back every night at 10 and 11 Eastern time for
five consecutive nights, through Dec. 30. On Sunday night, Jan. 2,
the network will run the final three episodes back to back starting
at 9.
</P>
<P>
   All of this will begin what HBO executives called a huge
publicity push to lead up to the 13 episodes of the second season,
which is to begin Sunday, Jan. 16.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which is shot on location mainly in New York and New
Jersey, is wrapping up production in the next two weeks.

</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY-CENTER (Washington) _ The Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts, once thought of as the imperial heart of culture
in an acultural town, has transformed itself into a palace of the
people. The chairman, James A. Johnson, a Minnesotan with pedigree
credentials in the Democratic Party, is unabashed about his
populist bent. He takes pride in describing the dramatic increase
in the number of performances at the center: more than 3,000
compared with half that number more than five years ago. By Jane
Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   THOMAS-ADES-MUSIC (Undated) _ Thomas Ades, the English composing
phenom (still under 30) is really something, and the records keep
coming. The fourth and latest Ades disc from EMI Classics brings
``Asyla,'' the 23-minute orchestral tetrad that has just won its
young composer Louisville University's Grawemeyer Award, the
biggest plum the classical-music world now offers. Is all the
shouting merited? Yes indeed. If the attention being paid Ades, 28,
is another sign of the times in classical music, there is reason,
at this time of millennial stock-taking and auguries of doom, for
renewed hope. By Richard Taruskin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DELHOMME-CINEMATOGRAPHER (Paris) _ ``Being a cinematographer is,
in many ways, like being a psychoanalyst,'' said Benoit Delhomme
recently at his studio here on the outskirts of the city. ``We let
the director of a film talk, and then, from just a few key words,
we guess what's in his head and come up with the images that he
seeks.'' Delhomme, 38, who is one of France's leading
cinematographers and one of the few whose work is sought outside
his homeland, has fashioned the lighting, camerawork and imagery of
some of the most distinctive directors working today. By Laura
Winters.
</P>
<P>
   CRADLE-WILL-ROCKS-FILM (Undated) _ Tim Robbins, who has taken on
politically charged subjects in his previous films ``Dead Man
Walking'' and ``Bob Roberts,'' brings Marc Blitzstein's 1930s
musical play back to life in his new movie, ``Cradle Will Rock,''
opening on Friday. Not simply a cinematic rendering of Blitzstein's
play, or the story of its premiere, the film is a panoramic view of
New York in the Depression years, filled with such historical
characters as Nelson Rockefeller, Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo,
William Randolph Hearst, Margherita Sarfatti (Mussolini's former
mistress who wrote pro-Fascist stories for Hearst) and the young
Orson Welles, a fireball of theatrical energy. By David Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   SPANISH-FILMS (New York) _ This month, the Film Society of
Lincoln Center, in collaboration with the Instituto Cervantes,
which supports Spanish culture abroad, the Spanish Society of
Authors and Publishers and the Spanish Ministry of Education and
Culture, will present 18 independent films, most of them American
premieres, from Friday through December 24 at the Walter Reade
Theater. By Valerie Gladstone.

<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ROUSSEVE-DANCE (New York) _ By now David Rousseve is a familiar
face at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. But when he returns this
week, to present his third commissioned piece in seven years, he
will show a side he has never revealed before. Long accustomed to
working with black female vocalists, Rousseve has turned for the
first time to classical music _ and not just any classical music.
He punctuates the new piece, a collage of dance and theater called
``Love Songs,'' with the enigmatic strains of Wagner, whose
famously heroic scores and anti-Semitic sentiments made him an
emblem of German nationalism. By Christopher Reardon. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHANTICLEER-CHORUS (Undated) _ Organizations, like human beings,
go through periods of transition. Chanticleer, the San
Francisco-based male vocal ensemble, has weathered its share of
changes in recent years. ``Chanticleer is definitely at a
crossroads,'' said Lynn Luckow, its chairman of the board. ``The
question is, how do you build on past successes to ensure future
significance?'' The 12-voice chorus, named for the rooster in
Chaucer's ``Nun's Priest's Tale'' whose singing was ``swich a
joye,'' will perform three concerts of Christmas music in New York
this week. By Sarah Bryan Miller.
</P>
<P>
   MENOTTI-MUSIC (Undated) _ At 88, Gian Carlo Menotti claims to
tire more easily than of old and apologizes for memory lapses, but
his enjoyment of life remains as evident as his recall, and he
tells stories charmingly. This jesting reminiscence complements
better-known accounts of the genesis of ``Amahl and the Night
Visitors,'' the most popular not only of his operas but probably of
all operas. As the Italian-born composer-director-librettist told
the tale in an essay for the original-cast recording, he had
accepted a commission to write a Christmas opera for the National
Broadcasting Company. The opera's world premiere was on Dec. 24,
1951, the first written for television and based on the ``Adoration
of the Magi.'' By Matthew Gurewitsch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SINGER-SONGWRITERS (Undated) _ What does it mean when artists
who are strongly identified as singer-songwriters record entire
albums of other people's songs? Two recent releases, ``In Spite of
Ourselves'' by John Prine (Oh Boy) and ``I'll Take Care of You'' by
Mark Lanegan (Subpop), raise that question from contrasting, but
equally intriguing vantages. By Anthony DeCurtis.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MET-SCROLL-PAINTING (New York) _ The Metropolitan Museum has
heard it many times in the past two years, after one of its most
highly touted recent acquisitions, the Chinese scroll painting
titled ``Riverbank,'' attributed to the 10th-century artist Dong
Yuan, was accused of being a 20th-century forgery. The word is
likely to crackle in the air like static at the Met next Saturday,
when the painting _ a towering depiction of a mountainous landscape
being swept by a violent storm _ gets its day in court at an
international symposium titled ``Issues of Authenticity in Chinese
Painting.'' Leading the prosecution will be the art historian James
Cahill, who contends that ``Riverbank'' dates from the 1950s and is
the work of the Chinese artist, collector and forger extraordinaire
Zhang Daqian (1899-1983). By Holland Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   GOLD-RUSH-TREASURE (Undated) _ A Gold-Rush treasure, burnished
by 130 years in the icy depths of the Atlantic, has finally reached
its destination _ New York. Mined, sifted, assayed or minted in
California, the three tons of gold bars, ingots, coins and dust was
shipped on Aug. 20, 1857 from San Francisco bound for New York but
not even a small portion of it ever made it until a year ago. By
Rita Reif. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   MORIYAMA-PHOTOGS (New York) _ Daido Moriyama is the photographer
of the season in New York. With three exhibitions this fall _ at
Japan Society, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Laurence
Miller Gallery _ and a handsome catalog on his life and work (from
the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and DAP), has garnered more
scholarly devotion than any Japanese photographer has ever enjoyed
in this country. At the age of sixty-one, he is finally a star,
albeit a dark one. Given Moriyama's acknowledged debts to American
artists, especially to the harsh, confrontational graphic style of
William Klein and the rancid, pop sensibility of Andy Warhol, this
belated recognition is as instructive as it is overdue. By Richard
B. Woodward.

 &HT;    Fire in the mountains exhilarating, frightening
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Dec. 2.
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCCAYSVILLE, Ga. _ As forest fires raged through thousands of
acres in North Georgia recently, many of us carried on the
tradition of intentionally and carefully burning brush, trees and
stumps to improve our own private ridges, hollows and hills.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is inescapable. One day I am setting fire to piles of
briars, twigs, little tree sections. A few days later, while
fishing for bream with friend Charles Abernathy, I am watching a
shiny, red helicopter swoop down repeatedly over the placid lake,
dip out huge bucketsful of water and whirr off into the blue sky to
help douse flames.
</P>
<P>
   Fire had been on my mind for months, as I had begun a long-term
transformation of the long, steep slope down to Fightingtown Creek,
a slope featuring The Rock, which is some 20 feet across _ and, I
am discovering, many smaller rocks that crop out of the ridge.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plan, I want to expose as many of those rocks as
possible. To do that, I need to get rid of the myriad suckering
sourwood stumps, briar thickets, oak saplings, scraggly pines,
replacing them with plants such as beautyberry, hearts-a-bustin',
Christmas ferns, sweet shrub. These, along with the already present
holly, ferns, dogwood, wild rhododendron and laurel, ginger,
rattlesnake plantain, will make fine understory plants to the big
old trees left standing.
</P>
<P>
   In October, I took my first whack at this monumental task,
pruning, sawing, pulling and chopping enough unwanted growth to
make four manageable piles. As many of my mountain friends know, it
makes a lot more sense to burn this stuff in place than to try
hauling it off the aerobic slope.
</P>
<P>
   So, I lit up a pile, and after it was safely burned out, I lit
the next. Until all piles were gone. My first burn.
</P>
<P>
   Not since I was a child in Meridian, Miss., and East St. Louis,
Ill., had I done any outdoor burning. Then, it was leaves (which
now get composted), their roasting fragrance a melding dictated by
the trees providing the leaves _ in much the same way a combination
of grapes creates a wine altogether different from any of its
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Well, this burn on the ridge was not my childhood leaf-roasting;
this was alternately scary, educational, mesmerizing and,
ultimately, satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Before the flames and smoke, I did not notice how many breezes
flitted around that ridge, how the prevailing ones seemed to come
off the creek, dashing ominously toward the cabin, freezing me in
place, rake and water hose at the ready, eyes following any errant
embers, lest they head for the roof or a nearby patch of dry
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   How dry this burning can make your insides, even though you seem
not to sweat. Afterward, I drank six glasses of water and still had
muscle cramps. I'll never burn again without drinking water nearby.
</P>
<P>
   It is all too easy to forget to drink amid the power and fury of
even a small controlled fire. Seeing and feeling the flames and
heat dance and snake around the ridge, I got a sense of what the
big fires must be like.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Evans knows firsthand; the U.S. Forest Service's Conasauga
River coordinator for the Cherokee and Chattahoochee National
Forests has fought and seen his share of conflagrations. I talked
with him after my burn _ the day before he joined the battle
against November fires in Fannin, Gilmer, Union and Lumpkin
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who is based in Blue Ridge and advises property owners on
how to burn safely, noted that my frisky fire was typical. ``Fire
runs uphill,'' he said, ``and it gathers speed faster than people
realize.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, especially noteworthy in the shrub-rich mountains, ``On a
warm, sunny day, laurel burns almost like gasoline'' because of its
oily leaves. Be wary of laurel too close to your house, Evans
advises, also urging burners to keep the hose handy and primed,
have a rake and shovel at the ready to control fire and, if
necessary, dig dirt to help extinguish it.
</P>
<P>
   Too, he warns against floppy, flammable clothing, noting that,
``Unfortunately, every year somebody trips and falls into a fire,
wearing fuzzy slippers and a fleece bathrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid precautions, including watching out for ground-dwelling
birds and other wildlife, Evans, like other foresters, hails fire
(during plants' dormant season) for renewing the land, as burning
can open space, admit light, release nitrogen and yield diversity
of small, tender plants like lady-slipper and orchid: ``You get a
floral response.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what I'm looking for as I slash and burn plant
trash on the slope of rocks.

 &HT;    North Georgian's rosy courtship can't be nipped in bud by freeze
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Dec. 2.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   DALTON, Ga. _ Sam Pullen puts on his jacket, turns up the
collar, grabs his snippers and braves the brisk wind of a
late-autumn morning to launch his daily ritual.
</P>
<P>
   True gardeners seem to find a way to grow plants under almost
any conditions, at any time of year.
</P>
<P>
   But roses? In late November? We're not talking a few confused
strays that pop during a warm fall. Sam and his wife, Allene,
produce dozens of long-stem beauties, which he shares with women
all over this carpet capital every day in nursing homes, banks,
real estate offices, his fitness center, even the Waffle House _
each in exchange for a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``When frost hits, I just turn the water on them to wash it off,
and they'll last until the first freeze,'' says the retired
insurance man.
</P>
<P>
   During peak season in June, Sam has picked as many as 30 dozen
in one day from up to 750 hybrid tea and floribunda bushes covering
two large beds in his yard. He averages 10 dozen a day in summer
and as late as last week managed to fill two buckets with several
dozen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you pick them, the more they bloom,'' Sam says, ``It
takes a lot out of the rosebush if you don't cut them often.''
</P>
<P>
   His is a hobby that started nearly 20 years ago with a couple
dozen bushes, which he added to year after year.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, after having two-thirds of his larynx removed
because of throat cancer, Sam reduced his plots to some 450 bushes,
and Allene took over much of the work. ``It wasn't too bad because
we don't grow them for the bushes,'' she says. ``We grow them for
their long stems'' _ and the joy that comes from watching the faces
of strangers glow when Sam hands them a rose.
</P>
<P>
   He's now fully recovered but, because of a tracheotomy, speaks
in a whisper, a factor that also catches rose recipients off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Occasionally, some women will refuse to take them because they
think you're looking for a donation or a handout,'' he says. What
he asks is ``for a little sugar,'' and nine out of 10 oblige. ``I
don't always get it,'' Sam says, ``but at least I've never been
slapped.''
</P>
<P>
   His day starts with two hours of debudding (removing one bud for
every two to make room for bigger, tighter blooms) while cutting
the 12- to 15-inch stems of partially opened buds. He immediately
places the stems, cut diagonally just above the node of the last
cut, in a bucket of water in preparation for his run. Sam uses no
gloves, yet his hands show no battle scars from thorns.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the notorious maintenance, which includes watering
an inch per week and applying pesticides and fungicides every seven
to 10 days and a systemic fertilizer every six to eight weeks.
``They're definitely high maintenance, but if you plant them in
morning sun, in well-drained soil, they're not a big problem,''
Allene says.
</P>
<P>
   Sam loads several buckets of his multicolored roses _ the pink
variety ``perfume delight'' is his pick because his mother grew
them _ into the back of his Chrysler Town and Country van and heads
out on his route.
</P>
<P>
   First stop is the Waffle House off I-75 where Sam takes his
bounty booth to booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little old ladies here love him,'' says waitress Tracy
Griffin. ``He just likes to brighten their day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam's M.O. is to hand over a long-stem beauty and after the
woman accepts, point to his cheek, asking for his trademark
``sugar.'' When she agrees, Sam turns quickly so that his payment
gets planted right on the kisser.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're tricky,'' says Tiffany Ruble, getting her morning rose
at the Bradley Wellness Center. ``But you did bring my favorite
color.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of others get theirs, too, and with his bucket near
empty, Sam heads back into the cold to head home.
</P>
<P>
   As a chill blankets the North Georgia mountains, his thoughts
turn to preparing his rosebushes for their short winter's nap _
covering them with pine bark mulch until spring returns.
</P>
<P>
   But don't think the downtime will stop Sam from spreading his
little version of sunshine. In winter, he simply gives out tiny
stick-on roses.
</P>
<P>
   The message, if not the gift, is just the same.
</P>
<P>
   Tucking roses into bed before winter
</P>
<P>
   To discourage growth and encourage full dormancy once winter
arrives, All-American Rose Selections, an organization of
commercial garden rose growers and introducers, recommends you:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Stop fertilizing six weeks before the first frost.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Allow seedpods to develop instead of clipping spent flowers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Water plants well throughout autumn.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mound mulch around the base of the bush to help prevent
repeated freezing and thawing, which can damage roots and even
canes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Place potted roses in open cardboard boxes or other containers
and move them into an unheated building, such as a garage or shed.
Insulate the container with straw, shredded newspaper or Styrofoam
packing material to protect against temperature changes.

   Dear Regis:
</P>
<P>
   I am a big fan of your show, ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, it drove me crazy when a contestant wasted a lifeline
to answer a question a relatively intelligent beagle would know,
such as: In its solid form, water is called ... A) Silly Putty B)
Jabba the Hut C) the theme song from ``Love Story'' D) ice.
</P>
<P>
   What is wrong with these people, Regis? Does that goofy
background music set up some sort of harmonic vibration in their
brain that causes them to forget the things they learned in first
grade? Or maybe they're just dazzled by your suits. Pretty snazzy,
Reeg, I must say. Much better than those loud sport coats you wear
on Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee, the ones that make you look like you just
stepped off a used-car lot.
</P>
<P>
   While we're on the subject, what is it with Kathie Lee, anyway?
Is she the loudest, most obnoxious woman in the world, or what? You
must have a lot of self-control, that's all I can say.
</P>
<P>
   Where was I? Oh, yeah. Your new show. We watch it every night,
even if Dilbert is on another station. It's about the only thing we
do together as a family, which is sort of pathetic, in one sense,
but I prefer to think of it as a reflection of the excellent
quality of your show.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say what it is about ``Who Wants To Be a
Millionaire'' that I find so fascinating. One thing that intrigues
me is the qualification test, where the 10 contestant hopefuls try
to put four things in chronological order faster than their
competitors. Like, list the four Spice Girls in descending order of
their first appearance in People magazine. Regis, it would take me
10 minutes just to come up with the names of the Spice Girls (Baby
Spice always eludes me), yet one of the contestants always manages
to answer the question correctly in something like 3.72 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   What I want to know, Regis, is how someone can solve a problem
like this in 3.72 seconds _ a problem that most Americans would
need several weeks to work on and still get wrong _ and yet have to
burn two lifelines in order to be reasonably confident in saying
that broccoli is a vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, the lifelines are a great idea, Reeg, because
without them some contestants would have a tough time walking away
with $500, let alone $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   I have some questions about the call-a-friend lifeline, though.
For one thing, how do you define the word ``friend?'' Is it a
strict definition, like someone who stood beside you at your
wedding? Or is it a loose definition, like maybe someone you
``know'' through watching TV or reading a magazine? If it's the
less-strict definition, then why do the contestants so often wind
up calling a friend who, if anything, is stupider than the
contestant?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, if I were going to give you a list of ``friends,'' I'd
have names on it like Henry Kissinger, Marilyn vos Savant, Stephen
Hawking, that crowd. I wouldn't be giving you the names of the guys
I go bowling with every Thursday night, that's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Also, how do you ensure that these invisible ``friends'' don't
cheat, say, by leafing through the Almanac or maybe conferring with
a few hundred thousand of their nearest and dearest friends via a
computer chat room? My guess is you've got some burly AT&AMP;T thugs
working for you, guys who are paid to keep an eye on the so-called
``friends'' and make sure no funny business occurs.
</P>
<P>
   It all boils down to credibility, doesn't it, Reeg?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Reeg (it is OK if I call you Reeg, isn't it?), I just
wanted to tell you how much I enjoy your show. Who knows? I might
even apply to be a contestant if I can just learn to list Martha
Stewart's four favorite glue-gun projects in ascending order of
difficulty in under 3.7 seconds.

STUDY SHOWS RISE IN NUMBER OF WOMEN JAILED FOR DRUGS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Minn.)   By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new national study shows a remarkable surge in the number of
women incarcerated for drug offenses: an 888 percent jump between
1986 and 1996, in comparison with a rise of 129 percent for nondrug
offenses, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York state, almost the entire increase in the number of
women sentenced to prison was a result of drug offenses, according
to the study, results of which were released early last month.
</P>
<P>
   The study, a 26-page booklet titled ``Gender and Justice: Women,
Drugs and Sentencing Policy,'' was researched and written by the
Sentencing Project, a national nonprofit organization that promotes
sentencing reform and conducts research on criminal justice issues.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, the number of women in prison has increased at
nearly double the rate for men. Minority women, especially blacks
in New York State, are disproportionately affected by drug arrests
and imprisonment, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more men in prison for drug offenses than women,''
said Marc Mauer, assistant director of the Sentencing Project and
co-author of the report. ``But of the women in prison, they are
more likely to be incarcerated for drug offenses than the men in
prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the women in prison for drug offenses in three states singled
out by the study _ New York, California and Minnesota _ researchers
found substantial variation. Those states were chosen because of
geographical differences, varying sentencing structures, and good
data.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, nearly all _ 91 percent _ of the increase in women
sentenced to prison from 1986 to 1995 was in connection with drug
offenses. In California, drug offenses represented 55 percent of
the increase; in Minnesota, 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of the women sentenced to prison for drug offenses in the three
states, many were members of minority groups _ 91 percent in New
York, 54 percent in California and 27 percent in Minnesota _
numbers substantially greater than the minority proportion of each
state's population.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the justice system on Hispanic women varied from
state to state. In New York, in 1995, Hispanic women constituted 44
percent of the women imprisoned for drug offenses, but only 14
percent of the state's population. In California Hispanic women
represented 25 percent of imprisoned drug offenders and 31 percent
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   New York State officials said they could neither confirm nor
contradict the findings because they had not had time to study the
report. ``But what I can say,'' said Caroline Quartararo,
spokeswoman for the governor's criminal justice director, Katherine
N. Lapp, ``is that of the first-time felony drug offenders _ male
or female _ fewer than 10 percent received prison sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauer said there were numerous factors that snared women in the
criminal justice system: the impact of drug abuse on low-income
women; declining economic opportunities for many women; limited
treatment options and the harsh mandatory-sentence policies adopted
in conjunction with the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Mauer also theorized that a greater percentage of women than men
were incarcerated because men were often able to cut a deal with
prosecutors. ``I've heard this anecdotally,'' he said. ``The men
may not be the major drug dealer, so they can cooperate with
prosecutors by giving them the name of the major dealer. The women
may know only their boyfriend as a dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauer said the solution for the high rate of women's
incarceration for drug offenses was drug rehabilitation treatment.
``I think there are studies that show a dollar of treatment is more
effective than a dollar spent in incarceration,'' he said.

BRADLEY RARELY TAKES MIDDLE-ROAD APPROACH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ There was a Bill Bradley moment a few weeks
ago when saying nothing said it all.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential candidate was surrounded by hundreds
of civic activists in the capital of Iowa, a state crucial to his
quest. They were taking part in a downtown walk that raised money
to find a cure for breast cancer, a disease that once attacked
Bradley's wife, author-professor Ernestine Schlant &UR;  &LR; Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The chatter, echoing off office building walls, was about
politics, weather, cancer and family life. But for a sustained
string of minutes, Bradley talked to no one and met no one's
glance. He shuffled along, a head taller than almost anyone else,
lost temporarily in one of the things a campaigner usually hates:
silence.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley is not the usual campaigner. He is not a natural
gladhander. He doesn't do much prancing down the middle of the
road. Most important to his campaign hopes, he is not Vice
President Al Gore. Bradley's canny maximizing of his position as
the ``not Gore'' option in the Democratic primary has made him the
surprise of the political season.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore served together in the Senate and grew up, as
the only sons of prominent families, with the dream of becoming
president.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Gore, Bradley has not served at the right hand of the
current and controversial president, Bill Clinton. That
automatically makes Bradley the candidate of change within the
political party of the president, who himself made ``change'' the
buzzword of the 1992 election.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley was a loner in the Senate who split from the
Democratic ranks on a few sensitive issues, he is no moderate from
the mold of the Southerner vice president. Years after lashing
himself in print for being a timid legislator, Bradley calls for a
bigger, bolder use of the federal government to fight poverty,
health care inequities, racial injustice, the proliferation of
handguns and the influence of special interests on campaign
finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only national government can moderate or prevent the
insecurity that the transformation of the American economy has
brought to middle-class lives. Only government can balance the
clout of private power,'' he wrote in his weighty 1996 memoir,
``Time Present, Time Past.'' The former senator from New Jersey who
attended Princeton University and played professional basketball
for the New York Knicks would have a hard time avoiding the
``Northeastern liberal'' tag.
</P>
<P>
   And while Gore has gone through some recent image adjustments in
an attempt to match Bradley's surge, Bradley, 56, plods along with
an air of low-key self-assurance. Through 40 years in the public
spotlight, starting as a high school basketball star in a
Mississippi River town in his native Missouri, he has remained an
intellectual introvert. His calm and sometimes raspy speech, larded
with rhetoric about ideals and brotherhood, is refreshing to some
voters accustomed to candidates who strive for charm and flash.
Other voters just find the Bradley package boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he seems ministerial, that is because he is,'' author John
McPhee wrote in a 1965 book about Bradley's astounding college
basketball career. McPhee also stated that Bradley stood out from
players prone to flamboyance because ``he adorns nothing that he
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Words from Bradley's own pen give some explanation to why he
didn't feel an obligation to make small talk in the Des Moines
fund-raising walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not depend on the outside for recognition,'' he once
wrote. ``Some friends say I am functioning in a world that bears
little resemblance to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Bradley campaign looks more conventional every
day, with slick advertising and a fund-raising effort that leans
heavily on contributions from Wall Street financiers, law firms and
colleagues in the world of former sports stars. He has become more
of a gab-and-greet machine. Following the rules of political
engagement, he has begun to respond to Gore's criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   He even gave the press corps _ which he has described in various
writings as largely misguided _ a guided tour of his boyhood haunts
in Crystal City, Mo. But his staff declined to make him available
for an interview for this article.
</P>
<P>
   The town is the best place from which to explain Bradley's
motivation for seeking the presidency. He was the exceptionally
cerebral, exceptionally tall, only child of a father who ran the
town bank and a mother who was a whirlwind of civic activity. The
Republican couple bred their boy for success and courtliness,
providing lessons in everything from French horn and piano to
boxing and golf.
</P>
<P>
   But the idyllic picture wasn't perfect. Bradley endured ``the
frequent silences and somewhat staid moralizing of my parents,''
according to one of four books he has written. Growing up in a
small factory town, Bradley wrote, ``I felt I had something to
prove: that I could win, that I was as good as other people.''
</P>
<P>
   In solitary practice sessions, Bradley developed a precision-mad
approach to basketball as he grew to his adult height of 6 feet, 5
inches. He scrubbed oil and dead skin from his fingertips to feel
the leather ball better. A scientific test showed that while the
average person can see 47 degrees upward when focused horizontally,
Bradley could see 70 degrees upward.
</P>
<P>
   During his high school years, when he served as president of the
Missouri Association of Student Councils, he also witnessed
prejudice against blacks _ a subject that became a focus of his
later life as a basketball pro, senator and White House contender.
According to Bradley, his Little League baseball team, which
represented the ethnic mix of Crystal City, walked out of a
Missouri restaurant that had refused to serve the black members.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, in a memoir about his life on the road in the
National Basketball Association, he would write about how his
personality and his politics changed because of interaction with
black teammates such as Walt Frazier and Earl ``The Pearl'' Monroe,
whose upbringings had been more challenging than his. The result,
Bradley said, was that ``I regard authority a little more
skeptically than I once did. I am more interested in experiencing
life than analyzing it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a congressional intern in 1964, Bradley was present at the
Capitol when U.S. Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona, the Republican
Party's presidential nominee, voted against major civil rights
legislation. Bradley says that moment is what drove him away from
his family's political alignment and into the Democratic Party. It
came in the same year he won an Olympic gold medal as a member of
the U.S. basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley legend of perfectionism continued in the classrooms
and the basketball games at Princeton University. Coach Butch Van
Breda Kolff declared that Bradley was ``happiest when he can deny
himself pleasure.'' Bradley even balked at becoming a professional
athlete, saying that the money and the attention could be
corrupting.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the New York Knicks after a period of soul searching
and study at Oxford University in England as a Rhodes Scholar. He
refused commercial endorsement contracts, saying that he was
getting more offers than his black teammates.
</P>
<P>
   On a team that won two championships, Bradley became known as a
player who could outthink, if not out-hustle, the opposition; who
could ``move without the ball.'' It is one of the facets of his
sports career that has become a ready symbol for the race against
Gore, because Bradley has moved from long-shot to formidable
contender without the backing of party power brokers or a superior
campaign treasury. Instead he has presented himself as an unhurried
underdog who has reached out to gays, blacks, gun control advocates
and other key Democratic voting blocs.
</P>
<P>
   As a basketball player, Bradley was teased by his teammates for
his upright, bookish approach to life. He challenged that image
occasionally, once revealing that he had a ``pregame fantasy
ritual'' of staring at the same three attractive New York women in
the stands. Nevertheless, some of his locker room nicknames were
``senator'' and ``president.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So when Bradley retired from the hoops game, no one was
surprised that he decided to run for office. Nor was anyone shocked
that a popular sports figure with academic credentials could pull
votes in New Jersey, where he lived among suburban fans of the New
York team.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Bradley the lawmaker was the same as Bradley the
jock: enigmatic and brainy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not a bold kind of person, but somebody who would do
his job very well and was completely trustworthy _ sort of the way
he played basketball,'' said Gerald Pomper, a Rutgers University
political science professor who supported Bradley for the Senate
seat. ``He was not the guy who took the spectacular shot, but he
would work very hard at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marveling at Bradley's presidential campaign, which is based on
sweeping proposals such as a plan to extend health insurance to the
uninsured, Pomper added: ``The idea of him as a crusader is
somewhat out of character.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's Senate voting record is hard to pigeonhole, a fact
illustrated by Gore's criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   Gore recently attacked Bradley from the left, saying that
Bradley should not have voted in the Senate to fund a
Republican-backed experiment in giving government funds to parents
who send their children to private schools. Gore has also attacked
from the right, saying Bradley's health care proposal would
constitute a risky government spending spree.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley voted with most Democrats against the use of military
force against Iraq as proposed by President Bush. Bradley instead
favored continued economic sanctions against Saddam Hussein's Iraqi
government. Bradley also opposed Clinton's welfare reform package,
saying its time limits for welfare recipients were unjust.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the spectrum, Bradley was, in his own
words, President Reagan's ``strongest ally in Congress'' on closing
federal income tax loopholes as part of the Republican package to
lower tax rates. Bradley was also one of 11 Democrats in the Senate
who voted in 1986 to give $100 million to the Nicaraguan Contra
forces, a favorite Reagan cause that ultimately led to a White
House scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show his Senate votes matched Gore's about 80 percent of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   But as a candidate, Bradley has steadfastly gone farther than
Gore in proposing new laws with a traditionally Democratic,
activist government bent. He wants all handguns to be licensed and
registered as cars are, for example. His broad proposals addressing
health insurance, child care and poverty will cost $78 billion a
year by his own tally, and he says the money for them can be found
in budget surpluses. The federal government should fund campaigns
for federal office to keep special interest money out, he proposes.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley says gays should be able to serve openly in the
military, not under the restriction of the Clinton administration's
``don't ask, don't tell'' rule. In pressing harder than Gore for
campaign finance reform, Bradley has even said that special
interest groups that run political advertisements should pay for
their opponents to respond.
</P>
<P>
   As a senator, he voted against ethanol subsidies and other farm
support programs. He now supports the items as a presidential
candidate sensitive to the verdict of Iowans. It's not a flip-flop,
Bradley says, but rather a change of views, from considering the
needs of New Jersey to considering the needs of a nation.
</P>
<P>
   But in a campaign based on big ideas, Bradley has no specific
proposals to back up his idea that race relations are the deepest
problem facing the nation. He promises instead to promote unity
from the presidential bully pulpit and to appoint government chiefs
who will keep the principle at the top of their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley recently told Democrats at a political supper in Iowa:
``One of the reasons I did this (run for president) in the first
place was to try and restore confidence in the public will.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Bradley's own will to be outspoken and to reveal himself
in the contest stems from a political crucible in 1990, when he ran
for a third Senate term.
</P>
<P>
   He had already countenanced some private, national surveys to
find out if he would be an attractive presidential candidate. His
re-election to the Senate seemed a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley barely pulled out a victory against Republican
Christine Todd Whitman, who later became New Jersey governor.
Analysts said Bradley, already in a trough as an aloof incumbent,
had wounded himself by not speaking out about state tax increases
proposed by the Democratic governor, Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   The close call led to a stunning self-flagellation by Bradley.
In ``Time Present, Time Past,'' he wrote that the election results
forced him to examine his personal and political shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not waded into turbulent water by defining my views
clearly, preferring instead the comfort of ambiguity or silence,''
he said. ``Ambition had fueled a desire to please and had choked
off my leadership impulses. For much of my career I had no
authentic political voice.''
</P>
<P>
   With his image bruised, Bradley passed up the chance to run for
the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. He and his wife faced
a different kind of challenge that year when she underwent
treatment for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Short and sparkly, unaware of basketball when she met him,
Ernestine Bradley is her husband's opposite in several ways. He has
talked about the pain of being booed and spit upon when he was
making a rocky transition from college basketball to the pro
league, but he says that dealing with his wife's illness was the
biggest test he has faced. Ernestine Bradley, a naturalized U.S.
citizen born in Germany seven years before her husband, credits him
with handling many of the details of her illness _ treatment
schedules, the science of cancer _ while they both dealt with the
emotional strain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the year after Republicans took control of both
chambers of Congress, Bradley announced he would not seek another
Senate term in 1996. ``Politics is broken,'' he declared, citing
partisan gridlock and public cynicism. He flirted with the idea of
running for president in 1996 as an independent candidate against
Clinton. This has led Gore to question Bradley's Democratic Party
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is trying to use what happened next to turn the tables
on Gore. In 1997 and 1998, Bradley lectured, wrote and consulted
his way across the country. Those experiences, combined with his
basketball career, gave him outsider insights that Gore lacks, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went off to do my work with the American people,'' he
explained at a recent Iowa campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the period also gave Bradley time to develop federal
policy ideas, court potential contributors for his presidential run
and hone his political pitch in relative obscurity _ while Gore was
scarred by a campaign fund-raising scandal and Clinton endured
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   So as he courted about 30 voters in the living room of a
lawyer-supporter's artsy home in a Des Moines suburb one recent
evening, Bradley was a complex, lanky package: the outsider
candidate who has been on the inside, the man with a plan to fix
what he had declared broken four years earlier, a high-brow Huck
Finn in his talk about his riverside boyhood and black-white
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Looking into the receptive faces of physicians, teachers and
other professionals, Bradley said he was running against Gore's
``entrenched power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think we've got `the people,''' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Bradley got a look at how his rival's entrenched
interests are real people, too. In a conscious foray into Gore
territory, Bradley drove to a Democratic dinner at a union hall in
Newton, Iowa, where unions that represent workers at an appliance
manufacturing plant are backing the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen Gore supporters stood outdoors near the entrance,
holding Gore campaign signs and planning to chant slogans as
Bradley passed by. But then they got a look at how Bradley's
disarming approach to the campaign has made him the viable
challenger.
</P>
<P>
   With a sheepish grin, Bradley unfolded himself from his campaign
van, walked directly to the Gore folks and started shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you? Nice to see you,'' Bradley said. ``Now everybody
can come in and get warm.''

 &HT;    GSU gets a thrill from QB Hill
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATESBORO, Ga. _ Throughout his career, Georgia Southern
quarterback Greg Hill has impressed opponents with his speed and
quickness.
</P>
<P>
   The latest victim, Northern Arizona, was awestruck after Hill
accounted for six touchdowns in the Eagles' 72-29 victory in the
first round of the Division I-AA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is anybody who can run that option better, I'd like
to see it,'' Northern Arizona quarterback Travis Brown said. ``Talk
about a big-play guy, he could hurt you any time.''
</P>
<P>
   With Heisman Trophy candidate Joe Hamilton at Georgia Tech and
Quincy Carter at Georgia, Hill hasn't received enormous amounts of
publicity for his efforts at quarterback this season. But he is the
primary reason why Georgia Southern has returned to the I-AA
playoffs. The Eagles will host Massachusetts in the quarterfinals
Saturday at Paulson Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Hill is the leader of an option offense that has scored 42 or
more points 20 times in the past two seasons. The 72 points against
Northern Arizona was the most in postseason history for Georgia
Southern, but it wasn't even the highest total this season _ the
Eagles opened the season with a 76-0 victory over Fayetteville
State.
</P>
<P>
   Hill appears to be at the top of his game at the right time. To
end the regular season, he rushed for 219 yards and a touchdown
against Furman and 72 yards and three touchdowns against
Jacksonville State.
</P>
<P>
   For the season, he has gained 1,290 yards and scored 20 rushing
touchdowns and has hit on 60 percent of his passes for 1,362 yards
and 11 TDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, he brings a lot of big-play capability because of
his great quickness and speed,'' Georgia Southern coach Paul
Johnson said. ``I feel, the more Greg has played, the better he's
gotten, because he understands the offense so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill has benefited from the presence of one of the most prolific
ball carriers in the history of I-AA football _ sophomore fullback
Adrian Peterson. But Peterson, with his 3,547 rushing yards and 63
touchdown runs in two seasons, is aware of the main reason he and
the team have been so successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Greg. He's in control out there,'' Peterson said. ``If
teams move in close and try to key on me, Greg will make athe team
spread out. He'll find another way to hurt 'em. He takes the
pressure off me.''
</P>
<P>
   What Hill has brought to a Georgia Southern offense that has
been refined under third-year head coach Paul Johnson is a package
almost certain to produce big numbers. Hill is fast, running the
40-yard dash in 4.44 seconds, quick on his feet and and an
excellent decision-maker with the ball in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can talk all they want to about Peterson, who is a
great back, but Hill is the key in that offense,'' Furman coach
Bobby Johnson said. ``The things that guy does (are) almost
unbelievable. He can hurt you every way possible on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill recently became the first player in I-AA history to rush
and pass for more than 3,000 yards each in his career. At a slender
5 feet 11, 163-pounds, Hill still is considerably larger then he
was the year he led the Riverview High Rams of Sarasota, Fla., to
the District 8-AAAAAA and South Florida championships back in '94.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his size, and his distaste for flying, are a few
reasons he ended up in Statesboro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I led my high school team to a 13-1 record, but I weighed only
140 pounds,'' Hill said. ``I guess that 140 kept a lot of
recruiters away.''
</P>
<P>
   But The Citadel, Western Kentucky and Ohio University were more
than willing to take a chance on a slender kid who was efficient in
directing Riverview High's triple-option offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first college visit was to Georgia Southern, and I flew _
for the first time _ to Atlanta,'' Hill said. ``I had three or four
more visits lined up after that, but I found out on that first one
that I didn't care too much about flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I decided right away that it was going to be Georgia
Southern for me,'' Hill said. ``They ran an offense similiar to the
one we ran at my high school, and there was the winning tradition.
Plus, it's closer to home than the other schools that were
recruiting me. I could drive instead of fly.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Hill, a redshirt sophomore in '97, who replaced injured
starter Kenny Robinson and helped to lead the Eagles to the
Southern Conference title. With a 4-1 record as a starter that
year, Hill rushed for 896 yards and scored 14 touchdowns for the
Eagles, who finished 10-3 after a loss to Delaware in the second
round of the '97 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the most satisfying things to happen to me here
_ coming in after Kenny was injured and leading the team to that
conference title,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill since has guided the Eagles to another conference title
outright and a share of the '99 league crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an offensive lineman, you know that if you can go down
field and get a piece of a safety or move a linebacker just a
little bit, Greg is going to make a big play,'' Eagles All-American
senior guard Mark Williams said. ``He makes you want to give that
extra effort, because that's what you're going to get from him.''

TEXAS WOMAN SUES JACK-IN-THE-BOX 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Calif.) 
 
By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Texas woman has sued Jack-in-the-Box because a
bathroom door allegedly slammed on her hand last year and tore off
flesh from her fingertip.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Barrs of Houston claims in the state district court
lawsuit she filed last week that a Jack-in-the-Box employee
``peeled the amputated fingertip off of (sic) the door jam and
returned it ... so that it could later be surgically reattached.''
</P>
<P>
   The alleged mishap occurred Nov. 5, 1998, at a Jack-in-the-Box
restaurant located at 4232 Highway 6 North.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Schellhorn, spokesman for San Diego, Calif.-based
Jack-in-the-Box, said the company regrets ``the extremely
unfortunate incident'' and it will try to quickly resolve the
dispute ``to the satisfaction of both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Jack-in-the-Box has attempted to contact Barrs'
attorneys, but the company's calls were not returned. He said he
did not have information on whether there was a problem with the
door.
</P>
<P>
   Barrs' attorney, Ross Sears II, said he has no record of being
contacted by Jack-in-the-Box. He said he sent a settlement demand
letter to the company, but it never responded.
</P>
<P>
   Sears said the flesh was surgically reattached to his client's
finger, but scarring is still visible. He said his client is an
elderly woman, and she could not control the bathroom door because
it was unreasonably heavy and it shut too fast.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney declined to say how much he will seek in damages.
He said the restaurant chain has not paid for any of the medical
expenses incurred by his client.
</P>
<P>
   Sears said Barrs was exiting the bathroom when the door slammed
shut toward her and trapped her hand against the door jam. The
attorney said the restaurant may have installed a safer door after
the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Jack-in-the-Box is accused of failing to operate the door and
its hinge safely, failing to repair the problem and failing to warn
the public of possible danger.

 &HT;    Falcons' leading tackler Carter out for seasonBy Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the second season in a row, Falcons strong safety
Marty Carter will finish one tackle short of averaging 10 a game.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's season ended after 11 games Tuesday when he was placed
on injured reserve with a partially torn medial collateral ligament
in his right knee. He suffered the injury in Sunday night's 34-28
loss at Carolina. He will not need surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' leading tackler, Carter was replaced by cornerback
Derrick Gardner, who began the season on the practice squad and was
released on Oct. 20 after playing in two games. Carter had six pass
breakups, one interception and one fumble recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Carter, 29, hurts the team because of his range of
coverage. His size _ 6-foot-1, 210 pounds _ also made him critical
in run defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of dazed,'' said Carter, who hyperextended his knee
and took a helmet-to-helmet blow on the same play. ``I was in pain
but had no idea from the pain how bad it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, a LaGrange, Ga., native, is the fourth player on injured
reserve, joining rookie center Todd McClure and running backs Gary
Downs and Jamal Anderson. All four players have injuries to their
right knees.
</P>
<P>
   After adding two tackles against the Panthers, Carter ended up
with 109 for the season. He had 159 tackles in 16 games last
season, his fourth with the Bears. He has missed just three of 139
games in a nine-year career and started 129 times.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-year veteran Gerald McBurrows will start at strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-9 Falcons have two safeties in addition to free safety
Eugene Robinson, second on the team with 85 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Brown, a fourth-round pick in 1998, on Sunday got his first
two tackles as a pro, and rookie Johndale Carty has been playing
special teams but no defense. Starting cornerback Ronnie Bradford
also has experience at safety.
</P>
<P>
   Note: About 10,000 tickets remain for Sunday's home game against
the Saints (2-9). Fans are encouraged to bring an unwrapped toy for
the annual ``Toys for Tots'' campaign.

 &HT;    MATH &AMP; SCIENCE COMMISSION SPLITS ON IMPROVEMENTS
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of a national commission wrangled
inconclusively Tuesday over how to improve math and science
teaching in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours of passionate debate were triggered by ex-astronaut
John Glenn, the former Ohio senator who chairs the National
Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st
Century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that as a starting point, we should have in
mind what the objective is, what we want the level of
accomplishment to be,'' Glenn said. ``It seems to me we're flying
blind in some way, if we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig R. Barrett, president and chief executive officer of Intel
Corp. suggested that the goal should be raising the performance of
U.S. math and science students to ``number one or number two in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have standardized tests and we can compare ourselves to
other industrialized or semi-industrialized countries,'' Barrett
said. In one such comparison, American 12th graders were among the
lowest-scoring students from 41 countries in the Third
International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).
</P>
<P>
   The TIMSS tests aren't precise enough to decide which nation
ranks first or second, argued school superintendent Paul Kimmelman
of Northbrook, Ill. He suggested that the goal be ``scoring in the
top tier of all the countries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All this talk of becoming number one or two or whatever
strikes me as meaningless or worse,'' objected U.S. Rep. Rush Holt
(D-N.J.), an engineer. Improvements should be aimed at increasing
appreciation of math and science, preparing students for jobs,
encouraging innovation and equipping citizens to use scientific
methods to avoid being misled or cheated, Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is not so much to see scores on TIMSS tests rise,
but to see readership of astrology pages of the newspapers fall,''
Holt declared.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Keenan, Montana superintendent of public instruction,
endorsed Barrett's formulation, but said the commission should go
further. It should make specific recommendations on educational
methods that could help governors, schools of education, school
boards, principals and teachers reach that goal, Keenan said.
</P>
<P>
   But that could interfere in state and local decision-making,
objected Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This commission should not engage itself in trying to mandate
what states or even local school districts should do,'' Geringer
said. He said the commission should seek a consensus on the need
for improvements, but leave it up to ``states to adopt their own
alternatives to improve results.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett countered that such deference to local decision-making
helps explain the failure of a decade of efforts to improve the
performance of U.S. youngsters in science and math.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this broad mush in which education is decentralized,
it's under nobody's control, so nobody's really accountable, and
the system just lurches on,'' Barrett said. ``I would think that is
the problem the commission is trying to resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   After its debate, which followed two days of hearings, the
commission adjourned for several weeks with its disagreements
clarified, but still unresolved. Education Secretary Richard Riley
appointed the commission of eight federal officials and 25
prominent citizens in July. It has until next fall to agree on a
final report.

CELEBRATE (Phoenix) - It was envisioned as a huge public party to
ring in the new millennium, but it turns out Phoenix Celebration
2000 organizers purposely created a system to skirt the public open
meetings law, the Arizona Republic has learned. The city gave the
group $25,000 before it even incorporated as a non-profit
organization and a $500,000 loan even though it still doesn't have
its official 501(c)3 status. Now, it looks like the group will have
trouble repaying the loan before private donations have been slow
to trickle in, possibly leaving Phoenix taxpayers with the bulk of
the $1.3 million party bill. By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER. Story will move
in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TOBACCO (Phoenix) - Attorney General Janet Napolitano is warning
the maker of Winston cigarettes that it is violating the
multi-billion national tobacco settlement by distributing free
samples children could easily get their hands on. Under the
settlement, tobacco companies are supposed to verify that any
samples go only to adults. Napolitano wants to meet with R.J.
Reynolds to discuss the giveaway, but is prepared to go to court if
the cigarette maker does not abide by the agreement. By MIKE
MCCLOY. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
POLLUTION (Phoenix) - For the first time in four years, pollution
levels for carbon monoxide in the Phoenix area have violated
federal health standards, bringing on a high-pollution alert
through Wednesday morning.
</P>

   Maricopa County environmental officials said they could not

carbon monoxide under EPA rules. By MARY JO PITZL. Story will move

TV-GOODYKOONTZ (Undated) _ It would be easy to dismiss ``Ultimate
Trek: Star Trek's Greatest Moments'' as a show that appeals only to
hard-core fans of the series. But what's the point? That's true of
all ``Star Trek'' shows from the original to the ensuing knockoffs.
Trekkies love all things ``Trek''; the rest of us scratch our heads
and wonder whether a pocket protector is really a necessary fashion
accessory. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story will move in the ``E''

CASABLANCA, Morocco: government to top.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As free trade with the European Union develops, Fekkak said,
competition from European imports is likely to push some private
companies into the market in search of financing to expand and
create economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   Like others in the region, the government here has been
criticized for dragging out the process of selling off state-owned
companies, which began in 1993. After decades of foreign domination
before independence in the 1950s and 1960s, all the governments
fear being accused of permitting foreigners to gain control of
important segments of the economy. That is one reason governments
in the region have put only minority shares of many companies on
the market.
</P>
<P>
   But in late summer the government here scored a big success. It
auctioned off a license for a mobile phone company for $1.1
billion, about three times what was expected. The winning bidders,
a consortium of Europeans and Moroccans, said they expected to
invest $800 million in equipment. This was privatization at its
best. The government, in effect, gave up a piece of paper _ the
license _ in return for lots of money and, almost certainly, a huge
improvement in telephone service in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the mobile phone company is expected to be traded on
the stock exchange. (Such a company is a star of the Egyptian
market.) But one of many government regulations that frustrate
Morocco's young, aggressive financiers prohibits any company _ no
matter how strong and stable it seems _ from selling shares until
it has done business in the country for at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   In another drag on the stock market, the government this summer
introduced a capital gains tax of 10 percent, in response to
pressures from real estate brokers who said investment money that
once flowed to them was going into the stock market because of the
tax advantages. Foreign investors were exempt, but the tax was an
unsettling reminder of how terms of business can change overnight
in Morocco and other emerging markets. Early next year, the U.S.
Commerce Department plans to hold a conference in the United Arab
Emirates to encourage Middle East governments to work on
consistency in government administration and judicial procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, the procedures here are clear,'' said Bensaid, who
studied at Cornell University and received a degree in business at
the University of Nevada. ``But in practice, things are not that
clear. Once you get involved in a problem in the courts, it can go
on for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Tension with Algeria over Western Sahara, which in 1975 Morocco
claimed as an extension of its territory and where it still has
troops, remains a lingering uncertainty. But for Morocco's
financiers, the political picture brightened this summer with the
ascension to power of King Mohammed VI after the death of his
father, Hassan II, who had reigned for 38 years. Mohammed VI, 36,
has permitted the return from exile of political opponents of his
father and says he wants to reduce poverty and illiteracy.
Illiteracy is more than 40 percent, among the highest levels in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The young people giving the Casablanca Stock Exchange its spark
say that government officials, while cordial, have little training
or experience in finance. By contrast, the financiers felt an
instant rapport with the new king, they say, because of his youth
and his professed interest in bringing change to Morocco. He is
different from the men of his father's generation who have been
running the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our king,'' Bensaid said, ``is going to force those people to
let us do our work.''

 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Uri Mor, a slight, white-haired Israeli government
official stood atop a broken sewer cover inside the Church of the
Holy Sepulcher as hundreds of tourists streamed by.
</P>
<P>
   The broken cover has been hidden beneath a rickety, splintering
board for three years. No repair is ever hastily undertaken at the
holy site where tradition says Jesus died and was buried. In a
venerated house of worship that is elaborately divided, arch by
arch, among three major Christian rites and several other
denominations, no sewer cover is simply a sewer cover. It is turf.
</P>
<P>
   What hope, then, can there be for Israel to persuade the
Christians to install an emergency exit before an expected
millennial rush of pilgrims?
</P>
<P>
   If a sewer hole generates a sectarian dispute, a new door could
far more seriously upset the delicate balance of power among the
Christian denominations, whose rights in the church are minutely
defined and zealously guarded.
</P>
<P>
   Mor, who is Israel's liaison with the Christians, shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   It took four years of talks to get the Christian parties to
agree to such an exit on principle, given the safety concerns for a
sprawling church with a single 3-yard-wide door. A decision to
restore four arches took 27 years, he noted, and deliberations over
what color to paint the cupola lasted three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is another system of time inside the Holy Sepulcher,''
he said. ``We are working on seconds and they on eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel is reluctant to impose a fire exit on the church. Its
relations with the Christians have soured since it recently
authorized the construction of a mosque in Nazareth next to the
Basilica of the Annunciation. The Vatican sharply condemned Israel,
and the other Christian denominations backed the Catholics by
joining in a two-day shutdown of churches across the country. It
did not create a good climate for negotiations about the emergency
exit.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel has long feared the potential for disaster at the
Holy Sepulcher, and its concerns have increased in anticipation of
the millennium, with projected crowds of as many as 20,000 visitors
a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an urgent need for a new emergency exit to prevent a
possible catastrophe,'' Linda Menuchin, a police spokeswoman, said
last month.
</P>
<P>
   In the days of the Crusaders, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher
in the walled Old City contained 12 separate exits. Now, in the
last days of the 20th century, with 17,000 daily visitors, the
church has only one way in and out, requiring patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``O.K., guys,'' an American tour leader hollered Tuesday,
trapped in a bottleneck just inside the door. ``This is the most
crowded church I've ever seen. If you want to just skip the whole
thing and wait for us outside, fine with me. We'll tell you later
about Jesus' tomb.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last 200 years, the church has suffered an earthquake and
two fires, one of which cost 500 lives when people suffocated or
were trampled to death as they tried to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials worry especially about the Holy Fire before
Easter, as do some church leaders. During the Eastern Orthodox
ritual, the church and its courtyard are thronged with celebrants
who jostle to light their candles directly from the patriarch's
after his is miraculously ignited inside the sepulcher.
</P>
<P>
   But the churches do not consider the emergency exit with the
same urgency as Israel. Mor, showing his frustration, said, ``Some
think they'll pray to God for no disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   But George Hintlian, an Armenian historian who served for 25
years on the church's restoration committee, says increased daily
crowds pose no grave safety threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue has been blown out of proportion,'' he said. ``For
the churches, it is not an immediate need. The only truly dangerous
day is Holy Fire day, and the Greeks, Cypriots and Armenians will
not come in any greater numbers because of the millennium. The real
hazard will come if there is peace with Syria, because then the
Syrian Orthodox will multiply the attendance at Holy Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Ben Ami, Israel's internal security minister, continues
to meet with sect leaders to try to win their cooperation for the
exit. But he has said Israel will not act unilaterally. Israel
could use the police to limit the crowds in the church, but that
too would represent an impingement on the right of free access.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some trap in the situation because the government has
contradictory interests,'' Mor said. ``Obviously the government is
responsible for the safety of the people, but it also wants to
respect the will of the churches. Not just wants to, has to. It is
bound by international agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   As a kind of latter-day representative of the sultan, Mor, a
bespectacled Israeli, is responsible for overseeing the Ottoman-era
status quo agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1852, that agreement sought to mediate centuries of bitter
rivalries by formally dividing, down to the brooms, the Holy
Sepulcher and other holy places. The three patriarchates of
Jerusalem _ the Latin, the Greek and the Armenian _ were granted
principal ownership rights in the Holy Sepulcher. The Egyptian
Copts, the Syrians and the Ethiopians, whose monks live on the roof
in hovels, possess very little property and depend on the major
rites for their privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Only owners were envisioned as having the right to clean,
maintain, repair and restore, ensuring that contested areas would
fall into disrepair. And contestations have abounded.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The broken sewer cover, for instance, straddles a seam between
Armenian and communal property. The Armenians claim the sole right
to repair the sewer cover, and that right is disputed by the
others. Similarly, the cave-like Chapel of St. Nicodemus, with its
dirt floors, rock walls and dilapidated altar, has never been
restored because both the Armenians and the Syrians claim
ownership. Not only that, the archway leading into the chapel is
sustained by a wooden scaffold because the Syrians want to restore
it at a width of 71 inches and the Armenians, Greeks and the
Franciscans at 67 inches.
</P>
<P>
   In one more strange twist, two Muslim families have held the
keys to the church door since Saladin ousted the Crusaders. The
status-quo agreement acknowledges their sole right to unlock the
church, and stipulates that a single ladder will be shared by all
three rites, who will take turns laying it against the portal so
the Muslims can climb up to open the ancient iron lock.
</P>
<P>
   The church itself, with the contrasting styles of its many
chapels, bears fascinating testimony to the divisions within. It
stands as a kind of monument to sectarianism. Turf-conscious
animosity is palpable inside, as rival priests and monks keep an
eye on the invisible boundary lines that separate their properties.
</P>
<P>
   Closing the entrance to the Chapel of the Angel and the Tomb
Tuesday, an Orthodox priest pushed back the tourists on line.
``It's time for a procession,'' he said. ``Go to the Franciscans.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   An emergency exit would infringe on almost everyone's closely
held powers. Israel has been negotiating with the three major
Christian rites and with the two minor denominations, and the
Muslim families have sought assistance from the Palestinian
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since any innovation is considered as a breach of the status
quo, the communities are carefully studying the proposal,'' said
Metropolitan Timothy, secretary-general of the Orthodox
patriarchate. ``Nevertheless, there are many, many reservations
expressed until now for the new opening.''
</P>
<P>
   The current proposal suggests opening up a bricked-up
Crusader-era doorway that belongs to the Greeks. The exit corridor
would lead up to the roof, transecting either the Copts' or the
Ethiopians' territory, and out into the crowded marketplace beyond.
Which should it be, Copts or Ethiopians? Would the Greeks share the
key? Who decides what constitutes an emergency?
</P>
<P>
   Can the Israelis play the neutral party?
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating matters, none of the churches officially
recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Old City, which was annexed
along with the rest of East Jerusalem after the 1967 Middle East
war.

 &HT;    SEC crew who missed call suspended by officials supervisor
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The SEC officiating crew that worked the
Georgia-Georgia Tech game has been suspended by the conference. The
crew will not be allowed to work Saturday's SEC Championship Game
at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The crew, rated the SEC's best, ruled that Georgia's Jasper
Sanks fumbled at the 2-yard line in the final seconds of the game.
Television replays, however, showed that the ball popped out after
Sanks hit the ground.
</P>
<P>
   After the ball went into the hands of Georgia Tech's Chris
Young, the officials blew the ball dead. Georgia later maintained
it should have been awarded a safety because Young picked up the
ball near the 1 and then ran back into his own end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied at 48-48 when the ball was awarded to Georgia
Tech, which went on to win 51-48 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, referee Al Ford of Florence, Ala., defended the
call, saying that two of his officials had seen the ball come loose
before Sanks was down.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, Bobby Gaston, the SEC supervisor of football
officials, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the officials
had been wrong, based on his viewing of the play on television.
Gaston also received a call on Sunday from Georgia coach Jim
Donnan.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, SEC commissioner Roy Kramer said he would not comment
on the status of the officials. But Kramer was livid over the
situation and on Tuesday the conference suspended the crew from
working Saturday's title game between Florida and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the officials involved in the play also will lose
their postseason assignments. It is not known if this incident will
affect the future employment of these officials by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Ford, Saturday's officiating crew included Bud
Williams of Tallahassee, Fla.; Ron Leatherwood of Waynesville,
N.C.; Al Matthews of Duluth; Blake Parks of Murfreesboro, Tenn.;
Ben Oldham of Lexington, Ky.; and Toby Silberman of Lookout
Mountain, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Suspending officials, particularly an entire crew, is unusual.
Earlier this season, the ACC gave a one-game suspension to the crew
that worked the Clemson-N.C. State game in Raleigh on Oct. 9. In
that game, the crew incorrectly marked off the yardage on a penalty
and allowed the 25-second clock to expire without calling a
penalty.

TACKLING THE GOD QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN Francisco _ When I was 13, the neighborhood five-and-dime
store was my refuge from life. That's where the comic books were,
and the Hershey almond bars, and the magazine rack with
``forbidden'' publications like Playboy and National Enquirer. Far
more startling than Miss April or the ``Man Cut In Half to Save His
Life!'' though, was the cover of Time magazine for April 8, 1966,
which asked:
</P>
<P>
   ``Is God Dead?''
</P>
<P>
   A whole generation of baby boomers saw that magazine cover; some
of us recall exactly where we were when we first saw it. The Time
cover was pure black, save for those three chilling words and the
Time logo. God... dead?!
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I had long since abandoned belief in Santa Claus, and was
starting to disbelieve in UFOs, but God? The Creator of the
Universe, who saw every sparrow's fall, heard every prayer and
rewarded the good in heaven? The immaterial, infinite benevolence
without whom the cosmos made no sense?
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the five-and-dime with a Hershey bar in one hand and
a Superman comic in the other, I felt the earth shake beneath my
Keds.
</P>
<P>
   The Time story upset at least one fellow boomer, TV's Jay North
(of ``Dennis the Menace''). He wrote Time: ``In sending you my
views I realize I have two strikes against me: I am a teen-ager,
and I am in show business. ... This God-is-dead premise seems to me
merely a fad; religion will live through it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis'' was right.
</P>
<P>
   A third of a century later, religion is paradoxically more
powerful than ever, while the ``God is dead'' movement in theology
now seems like a dusty intellectual fad of the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the 20th century, social scientists
predicted that belief in God would decrease by the end of the
century because of the secularization of society,'' Michael Shermer
explains in this important and highly stimulating book, ``How We
Believe - The Search for God in an Age of Science.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact... the opposite has occurred. Never in history have so
many, and such a high percentage of the population, believed in
God.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Gallup poll of American adults published in the Wall Street
Journal on Jan. 30, 1996, reported that 96 percent believe in God,
90 percent believe in heaven, 79 percent in miracles, 73 percent
believe there is a hell, 72 percent believe there are angels and 65
percent believe the devil is real.''
</P>
<P>
   Which makes Shermer, an agnostic, ask: Why? In the most
``scientific'' century ever, why do both faith and superstition
flourish amid the sleek modernist vistas of urban life, with its
sky-piercing citadels to Reason and Materialism? The answers, as
Shermer shows, are less certain and more complex than you might
have guessed. And for complex philosophical reasons, by the time
you finish reading this book you might conclude that the question
``Does God exist?'' is not only unanswerable, it is unaskable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If science is the art of the soluble, religion is the art of
the insoluble. God's existence is beyond our competence as a
problem to solve,'' suggests Shermer, who teaches science,
technology and evolutionary thought at Occidental College in Los
Angeles and wrote the acclaimed ``Why People Believe Weird Things''
(1997).
</P>
<P>
   In Shermer's senior year of high school, he became a born-again
Christian; in college, he planned to major in theology. Then (he
writes) his faith was challenged by philosophical quandaries,
including the ``Problem of Free Will'' and the ``Problem of Evil.''
</P>
<P>
   To oversimplify, the former asks how humans can be ``free'' to
make choices if God is all-knowing and all-powerful; and the latter
asks why evil exists if God is all good (e.g. why didn't He stop
Hitler before the Holocaust?).
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day I have not heard an answer to the Problem of Evil
that seems satisfactory,'' Shermer says. ``As with the Problem of
Free Will, most answers involve complicated twists and turns of
logic and semantic wordplay. ... Either God allowed Nazis to kill
Jews, in which case He is not omnibenevolent, or God could not
prevent Nazis from killing Jews, in which case He is not
omnipotent.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Christians would probably respond to such heretical talk by
shrugging and saying, ``God works in mysterious ways.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, many atheists (like myself) respond by saying the
solution is obvious: God doesn't exist - or if He does, then He is
for all effective purposes irrelevant to our lives, as irrelevant
as, say, the inhabitants of another galaxy. Even Shermer observes:
``If by fiat I had to bet on whether there is a God or not, I would
bet that there is not. Indeed, I live my life as if there is no
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet billions of people do believe in God. For almost 300 pages,
Shermer discusses the evolutionary, social and intellectual roots
of faith with a clarity and depth rarely found in popular accounts
of this murky topic. Believers can enjoy his book as much as
skeptics, for he writes respectfully and knowledgeably of religion
while doubting its core precepts.
</P>
<P>
   I have two favorite chapters, including Chapter Eight (an
enthralling anthropological discussion of ``messiah myths'' around
the world, which shows Jesus wasn't alone in claiming to represent
God). Then there's the absolutely brilliant Chapter 10, an analysis
of the theological implications of Stephen Jay Gould's concept of
historical ``contingency.'' The latter notion is best explained by
a question: If the history of planet Earth were a film, and we
rewound it and played it again from the beginning, would the movie
end in the same way, namely with Homo sapiens dominating Earth?
</P>
<P>
   Again, a typical Christian response is: ``God works in
mysterious ways.'' But the hard-headed won't settle for such
answers, especially after being provoked, educated and entertained
by Shermer's excellent book.

`MILLIONAIRE' THE RIGHT ANSWER FOR ABC DURING SWEEPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the middle of a conference call Tuesday with TV writers, much
of which was spent trumpeting the success of ABC's ``Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire,''(cq no question mark) the network's top two Los
Angeles-based entertainment executives, Stu Bloomberg and Lloyd
Braun, suddenly uttered exclamations of surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having an earthquake, guys,'' Bloomberg explained.
</P>
<P>
   Now they know how the rest of the TV industry feels.
</P>
<P>
   For rival networks still reeling from the earthquake that was
``Millionaire,'' today is another day for giving thanks ... that
the November sweeps period is finally ending.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is on the verge of its first sweeps victory in five years
due almost entirely to the popularity of ``Millionaire,'' a sleeper
hit that put a glitzy face on an old format and drew an average of
24.2 million viewers while demolishing everything in its path,
including costly miniseries and specials. ``Millionaire,'' hosted
by Regis Philbin, drew twice as many viewers as the ABC sitcoms it
preempted; of 18 episodes of the quiz show, 11 of them ranked among
the top 20-rated shows for the month.
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen is how much the ratings punch of
``Millionaire'' carried over into late local newscasts. Though ABC
disputed it, analysts at other networks argued that many of the
viewers who tuned in to ``Millionaire'' did not stay with the ABC
programs that followed.
</P>
<P>
   But numbers only begin to suggest the impact of a show that
Bloomberg Tuesday called ``a cultural phenomenon'' that ``made the
water cooler a noisy and crowded place again.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it has spawned a quiz-show craze reminiscent of
the 1950s, the last time the genre had a decisive claim on prime
time.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, ABC is going to bring back ``Millionaire'' early next
year, though executives wouldn't say exactly when, but the network
is also turning to ``Millionaire'' producer Michael Davies to
develop a companion program. NBC is preparing to bring back the old
quiz show, ``21,'' Fox already has its own copycat, ``Greed,'' on
the air, and CBS is resurrecting ``The $64,000 Question'' and
developing a new quiz show called ``Winning Lines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably wouldn't be putting `Winning Lines' on my schedule
if it wasn't for `Millionaire,' '' admitted CBS Television
president Leslie Moonves. ``When you see a 15 rating ... it would
be silly not to enter the fray.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the copycatting, the success of ``Millionaire'' on a
shoestring budget upended a key assumption of network programming:
that the way to succeed during sweeps _ and deliver big ratings for
the local affiliates that use them to set future ad rates _ was to
produce hugely expensive miniseries, movies and specials. Now, the
question arises: Is it still worth it for networks to invest big
bucks in such extravaganzas when a low-cost, out-of-left-field hit
like ``Millionaire'' can obliterate the competition?
</P>
<P>
   The math certainly didn't add up for ABC's rivals in November.
</P>
<P>
   An average episode of ``Millionaire,'' excluding prizes, cost
about $400,000, a sum ABC reportedly could make back on a single
30-second commercial during the show. By contrast, ``Shake, Rattle
&AMP; Roll'' cost around $10 million and ``Leprechaun'' cost around $20
million, both of which were swamped in the ratings by
``Millionaire,'' as was a ``farewell'' special by Celine Dion on
CBS. Fearing similar damage from ``Millionaire'' during the
February sweeps, NBC West Coast president Scott Sassa said Tuesday
that part of ``The 10th Kingdom,'' a 10-hour miniseries, will be
rescheduled so part of it airs in early March, out of sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thompson, head of Syracuse University's Center for the
Study of Popular Television, said that ``with this `Millionaire'
mutation, a lot of people are going to be thinking, `Why do one of
these elaborate miniseries when you can just slap together a set'
'' for a game show. Noted Thompson: ``The biggest line item in
`Millionaire' is probably the electricity bill for all those goofy
lights.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rash, senior vice president of ad agency Campbell Mithun
Esty in Minneapolis, said the dominance of the quiz show
underscores ``the increasingly unnecessary folly of sweeps month.''
Rash predicted it will add momentum to the push for year-round
measurement of the precise demographic breakdowns of local
viewership that are now confined to sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   That would probably suit Moonves fine. He asserted Tuesday that
``Millionaire'' underscores ``why we think sweeps are a ridiculous
measurement.'' He has often argued that it's absurd for local ad
rates to be established on the basis of one-time programming
stunts.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, given the way the game is played and television's
need to generate excitement, both Moonves and NBC West Coast
president Scott Sassa and Moonves said they will continue to
develop potential blockbusters for sweeps. ``We're always going to
want big events, because we think that's what network television is
about,'' said Sassa.
</P>
<P>
   Network television is also about sitcoms and dramas, or it used
to be. But at a time when network schedules are already crowded
with newsmagazines, ``Millionaire'' and its clones will make it
even harder for dramas and sitcoms to make it onto the air. ``Every
game show that's on the air means another 100 people in Hollywood
out of work,'' remarked Moonves. ``We're going to do less pilots,
less scripts, less marginal programming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' has proven that even in an era of steady
audience erosion, network television can still draw a mass
audience, though it is arguable whether a prime-time schedule
filled with game shows and newsmagazines represents progress. But
even those networks that were pummeled by ``Millionaire'' find its
success reassuring in a way. CBS head of research David Poltrack
said his analysis showed that ``Millionaire'' pulled viewers away
from cable, which has been draining viewers from the broadcast
networks for years. Sassa tossed a verbal bouquet to what he called
ABC's ``phenomenal show,'' saying it ``really shows that broadcast
networks have the ability to create shows the public will find if
they capture the imagination of the entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the other networks will find it harder to muster kind
words if ``Millionaire'' stays on a roll next year. ``It's a
wonderful weapon to have,'' said ABC's Braun. ``It's not
necessarily like having one hit show. Depending on how you schedule
it, you can have a lot of hit shows.''

LOST SEASON LEAVES LITTLE TO DO BUT WATCH RICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _The pass tipped off his helmet, and Jerry Rice
looked back, watched the ball float up and grabbed it out of the
air, tumbling down for a 32-yard gain, his longest of the season by
13 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Candlestick crowd went crazy, chanting his name, enjoying
this shred of what remains of the 49ers' dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Quibble if you want about Rice's performance, for there's plenty
of material. The 32-yarder was a freak catch, aided by the hard
dome on his head. He let the first play of the game, a deep pass
along the sideline, slip through his hands. His team lost
miserably, abysmally, hideously to the sinking Green Bay Packers,
20-3.
</P>
<P>
   But in these days of Niner decline, there's only one thing left
to do. Watch Jerry.
</P>
<P>
   Watch him stumble. Watch him soar. Watch him for happy memories
of the past. Watch him for sad reminders of the present. Just watch
him. Because there's nothing else to do.
</P>
<P>
   Ask ABC. The network turned Monday Night Football into the Jerry
Rice Retrospective. He was the story, shown in closeup, his Bambi
eyes and bandage-trimmed nose filling up the screen as if he were a
1950s screen idol. On the sideline, on the field, before plays,
after plays, the camera followed him.
</P>
<P>
   Rice had called for this sort of attention a week earlier, when
he said he wasn't seeing enough passes to get into a rhythm. Yes,
we've heard it before from him, but never like this. Never when he
had been marginalized on a team that had slipped off the margins
and off the page. Never when he had dropped two passes in a game
and still felt slighted by the offensive plan.
</P>
<P>
   That was the drama of this wan game. Would the 49ers coach bow
to the legend, give him the ball and let him see whether he would
snap out of a funk? The opening play answered that question.
</P>
<P>
   Stenstrom threw deep, and the ball flew just beyond Rice's
reach, grazing his fingertips. In years past, Rice probably would
have made the catch and gone for the touchdown. Or he would have
seethed over missing it. In 1999, though, on a 3-8 team, he could
only be pleased to see a long pass of any kind - caught, dropped,
underthrown, overthrown, anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had connected on the first one, that could have been the
momentum change right there,'' he said. ``I worked the (cornerback)
good, and I think he was surprised that the old guy could still
move.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would have scored on the same pass three years
ago, before injuries that wiped him out in 1997, Rice said: ``No, I
felt as fast as I did three years ago, but the ball was... no, I'm
not going to point any fingers, or anything like that. Anytime you
can get your fingertips on it, or get close, you've got to make the
catch.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't want to criticize Stenstrom, but he admitted that with
new quarterbacks, ``you're going to lose chemistry.'' Does he want
a change, a new man behind center? ``That's not for me to answer
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since there aren't many better options than Stenstrom, he'd be
wasting breath and good will. Would it make a difference, if there
were another quarterback, if Rice saw more passes, if his
37-year-old hands were the 49ers' first target on play after play?
</P>
<P>
   Some of that can't be answered. Some of it, we can guess,
especially after seeing Rice covered by lone corners and still not
making plays. But let's reach for excuses, remembering that he was
invisible in the preseason, that he and Steve Young had started to
hit something that looked vaguely like a stride when Aeneas
Williams smacked the lefty QB unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Young obviously got the worst of that collision, but Rice didn't
make out too well, either, losing his telepathic mate. Going into
Monday's game, he hadn't made a catch of 20 or more yards in 11
games. On Monday, he made two. He had four catches altogether for
63 yards. He didn't look like the Jerry Rice of old, but he didn't
look like the Jerry Rice of Nov. 14, either.
</P>
<P>
   Rice tried to backpedal from his pleas of a week ago, saying
that he hadn't demanded anything. ``For some reason,'' he lamented,
``when I say I want to do more, people take that the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   But if his, well, heavy hinting yielded compliance from the
coaches, so what? We may think we have the answers on Rice's status
at 37, but why not search out every nuance. We seem to have the
answers on the 1999 Niners, but they're not allowed to write
themselves off. So if there's a choice between exploring Rice's
potential, and exploring everybody else's, that's no choice at all.
Watch Jerry. See what he can do, what he can't do. On a 3-8 team, a
legend deserves to spend everything he has left, every week.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the Packers game, ABC went to the archives and
dug up video of a Monday Night game five years ago, when Rice broke
the record for career touchdowns. In the video, his uniform was
bright scarlet, his face was beaming, and his teammates were
lifting him onto their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The camera immediately panned to the current day, showing Rice
in a drenched, muddy jersey, face grimly set, his team lining up
for another futile play. It was a sad contrast, the video set
against the live footage, but every second of it was worth
watching.

MEET SOME FOLKS IN SEATTLE DURING WTO WEEK  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VANESSA HO  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Some of the people on hand for the World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle:
</P>
<P>
   Wyconda Holcomb
</P>
<P>
   Seattle
</P>
<P>
   protester/student/fast-food worker
</P>
<P>
   Wyconda Holcomb carried no signs, banged no drums and wore a
simple sweat suit with no message. But she stood out in a sea of
thousands, commanding attention with a kinetic, vocal fury.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all about money! They are giving us genetically
engineered foods and using us like guinea pigs!'' she hollered to
the heavens, feet stomping, hair flying, fingers pointing east and
west.
</P>
<P>
   Her voice, which rumbled slow and fast, drowned out drums,
bullhorns and chants. Around her, people stopped chanting and
videotaped her.
</P>
<P>
   Holcomb, 20, grew up in Mobile, Ala., where she said few people
knew or cared about free trade. Because she missed the civil rights
movement in the '60s, she feels obligated to protest now. She says
she's a humanitarian, which meant she woke up at 5 a.m. and found a
sitter for her 3-year-old daughter, Nabi'hah, so she could march
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Holcomb moved to the Central Area about a year ago and studies
computer technology at Seattle Central Community College. Oh, and
she also works at Taco Time, which she was initially reluctant to
divulge. But don't ask her about any ``Franken-burritos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they don't have GM (genetically modified) food, because
it's really going to piss me off,'' she said, cranking up another
spitfire sermon. ``Who suffers from it? The water suffers, the air
suffers, the Earth suffers! Who benefits? The WTO!''
</P>
<P>
   Henri Benkoski
</P>
<P>
   Government official
</P>
<P>
   Brussels, Belgium
</P>
<P>
   While protesters jeered at delegates outside the Sheraton
Seattle Hotel &AMP; Towers, Henri Benkoski stood in the drizzle and
looked bemused. As deputy chief of staff for the French-speaking
government of Belgium, Benkoski was supposed to be at a European
Union meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It was his first time in Seattle, but he felt as if he were back
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like Europe. Each week or month, we have a big
demonstration,'' he yelled over the chants.
</P>
<P>
   Benkoski's agenda for the week was to promote international
diversity in movies, music, theater and books. He said Hollywood
dominates most Belgian movie screens, but he would like to promote
and subsidize his own country's cultural goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Hollywood movies, but I want to see my own Belgian and
French products,'' he said. ``We don't have a Hollywood. Ninety
percent of movie screens show American movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, many Belgians watch American television, which is OK
in moderation, he said. ``But we don't want 100 percent `Starsky
and Hutch' and `Streets of San Francisco.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, the last two American movies Benkoski saw were
``The Runaway Bride'' and ``The General's Daughter.'' He said
Richard Gere's movie was ``nice,'' but he didn't sound very
convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the kind of movie that was nice to see if you have been
working non-stop for 10 days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like the 135 countries to confirm a cultural
diversity from each country. People have a right to their own
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Serna
</P>
<P>
   Store manager
</P>
<P>
   Seattle
</P>
<P>
   Outside, mayhem. Inside, frustration and the giant sucking sound
of lost dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's protests meant an empty store at Mario's, an upscale
European clothing boutique on Sixth Avenue, where manager Jennifer
Serna watched anxiously behind a locked door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to talk to the people who decided that this was a
good thing,'' said Serna, a career clothing manager. ``Anywhere in
the U.S., it's a huge part of the economy, the month of December.
It's a severe loss of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the store, owned by a Portland clothier, did less than
10 percent of its regular holiday business.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, someone put graffiti on Serna's storefront, glued the
locks of neighboring shops and broke the windows to Old Navy and
Starbucks. The scrawled message on many windows: ``We are
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   But against whom, Serna wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact that people voice their opinion, but I don't
understand how vandalism helps,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a delegate from Norway bought a coat from her and asked
if the rioters were all from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   She was saddened to think that her city had turned ugly while
the world watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It offends me, for this to be happening in our very peaceful
city,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   C.C. Chen
</P>
<P>
   Trade official
</P>
<P>
   Taipei, Taiwan
</P>
<P>
   ``A great civil society,'' joked C.C. Chen, as he watched young,
masked men stomp on overturned newspaper boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, Taiwan's section chief for the Board of Foreign Trade, had
been on his way to the WTO opening reception at the Paramount
Theater when demonstraters shut down the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can anyone break through that?'' he asked good-naturedly.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has made a bid to become a member of the WTO, and Chen
had planned to monitor the proceedings. As a member country, he
said, Taiwan would be able negotiate market access and develop
rules on trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be able to participate, and participation is most
important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was his first visit to Seattle, which he had heard was
pleasant and pretty. But since his arrival Saturday, he had been
too busy to sightsee.
</P>
<P>
   Would he see the Space Needle? ``Maybe, after work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Had he eaten any good food? ``Yes, room service at the Westin.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen described his home city, Taipei, as ``crowded, noisy, never
sleeps.'' Also, he was very familiar with Starbucks, which he said
was on every five blocks. Personally, he likes the caramel
macchiatos: ``It's like a candy drink. ``It's nostalgia coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Botafogo
</P>
<P>
   Trade ambassador
</P>
<P>
   Brasilia, Brazil
</P>
<P>
   Jose Botafogo began his diplomatic career 40 years ago, after
earning a law degree in Rio de Janeiro when he was 24. Over the
decades, he has watched global trade expand while farmers in his
country grow poorer.
</P>
<P>
   As ambassador for foreign trade in Brasil, Botafogo arrived in
Seattle Monday to lobby for more exports of his country's sugar and
soya crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our farmers are poor because of the protectionist policies in
the United States and Europe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a high-ranking official, he keeps a demanding schedule. He
works 60 hours a week and spends about half his time on an
airplane, traveling around the globe. He speaks and reads five
languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, his
native tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you know other countries, the better you can serve
your own country,'' is Botafogo's philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   While not working, he jogs six kilometers a day, attends Mass on
Sunday in Brasilia and relaxes to classical music and bossa nova.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in Seattle Monday and has been true to his tireless
work schedule. As protesters ranted around him, he strolled Fifth
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know only my hotel lobby and this part right here,'' he
said.

A HOLIDAY NOT TO WISH ON ANYONE
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Tuesday, Dec. 7)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every holiday fanatic is out there, at the gate, or halfway down
the track, shopping like there's no tomorrow and so on. We know
that because we've been told that the day after Thanksgiving the
race begins.
</P>
<P>
   But ask yourself: What's the rush? There are weeks left to shop.
Today, folks, stores seldom close. They were even open on
Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted to, you could actually give yourself a breather.
Get in shape for the weeks ahead by taking the day off. Not to take
anything away from the merchants, but you know they'll get theirs.
The economy is fat. People are working. There may be as many
millionaires running around as Pokemons.
</P>
<P>
   How much shopping do you really have to do? Have you gained that
many more relatives and friends since last year?
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to panic. Think of what human beings can
accomplish in a few weeks. People fall in love and get married.
Wars are started and ended. Babies learn to walk. Lives change. You
ought to be able to round up a dozen or so presents in that time.
</P>
<P>
   Are there any real mystery people on your list? You know all of
their tastes. They already expect you to hit it or bomb. And they
already know you love them. Go to the feed store and get something
for their animals. There are seldom crowds at feed stores and their
parking lots are quite civil.
</P>
<P>
   But relaxing is not part of the tradition. Is not the challenge
to ``get through the holidays,'' as if it's some big chore?
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe you rationalize that if you go for broke, now you can
sit back at the end, oh silly you. Let's have ourselves a
multitasking Christmas. Overload is the ritual. Stress tolerance is
what we really celebrate at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   I was talking to someone right before Thanksgiving and after I
told her what I was doing and she said what she was doing, I
automatically groaned, ``Isn't this crazy?'' and she said the most
amazing thing. She said, ``No, it's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   So where do we find the wonder in all this? Can we put it on our
Visa, buy it over the Internet? Where's the big sale on wonder,
calm and peace?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a soothing ritual that a friend employs all year long,
not just in December. Diane spends every Sunday reading a book. The
whole day. She told a group of us about it one night and we gaped
at her with envy and admiration, as if she'd announced she spent
every Sunday locked in with Mel Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   But this is better.
</P>
<P>
   Diane decides during the week which book it will be and she
takes the entire day to read it, moving from her bed to her couch
to some sunny spot by a window. Sometimes she makes soup while
she's reading, but that's it.
</P>
<P>
   We could do that. We could take one day off during this madcap
season to read. Or sit on the deck in a wooly sweater and watch the
hawks. Imagine that. People would worry something was wrong, that
you were grieving a death or that you had the chicken pox. You
can't just drop out of the rat race when you've been such a good
little rat, can you?
</P>
<P>
   This is not the season of peace. This is Nutsville. This is the
season when if you don't already feel stressed out, you soon will
feel like you should. We must walk fast. Shop quickly. Buy on
impulse. Load up those aching arms. Overdraw. Overcharge. We are
like the little kid whose parents have let her stay up too late.
Her cheeks are flushed. She's laughing and crying at the same time.
She's stuffed with sweets and has been around too much chatter,
music and toys. She's sipped from the eggnog, been tickled and
squeezed and now spilled something on her red velvet.
</P>
<P>
   The kid needs to go to a quiet room and so do we.
</P>
<P>
   There are people who know how to do it. You'll be at a party,
babbling over what is still to be done and they serenely report how
they learned to back off. They pick a single event to make the
season bright _ one concert, play or ballet each December and focus
on just it. They get the best seats they can afford, dress
themselves and their kids to the max and make this event their big
Christmas present. A choral group filling the rafters with
``Gloria'' or the Sugar Plum Fairy spinning a dream, they say,
makes a longer lasting memory than the other stuff.
</P>
<P>
   No, I haven't managed to do it either, but doesn't it sound so
very smart?
</P>
<P>
   'Tis the season for demonstrating grace under pressure. Pressure
arrived with a full cart but grace seems to be lost in the crowd.

<P>
   It isn't in the dictionary, but the term boutique hotel has
become shorthand for a hotel with high-concept design and
personality, one that aspires to originality, attracting a young
crowd with hipness rather than grandeur, and (at least in the early
days of the trend) moderate prices. Trailblazing boutique hotels
include the Royalton, the Paramount and the Mercer in New York, the
Triton in San Francisco, and the Delano in Miami. But the trend can
be traced as far back as Blakes Hotel in London, a clubby luxury
retreat carved from a pair of Victorian townhouses that opened in
1981, where no two rooms are alike and the restaurant is as
adventurous as the decor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boutique hotels go beyond the functional purpose of providing
a clean bed and bathroom and feed the aspirations and desired
self-image of their guests,'' says Chekitan Dev, a professor of
marketing at Cornell University's Hotel School. ``A 55-year-old
business executive feels like a hip 25-year-old.''

   Unlike grand hotels, which share certain qualities and
amenities, boutique hotels are harder to define as a group. The
name implies small size, but it's not unusual for a so-called
boutique to have 200 rooms or more. And though moderately priced
boutique hotels exist, style, it appears, isn't cheap, especially
at the most recent entries. The boutiques, by definition, are also
whimsical. Some offer a handsome menu of services but don't turn
down your bed at night. Many substitute a stall shower for a
bathtub. And rooms can be tiny, with narrow hallways, particularly
in old buildings that morph into boutiques. But even the smallest
room will probably have an imaginatively stocked minibar, handsome
window treatments and terrific electronic toys.
</P>
<P>
   Though the boutiques pride themselves on their individuality,
similarities exist. Look for candles in the lounges, leather and
velvet furniture in big bold shapes, dramatic lighting. Instead of
chintz or damask, expect canvas or plush and solid colors. And if
you're still not sure if a hotel is, or aspires to be, a boutique,
look at the doorman. If he's young, good-looking and in head to toe
black, you've got the right place.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a look at four of the newest boutique hotels in New
York, Washington and San Francisco.

   Feather beds, duvets and a grand view
</P>
<P>
   By TERRY TRUCCO
</P>
<P>
   I was told that my room, like many at the W Tuscany, would be
large, but no one mentioned the view. An enormous window looked
from this spot at Park Avenue and 39th Street onto a dazzling New
York cityscape _ brownstones, a church spire and the Empire State
Building. I plopped onto the pretty checked daybed near the window,
wrapped myself in the chenille throw and gazed happily at the city
lights. The floor show ended at midnight, when the Empire State's
yellow and orange topknot blinked off. I fell asleep humming
Gershwin.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad all the surprises beamed my way by the W Tuscany weren't
so sweet. Though stylish and spacious, my room, 1602, lacked a
certain polish. The light in the cramped closet wouldn't turn on,
and the switch near the front door didn't work. The gray carpeting
was stained in several places. And the bathroom doorknobs were
dented, a reminder of the hotel's former incarnation as the
comfortable but staunchly unchic Doral Tuscany.
</P>
<P>
   The 122-room Tuscany officially became a member of Starwood's
hip W group on Nov. 1, following a dramatic refurbishment (the
lobby still wasn't finished when I stayed). It's on the same block
as its sister hotel, the 196-room W Court, another freshly
renovated addition to the chain. A third hotel, the 720-room W New
York, opened last year 10 blocks uptown.
</P>
<P>
   The two new Ws share a smoky palette of taupes, browns and reds
and an attractive, if increasingly familiar, clean but romantic
style, with pale walls, dark woods and flashy accents of velvet and
silver leaf. They also share their facilities. The Court's moody
Wet Bar lounge and atmospheric Icon restaurant, created by the
restaurateur Drew Nieporent, serve guests at both hotels, as will
the two-level fitness center planned for the Tuscany, according to
a front desk attendant, who, of course, wore black.
</P>
<P>
   I liked the Court's lobby, a spacious if self-conscious setting
with high-back sofas and huge round velvet ottomans that managed to
feel retro and futuristic at once. Comfortable by day, it is wildly
glamorous at night when it's lighted by a polished wood fireplace
and the requisite votive candles. The matching restaurant evokes a
1950s nightclub, albeit with bare dark wood tables. A friend joined
me for dinner, and our meals were outstanding, particularly the
goat cheese tart and the seared char. Not so our table. Though we
asked to be in the main dining room, we were told everything was
reserved and briskly escorted to a chilly, glass-walled room near
the kitchen. I observed, with annoyance, that some tables stood
empty in the main dining room all evening.
</P>
<P>
   I retreated to my room, surprisingly expensive at $470 on
weeknights, down to $269 on the weekend. It was so large that I was
astonished by the cramped bathroom. Clad in floor-to-ceiling
marble, it was pretty but small, with a tight-fitting stall shower
instead of a tub. But the room was soothing and restful. I loved
the buttery wool Roman shades on the windows and liked the
electronic accessories, which included a bedside CD player and a
portable keyboard with Internet access. My king-size bed, outfitted
with a feather bed and goose-down duvet, was splendid. And it was
all for sale _ the leather desk set ($175), the polar fleece
blanket ($90), even the mattress ($900). ``The experience doesn't
have to end when you check out,'' a catalog proclaimed. For me, the
memories were sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   The W Tuscany, 120 East 39th St.; (212) 686-1600, (877)
946-8357, fax (212) 779-7822; www.whotels.com. Double rooms from
$299 to $475; weekend rates $219 to $269, plus 13.25 percent tax,
and $2 per room per night occupancy tax.

   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   A warm welcome (plus 2 phones lines)
</P>
<P>
   By FRANK BRUNI
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, the staff at the Hotel George should have
recoiled from me. I arrived late on a lazy Sunday when I had taken
a vacation from shaving, showering, wearing clean clothing or any
other semblance of civilized behavior. But what they did, even
before I pulled out my credit card, was give me a spectacularly
warm welcome. The woman at the front desk extended her hand to
shake mine. The bellhop appeared instantly and struck up a friendly
conversation. If the point of a boutique hotel is to establish a
more intimate environment than larger establishments can or do,
then the George was hewing beautifully _ and, in my case, bravely _
to that mission.
</P>
<P>
   The 139-room George, which opened in February '98, actually
starts off with one mark against it, and that is location. Situated
on one edge of Capitol Hill, just a stone's throw from Union
Station, it does not offer the neighborhood pleasures of Dupont
Circle or Georgetown: the streets surrounding it can be ghostly at
night. The George makes the most sense for people actually
conducting business at or around the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   And yet its spirit is more artistic than that. Near the
reception area, contemporary sofas and chairs upholstered in blue
and black sit on red carpets, forming an archipelago of bold color
in a sea of white fossilized coral stone. Up a narrow flight of
stairs, teasingly visible from the lobby, is a glass-walled
billiards parlor available only to guests.
</P>
<P>
   My fourth-floor room was modern, sleek, sensibly laid out, just
spacious enough and rife with conveniences: an ironing board, a
coffee maker, a minibar, a hair dryer, you name it. Best of all,
the bathroom, tiled with white marble, was enormous, including a
tub and a separate, glass-walled shower.
</P>
<P>
   But I ultimately judge a hotel by whether it has the prescience
to anticipate and accommodate whatever my desires may turn out to
be. Had I wanted a workout, the George provided a well-equipped
fitness room in the basement. But on this night, I needed to do an
hour of work on my laptop, during which I needed to gain access to
the Internet while also making and receiving calls. The George gave
me two phone lines and plenty of outlets at the desk with a
cushioned, extremely comfortable chair that was just the right
height. I also wanted to watch a football game on ESPN and ``Sex
and the City'' on HBO, and I turned on the set with trepidation,
knowing that many hotels do not offer these channels. The George
does, along with about four dozen others.

JAILED PALESTINIANS BACK AWAY FROM CORRUPTION ALLEGATIONS AIMED AT
ARAFAT ADMINISTRATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ A push by Palestinian intellectuals to
curb graft in their government seemed to fizzle Tuesday when four
jailed dissidents backed away from a manifesto denouncing ``tyranny
and corruption'' in Yasser Arafat's administration.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by prison officials of the Palestine
Authority, the four said they ``did not mean to attack any person
or the president or to show a lack of confidence in Palestinian
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The words ran counter to the manifesto that was circulated
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It said, ``Alarm bells should sound in every village, town and
refugee camp. ... Our homeland is being sold out, and our people
are being betrayed.'' The authors accused Arafat of ``opening the
door to opportunists who are spreading corruption throughout
Palestinian society.''
</P>
<P>
   In the statement issued Tuesday, the four jailed Palestinians
said they never meant the document to be released publicly, but
rather intended it to be discussed in closed sessions of the
Palestinian Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal,'' the statement said, ``was to find a solution which
the government and the intellectual community see as possible. We
are against any (adverse) political activity which may arise from
this memorandum.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Palestinian who signed the document, Parliament Member
Hosam Khader, sent a similar ``clarification'' to an Arabic
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the backpedaling by five of 20 academics and
lawmakers who had signed the document would likely spell a quick
end to their attempt to confront the sensitive subject of official
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   And the jailings of the four were seen as another worrying sign
that the Palestinian state-in-the-making may not be as democratic
as many had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   The manifesto accused the Palestinian Authority of ``adopting a
modus operandi of graft, corruption, humiliation and exploitation
of the Palestinian people,'' and went on to hold Arafat ultimately
responsible for opening the doors for corruption to spread.
</P>
<P>
   It also criticized the Palestinians' performance in peace talks
with Israel, charging that Arafat's negotiators had ``deceived''
their people by promising statehood and a thriving economy, while
they went about ``selling out the Palestinian homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the document's being reported by the media, nine
intellectuals who signed it were jailed by Palestinian police. Two
other signers were put under house arrest. Nine Parliament members,
shielded by immunity, were not taken into custody, but legislators
defending the government talked about lifting their immunity so
they could be prosecuted. The Parliament will hold a special
session Wednesday in Gaza City to debate that possible punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Most Palestinian analysts lauded the intellectuals' efforts but
predicted that they would fail to stem what many people here
describe as rampant government corruption or to strengthen the
Palestinians' negotiating positions.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the government said the manifesto's language, which
came across in Arabic as highly inflammatory, had crossed the
boundaries of protected free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider the statement a major incitement,'' said Nabil
Amro, the Palestinian minister for parliamentary affairs. ``We see
clearly the line between incitement and freedom of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's administration was particularly incensed that the
petition had lambasted its negotiating performance just as it is
entering sensitive talks with Israel aimed at reaching a
comprehensive peace deal that, among other things, would include
the fate of millions of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations of corruption in Arafat's administration are not
new. Two years ago, Palestinian legislators, appalled by dishonesty
and mismanagement in government, forced Arafat to take some
measures to curb abuse, although legislators admit little has
improved.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that since its inception in 1994, the Palestinian
Authority has created the institutions of democracy _ a judiciary,
a legislature, a freely elected president _ but has actually
functioned more like a dictatorship. Parliament members engage in
lively debate and often pass ;thoughtful laws but their efforts
typically go unheeded, the critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat just ignores what he doesn't like, and he doesn't like
most of what they do,'' said Ghassan Khatib, director of the
Jerusalem Media and Communications Center.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators who signed the manifesto said they did it after
mounting frustrations at being ignored by government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've demanded to end corruption, we've asked for the people
responsible to be brought to court,'' said Ali Abu Rish, one of the
nine Parliament members who signed the petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, all our efforts have failed,'' he said. ``So we
decided to say it in a loud voice. This was a scream.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinian intellectuals agreed that the language of the
document was severe. But they were angered by arrests that they
said only spread fear and stifled free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language was crude,'' said Albert Aghazarian, head of
public relations at Birzeit University in the West Bank. ``But
detaining these people, it's a horrible mistake. The authority is
acting like a crude authoritarian state.''

   From the fluffy comforter on the bed to the dispatch with which
room service conjured a glass of chardonnay at 10:50 p.m., the
George did not hit a single false note. I could quibble over the
nonexistent view and poor light from two small windows, but I could
also praise the adjoining restaurant, Bis, which combines elegance
and deliciously rare tuna with, on many weeknights, a cast of
senators, cabinet members and television journalists.
</P>

   It was a very good thing I had eaten there before. On this

   Piles of pillows and high-tech gizmos
</P>
<P>
   By JAN BENZEL
</P>
<P>
   On the corner of Howard and Third Streets in San Francisco's
trendy SOMA (South of Market), men in black whisk cars into the
depths of the W's garage. Another man in black hands out key cards.
A third, wearing a wired headset, zipped me through the lobby of
this new entry in the W hotel chain, abuzz with a young, hip crowd,
up to the 23rd floor and careering around a few corners down a dim,
narrow hallway with black and tan horizontal-striped carpeting,
cool blue lights and glowing green exit signs.
</P>
<P>
   The effect would have been intimidating had not each of the men
in black (there were some women, too) been so ebulliently
welcoming. ``You're gonna love this hotel!'' promised Alex, in a
charming Eastern European accent, pointing out with glee that the
stripes of the carpeting matched the two-tone brickwork exterior of
the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art next door. The restaurant
downstairs, XYZ, was so good, he said, that I couldn't possibly get
a reservation, but I could have the same food by just calling room
service! ``Look,'' he said, ``You've got a T1-line.'' He brandished
the Category 5 high-speed Internet connection over the long black
desk. ``And a floating keyboard. You point it at the TV and check
your e-mail.'' He enumerated the other gizmos in the
just-big-enough, stylishly appointed room. The CD player! The
video-cassette player! Cordless phone! Nonallergenic pillow in the
closet, in case I was allergic to the four oversized fluffy feather
ones on the king-sized bed. The decent-sized bathroom, across the
tiny foyer from a full-length mirror and behind a sliding
ribbed-glass door, had a sleek sink, bathtub with in-tub shower,
waffle-weave robes, lots of thick white towels and strong plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call me if you need anything at all,'' Alex said,
reassuringly, and disappeared, leaving me to perch on the inviting
window seat and marvel at the westward view out over Yerba Buena
Gardens, the new urban park built over the Moscone Convention
Center, and the mountains beyond, bordering the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   When I returned to the W after dinner (elsewhere), the
ground-floor coffee bar and lobby were overflowing with an eclectic
crowd drinking, chattering, playing chess and generally milling
about.
</P>
<P>
   In my room, where the honey brown carpet looked and felt like
wide-wale corduroy, turndown had occurred. It involved two fortune
cookies left on a small beveled silver tray and the house CD, a
collection called ``Rhythm and Muse,'' that to my relief included
mostly musicians I knew: Stan Getz, Etta James, Grace Jones. In my
nest high above the city, under the soft brown brushed cotton
duvet, all was cozy and quiet. If I listened hard, I could detect
faint traffic sounds below.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast came when requested. But a small box of raisin bran, a
tiny pitcher of low-fat milk, a smallish glass of O.J. and some
sliced fruit, delivered with panache, cost $18.88, tip included on
the bill. I made my own (free) coffee. If I'd ordered it, the tab
would have been eight bucks more. With its high-tech comforts, this
423-room W, opened in May, clearly caters to a young business crowd
whose IPO ship has come in.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee, tea and the modishly packaged Aveda bath products were
the only gratis offerings in the room. The honor bar was full of
'90s essentials, among them Altoids, a box of Oreos and a safe-sex
Intimacy Kit. I grabbed a $3.74 bottled water for the flight home,
stopping for a peek at the 24-hour pool and gym on the fourth
floor. The glass-roofed area was busy even at 7:30 Sunday morning.
My car (valet parking, $30 a night) was waiting, but before I
jumped in, I plucked a perfect green apple from the bowl in the
lobby. Never pass up a free piece of fruit when you're staying in a
pricey hotel, I always say.

   Millennial minimalism
</P>
<P>
   By TERRY TRUCCO
</P>
<P>
   I sat on my bed in Room 1111 and tried to feel red. Urging me on
was a pamphlet explaining that each of the hotel's 193 rooms
showcases a primary color _ red, yellow or blue. ``Think about how
color affects your moods, your psyche, your sense of place,'' the
pamphlet intoned. This marriage of interior decoration and ``color
theory provocation,'' a concept inspired by Alexander Theroux's
book, ``The Primary Colors,'' was designed, according to the
pamphlet, to arouse the senses. I can't say I entered a state of
true redness, even after I uncorked the tiny scent vial that was
supposed to help me smell red. But I enjoyed the handful of cherry
Jelly Bellies. They matched the bedspread perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   What would a boutique hotel be without a theme? Just to be safe,
The Time, which opened in April, has two. Taking a cue from its
name, a wink at the hotel's location on the far outskirts of Times
Square, clocks and numerals abound, like the big black I through
XII emblazoned across the hall carpeting. The themes are diverting
but hardly necessary, since the hotel's design by Adam Tihany is
confident and smartly detailed, provided you like millennial
minimalism.
</P>
<P>
   A cool, futuristic atmosphere derived from brushed stainless
steel and marble envelopes you as you pass through the big glass
doors (yes, the doormen wear black). A glass elevator deposits you
on the second floor near the creamy-white lounge with woven leather
chairs and high-backed velvet sofas with leather pillows. At night,
the lounge was crowded, noisy and dark, lighted by votive candles
and little else. By day it was a light, roomy place to read a
newspaper or, less enjoyably, overhear a cell phone conversation. I
liked the miniature TV screens embedded, like moving photographs,
in the brushed-steel wall panels.
</P>
<P>
   Once in my room, however, I would happily have sacrificed some
style for space. My not inexpensive $309 room was extremely snug,
with room for a king-size bed and not much else. Fortunately, not a
scrap of space was wasted. The bed, a vivid scarlet centerpiece,
was backed by a huge rectangle of matching fabric, framed by creamy
white molding. An identical molding encased the enormous mirror
opposite the bed. The TV, set atop a discreet minibar, wore a
removable white canvas hood stenciled with the word NEWS. And a
creamy wool curtain hid the wide but shallow closet.
</P>
<P>
   The room looked crisp and new, and there were toys galore _
coffee maker, Bose radio, fax machine and plug-ins for laptops by
the desk. (A hotel spokesperson said there will be a keyboard and
Internet access in rooms by the end of the year.) But no one turned
down the bed at night. And the compact bathroom had a large stall
shower but no tub.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't imagine where I would put a room service tray, so I
had dinner downstairs at Palladin, the hotel's glamorous restaurant
named for its French chef. Though it was quite full, I was offered
a choice of tables and as a lone diner felt welcome. The dinner _
pumpkin soup with duck prosciutto and seared tuna _ was delicious.
As I ate, my thoughts wandered upstairs to my vibrant red room. The
color might help you rev up for a meeting. But if I were to return
for a quiet weekend, I'd ask for something in blue.

profoundly changed views on what is normal, if annoying, behavior
by adolescents. No longer is the playground scrap or the kickball
tussle deemed a rite of passage. Known most often as the ``zero
tolerance'' code, aggression is viewed as violence, and teachers
are typically forbidden from simply resolving any physical dispute
with a lecture. Instead, they are instructed to file a report with

 By RITA REIF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A gold-rush treasure, burnished by 130 years in the icy depths
of the Atlantic, has finally reached its destination _ New York.
Mined, sifted, assayed or minted in California, the three tons of
gold bars, ingots, coins and dust was shipped on Aug. 20, 1857 from
San Francisco bound for New York, but not even a small portion of
it ever made it until a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo that many people envisioned would stop a monthlong run
on New York banks was taken by the S.S. Sinora to Panama and
transferred by rail to the paddle steamer Central America. After a
stop in Havana, the boat steamed north, and into the path of a
hurricane. It went down in the storm 160 miles off the coast of
Cape Fear, N.C., in one of the greatest peacetime marine disasters
in American history.
</P>
<P>
   The shipwreck took the lives of 425 passengers, officers and
crew _ two-thirds of those on board. And the loss of the bullion _
valued at $1.2 million, or about one-fifth the gold then in Wall
Street banks _ compounded the financial crisis that had dangerously
lowered gold reserves in New York banks, spurring the Panic of
1857.
</P>
<P>
   Then, though insurers made swift payments to the gold's owners,
the recession deepened: 980 businesses failed in New York and 1,400
banks closed nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a decade after the treasure was salvaged and a year after
the battles over its ownership ended in the federal district court
in Norfolk, Va., there are once again powerful expectations for at
least a fraction of the gold.
</P>
<P>
   The American and British insurers or their successors were
awarded nearly 400 pounds, about eight percent of the total. The
rest of the gold went to the salvagers, the Columbus America
Discovery Group of Ohio, which was founded by the engineer-explorer
Tommy Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   From 1986 to 1989, Thompson and his crew, using a robot vehicle
to scour the wreckage and vacuum the ocean floor, wrested gold and
artifacts from the rotting timbers and rusted iron ribs of the
Central America. Thompson has not yet disclosed what he intends to
do with his much larger hoard.
</P>
<P>
   The insurers' gold, which arrived in New York at Sotheby's a
year ago, will be sold first in a live auction and then hours later
on the Internet. In the past, Internet sales have come a week or
more after the live ones. The total expected for the treasure, now
on view on the Internet (sothebys.amazon.com), could reach $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   The more valuable pieces will be auctioned live in 250 lots, to
sell for $1,000 to $350,000 each, on Wednesday and Thursday. On
Thursday evening the sale moves to the Web site, which is operated
jointly by Sotheby's and Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   There, 1,000 lots of gold _ nuggets, 40 pounds of dust and one
bar _ will be offered over two weeks. The estimates range from $100
to $1,000 for each of the nuggets and vials of dust; the hefty gold
bar, weighing 374 ounces, may sell for from $125,000 to $175,000.
All told, the sale may bring as much as $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few pieces of gold out there with a provable
provenance from the gold rush,'' said David E. Tripp, a Sotheby's
coin consultant in charge of the sale. ``The gold has an allure,
over and above its intrinsic value. This is fairy dust from the
bottom of the ocean _ far better than a snapshot of an important
moment in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Gold sold for roughly $20 an ounce when the Central America went
down; today it's worth is about 15 times that, or $300 an ounce.
But historical gold is so valued by coin collectors and history
buffs that it commands much higher figures depending on its
fineness, story and look.
</P>
<P>
   The gold bars, produced by five different assayers, bear stamped
markings ranging from crude to fine, and some pieces are gloriously
colored, from blood red to iron brown, patinas left by the ship's
rusting ribs.
</P>
<P>
   The tiniest ingot in the sale, a five-ounce piece stamped Blake
&AMP; Co., looks good enough to eat, like a foil-wrapped chocolate. It
is estimated to sell for $30,000 to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   A brick-like bar, by Kellogg &AMP; Humbert at 663 ounces, the
largest in the sale, may bring as much as $275,000. But the bar, by
Justh &AMP; Hunter, with the highest valuation _ $350,000 _ weighs 652
ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, the gold had remained intact after the Central
America sank, and much of it was together on the ocean floor. The
bars, once boxed, had toppled like dominos, and many coins were
found still stacked. But the gold dust, which looks like Grape Nuts
and was probably carried aboard in sacks or pouches that men wore
around their waists, was widely strewn about the site.
</P>
<P>
   To David Redden, an executive vice president at Sotheby's who
oversees books, collectibles and Internet sales, it is the gold
dust that inspires the mystique about gold and greed. ``The gold
dust, panned in the mountain streams of Northern California, was
brought to town in the pockets of the miners,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even the greed of those who knew that gold fetched a higher
price in New York dissolved when lives were at stake. ``The people
who went down on that ship would have discarded anything weighty _
the coins, nuggets and even the gold dust _ as they were swimming
for the doors and an escape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The gold dust is an extraordinary human story,'' he said,
``that takes us from the top of the Sierra Madre to the bottom of
the Atlantic.''

 &HT;    Florida's Chandler hopes to have the last laugh against
AlabamaBy Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Florida's Jeff Chandler received dozens of
letters from all over of the country the week after Oct. 2. On that
date, Chandler missed the extra point in overtime that helped
Alabama win their matchup in The Swamp, 40-39.
</P>
<P>
   Some letters offered support; many others were downright nasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget this one,'' said Chandler, a junior from
Jacksonville. ``It said: `You'll always remember the time you made
the Gators lose. You look a little stressed out. Why don't you get
a girlfriend _ like Doug Johnson.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't very funny at the time. But Chandler was able to
chuckle about it Tuesday in a conference room beneath Ben Hill
Griffin Stadium. Two months after the fact, Chandler knows he still
can have the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama and Florida are scheduled for a rematch Saturday at the
Georgia Dome. For the fourth time this decade, the two teams are
meeting in the SEC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   When Chandler found out who the opponent would be, no Gator was
happier than he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've kicked in big games before,'' Chandler said. He made
three field goals, including a 50-yarder, in a 30-23 loss to No. 1
FSU two weeks ago. He also made field goals of 23, 33 and 41 yards
in a 23-21 win over Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this game is any bigger than the FSU game was,''
he said. ``So I feel like I can handle the pressure well. I'd like
for it to come down to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler said revenge is not so much his motivation. His main
goal is silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing when you have such a good year and
everybody keeps talking to you about the Alabama kick,'' he said.
``That's why I want this game to get over with. I want to have a
good game. Then, everybody can talk about this Alabama game.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that missed extra point was about the only blemish on
the record of Chandler's season. Heading into Saturday's game,
Chandler leads the nation in field-goal percentage, with a success
rate of 87.5 percent (21 of 24). He is first in the SEC and second
in the nation in field goals made (1.9 per game) and is second in
the league in scoring with 9.1 points a game. Chandler also is a
semifinalist for the Lou Groza, which goes annually to the nation's
best place-kicker.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he has done it at a school where kickers usually
are looked down upon. In coach Steve Spurrier's world, field goals
are just the result of inept offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Spurrier doesn't like to kick field goals, I can tell
you that,'' Florida quarterback Doug Johnson said. ``We like to
score (touchdowns). That's not taking anything away from Jeff
Chandler, but when we come off the field, it feels like we're
punting instead of kicking a field goal.''

   After saving the Gators' hides on a few occasions, Chandler has
helped change Spurrier's tune about kicking specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He leads the nation in field goals; why wouldn't I be
confident in him?'' Spurrier said. ``He's the No. 1 field-goal
kicker in the country. He can make them from the 50 on in. That's
good to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's path to becoming the starting place-kicker at Florida
is a strange one. Both his parents, Donald and Pamela, graduated
from the University of Georgia and were devout Bulldog fans.
</P>
<P>
   His mother grew up in Marietta, Ga. His father ran track at
Georgia, 1967-69; his 110-meter hurdle time of 14.37 seconds
remains the fourth-fastest in school history. Chandler has spent a
lot of time in and around Athens and Atlanta. And having grown up
in Jacksonville, he is quite versed in the tradition of the
Georgia-Florida rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``All through Georgia-Florida weekend, I was always a big
Georgia Bulldog fan,'' he said. ``But I got into school here, and I
was just lucky when I got the opportunity to walk on.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler did not play football until his senior year at Mandarin
High, concentrating instead on soccer and tennis. He walked on for
Florida football at the urging of former Gator assistant and
Georgia letterman Barry Wilson. Chandler played in one game in
1997, then took over as the starting place-kicker after Collins
Cooper's fateful miss against Tennessee in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Chandler is 32 of 39 in field goals for his career.
Oddly enough, he has missed seven of 77 point-after attempts in
that time. None was bigger, of course, than the miss against
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   As for the infamous letter-writer, Chandler hasn't decided
whether to write back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But first, Chandler would like to write a different ending
against Alabama.
</P>

</P>

   Florida's Jeff Chandler missed an extra point and a 41-yard
field goal attempt in a 40-39 overtime loss to Alabama on Oct. 2.

CORNYN URGES JUSTICES TO UPHOLD CONVICTION OF TEXAS MAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ State Attorney General John Cornyn urged the
Supreme Court on Tuesday to uphold the child molestation conviction
of a north Texas man, even though he was convicted based largely on
testimony that would have been inadmissible at the time of the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Scott Leslie Carmell, now serving a life sentence
for aggravated sexual assault and related offenses against his
stepdaughter, countered that the Constitution should have barred
Texas prosecutors from allowing the victim to testify at trial.
</P>
<P>
   During the hourlong argument, the justices questioned both
lawyers in weighing the vexing issue of whether the Constitution's
Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits prosecutors from using at trial
testimony that would have been prohibited when the attack occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The high court is expected to render its decision in the case,
Carmell vs. Texas, by July.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, making his first appearance before the justices as Texas
attorney general, said the state rightfully applied to Carmell's
repeated attacks a 1993 law that made it easier for sexual assault
victims to testify. The new law for the first time allowed victims
between ages 14 and 17 to testify against their alleged attacker
even if they waited more than six months to tell anyone of the
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Carmell's victim, who had waited more than six months before
telling anyone of the attacks, was permitted to testify at his
trial because of the new law.
</P>
<P>
   Carmell's court-appointed attorney, Richard Bernstein of
Washington, said the Ex Post Facto Clause should have barred
prosecutors from using the testimony of the victim, identified in
court papers only as KM. That argument, however, has lost in Texas
courts, which upheld the conviction, prompting Carmell, formerly of
Iowa Park, to appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Carmell's high-court appeal addressed only four of the 15 counts
on which he was convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The four counts concerned charges that Carmell attacked KM
before the new 1993 testimony rule took effect but when she was
over age 14. During that time, the old testimony rule would have
required KM to tell someone of the attacks within six months, which
she failed to do.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors, using the new rule, had KM testify to those
earlier attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Carmell, based in part on that testimony, was convicted in 1997
of sexually abusing his stepdaughter from age 12 to 17, a period
that stretched from 1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the court rules in Carmell's favor, Cornyn said the
convict would remain in prison for a long time based on his
conviction on the other 11 counts.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing Carmell's case, Bernstein argued that the
Constitution's authors inserted the Ex Post Facto Clause to prevent
legislatures, after a crime had been committed, from relaxing rules
prohibiting testimony in order to ensure a conviction. The Texas
Legislature, by easing restrictions on the testimony of alleged
child sexual assault victims, made it easier for prosecutors to win
Carmell's conviction, Bernstein argued.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor interjected that the
constitutional provision is designed to prevent legislators from
outlawing an act that was not a crime when it was committed. The
Texas statute does not change state criminal law but merely enables
a witness to testify, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a very sympathetic case,'' O'Connor said, noting
that Carmell sexually assaulted a young teen-ager. The justice
added that she doubts Carmell considered the Texas rule on the
admission of testimony before attacking his stepdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein, however, responded that the new law governing child
testimony was significant to Carmell's criminal case in that it
meant the difference between his acquittal and life in prison. The
statutory change did not merely alter the rules governing testimony
but created the equivalent of a new criminal statute that was used
unconstitutionally to secure Carmell's conviction, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn countered that the new rule on testimony amounted to ``a
mere procedural change'' that did not affect state criminal law
regarding sexual assault. Prosecutors, therefore, did not violate
Carmell's constitutional rights when they had his stepdaughter
testify, the attorney general added.
</P>
<P>
   But Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Stephen G. Breyer said a
procedural rule could violate the Ex Post Facto Clause if it makes
it easier for the government to win a conviction it might have lost
under the rules in effect when the crime was allegedly committed.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Cornyn said courts have often upheld changes in
rules regarding testimony despite Ex Post Facto challenges.
</P>
<P>
   He cited ``rape shield laws'' that bar criminal defendants from
basing their defense on their alleged victim's sexual history. The
laws have been used to protect victims, even if they were attacked
before the statutes were enacted, Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Solicitor General Beth Brinkmann voiced the
Clinton administration's support for Texas' position.

FORMER GERMAN CHANCELLOR ADMITS TO USE OF SECRET PARTY FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl,
who has been facing widening accusations of having run illegal
political slush funds, admitted Tuesday that he had used cash from
secret bank accounts to help local branches of his party, the
Christian Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's admission aggravated a nationwide uproar that began three
weeks ago, after disclosures that the party's former treasurer
secretly accepted about $530,000 from an arms merchant in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, prosecutors have turned up evidence that Kohl's
party maintained numerous secret bank accounts that may have been
used to accept illegal political contributions from business
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl engineered the reunification of Germany and reigned as
chancellor for 16 years before losing an election last year. Until
Tuesday, he had dismissed all the allegations as ``a lot of noise
about nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of his own former colleagues have gone public with
their own allegations in the last few days. Heiner Geissler, who
was general secretary of the Christian Democratic Union from 1977
until 1989, said on Monday that he had repeatedly argued with Kohl
about the secret accounts and that the former chancellor knew
everything about them.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Christian Democratic leaders acknowledged that there
may indeed have been improper financial dealings and that these may
have persisted until as recently as a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In an uncharacteristically contrite written statement, Kohl
admitted that he had used secret accounts to provide financial
support for local party branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have, as chairman of the party, deemed as necessary the
confidential treatment of certain issues, such as special payments
to party branches and associations,'' Kohl said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl said it was reasonable to describe the secret accounts as
having been ``managed separately'' from those of the party's normal
federal treasury. He said he regretted that he may have allowed a
``lack of transparency'' in party finances and perhaps even a
violation of the party's own rules. ``That is not what I wanted,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are investigating what appears to be a network of
accounts. The parliament plans to establish a special investigative
committee on Thursday. And the Christian Democratic Union has
itself hired the accounting firm of Ernst &AMP; Young to examine its
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible that not all the party rules were adhered to,''
said Wolfgang Schauble, Kohl's successor as chairman of the
Christian Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``No one enriched themselves.''

<P>
   Mike Phillips wanted to go home. An animation artist, he had
worked in New York for MTV and in Berlin for a film studio, but he
couldn't get Barrie, a town 60 miles north of Toronto, out of his
mind. ``I missed being able to drive a short distance to the
wilderness,'' said Phillips, 25.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite the paucity of animation work there, home he went
this year and began trolling the Internet for work. That is how he
discovered eLance, a jobs bazaar (www.eLance.com) where freelancers
can list their skills and search for work. And though he named a
price that was more than 50 percent above what a New York employer
wanted to pay, he landed an assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is the beneficiary of an economic boom that has driven
unemployment in the United States to its lowest level since
astronauts were landing on the moon and has made employers
desperate for skilled workers. To cater to them, an entirely new
kind of job fair is springing up, run not out of a convention
center but in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ELance and its rivals are the information-age equivalent of the
medieval town square where workers-for-hire called out their
skills. Today's job seekers do the same, but through their computer
keyboards. And whether they are computer programmers in Atlanta or
Finnish translators in San Diego, they can find work without
traveling. For their part, employers gain access to a new pool of
freelancers without having to give them office space or fringe
benefits. Across the economy, said Berrud Sheth, the chief
executive of eLance, ``the supply is sitting all over the world,
and demand is where it is,'' often unable to move.
</P>
<P>
   Though small, the sites tap into three of today's hottest
employment trends: the rise of outsourcing, the Internet revolution
and the surge in people working at home as telecommuters or
small-business owners. In 1998 alone, the number of Americans
identifying themselves as self-employed rose 15 percent, to 10
million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest jobs bazaar is Monster Talent Market, a part of
Monster.com, the most popular Internet job-hunting site. After five
months in business, Monster Talent Market says it has signed up
110,000 independent contractors and more than 7,500 employers.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, one of the newest players in the field,
FlexMind.com, is deliberately elitist. The Massachusetts start-up
wants to register only students at a dozen or so of the most
selective universities in the country, assuming that employers
would love to hire them for part-time assignments and that the
students who otherwise might have to wait tables would jump at the
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice way for a company to have a low-commitment preview
of an employee,'' said FlexMind chief executive Julius Mokrauer. In
FlexMind's first two months, about 500 students and 40 companies _
including American Express and barnesandnoble.com _ have registered
on the site, Mokrauer said. He left his job as a trader at Lehman
Brothers to start the company last year after hiring a Harvard law
student for $35 an hour and realizing what a bargain that was for
his employer.
</P>
<P>
   FlexMind charges employers 20 percent of whatever they are
paying to the freelancer. Monster takes about 10 percent but no
more than $1,000. ELance, which is now free for both freelancers
and companies, will begin charging next year.
</P>
<P>
   With so many job openings going begging these days, the
freelance Web sites can be a boon to employers. Susan Patnaik, for
example, was having trouble finding an artist in New York to
illustrate a graphic novel _ a type of comic book for adults _ that
she was producing. She had called artists she knew and asked for
recommendations but was striking out.
</P>
<P>
   So she listed the assignment on eLance for $350. Bids started
arriving the next day, and she chose Phillips, even though he
wanted $550, because she was impressed with the samples she had
downloaded. Presto: talent-hungry Ms. Patnaik had her worker, and
job-hungry Phillips had his 25-hour assignment, even though they
live hundreds of miles apart, do not know anybody in common and may
never meet.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, $550 is hardly enough for Phillips to live on, and
thus far he has not landed any other jobs through eLance. The site
has not attracted enough companies to offer a primary source of
income for anybody. Even on Monster Talent Market, only two or
three deals are made each week.
</P>
<P>
   From an employer's perspective, the sites can create as many
problems as they solve, since virtually anyone can post a resume.
On eLance, Phillips said, ``It seems like there are a lot of young,
inexperienced artists applying for jobs.'' And HotJobs.com, a rival
to Monster, does not offer an auction site, the company says,
because its clients _ big companies _ have shown little interest.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a few big success stories. Benita Kenn quit her
job as a public-relations manager for a California technology
company this year to spend more time with her folk band. She put
her resume on Monster Talent Market and got two jobs. The first,
with a golf merchandise site, began in August and is just ending,
while the other, with a seller of personalized T-shirts and mugs,
began in October. Ms. Kenn has been working an average of 20 hours
a week at pay that she says is typical for a public-relations
consultant. (That would be about $100 an hour, said people in the
industry.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, she uses her old contacts because she said she cannot
rely solely on the auction site. ``Ideally, there would be hordes
of people bidding for me,'' Ms. Kenn said. ``But that's not where
it's at at this point.''

(Ann Cotter is medical director of the Mind Body Center for
Complementary Medicine, Morristown Memorial Hospital in Morristown,
N.J.) 
 By ANN COTTER with MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I first came into contact with complementary medicine as a
dancer. I saw therapies like pilates and yoga help dancers with
their movement problems. When I got into physical medicine and
rehabilitation training and found that these therapies were not
widely used or known about, I found out as much as I could about
how they could help people with medical problems. In addition, I've
been interested in Chinese medicine since I was a little girl. I
did my seventh-grade science fair project on acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
   I spend about half of my time seeing patients. I also have to
educate medical staff about complementary medicine. Doctors are a
tough audience; they've seen a lot of fads come and go, so it's
important that I show them that there is evidence these are not
just quack therapies. In an acupuncture class I teach, I make them
practice the techniques on one another. Many come in skeptics and
leave converts. I've heard so many physicians say that learning
acupuncture was the one course that changed their practice more
than any other.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow physician on staff with me at the hospital I used to
work at had back pain that had not responded to physical therapy,
oral medications or injections. After three treatments, his pain
had subsided significantly. ``I don't know if it was you or God,''
he said, ``but I have to admit I'm a lot better.'' ``Oh,'' I said.
``I'm sure it was both. We try to work together whenever
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Treatment also makes believers out of patients. They are often
nervous when they come in for acupuncture, so I give them a needle
in one of a couple of spots, like the top of the head, and this
usually calms them down right away. By the end of a session,
because of the endorphin release prompted by the procedure, they
can be pretty euphoric. We make sure they sit down a few minutes
before leaving and that they have their coat and purse with them. I
jokingly tell them not to sign any large checks or make any large
purchases right after treatment.
</P>
<P>
   One of my patients is a businessman with sarcoidosis, a
connective tissue disease. He decided to get acupuncture, hoping it
would relieve his symptoms of numbness and tingling in his feet.
The day he came in I had a resident following me around. She was a
little nervous about watching all the needles go in. The patient
was obviously nervous, too. I said, ``I'm asking you all these
questions, but what you really want to know is if this is going to
hurt.'' Well, I stuck a needle in the top of his head. He
immediately felt more relaxed. The med student was sitting there
with big eyes. I thought, ``Maybe I'll put a needle in her head,
too.'' I did, she calmed down, and we all had a good laugh.
</P>
<P>
   We insist that everybody who works at the center has some type
of mind-body practice themselves. If there's a lot of turmoil and
stress among the staff, then we're not going to give patients the
feeling of peace and well-being that we try to teach.

MERGER MANIA GOT YOU DOWN? THINK SMALL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Texas, Mass.)   By FRED ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We might be forgiven for concluding that everything in corporate
America is getting bigger and bigger. The global couplings in
autos, oil and gas, financial services, telecommunications and now
pharmaceuticals sometimes give the impression that the business
world is driving toward an acquisition apocalypse. When the dust
settles, we will all draw a paycheck from the same employer.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Thomas W. Malone to file a minority report. Malone is
a professor of information systems at the Sloan School of
Management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an alumnus
of Xerox's creative Palo Alto Research Center. For five years, he
has been co-director of a major-league effort to think about what
shape the company and the workplace will take in the new century,
now only a month away.
</P>
<P>
   In his view, the century will bring a new golden age for small
enterprise and a new springtime for individual creativity in
business. Communications in the Internet era will be so powerful,
so rich, so cheap that even the smallest enterprises, already
nimble, will be armed with the information they need to compete
with corporate giants. He expects an economy in which companies as
small as 1 to 10 talented people can thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Newborn Web businesses are already swirling like snowflakes. How
long before they carpet the ground? Malone summarized his views
last month at a valedictory gathering of M.I.T.'s initiative on
Inventing the Organizations of the 21st Century, an extensive
research effort he cofounded in 1994. The project (ccs.mit.edu/21c)
has drawn in two dozen scholars and numerous companies, with
financing from British Telecommunications, A.T. Kearney, National
Westminster Bank, Union Bank of Switzerland and a consortium of
Norsk Hydro and other Norwegian business interests.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's talk in Wong Auditorium on the M.I.T. campus amounted
to instructing the elephants on the mouse. The assemblage was
mostly big companies trying to peer over the horizon, among them
Ford Motor, DaimlerChrysler, Fidelity Investments, State Farm,
Polaroid, Intel, Sun Microsystems, Compaq Computers,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, Andersen Consulting and the Naval Undersea
Warfare Center. (One mouse in the crowd, tiny Sohodojo of Raleigh,
N.C., billed itself as ``a nanocorp'' and lamented the tax
disadvantages of working out of the home.)
</P>
<P>
   Malone's term is ``the e-lance economy,'' a play on the word
``freelance.'' He expects a business landscape in which much work
that large corporations now do will be done by ``temporary
companies'' _ ad hoc combinations of small specialist firms that
come together to tackle a single project and disband upon its
completion.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of that economy will be a vast electronic
marketplace in business services, already taking shape. Small
companies will be able to rent the design, manufacturing and
marketing muscle now available only to big businesses. Small talent
pools will be free to focus on what they do best.
</P>
<P>
   Malone likes to talk about TopsyTail, a tiny Dallas-based
producer of hair and fashion accessories. Relying on a score of
vendors, from demand forecasting through manufacturing and order
fulfillment, it has produced more than $100 million in sales at
retail with three employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not good with employees, I am good with vendors,''
TopsyTail's energetic founder, Tomina Edmark, said in an interview
on Monday. Outsourcing to the limit not only fits her managerial
personality, she said. It also provides instant, inexpensive
expertise in a consumer business where the race is always to the
swift. Her next step is a Web store, herroom.com, to sell women's
underwear online, starting in February.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of an economy of microenterprises are everywhere.
Malone sees them in the surge in outsourcing; in the popularity of
telecommuting; in the proliferation of virtual companies; in the
erosion of the Fortune 500 as the premier employer; in the legions
of people who opt for freelance or part-time work. He sees the same
trajectory inside large companies, which increasingly work through
project teams, joint ventures, ad hoc alliances, internal markets
and independent business units.
</P>
<P>
   In some familiar industries, the e-lance economy has long been
the norm. ``It is the way that films get made,'' Malone said.
``It's also the way that we make buildings.'' Decades ago, the
major Hollywood studios had everything under one roof. Today, a
coalition of artistic and technical talents is assembled piece by
piece. The studio does the financing and manages marketing and
distribution.

   Almost everyone believes the next century will see much greater
decentralization of business decision-making. There the debate
begins. Will the Internet foster an economy of small enterprises,
or will it make it possible to build a global empire far more
extensive than anything known today? Is the prototype Edward Jones,
the investment firm, with more than 5,000 local offices united by
cutting-edge communications and an engrained culture of serving the
careful long-term investor? Or is it the cottage industry of
thousands of independent financial advisers who rely on Charles
Schwab for their transaction needs and tap the Internet for endless
sources of financial analysis?
</P>
<P>
   Many experts, including some at the M.I.T. conference, say that
economies of scale and new efficiencies in harnessing corporate
learning favor the larger-and-larger structure. They say that only
the largest will be able to assemble and manage the costly
information engines needed to power a global empire. Huge companies
like BP Amoco are devising new systems to organize and index the
vast business savvy that exists within their ranks but today is
tacit and untapped.
</P>
<P>
   Malone contends that it is easier to think about flattening the
corporate hierarchy by chopping away at middle management and
empowering underlings _ all half-measures in his view _ than it is
to grasp the workings of a vast network of many, many small players
under no central direction or control. (Some people call that a
market.) But his model of creativity and efficiency is not merely a
leaner, flatter company.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, consider the celebrated Linux operating
system, which was developed and perfected by thousands of
volunteers after Linus Torvalds posted his early efforts on the
Internet and invited all and sundry to have a go at them. Or
consider the Internet itself. Malone invariably draws smiles when
he asks if the Internet could have been developed by AT&AMP;T, with the
normal panoply of corporate procedures and clearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's literally no one in charge of the Internet,'' he said
at the conference, ``no one who can shut it down, no one who can
keep you from connecting with it.'' Fundamentally, it is a
collection of interaction protocols, a set of rules for exchanging
information. ``Anyone who follows those rules can basically play
any role they want.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the idea: No one organization can match a thriving
marketplace of ambitious talents for creativity and innovation. So
why shouldn't a General Motors, instead of being wedded to its
in-house battalions of engineers, open its needs to innumerable
design enterprises from outside? That is the open architecture that
propels Silicon Valley. Why not tap it to build cars?

GROUP GIVES GOVERNMENT LOW MARKS IN AIDS PREVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although the federal government gets high marks for
bankrolling AIDS research and treatment programs, it scores an F in
funding U.S. prevention programs and only a C in helping other
countries battle the deadly disease, an advocacy coalition here
called AIDS Action said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time of increasing HIV infection rates and evidence of
laxity around safer sex, official Washington has tragically
short-changed domestic prevention efforts and has failed to launch
new initiatives around HIV prevention and education,'' the group
said in a new study released on the eve of World AIDS Day
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS Action is one of the largest coalitions seeking greater
U.S. commitment to stamp out the disease, which attacks the body's
immune system. The group annually issues a report card on the
federal response to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   This year's F on AIDS prevention was down from the government's
D grade last year, and the group cited inadequate funding as the
reason.
</P>
<P>
   In the new fiscal year, the government has allotted $695 million
for AIDS prevention through the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), a $37.5 million increase over the previous year.
But AIDS Action, a coalition of 3,200 advocacy groups that had
sought $848 million, contended that the increase is not enough to
bolster public education programs that might slow the burgeoning
infection rate in young people.
</P>
<P>
   In what public health officials have described as an alarming
trend, people under 25 comprise nearly half of the estimated 40,000
new cases of HIV infections each year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Zingale, AIDS Action's executive director, said the trend
was linked to the federal government's failure to provide more
money for prevention programs. ``We've spent more on teaching our
kids about the make-believe world of Pokemon (a video game) than on
teaching them about the real dangers of HIV,'' which causes AIDS,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In giving the government a C (up from an F in 1998) for trying
to help stem the spread of the disease globally, AIDS Action noted
that the Clinton administration in the last year has focused on the
Third World, where the epidemic has struck the hardest. The
government has allotted $100 million to help other nations stem the
AIDS crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the coalition charged, ``the U.S. government has failed
to aggressively support emergency care initiatives and HIV
prevention worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   The group gave the government an A-minus for AIDS research
funding and a B for its support of the care and treatment of AIDS
victims, the same grades it held last year. The ratings reflect the
robust annual federal allocations of more than $1.5 billion for the
care of U.S. citizens fighting the disease and about $1.8 billion
for the search for new treatments.
</P>
<P>
   While not addressing the coalition's report card directly, the
CDC in Atlanta agreed that more money is needed to increase AIDS
prevention. ``The nation must make a renewed and intensified
commitment to prevention,'' the agency said in its own report
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC added that it has made significant strides in AIDS
prevention, which it said has ``helped slow the rate of new HIV
infections in the U.S. from over 150,000 in the late 1980s to
approximately 40,000 per year now.'' AIDS killed 17,171 Americans
last year, compared with 21,445 in 1997 and 37,221 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. death rate also has plummeted because government- and
industry-sponsored research has produced strong anti-viral drugs
and a new class of treatments known as protease inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   But because most developing nations can't afford the costly
drugs or many of the prevention programs, the death rate from the
disease is spiraling upward in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   According to a separate study released last week by the United
Nations, 2.6 million people worldwide will die of AIDS this year,
the highest annual number since the epidemic began. The majority of
those deaths are likely to occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where 70
percent of people with HIV reside.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations reported that about 5.6 million new HIV
infections will occur this year, raising the number of people
currently living with the infection globally to about 33.6 million.

 By CHRISTOPHER REARDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By now David Rousseve is a familiar face at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music. But when he returns this week, to
present his third commissioned piece in seven years, he will show a
side he has never revealed before.
</P>
<P>
   Long accustomed to working with black female vocalists, Rousseve
has turned for the first time to classical music _ and not just the
sweet sound of Puccini. He punctuates the new piece, a collage of
dance and theater called ``Love Songs,'' with the enigmatic strains
of Wagner, whose famously heroic scores and anti-Semitic sentiments
made him an emblem of German nationalism. For a choreographer who
is black and openly gay, it was not an obvious choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated Wagner before this piece, and everything I know about
him as a person I find offensive,'' Rousseve said in an interview
last month. ``So I was absolutely appalled at myself when I came to
adore his operas.'' Even now he wonders, ``How could someone who
was such a beast write such sublime music?''
</P>
<P>
   Such seeming contradictions are a recurring theme in ``Love
Songs,'' which will be performed Wednesday through Saturday at the
academy's Harvey Theater. As before, Rousseve weaves family
history, cultural criticism and surreal stagecraft into an
emotionally charged postmodern epic. The piece is a loose retelling
of ``Tristan und Isolde,'' Wagner's fatally erotic opera about a
couple of Celtic royals.
</P>
<P>
   Now set in the antebellum South, its main story line follows two
slaves, John and Sarah, whose forbidden love slides back and forth
between bondage and freedom, faith and doubt, day and everlasting
night.
</P>
<P>
   Rousseve said ``Love Songs'' has changed the way he works with
music, making his choreography less intuitive. Before creating a
dance called ``Simple Gifts'' last August for the Houston Ballet,
for example, he spent three months poring over the sheet music for
Aaron Copland's ``Appalachian Spring'' _ ``working note for note so
if I go against it I know exactly where and why,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he asked the pianist Eddie Palmieri for a written
score before making ``Somethin' From Nothin','' which Ballet
Hispanico is performing this week at the Joyce Theater.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Love Songs,'' the trickiest dance sequence is a dense
ensemble that the troupe referred to in rehearsal as ``the
percolator.'' Like coffee burbling in a hot pot, the dancers
circulate in tight proximity, shifting their weight and changing
partners with great rapidity.
</P>
<P>
   Rousseve said the challenge, apart from simply avoiding
collisions, is to arrive in the right place at the right time with
the right emotional tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, a lot of my choreography has been dictated by how
high you can throw your partner,'' Rousseve said. ``Here it's how
wide can you open your sternum, how much can your weight drop, how
vulnerable can you be to your partner?''
</P>
<P>
   Joining his seven-member troupe is an ensemble of 21 local
actors and dancers who flesh out a couple of scenes and give the
piece an operatic scale. Rousseve, who dances in several scenes,
remains on stage throughout the production as the narrator. But
even in that role he takes on 10 different personae, ranging from
homespun Southerners like Grady McRady and Aunt Ruby to an urban
crackhead who takes his spiritual compass from ``The Wizard of
Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   The musical score is equally varied. Along with the Wagner,
Rousseve borrows parts of piano concertos from Chopin and Schumann,
the Humming Chorus from Puccini's ``Madama Butterfly'' and _ most
boldly _ the Swan section from Saint-Saens' ``Carnival of the
Animals.''
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast to Anna Pavlova's legendary dance of the dying
swan in a feathery white tutu, the signature solo created for her
nearly a century ago by the Russian choreographer Michel Fokine,
Rousseve has Kyle Sheldon perform in nothing more than a gas mask.
Rousseve described it as a dark divertissement about death and
resurrection and ``a comment about being alone that gets at the
spiritual subtext.''
</P>
<P>
   Rousseve, who turned 40 two weeks ago, has been traversing
cultural divides all his life, a pattern he traced his family tree.
His mother's mother was a Creole maid who never finished first
grade, while his father's father was a classical organist who
earned a doctorate in history.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Houston, Rousseve was bused across town to
integrated schools, where he was the only boy in his dance class.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as an undergraduate at Princeton University, he
vacillated between pursuing a career in the performing arts or
civil rights law. He ended up writing his thesis on political
theater in South Africa and, after graduating magna cum laude in
1981, set out for New York.
</P>
<P>
   Soap opera cameos and late-night paralegal work paid the rent
until he joined Toronto Dance Theater, where he performed in
expressionist pieces derived from the technique of Martha Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more influential, he said, was a stint just out of
college with Jean Erdman's Theater of the Open Eye in Manhattan.
Ms. Erdman, who had danced with Graham and was married to the
mythologist Joseph Campbell, inspired him with a mixed-media
approach that she called ``total theater'' _ echoing Wagner's
concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk, or total work of art.
</P>
<P>
   That approach has become a hallmark of Rousseve's troupe,
Reality, which he founded in 1989. The name signaled his
frustration with contemporary dance, whose abstractions seemed to
miss the essential truths of his world, from the vitality of Zydeco
music to the injustice of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   If the first rule for a writer is to write about what you know,
then certainly that has to be true for a choreographer as well,''
Rousseve said. For him, that meant exploring social issues and
finding a credible way to combine high and low culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to create agitprop,'' he said. ``I wanted to
find a way to create work that was artistically viable and
successful, but also spoke on a breadth of issues that addressed
humanity. To do that, I think the work has to be vulnerable,'' by
which he meant that it should honestly reflect the artist's
emotional concerns and personal history.
</P>
<P>
   After spending most of his adult life in New York, Rousseve was
lured away three years ago by a tenured position at the Department
of World Arts and Cultures at the University of California at Los
Angeles. He sits on an interdisciplinary faculty that includes the
director Peter Sellars, the muralist Judy Baca and the
anthropologist Peter Nabokov.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Songs,'' which had its premiere last year in Chicago,
reflects Rousseve's postmodern sensibility. On the one hand, he
equates Wagner with brutality by juxtaposing the robust Pilgrims'
Chorus from ``Tannhauser,'' which was conceived as an evocation of
saintly love, with the beastial image of Sarah being raped by her
master.
</P>
<P>
   Later he drops the irony and admits his qualified admiration for
the composer by using the Prelude from ``Tristan'' to depict John
and Sarah's insatiable longing. And at the transcendent climax, the
lovers reunite to the quintessentially erotic aria from
``Tristan,'' the Liebestod.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of romanticism in the piece, but the chord that
it strikes is atonal and bittersweet,'' Rousseve said. ``The theme
is that a little bit of compassion or love is what gets us through
the muck, but certainly the piece also looks at the muck. I think
it strikes a hopeful chord about the timelessness of what's
essentially a dehumanizing existence.''

SPANISH MOVIES MINE A RICH VEIN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VALERIE GLADSTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Until Pedro Almodovar's first zany comedy ``Pepi,
Luci, Bom ...'' in 1980, Spanish films rarely caused a stir. Then
came his hit ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' in 1988.
His latest, ``All About My Mother,'' which opened here last month
and in Europe six months ago, is topping his previous box-office
records. But Almodovar is just one of many Spanish directors who
are making waves.
</P>
<P>
   At the Film Society of Lincoln Center, Richard Pena, the program
director, began tracking the Spanish film revival in 1992 when he
inaugurated the first Spanish film festival in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we began, it was at a low point,'' Pena said recently.
``Now it's become one of the strongest in Europe. Along with Iran,
Spain makes the most interesting films today.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Friday, 18 independent films, most of them American
premieres, will be presented through Dec. 24 at the Walter Reade
Theater by the Film Society, in collaboration with the Instituto
Cervantes, which supports Spanish culture abroad, the Spanish
Society of Authors and Publishers, and the Spanish Ministry of
Education and Culture.
</P>
<P>
   The featured director, Ventura Pons, 54, will be represented by
six films, among them the probing drama ``Beloved/Friend''
(``Amic/Amat''), a prize winner at the recent Berlin Film Festival,
and his first film, ``Ocana, Intermittent Portrait'' (1978), a
documentary about a famous Barcelona transvestite.
</P>
<P>
   Made in his native Catalan language, these films are among
several from three distinctive regions of Spain _ Catalonia,
Andalusia and the Basque country. Regional film production is
another growing trend in the industry. The festival also brings
back Ivan Zulueta's 1979 cult classic ``Rapture'' (``Arrebato''),
an off-beat vampire tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The series should give a real snapshot of Spanish cinema,''
said Pena, adding that every year a few more films from the
festival are picked up for commercial distribution. Samuel Goldwyn
Films has already acquired Benito Zambrano's ``Alone'' (``Solas''),
to be shown in the United States next year.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-hitting, sophisticated and beautifully acted, the entries
cover the spectrum from Manuel Cusso-Ferrer's fantasy love story
``Babaouo,'' based on a 1932 scenario by Salvador Dali, to the
near-pornographic ``Between Your Legs'' (``Entre las Piernas'') by
Manuel Gomez Pereira, a director in the flashy, stylized manner of
Almodovar.
</P>
<P>
   The generational span is also broad. The eminent Carlos Saura,
67, renowned for his flamenco trilogy, ``Blood Wedding'' (1981),
``Carmen'' (1983) and ``A Love Bewitched'' (1986), and the recent
``Flamenco'' (1995), contributes ``Goya in Bordeaux,'' an eloquent
homage to his favorite painter, and the actress and director Iciar
Bollain, 32, offers ``Flowers From Another World'' (``Flores de
Otro Mundo''), a comedy concerning mail order brides in an isolated
Spanish village.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our filmmakers have moved away from the great transcendental
themes of Bunuel,'' said Maria Lozano, director of Instituto
Cervantes in New York, referring to Luis Bunuel, one of the
century's great directors, perhaps best known for ``The Andalusian
Dog'' (1928) and ``The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie'' (1972).
``And they no longer treat love and death in grandiose terms. By
treating everyday realities, they connect better with young
audiences. Whether for good or bad, we've become more European.''
It has been a long journey.
</P>
<P>
   During Francisco Franco's dictatorship, from 1937 until his
death in 1975, many of the subjects Spanish directors deal with now
_ homosexuality, racism, marital abuse and drug addiction _ were
forbidden. Moviegoers had to be satisfied with corny folklore
musicals or films that glorified Spain, although by the 1950s a few
directors had begun to successfully challenge the
ultra-conservative status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Bunuel, who died in 1983, retained his artistic integrity by
working in France and Mexico, while Saura, among others, adopted an
allegorical and metaphorical style to mask his themes, notably in
``The Chase'' (1965). Once freed of constraints, Spanish directors
often dedicated themselves to reconstructing the past, trying to
depict their history more authentically.
</P>
<P>
   So great was the need to resurrect the ``true'' Spain that 300
historical films were released between 1976 and 1982, more than
half of all Spanish films made during that period. Saura challenged
the idea of whether we could ever even know what is historically
true in ``Blindfolded'' (1978).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers born toward the end of the Franco era and afterward
did not share their elders' preoccupation with the past. Enamored
of Hollywood films, they adopted the American thriller, the film
noir and screwball comedy as models and made them their own.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing transformation of their cinema was also fueled by
economic exigencies. In 1994, the government changed its policy of
granting subsidies to projects it deemed of artistic merit to one
retroactively dependent on a film's success in the market place.
Now directors don't receive government money unless their films
attract an audience of about 70,000, a moderate number in Spain. As
a result, the industry reached its production nadir in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the savior: television. Today, 80 percent of Spanish film
production relies on co-financing arrangements with public and
private television stations, with the remaining 20 percent still
provided by government and private subsidies. But the stations,
too, expect the films they finance to have popular appeal, since a
television broadcast is part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In this new atmosphere, the industry is thriving. In 1998, Spain
produced 96 features, up from only 44 in 1994. What's more,
audiences have doubled, foreign distribution is up and,
increasingly, young Spaniards are choosing to become filmmakers. In
1995, the National Film School reopened after being closed for 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's film industry still lags behind its European
counterparts in production but not, crucially, in energy and
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Saura's passion for his trade has weathered the vicissitudes of
his country's film history. In fact, he first began thinking about
making his new film ``Goya in Bordeaux'' at the start of his career
in the '50s. ``Long ago, Goya inspired me with his statement, `I
don't see lines and colors, only shadows,''' Saura said. ``I wanted
to create his atmosphere in film. There's something strange and
mysterious that unites the greatest Spanish artists _ Goya,
Picasso, Bunuel. They all had enormous ego, strength, passion and
sensitivity. My next film will be about Bunuel.''
</P>
<P>
   Two themes run through most contemporary Spanish films _
personal responsibility and the difficulty of establishing honest
relationships. They are at the heart of Pons' ``Beloved/Friend,''
which documents the final days of a dying professor who wants to
leave his best friend a self-revealing essay. Frustrated in his
attempt, he finds that a young, sadistic, gay hustler may be his
only avenue to immortality. ``I show the struggle between
generations and how each grasps for its future,'' said Pons.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bollain and Antonio Hernandez, director of the thriller
``Lisbon,'' approach the same themes very differently. In her
poignant ``Flowers From Another World,'' three lively women from
Cuba, the Dominican Republic and the Spanish city of Bilboa seek
mates among the bachelors of a provincial town.
</P>
<P>
   A love story, it also addresses Spain's persistent racism.
Hernandez, a filmmaker for 20 years, pairs an embittered woman and
a cowardly salesman in a search for her husband's killer. While a
major studio asked Hernandez to rewrite the story in English and
direct it for American distribution, he declined. ``Why repeat
myself?'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Would he have been able to keep the original's inconclusive
ending? ``Oh, no,'' he said. ``That's another reason why I can't do
it. They wanted everything to work out fine.''

<P>
   I had no entrepreneurial ambitions until I came to America. I'd
love to say I was one of those kids who set up a lemonade stand or
had a paper route. But I didn't. I just wanted a job that paid more
than my dad earned as a civil servant in India. I came to America
in 1971 at age 22, got my MBA at Kent State University, worked for
a steel company in Ohio, then joined IBM as a salesman. After six
years, I said, OK, this is it, time to go back and resume my life
in India. But I was in love with a woman named Ruth, and it was
either Ruth or India. I was torn. I went back to India in order to
make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   By then, I had got the entrepreneurial bug. For a while, I
considered starting a computer-related company in India. Then I
asked: Why India? Why not go back to the United States, marry Ruth,
move to Silicon Valley and start a company? So I did. Marrying
Ruthie was the best decision I ever made. We now have a daughter,
17, and a son, 11. Moving to Silicon Valley was my second-best
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, I joined a Silicon Valley start-up that was an IBM
competitor. Then I tried to start my own company but couldn't get
any venture capitalists to fund me. So I joined a start-up called
Relational Software Inc., later to become Oracle Corp. I wrote
Oracle's first formal business plan in 1981 and ended up becoming a
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, I started Gupta Technologies, a provider of the world's
first client/server database software and tools for PCs. We went
public in 1993, and for a brief time the company was worth about
$400 million and a real hot IPO
</P>
<P>
   When the big boys like Microsoft and Oracle began competing
against us, I thought I could beat them at their game. I was wrong.
My dad once told me, ``No victory is final, and no defeat is
fatal.'' I hadn't paid attention. I thought my company's victory
when we went public was final.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, I've always been resilient. My mother always encouraged
me to question everything. When I was 11 or 12, I got into an
argument with a friend: ``Maybe there's no God,'' I said. He said
there must be a God because somebody had to create you, amoeba, the
world. I explained all this to my mother, and she told me to go ask
my friend who made God. After I became a father, the death of our
second child led me to reject my early skepticism and to believe
very firmly in God.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, I stepped away from Gupta Corp. It was one of the
toughest things I ever did. It was like losing a child. I took
several months off and traveled all across America with my family.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, I made an early investment in Keynote, when it was
still very small. A few months later the board asked me take over
as CEO. The last two years have been a blast.

CELLUCCI URGED TO DECLARE NEEDLE EMERGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a desperate attempt to slow what is now the leading
route of infection by the AIDS virus in Massachusetts _ intravenous
drug use _ nearly 800 doctors, nurses and others demanded Tuesday
that Gov. Paul Cellucci declare a public health emergency and
expand access to clean needles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts residents are dying,'' said Robert Greenwald,
director of public policy and legal affairs for the AIDS Action
Committee of Massachusetts, in a rally on the Statehouse steps
before the nearly 800 letters of protest were taken up to the
governor's office. ``This public health emergency demands an
immediate public health response.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is one of only 10 states that make it illegal to
possess a hypodermic needle without a prescription, and only four
communities have taken advantage of a state law that allows up to
10 communities to adopt pilot needle exchange programs, in which
drug users are given clean needles in exchange for used ones and
offered the opportunity to get into drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, between 53 to 58 percent of the people now living
with AIDS in New Bedford, Springfield and Worcester _ where efforts
to adopt needle exchange have been rejected _ contracted the virus
through IV drug use, according to the latest public health
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in Boston, which has had a needle exchange program
since 1994, only 29 percent of people living with AIDS were exposed
through IV drug use. The only other communities to adopt needle
exchange are Northampton, Provincetown and Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   The transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, through IV
drug use disproportionately affects women and minorities _ either
as a result of being drug users themselves, or of being a partner
of one _ according to state and federal statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Ribeiro, 47, is one of those New Bedford residents living
with AIDS who contracted it through IV drug use. In an interview
after the rally, he said that after nearly a decade of his trying
to get a local needle exchange program adopted without success,
he's convinced it will take a declaration of a public health
emergency by Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just like to appeal to his humanity. The support is
out there, the medical community, the church community, the
families who have lost people,'' said Ribeiro, who has been
drug-free for 10 years, and founded Treatment on Demand Inc. in New
Bedford to advocate for expanded drug treatment resources.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Tina T. Saxon of Disciples Baptist Church, who has
recently voiced concerns at black churches in the Boston area about
the AIDS epidemic, agreed. ``People are dying. People are dying
from this disease at every economic level, at every age level,''
said Saxon, who was not at the Statehouse rally, but attended
another rally Tuesday night on the eve of World AIDS Day in Roxbury
instead. ``It should be a national emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, during an unrelated news conference Tuesday, responded
to AIDS activists by citing several state programs that help combat
the epidemic _ including his administration's recent expansion of
Medicaid coverage to people who are infected with HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS, and not just those who have been diagnosed with
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's necessary to declare a public health
emergency. I think we have stepped up to the plate and will
continue to step up to the plate for those people who have AIDS and
those who are HIV-positive,'' said Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he pointed out that the state began the pilot
needle exchange programs with the stipulation that they have
community approval. ``We'll continue to be supportive as long as
it's something the local community wants.''
</P>
<P>
   David Amaral of the Christian Coalition of Massachusetts, who
helped lobby against a needle exchange program in New Bedford, said
it's clear the community there doesn't want the program, based on a
referendum defeating it. He said in an interview that he opposes
issuance of clean needles because it would ``enable'' IV drug
users.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do they do with these clean needles? Inject themselves
with illegal, dangerous life-ruining drugs. It's like handing out
nips of Southern Comfort to alcoholics,'' in the hope that they
will not buy large amounts of the liquor and ``drink themselves
into an alcoholic coma or death,'' said Amaral, who is field
director for the coalition in Southeastern Massachusetts. ``It just
doesn't make sense. It flies in the face of common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Other opponents of needle exchange have cited concerns about
increases in crime and IV drug use. But supporters of clean needle
programs cite studies showing that they reduce the spread of HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS, and get more people into treatment,
without increasing crime and drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needle exchange programs are not giving anybody drugs and
injection equipment they don't already have,'' said the Rev. Jon
Fuller, a Jesuit priest and an AIDS doctor, who spoke at the rally
Tuesday. ``It's not a small public health issue. It's about saving
hundreds of lives a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the state declared a public health emergency was
in the early 1990s, under then-Gov. William Weld, after a western
Massachusetts town's water supply was contaminated, according to
David Mulligan, who was state public health commisioner at the time
and is now an associate professor at Stonehill College. The
declaration allowed the state to use a privately owned quarry for a
temporary water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Boston needle exchange program began in 1994, more
than 3,000 people have been enrolled, and nearly a quarter of them
have been referred to drug treatment programs, according to
statistics from the city's public health commission.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, N.Y. _ It can be worth as much as gold, and it grows.
</P>
<P>
   It is American ginseng, a cousin of the aromatic root that has
been used by Asians for thousands of years to treat problems
including headaches, diabetes and declining male potency.
</P>
<P>
   And one man here in the shadows of the Catskills 120 miles north
of Manhattan, where the root grows wild on the forest floor,
believes that it could be the remedy for the financial headaches of
upstate farmers and other landowners.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Beyfuss, a Cornell Cooperative Extension agent in Greene
County, is on a crusade to make fallow fields and woodlands
profitable by persuading people to grow the wild version of
American ginseng. The dried root can fetch $1,000 a pound on the
worldwide market.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, Beyfuss has organized the 170-member
Empire State Ginseng Growers Association. He is planning an
International Ginseng Conference in Greene County next September to
share information on growing the plant, whose recorded history in
New York state dates to the early 1700s, when a Jesuit missionary
noted its use by Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Ginseng's missionary is a gray-haired 49-year-old who speaks in
fluid cadences that he put to good use in the early 1980s, when he
was host of a farm program on a Schenectady television station. Two
guests told him about the Catskills' fame among lovers of ginseng.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has taken ginseng to reduce stress during a
divorce, to lose weight and to increase his brain power for
graduate work. He has hunted the root, grown it, bottled it for
friends as Dr. Bob's Ginseng Elixir, and written a master's thesis
on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am haunted by ginseng,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So, it seems, are many others. In the last decade, as interest
has grown in alternative medicine, many Americans have started
taking it in pills, drinking it in tea and eating the root raw for
many of the same health reasons that Asians take it.
</P>
<P>
   Most ginseng, known as field-cultivated ginseng, comes from
China and Korea, where it is grown in raised beds under shade cloth
and heavily dosed with pesticides and fertilizers. In North
America, the major producers of field-cultivated ginseng are in
Wisconsin, Ontario and British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   But for aficionados, Asian or American, the most prized and
potent ginseng grows wild. Those rare roots grow in the Catskills,
where the herb is referred to as ``shang.'' It is eagerly sought by
shang hunters, who jealously guard their favorite secret hunting
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   American ginseng, Panax quinquefolium, ranges from Quebec to
Georgia, and from the East Coast to Iowa. It thrives in the heavy
shade of deciduous trees. But the most potent wild ginseng, Beyfuss
says, grows in Vermont and New York, especially in the Catskills,
which have the best conditions: crisp winter weather and the right
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Although 90 percent or more of the $1 billion world market is
for the field-cultivated plant, the wild version is worth up to 30
times as much, with cultivated ginseng selling for $10 to $15 a
pound and fresh wild ginseng averaging $300 a pound. It is not
unknown for dried wild ginseng to retail for $1,300 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   One small wild root, if it is old enough and resembles an
anatomically correct man, including sex organs, can be sold for up
to $500 in Hong Kong to those who use it as an aphrodisiac. ``The
more ginseng resembles a human figure, the more valuable it is,''
Beyfuss said.
</P>
<P>
   The wild root's sometimes eerie resemblance to a human perhaps
explains why the Chinese word for ginseng means ``man root.''
Field-cultivated ginseng looks more like a pale carrot than like a
human.
</P>
<P>
   The rising value of wild ginseng has led Beyfuss and others to
explore ways to grow ginseng by simulating wild conditions; gently
scratching the ground under the branches of a mature shade tree,
and dropping the seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ginseng loves sugar maples,'' said Scott Harris of Otsego
County, who is president of the state's Ginseng Growers Association
and, with his wife, Sylva, the proprietor of Sylvan Botanicals,
near Cooperstown. The association's members include 30 growers of
simulated wild ginseng, like the Harrises, as well as a dozen
cultivators of field-grown ginseng. The rest grow it as a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But before Beyfuss could recommend that others take up the
farming of wild ginseng, he had to learn its secrets, with the
unlikely aid of the wary shang hunters. The wild ginseng is a
protected species, and so by state law may only be picked from
Sept. 1 through Nov. 30. Beyfuss and other hunters are dropped off
in the woods and picked up after harvesting is done, so their
parked cars do not reveal the locations of their treasure troves.
</P>
<P>
   Beyfuss says he is a shang hunter, but not a very successful
one. So he devised a way to extract the information he needed from
the best shang hunters without requiring them to reveal where they
dug.
</P>
<P>
   Shang dealers, who are registered with the state, provided
Beyfuss with the hunters' names. He then sent out a simple
questionnaire in postage-paid envelopes, asking for soil samples
from places where the hunter found good wild ginseng, and for
information about the area where it grew, including nearby trees,
and slope and exposure of the land.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-1990s, Beyfuss got back 100 questionnaires and
soil samples in paper bags and old socks, and was able to piece
together a profile of the kind of soil _ high in calcium,
relatively high in acidity _ that Catskill wild ginseng prefers.
Armed with this knowledge, he devised a checklist that he handed
out to potential growers to determine the best places to sow seeds.
</P>
<P>
   If simulated wild ginseng takes root, it could prove a valuable
resource to Greene County landowners who are struggling to pay
property taxes. The number of working farms in the county has
fallen sharply in the last two decades. In 1977, when Beyfuss
arrived in Greene County, it had 120 full-time dairy farms; today,
it has 27. Many longtime residents had sold their property, and 53
percent of the land in the county is now owned by nonresidents.
</P>
<P>
   Harris calculates that one acre of simulated wild ginseng could,
after several years of growth, be worth up to $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   If Beyfuss' efforts work, he will not only make unused farmland
and woodlots profitable again, but also please those who are trying
to protect New York City tap water. Growing ginseng is one of the
strategies the Watershed Agriculture Council in Delaware County is
examining to protect the city's watershed, of which much of the
Catskills are a part, from pesticides and other harmful runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Forest land is economically unviable, said Alan White, executive
director of the council, because property taxes can be four or five
times higher than the revenue it produces. The council, through the
Forest Service, has awarded Beyfuss grants to encourage the
production of simulated wild ginseng, which does not require
tilling, fertilizers or pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   But for Beyfuss, the bigger challenge will be to sell the idea
of wild ginseng to drugstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 15 products for sale in the Rite Aid in Cairo that
contain Asian ginseng,'' he said. ``That ticks me off. If our
ginseng is so good, so fine, why can't we buy American ginseng in
this country? You can't.''

RESEARCHERS RECOMMEND SECOND OPINIONS IN BIOPSIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patients have long been told to seek a second opinion from an
examining doctor, but they also should ask for a second review on
laboratory readings by pathologists to prevent the wrong treatment,
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 6,171 cancer patients referred to Johns Hopkins
Medical Institutions in Baltimore, researchers found 86 patients,
or 1.4 percent, who initially had a ``totally wrong'' diagnosis
after a biopsy result, said Dr. Jonathan Epstein, professor of
pathology, urology, and oncology at Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   If the reading is wrong, ``you can go to the best clinician, but
have the wrong treatment,'' said Epstein, an author of a report on
the study in the current issue of Cancer.
</P>
<P>
   One patient was supposed to have his middle ear removed because
the first diagnosis was cancer of the ear canal. But the second
pathology report at Hopkins found the patient to have a fungal
infection that could respond to medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The review at Hopkins revealed false positives, conditions
misdiagnosed as cancer. False negatives are cancerous tissues that
are misidentified as non-cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein and his colleagues compared the original pathologists'
reports that patients brought to Hopkins to the reports done by
Hopkins pathologists on the same patients. In 23 percent of the
suspect cases, patients' diagnoses changed from ``decidedly''
malignant to benign, Epstein said. Past studies of this problem
have focused on a specific cancer, but this study looked at all
types of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marshall Posner, medical director of head and neck oncology
at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said the study by
Epstein and his colleagues was the ``first official record of what
we have all known.''
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes could not be predicted by the size of the hospital or
the level of experience of its physicians, Epstein said. Some
mistakes came from community hospitals, and others from teaching
hospitals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Between January 1995 and December 1997, two pathologists at
Sturdy Memorial Hospital in Attleboro, Mass. allegedly misread 20
biopsies on 19 patients with prostate cancer, saying they were free
of cancer. Sturdy Memorial discovered the errors after a urologist
found that one of his patients had been misdiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital now has biopsies reviewed by two pathologists,
instead of one.
</P>
<P>
   Because of situations like Sturdy's, Epstein recommends
institutions set up policies requiring a review of the original
biopsies before patients undergo surgery or other major therapy.
Patients can also ask their clinicians to send their biopsies to
another pathologist for review.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein, who reviews 4,500 prostate cases annually from other
pathologists, said that the rate of false negatives at Sturdy was
higher than he would have expected, but he noted that prostate
cancer is one of the hardest to diagnose.
</P>
<P>
   At Dana-Farber, incoming patients' biopsy readings are reviewed
by Dana-Farber's own pathologists because 3 to 5 percent of
diagnoses are changed, said Posner.
</P>
<P>
   But Posner disagrees that all biopsy results warrant a second
pathology opinion. ``Can it be done in a way to maximize the
return? The most standard tumors, such as invasive breast cancer,
don't need to be reviewed again. I don't want the public to panic
about all pathology reviews.''

FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON, 49ERS PLAY FOR PRIDE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It isn't like Jim Mora blows his cork on
national television all the time, and it isn't like he'll get many
chances to do it again soon.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after the January 3 game between the 49ers and Falcons
in Atlanta, Mora, the defensive coordinator of the San Francisco
Close Cover Before Striking, is going to have to change jobs to see
the business end of a ``Monday Night Football'' game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there he was on the sideline as Green Bay's Tyrone Davis
lumbered into the end zone with the Packers' second touchdown,
unencumbered as he was by any visible 49er presence.
</P>
<P>
   And Mora bent a piston rod right then and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe this!'' he yowled, an easy lip-read for even
the least attentive of football fans. ``What the ----?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Mora knew very well what had happened. Linebacker
Winfred Tubbs hadn't made a fairly basic adjustment to the Packers'
formation on the second-down play from the San Francisco 10, and
Davis, an otherwise little-known tight end from Virginia, bustled
into the end zone with what proved to be a very extraneous score.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, though, it should be said that it was actually
Green Bay's first score, a 13-yard pass from Brett Favre to Corey
Bradford, that was the game-winner, because Mora knows, as we all
do, that the opponents' first touchdown is by definition the
game-winner with the offense the 49ers are churning out these days.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it was the aesthetics of Davis' touchdown that tore at
Mora's already raw sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't have happened,'' he said flatly. ``The thing is,
we know there's so little margin for error right now, and to make a
mistake like that on something so easy... well, it's just not
excusable.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora didn't say any of this in anger. He had expended his anger
with that Bulgarian folk song he emitted as Davis bundled himself
into the end zone. Besides, what was there to do about it? Oh sure,
he could flog the miscreant in the Tuesday film session, but the
deed had been done. The 49ers had lost convincingly yet again, and
even though Mora's defense had held its own against Favre's
improvisational gifts, the fact is that 20 is too many points.
</P>
<P>
   No, the fact is that seven is too many points against the 49ers
these days, and it isn't going to change between now and Draft Day.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 49ers lost two more cornerbacks Monday night, the
much maligned R.W. McQuarters to a fractured right collarbone and
the so-far unnoticed Monty Montgomery to a fractured right radius
(near the elbow). Thus, Mora's mood figured to be a little grim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the plan is now,'' he said, although he did
say that Darnell Walker and Ramos McDonald would probably start
Sunday in Cincinnati. ``I'm sure Bill (Walsh) and Terry (Donahue)
will come up with something. I know we have to do something fast.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, there isn't much voodoo Walsh and
Donahue can do, other than activate Wasswa Serwanga and Craig
Newsome from the just-watching list. And let's face it, they're
just names replacing other names at this point. Among other things,
neither of them shows any interest in playing offense.
</P>
<P>
   Which is quite a coincidence when you consider those who
actually play on the offensive side of the ball. The 49ers played
about as well as they can defensively the last two weeks, and it
made no more difference than if they had allowed 650 yards. The
49ers got their three points early, and came dangerously close to
actually attaining double figures for the first time in over a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah. Like it mattered.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, a fourth 49er win this season is nearly
inconceivable, and it is surely a fact that the employees are
playing only to like what they see when they shave on Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   It seems equally odd to consider Mora's position. His side of
the ball is doing reasonably well now after the tortures of
October, and it's still two touchdowns short every week.
</P>
<P>
   As we remember from the acrid fumes of the chemical fire that
was October and the first half of November, the defense was a
thorough shambles, incapable of stopping anyone from doing anything
at any time for any reason. Mora heard things his father Jim, Sr.,
didn't hear even in his last strange days in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerbacks were perfectly dreadful. There was no pass rush.
The linebackers were being moved pretty much at will. They allowed
20 touchdowns in four games, a ridiculous figure even by Pac-10
standards.
</P>
<P>
   So now the defense has gotten at least nominally better, just as
the offense has completely imploded, leaving the same result, the
same margin of defeat, the same feeling of inescapable doom.
</P>
<P>
   In Indianapolis, Jim Mora, Sr., is so happy with his Colts that
he doesn't get flustered when a backdrop falls against the back of
his head. Two years ago, he fled the Big Easy after a series of
defeats that left him uttering phrases like ``diddley-poo'' in
public.
</P>
<P>
   His son, on the other hand, was safe and learning the business
with the most successful team of the last two decades. Now he is
secure only with the knowledge that the 49ers' ills have outgrown
his ability to affect meaningful change.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe that's what his Vesuvian outburst really was _ the
knowledge that the 49er defense put in a stomachable performance
Monday night, and the only thing people will remember is him
torquing himself into a snit after a meaningless touchdown in a
hopeless season.

BUSH EXPECTED TO SUPPORT REVAMP OF INCOME TAX SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Governor George W. Bush plans to announce
Wednesday that he has rejected the idea of a ``flat tax'' and
instead will propose a revamped income tax system with a top rate
of 33 percent and lower marginal rates for most taxpayers, a
campaign aide sayu.
</P>
<P>
   After months of internal campaign debate, Bush will unveil the
plan in Des Moines and hopes to trumpet it Thursday during his
first GOP presidential debate in Manchester, N.H. Some of Bush's
opponents have criticized him for failing to provide details of his
tax policy until now.
</P>
<P>
   The key feature of Bush's plan is reducing the current top tax
rate of 39.6 percent to 33 percent. In addition, the middle-income
tax rate of 28 percent would drop to 25 percent. Surprisingly, the
Republican presidential contender does not address whether he wants
to reduce capital gains taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, by contrast, has proposed a flat tax of 17
percent, and Gary Bauer has suggested a 16 percent plan.
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes, who also is seeking the GOP nomination, is likely
to criticize Bush's plan for not cutting taxes enough, Democrats
are expected to say it puts too much emphasis on helping the
wealthiest taxpayers. For example, only 1 percent of the taxpayers
would benefit from cutting the top tax rate, according to Robert
McIntyre, director of the labor union-backed Citizens for Tax
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre said the Bush plan ``is a pretty big tax cut for rich
people.'' McIntyre's initial analysis shows that the ``top 5
percent of taxpayers would get three-quarters of the benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign is focusing on the benefit to lower- and
middle-income taxpayers by providing examples of how the plan would
affect average families.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you earn $1 million, you get a big tax cut,'' another Bush
aide said. ``The governor plans to cut taxes for everybody from all
walks of life. The governor is not going to start carving people
out (of the tax cuts) just because they are successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign said that when various deductions are counted,
a family of four earning $35,000 a year would get a tax cut of
$1,500, and a family earning $50,000 would save $1,900 in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan sets out to make life better for average men women and
children,'' Bush says, according to the draft of Wednesday's
speech.
</P>
<P>
   To put the Bush plan in perspective, the proposal would cost
$483 billion over five years. While it is difficult to compare the
cost of tax plans without knowing all the details, that amount
falls between the estimated $1.5 trillion cost of the Forbes plan
and the $156 billion tax cut proposal unsuccessfully put forward
this year by congressional Republicans, McIntyre said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan would also provide a number of increased tax
deductions. For example, Bush plans to double the child tax credit
to $1,000 and to increase the allowable annual contribution to
educational savings accounts to $5,000 from $500. Bush also
proposes expanding the use of the education accounts not just for
college but also to pay for private elementary and secondary
schooling.

   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Patriots safety Lawyer Milloy shed more
light Tuesday on incidents between him and teammate Vincent Brisby
at suburban Boston restaurant last Wednesday and at practice the
following morning.
</P>
<P>
   Milloy said he regretted what happened at the Palace in Saugus,
but he also echoed the sentiments of team management that they have
received far too much scrutiny, given what actually happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret it because it got out in the public,'' said Milloy.
``Being one of the leaders of this team, I have to suffer the
consequences of it, but this is getting blown way out of
proportion. The way the media is talking about it, it's like
Lewis-Holyfield or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy said he arrived to teammate Willie McGinest's ``Big
Brother'' charity event at the Palace with a woman at about 11:30
p.m. in a limousine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't been there more than 15 minutes and I was sitting
there and all of a sudden Brisby had me in a headlock,'' said
Milloy. ``I pushed him and then all my teammates started to grab us
and break it up. I know Rod Rutledge pulled me away and held me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out later from Briz that he was just playing. I didn't
know it while it was happening, so I reacted. I don't know where
this stuff about the pool sticks came from. I played baseball, so
if I had a pool stick in my hand I could do some damage. That's
completely false.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Brisby approached Milloy before practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't had a chance to discuss it and resolve it, so that
morning he came over and started pushing me,'' said Milloy. ``It
was broken up right away by our teammates. Neither time did it ever
get out of hand. Neither one of us got hurt. We're fine. It's way
past us. It's not even an issue with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier said
coach Pete Carroll imposed fines but reports of a $5,000 figure for
each player were ``too high.''
</P>
<P>
   WBZ-TV in Boston reported Tuesday that a woman who was at the
club suffered a gash above an eye as a result of the scuffle. That
surprised Milloy. ``I don't recall seeing another woman in that
area other than the one I was with, and she brought me home,'' said
Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   Milloy also said he and Brisby often engage in horseplay on the
practice field.
</P>
<P>
   While Grier didn't appreciate the players acting as they did in
public, he said, ``What happens is when we're going bad, it's
newsworthy. We're not playing very well. Everything is magnified.
After the incident, both guys played hard and both guys handled it
well. There were no repercussions.''
</P>
<P>
   The second part of the story _ Terry Glenn being stopped by
police for speeding at 4 a.m. and subsequently being late for
practice _ also needs clarification.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have a copy of Glenn's citation, and it says that
he was stopped at 8:30 a.m., not 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who reportedly was helped to a limousine after drinking
too much after the Palace event, was already an hour late for a
team meeting the next morning when he got stopped, so he wound up
being two hours late.
</P>
<P>
   As a disciplinary measure, Carroll benched Glenn for the first
quarter of Sunday's 17-7 loss in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, from owner Bob Kraft on down, view last week's
incident in Saugus as regrettable because it occured at a charity
event. But after an investigation, the team concluded that the
squabble at the Palace and the follow-up altercation between Milloy
and Brisby on Thanksgiving were minor in nature.
</P>
<P>
   They do not reflect a ``lack of control'' by Carroll in
management's eyes. Anyone who was around the team during the Bill
Parcells era recalls a vicious fight between McGinest and Ferric
Collons, and other lesser skirmishes among players.
</P>
<P>
   According to Grier, the incidents have not detracted from team
preparation. The Patriots, after three straight losses to
divisional opponents, need to spend the week getting in sync,
particularly on offense.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft is in no hurry to fire Carroll, despite the team's slump.
As he does in his other businesses, Kraft will evaluate things when
the year is over, but bringing in a new coach isn't high on his
priority list.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Kraft is going to bat for Carroll, talking to him
almost every day to offer support. Grier said he, too, offers
support to Carroll on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots don't turn it around, Grier himself will be
under fire for drafting some unproductive players.
</P>
<P>
   But right now Kraft isn't panicking on his management team.

   Rep.  &UR; Matt Salmon &LR; , R-Ariz., has introduced the Don't Disturb My
Dinner Act, which would ban telemarketers from calling households
between 5 and 7 p.m. Current law forbids such calls before 8 a.m.
or after 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``These pesky telemarketers are invading people's privacy to

to put additional limits so they don't disrupt one of the most
important times that families enjoy together. As a father of four,
I get very guarded about my time with my children. The only time I
can guarantee we can be together is dinner time.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Y2K,'' the playwright Arthur Kopit's thriller about a computer
hacker who ruins a couple's life, opens on Tuesday in a Manhattan
Theater Club production at the Lucille Lortel Theater. Kopit and
Katie Hafner, who writes for the Circuits section of The New York
Times, exchanged e-mails about the play. Here are excerpts from
their correspondence. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KATIE HAFNER. How did you get the idea for ``Y2K''? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ARTHUR KOPIT. From thinking about the way Kenneth Starr was
pursuing Monica Lewinsky. Which is to say, I was not thinking about
computers at all but invasion of privacy. And I was feeling
outrage. And that outrage went completely off the charts when Starr
tried to subpoena records showing what books Monica Lewinsky had
bought. I thought, my God, there's no stopping him! If you're
looking for a real threat to our country, this is it. And that led
me to thinking about the ways all of us were vulnerable to such an
assault in the future and right now. And those thoughts led to this
play. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The technical language spewed by Astrakhan, the hacker, is
very impressive. Did you interview hackers?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Didn't need to. I found so much material on the Net _
interviews with hackers, articles written by hackers, profiles of
hackers, that getting the vocabulary right was not hard.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. And why the rather unusual name of Astrakhan for the hacker? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I modeled Astrakhan's renegade character, at least somewhat,
on a wildly unpredictable, deeply gifted student I once had in a
playwriting workshop I was giving. He was Armenian, or claimed he
was. After a while, I began to suspect he was also a terrorist. He
was a good reference point.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I chose Astrakhan because my wife had just bought an Astrakhan
hat, and the word jumped out at me. By the way, Astrakhan is not
his real name. I'm not sure what his real name is. In the world he
inhabits, no one knows his real name. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. He's the narrator in the play, which is intriguing because
he's a classic unreliable narrator.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The question of ``what is reliable information and what is
not'' is at the heart of the story. Generally, we assume that when
someone says something in a seemingly honest way, it's true _ or at
least what that person thinks is true. I wanted to play with that
idea to such a degree that the audience would suddenly understand
that what they had been accepting as true was in fact totally in
question.
</P>
<P>
   Because that's what happens to Joseph at the end, isn't it?
Almost overnight, his whole world has become unreliable. And I
wanted my audience to experience his state of shock.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you had any experiences like this yourself, especially
when it comes to electronic information?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Fortunately, no. I did get a virus though, and inadvertently
sent it on. Then I realized I was ``infected'' and had to tell
everyone I had been in contact with. And found it a bit
embarrassing. I mean, this really is sexual. Not literally, of
course, but close. So, in that trivial way _ my virus was the
equivalent of a minor cold _ I saw how easily one's entire life
could be undone, the way a common cold can turn into pneumonia. And
kill you. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The play is erotic, from beginning to end. Why did you infuse
it with so much eroticism?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I wanted the audience to be not only Joseph, watching his
world collapse, but Astrakhan, on the hunt, powerful, almost
invulnerable, and that meant having them experience the erotic
thrill Astrakhan gets from invading Joseph's privacy. It's really a
rape, isn't it? For which, by the way, he'll never get punished,
even if he's caught. Because the National Security Agency will hire
him. Or Microsoft. Because he's that good at this.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I noticed that the Y2K computer glitch itself is hardly
mentioned at all in the play. Why the title?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm using Y2K metaphorically, hoping it will suggest the
deeper, more profound Year 2000 Problem: our potential loss of
personal and political freedom through technology. We depend on
these machines now for almost everything and are therefore
vulnerable in ways we have never been. Our view of what is real and
what is not, and what is inviolable and what is not, is going to
have to change. So will the way we see ourselves. In a very short
time, you'll be able to find out pretty much anything you want to
know about anyone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has this play made you less sanguine about the futur? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Actually, I don't think I look at it any one way. It's a
story isn't it _ what we're living? So I'm mostly curious. To see
how it's all going to play out. It's like a great epic drama. The
next act is about to begin. We're coming back from intermission all
abuzz. And we have absolutely no idea what we are going to see.
Scary thought. Exciting thought.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Speaking of intermissions, there isn't one in this play. Why
is that?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The play's intentions don't allow for one. I was in an
earthquake once, in Mexico, and it's startling how, instantly, what
you had always believed was solid turns out not to be. That's why
my play is so quick, and doesn't so much end as stop. It's about
the suddenness of it all.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the end, Astrakhan's motive for ruining these two people's
lives seems completely unclear.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not sure he has a motive other than gratification.
Anyway, I'm not sure how much we ever understand about motives. In
any case, a motive would have let us off the hook. But for those
who need motives, Astrakhan does give one. He says, ``I do it
because I can.'' It's one of the few places I think he's telling
the truth.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you think of the Internet? When did you first go
online?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I went online in a serious way at the end of the summer
before last, when I got the idea for this play. So I was a bit like
Joseph with computers. Which was good for the play, because my
inevitable mistakes I knew would be like his mistakes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I did crash my system during that time, which threw me no end,
because I had only a narrow window of time to write the play. I
spent three whole days talking to tech support people at IBM and
Microsoft, trying to figure out what I had done wrong so I could
get my computer working again. In the end, I had to reformat my
hard disk, erase everything and basically start over.
</P>
<P>
   And then I saw how I could turn those three terrible lost days
into three invaluable days of research. I simply used this incident
in the play. And what happened to me happens now to Joseph, and is
the pivotal event that allows Astrakhan to get in. That accident
speeded things along. So, at the moment, I'm happy with the
Internet. But that could end. I mean, it's not a solid
relationship.

   Rep.  &UR; Matt Salmon &LR; , R-Ariz., has introduced the Don't Disturb My
Dinner Act, which would ban telemarketers from calling households
between 5 and 7 p.m. Current law forbids such calls before 8 a.m.
or after 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``These pesky telemarketers are invading people's privacy to
begin with,'' Salmon told the Arizona Republic. ``I think we ought
to put additional limits so they don't disrupt one of the most
important times that families enjoy together. As a father of four,
I get very guarded about my time with my children. The only time I
can guarantee we can be together is dinner time.''

RELATIVES OF MISSING HOPE MASS GRAVE WILL HOLD ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico _ Among the dozens of spectators who
gathered Tuesday outside a dusty ranch and shooting range known as
the ``Hidden Treasure,'' Roman Alonso Aguilar stood humbly, holding
a faded, photocopied newspaper article about his younger brother,
Jose.
</P>
<P>
   In one frightful but unforgettable moment on May 22, 1997,
Alonso said, a pair of men in cowboy boots and hats burst into his
home in this northern Mexican city and took his 33-year-old brother
away. He hasn't seen or heard from him since.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mexican and American authorities dug through the earth
Tuesday at this ranch in search of a mass grave that is said to
hold the remains of 100 people, including nearly two dozen
Americans, Aguilar hopes to find an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to know something, anything about where he is,''
Roman, 36, said as officials continued their work less than 300
yards away. ``Our whole family has been searching all over for him,
including his 11 kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Working on a tip from a Mexican police informant, scores of US
and Mexican investigators have descended on this patch near the
border in search of the bodies of victims believed to have been
murdered by one of Mexico's largest and fiercest drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary joint effort among the FBI, the DEA and the
Mexican federal Attorney General's Office, forensic experts were
searching for mass graves at two ranches outside this city, which
sits across the Rio Grande from El Paso, Texas. Authorities said
they would be searching two other nearby sites.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo
estimated at least 100 bodies were buried in the graves, and that
22 of them could be US citizens. Some of the victims may include
former informants to authorities and maybe even US law enforcement
agents who have disappeared in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant FBI Director Thomas Pickard said in Washington that
investigators at the scene has recovered part of one body Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe these people were killed for their knowledge or for
being witnesses to drug trafficking endeavors,'' Pickard said.
``Most of the information we have shows these individuals were
buried there at least two to three years ago, so it's not a recent
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials were led to the ranches by a paid informant who
approached the FBI earlier this year. The informant reportedly took
and passed lie detector tests before agents decided to begin their
searches.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of armed soldiers dressed in black outfits and ski masks
surrounded one of the ranches on Monday night. Local media reported
that six people in the main house, five of them ranch workers and a
6-month-old baby, were taken into protective custody, before
investigators began their hunt for the grave.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, workers returned to the site, which sits on a desolate
stretch of highway across from junkyards about 10 miles south of
Ciudad Juarez, to continue the exhumations. Officials said it could
be about 30 days before any identifications could be made.
</P>
<P>
   If the tips prove fruitful, the graves could be an important _
if gruesome _ break for US and Mexican anti-narcotics
investigators, who for years have tried to gain additional leads
against the Juarez drug cartel, one of the dominant cocaine
shipping organizations in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   As the power of Colombian druglords has waned over the last 10
years because increased police pressure, they have been steadily
supplanted by Mexican groups. The amount of cocaine that now
crosses the US-Mexican border has tripled over the last decade,
according to the US Customs Service, to more than 1 million tons in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton said he had not received
confirmation that 22 Americans were among the suspected victims but
condemned the killings as ``a horrible example'' of the excesses of
Mexico's drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it reinforces the imperative of our trying not only to
protect our border but to work with the Mexican authorities to try
to combat these (drug cartels),'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the border center of Ciudad Juarez has been the base
for the Juarez cartel, a drug gang formerly run by Amado Carrillo
Fuentes. Carrillo was the country's No. 1 cocaine trafficker before
he died in 1997 following complications from plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of his death, many residents and local officials
say, hundreds of people were kidnapped, tortured or killed in the
city in what police believe was at least in part a battle for
control of the cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of many of the victims, like Aguilar, said their pleas
to local and state police officials go unanswered, perhaps because
many of the officers themselves work for the cartel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know why our police never mobilized to help us look
for (our brother),'' Aguilar said as his eyes welled with tears.
``We can only think that they don't want to help us because they're
helping (the cartel).''
</P>
<P>
   The problem of kidnappings and unexplained murders has become so
frequent in Juarez that relatives of missing people have formed
their own association, which is based in El Paso and has been
prompting authorities on both sides of the border for years to take
action.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime F. Hervella, the association's director, said that since
the group formed in 1997, there have been 196 cases of missing
people, roughly 500 execution-style murders and 198 young women who
have been killed in Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the impotence of the (Mexican) authorities to
investigate these tragedies which has brought us to this kind of
situation,'' Hervella said Tuesday. ``How can we believe that
graves like this existed in our own backyard and no one knew
anything about it?''

HIGH COURT HEARS ARGUMENT ON LAW CURBING CABLE TV SEX CHANNELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (also see SCOTUS, about an abortion case)  
 (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration came before the Supreme
Court on Tuesday to defend a federal law aimed at shielding
households that do not subscribe to sexually explicit cable
television channels from receiving unwanted and incompletely
scrambled signals during hours when children might be watching.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which a special three-judge federal court struck down
last year on First Amendment grounds, requires any cable system
lacking the technology to scramble unwanted signals completely to
relegate sexually oriented programming to hours when children were
least likely to watch. The Federal Communications Commission
subsequently defined that ``safe harbor'' period as 10 p.m. to 6
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the justices appeared puzzled by the law, a provision
of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that was adopted as a floor
amendment, without any debate or congressional finding. They
questioned the extent of the technological problem, known as
``signal bleed,'' and wondered why, as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
put it, the government was acting as ``kind of a super parent''
rather than leaving it to parents who are concerned about the
problem to order blocking devices for their home television sets. A
parallel provision of the 1996 law requires cable systems to make
these devices available without charge upon request.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a question of each individual parent being able
to decide'' whether to take measures to block the blurred pictures
and muffled sounds from entering the home, said Assistant Solicitor
General James Feldman in reply to Ginsburg. He added that ``there's
a social interest'' in shielding children from the material and in
not interpreting parental inaction as authorization.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman said Congress had decided that such images were harmful
to children and that parents who nonetheless wanted their children
to see them should have to take the affirmative step of ordering
the sexually explicit programming. ``Consent should not be
inferred,'' Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   The law was challenged by the Playboy Entertainment Group, a
cable television spinoff of the magazine that picked up support for
its challenge from a wide array of media groups. A brief filed by
organizations representing booksellers, the movie industry, the
recording industry and others said that because ``the once discrete
worlds of print and electronic media are discrete no longer,'' the
Supreme Court should stop trying to calibrate different First
Amendment standards for different media.
</P>
<P>
   The court has not managed to define a constitutional standard
for review of government regulation of cable television, according
cable somewhat more protection than radio and broadcast television,
where regulations governing indecency have been upheld, and less
than the print media, where sexually explicit expression is fully
protected as long as it falls short of obscenity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In striking down the law last December, the special three-judge
U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., applied a high standard of
review and required the government to prove that the law was the
``least restrictive means'' of shielding children from the sexually
oriented programming. Because the blocking device was available to
those who wanted it, the time-of-day restriction, which limits
viewing even in homes with no children, was not the least
burdensome approach and so was unconstitutional, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy's lawyer, Robert Corn-Revere, described the law as ``a
case of regulatory overkill'' that restricted adults' access to
constitutionally protected speech. He said the problem of signal
bleed was tremendously variable, absent from some cable systems,
only intermittently present on others, depending on equipment and
sometimes on the weather. ``A blanket, across-the-board approach is
strikingly inappropriate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As cable systems switch from analog to digital equipment, the
problem is expected to disappear, but that could take 10 years or
more, according to briefs in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' responses to the arguments in the case ranged from
the theoretical to the intensely practical. When Corn-Revere said a
cable subscriber could order a blocking device with ``a simple
phone call,'' several justices wanted to know whether the
subscriber would then have to put up with the inconvenience of
waiting at home for a service call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all had to stay home to wait for repairmen who didn't
come,'' said Justice Stephen G. Breyer, adding almost under his
breath: ``The repairmen still don't come.'' His point was that the
blocking device, while free, could still be so inconvenient to
obtain that parents would not bother to order it. So for purposes
of shielding children from sexually explicit material, he said,
``it makes an enormous difference'' whether the law requires
parents to take some action, or whether it operates regardless of
what the parents do.
</P>
<P>
   Corn-Revere said that with current technology, subscribers could
install the devices on their own. Most of the 20 million to 30
million televisions sold every year now come with built-in
channel-blocking devices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The case, United States vs. Playboy Entertainment Group, No.
98-1682, presented the court with a provision of the same
telecommunications law that it confronted three years ago in a
landmark ruling on free speech on the Internet. That unanimous
decision, Reno vs. American Civil Liberties Union, struck down the
Communications Decency Act, a separate provision of the 1996 law
that made it a crime to send or display indecent material on the
Internet in a way that made it available to minors. The court said
the law's goal was laudable but that it threatened to suppress
protected speech among adults.

If L.A. adopts the ban, it would be the largest city to do so, on

DRUG KINGPIN PASSED ON RUTHLESS LEGACY UPON HIS DEATH, OFFICIALS
SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARISA TAYLOR 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amado Carrillo Fuentes, a Mexican drug kingpin whose domain
stretched for 200 miles along the Texas border, died in 1997, but
drug enforcement officials believe his legacy lives on.
</P>
<P>
   Before his death Fuentes, who operated primarily from Ciudad
Juarez across the Rio Grande from El Paso, tried to avoid the
scrutiny of authorities by killing his enemies and burying their
bodies, drug officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Juarez cartel adopted Fuentes' management style after his
death, drug enforcement agents said. Authorities Tuesday were
scouring four ranches outside Ciudad Juarez based on an informant's
tip that drug traffickers buried at least 100 bodies on remote
ranches in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way drug cartels operate is that if they want to escape
notice they dump bodies of their victims on private property,''
said Phil Jordan, a former drug enforcement agent who worked in El
Paso and Dallas. ``Amado Carrillo Fuentes tried to keep the
violence out of the public eye. He didn't leave bodies out
godfather style.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes, known as the Lord of the Skies for his use of Cessna
airplanes to carry drug loads, controlled a territory or ``plaza''
that stretched at least 200 miles through Chihuahua, Mexico, and
into Presidio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials believe his brother, Vicente, assumed
control of the Juarez cartel. Vicente Fuentes, who is still at
large, was indicted in September 1998 on drug-trafficking charges
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Jose Esparragosa-Moreno, known as ``El Azul,'' or the
Blue-Eyed One, also rose to power within the cartel, U.S. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   When a kingpin dies or is arrested, drug enforcement officials
say they have problems tracking who has assumed control over a
cartel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chaotic time,'' said Frank Seib, the acting special
agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration's office in
Dallas.''It can be hard to stay on top of intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   In the year after Amado Carrillo Fuentes' death, at least 176
homicides were linked to warring Mexican drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican drug traffickers began organizing into more efficient
cartels in the 1980s after agreeing to carry drug shipments for
Colombian drug cartels, Jordan said. With more at stake, leaders of
the cartels turned to violence to assert control over territory or
drug routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cartel leaders learn by trial and error,'' Seib said.''They
know that when you walk into a restaurant and kill 15 people that
it will attract attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Texans were horrified in 1985 by the torture and slaying of
Alberto Radelat of Fort Worth and John Walker, another American,
after they walked into a restaurant where the Guadalajara narcotics
cartel was meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Mexican authorities uncovered 12 bodies in Matamoros,
including the body of Mark Kilroy, a University of Texas student.
Authorities later linked the killings to a cult of drug traffickers
who believed that ritual sacrifices would protect them from
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The latest cycle of drug violence was triggered in the mid-1990s
by a struggle between rival drug traffickers, said Jorge Fernandez,
a columnist in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo and his chauffeur
were shot to death in their car outside the airport at Guadalajara,
Mexico, caught in what authorities believe was a gunbattle between
drug rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disappearances and killings escalated in 1993 and 1994 and
it has continued until now,'' Fernandez said.

   FORECAST-SOCAL (Los Angeles) _ After outperforming expectations
during 1999,Southern California's economy will grow at more modest
pace during the first part of the next century, according to a

   GHOST-EMPLOYEES (Los Angeles) _ The LAUSD's top investigator
said his findings of widespread employee timecard abuse and ``ghost
employees'' were only a preliminary glance at a problem he would
like to explore fully if he had enough money. Chief investigator
Don Mullinax said the intent of his confidential memo, obtained by
the Daily News, was to convince the district to dedicate more money
to rooting out abuse. On Tuesday, board member Caprice Young, head

Washington, D.C., on Mothers Day, May 14. Joining Feinstein at the
Sportsman's Lodge in Studio City are several mothers from Southern
California, including Joy Turner, whose 10-year-old son was gunned

   AMMO (Los Angeles) _ The Los Angeles Police Commission votes 3-2
on Tuesday to recommend a citywide ban on the sale of ammunition.
If L.A. adopts the ban, it would be the largest city to do so, on
the heels of Chicago and West Hollywood. But such a ban depends
partly on an expected ruling by the state Attorney General's Office
on the legality of such a policy by cities. In the meantime, the
Police Commission will forward its recommendation to the City
Council's Public Safety Committee, which wants to expedite it to
the full council. By Beth Barrett (Will move on the ``n''

SBC CONSIDERS ISSUING A TRACKING STOCK FOR ITS WIRELESS UNIT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SBC Communications Inc., the nation's largest local phone
carrier, is considering issuing separately traded tracking stocks
to follow the company's wireless communications unit and its
international operations, SBC said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company's management has not reached a final decision on
either initiative and has not presented them to the board for
formal consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Donald E. Kiernan, SBC's chief financial officer, said in an
interview yesterday: ``The valuations for those companies, for
stand-alone wireless operators, have grown dramatically over the
last several months _ some would say even beyond what any of us
have expected. We have a duty to our shareholders to consider all
options.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, according to Bloomberg News, Edward E. Whitacre
Jr., SBC's chairman, said before a speech in Boston: ``I've thought
about it. It's a good way to unlock value in some things.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiernan said that SBC _ which does business through the
Ameritech, Pacific Bell and Southwestern Bell telephone companies _
seriously considered a wireless tracking stock a few months ago,
but declined to move forward because issuing a tracking stock can
make it difficult for a parent company to work closely with the
unit being tracked.
</P>
<P>
   But as it became clear over the last several weeks that AT&AMP;T
intended to issue a tracking stock for its wireless operations and
as wireless stocks in general soared in value, ``we pulled off the
shelf some of those analyses,'' Kiernan said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's management intends to announce plans for a wireless
tracking stock at a meeting with analysts on Monday, according to
executives close to that company, the largest long-distance
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Kiernan declined to say how long it might take for SBC to reach
a decision on a wireless tracking stock. In Boston, Whitacre said
he was interested to ``see what happens with AT&AMP;T,'' according to
Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
   He said that any consideration of an international tracking
stock was less advanced than the internal discussions about the
wireless unit.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stocks are a relatively recent financial invention that
can allow companies to raise the visibility, and value, of their
far-flung subsidiaries without selling parts of those units. Hughes
Electronics, for instance, trades as a tracking stock of General
Motors, which owns Hughes. Hughes reports independent financial
results, but investors who buy Hughes shares do not actually
purchase a piece of the company, as they do when purchasing normal
common shares.
</P>
<P>
   Big, old telecommunications carriers like AT&AMP;T and SBC have been
known for being financially conservative, and it is unlikely that
either company would have seriously considered issuing a tracking
stock just a few years ago. But the Sprint Corp.'s success in
issuing wireless tracking shares last year appears to have prompted
them to reconsider.

JUDGE OKS DOW CORNING BREAST IMPLANT SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHERYL WADE and JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAY CITY, Mich. _ A federal judge approved a plan Tuesday to
allow Dow Corning Corp., to settle thousands of lawsuits brought by
women who claimed the firm's silicone breast implants caused them
serious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The implant plan is part of a larger $4.5 billion package
approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Spector designed to
allow Dow Corning to emerge from bankruptcy. The firm sought legal
protection in May 1995 because it couldn't cope with the onslaught
of lawsuits brought by women with implants.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan _ which is expected to be appealed _ Dow Corning
would pay a total of $3.2 billion to 170,000 women with silicone
breast implants. Another $1.3 billion would be used to pay other
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot ahead before any money is passed,''
Spector said during a 20-minute hearing. He called his ruling ``the
end to the first chapter.''
</P>
<P>
   Spector did not elaborate on how he ruled on various issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important day, one we've been looking forward
to for the last four and a half years,'' said Gary Anderson, Dow
Corning's president and chief executive officer. But, he conceded,
``it isn't the final, final day.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Houser, the lead attorney for Dow Corning, said Spector
approved the $4.5 billion plan that the company proposed last
November.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plan, women would receive between $12,000 and
$300,000, depending on the severity of their illnesses. Women could
receive up to $25,000 if their implants were found to have leaked
and ruptured. They can also receive $5,000 to have their implants
removed. The payments would be made over 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   If women accept the settlement they cannot sue Dow Corning or
its parents _ The Dow Chemical Co. or Corning Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Women who decide not to accept the settlement from Dow Corning
can sue the company in federal court in Detroit. Dow Corning will
set aside $400 million to pay for any cases they might lose.
</P>
<P>
   The company got out of the implant business in 1992 after the
Food and Drug Administration banned the use of silicone breast
implants on the ground that Dow Corning and other manufacturers
could not prove they were ``safe and effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result of the FDA's action, hundreds of thousands of
women sued Dow Corning _ once the world's largest manufacturer of
breast implants _ and other implant makers.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning was facing nearly 19,000 lawsuits when it filed for
bankruptcy in 1995. The other implant manufacturers, including
Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing Co. and Baxter Healthcare Corp.,
have since settled implant lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning has long maintained that implants cannot be linked
to disease and, indeed, recent scientific studies have found
implants do not cause serious disease such as cancer or lupus.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs dissatisfied with Spector's ruling were weighing
whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Geoffrey White, who represents 50 Nevada women with
implants, criticized part of the settlement plan that bars lawsuits
against Dow Chemical and Corning _ Dow Corning's parent companies.
He said the plan gives Dow Chemical a `` free ride'' and said he'd
take his challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. The
Nevada Supreme Court has ruled that Dow Chemical can be sued over
breast implant claims against Dow Corning.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers said they may appeals the $3.2 billion limit to
pay breast implant claims as well as the $400,000 limit to pay
women should they win jury trials.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is also weighing whether to appeal
Spector's ruling on the grounds that federal programs such as
Medicare _ which have paid for treatment of women with implants _
should be entitled to money.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bohan, representing the Department of Justice, said during
the hearing that the government wants the right to appeal on those
grounds.

BUSH EXPECTED TO SUPPORT REVAMP OF INCOME TAX SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Governor George W. Bush plans to announce
Wednesday that he has rejected the idea of a ``flat tax'' and
instead will propose a revamped income tax system with a top rate
of 33 percent and lower marginal rates for most taxpayers, a
campaign aide sayu.
</P>
<P>
   After months of internal campaign debate, Bush will unveil the
plan in Des Moines and hopes to trumpet it Thursday during his
first GOP presidential debate in Manchester, N.H. Some of Bush's
opponents have criticized him for failing to provide details of his
tax policy until now.
</P>
<P>
   The key feature of Bush's plan is reducing the current top tax
rate of 39.6 percent to 33 percent. In addition, the middle-income
tax rate of 28 percent would drop to 25 percent. Surprisingly, the
Republican presidential contender does not address whether he wants
to reduce capital gains taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, by contrast, has proposed a flat tax of 17
percent, and Gary Bauer has suggested a 16 percent plan.
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes, who also is seeking the GOP nomination, is likely
to criticize Bush's plan for not cutting taxes enough, Democrats
are expected to say it puts too much emphasis on helping the
wealthiest taxpayers. For example, only 1 percent of the taxpayers
would benefit from cutting the top tax rate, according to Robert
McIntyre, director of the labor union-backed Citizens for Tax
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre said the Bush plan ``is a pretty big tax cut for rich
people.'' McIntyre's initial analysis shows that the ``top 5
percent of taxpayers would get three-quarters of the benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign is focusing on the benefit to lower- and
middle-income taxpayers by providing examples of how the plan would
affect average families.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you earn $1 million, you get a big tax cut,'' another Bush
aide said. ``The governor plans to cut taxes for everybody from all
walks of life. The governor is not going to start carving people
out (of the tax cuts) just because they are successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign said that when various deductions are counted,
a family of four earning $35,000 a year would get a tax cut of
$1,500, and a family earning $50,000 would save $1,900 in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan sets out to make life better for average men women and
children,'' Bush says, according to the draft of Wednesday's
speech.
</P>
<P>
   To put the Bush plan in perspective, the proposal would cost
$483 billion over five years. While it is difficult to compare the
cost of tax plans without knowing all the details, that amount
falls between the estimated $1.5 trillion cost of the Forbes plan
and the $156 billion tax cut proposal unsuccessfully put forward
this year by congressional Republicans, McIntyre said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan would also provide a number of increased tax
deductions. For example, Bush plans to double the child tax credit
to $1,000 and to increase the allowable annual contribution to
educational savings accounts to $5,000 from $500. Bush also
proposes expanding the use of the education accounts not just for
college but also to pay for private elementary and secondary
schooling.

REDUCING HEART RISK FACTORS CAN EXTEND LIFE, NEW STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Want to increase the odds of living 6 to 10 years longer?
</P>
<P>
   For those who do, the prescription is simple: just don't smoke,
lower cholesterol below the current American average, and keep
blood pressure within healthy limits.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that each individual who follows this
advice will reap additional years of benefit. But a new analysis,
published Wednesday, provides the best evidence yet that, on
average, lifespans can be extended this much by paying attention to
just these three risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis also suggests that far more progress is possible in
the nation's fight against cardiovascular disease, even though
deaths from heart attacks and strokes have already plummeted nearly
60 percent from their peaks in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Further gains would not require America to become a nation of
pure-living ascetics. The authors of the study note that the goals
are attainable _ cholesterol below 200 milligrams per deciliter,
blood pressure below 120-over-80, and abstention from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   These levels are not far from where many Americans already are,
researchers point out, and the vast majority of Americans do not
smoke. The other side of the coin, however, is that millions of
people still smoke and have high cholesterol and blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of lowering these risks are not limited to reduced
risk of heart disease. The overall risk of dying from cancer was
also about 50 percent lower for men and 17 percent lower for women
in the low-risk categories for smoking, cholesterol, and blood
pressure, according to the study, published in this week's Journal
of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis found no evidence, as some earlier studies had,
that lower cholesterol is associated with higher cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the new analysis is the first to measure directly
the lifespan-lengthening effect of favorable cholesterol, blood
pressure, and smoking status. Up to now, researchers have had to
make an educated guess about the death risk among people in
low-risk categories, since no studies were large enough or long
enough to tally sufficient numbers of deaths among low-risk
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In previous studies, not enough people had low levels of all
three major risk factors ``to permit direct measurement of risk,''
explain Dr. Jeremiah Stamler and his colleagues at Northwestern
University and the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Their analysis encompassed 360,330 men and 6,229 women who
enrolled in two large studies begun between 1967 and 1975, the
Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) and the Chicago
Heart Association Detection Project in Industry.
</P>
<P>
   The data included 16 years of follow-up among the MRFIT
participants while those in the Chicago study were followed for 22
years. Nearly all deaths and their causes were accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis found that men who were young when they entered the
studies _ between 18 and 39 years old _ had 6.3 years to 9.5 years
more estimated life expectancy if they met the low-risk criteria
for smoking, blood pressure, and cholesterol, compared to all other
men of similar age.
</P>
<P>
   Among middle-aged men, from 40 to 59 years old, those who were
low-risk could expect about six years of additional life compared
to all others.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-aged women who were low-risk had 5.8 more years of life
expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   The studies did not record dietary or exercise habits, but
Stamler and his colleagues suggested that cholesterol level and
blood pressure may be not only risk-reducing factors in themselves
but also indicators of healthier lifestyles that included better
diet and more exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of not smoking and having lower cholesterol and
blood pressure extended to African Americans as well as whites, and
to those of lower socioeconomic status.
</P>
<P>
   Although genetic factors play a role in heart disease, cancer,
and other major causes of death, the researchers said successes in
reducing lifestyle-associated risk factors shows that genetics is
not a barrier to further improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge,'' the wrote, ``is to mobilize the societal will
and resources to realize these goals in all population strata to
end the coronary heart disease epidemic early in the next
century.''

JUDGE OKS DOW CORNING BREAST IMPLANT SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BAY CITY, Mich. _ A federal judge approved a plan Tuesday to
allow Dow Corning Corp., to settle thousands of lawsuits brought by
women who claimed the firm's silicone breast implants caused them
serious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The implant plan is part of a larger $4.5 billion package
approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Spector designed to
allow Dow Corning to emerge from bankruptcy. The firm sought legal
protection in May 1995 because it couldn't cope with the onslaught
of lawsuits brought by women with implants.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan _ which is expected to be appealed _ Dow Corning
would pay a total of $3.2 billion to 170,000 women with silicone
breast implants. Another $1.3 billion would be used to pay other
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot ahead before any money is passed,''
Spector said during a 20-minute hearing. He called his ruling ``the
end to the first chapter.''
</P>
<P>
   Spector did not elaborate on how he ruled on various issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important day, one we've been looking forward
to for the last four and a half years,'' said Gary Anderson, Dow
Corning's president and chief executive officer. But, he conceded,
``it isn't the final, final day.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Houser, the lead attorney for Dow Corning, said Spector
approved the $4.5 billion plan that the company proposed last
November.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plan, women would receive between $12,000 and
$300,000, depending on the severity of their illnesses. Women could
receive up to $25,000 if their implants were found to have leaked
and ruptured. They can also receive $5,000 to have their implants
removed. The payments would be made over 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   If women accept the settlement they cannot sue Dow Corning or
its parents _ The Dow Chemical Co. or Corning Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Women who decide not to accept the settlement from Dow Corning
can sue the company in federal court in Detroit. Dow Corning will
set aside $400 million to pay for any cases they might lose.
</P>
<P>
   The company got out of the implant business in 1992 after the
Food and Drug Administration banned the use of silicone breast
implants on the ground that Dow Corning and other manufacturers
could not prove they were ``safe and effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result of the FDA's action, hundreds of thousands of
women sued Dow Corning _ once the world's largest manufacturer of
breast implants _ and other implant makers.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning was facing nearly 19,000 lawsuits when it filed for
bankruptcy in 1995. The other implant manufacturers, including
Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing Co. and Baxter Healthcare Corp.,
have since settled implant lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning has long maintained that implants cannot be linked
to disease and, indeed, recent scientific studies have found
implants do not cause serious disease such as cancer or lupus.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs dissatisfied with Spector's ruling were weighing
whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Geoffrey White, who represents 50 Nevada women with
implants, criticized part of the settlement plan that bars lawsuits
against Dow Chemical and Corning _ Dow Corning's parent companies.
He said the plan gives Dow Chemical a `` free ride'' and said he'd
take his challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. The
Nevada Supreme Court has ruled that Dow Chemical can be sued over
breast implant claims against Dow Corning.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers said they may appeals the $3.2 billion limit to
pay breast implant claims as well as the $400,000 limit to pay
women should they win jury trials.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is also weighing whether to appeal
Spector's ruling on the grounds that federal programs such as
Medicare _ which have paid for treatment of women with implants _
should be entitled to money.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bohan, representing the Department of Justice, said during
the hearing that the government wants the right to appeal on those
grounds.

ABORTION CURBS IN 2 STATES TEMPORARILY BLOCKED BY HIGH COURT
ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Wis., Neb.)   (also see SCOTUS-PLAYBOY)  
(bl) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday temporarily blocked
enforcement of abortion restrictions in Wisconsin and Illinois to
give the justices time to consider whether to decide the
constitutionality of the two states' so-called partial-birth
abortion laws.
</P>
<P>
   The order was issued by Justice John Paul Stevens in his
capacity as the justice with jurisdiction over the 7th Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals, in Chicago. That court rejected constitutional
challenges to the two laws in a 5-4 decision in October. It then
refused twice, including Tuesday on a tie vote of 5-5, to issue a
stay of its own ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The laws would have gone into effect Wednesday had Stevens not
intervened. Doctors who violate the Illinois law face three years
in prison while the Wisconsin law carries a penalty of up to life
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors and abortion clinics challenging the two laws,
represented in the Illinois case by the American Civil Liberties
Union and in the Wisconsin case by the Center for Reproductive Law
and Policy, in New York, have not yet filed their Supreme Court
appeals but expect to do so in the next month.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is already before the justices in a petition filed two
weeks ago by the state of Nebraska, where a similar law was struck
down in September by the 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. The
justices could decide by mid-January whether to hear the Nebraska
appeal, possibly in time for a ruling by the end of the current
term in early summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has not heard an abortion case since 1992,
when by a 5-4 vote it reaffirmed the constitutional right to
abortion first established in Roe vs. Wade. While there is no
guarantee that the justices will take any of the current round of
cases, the conflicting rulings by the 7th and 8th circuits
substantially increases the likelihood.
</P>
<P>
   While Stevens offered no elaboration on his order Tuesday, the
court's own practice is to grant a stay only in cases that are good
candidates for eventual review on the merits.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty states have enacted laws to prohibit a particular method
of performing late-term abortion. Lower courts have blocked most of
them after finding, as the 8th Circuit did in the Nebraska case,
that the description of the medical procedure was broad and vague
enough possibly to outlaw another, much more common method of
abortion that is used before a fetus can live outside the womb. In
upholding the Wisconsin and Illinois laws, the 7th Circuit majority
conceded that these, too, were vague as written. But the appeals
court said the problem could be cured by U.S. District Courts in
the two states issuing ``precautionary injunctions'' that would
limit prosecutions under the laws until their meaning was clarified
by amendments, regulations, or state court rulings.

COMMENTARY: SENSELESS IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there anything more ridiculous in the news today then the
protests against the World Trade Organization in Seattle? I doubt
it.
</P>
<P>
   These anti-WTO protesters _ who are a Noah's ark of flat-earth
advocates, protectionist trade unions and yuppies looking for their
1960s fix _ are protesting against the wrong target with the wrong
tools. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   What unites the anti-WTO crowd is their realization that we now
live in a world without walls. The Cold War system we just emerged
from was built around division and walls; the globalization system
that we are now in is built around integration and webs. In this
new system, jobs, cultures, environmental problems and labor
standards can much more easily flow back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   The ridiculous thing about the protesters is that they find
fault with this, and blame the WTO. The WTO is not the cause of
this world without walls, it's the effect. The more countries trade
with one another, the more they need an institution to set the
basic rules of trade, and that is all the WTO does. ``Rules are a
substitute for walls _ when you don't have walls you need more
rules,'' notes the Council on Foreign Relations expert Michael
Mandelbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Because some countries try to use their own rules to erect new
walls against trade, the WTO adjudicates such cases. For instance,
there was the famous ``Flipper vs. GATTzilla'' dispute. (The WTO
used be known as GATT.) America has rules against catching tuna in
nets that might also snare dolphins; other countries don't, and
those other countries took the United States before a GATT tribunal
and charged that our insistence on Flipper-free tuna was a trade
barrier. The anti-WTO protesters extrapolate from such narrow cases
that the WTO is going to become a Big Brother and tell us how to
live generally. Nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   What's crazy is that the protesters want the WTO to become
precisely what they accuse it of already being _ a global
government. They want it to set more rules _ their rules, which
would impose our labor and environmental standards on everyone
else. I'm for such higher standards, and over time the WTO may be a
vehicle to enforce them, but it's not the main vehicle to achieve
them. And they are not going to be achieved by putting up new trade
walls.
</P>
<P>
   Every country and company that has improved its labor, legal and
environmental standards has done so because of more global trade,
more integration, more Internet _ not less. These are the best
tools we have for improving global governance.
</P>
<P>
   Who is one of the top environmental advisers to DuPont today?
Paul Gilding, the former head of Greenpeace! How could that be? A
DuPont official told me that in the old days, if DuPont wanted to
put a chemical factory in a city, it knew it just had to persuade
the local neighbors. ``Now we have six billion neighbors,'' said
the DuPont official _ meaning that DuPont knows that in a world
without walls if it wants to put up a chemical plant in a country,
every environmentalist is watching. And if that factory makes even
a tiny spill those environmentalists will put it on the World Wide
Web and soil DuPont's name from one end of the earth to the other.
</P>
<P>
   I recently visited a Victoria's Secret garment factory in Sri
Lanka that, in terms of conditions, I would let my own daughters
work in. Why does it have such a high standard? Because
anti-sweatshop activists have started to mobilize enough consumers
to impress Victoria's Secret that if it doesn't get its shop
standards up, consumers won't buy its goods. Sri Lanka is about to
pass new copyright laws, which Sri Lankan software writers have
been seeking for years to protect their own innovations. Why the
new law now? Because Microsoft told Sri Lanka it wouldn't sell its
products in a country with such weak intellectual property laws.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, I want to save Flipper too. It's a question of how. If the
protesters in Seattle stopped yapping, they would realize that they
have been duped by knaves like Pat Buchanan _ duped into thinking
that power lies with the WTO. It doesn't. There's never going to be
a global government to impose the rules the protesters want. But
there can be better global governance _ on the environment,
intellectual property and labor. You achieve that not by adopting
1960s tactics in a Web-based world _ not by blocking trade, choking
globalization or getting the WTO to put up more walls. That's a
fool's errand.
</P>
<P>
   You make a difference today by using globalization _ by
mobilizing the power of trade, the power of the Internet and the
power of consumers to persuade, or embarrass, global corporations
and nations to upgrade their standards. You change the world when
you get the big players to do the right things for the wrong
reasons. But that takes hard work _ coalition-building with
companies and consumers, and follow-up. It's not as much fun as a
circus in Seattle.

AMMIANO FIGHTS TO KEEP MINIMUM WAGE MEASURE INTACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Tom Ammiano, president of the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors and candidate for mayor, battled City Hall on
Tuesday to keep intact his legislation to boost the pay for
thousands of low-paid workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Living Wage Task Force, putting the final touches on a set
of recommendations that will be presented to the Board of
Supervisors next month, tentatively calls for altering Ammiano's
legislation in two significant areas: money and scope.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law sponsored by Ammiano would require city
contractors and those who lease city property to pay their workers
at least $11 an hour plus benefits, or $12 an hour without
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The task force wants to lower the proposed minimum pay to $7.50
an hour plus benefits during the first year the law is in effect,
$8.25 an hour plus benefits in the second year, and $9 an hour plus
benefits in year three, said task force chair Jim Illig, an
administrator at Project Open Hand.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage in California is $5.75.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the task force hopes to exempt businesses that
operate on property owned by the Port of San Francisco, such as the
tourist-oriented restaurants in Fisherman's Wharf. It's still
undecided whether the task force will recommend that businesses at
the airport also be exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano bluntly rejected the proposal as not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't accept those recommendations,'' said Ammiano, who is
challenging Mayor Willie Brown in the Dec. 14 mayoral runoff
election.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said the proposal can be used as the launching point
for debate during hearings before the Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something to work with,'' he said. ``Maybe their strategy
is to go up because it's too low now.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force's tentative decision was based on the hope of
making the law more affordable to businesses that are forced to
comply and to keep them competitive with rivals who are exempt.
</P>
<P>
   A majority on the task force said the lower wages being
recommended would result in more workers ultimately being covered,
assuming that the city ends up subsidizing the increased cost to
contractors and has a finite amount of money to spend.
</P>
<P>
   The living wage debate has been swirling at City Hall for more
than a year, and has emerged as a contentious issue in the campaign
between Ammiano and Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he supports a living wage law, but suggested
Ammiano's plan goes too far. The mayor has said an $11- or
$12-an-hour wage would strain city coffers and place a hardship on
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would prefer that the city force or nudge the raises
when the opportunity arises, as it did when a recent contract was
worked out for about 2,000 workers at the airport who provide
security and clean and fuel the planes.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano said a broader approach is needed to help lift a larger
pool of low-wage workers out of poverty and to reduce the financial
strain on the city's programs for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   As written, his proposal would be the most far-reaching in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 40 cities and counties have enacted a living wage law,
but they differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in terms of how
much workers must be paid, whether benefits must be offered and
what businesses must comply.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland requires wages of $8 an hour, with benefits, and Santa
Clara County $10, plus benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano said that given the high cost of living in San
Francisco, $14 an hour would be even more appropriate than the
level he proposed.
</P>
<P>
   He called the $9-an-hour minimum the task force suggested ``a
mockery of living wage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Jacobs, who heads the Living Wage Coalition, the
community-based organization pushing hardest for Ammiano's plan,
also voiced disdain over the task force's stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's outrageous. You can't live in San Francisco on
$7.50 an hour. It just won't pay the rent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also questioned the credibility of the task force, which is
weighted with employers and has not had a strong voice for low-paid
workers and unions since their representatives resigned.
</P>
<P>
   While the task force has been tinkering with the plan, Brown
last week floated a suggestion that would expand Ammiano's plan by
tying building permits for large job-producing businesses to higher
wages and benefits for their workers. He also suggested that a
softer approach be explored, such as offering businesses tax breaks
if they pay their employees a living wage.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he would sign any living wage law the Board of
Supervisors passes, but with a caveat: It must be financially
prudent and practical to implement. Brown has not specified exactly
what that means, but in an appearance Monday with Ammiano he again
said he was certain the board would produce such a responsible
living wage law.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's plan has been embraced by organized labor, generally
scorned by business leaders, and received mixed reviews in the
nonprofit sector, whose employees staff many of the city-funded
health care and social service programs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest questions the Board of Supervisors will
tackle is whether the city will provide extra money to nonprofits
to help cover the mandated raises.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study on Ammiano's proposed law by San Francisco State
University's Urban Institute said the ordinance would cost San
Francisco businesses an estimated $210 million over two years. The
cost passed through to city taxpayers would be an estimated $74
million.
</P>
<P>
   The task force, which was appointed by the Board of Supervisors,
is still studying the proposal. The panel's draft report is due
Monday; a hearing on the recommendations has been scheduled for
Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Supervisors is set to receive the task force's
suggestions Dec. 16 - two days after the mayor's election - and
from there, a new set of hearings will be held before the board
makes a final decision. If adopted, the mayor then must decide
whether to sign the legislation or to veto it.

<P>
   DENVER _ Ever since he helped revive Frontier Airlines in 1993,
Samuel D. Addoms, its chief executive, has considered himself a
Boeing man.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no easy task when Addoms walked into a conference room
at the carrier's headquarters here in mid-October and told a top
Boeing salesman that Frontier would be swapping its 20-plane fleet
of 737s for jets made by Airbus Industrie, the European consortium
that is Boeing's sole rival.
</P>
<P>
   After training its pilots and mechanics to fly and maintain its
new Airbus planes, it is unlikely that Frontier will buy another
Boeing jet for at least a generation because sticking with one type
of airplane significantly reduces its costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a middle ground,'' Addoms said of the competition
for Frontier's business. ``You either win or you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, a proud company that has dominated commercial aviation
since the 1950s, is losing often these days. So far this year,
Airbus has outsold Boeing by more than two to one, the largest gap
since Airbus was founded in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided orders have prompted many in the aviation industry
and on Wall Street to consider what would have been unthinkable a
decade ago: that Boeing is in danger of slipping behind Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   Long the scrappy challenger, Airbus is now widely seen as more
innovative and savvier at sales than is stodgy Boeing. Many
once-loyal Boeing customers, like Frontier, now find Airbus planes
to be technologically superior and more comfortable for passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were running Boeing , I would be pretty concerned,'' said
Robert J. Genise, chief executive of Boullion Aviation Services,
which leases both Boeing and Airbus jets to airlines. ``These are
decisions that are not readily reversible.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's long-term health has consequences that echo far beyond
its headquarters in Seattle. It is the nation's largest exporter,
with nearly $27 billion in overseas sales last year. Since World
War II, leaders in Washington and Europe have viewed civil
aerospace as a strategic industry that provides thousands of
high-paying jobs and helps amortize the high costs of military
research.
</P>
<P>
   A weakened Boeing would likely revive trade tensions between the
European Union and Washington, which has repeatedly accused France,
Germany and Britain of unfairly subsidizing Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its recent setbacks, Boeing still has some distinct
strengths. After swallowing its longtime rival, McDonnell Douglas,
in 1997, it is by far the world's largest aerospace company with
$56 billion in sales last year. Boeing now makes fighter jets,
launches satellites and is NASA's largest contractor. This year it
will deliver a record 620 passenger jets, more than twice as many
as Airbus does.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fatal crash of a Boeing 767 flown by Egyptair and
the Federal Aviation Administration's announcement this week that
it will inspect quality controls at Boeing's factories after
several recent lapses, the world's airlines still consider Boeing
jets to be safe and reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't spend time worrying about orders,'' Philip M. Condit,
Boeing's chairman and chief executive, said in October. ``What
really matters is what comes out the factory door.''
</P>
<P>
   Because there is a gap of several years between when a plane is
ordered and when it is delivered and because many airlines are
consolidating their fleets around a few types of jets to cut costs,
Airbus' gains over Boeing today mean that Boeing's future
deliveries will shrink while Airbus' will grow. By the end of the
next decade, Airbus could be producing more jets than Boeing,
reversing a dominance dating to the mid-1950s, when Boeing
introduced the 707, the first commercially successful passenger
jet.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Boeing is no longer the daring industry leader that
nearly bankrupted itself 30 years ago building the 747 jumbo jet.
That airplane captured the imagination of millions and quickly
became an emblem of the 20th century. It is still the world's
largest civilian aircraft, occupying the last _ and most lucrative
_ niche in Boeing's product line that Airbus has yet to crack.
</P>
<P>
   To remedy that Airbus is now proposing to build the A3XX, an
airborne cruise ship that would carry 550 passengers (compared with
420 on the biggest 747) and offer sleeping cabins and workout
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing says there is not enough demand from the world's airlines
to justify the cost of building a new superjumbo jet. Its
alternative is to develop a larger version of the 747. Airbus is
pressing ahead with the A3XX even though many analysts say that
plane will end up costing 50 percent more than Airbus' estimate of
$10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can make the A3XX go,'' said Richard Aboulafia, an
aviation consultant with the Teal Group in Alexandria, Va., ``then
they will really transform themselves into the market leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's current timidity is the result of a disastrous attempt
in the mid-1990s to deal a death blow to Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to gain a lock on the narrow-body market, Boeing sold the
new version of its 737 to several large American carriers at steep
discounts. But making a profit on the deals was contingent on
Boeing's slashing production costs. Instead, the rush of new orders
clogged Boeing's production line, causing its costs to soar. The
crisis came to a head in late 1997, when the company was forced to
halt production of the 737 and 747 to sort out the mess.
</P>
<P>
   The freeze forced Boeing to delay deliveries, angering many
airlines. It also cost the company billions of dollars, forcing it
to post its first annual loss in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Boeing executives say that Airbus is cutting prices
to gain market share. The day before the Frontier deal was
announced, Condit said the company had bowed out of the competition
because it could not make a profit on the deal. But Addoms and
other Frontier executives said that Boeing was fighting to the end.
They and other airline executives said that Airbus was aggressive
but that their decision to buy the European airplanes never came
down to price.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, we bought the product because we
thought it was better.'' said David Neeleman, the chief executive
of Jetblue Airways, a new carrier based at Kennedy Airport in New
York. It will fly only Airbus planes.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, politics appears to play a strong role. In the
face of heavy lobbying by both European and American officials, El
Al, Israel's national airline, which currently flies only Boeing
jets, is considering a Solomonic solution: splitting an order for
wide-body jets between the two manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   That Airbus is even in a position to challenge Boeing for
leadership in civil aerospace is one of the great Cinderella
stories of global commerce. Founded as a French-German joint
venture in 1970 that soon added the British and the Spanish, Airbus
was a quixotic attempt to compete with the American aerospace
industry, which had been dominated since World War II by Boeing,
McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed.
</P>
<P>
   But over the next two decades, both Lockheed and McDonnell
Douglas faded after each gambled millions on expensive jetliners
that failed to catch on. Meanwhile, Airbus, nurtured with cheap
credit and political lobbying, developed some winning designs.
</P>
<P>
   It has also proved to be a skilled marketer. For years, Airbus
failed to crack British Airways, which stubbornly retained an
all-Boeing fleet. The airline finally ordered its first A320s last
year, after Airbus rented a 737, placed it nose to nose on the
tarmac with an A320 and invited British Airways executives to
compare the two.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry executives, including Airbus' top managers,
believe that the consortium's biggest weakness is its awkward
ownership structure, which forces Airbus to make some decisions
based on the needs of individual owners rather than to maximize
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the consortium took a big step toward its
goal of consolidating under a single corporate owner when
DaimlerChrysler, which owns 37.9 percent, agreed to buy
Construcciones Aeronauticas of Spain, a 4.2 percent holder. Then in
October, DaimlerChrysler announced that it was merging its
aerospace subsidiary with Aerospatiale Matra of France, which also
owns 37.9 percent of Airbus. When the deal is completed, British
Aerospace will be the only outside Airbus shareholder, with 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its current setup, many analysts believe that Airbus is
a more efficient manufacturer than Boeing. The consortium denies
that it sells planes below cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Condit said that he can't sustain deals at these levels
and make a profit, it is music to my ears,'' said Henri Courpron,
Airbus' chief salesman in North America. ``Because I can assure you
that I can do deals like Frontier every day and still make money.''
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Boeing may have made a mistake in 1993, when it
decided to remodel the narrow-body 737 that was first introduced in
the 1960s, rather than invest in an entirely new plane. The new
737s fly higher, faster and farther than did the earlier versions
and their cockpits were updated with modern computer displays and
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing retained the same size fuselage, while the A320 is
seven inches wider. The difference has come to haunt executives in
Seattle because many airlines are feeling the sting from passengers
who complain that they are being jammed into narrow seats in rows
placed more closely together.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a pure marketing perspective, there is a value there,''
said Jeff S. Potter, a Frontier vice president and a former
salesman for McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Another innovative design that is proving decisive was Airbus'
early decision to develop a family of aircraft that share the same
cockpit design so that pilots can easily shift from one model to
the next, reducing training costs. Boeing, on the other hand, has
several different families of aircraft that have different cockpit
styles.
</P>
<P>
   The family concept made it much easier for Airbus to win
additional orders from airlines to which it had managed to make one
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus was able to achieve such commonality because it pioneered
the use of electronics to control the movement of rudders and wing
flaps rather than mechanical wires and pulleys. With the help of
computers, the controls of a wide-body jet carrying 380 passengers
can be made to feel and perform the same as a single-aisle jet
carrying 120.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Boeing executives played down the advantages of
so-called fly-by-wire technology. But in the late 1980s, the
company decided to design its newest jet _ the 777 _ as a
fly-by-wire airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The 777, a twin-engine, wide-body plane carrying up to 380
passengers, is now Boeing's flagship. Airlines like its low
operating cost and passengers generally find it comfortable. Steve
Binder, an aerospace analyst at Bear, Stearns in New York, said
that in order to combat Airbus, Boeing may have to design a new jet
to replace the 737 that is more compatible with the 777.
</P>
<P>
   But others believe that Boeing's bigger challenge is to change
its insular corporate culture, learn to build its planes more
cheaply and to capitalize on its natural advantage with airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at his desk, Potter of Frontier drew a large oval on a
blank sheet of paper. ``If this is a race track,'' he explained,
describing the recent sales campaign, ``Boeing was halfway around
before Airbus even got to the starting gate. But by the end, the
two were nose to nose and Airbus won.'' &QL;

SUITOR RAISES VALUE OF WARNER-LAMBERT

<P>
   American Home Products Corp. said Tuesday that it would work to
give Warner-Lambert Co.'s shareholders ``additional value'' under
their merger agreement to reflect possible increased revenue from
the cholesterol-reducing drug Lipitor.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert had marketed Lipitor with Pfizer Inc., but it
sued on Monday to end the two companies' arrangement. The suit was
the latest in a series of maneuvers by the three companies to gain
an upper hand in a merger battle that may drag on into next year.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products and Warner-Lambert announced a
$70-billion merger deal Nov. 4, but Pfizer made an $82.4-billion
hostile bid for Warner-Lambert that afternoon. Since then,
Warner-Lambert and Pfizer have accused each other of breaching the
agreement to sell Lipitor.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the merger scuffle, which is now before the Delaware
Chancery Court, American Home Products has remained silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the statement as code for American Home Products to
increase the value of its bid,'' Steven Gerber, a managing director
at CIBC World Markets, said of Tuesday's development.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks of all three companies fell Tuesday. Warner-Lambert's
stock dropped $1.375, or 1.5 percent, to $90. Shares of American
Home Products fell 50 cents, to $52, and Pfizer dropped $1.25, or
3.3 percent, to $36.1875.

EXXON-MOBIL OK HINGES ON EXTENSIVE DIVESTITURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal antitrust regulators approved Tuesday the $87 billion
merger of Exxon and Mobil, reuniting two key units of the former
Standard Oil trust broken up by the government 88 years ago. But to
prevent a new monopoly, they required the petroleum giants shed
extensive investments.
</P>
<P>
   By a 4-0 vote, the Federal Trade Commission approved a
settlement, to become final in January, under which Exxon and Mobil
would sell or exchange more than 2,400 of their nearly 16,000 gas
stations, including every Exxon-owned or -supplied gas station in
New England, New York, and California, and all Mobil stations in
the New Jersey-Virginia corridor and in parts of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever buys the stations could continue to use the Mobil and
Exxon names, branded fuels, and services such as their credit cards
and the Mobil Speedpass payment system for at least 10 years,
allowing them to profit from the marketing might of the famed brand
names.
</P>
<P>
   ``This settlement should preserve competition and protect
consumers from inappropriate and anticompetitive price increases,''
commission chairman Robert Pitofsky said, noting that every 1
percent by which the companies could raise the price of gas would
cost consumers $240 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon chairman Lee Raymond said the deal clears the way for
creation of ``the world's premier petroleum and petrochemical
company'' and that annual operating savings will probably exceed
the $2.8 billion identified last year. Officials predicted the
companies will consummate their merger into a new Exxon Mobil Corp.
as soon as Wednesday. Its shares will trade under the ticker symbol
XOM.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry analysts said the FTC move actually helps the
company, by allowing it to shed low-margin retailing and refining
operations while creating a richer, stronger competitor for oil
exploration, the most lucrative sector of the business.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC action, the largest retail divestiture ever required,
came nearly a year after the former Standard Oil of New York
(Mobil) and Standard Oil of New Jersey (Exxon) announced plans to
combine, and just months after it agreed to let two other former
Standard Oil units created by the 1911 breakup of John D.
Rockefeller's empire _ Amoco and Sohio _ recombine with British
Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   The companies may face some legal problems with station lessors
who want the first right at buying the stations they operate. But
the FTC wants no more than one or two companies to buy the
Northeastern markets being shed, in order to ensure a strong
competitor for the remaining Mobil stations, including 485 in
Massachusetts, where Mobil leads the market with a 24 percent share
of all gas pumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are gaining confidence that litigation will not be
necessary,'' said Jim Daskal, counsel to the National Coalition of
Petroleum Retailers, which lobbied the FTC during its nearly
yearlong review of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   While the move will create a roster of Exxon-branded stations
that have no direct connection to Exxon Mobil, part of the deal
requires that Exxon stations continue to sell Exxon-produced
gasoline with the company's unique additives.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Stephen Dodge, associate director of the
Massachusetts Petroleum Council, said, ``The effect on the consumer
will be nothing. For at least 10 years, the average driver won't
see any change at all. If they didn't read about it in the paper,
they would never even know it was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys general from 13 states signed off on the deal as well.
Bay State attorney general Thomas F. Reilly said, ``I am extremely
pleased with this settlement. We are confident it will preserve the
competition that should always exist in the Massachusetts
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Exxon and Mobil will also reimburse the states for $1.55 million
in legal fees and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Exxon fell slightly Tuesday, down 1/16 to 79-5/16 in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Mobil shares inched upward,
gaining 13/16 to close at 104-5/16. Investors apparently concluded
the divestitures are largely helpful. ``If you look at where they
have to sell assets, US refining and marketing is their
lowest-return business,'' said Mark Hastings, an energy analyst at
Citibank Global Asset Management in Stamford, Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil must complete its divestitures within nine months,
and if it fails to do so, the commission can appoint a trustee with
power to sell off an ever larger group of assets. It has 12 months
to sell a California refinery that produces the special blend of
gas required in that state and to divest its Exxon stations there.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon and Mobil shareholders approved the merger in late May.
With a combined market capitalization of more than $275 billion,
Exxon Mobil would be one of the world's five largest companies,
with annual sales of more than $167 billion and profits of more
than $8 billion, according to FTC figures. Company officials expect
to cut 10,000 to 12,000 jobs.

STUDY FINDS SOME GULF WAR VETERANS WITH SIGNS OF BRAIN DAMAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some veterans of the Persian Gulf war who have
complained of chronic illnesses have signs of brain damage caused
by exposure to toxic chemicals, the authors of a scientific study
partly financed by the Pentagon reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Magnetic scans of sick veterans found lower-than-normal levels
of a certain chemical, indicating damage in the parts of the brain
that control reflexes, movement, memory and emotion, the study's
authors said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 American service members sent to the Persian
Gulf in 1990 and 1991 have since reported experiencing a raft of
maladies, including fatigue, muscle pain, memory loss and sleep
disorders, which have collectively come to be known as gulf war
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers stopped short of identifying the exact cause of
the brain damage, saying that more medical research was needed. But
coupled with a survey last month sponsored by the Pentagon, the
findings showed that scientists were narrowing in on chemical
exposure _ from pesticides, low levels of nerve gas or an
experimental drug given to troops _ as the cause of the illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted by researchers at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and presented on
Tuesday at the annual convention of the Radiological Society of
North America in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, declined to
discuss the findings in detail, saying they were preliminary and
had not yet been subjected to peer review in an academic journal,
which the authors said they expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many steps to go here,'' Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   The study's principal author, James L. Fleckenstein, a professor
of radiology, said in an interview that the study was the first to
show brain damage in sick veterans.
</P>
<P>
   He and his colleagues examined 22 veterans complaining of
illnesses using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which measures
chemical levels in the brain, and compared the results with those
from 18 healthy veterans. The experiment was repeated in a sample
of six more veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The scans found that sick veterans had 10 to 25 percent lower
levels of N-acetyl-aspartate, signaling a loss of neurons in the
brain stem and basal ganglia. Veterans with more severe symptoms
showed the lowest levels of the chemical.

ON TRIAL AT THE MET: THE ART OF THE CONNOISSEUR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Fake'' is an unkind word to say to museum curators.
But the Meropolitan Museum has heard it many times in the past two
years, after one of its most highly touted recent acquisitions, the
Chinese scroll painting titled ``Riverbank,'' attributed to the
10th-century artist Dong Yuan, was accused of being a 20th-century
forgery.
</P>
<P>
   The word is likely to crackle in the air like static at the Met
next Saturday, when the painting _ a towering depiction of a
mountainous landscape being swept by a storm _ gets its day in
court at an international symposium titled ``Issues of Authenticity
in Chinese Painting.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading a stellar prosecution will be the art historian James
Cahill, who contends that ``Riverbank'' dates from the 1950s and is
the work of the Chinese artist, collector and forger extraordinaire
Zhang Daqian (1899-1983), a prolific multitasker who has been
called the Chinese Picasso. Seconding Cahill will be Sherman Lee,
former director of the Cleveland Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Among those appearing for the defense will be two curators in
the Met's Asian art department, Wen C. Fong and Maxwell K. Hearn,
presenting arguments in support of an early date and authorship.
Some of their findings are spelled out in the current Met
exhibition titled ``The Artist as Collector: Masterpieces from the
C.C. Wang Family Collection,'' where ``Riverbank'' is on display
through Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in a debate like this are not small. If ``Riverbank''
were proved beyond reasonable doubt to be what the Met believes it
to be, the museum would own one of the most important Chinese
paintings in any collection, by one of the progenitors of the
classical landscape tradition. And art history would have to expand
to accommodate it.
</P>
<P>
   But if the painting were to be confirmed as a fraud, many things
would be diminished. The Met's bank account, of course. (The
painting was bought at an undisclosed sum from the artist-collector
C.C. Wang and must have cost a bundle.) But also scholarly
reputations, and, in subtle ways, the public's faith in the
credibility of that quasi-mystical selective device known as the
connoisseur's eye.
</P>
<P>
   It is such an eye _ or group of eyes _ that brings a painting
like ``Riverbank'' to a major museum in the first place. And what
may really go on trial next Saturday isn't a painting but
connoisseurship itself, and the seal of authenticity that it
represents.
</P>
<P>
   What is connoisseurship? Basically, the assessment of the
identity and relative value of a work of art through analysis of
external evidence: in the case of Chinese painting, physical
materials (ink, paint, silk or paper), style (composition and
brushwork), documents (seals, inscriptions, records), and
comparable or related works.
</P>
<P>
   Who are the connoisseurs of Chinese art? In the West, they are
usually art historians, dealers or collectors. In China,
traditionally they have been artists.
</P>
<P>
   Through a lifelong practice of painting, the theory goes, they
develop an intimate, second-nature knowledge of the subtleties of
style and a nose for discerning the authentic from the bogus that
historical knowledge alone cannot match. Zhang Daqian was part of
this artist-connoisseur tradition. So is Wang, who bought
``Riverbank'' from Zhang in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But authenticity means different things in different cultures.
In Western art, the original _ the unique object, the genius
creator _ is everything. And a conceptual, even legal understanding
of the distinctions between the original and a copy, and a copy and
a forgery, is clear cut.
</P>
<P>
   In Chinese painting, by contrast, tradition predominates over
individuality (though that is also prized). And the concept of
authenticity, of what constitutes the genuine article, is more
nuanced.
</P>
<P>
   As a medium, ink-and-brush painting on silk or paper is
evanescent, and relatively few early examples survive. As a result,
Chinese artists, in what amounts to a kind of centuries-long
collective archiving process, have copied and recopied revered
works, and many of these copies have come to be regarded as
masterpieces in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Copying takes various forms. The painstaking duplicate is often
executed as an academic exercise, a way of absorbing a famous
master's technique and, through it, a trace of his spirit. A copy
can also be an imitation or emulation, a loose, freehand play on an
existing model.
</P>
<P>
   Or it can be a painting of entirely new themes using the
essential elements of a master's signature style. Just as copying
has degrees of shading, the distinction between a copy and forgery
can be fuzzy, often defined (as in the West) purely by intention.
An exacting copy may be done for many reasons, self-discipline
among them.
</P>
<P>
   But if a painting is executed on artificially aged silk, or
supplied with a spurious signature or a fanciful provenance,
chances are strong that it is trying to pass itself off as
something it is not.
</P>
<P>
   The question of authenticity doesn't end there, though. Just as
any genuine painting can be a bad painting, so any forged painting
can be good, even a great one.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Riverbank,'' for example, turned out to be by Zhang Daqian,
then it would be a (italics)genuine(end italics) Zhang Daqian, with
a value of its own. ( Cahill, in fact, claims that the painting is
``the masterwork among his forgeries, and stands very high in his
oeuvre as a whole.'') The very ability to fool the practiced eye
can be a proof of aesthetic success.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Such successes, which have long caused dread in the museum
world, abound in Chinese painting. (Zhang is said to have produced
30,000 works in his long life, an unknown percentage of them
fraudulent.) And they make the task of authentification through
connoisseurship difficult indeed.
</P>
<P>
   And how does the enigmatic ``Riverbank,'' which was dubbed by
its former owner, Wang, as ``the Mona Lisa of Chinese painting,''
fit into all of this? That's the question that the Met symposium
(which is open to the public free of charge with museum admission)
will attempt to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill, who has for decades crusaded as a kind of Zhang Daqian
vigilante, blowing the whistle on numerous paintings in collections
worldwide, has no doubts that the painting is a forgery and that
Zhang Daqiang is its author. He suggested as much publicly as early
as 1980, and reiterated his opinion in no uncertain terms after the
Met put the work on view.
</P>
<P>
   At the symposium, he will bring what he calls ``an indictment in
14 counts'' against the painting, based on two basic tools in the
connoisseurial arsenal. Using stylistic analysis, he finds what he
considers to be technical tics and flaws that both preclude a
10th-century date and correspond to characteristics of Zhang's
work.
</P>
<P>
   And he navigates an elaborate, whodunit-style paper trail of
falsified documents and missing references to demonstrate that the
painting probably didn't exist before the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn on the Met team will offer a detailed physical analysis of
the painting to establish its antiquity. And Fong, referring to
Cahill's brief, will point out the folly of bringing Procrustean
20th-century Western stylistic criteria to bear on ``Riverbank,'' a
work that he says can be understood only in terms of a specific
period style, the period being the 10th century.
</P>
<P>
   The case itself is fraught with logistical problems and
contradictions. A carbon dating of the painting's silk cannot be
carried out (the Met says) without major damage to the painting
itself. And subjective interpretation of data simply comes with the
territory.
</P>
<P>
   For purposes of comparative analysis, the Met has hung an
acknowledged Zhang Daqian forgery of a 10th-century painting beside
``Riverbank.'' But where the museum finds telling differences
between the two paintings, Cahill finds similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Trials of this kind often end without a clear verdict, and it
looks like this one will, too (though the summary opinions of the
two scholar-referees for the occasion, Robert E. Harrist Jr. and
Jerome Silbergeld, remain a closely guarded secret). After all the
positions have been presented, ``Riverbank'' will still be a
10th-century work by Dong Yuan, or a 10th-century work but not by
Dong Yuan, or a Zhang Daqian forgery, or something else entirely.
</P>
<P>
   In short, connoisseurship is an imprecise science, and one that
has acquired an iffy name in certain academic circles in recent
years. An art history concerned with political ideas rather than
iconic objects tends to view it as the preserve of a clubby,
priestly cult professing magical, almost extrasensory powers.The
very concept of authenticity as a measure of value is seen as a
tool for shoring up a market and an elitist masterpiece canon.
</P>
<P>
   But just as we rely on skilled diagnosticians in medicine, who
operate on an undefinable combination of education, experience and
instinct, so we do in art. It is, after all, impossible to write an
accurate history, political, social or otherwise, based on faulty
evidence, and connoisseurship is one way, in many cases the only
way to ensure that the correct data are in place.
</P>
<P>
   And in some ways the sheer hunger for the unique object has
never been more intense. It may be no coincidence that as digital
technology conjures a world of endlessly reproducible,
transmittable images, the museum is booming.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds contemplating a Rembrandt or Van Gogh or a painting
attributed to Dong Yuan may not know what they're looking at,
historically speaking, but they are clearly after some primal
experience of the Real Thing.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, authenticity remains a burning issue, and a
painting like ``Riverbank,'' whatever its identity, becomes a
peculiarly troubling, tantalizing object. It really is a kind of
Mona Lisa, as Wang suggests, and whether it is smiling at our
recognition of its unique spirit or at our incredulity remains to
be seen.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: ARRANGING BUSINESS FLIGHTS VIA INTERNET

<P>
   Business travelers worldwide are increasingly embracing the
Internet to research and book their flights, an annual survey by
the International Air Transport Association has found.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two-thirds of the survey's approximately 1,000
respondents from Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region
said they used the Internet to find flight information, a 50
percent increase over the survey's results from two years ago. In
some cases, IATA compares the current results with year-earlier
figures, in others with figures from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, North American business travelers _ who made
up approximately one-third of the group surveyed _ were the
heaviest users of the Internet for flight research; 70 percent of
this group said they went online to do research, an increase of 27
percent over 1997. Such use grew at an even greater rate among
European travelers (an increase of 68 percent over 1997) and Asian
travelers (an increase of 63 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the number of travelers using the Internet actually to
book a trip has almost doubled, from 9 percent in IATA's 1998 poll
to 17 percent this year. One in 10 of those surveyed said they made
flight reservations online weekly, one-fifth use the Internet
monthly to book, while almost 40 percent make online bookings every
few months.
</P>
<P>
   The number of respondents who said they expected to use the
Internet to make travel plans in five years' time also increased
significantly, rising from 39 percent in 1997 to 51 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The IATA survey also found the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Some two-fifths of travelers have used electronic tickets, a
60 percent increase over 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two-thirds of respondents favor airport check-in desks over
automated check-in and curbside check-in.
</P>
<P>
   _ Delays are business travelers' greatest concern. Delays on
short-haul trips in particular were cited by 52 percent of
respondents this year, up from 36 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   _ Almost two-thirds of travelers said they were willing to try a
no-frills airline for short-haul flights, while 37 percent said
they were ``very willing'' to do this.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than two-thirds of respondents said they did not use
in-flight business services like telephones, faxes and computer
data ports on their last long-haul flight. When these were
employed, the telephone was used most. Rating in-flight
entertainment activities, respondents said they watched films the
most; they also said they watched news programs and read in-flight
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   _ Airline schedules are the most important factor when choosing
long-haul economy-class flights, respondents said, followed by
frequent-flier programs, low fares, seat comfort and audio systems.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Sherlock, executive director of the National Business
Travel Association, a trade group whose members are corporate
travel managers, questioned the survey's projections on future use
of the Internet. He predicted that corporations would not allow
their employees to go online to make reservations ``until airlines
satisfy their concerns about individuals booking on the Internet
and observing travel management policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Airline Update
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines is offering a new online booking program to
small and medium-size corporations that features incentives
including free tickets and upgrades, elite frequent-flier program
status, airport lounge memberships and travel management aids.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines is giving a bonus of 25,000 miles to
participants in its frequent-flier program who stay at least 10
times at Regent International Hotels by Dec. 30, 2000; each stay
must be a minimum of three nights. Travelers also must register
with Regent and pay the corporate room rate.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways established a Web site on London as a
destination (londontraveller.com) that contains in-depth
information on the city from a variety of travel guidebooks, as
well as data on the newest restaurants, bars, clubs, theater and
art exhibits. Visitors to the site can also buy airline tickets and
book hotel rooms.

<P>
   PORTO SEGURO, Brazil _ The history of the Brazilian nation began
here when a Portuguese flotilla hoping to reach India spied a
``mount, very high, round and wooded'' after a grueling 43-day
voyage.
</P>
<P>
   The seafarers found an anchorage, which they promptly named
``safe port,'' and sent a delegation ashore to talk to astonished
the locals, whom the mission's log described as ``innocent'' and
``childlike.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the 500th anniversary celebrations of the Portuguese
arrival fast approaching, the descendants of those earlier
inhabitants are trying to regain this historic piece of land.
</P>
<P>
   Since August more than 200 members of the Pataxo tribe
(pronounced pot-a-SHOW) have been occupying Monte Pascoal National
Park, site of the 1,742-foot hill that guided Pedro Alvares
Cabral's men to that first landfall on the afternoon of April 23,
1500.
</P>
<P>
   In North American terms, it is as if the Wampanoag tribe were to
seize Plymouth Rock and demand the return of the surrounding
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This park is still our house, even though someone else has
been living in it,'' said Joel Braz, director of the tribal council
representing more than a dozen nearby Pataxo villages. ``The only
way we can celebrate is by getting our land back. We are not going
to be satisfied until we achieve that, and we will fight if we have
to, because our survival as a people is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The symbolism of the Pataxo takeover, which includes replacing
the sign at the entrance of the park with one proclaiming a new
identity as the ``Pataxo Indigenous Park of Monte Pascoal,'' has
reverberated profoundly among Brazil's 165 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Like the United States, Brazil has found it difficult to come to
grips with the indigenous component of its past, beginning with the
enslavement and extermination of the Tupi group of tribes who were
ancestors of the Pataxo.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, ``the struggle of the Pataxo has become
emblematic of the whole indigenous movement in Brazil'' and forced
the government to tread lightly, said Sumario Santana of the
Indigenous Missionary Council, a Roman Catholic Church organization
that works closely with Indian groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is silent, but it doesn't have many options,''
he said. ``Either it admits the Pataxo are the legitimate owners,
or it kicks them out. I don't see a middle ground here.''
</P>
<P>
   But the government tried to reach a middle ground during
negotiations two decades ago, granting Pataxo villages in the area
access to 21,000 acres of the national park and leaving the
remaining 36,000 acres under government control. Federal officials
who have been talking with tribal leaders recently have indicated
that they are willing to give the tribe more land, but only if the
Pataxo move to another area and relinquish their claims to the
park.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataxo distrust such promises, particularly older members of
the tribe like Manoel Goncalves dos Santos, 74. ``We helped the
first surveyors who came to demarcate the national park, because
they told us we would get this land,'' he recalled of the event in
the early 1940s. ``But when they were finished, we were driven away
and told we had to stay out of the park.''
</P>
<P>
   After that expulsion, and the dispersal that came after a clash
with the Bahia state police in 1951, the Pataxo gradually lost
their language and were reduced to selling handicrafts at the
park's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1960s some government documents have even referred to
the tribe not as Indians, but as ``caboclos,'' a term applied to
people of mixed race and hillbillies.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Pataxo continue to struggle to maintain their
identity as a people and still regard Monte Pascoal as ``sacred to
us,'' said Oziel Santana Ferreira, a village chief. ``It is our
brother, and the forest is our mother,'' he said. ``We know every
cave and waterfall, our ancestors are buried here and this is where
our old folks have always performed their songs and rituals, so we
cannot leave here.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Pataxo are demanding now is the entire 138,000 acres
that was initially set aside for the park, most of which ended up
in the hands of ranchers and other ``private interests that had the
political connections we have never had,'' Braz said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataxo leaders say they need more land because their population
has exploded, from a few hundred in the early 1950s to more than
6,000 today, but they are being resisted by local landowners.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataxo's seizure of the park has also created a quandary for
Brazil's environmentalist groups. Though they normally support
Indian causes, on the theory that indigenous people are proven
stewards of nature, the park is a sanctuary that harbors one of the
last stands of virgin Atlantic rain forest, including once
plentiful but now rare species like the Brazilwood tree, which gave
this country its name.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant portion of the depredations this park has
suffered are due to the Indians,'' complained Silvio da Cruz
Freire, the park's acting director, ``so for them to suddenly
present themselves as protectors of the environment flies in the
face of reality. I can't remember a time when there haven't been
Indians inside the park burning trees to plant their crops or
cutting them down to use in making their handicrafts.''
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists also worry that the Pataxo case could
send the wrong signal to other groups, ranging from ranchers to
miners, that covet the riches contained in other, more remote and
less policed national parks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The law clearly states that no one can form a residential
community in a national park,'' Santana said, ``and the fear among
nongovernmental organizations is that this could set a dangerous
precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Pataxo argue that they are taking better care of the
park than the government ever did. ``The park guards were always
taking bribes to let hunters and wood gatherers come in,'' said
Aliso Coelho, a member of the Pataxo security team that, armed with
clubs and bows and arrows, now controls access to the park. ``But
we have captured them and turned them over to police.''
</P>
<P>
   Disruption to normal activities within the park has been
minimal, because it has been closed to the public since February.
That step was taken, Freire said, ``in order to carry out
improvements to the visitor center and expansions of services like
water and electricity, with the idea that we would reopen in time
for the 500th anniversary commemorations.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions in the region rose in mid-November, though, when in
violation of a law that limits Indian affairs to the federal
police, a truckload of state police officers was dispatched to a
Pataxo village about 100 miles north of here for reasons that are
still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   After the troops stopped to remove a barrier from a road, two
officers were shot and killed. The police accuse the Pataxo of the
killings, but tribal leaders deny any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no danger of any violence in the park itself, because
that is a different situation,'' said Cleto de Lima e Silva, an
official of the local office of the National Indian Foundation, the
Brazilian government agency that deals with indigenous peoples.
``The government is directly involved, and the government wants to
keep everyone calm so that we can resolve this in peace.''

JUSTICES APPEAR SPLIT IN PLAYBOY TV CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for the Clinton administration and the
Playboy channel squared off before the Supreme Court on Tuesday
over whether the U.S. government can order cable television
operators to fully block sexually explicit channels from reaching
nonsubscribers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   The high court appeared to be as split as the attorneys during
the hourlong argument.
</P>
<P>
   Some justices showed support for the government's position that
the controversial demand on cable companies prevents curious,
impressionable children from glimpsing lewd television images that
remain visible even when the scenes are scrambled for
nonsubscribers. Justice Antonin Scalia, for example, said the
graphic images could be barred as ``obscene.''
</P>
<P>
   Other justices appeared to side with Playboy Entertainment Group
Inc. The media conglomerate, which provides sexually explicit
programming, said the federal law calling for the cable restriction
violates the company's First Amendment right of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The high court is expected to render its decision in the case,
United States vs. Playboy Entertainment Group Inc., by July.
</P>
<P>
   In other Supreme Court action Tuesday, Justice John Paul Stevens
barred Illinois and Wisconsin from enforcing laws prohibiting
late-term, ``partial-birth'' abortions, at least for now. Stevens
granted a request from abortion providers that he temporarily block
enforcement of the states' laws until the Supreme Court has a
chance to review whether the statutes are constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The Playboy case addressed the constitutionality of a provision
of the 1996 Telecommunications Act that addresses cable-television
operators who provide ``sexually explicit adult programming.''
</P>
<P>
   The law, which the Clinton administration is defending, requires
these operators to ``fully scramble or otherwise fully block the
video and audio portion of such (programming) so that one not a
subscriber ... does not receive it.'' Operators who refuse to
scramble the programs can air them only between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
when children are unlikely to view them.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for Delaware
agreed with Playboy's challenge to the law, ruling last December
that the federal government went too far in its effort to protect
children from being exposed to lewd television scenes. The law, by
requiring that images be blacked out to all nonsubscribers, targets
not only children but adults, who are free to view sexually
explicit material so long as it is not obscene, the district court
ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications law allows losing parties, in this case
the federal government, to appeal a district court decision
directly to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Solicitor General James Feldman, pressing the
Clinton administration's appeal, urged the high court to reinstate
the law as a constitutionally permissible way to protect children.
He said the government has a ``compelling interest'' in protecting
impressionable young minds from glimpsing pornography and that the
justices should defer to Congress' limited restriction on the
freedom of cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman said lawmakers made a ``reasonable accommodation'' to
Playboy's First Amendment concerns by allowing the station to air
scrambled images of its shows to nonsubscribers during the late
night and early morning hours.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia, while sympathetic to the government's argument, said
Congress might not have gone far enough to protect children.
</P>
<P>
   The justice said he assigned law clerks to watch tapes of the
scrambled images, known as ``signal bleed,'' and report back to him
in writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't even read the descriptions in public,'' Scalia
said. ``It seems to me obscenity.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, by contrast, expressed concern that
the federal government was acting as a ``super parent'' by
requiring sexually oriented cable stations to totally block their
signals.
</P>
<P>
   But Feldman responded that parents are not always available or
aware of the images being broadcast and, hence, cannot always
protect their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parental consent cannot be ensured simply because of a
parent's failure to act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy's lawyer, Robert Corn-Revere, assailed the cable
restriction as ``regulatory overkill.'' He called the law ``a
blanket, across the board'' First Amendment restriction that makes
no distinction between hard-core pornography and explicit safe-sex
public-service announcements.
</P>
<P>
   But Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Stephen G. Breyer said the
law helps working parents, who are often not at home, to protect
their children from sexually explicit images.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Corn-Revere of Washington said the cable
restriction, if upheld, might lead to other federal intrusions on
the freedom of adults to decide what they want to see on emerging
technologies, such as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens appeared to bemoan the declining standards of decency
not just on cable but on broadcast television.
</P>
<P>
   ``You (hear) a lot of strong language on WGN,'' Stevens said,
referring to a popular Chicago television station that is available
on cable. ``You can hear the language ... on television any night
of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   With regard to the Illinois and Wisconsin partial-birth abortion
restrictions, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 5-4 last
month to uphold the state laws as constitutional restrictions on
the freedom of women to terminate their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, by granting the stay, allowed partial-birth abortions
to continue to be performed in the two states. The stay will remain
in effect unless and until the Supreme Court either refuses to hear
an appeal of the 7th Circuit decision or votes to uphold that
ruling, said Stevens, the justice assigned to oversee that circuit,
which covers Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Under the procedure, a fetus is partially delivered through the
birth canal. An incision is made in the base of the skull and its
contents are drained.
</P>
<P>
   The Wisconsin law calls for a life sentence for anyone
performing the controversial procedure except to save the woman's
life. The Illinois law makes performing a partial-birth abortion a
felony.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down
as unconstitutional similar partial-birth abortion restrictions in
Nebraska, Arkansas and Iowa. The dispute between the 7th and 8th
circuits increases the likelihood that the court will consider the
issue and decide whether the restrictions are constitutional.

GEORGIA, RAMS LIVING LARGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's football saturated edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we should all get comfortable with the idea of Georgia
Frontiere walking the sidelines during the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks after most analysts threw up their hands trying to
predict what NFL teams were playoff-bound, the picture has cleared
considerably and you can now separate the contenders and the
dreamers.
</P>
<P>
   And our beloved Los Angeles Rams are living large. It would take
the flameout of the millooneynium to keep the Rams from the
playoffs and a Super Bowl berth, a tumble along the lines of the
Phillies' 1964 pratfall.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-2 Rams have games left with five non-factors at this stage
of the season, Carolina, New Orleans, New York Giants, Chicago and
Philadelphia. They can clinch the NFC West with a win Sunday, and
with no other NFC team better than 7-4, the Rams should clinch a
first round playoff bye and home field throughout the playoffs
before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   That's a massive advantage for a team has great team speed and
plays on a rug. Plus, all the other NFC contenders have at least
one notable flaw in their game. It would take a major change in the
profile of Dallas (age), Minnesota (horrible pass defense) and
Tampa Bay (a weak offense) to see them beating the Rams. ...
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the NFC playoff hunt:
</P>
<P>
   NFC West:
</P>
<P>
   Rams clinch with a win at Carolina Sunday. Everyone else is
playing for draft position.
</P>
<P>
   NFC East:
</P>
<P>
   Washington may lead at 7-4, but the Redskins have games left at
Detroit, at Indianapolis and home with Miami. Dallas is 6-5, and if
they can past slumping New England this week, they have the Eagles,
Jets, Saints and Giants left, and three of them at home. They also
hold the tiebreaker against the Redskins. Arizona and New York
(both 5-6) are tricking their fans by saying they still are alive.
</P>
<P>
   NFC Central:
</P>
<P>
   Four playoff teams could emerge from here. Detroit, Minnesota
and Tampa (all 7-4) need only go 3-2 to finish 10-6, and 6-5 Green
Bay has games with Chicago, Carolina and Arizona left. Tampa gets
the Vikes, Lions and Pack at home, and Detroit must also visit
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   But all four teams have questions. Detroit needs a healthy
Charlie Batch, Minnesota has the NFL worst pass defense, Trent
Dilfer's injury forces Tampa to use rookie Shaun King, and the
Packers are erratic.
</P>
<P>
   Projection: St. Louis (West) and Dallas (East) get byes. Detroit
wins tiebreaker for Central. First round: Green Bay at Detroit,
Minnesota at Tampa. ...
</P>
<P>
   The AFC is clearly the better conference this season. Six teams
already have eight wins or more in hand, and the conference holds a
28-18 edge on the NFC in head-to-head play. Seven of the NFC's 18
wins can be traced to California (San Diego) and Ohio (Cleveland,
Cincinnati), too.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few NFC teams are having any rushing success, compared to
the AFC, where seven teams are averaging 114 rushing yards or more
per game. The AFC has better run defenses, too. It would be a
surprise if any of those six teams were to fall out of the
playoffs. But Miami and Seattle are still having problems running
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   AFC Central:
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville (10-1) and Tennessee (9-2) meet the day after
Christmas to decide the division title. There isn't a single
winning team left on either team's schedule. The wild card team
here could have a better record than the other two division champs.
</P>
<P>
   AFC West:
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City (6-5) can't lose another game, because 10-6 may not
be good enough for a wild card berth and Seattle (8-3) has games
left with the Raiders, Chargers, Broncos and Jets.
</P>
<P>
   AFC East:
</P>
<P>
   The Colts (9-2) still have road games at Miami and Buffalo, but
also a freebie at Cleveland. Buffalo's (8-4) next three games are
against the Giants, Cards and sinking Pats. Miami gets three of its
last five at home, but has both games left against the Jets, who
would love to play spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   Projection: Jacksonville (Central) and Buffalo (East) get first
round byes. Seattle wins the West. First round games send Miami at
Seattle and Indianapolis at Tennessee in perhaps the toughest first
round game ever. ...
</P>
<P>
   The rate of close games has slowed some the last two weeks,
especially last weekend, when there were a lot of heavy favorites
and eight games were decided by eight points or more.
</P>
<P>
   In 173 games this season, 85 of them have been decided by a
touchdown or less, or 49 percent. And 51 of those 85 were decided
by a field goal or less, or almost 30 percent of all games. ...
</P>
<P>
   Some stats to noodle with while waiting for the stretch run:
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is offensive, and in a bad way. Only 13 teams are
averaging two or more offensive touchdowns a game. But the flip
side is the rampant rate of touchdowns being scored by defenses.
There are 12 teams with three or more defensive scores, including
Kansas City (6), Dallas (5), San Francisco (5), and Washington, St.
Louis, Jacksonville (all 4), and only four defenses haven't scored,
Atlanta, Carolina, Cleveland and Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis (7-0), Jacksonville (7-0) and St. Louis (9-0) are
all unbeaten in games decided by a touchdown or more. Conversely,
Atlanta (0-6), Cincinnati (0-8), Cleveland (0-8), New York Giants
(1-4), and San Francisco (1-7) have two wins between in games
decided by seven or more points. San Diego is 3-6.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (11), Oakland (10), Minnesota (8), New England (8),
Baltimore (8) and Philadelphia (8) have played the most close games
this season (seven points or less).
</P>
<P>
   If you believe the ability to win close games is an indicator,
then you'll back the playoff fortunes of Miami (5-1 in close games)
and Tennessee (6-1), and peel off Dallas (1-3) and St. Louis (0-2).
</P>
<P>
   Live dogs for those who back their predictions with their
wallet: Chicago (9-1), Detroit (6-2), Baltimore (5-2), Indianapolis
(6-0) and Oakland (4-2). But Indy's dog days are likely over, and
the Raiders, after Sunday's crushing loss to K.C., are the team
most likely to e-mail the rest of their season.

RUSSIANS CLAIM TO HAVE CAUGHT U.S. SPY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian officials said Tuesday that they had caught an
American spy as she was preparing to meet with her Russian
informant and that they had confiscated an array of sophisticated
espionage equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration acknowledged that an American
diplomat was briefly detained in Moscow in an ``incident,'' but
declined to comment on Russian charges that the diplomat was a spy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than confirming that there was an incident involving an
American working at the U.S. Embassy, I'm not going to comment on
alleged intelligence matters,'' State Department spokesman James
Rubin told reporters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The episode came just as a U.S. Navy enlisted man was being
charged with passing secrets about American decoding programs to
Russia, officials said. Petty Officer 1st class Daniel King, 40,
who had worked at a Navy decoding office at Fort Meade, Md., is
being held in military custody in Quantico, Va., awaiting a hearing
on espionage charges.
</P>
<P>
   This week's renewal of Cold War-style spy skirmishes between
Moscow and Washington has increased the strains between the two
nations, which are already at odds over Russia's war in Chechnya,
NATO's war with Yugoslavia and Washington's plan to erect a limited
anti-missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   It has also shown the renewed confidence of the FSB, Russia's
internal security service, which summoned Russian reporters to
boast about its success in unmasking American agents and displayed
a photograph of the alleged spy: a low-level diplomat at the U.S.
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has long maintained an intelligence station in the
American Embassy in Moscow, and its officers work under diplomatic
cover, posing as State Department employees. CIA officials refused
to comment on the latest flap in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the end to the Cold War, Russia and the United
States have continued to spy on each other. Russian intelligence
services have been so active, in fact, that the Clinton
administration asked the Kremlin earlier this year to cut back on
its spying as a goodwill gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin, Russia's prime minister and the leading
candidate to succeed President Boris Yeltsin, is a former senior
intelligence officer, as is his main political rival, Yevgeni
Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Foreign Ministry took Tuesday's spy episode in
stride, saying that it planned to issue an official protest but
that it did not expect the incident to seriously hurt
American-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope and expect that this should not interfere with
relations between the United States and Russia,'' Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov said. ``But certainly such episodes do not
help improve the climate and atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the FSB was anxious to talk about its counterintelligence
efforts for a prime-time Russian television audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians identified the accused spy as Cheri Leberknight,
and asserted that she was a CIA officer who was working under cover
as a second secretary at the American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   They charged that she had been trying to obtain secret Russian
military documents when she was detained Monday night in northern
Moscow. Ms. Leberknight, who enjoys diplomatic immunity, was turned
over to the American Embassy by Russian authorities and is expected
to leave Moscow shortly.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Russian account, Russian counterintelligence
agents tracked Ms. Leberknight as she prepared to meet a Russian
contact. Aleksandr Zdanovich, a spokesman for the FSB, said her
goal was to obtain ``state secrets about our military-strategic
plans and military-strategic complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials did not say specifically what type of
documents were being sought. Even with its economic woes, Russia
retains a powerful nuclear arsenal and is building new long-range
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said that Ms. Leberknight carried a map
showing her meeting point and was equipped with a variety of
devices to determine if she was under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   CIA officers have traditionally used high-tech equipment to
detect whether they are under surveillance. Their equipment could
determine if nearby radio communications increase when the CIA
officer is on the move, which would be a sign that the officer is
being followed. It is unclear whether the diplomat actually was
found to be carrying such equipment, however.
</P>
<P>
   Zdanovich showed a photograph said to be of Ms. Leberknight.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leberknight was brought to FSB headquarters in downtown
Moscow, but refused to talk, Russian officials say. She was later
turned over to the counsel at the American Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word Tuesday night if Russian officials had also
arrested a Russian who might have been in contact with the United
States as part of an alleged espionage operation. The FSB said,
however, that its investigation was continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials insisted that there was no connection between
this case and the arrest of the Navy enlisted man.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a response,'' Zdanovich told a Russian television
interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's security service has been very active in recent months.
It arrested a Russian researcher, who was later charged with
revealing military secrets, and pursued investigations against
Russian environmentalists who have investigated the dumping of
nuclear waste at sea.

 Matthew Gurewitsch writes about the arts for The Wall Street
Journal and other publications.  
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``As a little boy of 3 or 4, I became lame,'' Gian Carlo Menotti
says. ``Something was wrong with my right leg. There are pictures
of me being pulled around in a little wagon. The doctors didn't
know what to do. So my nanny took me to the miraculous Madonna at
Sacro Monte in Varese, the priest blessed me, and I walked. But the
only thing I really remember from that wonderful day is that my
nanny took me to lunch, and it was the first time I ate a pickle. I
still like pickles.''
</P>
<P>
   At 88, Menotti, the Italian-born composer, director and
librettist, claims to tire more easily than of old and apologizes
for memory lapses, but his enjoyment of life remains as evident as
his recall, and he tells stories charmingly. This jesting
reminiscence complements better-known accounts of the genesis of
``Amahl and the Night Visitors,'' the most popular not only of
(italics)his(end italics) operas but probably of all operas.
</P>
<P>
   As he told the tale in an essay for the original-cast recording
on RCA Victor, he had accepted a commission to write a Christmas
opera for the National Broadcasting Co. By November, he was still
at a loss for a subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I offered to give back the money,'' Menotti says now. ``It
wasn't very much. A thousand dollars, I think.'' NBC turned him
down.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the official record. Strolling ``gloomily'' through
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the tardy composer chanced on the
``Adoration of the Magi,'' then (but no longer) attributed to
Hieronymus Bosch. The Magi, or Three Kings, Italy's answer to our
Santa Claus, were to be his Night Visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The boy Gian Carlo had never actually encountered the Three
Kings, the grown-up Menotti confessed in the essay: ``We would
always fall asleep just before they arrived. But I do remember
hearing them. I remember the weird cadence of their song in the
dark distance; I remember the brittle sound of the camels' hooves
crushing the frozen snow, and I remember the mysterious tinkling of
their silver bridles.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could fail to hear those memories playing through the score?
Now we can account as well for the crippled Amahl and his
miraculous cure. How the opera could have been created and produced
in less than two months is another question. Fortunately, Menotti
had a little help. ``The music was all sketched out, but I was late
with the orchestration,'' he reveals. ``Samuel Barber said, `For
God's sake, let me help.' So the last page of the manuscript was
written in his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost the manuscript,'' Menotti continues. ``What a
shame!'' It went on the block at Parke-Bernet in an auction to
raise money for the Festival of Two Worlds, which Menotti founded
in the Italian hill town of Spoleto in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Rebekah Harkness, an heiress and patron of the arts, was the
successful bidder. Shortly before she died, Menotti called to ask
whether he could have it or buy it back. ```Yes,' she said, `but I
have to find it,''' he recalls. ``Then she died, and it was never
found. Heaven knows who stole it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost, too, is the only kinescope of the opera's premiere, on
Dec. 24, 1951. Robert W. Sarnoff, the chairman of NBC's parent
corporation, RCA, was showing it to someone in his office, Menotti
says, and inadvertently erased it: a technologically suspect
explanation for a result apparently not in dispute. Never mind. The
occasion lives in history on many counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first color program ever on TV,'' Menotti notes,
not bragging but indulging the curiosity of a new acquaintance who
(like the opera's young protagonist) refuses to stop asking
questions. ``It was the first opera written for TV. It was reviewed
on the first page of The New York Times. It was the first program
on the Hallmark Hall of Fame. It was presented by Sarah Churchill,
daughter of Sir Winston.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Menotti was 40 at the time. The television director Kirk
Browning, whose name is now synonymous with the long-running PBS
series ``Live From Lincoln Center,'' was standing behind the
cameras. Carmen de Lavallade and the choreographic luminaries-to-be
John Butler, Paul Taylor and Glen Tetley danced the sprightly pas
de quatre in honor of the Three Kings. Thomas Schippers conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Although no audience was present in the studio, Arturo
Toscanini, that most irascible of maestros, had looked in on
rehearsals and been moved to tears. But who could have predicted
the phenomenon Menotti's musical Christmas card to America would
become?
</P>
<P>
   These days, G. Schirmer, the composer's publisher, accounts a
holiday-season tally of 500 performances merely business as usual.
Menotti estimates that ``Amahl'' has been heard in more than 40
languages, including Chinese, Dutch and Portuguese, as far afield
as India, Japan and Australia. Caroline Kennedy sang one of the
kings _ Melchior or Balthasar, Menotti recalls _ at school in an
all-girl cast. The composer attended with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Is ``Amahl'' the creator's favorite among his creations?
</P>
<P>
   ```The Saint of Bleecker Street' is my favorite,'' Menotti
replies. ``I have great affection for `Amahl' but also many sad
memories. The first Amahl, Chet Allen, became so much Amahl that he
could never return to real life. He became obsessed. He was in Life
magazine, in Time. He was called to Hollywood to make a film, and
he didn't want to do it. He only wanted to be Amahl. His parents
called me in Paris. `Please, convince him to do the film,' they
begged me. `We're poor. We need the money.' I spoke to him. It was
a mistake. I told him, `You have to think of your family.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So he went. It was a role for a boy soprano, but in the middle
of the filming, he lost his voice. It changed. It was a terrible
shock. He went home to Ohio and got very fat. He went to a
psychologist. I called him to Spoleto and gave him the role of Toby
in `The Medium.' I tried to help. He was all right in the role, but
he only wanted to be Amahl and never wanted to go home. In his 20s,
he got married and had a daughter. Then he committed suicide. He
had a very silly mother. She loved to be the center of everything.
I don't think she loved her son very much. That's one reason I
don't love the opera so much.''
</P>
<P>
   A part from these associations, Menotti feels that ``Amahl,'' as
the first of his six children's operas, is the least successful in
reaching children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other five, children really enjoy,'' he says. ``In
`Amahl,' they get bored. They don't like the Mother's aria. They
don't like the quartet, because they don't like people singing at
the same time. They want to understand the words. Through `Amahl,'
I learned to write an opera for children. At the premieres, I
always watch the audience. If a child asks to go to the bathroom, I
know I've failed. With the other five operas, they never do. But
with `Amahl,' which is musically more complicated, there's always
someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, I love `Amahl' very much, because so many people say to
me, `I came to love opera through ``Amahl.''' Men with beards and
four children come to me and say, `I sang Amahl.''' How often could
Mozart, Verdi or Puccini have experienced the like? Any day now,
some of those men with beards will be coaching their grandsons in
the part.

WHAT'S IN A CYBER NAME? $7.5 MILLION FOR THE RIGHT ADDRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas)   (bl)  
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In what is believed to be the highest price ever
paid for an Internet address, a company here is paying $7.5 million
for the rights to the domain name business.com.
</P>
<P>
   The price is more than twice the previous known record paid for
an Internet domain name _ the $3.3 million that Compaq Computer
Corp. paid last year to buy altavista.com, the name of its search
engine. Compaq purchased the address from a man in San Jose, who
had registered the name to use for his software company.
</P>
<P>
   The seller of business.com, a Houston entrepreneur named Marc
Ostrofsky, bought the name in 1997 from an Internet service
provider in Europe for $150,000. His sale Tuesday is the latest
example of a kind of land-rush mentality on the Internet, in which
speculators and entrepreneurs have been staking claims to domain
names, the cyberspace equivalent of real estate, in hopes that the
addresses will appreciate in value.
</P>
<P>
   The purchaser of the name business.com is Ecompanies, an
``incubator'' that aims to start numerous Internet companies. It
will use the name for what it says will be a broad directory of Web
services available to businesses that it plans to start next year.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Winebaum, a co-founder of Ecompanies, said the price was
not too high for a brand name, given that Web-based companies are
spending more than $1 million for a 30-second commercial during the
Super Bowl to make their names known.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually think the name means a lot,'' said Winebaum, who
ran Walt Disney Co.'s Web business before starting Ecompanies
earlier this year with Sky Dayton, the founder of Earthlink
Network, an Internet service provider. ``It captures what I think
we're building,'' he added. ``I would rather have it like that than
trying to spend a lot to figure out what the brand stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Friedman, an Internet analyst with Goldman Sachs, said
business-to-business electronic commerce could be a $1.5 trillion
business in five years. Given the potential, he said, ``to have one
of the marquis names in that business could be a favorable return
on invested capital.''
</P>
<P>
   But Allen Adamson, managing director of Landor Associates, a
leading consultant on branding, said such generic names lack
lasting value. ``It's a huge amount of money for something that
might be a commodity in six months,'' he said. ``Owning generic
domain names will not be a long term play in branding and
marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can register a domain name not already in use for $70 for
two years from Network Solutions, a company chartered by the U.S.
government to supervise the system. Speculators and entrepreneurs,
sometimes called ``cybersquatters'' have taken to registering names
that might be wanted by others in hopes of selling them for a big
profit. Some names are being sold through Web auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   But million-dollar deals are rare. The name wine.com was
purchased for $3 million, Wallstreet.com for $1.03 million and
drugs.com for $823,000 according to GreatDomains.com, a Website
that provides a marketplace for buying and selling domain names.
But most prices are far less. An entrepreneur in California
demanded that Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. pay $75,000 for a
name the brokerage wants to use for its online stock trading
service. Morgan Stanley offered to pay $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ostrofsky owns Multimedia Publishing Corp., which published
telecommunications magazines and ran trade shows. He sold those
businesses recently to Primedia for $35 million and said he planned
to use that money to start Web companies. He was planning a
business-oriented Internet site using business.com but also was
willing to sell the name and shopped it around.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to know when to hold them and when to fold them,''
he said, adding that he believed Winebaum would do a better job
developing a Web site than he would. He and Winebaum said there
were several bidders for the domain, though they would not name
them.
</P>
<P>
   Ostrofsky, 38, said he owns more than 100 domain names, most
obtained for just $70. When he paid the $150,000 for business.com,
he said, ``I had more than my fair share of people telling me I was
out of my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Ostrofsky said he had previously sold the name eflowers.com to
Flowers Direct for $25,000 plus 50 cents from every transaction
made on the site. As part of the deal, Ostrofsky's wife will get
flowers once a month for the rest of her life.

IGNORING SCANDAL AND ECONOMICS, MALAYSIANS RETAIN MAHATHIR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Like other nations, Malaysia has a
national anthem. But it also has a theme song, played repeatedly in
the recent election campaign, Frank Sinatra's ``My Way.''
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant, cranky, put-up-your dukes prime minister, Dr.
Mahathir Mohamad, prides himself on defying just about everybody
and in creating a rather eccentric but mostly successful
modernizing nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have achieved whatever we have achieved according to the
Sinatra principle,'' he said shortly before winning a new five-year
term in a parliamentary election on Monday. ``We have done it our
own way.''
</P>
<P>
   What Malaysians did was to reject, for the most part, the type
of change that has toppled leaders around Asia since the economic
crisis hit the region more than two years ago. They returned
Mahathir to office after 18 years in power with a huge
parliamentary majority at a time when Indonesia, South Korea and
Thailand have responded to the economic crisis with political
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir achieved his victory despite economic hardship and a
political scandal that damaged his crucial arguments of having
brought stability and well-being to this ethnically divided nation.
Analysts said part of the reason was the character of the
electorate, carefully balanced among a Malay majority and Chinese
and Indian minorities. It fears instability and has been horrified
by the upheavals that have gripped nearby Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the opposition did not offer a credible alternative
to the experienced, highly organized governing coalition, which is
anchored by Mahathir's party, Umno. A reformist movement that was
spawned by the ouster and trial of Mahathir's deputy, Anwar
Ibrahim, raised issues of democracy and openness but was rejected
by voters, winning 5 seats in the 193-seat Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But the election did shift the political ground in ways that
will be played out in the coming years. It gave a significant push
to the Islamic party, Pas, which increased its Parliament seats, to
27 from 8, and swept two state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   The voting took 8 of the 15 seats in the prime minister's home
state, Kedah, where his own popular vote fell, by preliminary
estimates, to 10,000 votes from 17,000.
</P>
<P>
   The political struggle is quite likely to refocus from the
complaints of the democratic reformists to a struggle between
secular and Islamic political leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In a predawn victory statement Tuesday, Mahathir offered a hand
of cooperation to the Islamic party, saying: ``We would be very
glad to work with the opposition party outside of politics. Of
course, politically we will disagree with them. But there are other
areas where we can agree with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic party leader, Fadzil Noor, took a combative tone
Tuesday, declaring that as long as the governing coalition
``continues with its wrongdoings and does not repent, this wind of
change will blow to other states as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The weakening of Mahathir's grip on the states where Pas is
strong, the ethnic Malay heartland in the north, also potentially
weakens his control of his party. In another setback, both real and
symbolic, four Umno cabinet ministers lost their parliamentary
seats.
</P>
<P>
   It is often said that the real election in Malaysia is not the
parliamentary vote, which Umno has won in every election since the
founding of Malaysia in 1957, but the party's leadership vote. That
is due next year, and the setbacks in the fine print of the big
victory on Monday could fuel a challenge to Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts pointed out that the three senior party members who
could potentially raise a challenge also met with setbacks and
might not be operating from positions of strength. Once again,
Mahathir may have found his own way to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest loser on Monday was the man who many thought
would by now be stepping in as prime minister, Anwar. For years, he
was Mahathir's anointed successor, until a falling out last year
that led to his dismissal and trial on charges of corruption and
sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting crisis ignited the reform movement, which for the
first time produced an opposition alliance for an election. But it
was the Islamic party, and not Anwar's democrats, who were the main
beneficiaries of that alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah, was one of the five reform candidates
to win a seat in Parliament. Anwar's sodomy trial, adjourned to
keep him out of the public eye during the campaign, can resume. But
it will have lost much of its larger political significance, in
view of the voters' rejection of his supporters and of their reform
movement.

FORMER GERMAN CHANCELLOR ADMITS TO USE OF SECRET PARTY FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 6th graf to add info on impact of admission; adds 850 wds to
end of original text with implications for Christian Democrats and
ruling party, plus details on use and set up of secret accounts.)

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl,
who has been facing widening accusations of having run illegal
political slush funds, admitted Tuesday that he had used cash from
secret bank accounts to help local branches of his party, the
Christian Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's admission aggravated a nationwide uproar that began three
weeks ago, after disclosures that the party's former treasurer
secretly accepted about $530,000 from an arms merchant in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, prosecutors have turned up evidence that Kohl's
party maintained numerous secret bank accounts that may have been
used to accept illegal political contributions from business
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl engineered the reunification of Germany and reigned as
chancellor for 16 years before losing an election last year. Until
Tuesday, he had dismissed all the allegations as ``a lot of noise
about nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of his own former colleagues have gone public with
their own allegations in the last few days. Heiner Geissler, who
was general secretary of the Christian Democratic Union from 1977
until 1989, said on Monday that he had repeatedly argued with Kohl
about the secret accounts and that the former chancellor knew
everything about them.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Christian Democratic leaders acknowledged that there
may indeed have been improper financial dealings and that these may
have persisted until as recently as a year ago. There have been no
allegations so far that individual political leaders enriched
themselves. The main question is whether the party has been selling
influence.
</P>
<P>
   In an uncharacteristically contrite written statement, Kohl
admitted that he had used secret accounts to provide financial
support for local party branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have, as chairman of the party, deemed as necessary the
confidential treatment of certain issues, such as special payments
to party branches and associations,'' Kohl said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl said it was reasonable to describe the secret accounts as
having been ``managed separately'' from those of the party's normal
federal treasury. He said he regretted that he may have allowed a
``lack of transparency'' in party finances and perhaps even a
violation of the party's own rules. ``That is not what I wanted,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are investigating what appears to be a network of
accounts. The parliament plans to establish a special investigative
committee on Thursday. And the Christian Democratic Union has
itself hired the accounting firm of Ernst &AMP; Young to examine its
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible that not all the party rules were adhered to,''
said Wolfgang Schauble, Kohl's successor as chairman of the
Christian Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``No one enriched themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation could lead to criminal charges against some
Christian Democratic officials. Under German law, political parties
are required to disclose publicly all contributions and their
sources. Prosecutors are also investigating whether people who
either accepted or channeled covert contributions evaded taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The most damaging allegation _ but also the most difficult to
prove _ is that Kohl and other party leaders sold favors for large
sums of money.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the spreading revelations threaten to tarnish
Kohl's reputation as the statesman who reunified Germany and was
Europe's most formidable political leader throughout the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   They will also deal a major political blow to the Christian
Democrats, who were just beginning to recover from their
devastating electoral defeat last year to the Social Democratic
Party of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first allegations surfaced in early November as a result of
a long-running investigation into tax evasion by Walther Leisler
Kiep, who served as the Christian Democrats' treasurer for many
years, until 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Tax investigators charged that Kiep had failed to pay taxes
after receiving 1 million marks from an arms trader, Karlheinz
Schreiber. At the time, Schreiber was trying to get government
approval for the sale of tanks to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber, whom the German authorities are trying to extradite
from Canada, reportedly handed Kiep a suitcase filled with cash.
Kiep admitted receiving the money but insisted that he had merely
put it in a special party-controlled bank account.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper,
Kiep said he knew Schreiber ``wanted to do something good for the
party'' but had no idea that 1 million marks would be handed over.
</P>
<P>
   The German government approved the sale of the tanks, and the
investigation focuses on whether there was a quid pro quo. Party
officials say, though, that the sale was logical because Germany
was not sending troops to the Persian Gulf during the military
campaign against Iraq, and the sale of tanks was a way to provide
support.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have now uncovered a number of other unofficial bank
accounts that also appear to have been means for receiving a wide
variety of political contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Schauble, the Christian Democrats' current chairman, said
Tuesday that there appear to have been a number of other unofficial
accounts during the 1990s. The last was shut down at the end of
1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such accounts are not in themselves illegal, nor are large
political contributions. The legal issue is whether the
contributions were properly reported and whether the money was used
to buy influence.
</P>
<P>
   Geissler, the party's longtime general secretary, has alleged
that Kohl used the accounts to buy the political loyalty of local
and regional party officials.
</P>
<P>
   But Geissler, an acerbic and cerebral politician who is almost a
mirror opposite of the backslapping Kohl, has been a sworn enemy of
the former chancellor for years now.
</P>
<P>
   For Germany's governing Social Democrats and for Schroeder, the
swirl of new charges are a welcome relief from their own recent
troubles. The Social Democrats have been battered in a series of
regional elections from the Rhineland to Berlin to Hesse, the state
that contains Frankfurt and Germany's main financial center.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Struck, a Social Democratic Party leader in parliament,
said allegations will be pursued wherever they may lead. ``The
investigating committee will have to determine whether there was
influence exerted on the decisions of the federal government,'' he
said Tuesday. ``One can't simply believe what Kohl says.''

CLINTON IMPLEMENTS IMPROVED FAMILY LEAVE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration unveiled Tuesday an experimental
program that will allow states to expand unemployment insurance
benefits to include new parents on leave, a plan hailed by
workplace advocates as a boon to poor working parents and opposed
by critics who fear the plan would deplete individual states'
jobless funds.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new parental regulations proposed by the President,
along with model state legislation, each state will be able to
develop programs offering working parents time off with pay during
the first year after the birth of a baby or an adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal proposal recommends 12 weeks' paid leave,
states could offer as much as 26 weeks. Currently, unemployment
benefits average about $200 per week and are paid for a maximum of
26 weeks, the US Labor Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Halas, a senior employment lawyer at Greater Boston Legal
Services, who was instrumental in introducing two similar bills to
the Massachusetts Legislature, said the new federal regulations
were an important first step.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is timely, particularly for low-income families for whom
welfare once served as the poor woman's paid parental leave,'' said
Halas. ``There was a question as to whether this kind of change to
the unemployment insurance benefit system would pass muster under
federal unemployment law.''
</P>
<P>
   According to advocates, Clinton modeled his plan on the two
bills that have been introduced in Massachusetts. The bills, one in
the Senate and the other in the House, would offer workers on leave
50 percent of their weekly wage, capping compensation at about 57.5
percent of the average weekly wage in the state. Last year, that
cap would have been $402 per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving states the flexibility to experiment with paid
employment leave is one of the best things we can do to strengthen
our families and help new mothers and fathers meet their
responsibilities both at home and at work,'' Clinton said at a
press conference in the Oval Office, where he was joined by three
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children need this time to bond with their parents, and
parents need this time to nurture their children,'' US Senator
Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA) said. ``But all too often parents cannot
afford to take the unpaid leave that the current law permits. As
recent studies have shown, the loss of a paycheck during unpaid
leave prevents millions of others from taking a leave when they
need it. President Clinton's initiative today is a giant step
towards solving that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman estimated the maximum total cost
of implementing initial programs in four states, including
Massachusetts, would be $68 million a year, depending on the length
of time offered working new parents and the way the states
structure their programs.
</P>
<P>
   The four states, Massachusetts, Vermont, Maryland, and
Washington, are among the first with legislative proposals similar
to the model bills. There are, potentially, a total of 71,000
working parents who could qualify for paid leave in those states,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But while some state jobless programs are reporting surpluses
because the nation's healthy economy has helped more people find
jobs, there are 20 states whose jobless funds are far from flush
with cash.
</P>
<P>
   Those states, as well as the companies whose taxes enrich the
states' jobless funds, may be unwilling to support a program that
would permit payments for parental or family leave, some observers
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a back-door way to get employers to pay for a
program that the administration wants but can't figure out how to
pay for,'' Randy Johnson, a vice president at the US Chamber of
Commerce, told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ed Potter, president of the Employment Policy
Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C., issued a
statement warning that the administration's proposal could
``undermine the purpose and the solvency of the current
unemployment system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This proposal would, potentially, create a $14 billion to $128
billion annual entitlement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Clinton announced that he had asked the Labor Department
to permit states to offer unemployment insurance benefits to
parents of newborn or recently adopted children who request time
off under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which permits
12 weeks of unpaid leave for employees of firms with 50 or more
workers.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Richard C. Lord, executive vice president of
legislative policy at Associated Industries of Massachusetts, which
represents 5,000 businesses, said such a plan would strip the state
of its competitive edge and would put too great a burdeon on
Massachusetts' $1.8 billion unemployment trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   The federal regulations released Tuesday are important because
they implement the president's executive order, providing payment
to families who need the time off but cannot afford to take unpaid
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Officials noted Tuesday that paid programs adopted as a result
of the new regulations will be regarded as experimental until a
minimum of four states have relied on the program for three years.
At the end of that three-year period, the federal government would
re-examine the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Under the regulations released Tuesday, state legislatures will
determine whether paid parental leave should be adopted and would
also vote on how it should be implemented.

 DOCTORs VS. INSURERS AFFECTS ALL  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A physician protest against Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas
City may mean short-term pain but long-term gain for many area
residents.
</P>
<P>
   As managed care has overtaken the practice of medicine,
physicians have been sorely tested by America's effort to economize
on health care. When it was revealed recently that 1,000 or so area
doctors had declined or delayed signing contracts with the area's
biggest health-care insurer, it was a reminder of the inevitability
of economic trade-offs.
</P>
<P>
   If the differences aren't resolved expeditiously, it could mean
at least temporary inconvenience for those whose doctors are
protesting. Over time, however, it might also mean better care. Any
improvement, however, is likely to come at a price. Who'll pay that
price, though, is a question mark given the private sector's
prevailing method of financing health care.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute turns on reimbursement levels, treatment decision
controls and liability issues. As the system morphed from full
physician control of the process to insurer-imposed limits, docs
increasingly have chafed at restrictions designed to control costs.
As insured patients have become more aware of this health-care
rationing trend, they have begun casting blame. Some blame
insurers, others blame doctors and hospitals, and some blame
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, that is, except those most responsible for the
managed-care revolution, which is to say themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Since most working Americans get their health-care insurance at
the office, companies were forced by skyrocketing health-care
expenses to seek more cost-effective ways to provide this benefit.
The solution that evolved was managed care, which usually involves
fixed-cost coverage per client. If those providing the care can do
so at less than their client-based revenue, they make a profit. If
not, they lose money.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting controls were designed to ensure profits at best,
and a break-even result at worst.
</P>
<P>
   What covered employees and their families have failed to
appreciate, however, is the role they played in this quest for the
cheapest possible health-care insurance. While employers often are
criticized for being stingy, their own bottom-line considerations
dictate how much they can spend on this benefit. This means
employees are routinely required to share the cost.
</P>
<P>
   As most employers have learned, any attempt to increase the
employee's share must be done with the utmost care. Otherwise, they
risk an employee revolt. The result is the lowest-cost way to
finance what's perceived as an adequate level of health-care
coverage. The resulting system makes few happy, but the competing
self-interests make it difficult to create a better world.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, physicians here and elsewhere appear increasingly
ready to force the issue, and Kansas City's imbroglio is only one
such instance. Another example is California, where a group of
doctors has been in a legal battle with Blue Cross for a couple of
years over reduced reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   These showdowns probably are for the best. Whether Americans
realize it or not, physicians are their best advocates when it
comes to forcing the system to sustain acceptable levels of health
care, given the current system of paying for it.

WHEN SINGERS OF THEIR OWN SONGS RECORD OTHERS'  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Anthony DeCurtis is the executive editor of the online music store
CDNow and writes about popular music.  
 By ANTHONY DeCURTIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a 1984 Rolling Stone interview, Bob Dylan complained about
the disappearance of the folk tradition. ``Nowadays, you go to see
a folk singer _ what's the folk singer doin'?'' he asked,
exasperated. ``He's singin' all his own songs. That ain't no folk
singer. Folk singers sing those old folk songs, ballads.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later he returned to his point: ``I was tellin'
somebody that thing about when you go to see a folk singer now, you
hear somebody singin' his own songs. And the person says, `Yeah,
well, you started that.' And in a sense, it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   In every sense, it's true. Dylan started out singing other
people's material, but by the mid '60s, his own songs _ in their
poetic ambition, thematic boldness and sheer length _ had redefined
the possibilities of popular songwriting.
</P>
<P>
   After that it essentially became impossible for any performer
who wanted to be taken seriously _ in rock 'n' roll, as well as
folk _ not to write his own songs. Of course, a singer writing his
own songs was hardly unheard of before Dylan _ Woody Guthrie, Muddy
Waters, Hank Williams, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly and Dylan's
contemporaries, the Beatles, all primarily performed their own
material.
</P>
<P>
   But Dylan's impact was so profound that it gave birth to a
singer-songwriter movement founded on notions about authenticity
derived not from popular music _ where interpretive singers and
professional songwriters had collaborated successfully for decades
_ but from Romantic poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Wordsworth's call for a poetry consisting of ``the real language
of men in a state of vivid sensation'' perfectly describes the
combination of plain-spokenness and emotional urgency that, at
their best, characterized both Dylan's work and that of the
innumerable performers who sought to emulate him. To perform songs
written by others came to be perceived as inherently false, mere
theatrical artifice, as opposed to true self-expression.
</P>
<P>
   These days, of course, with the proliferation of compilations,
soundtracks and tribute albums, cover versions of other people's
songs are increasingly common. The largely commercial logic behind
this is easy to figure out. Why waste one of your own songs on
someone else's project? But what does it mean when artists who are
strongly identified as singer-songwriters record entire albums of
other people's songs?
</P>
<P>
   Two recent releases, ``In Spite of Ourselves'' by John Prine (Oh
Boy OBR-019) and ``I'll Take Care of You'' by Mark Lanegan (Subpop
SP 445), raise that question from contrasting but equally
intriguing vantages. Prine, 53, rose out of the folk scene in
Dylan's wake and thus was among the unfortunate artists burdened
with the ``new Dylan'' tag.
</P>
<P>
   While he has enjoyed intermittent commercial success over the
years, he is probably better known for the versions of his songs
performed by others _ Bonnie Raitt's ``Angel of Montgomery,'' Bette
Midler's ``Hello in There'' _ than for his own renditions.
</P>
<P>
   Lanegan, 35, meanwhile, is the lead singer of Screaming Trees, a
Seattle band that has been on an extended _ in fact, seemingly
endless _ hiatus after rising to prominence during the grunge
heyday in the early and mid-'90s. ``I'll Take Care of You'' is the
fourth in his series of increasingly stark solo albums.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface the two albums are as different as they could
possibly be. ``In Spite of Ourselves'' is a fun-loving collection,
in Prine's words, of ``meetin', cheatin' and retreatin''' country
songs on which he sings duets charmingly with nine of his favorite
female singers, including Emmylou Harris, Trisha Yearwood and
Connie Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll Take Care of You,'' on the other hand, is moody and
inward-looking, a highly personal survey of folk (Fred Neil's
``Badi-Da''), rhythm-and-blues (the title track, written by Brook
Benton and defined by Bobby (Blue) Bland) and gospel (the Sunset
Travelers' ``On Jesus' Program''). The 11 songs are held together
only by Lanegan's infallible ear for their underlying desperation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that obvious difference, however, the albums share
elements in common that reveal why projects like these appeal to
songwriters. Both are spare and often acoustic in their
arrangements, stripped down even by the modest standards of these
two nonsuperstars. None of the rough edges have been smoothed,
which lends the albums the feel of work done purely for enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   Prine had long wanted to do a collection of this kind and, after
a bout with cancer, he completed it with the dispatch of someone
who no longer sees any reason to hold off doing exactly what he
wants to do.
</P>
<P>
   Prine also chose songs _ like George Jones and Tammy Wynette's
``We're Not the Jet Set'' or Webb Pierce's ``Back Street Affair'' _
that are reminiscent of his own. They are tender, casually
insightful and often funny, goofy even. The one original song he
contributes _ the title track, a duet with Iris DeMent that also
appears on the soundtrack to Billy Bob Thornton's new film, ``Daddy
and Them'' _ underscores the connection.
</P>
<P>
   Country music has been part of Prine's repertory for years, and
``In Spite of Ourselves'' could easily be mistaken for a
little-known song that the singer had found and decided to record.
And George Jones needn't fear Prine's readings. Prine doesn't even
try to match the master. In his characteristically friendly,
Dylanesque bray, Prine sings with open-hearted enthusiasm of a fan,
not a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Lanegan also uses ``I'll Take Care of You'' to demonstrate links
between his own dark self-explorations and earlier musical styles.
He would be, for example, nobody's first choice to cover Bobby
Bland, a singer whose effortless command is the precise opposite of
Lanegan's limited range, jerry-built phrasing and reluctance to
seize center stage.
</P>
<P>
   But Lanegan makes a sharp interpretive tool of his limitations.
Given his pained vocal style and haunted consciousness, all the
threat, obsession and control implied in Bland's version of ``I'll
Take Care of You'' come aggressively to the fore. Similarly, in
Lanegan's hands, ``On Jesus' Program'' becomes less a prescription
for salvation than a hopeless wish from the realms of the damned.
</P>
<P>
   Like David Bowie, who first shattered the values of '60s rock
'n' roll and then acknowledged his debt to them on an album of
songs from that period (``Pin Ups,'' from 1973), Lanegan is also
engaged in an act of restoration. Seattle musicians of his
generation started out intent on shaking free of the past,
determined to speak in a new voice. Once that freedom was achieved,
it then became possible to explore and reveal meaningful
connections. Lanegan is doing that on ``I'll Take Care of You,''
recasting tradition in the light of his individual talent.
</P>
<P>
   It's often said of the best interpretive singers that they make
every song they sing their own. That's not true in either of these
instances, and, in fact, it's rarely true when songwriters sing the
songs of others. These albums are meant to deepen our understanding
of Prine and Lanegan, to reveal the sources of their inspiration
and to broaden the perspective in which we view their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Their performances are a commentary on the original songs, as
well as on their own body of work. As singers, then, they are
still, in a sense, writers continuing their complicated journeys
along the trail Dylan blazed.

CASINO CHILD-CARE CENTERS MUST BE LICENSED, MISSOURI COMMISSION
DECIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Casino child-care centers must be licensed by the
Missouri Department of Health within 70 days under an emergency
rule put in force Tuesday by the Missouri Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Private child-care contractors at two Missouri riverboats,
including Station Casino Kansas City, currently operate under
licensing exemptions that permit churches, schools and businesses
to offer what amounts to short-term baby-sitting as a convenience
to patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Only Station Casino and the Riverport complex in Maryland
Heights, operated jointly by Harrah's Entertainment Inc. and
Players International Inc., are affected by the new rule. The rule
would also apply to any new child-care facilities that open at
gambling boats.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaming Commission also agreed Tuesday to study whether
casinos should be allowed to provide child care at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are examining whether that is good public policy,'' said
Mel Fisher, the commission's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   John V. Finamore, Station's Midwest president, said he was
disappointed in the commission's sudden crackdown on child care.
</P>
<P>
   The New Horizon Kid's Quest Inc. center at Station Casino has
operated for almost three years without incident, he said. It is
also used by customers at the casino's theaters, hotel and
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's well run by a professional company with a lot of other
operations,'' Finamore said. ``Kid's Quest gives us and our guests
another option. It helps us make sure that kids are not
unattended.''
</P>
<P>
   Exempt centers remain subject to state investigations of
complaints. Margaret Franklin, chief of the state's Bureau of Child
Care Safety and Licensure, said Tuesday that no child-care
complaints had been filed against either casino with her agency.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dunkley, chief executive of Kid's Quest, which is based in
Minnesota, said Tuesday that his company's standards at 85 U.S.
facilities, including 15 other casinos, exceeded most states'
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Dunkley said, Missouri does not require
fingerprinting and criminal-background checks of child-care
workers. However, Kid's Quest workers in Kansas City undergo the
same criminal background checks that the casino conducts on its
potential employees.
</P>
<P>
   Dunkley also said Missouri's staff requirements were equal to or
greater than Kid's Quest. Missouri, for instance, requires one
staff member for every eight children in the post-toddler to
2-year-old range. Kid's Quest operates under a 1-to-7 ratio, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri also does not require workers to be trained in first
aid or CPR techniques, Dunkley said, while Kid's Quest workers are
required to have such training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not have any problem with that (new casino licensing
rule),'' Dunkley said. ``It's a standard that's really well below
the standards we have already set.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin said tougher criminal screening standards in Missouri
would go into effect Jan. 1. She also said first-aid topics could
be part of the 12 hours of in-service training classes that
licensed child-care workers must take each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problem if someone's standards are tougher than
ours,'' she said. ``That's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Children's Choice Learning Centers Inc., based in Dallas,
operates a second child-care facility at Station for casino
employees only. That operation is licensed and inspected by the
state, Finamore said.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Choice officials are seeking state approval to offer
day care for mildly ill children that would be available to the
general public.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the Gaming Commission:
</P>
<P>
   - Did not consider Station Casinos' proposed purchase of the
Flamingo Hilton Casino in Kansas City. Station officials had hoped
to win state agency approval in November and close the $22.5
million deal by today. Fisher said the commission's formal
investigation of the sale was not yet completed.
</P>
<P>
   - Recommended a $1,500 fine against the Southside Kansas City
Optimist Club in Grandview for allowing snack bar owner Doyle
Sullivan to also work at the club's weekly bingo games. Sullivan
has not been a member of the organization for the minimum two years
required by state law. Southside has 30 days to appeal the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   - Approved a corporate reorganization of Harrah's North Kansas
City Casino &AMP; Hotel from a corporate subsidiary of Harrah's
Entertainment Inc. to a limited liability company.
</P>
<P>
   - Allowed Station Casino Kansas City to fill its off-river
mooring basin with treated city tap water instead of water pumped
directly from the Missouri River. ``The big concern is the public
health risk of putting stinky river water within 10 feet of where
people are walking around,'' said Kevin Mullally, deputy director
of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   - Disclosed that Davis Gaming is considering selling some or all
of its interest in a proposed riverboat casino in Boonville, Mo.,
to an unidentified potential partner. The casino was tentatively
approved by the commission in 1997, but the project has stalled
over several issues and construction has been suspended.

NASA CONTROLLERS NUDGE MARS ORBITER CLOSER TO LANDING SITE 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Flight controllers fine-tuned the trajectory
of NASA's Mars Polar Orbiter on Tuesday, nudging the small probe
closer to its intended landing site at the barren planet's south
pole.
</P>
<P>
   The small spacecraft is scheduled to touch down at 3:01 p.m. EST
Friday following a 5 1/2-minute, high-velocity plunge into the thin
Martian atmosphere and an 11-month journey from Earth. The probe
was designed to slow to a landing on the northern fringes of the
planet's south pole, slowed by a single parachute and the pulsing
of small braking thrusters.
</P>
<P>
   If the probe reaches the surface safely, scientists plan to use
a 6.5-foot long robot arm on the spacecraft and other instruments
to dig for evidence of frozen water in the subsoil. Scientists
believe the south pole may contain a reservoir of frozen water,
which once flowed over the now arid surface before Mars underwent a
change in climate.
</P>
<P>
   As the spacecraft sped within 780,000 miles of the Red Planet on
Tuesday, ground control teams at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
altered the spacecraft's 12,000 mph velocity by 1 mph, with a
12.6-second long maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly small change in velocity could make a big
difference as the Polar Lander reaches Mars on Friday. If it
arrives with an overly steep trajectory, the spacecraft could
descend too quickly and crash.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fifth such maneuver since the Polar Lander was
launched Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Though evaluations of the maneuver's accuracy will continue
until Friday, mission managers were confident that the Mars Polar
Lander is on course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current estimate of the flight path shows us right on
target,'' said NASA's Sam Thurman, the Mars Polar Lander flight
operations manager.
</P>
<P>
   Navigation and operations teams have been working around the
clock since the Thanksgiving holiday to ensure their calculations
are correct.
</P>
<P>
   A companion spacecraft, NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter, was lost
Sept. 23, just as it was maneuvering into orbit around the planet
following a near 10-month transit from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The mishap was blamed on navigational errors later attributed to
a mixup between NASA and its contractor, Lockheed Martin, over the
use of metric and English unit of force for navigational maneuvers.
Though the space agency found no similar mixup with the Polar
Lander probe, it has added experts and checked and rechecked its
calculations of the spacecraft's trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   The task of landing on Mars is even more daunting.
</P>
<P>
   In order to land on the site selected by scientists in August,
the Polar Lander must hit an imaginary elliptical ``bulls eye''
about 80 miles above the Martian atmosphere. About 25 miles long
and 6.2 miles wide, the bulls eye represents the opening for an
imaginary corridor that will whisk the probe through the atmosphere
to the Martian surface.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's maneuver nudged the probe closer to the center of the
bulls eye. With the intense tracking and constant re-evaluations
under way, flight controllers will have an opportunity for a final
maneuver Friday, 6 1/2 hours before the landing, if they find
dispersions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to emphasize this is a very complex task we're going to
undertake,'' NASA's John McNamee, the Mars Polar Lander project
development manager, said. ``Landing on the surface of another
planet is a very difficult thing to do.''

JUDGE GIVES PRELIMINARY OK TO SETTLEMENT INVOLVING WATER HEATER
PART REPAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A federal judge has given preliminary
approval to a settlement that makes more than 14 million water
heaters eligible for repairs because of a defective piece of
plastic pipe called a dip tube.
</P>
<P>
   The order by Judge Howard F. Sachs of the U.S. District Court in
Kansas City will remain preliminary until a hearing in April. But
it allows consumers to immediately begin filing claims and in some
cases immediately receive repairs in what is expected to be the
most expensive effort ever by the water heater industry to fix a
product defect.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs, in the order, said the settlement had the appearance of
``being fair, adequate and reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Hilburg, a spokesman for the water heater manufacturers,
said publicity of the settlement would start next week, including
notices to be published in more than 800 newspapers, a consumer
education video to television stations and letters to all consumers
who can be identified as owning one of the defective water heaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to meet the needs of the consumers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement aims to settle about two dozen class-action
lawsuits from across the country that have been filed since the
first of the year on behalf of consumers who have one of the
defective dip tubes.
</P>
<P>
   The dip tube is a piece of plastic pipe, which costs a
manufacturer less than $1, that funnels cold water to the bottom of
the tank so it can be heated. Perfection Corp., the company that
makes most of the dip tubes for the water heater manufacturers, has
previously said that from August 1993 to October 1996 it made the
tubes without a key chemical ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that many of the tubes started to disintegrate,
causing the water heater to produce less hot water. In addition,
plastic chips from the defective tubes clogged pipes, faucets and
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement offers to replace all 14 million defective dip
tubes, even those that have not begun to dissolve. Previously, the
manufacturers refused to replace those that were not breaking
apart.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary order allows Crawford &AMP; Co., the company hired
to administer the settlement, to accept claims to make the repairs.
A toll-free telephone number, (800) 329-0561, and a Web site,
www.diptubesettlement.com, are now in operation.
</P>
<P>
   Water heaters with dip tubes that have already begun to dissolve
will be able to get immediate help and won't have to wait for the
settlement to become final. Others will have to wait until after
the April hearing, although claims can be filed now.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have already paid for dip tube repairs will be
reimbursed at least up to $175. Those who haven't had the tube
replaced will receive a certificate that will be given to the
plumber making the repair.
</P>
<P>
   Additional expenses or work, such as replacing a faucet clogged
with plastic chips, will have to be approved by a panel of plumbers
that is part of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers seeking reimbursement will have until June to file a
claim. Those still needing the necessary repairs will have until
next December.
</P>
<P>
   Plumbers were recently notified of the settlement and were asked
to help in replacing the dip tubes and making other repairs. They
will be paid $185 for replacing a dip tube and flushing out the
plastic chips, and a lesser amount for replacement of a dip tube
that has not started to disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   Ken McClain, attorney for Humphrey Farrington &AMP; McClain in
Independence, which was the first law firm to file a dip tube
class-action lawsuit, said the judge's approval, though
preliminary, was important, especially in allowing the settlement
to be publicized.
</P>
<P>
   Jim O'Reilly, visiting professor of law at the University of
Cincinnati and the author of several books on class action, said
the problem with the dip tubes was ideal for a class-action lawsuit
because individual lawsuits were uneconomical.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the dip tube settlement actually offers to fix the
problem. Many class-action settlements have been criticized for
doing more to benefit the company charged with causing the problem.
For example, a cruise line settled one class-action suit by
offering coupons for $15 off a future cruise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly better than the coupon settlements,'' Ray
Warner, a professor of law at the University of Missouri-Kansas
City, said of the dip tube settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are still suspicions among some consumers
that the water heater industry, which seemed to downplay the
problem with the dip tubes and never ordered a recall, won't do
everything it can to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Kimberline of Liberty was able to get her water heater's
dip tube replaced last month, but the manufacturer offered little
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is, you have to keep at them,'' she said.

 &HT;    Alabama defense confident despite injuries
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ When Paul ``Bear'' Bryant was coaching
Alabama football, the Crimson Tide won national titles for one
reason _ defense.
</P>
<P>
   But things have changed since Bryant left town. So has good
defensive football.
</P>
<P>
   When Alabama beat Florida on Oct. 2, the Crimson Tide defense
was ranked 41st in the country.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, when the Tide plays the Gators in the SEC
Championship Game, the defense will be different _ and better.
Alabama has moved from 41st to 22nd.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 starters who began the season on defense, five remain,
mostly because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Tide probably had enough good athletes to survive the loss
of one, two or even three players during the season. But on Nov. 6
against LSU, Alabama lost three at once. Middle linebacker Marvin
Constant, defensive tackle Kenny Smith and defensive end Canary
Knight suffered season-ending injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Defying all odds, Alabama's defense has continued to improve,
and the coaches say they can't explain why. Reggie Myles' move from
cornerback to safety has had a lot to do with it, along with the
maturation of defensive lineman Kenny King, linebacker Saleem
Rasheed and cornerback Gerald Dixon _ all starting as freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is a game of repetition,'' defensive coordinator
Ellis Johnson said. ``Early on, they were thinking; now, they're
reacting. Those people not in the coaching business won't
understand this, but you've got to have patience with very young
players. There are no magic pills, no magic calls, no magic
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know sometimes in the past,'' Johnson said, ``when we might
be short of talent or would have injuries at certain positions, we
would try to X and O it and cover it up, but it just confused the
players.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I teach defense with sight, reaction and contact,'' said
defensive line coach Lance Thompson, who has seen one-half of his
line disappear because of injuries. ``As we've gotten better, we've
gotten more aggressive. You're going to see us be more aggressive
against Florida than we were when we played them in October. But
now, we can afford to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In its past six games, Alabama's opponents have rushed 145 times
for 189 yards, an average of 1.3 yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he respects Florida's Steve Spurrier as one of the
most innovative offensive minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a good system, and he does a good job of jumping on a
weakness he sees on film,'' Johnson said. ``The speed they have
puts so much pressure on your defense. Our secondary has really
improved, and I think we can afford to be more aggressive because
of it. As they've improved, I've grown to have more trust in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with all the things they do, you may find yourself doing
too much, preparing for so many things that the kids are confused
and aren't playing fast,'' he said. ``We're not going to get too
flowery in preparing.''
</P>
<P>
   When the season started, Thompson said, he was rotating 10
defensive linemen. Now he's down to six or seven. ``We just try to
keep them fresh. You couldn't ask for anything more.''

 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``DESERT'' &QL; 
Photos by Jack Dykinga, text by Janice Emily Bowers (Abrams,
$49.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This book offers lots of pretty photographs of the Mojave Desert
in which Dykinga seems to concede (appearances on the cover
notwithstanding) that not everything in the rural Southwest is
fluorescent orange. The big draw for us, however, is Janice Emily
Bowers, who lives near Tucson and who has written lovely essays
(``A Full Life in a Small Place'') about the natural wonders there.
Both writer and photographer were assisted by the rains &QL; 
of El Nino during the winter of 1997-1998, which brought the desert
into abundant bloom and made their jobs even more pleasurable than
they'd expected them to be. Tourists came from far away to see the
flowers that spring, many for the first time. Bowers envied them.
``The first time of seeing the desert in bloom is almost painful in
its intensity,'' she writes, ``as if every flower were a needle
piercing your skin or a chunk of ice pressed onto your flesh. I
wanted to join that spring, as if it were a circus, and travel with
it forever.'' She acknowledges that this book might attract more
tourists, which increases her concern over the beautiful,
vulnerable desert. Are the crowds good or bad? ``Sometimes,'' she
writes, ``I don't know which group worries me most: the millions
who visit or the millions who stay away.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``ATLANTIS FOUND'' &QL; 
By Clive Cussler (Putnam, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is what Clive Cussler says about his appeal as a writer:
``I give people what they want. My books are like an old Saturday
afternoon matinee with easily identifiable characters: the big
rugged hero; the shrewd heroine (who is never a bimbo); the nasty
villain who gets it in the end . . . I never mean for it to be
anything more than entertainment.'' His sprawling novel features
his recurring big rugged hero, Dirk Pitt, who is supremely capable
and ever manly but a bit on the stiff side (he's like James Bond
without the panache). His shrewd heroine who isn't a bimbo is Pat
O'Connell, an expert in ancient languages. And the villains? There
are so many, and they fall all over themselves trying to kill
O'Connell and her colleagues and then Pitt, who makes a Bond-like
entrance and rescues them from drowning in flooded tunnels under a
mountain in Colorado. One of the assassins shows up in a ninja suit
and a ski mask, and even though he has a chest wound and is
bleeding from the mouth, he calmly discusses his motives with Pitt
before swallowing a cyanide capsule _ a Saturday matinee touch if
we've ever seen one. The plot here is impossible to describe
because it's more a collection of parts than a cohesive whole.
Among the elements: a comet that crashed into the Earth 9,000 years
ago; a frozen ghost ship discovered near the South Pole in 1858; an
underground chamber with inscriptions on its walls and a black
skull on a pedestal; a Nazi U-boat that attacks Pitt's research
vessel; and a cameo appearance by Cussler himself (a Hitchcockian
tradition that he has added to his novels). We'll let you guess who
triumphs before the final credits roll.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WITH WILDER'' &QL; 
By Cameron Crowe (Knopf, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is a wonderful book, not just for film buffs but for those
of us who believe in preserving the stories of people who have had
long and eventful lives. That's an understated description of
director Billy Wilder, of course, but it's the spirit in which this
volume was written. In 1995, Crowe, who had adapted his book ``Fast
Times at Ridgemont High'' for film and had written and directed
``Say Anything,'' approached Wilder and asked the 89-year-old
director to play a bit part in his next movie, ``Jerry Maguire.''
Wilder said no, even when Crowe came back with Tom Cruise, who
turned on the high beams and begged. Crowe wrote about Wilder's
rebuff for ``Rolling Stone.'' Wilder read and liked the story, and
he agreed to an interview with Crowe, a project that expanded to
become this book. In question-and-answer format, Wilder talks about
working with actors (Jack Lemmon, Gary Cooper, Audrey Hepburn,
Marilyn Monroe, Cary Grant, Barbara Stanwyck, Greta Garbo), his
films (``Some Like It Hot,'' ``The Apartment,'' ``Ace in the
Hole,'' ``Sunset Boulevard''), other directors and his big
inspiration, Ernst Lubitsch. There are anecdotes on every page, and
no pretense in sight. The interviews, conducted by Crowe with the
persistence of a journalist and the giddy curiosity of a fan, took
place over more than a year, ending in 1998, when Wilder was 91. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``A PASSION FOR BOOKS'' &QL; 
Edited by Harold Rabinowitz and Rob Kaplan (Times, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an essay written in 1981, Anatole Broyard laments the fact
that his friends borrow his books because he has more than most
people, never mind that ``I feel about lending a book the way most
fathers feel about their daughters living with a man out of
wedlock.'' Robertson Davies writes about the idiosyncrasies of book
collecting. Anna Quindlen offers a list of ``The Ten Books One
Would Save in a Fire, If One Could Save Only Ten.'' John Updike
bemoans the gray fluff of book envelopes. Robert Benchley wonders
why no one collects his books (this was in 1934 _ things have
changed). Norman Mailer names his favorite American novels: not one
of them was written by him. This collection is for people who know
what Peter Hamill was talking about when he said this: ``There are
10,000 books in my library, and it will keep growing until I die.
This has exasperated my daughters, amused my friends, and baffled
my accountant. If I had not picked up this habit in the library
long ago, I would have more money in the bank today. I would not be
richer.'' &QL;

 &HT;    As O'Leary sees it, `Better team won'
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ George O'Leary was so steamed Tuesday that one would
have thought his Georgia Tech team had lost to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets coach was perturbed that a controversial
fumble call in the game against Georgia is getting more media play
than Tech's 51-48 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game wasn't stolen. ... Basically ... the better team won
_ period,'' O'Leary said. ``You win or lose a game with class, and,
obviously, a lot of people can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said he has no problem with the way Georgia coach Jim
Donnan has handled the controversy. Donnan has not dwelled on the
issue publicly.
</P>
<P>
   The Tech coach just wishes others would get over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rehashing (the fumble) is a little bit of overkill,'' O'Leary
said. ``Every game, there are calls that are made, or not made,
that have an impact. When it was all said and done, the score was
48-48, we started even in overtime _ and they lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '97, when a (questionable) interference call cost us the
Georgia game, you didn't see that replayed every day or pictures of
the play splashed across the front of the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech tight end Conrad Andrzejewski also recalls the 1997 game.
After reading a column by the Journal-Consti- tution's Mark Bradley
about the fumble call _ which was published Tuesday with a series
of photos that appeared to show Sanks was down _ he fired off an
e-mail to Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought back to two years ago when Georgia won in the last
seconds of the game,'' he wrote. ``We pick off one pass that would
(have) ended the game but pass interference was called on our
(defensive back). If you watch the tape, it was the worst call I
have seen. But you don't see us (complaining) about the loss. We
lost that game just as Georgia lost this one.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary claims that the game had several critical calls, or
non-calls, that did not go the Jackets' way. He said he has a tape
with eight such incidents, including a late interception by Georgia
on which Tech's Jon Muyres was held. The Bulldogs scored after that
pickoff by Cap Burnett to take a 48-41 lead.

BRADLEY CONTINUES ASSAULT ON GORE HEALTH CARE PROPOSALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Going on the offensive against Vice President
Gore for a second straight day, Democratic presidential contender
Bill Bradley Tuesday sharply criticized Gore's health &UR;  &LR; care
proposals, saying Gore is content to ``take a broken system and
throw money at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to about 160 people who packed an auditorium at the
University of New Hampshire, Bradley charged that Gore has spoken
grandly of his ambitions for health care reform but is proposing
only small, symbolic improvements in the system. The vice
president's narrow-gauge approach epitomizes why so many voters
have lost faith in political leaders, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big rhetoric followed by small actions contributes to people's
cyncicism about politics,'' Bradley said. ``We live in a time of
unparalleled prosperity. We should fix our roof when the sun is
shining. We should do something big'' to provide health care for
millions who lack it.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, also campaigning in New Hampshire, shot back
with its view that Bradley's health care plan is irresponsibly
spendthrift and would theaten the economy. Gore press secretary
Chris Lehane charged that Bradley was going over to the attack
because he ``is increasingly becoming a desperate polician.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming a day after Bradley ripped into Clinton-Gore foreign
policy in Russia and the Balkans, Tuesday's back-and-forth
represented a further sharpening and deepening of differences
between the two Democratic contenders, a phenomenon many campaign
workers say is happening much earlier than they expected. New
Hampshire's first-in-the-nation presidential primary is Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley was attacking Gore on health care in Manchester,
the vice president was in Bedford, telling a group of about 200
business people that he knows how to keep the economy going strong.
Over a bacon and eggs breakfast, Gore said the policy proposals of
Bradley and all the Republican candidates for president would harm
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will pledge to you, if you elect me president, I will
balance the budget and better every single year,'' Gore said,
vowing also to reduce the national debt during each year of a Gore
presidency in order to keep interest rates low.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore frequently reminds voters about economic growth in
New England during the Clinton administration, it is usually an
aside, rather than his main focus. This time, aligning himself with
the president, Gore took credit for the nation's economic
turnaround, saying the administration has gotten the fundamentals
right, while his opponents have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single one of the Republican candidates for president
has endorsed a truly reckless tax scheme that would immediately put
our country right back into deficits,'' Gore said. ``Senator
Bradley, by contrast, in his very first campaign proposal proposes
a health care scheme that would give two-thirds of the money to
people who already have insurance, many of them wealthy, and spend
the entire budget surplus for the next ten years, also putting us
immediately right back into deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley made his remarks before a crowd of about 300 students
and faculty who received him warmly at Keene State College. The
candidate delivered the best performance of his two-day New England
swing, frequently getting laughs and applause for folksy jokes and
family stories.

 &HT;    Concussions discussions hot topic for NHL

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nelson Emerson has seen the replay several times now.
</P>
<P>
   The drop pass he made in the neutral zone. The prolonged look he
made over his right shoulder to follow the trail of the pass _ big
mistake. The seeming brick wall he ran into, knocking him backward
and his head bouncing off the ice. Then the real scary part _ the
blackout, the leg twitching, the convulsing, the arms flailing.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson sees the tape. But he doesn't remember any of it
happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first period,'' the Thrashers' right wing said
Tuesday. ``I remember going out to start the second period on the
power play. The next thing I remember is being in the emergency
room.''
</P>
<P>
   It's conceivable that without the aid of videotape Emerson never
will be able to recall the details of a mid-ice check by Florida's
Jaroslav Spacek on Saturday that left him with a Grade 2
concussion.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the tape was provided by his wife, June, who was
home in Atlanta watching the game on television. She understandably
was panic-stricken while her husband was having his head
immobilized and was being strapped to a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   It's with some relief that Emerson is experiencing only memory
loss and nausea today and that he will be out of action two to four
weeks. At the time, it looked worse. Scott Green, the team trainer,
said it was the worst reaction to a concussion he had seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor timed it and said Nelson was unconscious for a
minute,'' Green said. ``It sure seemed longer than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was conscious, he was combative. That's when the
gloves came off his hands. He didn't really know what was going on.
That was the trauma to the brain. He was struggling to breathe, so
I was trying to hold his jaw to keep his mouth open.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL's youngest organization is becoming too familiar with
concussions. It already has suffered six _ four on the Thrashers
(Emerson, Patrik Stefan, Petr Buzek and Vladimir Vujtek) and two in
the minor-league system (Jason Botterill, Sean Ritchlin).
</P>
<P>
   On the same night that Stefan _ already trying to shake his
dizzying past _ suffered one against Buffalo Nov. 19, Botterill was
KO'd in his first game after being sent to Orlando (IHL) for
conditioning, and Ritchlin suffered the same fate with Greenville
(ECHL). All have come in different circumstances and varying
degrees of severity
</P>
<P>
   ``That's scary,'' said Buzek, hit from behind into the glass in
Montreal. ``I don't know what's going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson takes partial blame for his injury. ``I made a mistake
looking back at my pass. I felt I had all the avenues covered. I
felt I knew where all of their players were. Obviously, the one
player who hit me, I was unaware where he was coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacek was given a major penalty for charging and a game
misconduct, meaning that he was thrown out for the rest of the
contest. The league has reviewed the play and will not suspend him.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson, when asked about the hit, said, ``I felt he hit me very
late when I was in a vulnerable position. I felt he deserved to be
thrown out of the game because of the effects of what happened to
me. But I don't feel like the kid purposely tried to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers have more than the average, but concussions are a
league-wide concern. Since 1997-98, all training staffs have
documented all concussions _ the type of hit, whether the player
wears a mouthpiece and other information. The league's most recent
injury report, issued before Emerson's injury Saturday, showed
eight players now who have returned or are just coming back from
concussions.
</P>
<P>
   There were 92 concussions reported in 1997-98 and 105 last
season. At least six players have retired recently because of head
injuries, including Geoff Courtnall, Pat Lafontaine and Jeff
Beukeboom.
</P>
<P>
   A second referee was added in part to crack down on shots to the
head behind the play. More players are being suspended. Some
improvements are being made in helmets; for example, Stefan will be
fitted for one with additional padding. Mouthguards appear to
absorb some shock that contributes to concussions, but they aren't
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the league ordered all NHL arenas using
``seamless'' glass to be fitted with a system of boards that gives
more upon impact.
</P>
<P>
   But generally, concussions can't be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of it is the acceleration-type injuries, where a guy
is going full-bore and then gets stopped suddenly,'' Green said.
``When that happens, the brain is still traveling at the speed they
were going, and it hits the front of the head. It sloshes, like
Jell-O. There's no helmet that can stop that.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson, generously listed at 5 feet 11, 180 pounds, depends
more on speed than physical play. He understands that his rushes
through the neutral zone come with risk. ``My injury _ that's
something that happens,'' he said. ``It's an open-ice hit. It's
probably the beauty of the game that a player can step up and catch
him with his head down.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's something he doesn't want to experience again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never a good thing to see something like that,'' he said.
``And when it happens to you, it's scary.''

   BC-INSIDER-MOVIE-NYT (moved on Tuesday, Nov. 23)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Tuesday, Nov. 23,
pondered the relative professional dependability of lawyers and
journalists, as reflected in the movie ``The Insider.'' The film is
a dramatic adaptation of events four years ago, when CBS,
perceiving a threat of a devastating lawsuit, eviscerated a ``60
Minutes'' broadcast of an interview by a tobacco industry
whistle-blower.
</P>
<P>
   The Times article wove its thesis mainly out of the movie
version of the plot; the article signaled that device by giving the
participants double-barreled names (Hewitt-Hall, for example,
meaning the executive producer Don Hewitt of CBS, as played by
Philip Baker Hall, and Wallace-Plummer for the reporter Mike
Wallace as played by Christopher Plummer).
</P>
<P>
   At some points, though, the article spoke of ``Mr. Hewitt'' and
``Mr. Wallace,'' referring to the actual people. Those references
undercut the distinction between the actions of the two journalists
and their fictional representations. It should have been
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS staff memo, reported in The Times on Nov. 3, emphasized
the liberties taken by the movie _ noting, for example, that the
actual Mr. Wallace spoke out publicly against CBS's corporate
decision after only a day and not, as depicted on screen, after
days or weeks of persuasion by his producer, Lowell Bergman.

 &HT;    Upset causes spike in UD ticket demand
 &HT;    By Bucky Albers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ University of Dayton basketball tickets became a
hot item Tuesday on the heels of Monday night's 68-66 upset of the
13th-ranked Kentucky Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   The telephones in the UD Arena ticket office rang constantly
Tuesday morning. It was mid-afternoon before things slowed down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the Kentucky victory) had a tremendous impact,'' said
ticket manager Joe Granito, who estimated that his office had 10
times as much activity as it would on a normal day. Granito
couldn't think of anything comparable in the 10 years he's been on
the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ticket purchasers were interested in the holiday
games with Texas A&AMP;M (Dec. 21), St. Louis (Dec. 23) and Miami (Dec.
29).
</P>
<P>
   Granito said some of the callers said they think the Flyers, who
are now 4-0, might be good enough to get into the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of 400 level tickets ($7 adults, $4 for those
under 16) available for all games, including tonight's game with
Maryland-Baltimore County and Saturday's game with Winthrop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have the Atlantic 10 package _ eight games for $50,''
Granito said. ``We sold quite a few of those today. They're right
behind our season ticket holders. If you bought them individually,
it would cost $64. Basically, they're getting two games for
nothing.

TEXAS POLITICIANS TOUT INTERNATIONAL TRADE REPORT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ While protesters disrupted opening ceremonies of the
World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle on Tuesday, two Texas
politicians praised international trade and released a report
revealing the benefits to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Texas exports totaled $78 billion in 1998, according to a study
conducted for The Business Roundtable, a national association of
chief executives officers of leading corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas last year put $3,600 on the world market for every man,
woman and child in the state,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
``This report is important because it proves that trade works.''
</P>
<P>
   Release of the information apparently was timed to coincide with
the WTO meeting in Seattle, where discussions were to begin on new
rules governing international trade. Thousands of demonstrators
seeking to impose more worker and environmental protections blocked
the streets and forced the delay of opening ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are they afraid of?'' Gramm asked at a press conference
in Dallas as police in Seattle were firing pepper spray at the
protesters. ``They're afraid of freedom. They're afraid of
competition. We believe Texans can out-produce any workers in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said that ``enlightenment'' about free trade has made the
United States ``the greatest trading nation in the world'' and that
``we have the highest living standard of any people who ever lived
on the face of this planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Conducted by Global Trade Information Services of Columbia,
S.C., the latest trade study found that Texas exports increased by
3.5 percent from 1997 to 1998, a period when U.S. exports overall
declined by 1.1 percent and Texas trailed only California in world
exports.
</P>
<P>
   Most, if not all, of the growth came in trading with America's
partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement, which went
into effect nearly six years ago. From 1996 to 1998, Texas' trade
with Canada and Mexico increased from about $31 billion to about
$42 billion. During that same period, trade with Asia declined
slightly, trade with Europe grew slightly and trade with the Middle
East, South America and Central America remained essentially flat.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, where $33 billion worth of Texas products was sold in
1998, was by far the state's largest trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the report noted, Texas' exports of gas turbines
increased by 17.5 percent in 1998, up to $770 million. But, the
most striking growth was with Mexico, where gas turbine sales
jumped from $48 million to $144.5 million _ an increase of 200
percent _ in one year.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicles and parts accounted for nearly 7 percent of all exports
from Texas, the study found, and exports to Mexico grew by 64
percent in 1998, from $1.8 billion to more than $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the study also found that more Texas
businesses are pursuing international markets and that is causing a
manufacturing, trucking and warehousing boom along the Texas-Mexico
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of businesses in this area has increased by 37.2
percent (from 1993 to 1996),'' the report stated. ``This is
impressive when compared to 20.5 percent for the rest of the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Employment in border counties during the same period increased
by about 31 percent, compared to nearly 12 percent for the rest of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the House majority leader,
appeared with Gramm at the Dallas press conference. He also used
the occasion to advocate free trade and criticize those disrupting
the WTO meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we close our doors to trade,'' Armey said, ``we'll be
putting the jobs of thousands of Texans on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Exporting manufacturers in Texas employ about $614,000 workers.
Of those jobs, 117,000 are directly linked to exporting, the
Roundtable report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade is not easy to understand,'' said Armey, who, like
Gramm, is a former professor of economics. ``It is important for
those of us who do understand it to stand up and fight for it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armey's 26th Congressional District exported about $3.5 billion
in farm and manufactured goods in 1998. His district was one of
five in the state profiled by the study.
</P>
<P>
   Another was the 22nd District represented by Rep. Tom DeLay,
R-Texas. In 1998, manufacturers, wholesalers and farmers there
exported $4.8 billion worth of products.

MRS CLINTON ATTACKS GIULIANI'S POLICY OF ARRESTING HOMELESS PEOPLE
</HEADLINE>
 (sw) 
By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Offering the most pointed attack to date on her
likely Senate opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday condemned
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's policy of arresting homeless people in New
York City for sleeping on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our political leaders must be judged on how they treat
everyone, including the least fortunate,'' Mrs. Clinton told an
audience made up of mostly black ministers. ``We must ask
ourselves: do we solve problems or simply push them away,
politicize them and criminalize them?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be absolutely clear,'' she continued. ``Breaking up
families that are homeless is wrong. Criminalizing the homeless
with mass arrests for those whose only offense is that they have no
home is wrong. Locking people up for a day will not take a single
homeless person off the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton did not mention the Republican mayor by name during
her remarks at the New York Theological Seminary in Manhattan. But
she clearly sought to portray Giuliani as favoring policies that
were less than humane to homeless and poor New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton also clearly intended to sound like the candidate
she promised to be just last week, when she declared, under
pressure from fellow Democrats, that she fully intended to run for
the Senate although she declined even then to get drawn into a
debate over the mayor's homeless policy.
</P>
<P>
   Her advisers suggested that Tuesday's appearance, marked by her
strong condemnation and her deliberate attack on one of the mayor's
latest programs, signaled a decision to move into an active
campaign mode by staking out positions highlighting her differences
with Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, her aides said, Mrs. Clinton had determined through
polling and surveys by news organizations that Giuliani's position
on arresting homeless people for sleeping on the streets was widely
unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, traveling from fund-raiser to fund-raiser in Texas on
Tuesday, was quick to defend his strategy. Noting that the city had
a complex set of responses to the issue of homelessness and that
just a small percentage of the homeless have been arrested,
Giuliani said that take ``some of the few situations in which
someone's arrested and to try to make that into the whole program,
could portray a misunderstanding of how the program works.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton made her remarks at an hour-long meeting where she
was warmly received and interrupted several times by applause. The
audience included many of the most prominent black ministers in New
York City, including two friends of the president and Mrs. Clinton:
the Rev. Gardner C. Taylor, the pastor emeritus of the Concord
Baptist Church in Brooklyn, and the Rev. James Forbes, the pastor
of Riverside Church in Manhattan. Mrs. Clinton was also seated at a
table in the front of the room with former Mayor David Dinkins and
Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Clinton covered a number of topics, the issue of
homelessness was the cornerstone of her speech at Tuesday's
breakfast. Noting that 250,000 households in New York are on an
eight-year-long waiting list for federally subsidized housing, she
called for more federal funds for low-income housing and pledged
that, if elected, she would work to secure more money for housing
and for programs that treat mentally ill people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am elected senator, I will fight hard to triple new
housing vouchers and target them to areas with the highest need,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Joseph Llota complained later in the day that Mrs.
Clinton wanted to ``turn back the clock'' on homeless policy.
``Unfortunately, Hillary just doesn't get it,'' Llota said. ``New
York City spends more money on the homeless than any other
community in America. Our strategy is to get as many people as
possible off the streets to get the services that we pay for.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After her appearance at the morning breakfast on Fifth Avenue in
Manhattan, Mrs. Clinton flew to Buffalo, where she spent several
hours greeting customers in a pizza restaurant on a busy commercial
strip.
</P>
<P>
   There she took pictures with patrons and signed autographs
before doing interview with several television and radio stations
in western New York. Then, in the evening, she flew to the town of
Great Neck on Long Island to attend a fund-raising reception for
Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y.

DEMONSTRATIONS IMPEDE PROGRESS AT TRADE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TRADE-TALKS) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER and JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Four members of President Clinton's Cabinet and
hundreds of other American officials came to Seattle this week to
push America's agenda on free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they spent Tuesday trying to negotiate their own free
passage.
</P>
<P>
   As demonstrators and tear gas mingled on the streets below, U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky was unable to leave her
hotel to start the four-day-long, 135-nation talks, which were
supposed to begin in an aging downtown theater. The Secret Service
would not let her into the streets. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and the secretary-general of the United Nations, Kofi
Annan, did not fare any better.
</P>
<P>
   And by midafternoon the ``millennium round'' of trade
negotiations that was supposed to start here this week was reduced
to a series of frantic telephone calls between hotels, as
Europeans, Asians, Africans and Americans who cannot see eye-to-eye
on trade could not even meet face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the midlevel American officials involved in the
negotiations ended up in the lobby of the Westin Hotel here sipping
lattes and waiting for security officials to signal that it was
clear for them to venture outdoors. But even then, there was no
assurance that they could get to various meeting sites, as hotels
were wringed by protesters.
</P>
<P>
   It was an embarrassing beginning to a set of negotiations that
the administration had once been reluctant to hold. Then, in a move
many American officials clearly regretted Tuesday, the White House
reversed position and Clinton volunteered to host the session here,
in hopes that launching the negotiations on home turf would give
Washington more sway over the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the focus has been on the streets instead of on the
talks. And it wasn't only downtown Seattle that was suffering from
gridlock. So were the negotiations. Europe and the United States
dug in their heels on one of the most contentious issues, an end to
Europe's huge subsidies for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, there was no real progress on one of the big
questions that the protesters were shouting about: getting the
World Trade Organization to regulate working conditions in
factories around the world. India has so far blocked any real
discussion of the issue, and American officials were scrambling,
cell phones permanently attached to their ears, to drum up some
allies in their struggle to get a ``working group'' within the WTO
that, for the first time in the history of trade talks, would make
labor conditions an explicit subject of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, all sides were trying to use the protests for
political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The French were delighted to see protesters echoe their longtime
complaint that free trade in agriculture hurts local farmers and
forces them to market foods of suspicious origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening outside is having an effect on the
negotiations,'' the European Union trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy,
said Tuesday. The American desire to eliminate government subsidies
in Europe that make it extraordinarily difficult for American
farmers to export their goods ``is even less possible'' given the
tenor of the protests, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The American delegation, milling in the lobby and conference
rooms of the Westin Hotel here, insisted that the protests
underscored the importance of moving labor rights to the top of the
WTO's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clear expression of concern by ordinary workers has to be
taken into consideration,'' said Sue Esserman, one of Ms.
Barshefsky's top deputies, who recently traveled to India in an
attempt to persuade its leaders that a discussion of labor rights
would ultimately be in their national interests. ``And that's
exactly what we have done,'' she said. Ms. Barshefsky herself
wasn't talking; her aides said she was glued to her telephone,
conferring with her foreign counterparts across town.
</P>
<P>
   American officials went to some lengths to argue Tuesday that
their work had not really been disrupted. The real give and take
goes on in back rooms and over the phone anyway, they noted, as
countries try to protect their most powerful constituencies and
search for trade-offs. ``We are using all the time available,'' Ms.
Esserman said, though she acknowledged that ``the lines are
jammed'' because hotel switchboards were overloaded.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Barshefsky was working the phones, the ministerial
meeting of the WTO began without her and without the Europeans.
Mike Moore, the former boxer and prime minister of New Zealand who
is now director general of the WTO, announced Tuesday afternoon
that ``this has not stopped our work. We are already meeting and
discussing our negotiations.'' But without two of the world's
biggest economic powerhouses in attendance, it was a bit like
beginning an opera with the soprano and the tenor stuck in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the thousands of trade officials here saw the
activity in the streets as the cacophony of democracy, a few
suspected that there was a deeper conspiracy at work. One
ambassador of a developing nation, who insisted on anonymity, said
he was certain that the Clinton administration had orchestrated the
protests in hopes of shortening the time for real negotiation.
That, in turn, would put pressure on smaller nations to give in, he
said.

   SEATTLE _ A new round of global trade talks was thrown into
turmoil Tuesday as thousands of demonstrators poured into downtown
Seattle and forced the postponement of opening ceremonies for an
event that President Clinton, who is scheduled to arrive on the
scene early Wednesday, had hoped would showcase American leadership
on free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day the protesters surrounded the convention hall,
pinned trade dignitaries in their hotels and stopped traffic on
several intersections. By late afternoon, there was a barrage of
tear gas canisters fired as Mayor Paul Schell declared a state of
emergency in the downtown area, asked for the National Guard and
ordered a curfew that would last until sunrise Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The police used tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets at
some intersections to break up the demonstrators. A small group of
men, dressed in black clothing and masks and ignoring cries of
``Shame on you!'' from other protesters, smashed windows and
spray-painted graffiti at downtown stores like Nordstrom, Niketown,
Starbucks and the Gap. Both were jarring sights in a city that
prides itself on its laid-back image.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters gathered here in opposition to the scheduled
meeting of the World Trade Organization, a global body intended to
resolve trade disputes and promote free trade. They carried banners
and chanted slogans that spoke to an eclectic array of grievances,
most of them centered around the belief that the trade organization
is a handmaiden of corporate interests whose rulings undermine
health, labor and environmental protections around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other scheduled
speakers for opening ceremonies Tuesday morning were unable to get
through the crowd, which in many cases blocked intersections by
linking hands or lying down on the street.
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of protesters already gathered downtown and about
20,000 additional marchers in a union-backed rally headed that way,
the trade body's director-general, Mike Moore, the former prime
minister of New Zealand, announced early Tuesday afternoon that the
opening ceremonies would be put off. But he vowed that the trade
talks would go on. In fact, he held meetings Tuesday with a few
trade ministers who managed to leave their hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiating groups are in full swing,'' Moore said. ``This
conference will be a success.'' Outside, protesters chanted:
``Whose world? Our world! Whose streets? Our streets!''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction of the trade delegates here seemed to run the gamut,
from bewilderment to bemusement to, in some cases, anger. As
demonstrators shouted ``Go home! Go home!'' a German delegate,
Arnold Schwez, made his way back inside the Sheraton Hotel after he
could not get through the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people don't understand the benefits of free trade to
the developing nations,'' Schwez said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday night, as Christmas lights and displays came on in
parts of downtown streets, demonstrators continued to hold their
position on the streets. A few fires, most set in trash cans,
burned in the street.

 &HT;    DEMONSTRATORS THROWING WORLD TRADE SUMMIT INTO CHAOS
 &HT;    With CLINTON-WTO-1201.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The global trading system slammed against a
broad-based backlash in blue jeans here Tuesday, as tens of
thousands of demonstrators shut down the core of this booming
Pacific port and threw a long-planned world trade conference into
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Helmeted police backed by armored vehicles fired rubber bullets
and exploding cannisters of pepper gas throughout the day to break
up demonstrations that turned violent on the opening day of a
four-day World Trade Organization meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The city declared a civil emergency as night fell, imposing
Seattle's first curfew since Vietnam-war era protests nearly three
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 5 p.m. (PT), state officials were forced to call
out the national guard to bring order to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters, some hurling stones, firebombs and firecrackers,
smashed windows in a dozen upscale department stores and shops.
Others blocked entry into the main WTO venue, forcing organizers to
delay for nearly six hours opening ceremonies for the largest
gathering of trade negotiators in history.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before President Clinton was due to arrive here, police
circled two dozen city buses to cordon off his hotel, as a tense
stand-off ensued several blocks away between a thin phalanx of riot
police and more than 20,000 protesters.
</P>
<P>
   As additional police poured into the downtown area, the city
declared an emergency curfew from 7 p.m. (PT) until sunrise,
setting the stage for a nighttime showdown with diehard protesters.
Police reported 19 arrests as of nightfall, and a series of
explosions rocked the downtown area as police cast a giant cloud of
noxious gas over the core of downtown Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes past 5 p.m. (PT), officials at the hotel Clinton
was to stay in made
</P>
<P>
   an unusual announcement _ in English, followed by Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a lock-down situation. For your safety we would ask
that those of you who are guests in this hotel please go to your
rooms at this time,'' hotel officials announced. The hotel was the
seat of the U.S. trade delegation, led by U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to arrive early Wednesday, where he plans
to address trade ministers from about 135 countries assembled here
to launch a new round of WTO negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a range of tensions resulting from the growth in
international trade. As the U.S. economy has become increasingly
linked to a global marketplace, scores of groups have rallied to
contend that the world trading system is placing profits ahead of
worker safety, the environment and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Seattle, where the WTO is meeting to launch an ambitious
round of negotiations aimed at setting the rules of global commerce
for the coming decade and beyond, environmental groups, organized
labor and others are using the event to draw a line in the sand
over world trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are helping us change the face of the global economy,''
John Sweeney, president of the giant AFL-CIO told a crowd and
estimated crowd of 35,000 at a labor rally at Memorial Stadium.
``Your presence here is proof that public opinion is fueling a
growing protest that has begun to speak to power.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, whose confederation of labor unions represents some 14
million organized workers, vowed to work to block any future trade
agreements that lack protections for workers and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will stop them,'' said Sweeney, whose constituents have
come under virulent wage and job pressures from low-cost imports
produced in countries where pay is a fraction of U.S. levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing here in Seattle is the beginning, the
beginning, of a fight we must carry to every level of government in
every country in the world,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO is an international tribunal that sets and enforces the
rules of the road in the global marketplace. If trade is the ship
powering one-sixth of the $30 trillion global economy, the WTO is
the system of buoys and navigational aides that guide it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the world's most powerful advocate of a strong WTO,
claims it has lent stability and predictability to a global trading
system that is creating hundreds of billions of dollars in new
wealth each year.
</P>
<P>
   That wealth, he contends, is helping to broaden the global
middle class, alleviate poverty and knit together a community of
nations tethered by commerce, not riven by contention.
</P>
<P>
   Its critics, though, say the WTO's enforcement powers give it
broad authority to supersede national laws, raising issues of
sovereignty and state control over the economic destiny of its
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anybody here vote to join the WTO? Anybody here paying
dues to the WTO,'' James Hoffa, president of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, asked the crowd at Tuesday's union rally.
``Then why don't we get the hell out of the WTO?''
</P>
<P>
   Rousing the crowd shortly before it held a peaceful, two-hour
march through Seattle, Hoffa drew enthusiastic cheers from
organized labor groups and others assembled on a sunny afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the ones that make the work, we are the ones that make
the profits,'' Hoffa thundered, ``and we are the ones that are
going to have a place at the table of the WTO, or we're going to
shut it down.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of high rhetoric. Air Line Pilots Association
president Duane Woerth even paraphrased Patrick Henry at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know not what course others may take,'' said Woerth, ``But
the Air Line Pilots Association isn't going to the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   Woerth said the WTO negotiators want to bring the civil aviation
industry _ worth, he said, $1 trillion a year worldwide _ under its
regulatory umbrella. That, said Woerth, would threaten unions like
the one he represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``People all over the world are getting hurt by the WTO and
their tactics,'' said Jay Boyle, 44, a telephone installer for US
West in nearby Vancouver, Wash., and a member of the Communications
Workers of America labor union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think workers in the United States understand labor
anger,'' Boyle said. ``Social unrest is something we haven't seen
since the 60s, and maybe it's time to get back to something like
that.''

 &HT;    Alison DeGenero, who saw 52 straight World Series, dies
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (s) Sports categories.)
 &HT;    By Julius Whigham II

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Whenever Alison DeGenero attended the
World Series, he usually didn't have to worry about getting a
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime Vero Beach, Fla., resident knew someone would take
care of him.
</P>
<P>
   For 52 consecutive years, he attended at least one game of the
annual Fall Classic, a feat documented by the Baseball Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the man known to many as ``DeGe'' died of natural
causes, a Vero Beach newspaper reported Tuesday. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   He had been living at a Vero Beach nursing home since late
October, after being injured in a fall.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. DeGenero, whose house featured a baseball diamond-shaped
driveway, began his string of attending the World Series games with
the 1946 contest between the Cardinals and Red Sox. But the string
ended earlier this year when his fall caused him to be briefly
hospitalized and made him miss the New York Yankees' sweep of the
Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   He was perhaps best-known in baseball circles for his World
Series string _ his tickets are prominently displayed at the
Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. _ but he also became one
of baseball's biggest ambassadors, attending games in Cuba, China,
the former Soviet Union, Australia and Italy, among other places.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never worry about finding a place to stay because I know
that I'll befriend somebody,'' Mr. DeGenero said in a 1994 Palm
Beach Post interview. ``Baseball is so beautiful. They take care of
their people better than the churches do. That's how sacred the
game is.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. DeGenero maintained his love of baseball despite losing his
eyesight to a degenerative eye disease in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   He attended each game with a tape recorder, recording memorable
moments such as the San Francisco earthquake at the 1989 World
Series. He also attended the Little League World Series in
Williamsport, Pa., every year from 1990 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is like a religion. It influences the good things,''
he once said.
</P>
<P>
   Born to Italian immigrants, Mr. DeGenero spent much of his
childhood in Ohio. He became a manufacturer of eyeglasses cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his daughter, Patricia Mong; five
grandchildren; two sisters; a brother; and five
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service will be held at 1 p.m. Friday in Vero Beach.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of flowers, his family is requesting donations be madein
his memory to the Recreation Department of Vero Beach/Indian River
County. Proceeds will benefit the county's five Little League
programs.

A RISK-TAKING PERFECTIONIST BEHIND THE CAMERA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Laura Winters' most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about the
director Francis Veber and French comedies.  
 By LAURA WINTERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Being a cinematographer is, in many ways, like being a
psychoanalyst,'' said Benoit Delhomme recently at his studio here
on the outskirts of the city. ``We let the director of a film talk,
and then, from just a few key words, we guess what's in his head
and come up with the images that he seeks.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled. ``Unlike a psychoanalyst, however, we don't have to
cure the director. On the contrary, if he's a bit mad, it's even
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Delhomme, who is one of France's leading cinematographers and
one of the few whose work is sought outside his homeland, has
fashioned the lighting, camerawork and imagery of some of the most
distinctive directors working today. Among them are the
French-Vietnamese director Tran Anh Hung (in ``The Scent of Green
Papaya'' and ``Cyclo''), the French filmmaker Cedric Klapisch (``Un
Air de Famille'' and ``When the Cat's Away''), David Mamet (``The
Winslow Boy)'' and most recently the British director Mike Figgis
in ``The Loss of Sexual Innocence'' and ``Miss Julie,'' which opens
in New York on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Delhomme, 38, has become known for his innovativeness and
versatility. While each of the 13 movies he has filmed has a
distinctly different look and style, there are some recurring
elements: rich colors, close-ups and a handheld camera technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's amazing about Benoit,'' said Klapisch, ``is that he
seems equally at home on a studio film or a small film shot on the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for his calm on the set, Delhomme is secretly a
perfectionist and a worrier. A slight man with a gentle manner, he
stands outside scanning the streets when a visitor is late. In his
atelier, his striking primitivist paintings (which he has never
exhibited) vie for space with objects that have inspired him for
various films.
</P>
<P>
   There are photographs he took in Vietnam before shooting
``Cyclo,'' a lump of salt from the Tunisian desert location of
``The Loss of Sexual Innocence'' and books of paintings that
inspired his explorations of light for ``Miss Julie,'' Figgis'
adaptation of the 1888 August Strindberg play about a young,
disturbed aristocrat and her father's manservant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Julie'' seems to be a departure from ``The Loss of Sexual
Innocence,'' the first collaboration between Figgis and Delhomme.
While ``Sexual Innocence'' is a sprawling contemporary story filmed
in several different countries, ``Miss Julie'' is a period drama
filmed on one set and featuring only three principal actors:
Saffron Burrows as Miss Julie, Peter Mullan as the servant, Jean,
and Maria Doyle Kennedy as Jean's fiancee, Christine.
</P>
<P>
   Both films, however, were filmed in Super-16mm, which involves a
lighter camera than the standard 35mm, and both were shot with two
mostly handheld cameras manned by Delhomme and by Figgis himself.
</P>
<P>
   Figgis (who perhaps is best known for ``Leaving Las Vegas'')
developed this method to allow greater mobility. He is a director
who plunges into all aspects of filmmaking: composing the score (as
he did in ``Miss Julie'' and ``Leaving Las Vegas'') or working a
camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was searching for a cinematographer who would not get upset
if I wanted to operate a camera as well,'' he said by telephone
from Los Angeles. ``With Benoit, I found a kindred spirit. On the
two films, he lit and did all the main operating, and whenever I
had the opportunity I went in and got shots on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Miss Julie,'' the actors move freely around the kitchen
where much of the action is set while the camera circles them,
swooping in for sudden close-ups and then zooming away
vertiginously. Although the actors are in period dress, the effect
is both modern and intimate.
</P>
<P>
   Delhomme relished what he calls ``the crossfire of cameras,''
adding, ``Mike didn't want `Miss Julie' to be the usual heavy
costume drama. It was as if the actors were wild beasts let out of
their cages, and we had to scramble to capture their every
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The ``wild beasts'' found this liberating as well. ``We were
doing what felt right for the characters,'' said Ms. Burrows, whose
Miss Julie has a feral intensity. ``I never felt so alive at
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Delhomme wanted to create a lighting setup that would not only
permit filming from all angles but also create the luminous glow of
a Swedish midsummer night. Inspired by the paintings of the
Norwegian artist Edvard Munch and of the Danish painter Vilhelm
Hammershoi, he eventually settled on a big, soft overhead light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always do research, but I don't recreate paintings on
screen,'' he said. ``For me, the worst thing you can say about a
film is that it is `painterly.' Paintings are static. Films have to
breathe, to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before Delhomme was interested in either painting or
cinematography, he was an amateur photographer. He grew up in
Cherbourg, in northwest France, and as an adolescent spent hours in
the darkroom. His family has an artistic bent: his grandfather,
Georges Delhomme, was a painter and designer of perfume bottles for
Lancome.
</P>
<P>
   Benoit's brother, Jean-Philippe Delhomme, is an artist who
illustrated, among other things, a talked-about 1993 advertising
campaign for Barneys, featuring whimsically drawn figures
accompanied by ironic headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Young Benoit became interested in film, but from the standpoint
of creating images rather than directing. He attended the
prestigious Ecole Louis Lumiere in Paris, graduating in 1982, and
served as an assistant cameraman and short-film cinematographer
before meeting Tran Anh Hung in 1991. Tran asked him to collaborate
on his first and then his second feature, ``The Scent of Green
Payaya'' (1993) and ``Cyclo'' (1995).
</P>
<P>
   ``Papaya,'' which was filmed inside a Paris studio, is a
tranquil, loving evocation of a bygone era in Vietnam. ``Cyclo,''
which was shot verite-style on the streets of Saigon, is virtuosic,
fractured and violent.
</P>
<P>
   These two films, which won many awards, showed off Delhomme's
range internationally and gave him the entree to work with
English-speaking directors like Mamet. Here, again, Delhomme
rendered a play (``The Winslow Boy'') cinematically vivid by basing
the look of the film on John Singer Sargent's portraits.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he shot Benoit Jacquot's ``Sade'' in France, starring
Daniel Auteuil as the infamous Marquis, and is now considering
several Hollywood projects, albeit warily. ``The rules can be so
important for a Hollywood film that one risks losing the lightness
of a European film,'' he said. ``I'd like to do a big film, though,
if it was personal for the director.''
</P>
<P>
   For Delhomme, this personal touch is critical; he makes it clear
that his own sensibility is in service to a director's vision. When
asked what he himself seeks in an image, he grows animated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to feel the grain of the actor's skin, direct and
pure,'' he replies. ``I hate those films where there is this
diffuse light over everything, like a golden sauce. There are
cinematographers who are like great cooks, but with every film they
do, they give you the same thing to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs. ``Whereas for me the important thing is to take
risks. I want to give you the elements raw, or at least change the
sauce every time.''

BUSH TO CALL FOR SWEEPING TAX CUTS IN SPEECH ON WEDNESDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (12:01 a.m. ET EMBARGO for print and electronic media.) 
(sw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush will lay out the centerpiece of
his economic agenda on Wednesday, calling for sweeping cuts in
income tax rates, a tax break for many married couples and an
increase in the child credit, his aides said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, valued by the Bush campaign at $483 billion over
five years starting in 2002, seemed certain to ignite debate among
his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, and drew
fire on Tuesday from Vice President Al Gore, who called it fiscally
irresponsible even before its details were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-cutting package, which would be financed out of
anticipated budget surpluses, would be larger than the tax cut
passed by the Republican-led Congress last summer and vetoed by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The plan seeks to shore up Bush's standing as a traditional
economic conservative even as it addresses his theme of helping the
working poor. But like Republicans in Congress, Bush faces a
complicated task in selling a big tax reduction. With the economy
strong and many people feeling prosperous, polls show that the
electorate is more interested in using the nation's newfound fiscal
health to address other issues, like education and the solvency of
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal _ to be unveiled in a speech in Des Moines on
Wednesday _ would reduce taxes across the income spectrum gradually
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthy would see the top income tax rate reduced from 39.6
percent to 33 percent. The 28 percent and 31 percent rates paid by
many middle-class taxpayers would be consolidated and reduced to 25
percent. Lower income families would benefit from the creation of a
new 10 percent tax bracket that would apply to much of the income
currently taxed at 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would also double the child credit to $1,000 and allow
more affluent families to claim the credit than under current law.
It would benefit many married couples by reviving a deduction based
on the lower-earning spouse's income. And it would phase out the
inheritance tax on large estates over eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The plan does not contain any reduction in taxes on capital
gains.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the plan sticks closely to Republican orthodoxy,
concentrating its benefits on the upper end of the income scale,
the people who pay the most taxes, while also appealing to
middle-income families.
</P>
<P>
   One of its unstated messages is that Bush _ more than his
father, who as president broke a vow not to raise taxes and who
once derided the supply-side tax-cutting philosophy as ``voodoo
economics'' _ can be counted on by his party's conservative base to
do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is simply an effort to show that he's a serious candidate
who has ticked off all the little boxes of things you're supposed
to do when you run for president,'' said Bruce Bartlett, a former
Treasury Department official in the Reagan and Bush
administrations. ``The important thing is that it touches all the
various bases, that it's small enough not to be considered fiscally
irresponsible but substantial enough that it means something to the
people who he feels need to be given something in the tax area.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's proposal is also his first major effort to put a
detailed policy behind his theme of ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   His advisers said the combination of the new 10 percent rate and
the increase in the child credit was intended to help working poor
families. Under the current tax code, those families lose a
substantial portion of tax breaks available to them through the
earned income tax credit _ and therefore face much bigger tax bills
_ as their income approaches middle-class levels.
</P>
<P>
   By the Bush campaign's calculations, the changes would remove 6
million families from the federal income tax rolls, or 20 percent
of all families with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a plan that will reduce the upper rate,'' Bush told
reporters in Chicago on Tuesday. ``It's a plan also that recognizes
that our current system is not fair. If you're a single mother with
children, and you live on the outskirts of poverty, and you work
hard, as you move toward the middle class, you pay an enormous
rate.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts said the tax cuts would go overwhelmingly to
the wealthy, and would do less for low-income people than Bush
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree that there's much for low income,'' said Iris J.
Lav, deputy director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,
a liberal-leaning research organization in Washington. ``Even the
things that look like low income are really middle income, and as I
understand the rate structure, you're really talking about a
massive tax cut for high-income people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is putting out his economic plan as he prepares for his
first debate with his rivals for the Republican nomination on
Thursday night in New Hampshire, and is clearly eager to show that
he has a detailed agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But he is also risking criticism from some of his Republican
opponents as being too timid on tax cuts. From the Democratic side,
Bush is already under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Even before knowing the Bush plan's details, Gore criticized its
approach on Tuesday, saying that like the tax bill passed by
Republicans in Congress this year it would endanger the nation's
fiscal health. Campaigning in New Hampshire, Gore said Bush had
endorsed ``a truly reckless tax scheme that would immediately put
our country back into deficits.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan was developed by a team of economists headed by
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former Federal Reserve governor and policy
aide to President George Bush. The team also included Michael
Boskin, who was chief economist in the Bush White House, and John
F. Cogan, who was a budget official in the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   The size of Bush's plan was determined in part by projections of
the size of the budget surplus. Both parties in Washington have
agreed that the portion of the projected surplus generated by
excess Social Security revenue _ about $2 trillion over the next
decade _ should be off limits for tax cuts or new spending. But the
rest of the surplus _ the portion generated by general tax revenue
_ is up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's economic team estimated that the non-Social Security
surplus during the first five years of their tax cut would be $586
billion. That estimate is higher than current surplus estimates by
the Congressional Budget Office and the White House, although their
estimates are likely to be increased in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said there was still considerable uncertainty about
how big the surpluses will be, in part because the current
projections are based on assumptions that spending increases will
remain far more limited than they have been in each of the past few
years.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two police officers noticed Pete Rose and waved to
him when he emerged from a hotel in midtown Manhattan. Rose turned
left and began walking toward a sports cafe for a news conference,
and another man stopped and shook his hand. Another man, who had
been consumed with lighting a cigarette, dropped the match, nudged
his friend and shouted, ``Look, it's Pete Rose.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rose was mostly oblivious to the attention he received
Tuesday on Seventh Avenue, because he was too busy talking about
getting the chance to be reinstated to baseball. Rose was talking
quickly and walking quickly, and probably would have lectured all
the pedestrians at West 46th Street and Seventh about why he
deserves to be in baseball and in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Commissioner Bud Selig has repeatedly said that he
has seen no new evidence that would lead him to overturn the
lifetime ban that Rose agreed to in 1989 because of his gambling on
professional sports, the sides will meet to discuss Rose's status
in January. Rose sent a letter to Selig eight days ago seeking
reinstatement. Selig responded by giving the letter to Robert
Dupuy, baseball's executive vice president for administration, who
will meet with Roger Makley, Rose's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it'll lead to anything,'' Rose said. ``But it
can't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig, who has been described by associates as being rigid in
his feelings about not reinstating Rose, was cautious in describing
the meeting as more of a courtesy than an initial step toward
reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Rose's attorney has written me a letter,'' Selig told The
Associated Press. ``I read it very thoughtfully, very carefully,
and turned it over to Dupuy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose would not specify what evidence Makley will present to
Dupuy, but he claimed that he had spent $1.5 million in assembling
his case 10 years ago and that it will include handwriting and
fingerprint experts and witnesses who will talk about gambling.
John Dowd, the lawyer who was hired by baseball to investigate
Rose's gambling, said in his report that he obtained betting slips
that handwriting and fingerprint analysis verified had been used by
Rose. There are eight people in the Dowd report who said they had
some knowledge of Rose betting on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying for 10 years that I didn't bet on baseball,''
Rose said. ``Why am I going to change my mind now?''
</P>
<P>
   When Rose was asked if he would amend his statements from the
Dowd report to concede that he had bet on baseball, he said,
``Forget about that.'' He added that he would not accept an
agreement in which he is allowed to go into the Hall of Fame and is
still banned from baseball because he's a ``baseball person'' and
would like to return to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, the career hits leader, said he should be reinstated if
his lawyer proves he did not bet on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were a judge, wouldn't you reinstate me if I could
prove that?'' Rose said. ``Or are you going to be one of those
people who still believe I did it?''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement that Rose reached with A. Bartlett Giamatti, the
commissioner at the time, was not deemed an admission or a denial
of the allegation that Rose bet on baseball. But the agreement also
said the commissioner had a ``factual basis'' to impose the
lifetime penalty and that Rose could not challenge it in court.
Still, when Rose was asked what he would do if the meeting between
Makley and Dupuy does not somehow lead toward reinstatement, he
said: ``You always have legal options. But I'm not looking for a
fight. I'm a lover, not a fighter. Give my people a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose said that he has uttered ``I'm sorry'' in hundreds of
interviews, but that ``not everybody is going to hear you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry for the mistakes I've made,'' Rose said. ``I'm sorry
for betting on football through a bookmaker. I was wrong. Although
I'm as sorry as I can be, I didn't hurt anybody but my family. I
disagree with people who say I tarnished the game of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose asked: ``How did I tarnish the game of baseball? Did I
tarnish the game as much as calling off the World Series? The
strike? The lockout?
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, I tarnished myself. I'm sorry I did that. Do you
think I wished this to happen? If it didn't, I'd probably have
several million dollars in the bank and still be managing the
Cincinnati Reds.''  &QL;

<P>
   The New York Times Co. on Tuesday dismissed 23 employees at an
administrative center in Norfolk, Va., for violating the company's
e-mail policy, said a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The workers _ men and women in a variety of departments and
functions _ were among 200 employees at a center that processes
invoices, pay and benefits for the company's various divisions.
</P>
<P>
   An unspecified number of other employees received disciplinary
warning letters over the incident, which involved internally
circulated e-mail, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The company would not elaborate on the basis for the dismissal
except to say that the employees had violated a policy specifying
that ``computer communications must be consistent with conventional
standards of ethical and proper conduct, behavior and manners and
are not to be used to create, forward or display any offensive or
disruptive messages, including photographs, graphics and audio
materials.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times Co. had dismissed ``a person here or there'' over
e-mail violations in the past, but never a group of such size, said
company spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen.  &QL;

 &HT;    Protesters in Texas decry WTO
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The international trade agreement protests in
Seattle echoed in Austin streets Tuesday as consumer, labor and
environmental groups rallied at the Capitol to call for abolition
of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at the peaceful rally here, which drew about 400
people, denounced what they said was the WTO's power to force
nations to accept genetically altered food, products made with
slave or very low-wage labor, and lower environmental standards,
all in the name of ensuring free trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a turning point in American politics,'' said
Robert Jensen, a journalism professor at the University of Texas
and moderator of the rally. The protesters, he said, were ``saying
no to the guys in the suits.''
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker, Renu Namjose of Texas Consumers for Safe Foods,
criticized WTO rulings that have required countries to allow
imports of scientifically altered food. The WTO, for example, ruled
that European Union nations must allow the sale of hormone-treated
beef after the United States protested a ban on such imports.
</P>
<P>
   Namjose said a nation should retain the right to ban such
altered foods. ``Remember, gene pollution cannot be cleaned up or
brought back on recall.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Harrington, state director of the AFL-CIO, said American
corporations have exploited Mexican workers under the North
American Free Trade Agreement by moving manufacturing south of the
border and paying low wages.
</P>
<P>
   While the Austin demonstrations were peaceful, meetings of the
135-nation World Trade Organization were delayed Tuesday by
protests during which police fired pepper spray at demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   The central issue in Seattle is who gets to make the rules,
Harrington said, charging that ordinary workers and others
concerned with the environment and human rights are not consulted
in writing the trade rules and settling disputes.
</P>
<P>
   But as groups as diverse as the Teamsters, the Sierra Club and
the Gray Panthers protested in Austin on Tuesday, a business group
touted the benefits of free trade with a new study showing how much
Texas and Travis County depend on exports for jobs and sales.
</P>
<P>
   The study was commissioned by the Texas International Trade
Alliance. The alliance is a part of the goTRADE initiative launched
by The Business Roundtable, an association of chief executive
officers of major corporations committed to free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Among the study's findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Travis County about 300 manufacturers _ most of them
employing 20 or fewer workers _ exported $2.54 billion in goods and
products in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   _ Countries in the Asian Pacific Rim and South Asia are the top
export markets for Travis County manufacturers; 85 percent of the
manufacturers sold products to Asia; 84 percent to Europe; 82
percent to Canada; and 70 percent to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   _ Products exported from Travis County include semiconductors,
heart valves, golf clubs, computers, orthopedic implants, concert
lighting, Italian food products, oil field equipment,
telecommunications gear and interactive multimedia video
conferencing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Statewide, exporting manufacturers in Texas employ about
614,000 workers, and 117,000 of those were directly related to
overseas sales.
</P>
<P>
   The trade alliance issued a statement from U.S. Rep. Lloyd
Doggett, D-Austin, who said that ``international trade equals jobs
for the working men and women in Central Texas, particularly in the
high-tech industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, Doggett said, ``clearly demonstrates that in order
for the technology sector in Central Texas to be successful we must
be able to export our products to other countries.''

U.S. OFFICIALS NO LONGER WORRY ABOUT YELTSIN'S HEALTH PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not long ago, whenever Boris Yeltsin caught a cold,
the more nervous Kremlin watchers in the Clinton administration
reacted with alarm. But this week, Yeltsin caught pneumonia, and
Washington stifled a yawn.
</P>
<P>
   That casual response offers a revealing glimpse of how
Washington apparently believes that Yeltsin's health is no longer
critical to the relationship with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that officials have grown skeptical or callous
about the Russian president's troubled health. It is also that they
now apparently believe that Russia's fledgling democracy is
becoming stable enough to outlast him.
</P>
<P>
   The latest announcement that Yeltsin has been hospitalized with
pneumonia for the fourth time in less than two years was made as
the Russian people and U.S. officials have come to accept his
erratic behavior, periodic disappearances and chronic health
problems as par for course.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has been reporting to the administration this year that
the periods when Yeltsin disappears have been increasing and that
his ability to function in his job appears to be eroding.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials acknowledge that Washington does not
have good information about some closely guarded aspects of
Yeltsin's health. ``There is not much openness on everything that
ails him,'' one official said. ``I don't think we have a good sense
of everything that may be bothering him.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials stress that they do not need the CIA to tell them
that Yeltsin is disengaged, for health as well as other reasons.
That report is all over the Russian press. ``His disengagement is
not news,'' one official said. `It's not a secret that he is less
involved than he used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they were confident that Yeltsin's problems did
not threaten his life.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton told reporters Tuesday that he had been
informed that Yeltsin had a simple case of pneumonia. ``I checked
on it yesterday, and they believe that he will be all right,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's spokesman said he was spoke by telephone from his
hospital with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, , who is on a
visit.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, 68, had a heart bypass in 1996, and his health,
reportedly worsened by drinking, has been a recurring problem. He
had a bout of pneumonia last November and a bleeding stomach ulcer
this year.
</P>
<P>
   After each health crisis, however, Yeltsin has re-emerged. In
fact, he can still display a burst of energy for important meetings
with foreign leaders, as he did in Istanbul at the 54-nation
conference on European security in mid-November. Administration
officials said Clinton had commented on the fact that Yeltsin had a
firm handshake and a steady gaze and talked in an animated
rapid-fire style.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials recognize that Yeltsin appears to have only
sporadic involvement in the day-to-day running of the Russian
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``His involvement now seems to be mostly in significant
international events,'' noted one administration official. ``There
is a trend in which he has reduced his involvement in national
affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Yeltsin's term winding down and next year's election to
name his successor looming, administration officials believe that
even Yeltsin's declining condition would not derail the Russian
political process. Direct challenges to his presidency no longer
seem likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``His health isn't as sensitive an issue in Russian politics as
it used to be,'' said an administration official. ``It now looks
more likely than not that the constitutional processes would be
followed if he passed from the scene. There has been a steady
institutionalization of the constitutional rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's popularity _ coming after
Yeltsin's practice of firing a succession of prime ministers _ also
has suggested that new leaders are emerging in Moscow, and that
they plan to fight for power through the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great achievement today that nobody in Russia seems to
be thinking about taking power in any other means than by the
ballot box,'' said Keith Bush, a Russian analyst at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ``I think we
often lose sight of how big an accomplishment that is.''

WTO VIOLENCE PUTS ANARCHISTS IN SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH TIECHROEB  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Anarchists represented a tiny fraction of thousands of
mostly peaceful protesters in Seattle Tuesday, but their violent
tactics put them on center stage as they rampaged through downtown,
smashing store windows with hammers, spray-painting buildings and
slashing tires.
</P>
<P>
   The self-proclaimed anarchists appeared to be mostly teenagers
and twentysomethings who donned black ski masks and black clothes
sporting an anarchist symbol of the letter ``A'' in a circle.
</P>
<P>
   The circled ``A'' is one of the most familiar symbols of
anarchism and represents the slogan ``Anarchy is Order''. Other
symbols of anarchy include a black flag and a red-and-black flag.
</P>
<P>
   A 28-year-old Oregon protester who identified himself only as
``Smoke'' said the rampage was justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of property is violent,'' said the man, wearing a
black army helmet with the circled ``A'' symbol. ``Some people are
focusing their energy on the WTO instead of capitalism in general.
Even if we stop the WTO here, we're not stopping capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   He called nonviolent protesters ``peace police'' and accused
them of ``pushing their views on some of us who are more radical.''
</P>
<P>
   Another protester, who said he is 24 but would not give his
name, said that the real violence was being perpetrated by
corporations and governments against the world's natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Police Chief Norm Stamper said at a news conference
Tuesday afternoon that a small number of protesters were causing
the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wild card, if you will, is that we have protestors from
all over the world in Seattle,'' Stamper said, referring to the
anarchists.
</P>
<P>
   The anarchist movement represents a range of groups, from
organized and primarily nonviolent groups like the International
Workers of the World to loosely-knit and more extremist splinter
groups such as the Eugene, Ore.-based Black Army Faction.
</P>
<P>
   Members of IWW, usually called Wobblies, were pivotal in the
Seattle General Strike in February 1919 when 60,000 workers stayed
home, shutting down the city.
</P>
<P>
   Anarchist thought, which dates back at least to the 18th
century, supports resistance to the state and capitalism, and
encompasses a broad, and often vague, political platform.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, anarchist philosophy has been linked to Marxism,
some forms of trade unionism and international conflicts like the
Spanish and Russian civil wars.
</P>

   During the last decade, the small but growing U.S. movement has
tackled new enemies like technology and world trade.

   Many of the younger generation of anarchists believe in using
extreme measures, including violence against property, to achieve
their goals.

   ``They're saying, ``Enough is enough'' _ we don't have time to

</P>
<P>
   A 17-year-old protester called ``Rain'' said protests in the
1960s failed to overthrow the government because ``they were
passive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rain said concerns run the gamut from excessive consumerism,
environmental issues to general urban despair of poverty and
homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   She also said spray-painting and property damage are effective
tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun and it gets people's attention,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An 18-year-old Seattle man, who identified himself as ``Meth'',
said he had participated in spray-painting anarchy symbols on
downtown jewelry stores and other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is greed,'' the man said. ``Where else would an anarchy
symbol belong.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, anarchists in Eugene have vandalized a
police van, writing ``Die Pig'' across the back window, and
launched attacks against local computer software and Nike outlets.
A radical anarchist faction also claimed responsibility for an
arson fire that burned down a Eugene meat-packing plant last May.

   STAFF OF FTC OPPOSES BP AMOCO-ARCO MERGER
</P>
<P>
   The staff of the Federal Trade Commission has concluded that the
proposed $29 billion merger between BP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield
violates antitrust law and has recommended that the commission
block the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation was based on concerns that the merger could
result in significantly higher gasoline prices in California and
the West Coast. Those states are supplied crude oil from the North
Slope of Alaska, where exploration and production are dominated by
BP Amoco and ARCO.

</P>
<P>
   Umang Gupta, the chairman and chief executive of Keynote
Systems, which measures Web site performance for e-commerce
companies, did not start out wanting to be an entrepreneur. But
Gupta eventually caught the entrepreneurial bug, joined some
start-ups and started his own company. In 1997, he made an
investment in Keynote. A few months later the board asked him to
take over as chief executive. Gupta's stake in the company is now
worth more than $125 million.

   POLICE AND WTO PROTESTERS CLASH
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of the World Trade Organization was thrown into

EDITORIAL: ACCOUNTABILITY AND ARAFAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Dec. 1:
</P>
<P>
   Corruption and patronage are serious problems in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip territories administered by Yasser Arafat and the
Palestinian Authority. But when 20 prominent Palestinian academics
and political leaders signed a protest letter accusing Arafat's
administration of ``opening the door to opportunists who are
spreading corruption throughout Palestinian society,'' eight were
jailed and two more held under house arrest. Eight other signers,
who are elected members of the Palestinian Legislative Council,
face efforts to strip them of their parliamentary immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The petition also accused Arafat of ruling tyrannically and
yielding too much in negotiations with Israel. But by most
accounts, it was the deserved rebuke on corruption that provoked
the arrests. Such squelching of needed debate on important but
sensitive subjects would be unfortunate at any time. It is
especially so as peace talks with Israel accelerate and Palestinian
administration in the West Bank and Gaza prepares for more of the
responsibilities associated with statehood. The Palestinian
political institutions now emerging need to be accountable and
democratic enough to inspire confidence at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Since its creation five years ago, the Palestinian Authority's
effectiveness has been undermined by the concentration of power in
the hands of Arafat, an abusive security force and a public
administration bloated by patronage appointments. Social services
and economic development have too often been shaped by the
arbitrary decisions of Arafat's lieutenants. Efforts by the elected
legislature to enforce accountability and combat corruption have
been ignored. Up to 20 percent of the authority's revenue is
excluded from the official budget and spent by Arafat virtually
without oversight.
</P>
<P>
   One of Arafat's security officials defended the latest arrests
by arguing that the middle of final-status negotiations was ``not
the right time to demand accountability.'' The truth is just the
opposite. Arafat must learn to listen to his critics instead of
jailing them.

EGYPTIAN AND U.S. OFFICIALS COOPERATE ON CRASH INVESTIGATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID JOHNSTON and MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his first public comments on the crash of
EgyptAir Flight 990, the director of the FBI, Louis J. Freeh, said
Tuesday that the Egyptian authorities were cooperating with the
inquiry into the cause of the crash and would investigate a list of
leads at the request of American law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh, speaking with reporters at the FBI headquarters, said
that the authorities in Cairo were assisting American investigators
even though Egyptian officials have dismissed the principal
American theory that a reserve pilot might have deliberately
brought down the airliner.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development, aviation safety experts and Egyptian
investigators have completed a transcript of the cockpit voice
recorder in Arabic, but have not completed an English translation,
an official at the National Transportation Safety Board said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian and American linguists must agree on the translation,
and aircraft experts must identify whatever nonspeech sounds they
can. Then they must synchronize the words and sounds on the tape
with events recorded on the other ``black box,'' the flight data
recorder, the official said. The date for finishing that work has
gradually been moved back, though the board now hopes to finish by
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   American investigators have not ruled out any possibility for
the Oct. 31 crash but have primarily centered their effort on Gamil
al-Batouti, an EgyptAir reserve pilot. They theorize that it was
Batouti who pitched the Boeing 767 into a steep dive toward the
Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft crashed in the sea about 60 miles
south of Nantucket, killing all 217 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said that the Egyptian authorities had complied with every
American request for assistance, supplying personnel and aircraft
maintenance records that have been turned over to the FBI and the
National Transportation Safety Board, which is in charge of the
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're receiving cooperation at this time,'' Freeh said.
``We've not had any request turned down.'' Freeh added that the FBI
had reached no conclusions about the cause of the crash.
``Everything is on the table,'' he said. ``Everything is being
considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, other law enforcement officials said that the
requests to the Egyptians, including requests for more information
about the backgrounds of Batouti and other crew members, implied
that investigators believe Batouti might have been responsible.
Egyptian officials have said that an undetected mechanical failure
might have been responsible for the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said he had been consulting closely with aviation safety
officials, and he talked Tuesday with James E. Hall, chairman of
the aviation safety board. Freeh said he discussed the continuing
recovery of wreckage from the ocean bottom.
</P>
<P>
   A large civilian ship chartered by the Navy, the Smit Pioneer,
is expected to arrive from Lisbon at the safety board's operations
headquarters in Quonset, R.I., by Monday. It will spend several
days being prepared to move to the crash site. The ship is heavy
enough to operate in rough early winter seas.
</P>
<P>
   Since the crash, the Navy has been using a small
remote-controlled submarine to map the debris field, as weather
allows.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh and Hall have discussed whether to transfer responsibility
for the inquiry to the FBI _ an action that would indicate that
authorities suspect a criminal act in the crash. But Tuesday, Freeh
said such a step would have little practical impact on the pace or
direction of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   A safety board official said that at some point after the
Egyptian and American team completes the translation of the cockpit
voice recorder, Hall may ``characterize'' its contents, but his
agency will not make public the transcript itself if, as many
aviation safety investigators hope, the investigation is turned
over to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the safety board have raised the possibility that
the Egyptian government, which delegated the investigation to the
United States a few hours after the crash, might seek to rescind
that assignment if American officials conclude that the crash
should be investigated by the FBI.

SOTHEBY'S AND WINE DEALER END AUCTION ARRANGEMENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Britain)   By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After five years of auctioning fine and rare wines
together, Sherry-Lehmann and Sotheby's have parted company.
</P>
<P>
   The split was announced Monday, nine days after a two-day sale
that brought in $14.4 million, setting a world record for wine
auctions by eclipsing a 1997 Christie's sale in London that
realized $11.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, Sherry-Lehmann, a Madison Avenue store
with a national clientele, and Sotheby's, the international auction
house, said they ``have mutually agreed to pursue different
courses.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Aaron, the chairman of Sherry-Lehmann, and Serena
Sutcliffe, the director of Sotheby's international wine department,
said in the statement that since both organizations began sharing
auctions in 1994 they ``always thought of this as a three- to
five-year commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   They added, ``We believe that this is the right time for each of
us to pursue our different directions'' in this ``expanding
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sutcliffe, reached in London, declined to go into detail
about the differences, but said Sotheby's would soon announce the
name of a new partner and that it expected to hold auctions in New
York next year.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said, ``We could not agree upon a contract,'' adding only,
``Basically, a contract is about one thing: economics.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Sherry-Lehmann, which has retail sales ``in excess of
$30 million a year,'' was contemplating holding its own auctions by
the middle of 2000. ``We have a very good auction team here
already,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's said that in 24 auctions since 1994, the team had
grossed $64.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, independent auction houses like Sotheby's,
Christie's and Phillips International can conduct wine auctions
only if they have as a collaborator a wine merchant who has held a
license for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   If Sherry-Lehmann goes it alone, it will join Manhattan
merchants like Morrell &AMP; Co. and Acker Merrall &AMP; Condit, which have
sponsored auctions for years without the assistance of professional
auction houses.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry-Lehmann With Sotheby's, as the partnership had been
called, has gone head to head against Zachys-Christie's, which
joins a $20-million-a-year merchant in Scarsdale, N.Y., with the
auction firm.
</P>
<P>
   In 32 auctions since 1995, Zachys-Christie's, which also holds
auctions in Los Angeles, has grossed $72.5 million. In Manhattan,
it sells wine at Christie's new headquarters at Rockefeller Plaza
and at Christie's East.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the London-based Phillips International Auctioneers,
whose partner in Manhattan-based auctions is the Park Avenue Liquor
Shop, was bought by Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Just as two 16-year-old girls began quarreling loudly
over a magazine in the lunchroom at Curie High School here, an
assistant principal stepped in to lay down the law.
</P>
<P>
   No punches had been thrown, no hair pulled but the incident
became a part of the girls' official record. They were ``written
up'' for the infraction, banished to a detention room for the rest
of the day and told that their parents would be notified.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have disrupted the lunchroom,'' the assistant principal,
Rochelle Wade, told the girls.
</P>
<P>
   Their punishment reflects a widespread crackdown on misconduct
in American schools. A zero-tolerance approach _ much of it
directed at behavior that administrators would once have dealt with
entirely by issuing a rebuke on the spot _ has been brought on by
school shootings from coast to coast and by officials' fear of bias
lawsuits arising from policies that provide for discretion in
punishment and its severity.
</P>
<P>
   While precise national figures on school punishment are sketchy,
experts agree that as a result of the new approach, the country is
witnessing a vast increase in detentions, suspensions and even
expulsions, in which the ousted offenders are typically made to
attend alternative schools. In Chicago, the expulsion rate has
jumped nearly tenfold in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond a crackdown on weapons and drugs _ zero tolerance for
which typically means automatic expulsion _ the new school-conduct
ethos has profoundly changed views about what was once deemed
usual, if annoying, behavior by adolescents. No longer is the
playground scrap or the kickball tussle deemed a rite of passage
best settled by a teacher who orders the combatants to their
corners, hears out the warring sides and demands apologies and a
handshake.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new get-tough policies, aggressive behavior like
pushing, shoving or general roughhousing is typically viewed as
violence, and teachers are often forbidden to resolve any physical
confrontation with a lecture. Instead, they must file a report with
administrators, so that a uniform policy can run its course:
punishments for specific offenses are themselves very specific, and
rare is the student who is granted leniency.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say a tough, uniform approach to even lesser
infractions is necessary to create an atmosphere of discipline in
the schoolhouse.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are different today,'' said Gerald Tirozzi,
executive director of the National Association of Secondary School
Principals. ``Years ago we didn't have hundreds of knives and guns
in schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence in support of the proponents' argument comes from
Baltimore, where a new policy requires that disruptive behavior
bring automatic suspension or expulsion, with assignment to an
alternative school. Officials there say the hard-line approach has
brought a 31 percent drop in criminal activity in the city's high
schools.
</P>
<P>
   While agreeing that weapons cannot be tolerated in schools, some
educators and psychologists, have raised concerns that rigid
discipline sometimes treats youthful rambunction as criminal
behavior, and leaves little room for discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Noam, a professor of education at Harvard University, has
criticized what he calls a ``heavily bureaucratized, cookbook
approach'' to resolving individual cases with blanket policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable where this is coming from,'' said Noam,
noting that pressure has been mounting on schools to stem violence,
especially after recent school shootings ``People are very
concerned about safety. Parents demand these stricter codes. And it
sells well.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the loss of discretion and on-the-spot resolutions
can mean ``a lost moment to teach children about respect,'' and a
missed chance to inspire trust of authority figures.
</P>
<P>
   Some 90 percent of schools use a zero tolerance policy with set
punishments for guns or other weapons, according to a recent report
by the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Program of the U.S.
Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 90 percent of schools use such policies for alcohol and
drugs, and nearly 80 percent set specific punishments for violence,
use of tobacco and other infractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We possibly have gotten a little tougher over the last five
years,'' said Gretchen O'Neil, a spokeswoman for the Boston
schools.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City beginning last year, school safety officers
were placed under the supervision of the city police department,
and infractions on school premises are treated as offenses
according to the penal code.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the kind of thing like a fistfight on the schools grounds,
I don't understand why it would trigger an arrest,'' William C.
Thompson Jr., president of the New York Board of Education, said at
a recent board meeting. ``But there does appear to be an increase
in arrests for things like fistfights. That's a concern.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the get-tough policy is largely the creation of the
school chief, Paul Vallas, who has won praise for improving test
scores and bringing order to classrooms. Punishments range from
detentions to two-year expulsions. The discipline code applies to
students 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If a student gets in
trouble with the police on Saturday, the school will take action on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The tougher approach has won praise among many experts on
adolescence, who say children must learn that unacceptable behavior
means certain punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ewing a professor of law and psychology at New York
State University in Buffalo, and a school consultant on safety
matters, urges educators to suspend any student who engages in
violence or even threatens it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must look at kids as potential violent actors,'' Ewing
said. ``You must develop an absolute zero tolerance policy.
Unacceptable acts must be met swiftly and harshly. It's the only
hope we have of turning this thing around.''
</P>
<P>
   But Noam of Harvard said schools bent on discipline should not
forget about justice. Not every mistake must necessarily translate
to severe punishment for children, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely there are consequences for actions,'' he said. ``But
when a police officer stops someone for speeding, he doesn't write
a ticket every time.''
</P>
<P>
   The zero tolerance policies largely grew out of the Safe and
Drug Free School Act of 1994, which stipulates that schools must
expel any student found with a weapon, or lose federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   These policies have gone well beyond drugs and weapons, with
many schools using a comprehensive set of standards of conduct and
punishment, from dress codes to tardiness. In part, the uniform
policies are designed to avoid lawsuits claiming that a student was
unfairly treated.
</P>
<P>
   Tirozzi, of the school principals group, said lawsuits against
schools have soared in recent years, and that school administrators
are ``always looking over their shoulders,'' for a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Rigid codes are designed to remove discretion and insure
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you treat Johnny one way, and he's black, and you treat
Joey another way, and he's white, you've got a problem,'' Tirozzi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts on child development say the prevailing attitudes
in schools tries to make docile creatures out of normal, spirited
adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gurian, a family therapist and the author of ``The Good
Son'' (Putnam 1999), argues that rigid policies have ``essentially
criminalized'' the sort of aggressive behavior that is normal for
young people, especially boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have confused aggression and violence,'' he said. ``Every
primate is aggressive. There is nothing wrong with being
aggressive. There is something wrong with being violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan First, the executive director of the National Coalition of
Advocates for Students, a Boston-based group that focuses on
children at risk of dropping out of school, said the policies are
part of a broader anti-youth sentiment prevalent in America. She
noted the popularity of juveniles charged with crimes being sent to
adult courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising a child is about patience,'' she said. ``It seems to
me that zero-tolerance policies are the ultimate impatience.''
</P>
<P>
   To William Damon, the director of the Center on Adolescence at
Stanford University, students are hungering for the clarity of
clear rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a consistent policy that is firm,'' he said, ``and
you need follow-through.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Moore, the executive director of Designs for Change, a
private group that studies education, said most expulsions have
nothing to do with drugs or violence. He said some schools are
dropping truants from the enrollment rolls, in part, out of a
desire to rid themselves of marginal students and improve test
scores.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the tougher policy, including Moore, say
troubled students are simply being set adrift, destined to cause
problems that will exact a much greater toll on society. Precisely
that view has been advanced by the Rev. Jesse Jackson in his
protest over the expulsion of six students after a brawl in the
football stands in Decatur, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, however, students are never ``expelled to the
streets,'' said Vallas. Students are enrolled in alternative
schools. For offenses that fall short of expulsion, students are
generally held in school, and put through a rigorous academic and
physical boot-camp, where they are given plenty of bookwork and,
sometimes, required to scrub floors, clean windows and mow grass.
</P>
<P>
   At Curie High School, as in other schools in Chicago, the rules
are made clear to parents and teachers. They are discussed at
assemblies. They are posted on the walls of the school. They are
printed inside a notebook given to each student.
</P>
<P>
   In the detention hall at Curie, the two girls suspended for
fighting in the lunchroom sat quietly, facing the wall, and read
books.
</P>
<P>
   They claimed they had been treated unjustly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just playing,'' said one of the girls. ``We're
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallas said he receives few complaints about the discipline
policy from parents or students. Among the students at Curie High
School, some said they appreciated the strict rules.
</P>
<P>
   Chameka Cole, a 16-year-old junior, said the presence of
security guards makes her feel relaxed enough to concentrate on her
studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel safer at school than I do at home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Salvador Farias, a 17-year-old star football player who
missed a big game for his involvement in a graffiti prank, said the
policies are written by people who have forgotten the ways of young
people.

<P>
   Though much admired, Cole Porter is never mentioned as one of
those innovators who forever changed the content or the direction
of American musical comedy. He is seldom spoken of with the same
reverence with which we talk about Irving Berlin, George and Ira
Gershwin, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, Jerome Kern and Oscar
Hammerstein II, and especially the canonized Rodgers and
Hammerstein.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, who was writing shows from 1916 until 1958 (he died in
1964), had his share of hits, a lot of flops, but only one
generally acknowledged classic, ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' which opened on
Broadway on Dec. 30, 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Yet because he wrote so many songs that became standards (his
flop shows were rich with them), he was never very far from the
public's consciousness. Even today he hangs on, if mostly in hotel
lounges in resort cities and in elevators everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Porter wrote some of the most melodic, unsentimental and
sardonic love songs of the 20th century (``Night and Day,'' ``Just
One of Those Things,'' ``I Get a Kick Out of You,'' among them),
but he is most widely identified with delectable doubles-entendres
in songs that, no matter when they were written, seem to anchor him
forever in the pre-Crash 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   That possibly more than anything else (except that he was born
rich and then married a very rich woman) has always made him
suspect among the more serious critics of theater. He was charming,
which seemed slightly disreputable as the Depression wore on toward
World War II. He was also too much fun, or wanted to be, which was
even more of a burden when he failed to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Look up Harold Clurman's piece about the original ``Kiss Me,
Kate'' cast album, published in The Saturday Review of Literature
in February 1949, in which the usually astute critic calls the
show's style ``unpleasant,'' saying that it ``combines references
to Shakespeare with gangster vulgarity.'' Unpleasant was not a
gutless word in Clurman's vocabulary; it was a grave charge made by
a man who valued manners not as etiquette but as part of the social
contract. Manners are one of the ways by which we protect our
intellectual heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, Clurman pretty much dismissed everything about
the show. However, in a piece about the state of American musical
theater that appeared in The New York Times in 1962, he had
apparently reassessed ``Kiss Me, Kate.'' With an endearing
blitheness that makes no reference to his earlier thoughts about
the show, Clurman notes that the score ``seems to improve with
age.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the director Michael Blakemore's fine, exuberant revival
at the Martin Beck Theater, ``Kiss Me, Kate'' is again revealed to
be what it has always been: an elegant, nimble dream of a show, one
of the rare perfect achievements of the American musical theater.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not get bogged down about what constitutes ``importance''
on the stage or, for that matter, ``seriousness.'' It isn't the
subject matter that defines a show but the quality and truth of
whatever world that is evoked.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' the wit and extreme high spirits of the
music, the lyrics, the choreography and the performances have a way
of deepening our sense of connection to life itself. It is thus an
important, serious show. More relevant: it is grandly entertaining.
In this case it even survives a couple of wrongheaded production
decisions that, if the show were less solidly constructed, might do
fatal harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiss Me, Kate'' has the form of a backstage musical about the
Baltimore tryout of a musical version of ``The Taming of the
Shrew,'' which becomes both an appreciation of ``The Shrew'' and an
appropriation of it. Scenes from the contemporary story, about the
show's battling, egomaniacal co-stars, are interwoven with those
from ``The Shrew'' in such a way that each story carries the other
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, no attempt has been made to update the original Sam and
Bella Spewack book. It is still set in June 1948, three years after
the end of World War II and, though we didn't know it at the time,
two years before the start of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it was a brief, halcyon timeout. By keeping the
1948 period, Blakemore automatically evokes a sense of fable, which
should help literal-minded nerds accept other perfectly harmless
ways in which plausibility is stretched. ``Kiss Me, Kate'' doesn't
intend to be a realistic recollection of what taking a new show on
the road was like 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Neither before nor after did Porter ever write so bountiful a
score nor one so effortlessly integrated. He helps himself to lines
from the play and expands them into songs (``I've Come to Wive It
Wealthily in Padua,'' ``Where Is the Life That Late I Led?,'' ``I
Am Ashamed That Women Are So Simple''). One of his most magical
inspirations is to take a throwaway reference, spoken by Bianca,
give it a mock Shakespearean context and transform it into the
ravishing beguine-tempo love song ``Were Thine That Special Face,''
sung by Petruchio.
</P>
<P>
   There are songs you may well know by heart without being aware
of it: ``Tom, Dick or Harry,'' ``Why Can't You Behave?'' and
``Always True to You (in My Fashion),'' complete with lyrics once
suppressed by radio stations and Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   There are still others, classic but not easily categorized: the
steamy ``Too Darn Hot,'' which opens Act II, and ``Brush Up Your
Shakespeare,'' in which two mobsters instruct the audience in the
practical value of a Shakespearean education.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Stokes Mitchell and Marin Mazzie look gorgeous, sing
rapturously and behave with pricelessly comic self-interest as Fred
Graham and Lilli Vanessi, the acting couple apparently based on
Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne.
</P>
<P>
   Both were most recently seen in ``Ragtime,'' he as Coalhouse
Walker Jr., she as Mother, and both carry on here as if they had
reached a promised land where, at long last, they are allowed to
have a little fun. There is energy and good humor in abundance as
they switch between their roles as the infuriated lovers in
Baltimore and as Petruchio and Katherine in Padua.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Spanger, who plays the standard musical comedy chorine Lois
Lane and, within ``Shrew,'' Bianca, has several of the show's most
enchanting numbers. She has a good voice that includes the sort of
sob that is both funny and sure-fire sweet, but she has not been
helped by either the makeup people or, I assume, the director.
</P>
<P>
   Her red hair is unbecoming, whatever its origin, and her dumb
chorine's locutions fail to amuse at this very late date. Michael
Berresse registers strongly as Bill, Lois' chorus-boy lover, the
guy who can't behave. He is also a dancer who honors the memory of
Harold Lang, who originated the role, and gives Kathleen Marshall's
new choreography its dynamic center.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways in which this production goes awry, quite
radically in fact; though they don't affect the overall quality of
the show, they have a cautionary effect.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Anyone planning this first Broadway revival of ``Kiss Me, Kate''
since the original production must, I realize, have been
hard-pressed to visualize a show that wouldn't look as if it were
also stealing the glorious look of the original.
</P>
<P>
   Lemuel Ayers, the co-producer who also designed the sets and
costumes for the 1948 production, created a show of breathtaking
beauty, of bright, voluptuous Mediterranean blues, lemony yellows
and hot crimsons. It was a world that had the manner of perpetual
carnival, of prancing harlequins and mountebanks, of preening
roosterlike males and demure maidens up to no good, ``dispensing,''
in Porter's words, ``fol-de-rol frivolity.'' The look of the show
provided almost as much of a high as the music and lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is ever going to mistake this new ``Kiss Me, Kate'' for
the original. The shapes and outlines created by Robin Wagner
(scenic design) and Martin Pakledinaz (costume design) are
attractive enough, but the color palette is something else.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a Padua that suggests Pittsburgh before the air was
cleaned up, a world that has the eerie drained-color quality of a
landscape seen during a partial eclipse of the sun. There are no
reds, only rusts, yellows that seem to have faded to cream, blues
that have a hard, metallic surface sheen and pinks that seem to
have gathered dust.
</P>
<P>
   The other mistake: in an apparent effort to jazz up the work of
the Spewacks, someone had the dreadful idea of turning the small
role of Harrison Howell, the stuffy Washington insider with whom
Lilli threatens to elope, into a Gen. Douglas MacArthur type of
Army egotist, complete with corncob pipe. On top of that, the
character, played by Ron Holgate, is given a duet to sing with
Lilli, the song (``From This Moment On'') being one that Porter
originally wrote for ``Out of This World'' (1950).
</P>
<P>
   Putting MacArthur into this show sounds like a late-night
inspiration that should have been thrown out in the morning. It
also focuses unwanted attention on a character whose only reason
for being has to do with the plot. Asking him to sing a song,
which, though great, has no relation to the show, is the stuff of
amateur theatricals. The only people old enough to recognize the
character as MacArthur are likely to find it pointless, while
younger members of the audience will just be baffled.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing ``From This Moment On'' in ``Kiss Me, Kate'' does serve
one purpose, however. Because it obviously has nothing to do with
anything that's going on, it makes you realize how beautifully
integrated the rest of the score is.
</P>
<P>
   George Sidney's 1953 MGM film adaptation of the show used the
same song, but the movie was already such a mess that one song more
or less couldn't make much difference. Among the movie's other
inspirations was to include a character named Cole Porter, played
by Ron Randell, who has all the charm of a vacuum cleaner salesman.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the movie is the Hermes Pan choreography.
This would include the ``From This Moment On'' production number,
which features a very young Bob Fosse doing some of the same steps
and creating the silhouette that would later identify his work on
Broadway. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The one clear impression I brought away from ``Putting It
Together,'' the Stephen Sondheim review (sic) at the Ethel
Barrymore Theater, is of five talented people often doing their
darnedest to look as if they were ad-libbing their material, not an
errant leer or comma of which hadn't been slavishly rehearsed.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad. It's also a surprise considering that the cast,
each member of which plays a generic character, is composed of
Carol Burnett (The Wife), George Hearn (The Husband), John
Barrowman (The Younger Man), Ruthie Henshall (The Younger Woman)
and Bronson Pinchot (The Observer). Casts don't get much better
than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting It Together'' is a quick one-evening overview of more
than three decades of the Sondheim career, mostly of his work as
his own composer and lyricist, but also touching on his
collaborations (``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum''
and ``Do I Hear a Waltz?'').
</P>
<P>
   The shape of the show recapitulates a recurring concern of so
many Sondheim productions in which relationships are in the process
of going sour. Because there is a certain monotony in the material
that has been chosen, based on a certain monotony in the emotions
expressed, the evening itself begins to blur long before it should.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henshall is smashing, especially doing some of the least
often heard Sondheim work, including ``More'' and ``Sooner or
Later'' from ``Dick Tracy.'' Ms. Burnett gets to do the sort of
material that others have already staked claims to, including ``The
Ladies Who Lunch'' and ``Not Getting Married Today,'' both from
``Company.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the men in the cast ever has the opportunity to explode
with quite the same impact. Pinchot, who performs the duties of
host, must speak lines that sound as if they had been written by
someone with one eyebrow arched. They mean to be funnier than they
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting It Together'' has been in the making since 1992, when
it was devised by Sondheim and Julia McKenzie and produced by
Cameron Mackintosh in Oxford, England. Since then, Mackintosh has
produced other versions at the Manhattan Theater Club (1993) and,
last year, at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, which is where
this production originated. Eric D. Schaeffer is the director.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Crowley's unit set, suggesting a city where people are
trapped in tiny mailbox-like enclosures, has a smart, plastic,
urban look to it that is both attractive and chilly. It reflects
the Sondheim material without adding dimension to it.

FTC STAFF SEEKS TO BLOCK BP AMOCO-ARCO MERGER; EXXON-MOBIL UNION
COMPLETED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Alaska, Texas, N.H., Conn.)  (Exclusive) 
(js) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The staff of the Federal Trade Commission has
concluded that the proposed $29 billion merger between BP Amoco and
Atlantic Richfield violates antitrust law and has recommended that
the full commission block the deal, two people who have been
briefed about the decision said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation was based on concerns that the merger could
result in significantly higher gasoline prices in California and
the West. Those states are supplied with crude oil from the North
Slope of Alaska, where exploration and production are dominated by
BP Amoco and ARCO.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the two companies agree to significant new conditions or
divestitures to satisfy the federal government that there would be
enough competition on the West Coast for crude oil, the
recommendation threatens to kill the deal. Last May, when the
agency's staff recommended that it block Barnes &AMP; Noble's $600
million bid for Ingram Book Group, that deal collapsed within three
days.
</P>
<P>
   The BP Amoco-ARCO decision was disclosed the same day that Exxon
and Mobil completed the largest industrial merger in history after
the commission approved that deal and ordered those companies to
sell $2 billion to $3 billion worth of gas stations, pipelines,
terminal ports and a refinery.
</P>
<P>
   While the divestiture is the largest ever ordered by the FTC, it
represents a fraction of the combined companies' assets.
</P>
<P>
   That $81 billion merger combines the nation's two largest oil
companies into a new energy behemoth, which reported a combined
$146 billion in revenue last year, the third largest behind General
Motors and DaimlerChrysler. It also reunites two of the biggest
chunks of the old Standard Oil empire created by John D.
Rockefeller Sr., which was broken up in 1911 for violating federal
antitrust law. (Exxon is the successor of Standard Oil of New
Jersey, while Mobil was once Standard Oil of New York.)
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 4-0, the FTC approved the Exxon-Mobil settlement
Tuesday morning, a day before the first anniversary of the
announcement by the two companies that they planned to merge. Soon
after the vote, executives disclosed that they had formally closed
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of BP Amoco and ARCO, the agency's procedures give
lawyers for the two companies an opportunity to brief the
commission and offer further concessions. A spokesman for BP Amoco
said Tuesday that he expected that the companies and the FTC would
ultimately reach an agreement and that the deal could close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discussions continue with the Federal Trade Commission,'' said
the spokesman, Ronnie Chappell. ``We're confident that we will find
an outcome that's satisfactory to BP Amoco, ARCO and the
commission.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The discussions between government officials and the companies'
antitrust lawyers have centered on the Alaskan market for crude oil
and whether the merger would result in too much concentration for
California and the West. Prices of gasoline in California have been
rising sharply higher than the national average _ 26.3 cents a
gallon higher for regular grade _ and a new study completed last
week by the California attorney general concluded that the relative
lack of competition had been a primary cause of price increases
this year.
</P>
<P>
   A chief problem, the study concluded, was that only six refiners
control more than 90 percent of the capacity in California and also
own the majority of gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   But executives at BP Amoco and ARCO say that there is little
overlap of their operations on the West Coast and that any
concentration of crude oil production in Alaska has been resolved
by a preliminary agreement with the state calling for the companies
to sell 13 percent of their oil production from the North Slope to
other companies. That deal will reduce the combined control of
production to about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Federal and many state officials said Tuesday that they were
confident that the divestitures by Exxon and Mobil would continue
to preserve competition in the oil industry, although the deal will
make it harder for BP Amoco and ARCO to obtain permission for their
merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every deal has to be examined on its own merits,'' Robert
Pitofsky, the chairman of the FTC, said in an interview Tuesday
afternoon. ``But we are quickly approaching the point where given
the trend toward even greater concentration, we are committed to
giving even more scrutiny of the deals that are proposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky declined to discuss the BP Amoco-ARCO merger, which
remains under review, but he said the closing of the Exxon
acquisition was certain to affect other pending deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they certainly have an impact, and I have to be upfront
about that,'' he said. He also said the spate of oil mergers over
the last few years had begun to move the industry ``from moderate
levels of concentration to high levels of concentration'' and that
``we're beginning to approach the limit.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   These are the main assets that Exxon and Mobil agreed to sell
over the next nine to 12 months to gain approval from the federal
government:
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 2,400 gas stations throughout the nation, including
1,740 in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, 360 in California
and 319 in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exxon's Benecia refinery in northern California.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mobil's terminal operations in Boston and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mobil's 11 percent interest in the Colonial pipeline, which
runs from Louisiana to Washington, D.C., and its 3 percent interest
in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.
</P>
<P>
   _ A quantity of paraffinic lubricant base oil, used to help
create many of the world's lubricants, which would be the
equivalent to Mobil's North American market share.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exxon's jet-turbine oil business.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, Exxon-Mobil must also guarantee that
it will supply 100,000 barrels a day of Alaska crude oil to the
Benecia plant to help keep prices competitive in California, said
Bill Lockyer, California's attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer and representatives from 12 other states and Washington,
D.C., joined Tuesday's agreement with the federal government. But
two states, New Hampshire and Connecticut, pointedly did not agree
to the terms of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This huge combination may harm consumers, hamstring
competition and threaten dealers,'' said Richard Blumenthal, the
Connecticut attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said that Connecticut could not block the merger but
remained deeply concerned about the treatment of hundreds of gas
station owners and operators who may now have to give up their
stations as part of the divestiture or who could be forced into
onerous new station leasing and gasoline pricing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon and Mobil have been conducting bids for the stations but
have not said what will happen to the existing dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement announced Tuesday, the FTC has the
authority to approve or veto all the purchasers of the stations.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said that Blumenthal ``was absolutely right'' to be
concerned about the fate of the owners and operators of the
stations, and that the commission would closely examine the
business plans of all prospective buyers to see how they treated
the dealers. &QL;

 &HT;    MASS GRAVES LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS STUN MEXICO, RELATIVES OF
MISSING
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS and DAVE HARMON 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico _ It's a chilling sign that greets
visitors to this desert ranch where U.S. and Mexican authorities
suspect drug traffickers tortured, executed and buried victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hidden Treasure Field,'' the billboard advertises cheerfully,
right next to a shooting range and horse ranch that could contain
the remains of dozens of people killed by drug traffickers in this
tough city on the northern Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday _ in an unusually cooperative binational operation _
about 65 agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation joined
Mexican authorities in an effort to find the dead by painstakingly
excavating the ranch near Ciudad Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a tip from an informer arrested in El Paso, Texas,
investigators began searching Monday on the ranch and three other
sites in this area. They are reportedly looking for the remains of
some 100 people who have disappeared from Juarez and El Paso, just
across the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of missing persons in this area say a total of at
least 208 people have vanished or been kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez, a gritty factory town drenched in dust and heat, has
been gripped by a series of killings of women factory workers as
well as internecine warfare among drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 22 Americans could be among bodies reportedly buried
in clandestine graves outside Juarez, a smuggling haven,
authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe these people were killed for their knowledge or for
being witnesses to drug trafficking endeavors,'' Assistant FBI
Director Thomas Pickard said in Washington on Tuesday. ``Most of
the information we have shows these individuals were buried there
at least two to three years ago, so it's not a recent situation.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said of the grisly find, ``It's a horrible
example, apparently, of excesses of the drug dealing cartels in
Mexico. And I think it reinforces the imperative of our not only
trying to protect our border but to work with the Mexican
authorities to try to combat these (traffickers).''
</P>
<P>
   At the deserted ranch, investigators had a backhoe delivered on
Tuesday and they clustered around a cement barn next to some empty
horse stables. Mexican Army troops and masked Mexican federal
police guarded the ranch, situated along a main highway about three
miles outside Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities appeared to be surveying the property and at least
one trained dog roamed the site. None of the officials inside the
gated ranch would speak to reporters, but at a press conference in
El Paso, Mexican and U.S. officials said they said didn't yet have
a firm idea of how many bodies _ if any _ were buried at the sites
identified by the informant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found some remains,'' said Jose Larrieta Carrasco, the
head of the Mexican Attorney General's organized crime unit, who
was in El Paso. ``They could be human remains.''
</P>
<P>
   Larrieta Carrasco declined to reveal the other places where
authorities are looking for bodies, using sophisticated forensic
techniques like those employed to unearth victims of ethnic
cleansing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   David Alba, special agent-in-charge of the El Paso FBI office
said the 65 FBI employees are working with Mexican officials in two
different groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Mexican investigation,'' Alba said. He also said
that investigators are not searching for missing Drug Enforcement
Administration or FBI agents, as was initially reported in some
news accounts.
</P>
<P>
   News of the possible mass graves quickly spread among the
families of people said to have disappeared in Juarez and El Paso
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   At the ranch, Ramon Alonso clutched a copy of a local newspaper
story about his brother, Jose Alonso, missing for nearly two years.
He finally pushed it through the white and gold-painted gates
surrounding the ranch in an attempt to get officials to listen to
his story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been so much impunity in Juarez, nobody pays attention
to us,'' Ramon said, describing how his brother, a Juarez mechanic,
went off with two men to do a job for them and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   Alonso said the men that he believes abducted his brother were
dressed like plain-clothed police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably missing from the search for bodies are local Juarez
police and Chihuahua state judicial police. Local authorities were
apparently left in the dark about the operation, which Mexican
Attorney General Jorge Madrazo described as part of a growing
relationship between Mexican authorities and the FBI to solve the
many disappearances in this border region.
</P>
<P>
   The Juarez police have often been linked to drug traffickers,
including the notorious Juarez cartel, which used to be one of
Mexico's most powerful smuggling rings. The cartel began to
splinter after its leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes died during
plastic surgery and liposuction in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez was hit with a barrage of gunfights and killings as
traffickers fought for control of the lucrative market. If bodies
are found in the excavations, some may be those of people murdered
in such feuds.
</P>
<P>
   But others may belong to police informants or aides, or to other
innocent people who have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Full excavation and identification of any remains found may take
weeks or months to complete.
</P>
<P>
   In El Paso, Jaime Hervella , the president of a group
representing the families of people who have disappeared, said the
FBI has called at least two families asking them to provide dental
records of their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mix of emotions,'' he said ``I think (the families) are
in a position like me, not knowing how to react.''
</P>
<P>
   Hervella said they have spent two and a half years badgering
Mexican authorities to investigate the disappearances, but their
pleas fell on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   Hervella formed the group, called the Association of Relatives
and Friends of Missing Persons, in 1997, three years after his
godson, Saul Sanchez Jr., disappeared along with his wife in
Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who disappeared were working with Mexican or
American Police, Hervella said. Sanchez designed and sold
sophisticated listening devices to Mexican police. One of the
devices helped them seize a large load of narcotics, Hervella said.
</P>
<P>
   In Albuquerque, N.M., Leandra Pfieffer set out Tuesday for El
Paso, hoping to learn the fate of her son Ricardo Pfieffer, a
35-year-old realtor who was abducted at gunpoint from his Juarez
home in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Leandra Pfieffer said the kidnappers called her demanding
$250,000 ransom, and threatening to deliver her son in pieces if
the family did not pay.
</P>
<P>
   She said they did not have the money. They have not heard from
the kidnappers or her son since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they killed him, or he would have called me,'' she
said, ``I haven't slept, just thinking, 'Is my son there?'''

WTO VIOLENCE PUTS ANARCHISTS IN SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (In graph 10, corrects name to Industrial Workers of the World)  
 By RUTH TIECHROEB  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Anarchists represented a tiny fraction of thousands of
mostly peaceful protesters in Seattle Tuesday, but their violent
tactics put them on center stage as they rampaged through downtown,
smashing store windows with hammers, spray-painting buildings and
slashing tires.
</P>
<P>
   The self-proclaimed anarchists appeared to be mostly teenagers
and twentysomethings who donned black ski masks and black clothes
sporting an anarchist symbol of the letter ``A'' in a circle.
</P>
<P>
   The circled ``A'' is one of the most familiar symbols of
anarchism and represents the slogan ``Anarchy is Order''. Other
symbols of anarchy include a black flag and a red-and-black flag.
</P>
<P>
   A 28-year-old Oregon protester who identified himself only as
``Smoke'' said the rampage was justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of property is violent,'' said the man, wearing a
black army helmet with the circled ``A'' symbol. ``Some people are
focusing their energy on the WTO instead of capitalism in general.
Even if we stop the WTO here, we're not stopping capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   He called nonviolent protesters ``peace police'' and accused
them of ``pushing their views on some of us who are more radical.''
</P>
<P>
   Another protester, who said he is 24 but would not give his
name, said that the real violence was being perpetrated by
corporations and governments against the world's natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Police Chief Norm Stamper said at a news conference
Tuesday afternoon that a small number of protesters were causing
the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wild card, if you will, is that we have protestors from
all over the world in Seattle,'' Stamper said, referring to the
anarchists.
</P>
<P>
   The anarchist movement represents a range of groups, from
organized and primarily nonviolent groups like the Industrial
Workers of the World to loosely-knit and more extremist splinter
groups such as the Eugene, Ore.-based Black Army Faction.
</P>
<P>
   Members of IWW, usually called Wobblies, were pivotal in the
Seattle General Strike in February 1919 when 60,000 workers stayed
home, shutting down the city.
</P>
<P>
   Anarchist thought, which dates back at least to the 18th
century, supports resistance to the state and capitalism, and
encompasses a broad, and often vague, political platform.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, anarchist philosophy has been linked to Marxism,
some forms of trade unionism and international conflicts like the
Spanish and Russian civil wars.
</P>
<P>
   During the last decade, the small but growing U.S. movement has
tackled new enemies like technology and world trade.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the younger generation of anarchists believe in using
extreme measures, including violence against property, to achieve
their goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying, ``Enough is enough'' _ we don't have time to
change things nonviolently,'' said Smoke.
</P>
<P>
   A 17-year-old protester called ``Rain'' said protests in the
1960s failed to overthrow the government because ``they were
passive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rain said concerns run the gamut from excessive consumerism,
environmental issues to general urban despair of poverty and
homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   She also said spray-painting and property damage are effective
tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun and it gets people's attention,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An 18-year-old Seattle man, who identified himself as ``Meth'',
said he had participated in spray-painting anarchy symbols on
downtown jewelry stores and other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is greed,'' the man said. ``Where else would an anarchy
symbol belong.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, anarchists in Eugene have vandalized a
police van, writing ``Die Pig'' across the back window, and
launched attacks against local computer software and Nike outlets.
A radical anarchist faction also claimed responsibility for an
arson fire that burned down a Eugene meat-packing plant last May.

   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico _ U.S. and Mexican law enforcement
officials searching the grounds at a farm outside this city on the
Texas border Tuesday discovered some remains that could be human,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The search party is looking for the bodies of more than 100
Mexican and U.S. citizens who have disappeared. They are looking
here and at three other sites in Chihuahua state. Most of the
missing people had some tie, even if peripheral, to the drug trade
before their disappearance, say government authorities, and it is
presumed that most were ordered executed by traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of FBI forensic experts were working with a backhoe and
radar equipment at a farmsite on the southern outskirts of Juarez,
with Mexican federal police and uniformed Mexican army infantrymen
guarding the walled perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Other FBI agents were working at the other sites, in Chihuahua
state, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The search for bodies began Monday, after an informer led the
FBI to the site. The operation is one of the largest joint law
enforcement operations undertaken by the two countries in recent
years. Its intensity and scope suggests that officials believe they
have firm leads that could begin to resolve the mystery surrounding
scores of people who have disappeared in the past several years.
But so far, authorities said, they have not found any intact
cadavers.
</P>
<P>
   The joint operation was confirmed Tuesday by Attorney General
Jorge Madrazo in Mexico City and FBI Director Louis Freeh in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Larrieta Carrasco, director of Mexico's Unit for Combating
Organized Crime, said in a news conference in El Paso, Texas, that
some of the remains uncovered may be human and were being analyzed.
He expressed confidence that the search could bear results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very concrete information about these sites,''
Larrieta said.
</P>
<P>
   David Alba, the special agent in charge of the FBI's El Paso
office, who appeared before reporters with Larrieta, said that 65
FBI agents were taking part in the search at the several Chihuahua
sites. The FBI has established a command post in El Paso where it
will bring the remains for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials have developed extensive files on at least 100
people who have disappeared in and around Juarez. The Association
of Relatives and Friends of Disappeared Persons, based in El Paso,
has compiled a list of 196 people who have disappeared, most from
Juarez, and the Juarez newspaper Norte has a list of 120 vanished
people. The missing include 22 Americans, officials from both
nations said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the missing have disappeared after detention by
Mexican federal or Chihuahua state police. Evidence compiled by the
association suggests that in some cases the victims were arrested
and killed by Mexican police or soldiers, hired by traffickers to
eliminate a rival or punish a debtor. In other cases, the victims
appear to have vanished when they were detained for questioning by
Mexican narcotics agents.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez, which forms a single metropolitan area with El Paso, is
the center of operations for one of Mexico's largest cocaine and
marijuana smuggling organizations, known as the Juarez cartel.

<P>
   Authorities were led to the Juarez ranch and the other Chihuahua
sites by an informant whom the FBI debriefed early this year,
according to a law enforcement official in Washington cited by the
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have exchanged intelligence information and witness
testimony, and finally, with some statements we received recently
and some very intense analysis work that we've done both in Mexico
and in El Paso, Texas, we decided to carry out this operation in
four points of Chihuahua,'' said Madrazo, on Tuesday in an
interview broadcast in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI forensic agents arrived at the Juarez farmstead Tuesday
morning in a convoy of 16 vehicles, including several Chevrolet
Suburbans, a Ryder panel truck, a tractor trailer loaded with the
backhoe, and a Winnebago recreational vehicle apparently used as a
temporary office. The farm is located about two miles south and
west of the Juarez airport, on the side of a highway lined with
junkyards.
</P>
<P>
   Passing through a steel gate, the U.S. agents drove down a
gravel lane to a cluster of buildings including what appears to be
a grainary and a stable, set alongside a white-fenced corral. The
agents parked the backhoe, and later operated it, in a narrow space
between the grainary and the cinderblock wall, topped with
concertina wire, that surrounds the compound. The property is the
size of several football fields.
</P>
<P>
   Six members of a Mexican family that lived at the site,
apparently as caretakers, were being held by Mexican federal police
in a cottage at the front of the property.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer who identified himself as a representative of the
property owner visited the farm buildings Tuesday and told
reporters he was trying to obtain the family's release.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion that mass graves may be discovered provoked
anxiety in the cramped El Paso office of the Association, which has
been pressing authorities on both sides of the border for three
years to determine the whereabouts of the disappeared. The group's
co-director, Jaime Hervella, is an accountant whose godson has been
missing since 1994, along with the godson's wife.
</P>
<P>
   The couple vanished the night they were to attend a play at a
Juarez theater. Hervella helped found the Association after growing
frustrated with government apathy over his godson's case.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the association's members learned of its work through a
classified ad that Hervella placed in El Paso and Juarez papers in
1997. Hervella said most of the missing were people caught up with
the Mexican drug cartels, but he said he believed many innocent
people also were abducted.
</P>
<P>
   Since the association began to press for an official accounting,
the Mexican government has appointed five consecutive special
prosecutors to investigate. The first was fired when he did not
aggressively carry out an investigation in Juarez. The second was
sacked after his investigative unit was infiltrated by traffickers.
The last prosecutor, Enrique Cocina Perez, vacated his offices in
Juarez in October without public explanation, puzzling association
members.
</P>
<P>
   In his accounting office Tuesday, besieged by reporters,
Hervella met with a man who arrived carrying a homemade missing
poster of his son, Victor Hugo Ontiveros Gomez, who disappeared in
Juarez several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in and said, `I have given this information to the FBI
_ and I hope in my heart that they will not find my son's body,'''
Hervella said, quoting Ontiveros.
</P>
<P>
   In his efforts to prod the authorities, Hervella said he has
always assumed that the missing were locked up in Mexican prisons,
not dead. He said the suggestion that they may turn up in mass
graves had provoked ``tremendous confusion in my own feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   The news reverberated to family members and friends of missing
people from the region. Leandra Pfieffer left her Albuquerque, in
New Mexico, home at 8 a.m. Tuesday, driving across the border to
the farmstead on Juarez's southern outskirts to watch the search
operation. Reached en route on her cell phone, Mrs. Pfieffer said
her son, Ricardo, an El Paso real estate agent, was abducted at his
home in August 1996. She said two people who organized her son's
kidnapping have been convicted of the crime in a U.S. trial, but
his body has yet to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Castano, an El Paso resident whose brother disappeared in
Juarez in June 1996, complained Tuesday that no official from
either government has been helpful in pursuing his brother's
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Castano said he was ``almost certain'' that his brother's
remains would now be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why, he said, ``Because it is just too coincidental _
almost exact amount of persons missing and almost exact amount of
persons buried at those sites,'' at least according to early
speculation.

BUSH TO OUTLINE $483 BILLION TAX-CUTTING PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: 3 a.m. EST embargo for all media) 
 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ George W. Bush hopes that the $483 billion
tax-cutting plan he unveils Wednesday will keep the nation
prosperous and avoid the kind of economic downturn that contributed
to his father's 1992 re-election defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan, according to an aide who briefed Texas newspaper
reporters, includes a combination of expanded tax deductions and
lowered marginal tax rates that are intended to favorably affect
low-income and wealthy individuals, as well as two-income families.
</P>
<P>
   ``My tax-cut plan is not just about productivity, it's about
people,'' the Republican presidential front-runner said in a
statement released by his campaign. ``It will make life better for
average men, women and children.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor will deliver a speech outlining his tax-cut
plan Wednesday in Des Moines, Iowa, one day before his first debate
with his rivals for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But promising tax cuts is not as popular as it once was, as
congressional Republicans discovered when they devoted much of the
summer unsuccessfully trying to sell voters on a $792 billion
tax-cut package.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan warned
congressional Republicans in July that they should hold off on tax
cuts because the cuts might be needed later to jump-start a sagging
economy.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton vetoed the $792 billion Republican-backed
tax cut in September, Bush said he would have signed the plan
because it would have been good for individuals and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush admitted in a recent interview he worries that the economy
might suffer a cyclical downturn after he takes office as
president, creating the appearance of a second Bush Bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be one of the great ironies, wouldn't it? I'm not an
alarmist. You shouldn't read into the words any sense of panic or
concern, but it's important,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the reasons I've advocated cutting the marginal
rates of taxes, as an insurance policy against an economic
downturn. I certainly hope the economy doesn't turn down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan would reduce federal revenues by $483 billion over
the next five years, the aide said, and is based on a
``conservative'' estimated revenue growth rate of 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The key elements of the plan include reducing the federal
marginal tax rates by reducing the number of tax brackets from five
to four and cutting the range of rates from the current 15 percent
to 39.6 percent to a new range of 10 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also would double tax credits from $500 to $1,000 per
child; create a 10 percent deduction for two-income families to
lessen the marriage penalty; eliminate estate taxes; make the
research and development tax credit permanent; allow non-itemizing
taxpayers to deduct charitable contributions; and eliminate the
Social Security earnings limit for seniors between the ages of 65
and 69.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan also would expand the Education Savings Account
program beyond the current tax-free savings for college. The amount
that could go into the account would be raised from $500 to $5,000
a year per child, and the money could be spent tax-free on tuition
and books for private and parochial schools from kindergarten
through 12th grade.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton made the economy, which took a slide in the early
1990s, a driving element of the successful campaign he waged to
deny President Bush a second term in 1992. The campaign's internal
slogan was: ``It's the Economy, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he worries that the nation's current boom economy
might not be sustainable over the next several years without the
kind of boost that a tax cut would bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the growth has been balance-sheet growth, stock
markets. We've been able to refinance our homes, interest rates
dropping. But there's beginning to be some pressure on interest
rates,'' said Bush, adding that there also is inflationary pressure
because of tightening labor markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way to insure against a downturn is to put more money into
the pockets of consumers. And one way (to do that) is to cut
marginal rates,'' Bush said. ``Remember any plan I propose today
won't be in effect until a couple of years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   The unsuccessful congressional plan had some of the same
elements as Bush's proposal, including reduction in marginal rates,
the elimination of estate taxes and reduction in taxes for some
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan does not include a cut in the capital gains tax
rate, which is favored by businesses but easily portrayed by
Democrats as a benefit for the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won the public relations battle by portraying the GOP
tax plan as fiscally irresponsible, one that would increase the
national debt and cause cuts in needed federal programs. The
president had proposed a tax cut of about $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showed that voters were more interested in reducing the
national debt and saving Social Security and Medicare than getting
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In an Associated Press poll released Tuesday, only eight percent
of those surveyed said taxes would be the most important issue in
deciding whom to vote for in the 2000 election. The poll of 1,023
adults found that among voters' priorities taxes ranked behind
education, Social Security, Medicare, the economy, the nation's
moral values, and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent poll by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP;
the Press found that only staunch conservatives believed that taxes
should be a high priority for the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may have been thinking of those conservatives, who play a
pivotal role in the GOP primaries, particularly in states such as
New Hampshire, where Bush is in a tight race with Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   While taking questions from New Hampshire voters last week, Bush
said he wanted to make certain his proposed cut in tax rates would
benefit low-income individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marginal rate, if you are near poverty and you're headed
to the middle class, say you are a single mom with children ... as
you head into the 15 percent bracket and the earned income tax
credit drops off, you pay a high marginal rate on taxes,'' Bush
said. ``And that's not right. That's unfair in the tax code. That
needs to be adjusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's plan, the aide briefing Texas reporters said, a
family of four earning $35,000 a year would pay no income taxes
because of the adjustments to rates and the increased child tax
credits. A family of four earning $50,000 a year would save $1,900
a year on taxes, while a family of four earning $75,000 a year
would save $2,500 in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan also would have a benefit for the nation's
wealthiest people.
</P>
<P>
   Income of $130,250 to $283,250 is taxed at a rate of 36 percent
and income above that level is taxed at a rate of 39.6 percent.
Under Bush's plan, income of $130,250 and above would be taxed at
the lower rate of 33 percent. That means an individual earning
$500,000 a year could save more than $18,800 in federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The overall size of Bush's tax proposal has been limited by the
spending plans made by Congress and the Clinton administration,
which use much of the budget surplus for the next several years. It
also will be limited by Bush's promise that all payroll taxes for
Social Security will be ``lock-boxed,'' meaning his administration
will not borrow from the Social Security trust fund to finance
deficit spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has promised there will be no cuts in Social Security
benefits for the elderly, but he is promoting individual retirement
savings accounts for younger people as a supplement to the Social
Security system.

CONTROVERSY GROWS OVER `LOST' HANCOCK CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Working-class people with modest burial policies and
Stephen L. Brown, the multimillionaire chairman and chief executive
of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., have something in
common: Both have been ``lost'' in the big company's databases.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a growing controversy about the Boston insurer's failure to
locate scores of missing customers, nearly a million policyholders
gave an expected nod Tuesday to Hancock's plan to go public. The
approval puts Hancock on track to conduct an anticipated initial
public offering on Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, in a personal note to the lost-customers flap, said
Tuesday after the tally that he, too, had turned up missing. But he
blamed himself, not the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a John Hancock customer, I myself am guilty of losing track
of a life insurance policy and of allowing John Hancock to lose
track of me,'' Brown told a policyholder meeting in Boston. ``It
wasn't until demutualization packets were mailed out that I
remembered an old policy whose address I had never updated.''
</P>
<P>
   About 94 percent of 1 million policyholders who cast votes were
in favor of Hancock's plan to become one of the insurance world's
largest publicly held companies, a process known as
demutualization. Policyholders, who are technically the owners of a
mutual, will receive stock in the new company, cash, or beefier
policies in exchange for their ownership rights.
</P>
<P>
   Barely one in three of the 2.8 million policyholders who were
eligible to vote cast ballots. Most of the 400,000 policyholders
that Hancock has lost track of _ nearly 15 percent of its eligible
customer base _ were entitled to vote on the plan. About 300
policyholders turned out Tuesday to ask Hancock executives about
the conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Most insurers lose track of 3 to 5 percent of their customers,
according to consumer advocate and Boston lawyer Jason Adkins.
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. of New York, which is also
demutualizing, lost track of 600,000 of its 11.1 million total
policyholders. Hancock originally could not find a whopping 25
percent of 2.8 million policyholders, or 800,000 customers, who
were eligible to vote on the company's conversion. The insurer has
a total 3.3 million policyholders. After $4 million and 18 months
of searching, Hancock is still looking for 400,000 customers,
typically older people with burial policies worth less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock has blamed its missing-persons problem on people who
move without leaving forwarding addresses. Many policies were sold
by door-to-door agents decades ago, before easily traceable Social
Security numbers were used on documents. Critics have countered
that Hancock has a fiduciary responsibility to keep track of its
customers, for whom life insurance can be their most valuable
investment. Annual mailings to policyholders who had moved would
have been returned, which should have prompted the insurer to
launch a search years ago, Adkins said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have also slammed Hancock. Secretary of State
William Galvin said Tuesday that he was disturbed by the company's
inability to find missing clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about pursuing missing people,'' said
Galvin, who as the state's top securities overseer has some
regulatory authority over Hancock. ``I'm less than clear as to what
the company is saying it is going to do about this, and I'm looking
for a written commitment from them'' that missing customers will
receive compensation should they show up later.''

NASA CONTROLLERS NUDGE MARS ORBITER CLOSER TO LANDING SITE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub to fix lede to ``Lander'') 
 
By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Flight controllers fine-tuned the trajectory
of NASA's Mars Polar Lander on Tuesday, nudging the small probe
closer to its intended landing site at the barren planet's south
pole.
</P>
<P>
   The small spacecraft is scheduled to touch down at 3:01 p.m. EST
Friday following a 5 1/2-minute, high-velocity plunge into the thin
Martian atmosphere and an 11-month journey from Earth. The probe
was designed to slow to a landing on the northern fringes of the
planet's south pole, slowed by a single parachute and the pulsing
of small braking thrusters.
</P>
<P>
   If the probe reaches the surface safely, scientists plan to use
a 6.5-foot long robot arm on the spacecraft and other instruments
to dig for evidence of frozen water in the subsoil. Scientists
believe the south pole may contain a reservoir of frozen water,
which once flowed over the now arid surface before Mars underwent a
change in climate.
</P>
<P>
   As the spacecraft sped within 780,000 miles of the Red Planet on
Tuesday, ground control teams at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
altered the spacecraft's 12,000 mph velocity by 1 mph, with a
12.6-second long maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly small change in velocity could make a big
difference as the Polar Lander reaches Mars on Friday. If it
arrives with an overly steep trajectory, the spacecraft could
descend too quickly and crash.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fifth such maneuver since the Polar Lander was
launched Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Though evaluations of the maneuver's accuracy will continue
until Friday, mission managers were confident that the Mars Polar
Lander is on course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current estimate of the flight path shows us right on
target,'' said NASA's Sam Thurman, the Mars Polar Lander flight
operations manager.
</P>
<P>
   Navigation and operations teams have been working around the
clock since the Thanksgiving holiday to ensure their calculations
are correct.
</P>
<P>
   A companion spacecraft, NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter, was lost
Sept. 23, just as it was maneuvering into orbit around the planet
following a near 10-month transit from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The mishap was blamed on navigational errors later attributed to
a mixup between NASA and its contractor, Lockheed Martin, over the
use of metric and English unit of force for navigational maneuvers.
Though the space agency found no similar mixup with the Polar
Lander probe, it has added experts and checked and rechecked its
calculations of the spacecraft's trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   The task of landing on Mars is even more daunting.
</P>
<P>
   In order to land on the site selected by scientists in August,
the Polar Lander must hit an imaginary elliptical ``bulls eye''
about 80 miles above the Martian atmosphere. About 25 miles long
and 6.2 miles wide, the bulls eye represents the opening for an
imaginary corridor that will whisk the probe through the atmosphere
to the Martian surface.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's maneuver nudged the probe closer to the center of the
bulls eye. With the intense tracking and constant re-evaluations
under way, flight controllers will have an opportunity for a final
maneuver Friday, 6 1/2 hours before the landing, if they find
dispersions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to emphasize this is a very complex task we're going to
undertake,'' NASA's John McNamee, the Mars Polar Lander project
development manager, said. ``Landing on the surface of another
planet is a very difficult thing to do.''

under way, flight controllers will have an opportunity for a final
maneuver Friday, 6 1/2 hours before the landing, if they find
dispersions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to emphasize this is a very complex task we're going to
undertake,'' NASA's John McNamee, the Mars Polar Lander project
development manager, said. ``Landing on the surface of another
planet is a very difficult thing to do.''

PROTESTERS, SEATTLE POLICE CLASH; TRADE TALKS DELAYED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEATTLE _ In a day split by peaceful protests and angry
activism, police in full riot gear Tuesday fired tear gas into the
crowds of demonstrators who filled downtown Seattle, and shut down
the latest round of world trade talks, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   As 20,000 or more union workers from around the country prepared
for a massive afternoon march on the city, thousands of other
protests locked arms to form human chains, sat down in the streets,
and surged against police barricades to keep World Trade
Organization delegates from reaching their meetings. The WTO
conference is intended to be a starting point for a new round of
negotiations on ways to liberalize trade; WTO members this week are
trying to set an agenda for further discussions.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the singing and sloganeering, ugliness erupted
repeatedly throughout the day, and by late afternoon several street
corners were in chaos. To force the protesters to disperse, a 7
p.m. curfew was imposed in the downtown area, a state of emergency
was declared, and the National Guard was called out.
</P>
<P>
   Face to face with police determined to hold the line, protesters
set a dumpster on fire at one intersection, spraypainted a squad
car at another, and hurled insults and objects at officers at both
locations. Standing beside an armor personnel carrier, and backup
vehicles, police in gas masks and holding plastic shields responded
again and again with tear gas, pepper spray and what were believed
to be rubber bullets. They did not move toward the crowds, and,
instead, appeared almost relaxed as white clouds of gas rose from
the ground and spread throughout through the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth it,'' said Isaac Rojas, a 29-year-old lawyer and
environmental activist from Costa Rica, said between fits of
coughing caused by an early volley of gas. ``We did what we wanted,
we got a chance to confront the delegates directly. We got our
message heard, although this is just the beginning of our work.''
</P>
<P>
   With the heart of the city paralyzed from dawn past dusk, at
least two dozen people were arrested and a half dozen injured,
police said. Her eyes red, her body limp, one woman hit by pepper
spray had to be carried to safety as people shouted, ``Stay calm,
no stampeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Some WTO delegates criticized the city's handling of what
everyone expected to be the largest protest effort in recent
history, one bringing together people from different nations and
with different concerns but all of them opposing the Geneva-based
trade group as a secretive, undemocratic organization that favors
trade over everything from human rights to animal rights to labor
rights.
</P>
<P>
   But WTO Director-General Michael Moore stressed that overall
ceremonies were cancelled, a working lunch was held as scheduled,
negotiations were ``in full swing'' and other meetings were
continuing uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has not stopped our work,'' he said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, however, did agree with many of the peaceful protesters,
who were in the clear majority and who expressed disgust at the
lawlessness that broke out at what had been billed as a non-violent
protest.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, a small band of teenagers and young adults,
dressed in black, their faces covered with bandannas, went on a
rampage, smashing store windows with crowbars, overturning trash
cans, and vandalizing cars for nearly an hour. Authorities used a
bulldozer to prevent large barrels from being rolled down one
street. The trouble-makers tended not to be affiliated with any of
the human rights, environmental, labor, or members of other
organizations who were taking part in demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day ministerial conference, where President Clinton is
scheduled to speak Wednesday, runs through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful the hoodlums would tarnish the other gatherers' message,
some protesters stepped in to try to stop the trouble themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain point where actions like this should be
taken, but this is rash,'' said Greg Dean, 29, a Seattle carpenter,
as he watched somone spray-paint graffiti on the wheels of a police
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people feel tied down, sometimes they have to break out
and vandalism and violence happens. I'd rather have seen this stay
peaceful today.''
</P>
<P>
   But with an hour to go until curfew, the crowds refused to back
down as poice issued five-minute warnings and more canisters of gas
and spray were tossed their way. As they had throughout the day,
demonstrators struggled to keep their faces covered with sweatshirt
hoods and scarves.
</P>
<P>
   An eerie quiet settled in on some street corners, with only
occasional chants of ``the world is watching,'' but people made no
move to leave. In response, police reinforcements carrying batons
and other anti-riot equipment arrived by the score and, four and
five deep, faced off for more confrontation. Loud booms and the
sound of sirens filled the air. One man, his bloody head bandaged,
said he believed he had been hit by a rubber bullet after hearing
the crack and seeing a flash. The ground was littered with tiny
black rubber projectiles.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the protest marches of all sizes that passed
through downtown starting at 7 a.m. and lasting well into the
afternoon, sometimes causing bottlenecks at intersections and often
paralyzing traffic, came and went without incident.
</P>
<P>
   Every organization, every cause, appeared to be represented,
many of them having no obvious ties to the events centered around
the WTO and its right to settle trade disputes among its 135 member
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Banners flew for the Freedom Socialist Party, the Communist
Party, and Veterans for Peace. A group calling itself ``Radical
Women'' was represented, as was the Free Mumia Movement, the
coalition that supports the release of a Philadelphia man convicted
of killing a police officer years ago. Other groups supported a
free Taiwan and free trade with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But it was international trade and its impact on US workers that
was intended as the theme of the day until violence broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Teamsters International president James Hoffa Jr. and
trade unionists on Harley motorcycles, tens of thousands of union
members _ machinists, school teachers, dock workers, steel workers,
and electrical workers, among others _ rallied at Seattle's Sports
Stadium, then filed into downtown in an hourslong procession that
extended for block after block. Planned with city officials and
police, with hundreds of union-appointed marshalls in orange caps
keeping order, the march was a sharp contrast to the activities
that greeted the men and women as they headed toward the convention
center, where many of the WTO meetings are supposed to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal was to draw attention to the loss of American jobs to
overseas workers who earn far less money and sometimes work in
conditions below US standards. One of the few floats featured in
the procession was built in recent days by unionized General
Electric workers from Lynn, Mass., who paid their own way to
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could give you propaganda and say, `Yeah, this is it,
this is the turning point for us,' '' said Edward Fire, president
of the International Union of Electrical Workers and chairman of
the coordinated bargaining committee for the 14 unions that
represent GE plants. ``The whole question of better deals for
workers has come into the forefront in the last couple years. This
is just another step in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the peaceful protesters and union members alike worried
late Tuesday that the world would remember only the anger here,
much of it directed at police rather than the WTO. As one young man
scaled a streetlight to replace a banner welcoming the WTO with one
condemning the trade group, a sometimes forest-firefighter named
Jeremy Plotkin from British Columbia wished aloud that everyone had
attended a three-hour class in non-violence training, as he had.
Within hours, police would be ordered to clear out Seattle's
downtown, although no one was sure how to accomplish that without
incurring more violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO goes against all my core beliefs, and I think we're
sending a strong message that we're fed up,'' said Plotkin, 24, who
is active in environmental causes. ``But right now I'm worried
about what message these other people are sending. Maybe 1 percent
of the people out here are doing damage, but it's damaging all of
us.''

BRADLEY CONTINUES ASSAULT ON GORE HEALTH CARE PROPOSALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Going on the offensive against Vice President
Gore for a second straight day, Democratic presidential contender
Bill Bradley Tuesday sharply criticized Gore's health &UR;  &LR; care
proposals, saying Gore is content to ``take a broken system and
throw money at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to about 160 people who packed an auditorium at the
University of New Hampshire, Bradley charged that Gore has spoken
grandly of his ambitions for health care reform but is proposing
only small, symbolic improvements in the system. The vice
president's narrow-gauge approach epitomizes why so many voters
have lost faith in political leaders, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big rhetoric followed by small actions contributes to people's
cyncicism about politics,'' Bradley said. ``We live in a time of
unparalleled prosperity. We should fix our roof when the sun is
shining. We should do something big'' to provide health care for
millions who lack it.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, also campaigning in New Hampshire, shot back
with its view that Bradley's health care plan is irresponsibly
spendthrift and would theaten the economy. Gore press secretary
Chris Lehane charged that Bradley was going over to the attack
because he ``is increasingly becoming a desperate polician.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming a day after Bradley ripped into Clinton-Gore foreign
policy in Russia and the Balkans, Tuesday's back-and-forth
represented a further sharpening and deepening of differences
between the two Democratic contenders, a phenomenon many campaign
workers say is happening much earlier than they expected. New
Hampshire's first-in-the-nation presidential primary is Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley was attacking Gore on health care in Manchester,
the vice president was in Bedford, telling a group of about 200
business people that he knows how to keep the economy going strong.
Over a bacon and eggs breakfast, Gore said the policy proposals of
Bradley and all the Republican candidates for president would harm
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will pledge to you, if you elect me president, I will
balance the budget and better every single year,'' Gore said,
vowing also to reduce the national debt during each year of a Gore
presidency in order to keep interest rates low.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore frequently reminds voters about economic growth in
New England during the Clinton administration, it is usually an
aside, rather than his main focus. This time, aligning himself with
the president, Gore took credit for the nation's economic
turnaround, saying the administration has gotten the fundamentals
right, while his opponents have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single one of the Republican candidates for president
has endorsed a truly reckless tax scheme that would immediately put
our country right back into deficits,'' Gore said. ``Senator
Bradley, by contrast, in his very first campaign proposal proposes
a health care scheme that would give two-thirds of the money to
people who already have insurance, many of them wealthy, and spend
the entire budget surplus for the next ten years, also putting us
immediately right back into deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley made his remarks before a crowd of about 300 students
and faculty who received him warmly at Keene State College. The
candidate delivered the best performance of his two-day New England
swing, frequently getting laughs and applause for folksy jokes and
family stories.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Downtown Seattle was placed under curfew, and the
National Guard was called in Tuesday after sometimes violent
protests by thousands of people forced a postponement of the
opening of a major international trade conference.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disorders, President Clinton was still scheduled to
arrive early Wednesday for the meeting of the World Trade
Organization, which he had hoped would showcase American leadership
on free trade. The global organization is meant to resolve trade
disputes and promote free trade, and the Seattle meeting is
intended to open a new round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But the protesters have descended on Seattle with an eclectic
array of grievances, most centered around the sentiment that the
trade organization is a handmaiden of corporate interests whose
rulings undermine health, labor and environmental protections
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day the protesters surrounded the convention hall,
pinned trade dignitaries in their hotels and stopped traffic on
several intersections. By late afternoon, there was a barrage of
tear gas canisters fired as Mayor Paul Schell declared a state of
emergency in the downtown area, asked for the National Guard and
ordered a curfew that would last until sunrise Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke, in announcing that he was calling in state
National Guard troops, said the troops were ``trained in crowd
control'' and would be unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   The police used tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets at
some intersections to break up the demonstrators. A small group of
men, dressed in black clothing and masks and ignoring cries of
``Shame on you!'' from other protesters, smashed windows and
spray-painted graffiti at downtown stores like Nordstrom, Niketown,
Starbucks and the Gap. Both were jarring sights in a city that
prides itself on its laid-back image.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other scheduled
speakers for opening ceremonies Tuesday morning were unable to get
through the crowd, which in many cases blocked intersections by
linking hands or lying down on the street.
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of protesters already gathered downtown and about
20,000 additional marchers in a union-backed rally headed that way,
the trade body's director-general, Mike Moore, the former prime
minister of New Zealand, announced early Tuesday afternoon that the
opening ceremonies would be put off. But he vowed that the trade
talks would go on. In fact, he held meetings Tuesday with a few
trade ministers who managed to leave their hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiating groups are in full swing,'' Moore said. ``This
conference will be a success.'' Outside, protesters chanted:
``Whose world? Our world! Whose streets? Our streets!''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction of the trade delegates here seemed to run the gamut,
from bewilderment to bemusement to, in some cases, anger. As
demonstrators shouted ``Go home! Go home!'' a German delegate,
Arnold Schwez, made his way back inside the Sheraton Hotel after he
could not get through the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people don't understand the benefits of free trade to
the developing nations,'' Schwez said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday night, as Christmas lights and displays came on in
parts of downtown streets, demonstrators continued to hold their
position on the streets. A few fires, most set in trash cans,
burned in the street.

 SEATTLE: the street.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This is a sad day,'' Moore told reporters. ``To those who
argue that we should stop our work, I say: Tell that to the poor,
to the marginalized around the world who are looking to us to help
them.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Seattle police, Clem Benton, said Tuesday
evening that he could confirm at least 19 arrests of protesters on
Tuesday, several of whom were charged with assault. That number
appeared likely to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Police continued to move through parts of downtown with armored
personnel carriers. As white clouds of tear gas passed down the
streets, protesters coughed, cried and asked for water. Farther
back, groups of demonstrators chanted: ``The whole world is
watching!''
</P>
<P>
   Many demonstrators said they believed the bursts of tear gas
were unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   In at least a few instances, uniformed officers fired
rubber-coated bullets at the shins, thighs and arms of protesters
who police believed were charging police lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here peacefully, we just want our message to be
heard,'' said Gloria Haselwander, a 21-year-old clerk in a Seattle
music store. She said she believes that the world trade group's
rulings contribute to environmental destruction and ever-greater
gaps between the world's richest people and its poorest. ``We kept
saying, `No violence, no violence,' but there was just this mass of
gas. My throat hurts, my lungs still hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Simpich, a lawyer from San Francisco, said most protesters
were intent on being nonviolent, but also were intent on continuing
their demonstrations until the trade body's procedures were
reformed to take account of health and environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will keep marching until the process is open and until they
let the people in the door when the decisions are made,'' said
Simpich, who started his day in the rainy, predawn darkness by
gathering with other protesters in a park near the city's Pike
Place Market and then marching toward the convention hall. Rain
continued intermittently through the morning, but then stopped for
most of the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our goal,'' said Simpich, ``and one of these days it
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Trevor King, who works in a bookstore in Edmonton, Alberta, said
he deplored the window-smashing and other acts of destruction, but
felt that they should not deter from the message of the thousands
who marched nonviolently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, in most ways, the day was incredibly successful,''
said King, who was wearing a yellow rain slicker that proclaimed
the Seattle march to be the ``Protest of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mayor Schell and other city leaders, who had once eagerly
sought the meeting to showcase Seattle's role as a major exporter
in one of the most trade-dependent regions of the country, the
immediate focus Tuesday evening was simply on restoring order. But
they were bound to face questions in the days ahead about their
preparations for protests and, perhaps, to face conflicting bursts
of criticism about the police moving too harshly on the protesters
or not acting aggressively enough to head off the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the demonstrators were clearly opposed to the
window-smashing and other destructive acts by a small knot of
protesters, most of whom were young men dressed in black, wearing
masks and declining to give their names when asked by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anarchy rules!'' said one, carrying a trash can down the
street and then using it to smash a window of a Starbucks coffee
shop.

VERNON JORDAN IS JOINING LAZARD FRERES, THE INVESTMENT BANK IN NEW
YORK

 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vernon E. Jordan Jr., a close friend of President Clinton and a
leading political power broker in Washington, is giving up his
senior executive position with the law firm Akin, Gump, Strauss,
Hauer &AMP; Feld to become a partner in Lazard Freres &AMP; Co., the
private investment bank, in New York in January.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, one of the most powerful black men in the country, said
in a telephone interview that his focus will shift from legislation
to global corporate strategy when he moves from Washington to Wall
Street. ``I won't be talking about how do you work some particular
law,'' he said. ``I'm going to be an investment banker giving
strategic advice.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the timing of his move as ``more propitious'' than
when he had been approached to move to Wall Street in the past. It
comes at the tail end of Clinton's presidency and in the wake of
the tumultuous impeachment hearings in which the 64-year-old Jordan
had to testify about the role he played in finding a corporate job
in New York for Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern at
the center of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   While Jordan and his partners at Akin, Gump stressed that he
will maintain an advisory role with the firm and its legal clients,
his presence in political and social circles in Washington is
likely to diminish when he begins commuting from his home there to
Lazard's offices in Rockefeller Center. ``I'll do what I've been
doing for years,'' Jordan said. ``I'll ride the shuttle or, when
the weather's bad, I'll take the train.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lazard, a firm that is in the midst of a sweeping
reorganization, Jordan will be expected to use his contacts with
corporate chief executives to help rebuild the firm's stature as a
leading adviser on corporate mergers and acquisitions. In June,
after a series of high-level defections from Lazard's New York
office, the firm's chairman, Michel David-Weill, announced that, by
the end of the year, the firm would integrate its operations in New
York, Paris and London into a single, global unit.
</P>
<P>
   In looking for a partner with a platinum Rolodex, Lazard could
hardly have done better than landing Jordan, said Stephen Hess, a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ``He's a hell of a
rainmaker,'' Hess said of Jordan. ``I can only assume that he's
going to make more money and have more fun, not that he hasn't been
making a lot of money and having a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess said Jordan long ago stopped practicing law and became a
trusted adviser to politicians and corporate leaders. He fell into
``an old tradition in Washington of people who can carry messages
because they have built respect for their word,'' Hess said. ``They
build trust in what they do by getting the message straight and
being good negotiators. In the sort of interactions he has, it
probably doesn't make much difference whether he's a partner in a
law firm or an investment banker.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has been a fixture in the Washington establishment since
he joined Akin, Gump in 1982. In many ways, he modeled his legal
career on the firm's patriarch and senior partner, Robert S.
Strauss. Strauss, a titan in the Democratic Party, also served as a
confidant to Republicans, including former Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole and former President George Bush, in whose administration
he served as ambassador to the Soviet Union and the Russian
Republic. When Strauss left for Moscow, he looked to Jordan to
carry on the firm's tradition as a legal and political powerhouse
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Like Strauss, who rejoined the firm after his sojourn in Moscow,
Jordan eschewed lobbying, preferring to quietly counsel a stable of
corporations on how to craft their legislative strategies rather
than going to Capitol Hill to plead their causes. That work was
left to more junior lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan became embroiled in the Lewinsky scandal, Strauss
and other figures in the Washington establishment defended Jordan.
In a televised interview on the CBS News program ``60 Minutes,''
Strauss said, ``Vernon isn't a man who does things that he knows to
be either conceivably illegal or improper. He doesn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was also the bridge between Bill and Hillary Clinton and
the Washington establishment, a bridge that has grown more fragile
over time. In 1991, he took them to the Jockey Club, once a
favorite haunt of Nancy Reagan, to have dinner with Thomas S.
Foley, then speaker of the House (and later ambassador to Japan)
and the late Pamela Harriman, a formidable Democratic party
fund-raiser who became ambassador to France.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's who you need to be having dinner with if you want to
run for president,'' Jordan told the Clintons. That same year, he
took Clinton to the Bilderberg conference in Germany, an exclusive
annual retreat for international businessmen and political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan did not name money as a motivating factor for his
decision to join Lazard. People who know him estimate that he earns
considerably more than $1 million a year at Akin, Gump. But that is
far less than a partner at an investment bank like Lazard can earn.
People close to Lazard say that Jordan negotiated a handsome,
guaranteed income in meetings with David-Weill.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has stirred up some controversy by holding seats on the
boards of a large number of public corporations, a practice he said
he would not necessarily change after he joins Lazard. He sits on
10 corporate boards, including those of the American Express Co.,
the Revlon Group, the Xerox Corp. and Dow Jones &AMP; Co. He is also a
member of the international advisory council of automaker
DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers once were fixtures in corporate boardrooms,
but that has changed. Now most chief executives are concerned that
having an active investment banker as a director could create the
appearance of a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the possibility of a conflict, but I've dealt with
conflicts before,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also intends to remain politically active. He has
helped rally support for Jon S. Corzine's Senate campaign in New
Jersey and called Corzine, the former chairman of the investment
bank Goldman Sachs Group, a rival of Lazard, a ``very good
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said the idea of becoming an investment banker was
broached by William Loomis, Lazard's chief executive in New York,
who approached him. He said he did not consider joining any other
firm on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   He is the latest of a group of people with ties to the Clinton
administration to make the leap into the financial world. Rahm
Emanuel, a Clinton adviser, joined Wasserstein Perella &AMP; Co., a New
York-based boutique investment bank in Chicago earlier this year.
Erskine Bowles, a former chief of staff in the Clinton White House,
returned to investment banking last year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Loomis said that Jordan would be the 10th partner Lazard has
added since June. He said Jordan would be a senior partner ``by
virtue of how he is.'' But Jordan will not have a management role
at the firm and will not immediately be in line to run the firm or
its New York operation, people inside the firm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vernon Jordan epitomizes the people we are looking for,''
David-Weill said. ``We want people who are strong individuals.
That's the way this firm functions.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm has been trying to add influential people since losing
some of its best-connected senior partners, including Felix G.
Rohatyn, who is now U.S. Ambassador to France, and Kenneth Wilson,
who joined Goldman Sachs as a partner. Steven Rattner, who stepped
down as chief executive of Lazard in New York earlier this year,
plans to leave the firm in 2000, people inside the firm said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's ranking among advisers in mergers and acquisitions
worldwide fell to 13th last year from fourth in 1997, according to
Thomson Financial Securities Data. This year, with a wave of
mergers in Europe, Lazard has rebounded to rank ninth among
advisers in announced deals.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Downtown Seattle was placed under curfew, and the
National Guard was called in Tuesday after sometimes violent
protests by thousands of people forced a postponement of the
opening of a major international trade conference.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disorders, President Clinton was still scheduled to
arrive early Wednesday for the meeting of the World Trade
Organization, which he had hoped would showcase American leadership
on free trade. The global organization is meant to resolve trade
disputes and promote free trade, and the Seattle meeting is
intended to open a new round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But the protesters have descended on Seattle with an eclectic
array of grievances, most centered around the sentiment that the
trade organization is a handmaiden of corporate interests whose
rulings undermine health, labor and environmental protections
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day the protesters surrounded the convention hall,
pinned trade dignitaries in their hotels and stopped traffic on
several intersections. By late afternoon, there was a barrage of
tear gas canisters fired as Mayor Paul Schell declared a state of
emergency in the downtown area, asked for the National Guard and
ordered a curfew that would last until sunrise Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke, in announcing that he was calling in state
National Guard troops, said the troops were ``trained in crowd
control'' and would be unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   The police used tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets at
some intersections to break up the demonstrators. A small group of
men, dressed in black clothing and masks and ignoring cries of
``Shame on you!'' from other protesters, smashed windows and
spray-painted graffiti at downtown stores like Nordstrom, Niketown,
Starbucks and the Gap. Both were jarring sights in a city that
prides itself on its laid-back image.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other scheduled
speakers for opening ceremonies Tuesday morning were unable to get
through the crowd, which in many cases blocked intersections by
linking hands or lying down on the street.
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of protesters already gathered downtown and about
20,000 additional marchers in a union-backed rally headed that way,
the trade body's director-general, Mike Moore, the former prime
minister of New Zealand, announced early Tuesday afternoon that the
opening ceremonies would be put off. But he vowed that the trade
talks would go on. In fact, he held meetings Tuesday with a few
trade ministers who managed to leave their hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiating groups are in full swing,'' Moore said. ``This
conference will be a success.'' Outside, protesters chanted:
``Whose world? Our world! Whose streets? Our streets!''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction of the trade delegates here seemed to run the gamut,
from bewilderment to bemusement to, in some cases, anger. As
demonstrators shouted ``Go home! Go home!'' a German delegate,
Arnold Schwez, made his way back inside the Sheraton Hotel after he
could not get through the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people don't understand the benefits of free trade to
the developing nations,'' Schwez said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday night, as Christmas lights and displays came on in
parts of downtown streets, demonstrators continued to hold their
position on the streets. A few fires, most set in trash cans,
burned in the street.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad day,'' Moore told reporters. ``To those who
argue that we should stop our work, I say: Tell that to the poor,
to the marginalized around the world who are looking to us to help
them.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Seattle police, Clem Benton, said Tuesday
evening that he could confirm at least 19 arrests of protesters on
Tuesday, several of whom were charged with assault. That number
appeared likely to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Police continued to move through parts of downtown with armored
personnel carriers. As white clouds of tear gas passed down the
streets, protesters coughed, cried and asked for water. Farther
back, groups of demonstrators chanted: ``The whole world is
watching!''
</P>
<P>
   Many demonstrators said they believed the bursts of tear gas
were unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   In at least a few instances, uniformed officers fired
rubber-coated bullets at the shins, thighs and arms of protesters
who police believed were charging police lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here peacefully, we just want our message to be
heard,'' said Gloria Haselwander, a 21-year-old clerk in a Seattle
music store. She said she believes that the world trade group's
rulings contribute to environmental destruction and ever-greater
gaps between the world's richest people and its poorest. ``We kept
saying, `No violence, no violence,' but there was just this mass of
gas. My throat hurts, my lungs still hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Simpich, a lawyer from San Francisco, said most protesters
were intent on being nonviolent, but also were intent on continuing
their demonstrations until the trade body's procedures were
reformed to take account of health and environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will keep marching until the process is open and until they
let the people in the door when the decisions are made,'' said
Simpich, who started his day in the rainy, predawn darkness by
gathering with other protesters in a park near the city's Pike
Place Market and then marching toward the convention hall. Rain
continued intermittently through the morning, but then stopped for
most of the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our goal,'' said Simpich, ``and one of these days it
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Trevor King, who works in a bookstore in Edmonton, Alberta, said
he deplored the window-smashing and other acts of destruction, but
felt that they should not deter from the message of the thousands
who marched nonviolently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, in most ways, the day was incredibly successful,''
said King, who was wearing a yellow rain slicker that proclaimed
the Seattle march to be the ``Protest of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mayor Schell and other city leaders, who had once eagerly
sought the meeting to showcase Seattle's role as a major exporter
in one of the most trade-dependent regions of the country, the
immediate focus Tuesday evening was simply on restoring order. But
they were bound to face questions in the days ahead about their
preparations for protests and, perhaps, to face conflicting bursts
of criticism about the police moving too harshly on the protesters
or not acting aggressively enough to head off the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the demonstrators were clearly opposed to the
window-smashing and other destructive acts by a small knot of
protesters, most of whom were young men dressed in black, wearing
masks and declining to give their names when asked by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anarchy rules!'' said one, carrying a trash can down the
street and then using it to smash a window of a Starbucks coffee
shop.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday evening, both the mayor and the
city's police chief, Norm Stamper, said they respected the right of
protesters to gather here, and they blamed the violence on a small
percentage of those in the crowd. ``We have demonstrators who are
continuing to express their point of view,'' said Stamper. ``Most
are doing it nonviolently, some are doing it violently.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was unable to deliver his
speech to delegates. In his prepared text, he said: ``Unless we
convince developing countries that globalization really does
benefit them, the backlash against it will become irresistible.
That would be a tragedy for the developing world.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday morning, close to 20,000 union members and their
allies packed Memorial Stadium, next to the Space Needle, to hear
anti-WTO speakers. The speakers ranged from James Hoffa, the
Teamsters union president, to Carl Pope, the executive director of
the Sierra Club, and Wei Jingsheng, a Chinese dissident.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker after speaker voiced anger that, in their depiction, the
trade organization favored corporations and overturned national
laws that protected the environment, endangered species and
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Several union leaders also belittled the trade group's push for
free trade, saying it has encouraged American companies to move
operations overseas where workers are paid far less and have few
rights.
</P>
<P>
   To thunderous applause, Jay Mazur, president of the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, said, ``The rules
of this new global economy have been rigged against workers and
we're not going to play by them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   A few union leaders took a protectionist tone, condemning the
flood of imports, which they said had wiped out hundreds of
thousands of well-paying American manufacturing jobs. But most of
the union leaders focused on pressuring the WTO to protect workers'
rights as a way to lift living standards around the world and close
the growing gap between rich and poor in many developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, the AFL-CIO's president, said, ``Until the WTO
addresses these issues, we should not and must not permit our
country to participate in a new round of trade negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   After the rally, the union members, joined by environmentalists
and other protesters, began a two-mile-long march that skirted the
area of the sit-ins and the tear gas. Protesters carried signs that
included, ``Labor Rights Not Trade Wrongs,'' ``End Corporate Rule''
and ``Make the Global Economy Work for Working People.''
</P>
<P>
   As the marchers snaked through downtown, most of the best-known
downtown department stores, including Nordstrom and Bon Marche,
were closed. Even many Starbucks were shut, with a protester
painting ``We Want Fair Wages'' on the door of a Starbucks on Third
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters marched past the Westin Hotel, where the American
delegation is staying. The hotel was ringed by city buses that were
purposely parked bumper to bumper to prevent the WTO's critics from
approaching the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The sit-ins brought traffic in many parts of the city to a
standstill and angered many motorists. A sit-in at the corner of
Sixth Avenue and Seneca Street prevented cars from leaving a
freeway exit during the morning rush.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Derouin, a customer service worker for Amazon.com. who
was trapped for half an hour after taking the Seneca Street exit,
said, ``I sympathize with them, but I wish they didn't put me out
like this. But if I didn't have a job, I'd probably be out there
protesting with them.''

FORMER GERMAN CHANCELLOR ADMITS TO USE OF SECRET PARTY FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 2nd graf to CORRECT dollar sum accepted by former treasurer
to $670,000, or 1 million marks.) 
 (js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl,
who has been facing widening accusations of having run illegal
political slush funds, admitted Tuesday that he had used cash from
secret bank accounts to help local branches of his party, the
Christian Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's admission aggravated a nationwide uproar that began three
weeks ago, after disclosures that the party's former treasurer
secretly accepted 1 million marks, about $670,000 at the time, from
an arms merchant in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, prosecutors have turned up evidence that Kohl's
party maintained numerous secret bank accounts that may have been
used to accept illegal political contributions from business
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl engineered the reunification of Germany and reigned as
chancellor for 16 years before losing an election last year. Until
Tuesday, he had dismissed all the allegations as ``a lot of noise
about nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of his own former colleagues have gone public with
their own allegations in the last few days. Heiner Geissler, who
was general secretary of the Christian Democratic Union from 1977
until 1989, said on Monday that he had repeatedly argued with Kohl
about the secret accounts and that the former chancellor knew
everything about them.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Christian Democratic leaders acknowledged that there
may indeed have been improper financial dealings and that these may
have persisted until as recently as a year ago. There have been no
allegations so far that individual political leaders enriched
themselves. The main question is whether the party has been selling
influence.
</P>
<P>
   In an uncharacteristically contrite written statement, Kohl
admitted that he had used secret accounts to provide financial
support for local party branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have, as chairman of the party, deemed as necessary the
confidential treatment of certain issues, such as special payments
to party branches and associations,'' Kohl said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl said it was reasonable to describe the secret accounts as
having been ``managed separately'' from those of the party's normal
federal treasury. He said he regretted that he may have allowed a
``lack of transparency'' in party finances and perhaps even a
violation of the party's own rules. ``That is not what I wanted,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are investigating what appears to be a network of
accounts. The parliament plans to establish a special investigative
committee on Thursday. And the Christian Democratic Union has
itself hired the accounting firm of Ernst &AMP; Young to examine its
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible that not all the party rules were adhered to,''
said Wolfgang Schauble, Kohl's successor as chairman of the
Christian Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``No one enriched themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation could lead to criminal charges against some
Christian Democratic officials. Under German law, political parties
are required to disclose publicly all contributions and their
sources. Prosecutors are also investigating whether people who
either accepted or channeled covert contributions evaded taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The most damaging allegation _ but also the most difficult to
prove _ is that Kohl and other party leaders sold favors for large
sums of money.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the spreading revelations threaten to tarnish
Kohl's reputation as the statesman who reunified Germany and was
Europe's most formidable political leader throughout the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   They will also deal a major political blow to the Christian
Democrats, who were just beginning to recover from their
devastating electoral defeat last year to the Social Democratic
Party of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first allegations surfaced in early November as a result of
a long-running investigation into tax evasion by Walther Leisler
Kiep, who served as the Christian Democrats' treasurer for many
years, until 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Tax investigators charged that Kiep had failed to pay taxes
after receiving 1 million marks from an arms trader, Karlheinz
Schreiber. At the time, Schreiber was trying to get government
approval for the sale of tanks to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber, whom the German authorities are trying to extradite
from Canada, reportedly handed Kiep a suitcase filled with cash.
Kiep admitted receiving the money but insisted that he had merely
put it in a special party-controlled bank account.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper,
Kiep said he knew Schreiber ``wanted to do something good for the
party'' but had no idea that 1 million marks would be handed over.
</P>
<P>
   The German government approved the sale of the tanks, and the
investigation focuses on whether there was a quid pro quo. Party
officials say, though, that the sale was logical because Germany
was not sending troops to the Persian Gulf during the military
campaign against Iraq, and the sale of tanks was a way to provide
support.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have now uncovered a number of other unofficial bank
accounts that also appear to have been means for receiving a wide
variety of political contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Schauble, the Christian Democrats' current chairman, said
Tuesday that there appear to have been a number of other unofficial
accounts during the 1990s. The last was shut down at the end of
1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such accounts are not in themselves illegal, nor are large
political contributions. The legal issue is whether the
contributions were properly reported and whether the money was used
to buy influence.
</P>
<P>
   Geissler, the party's longtime general secretary, has alleged
that Kohl used the accounts to buy the political loyalty of local
and regional party officials.
</P>
<P>
   But Geissler, an acerbic and cerebral politician who is almost a
mirror opposite of the backslapping Kohl, has been a sworn enemy of
the former chancellor for years now.
</P>
<P>
   For Germany's governing Social Democrats and for Schroeder, the
swirl of new charges are a welcome relief from their own recent
troubles. The Social Democrats have been battered in a series of
regional elections from the Rhineland to Berlin to Hesse, the state
that contains Frankfurt and Germany's main financial center.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Struck, a Social Democratic Party leader in parliament,
said allegations will be pursued wherever they may lead. ``The
investigating committee will have to determine whether there was
influence exerted on the decisions of the federal government,'' he
said Tuesday. ``One can't simply believe what Kohl says.''

PROFITABLE CANADIAN BANKS MAKE PLANS FOR CUTBACKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Canada's biggest banks are reporting record total
profits, while laying out plans to cut jobs and branches to further
increase their rates of return. In a country where banks dominate
the corporate landscape and are already a focus of consumer
discontent, advocacy groups are saying that fatter profits probably
mean people will pay more for less service.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide branch networks have been the backbone of Canada's
financial sector for decades. But with the growth of electronic
banking and a range of new money-management services, having a
branch on the main street corners of most cities and towns is
outdated and costly, said Jamie Keating, a banking analyst at
Merrill Lynch Canada Inc. in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has one-third more bank branches in relation to its
population than does the United States. The banks are now closing
hundreds of traditional branches and trimming as many as 15,000
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, four of Canada's largest banks proposed merging into
two much bigger ones. Mergers were needed, the banks told
governments and their customers, to help them compete with the
global giants. But the mergers would also have made it relatively
easy to close up to a fifth of Canada's 13,000 branches.
</P>
<P>
   When Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin blocked the mergers,
the bankers devised alternative plans. If the cost-cutting measures
seem severe, it is largely because revenue growth is beginning to
slow, said Kevin Choquette, a banking analyst at Scotia Capital
Markets in Toronto. And faced with slower growth and more foreign
competitors at home, expansion outside Canada is a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Never have Canada's big banks been in better shape for ambitious
undertakings. Toronto Dominion, Canada's fifth-largest bank, is now
the country's most profitable bank and growing in size. Toronto
Dominion has been allowed to buy Canada Trust, which will move it
up to third place, measured by assets.. But 5,000 jobs will be lost
as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Bank of Canada, the nation's second-largest bank, provides
the best example of how Canadian banks are adjusting their
priorities. Its profit of 1.7 billion Canadian dollars, or $1.1
billion, for fiscal 1999 yielded a 15.3 percent return on equity,
which is good but not considered good enough by its management.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to take over $400 million of costs out of our base
over the next year,'' said chairman John Cleghorn. A prime
objective is a 17 to 20 percent return on equity. The bank plans to
cut up to 4,000 jobs over the next year and 2,000 more a year
later.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of Montreal, the fourth-largest bank, reported a record
profit of 1.4 billion Canadian dollars, or $952 million, for fiscal
1999, but it is planning to cut 1,500 jobs and 10 percent of its
1,040 branches. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the biggest,
has not yet released 1999 results but plans to cut annual operating
costs by 500 million Canadian dollars. That could mean at least
2,000 fewer jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Nova Scotia, which Tuesday reported an 11.5 percent
gain in fiscal 1999 earnings, to 1.55 billion Canadian dollars, or
about $1 billion, has not announced any layoffs but has said it
will cut costs by 100 million dollars next year.
</P>
<P>
   Returns on equity among Canadian banks, while high, are roughly
two percentage points lower than the 17 to 19 percent achieved by
many banks in the United States. Raising returns to retain favor
among investors, the bankers admit, will mean they will no longer
try to provide all services to all customers.
</P>
<P>
   Trimming costs and services is one route to higher returns, but
consumers and small-business groups also fear that banking fees,
which are lower than in the United States, will go up. ``The banks
are making more money by withdrawing full service rather than
serving their customers well,'' said Duff Conacher, chairman of a
Toronto-based coalition of labor and consumer groups.

BANK OF NEW YORK EX-EMPLOYEE CHARGED IN RUSSIA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal authorities arrested a former Bank of New
York employee Tuesday on charges of making false statements to
investigators in a money laundering inquiry involving the bank and
its clients in Russia. She entered a plea of not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   According to a criminal complaint filed Monday and unsealed
Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan, the former employee,
Svetlana Kudryavtsev, of Brooklyn, lied about dealings with Lucy
Edwards and Peter Berlin, a married couple at the center of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards formerly worked as a vice president in the Bank of
New York's Eastern European division, while Berlin ran two money
transfer businesses known as the Benex International Co. and Becs
International. More than $7 billion flowed from Russia through
accounts held by those companies at the Bank of New York. An
undetermined portion of the money may have come from criminal
activities, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. attorney for
the Southern District of New York have been examining that movement
of funds since September, 1998, but no money laundering charges
have been filed. Ms. Edwards, Berlin and a business associate,
Aleksey Volkov, were indicted by a federal grand jury in September
on criminal charges of illegally running a money transfer business.
The Bank of New York has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kudryavtsev, 49, was fired by the bank last August for
failing to cooperate with the investigation. She earned about
$42,000 a year in Ms. Edwards' division and, according to the
complaint, received about $30,000 from Ms. Edwards and her husband
between 1995 and 1999. Some of that money was paid through Benex
and Highborough Services, another company said to have been
controlled by the couple.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint said that Ms. Kudryavtsev lied to investigators in
August about having received money from the couple and also lied
about having any knowledge of their business activities.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Charles D. Adler of Manhattan, said, ``Svetlana
Kudryavtsev is not charged with any kind of financial crime. She is
only charged with false statements to two FBI agents who subjected
her to a surprise interrogation in a language with which she is not
completely comfortable and which appears to have been designed to
trap her.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Ms. Kudryavtsev is a longstanding and close friend
of Lucy Edwards. Any small amount of money that passed between them
was the product of that friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kudryavtsev was released on $30,000 bail and had to forfeit
her passport. She faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison
and at least $250,000 in penalties if found guilty of the charges
against her. Her husband, Vladimir Kudryavtsev, who the complaint
said also received money from Ms. Edwards and Berlin, was not
charged with wrongdoing and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Ms. Kudryavtsev first met Ms.
Edwards in St. Petersburg, Russia, about 15 years ago and was
originally recommended for a job at the Bank of New York in 1993 by
Ms. Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Among documents investigators discovered in Ms. Kudryavtsev's
work space at the Bank of New York was a letter, written in Russian
and postmarked earlier this year, from Ms. Edward's father, Zinovi
Pritsker, explaining that Pritsker was sending Ms. Kudryavtsev
$1,100 at Berlin's request. Shortly after receiving the letter, Ms.
Kudryavtsev deposited $1,100 into her personal bank account at the
Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint also said that Berlin told an unidentified Bank of
New York employee who had responsibility for the Benex and Becs
accounts to call Ms. Kudryavtsev about those accounts if Berlin
could not be reached. Similarly, an employee at the Torfinex Corp.,
a company run by Berlin's business associate, Volkov, also told
investigators that a ``Svetlana'' at the Bank of New York could
resolve any problems involving Benex or Becs.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors still face serious challenges. The charges against
Ms. Edwards and Berlin, now in London, fall short of money
laundering charges, which are typically difficult to prove. The
couple have declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the U.S. attorney's Office in Manhattan
asked a federal judge to adjourn its case against the couple for 60
days because it was having difficulty securing jurisdiction over
them..

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Celebrating the sixth anniversary of the Brady
law, which mandates waiting periods and background checks for gun
buyers, President Clinton said on Tuesday that the system had
blocked more than 470,000 gun sales to ``felons, fugitives,
stalkers and others prohibited from purchasing firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   In just the last year, since the FBI began instant computerized
checks of gun buyers' criminal histories, 160,000 sales have been
prevented, the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers, of course, are not just numbers,'' said
Clinton, who signed the Brady bill into law on Nov. 30, 1993.
``They represent lives saved, injuries avoided, tragedies
averted.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he proclaimed the success of the law _ named for James
S. Brady, former President Ronald Reagan's press secretary who was
severely wounded by an attempted assassin of Reagan on March 30,
1981 _ Clinton called on Congress to put further controls on guns
next year. Republicans and Democrats were unable to agree on the
details of a package of bills in the congressional session just
ended. Both parties have cast gun control as an issue in the 2000
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 32,000 Americans still lose their lives in gunfire every
year, including 12 children every day,'' the president said. ``That
is why I pledge to make passage of common-sense gun legislation my
top public safety priority next year. And I challenge Congress to
make a New Year's resolution to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the measures offered by Clinton that Congress failed to
approve were a one-gun-a-month limit for individuals and criminal
background checks for buyers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association, which fought the Brady bill and
tried to prevent Clinton's other initiatives, said the
administration ought to focus on enforcing existing laws rather
than adding new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 20,000-odd gun laws on the books, many of them on
the federal level,'' said an NRA spokesman Jim Baker. ``Enforcing
those ought to be the priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Brady law went into effect in March 1994, an estimated
412,000 felons, fugitives and mentally ill people have been
prevented from buying handguns, the Justice Department says.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials, prosecutors and criminologists generally
believe the Brady law has contributed to the decline in crime in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But some advocates of gun control contend that the law did not
go far enough to close loopholes in federal gun laws. For example,
the Brady law has not curbed the practice of straw purchasing, in
which a person without a criminal record buys a gun on behalf of a
felon.
</P>
<P>
   On a West Coast swing, the president said at a fund-raiser here
for Democratic congressional candidates that electing more
Democrats would help to improve the gun laws. From San Francisco,
he went to Los Angeles to receive honors from the Center to Prevent
Handgun Violence, a nonprofit organization that wants more gun
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced another measure on Tuesday intended to curb
the illegal marketing of firearms to juveniles and criminals _ a
computer database to help agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms trace weapons used in crimes. Under the original Brady
law, the state and local authorities were responsible for
conducting background checks on potential buyers. That system
expired a year ago, along with a five-day waiting period for
buyers. Since then, the FBI has begun the National Instant Criminal
Background Check System, which it operates jointly with state
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system has proven to be highly effective, performing more
than 8.7 million checks in its first 12 months,'' Attorney General
Janet Reno said in a statement.

COMMENTARY: THUGS AND GOONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ James Carville is sorry he called the mayor of New
York a thug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really shouldn't have used that word,'' the Democratic
strategist concedes. ``There is actually a better word: goon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was gonna use bully. And tyrant, but that was too regal, too
much like George III. Mean-spirited? The congressional Republicans
have already stolen that word. So I'm kinda left with goon.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Washington's pit bull pitted against New York's pit
bull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giuliani and I _ that's perfect,'' Carville exults. ``He and I
are at about the same level. Yeah, I'm sort of a political goon.
But I ain't running for Senate. He's a man without any public
compassion and he fights with everybody over everything. It would
be like having me for a senator. It would be a big disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   As he goes after ``the Murdoch/Giuliani crowd,'' the War Room
general who strafed Gennifer Flowers, George Bush, Paula Jones,
Kenneth Starr and Benjamin Netanyahu now has opponents worthy of
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I don't go pickin' on the lame, the halt and the
blind,'' Carville says. ``Giuliani loves to attack little people.
He enjoys it.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Meet the Press'' last Sunday, the bald, boisterous one said
he had called Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign to offer to rant at
Rudy: ``Corporal Cueball is volunteering. I'm going to New York,
I'm setting up committees, and we're going to call it the Committee
to Combat Thuggery, and we're going to take on all these thugs in
the Giuliani campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, a Giuliani adviser, ripostes: ``I find it
fascinating that we're accused of being negative by the same people
who are calling us thugs.'' He decried the ``imported'' nasty
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the mayor's camp feel the word ``thugs'' was intended to
conjure up the image of ``an Italian gang.''
</P>
<P>
   Carville denies that: ``What else do you call somebody who jails
the homeless at Thanksgiving? The Godfather would have never jailed
100 homeless people. He would have sent them out some soup.''
</P>
<P>
   As his ``cueballers'' cheer on Hillary and keep tabs on Rudy, he
will wave a red flag. ``I can be the rodeo clown to Giuliani's
bull, to try to deflect the bull away,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But won't the presence of the ragin' Cajun just enhance the
impression of outsiders descending on Gotham?
</P>
<P>
   ``If Rudy Giuliani can go to Texas and raise money,'' Carville
says, ``we can go to New York and raise Cain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic barker will not be able to toy with this
righteous prosecutor as he toyed with the last. Ken Starr was naive
and politically inept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then you get a perfect fat pitch you get to
clobber,'' Carville says happily.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``Stickin','' he sums up his method of
vengeful, partisan attack: ``It's hard for somebody to hit you when
you have your fist in their face.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Mrs. Clinton had done to earn Pat Moynihan's seat,
</P>
<P>
   Carville shot back: ``She's been on the board of directors of
Wal-Mart. How many people have run for the Senate on less than
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about George Stephanopoulos' observation in Newsweek that
Mrs. Clinton can be ``a clumsy tactician prone to
second-guessing,'' Carville agreed, ``She can be a little
hard-headed from time to time.'' But he predicted: ``she's going to
wear very well. I think she's got a really good personality. She's
fun. There are some people who don't like ambitious women and they
ain't going to vote for her. We've lost 'em. Never had 'em. Not
going to get 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   While it has been wonderfully effective, Carville's tactic of
demonizing attackers of the Clintons has a way of preventing
ethical questions from being aired, and allows Bill Clinton to
evade responsibility for his own bad behavior. When does a
strategist become an enabler?
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably am,'' he replies. ``That is a legitimate
observation. But I ain't going to fall out with anybody but my wife
over sex. And you know what? That son of a ... has always been good
to me. He has always been good to my mother. In the end, by and
large, I think he is a pretty kind guy. And to me, he has never
committed the ultimate sin and that is being gratuitous or cruel to
little people and that is what I don't like about Giuliani.''

TRUE NORTH WILL ACQUIRE STEIN ROGAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An agency company that was early to explore
cyberspace is expanding again in the fast-growing realm of digital
communications, acquiring a New York shop specializing in online
and offline advertising for dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   True North Communications in Chicago, the world's No. 7 agency
company with estimated billings of $12 billion, is buying Stein
Rogan &AMP; Partners in New York, which has estimated capitalized
billings of $75 million from clients like Apartment.com,
Blackboard.com, Cars.com, Flycast, Mail.com and FasTV.com.
</P>
<P>
   Stein Rogan, with 70 employees, will operate as an autonomous
unit of True North, which also owns traditional agencies like FCB
Worldwide, Bozell and Temerlin McClain. The top managers of Stein
Rogan, which also has a small office in Chicago, will continue
leading the agency. They include Tom Stein, president, and Mark
Rogan, executive vice president and creative director.
</P>
<P>
   The deal for Stein Rogan, which started in 1986 as Stein
Kilpatrick &AMP; Rogan, is indicative of the intensification of efforts
by Madison Avenue to meet the challenges posed as the Internet
remakes advertising, marketing and the media, particularly in
competing against upstart startups.
</P>
<P>
   Giants like True North, the Omnicom Group, the Interpublic Group
of Companies and the WPP Group are responding with strategies that
range from acquisitions to investments in independent new-media
shops to opening digital units within their traditional agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Omnicom probably has the largest list of dot-com clients,''
said Michael J. Russell, an analyst who follows the advertising
industry for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York, ``but Bozell
has Datek and FCB has Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Omnicom and True North lead among the biggest agency companies
in estimated revenue to be derived from dot-coms in 2000, by
Russell's estimates, at about 3 percent of the total, compared with
about 1 percent for the others.
</P>
<P>
   The mad dash to capitalize on the dot-coms is not limited to
agencies. For instance, NBC, part of General Electric, is combining
several of its online operations with the portal Web site Snap.com
and Xoom.com, an electronic commerce company. The combined company,
named NBCi, began trading Tuesday on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   The True North cyberholdings include R/GA Interactive and 50
percent of Modem Media.Poppe Tyson, the digital agency that began
as two interactive units of FCB and Bozell before being combined
and eventually sold in an initial public offering. And DoubleClick,
the giant Web ad network, started in 1995 as the Internet sales
group of Poppe Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the explosion of e-commerce companies seeking to brand
themselves online and offline, it's obvious not every one is going
to win,'' said David Bell, chairman and chief executive at True
North. ``Tom and Mark are experts in placing their chips on those
that are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell discussed the acquisition in an interview Tuesday; the
formal announcement is to be made Wednesday. Terms of the deal are
not being disclosed, though recently agency acquisitions are being
made for prices equal to about one year's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Stein Rogan's 1998 revenue was $12 million and its revenue for
the first six months of 1999 was $11 million, according to
estimates by IQ Interactive News, a weekly supplement to the trade
publications Adweek, Brandweek and Mediaweek. The 1999 figure
placed the agency 24th among the top 50 interactive agencies ranked
by the supplement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to move on to bigger and better things,'' said
Stein, 43, ``and True North is going to help us get there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd started out as a general advertising agency but took
those capabilities and focused ourselves in 1995 as `the
information agency, using interactive media as a marketing venue,''
he added. ``We saw an opportunity that today involves building
brands in the Internet space in entertainment, education, finance,
e-business of all sorts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's going to be a tremendous continuing intensity of
activity in that space,'' Stein predicted. ``There will be not just
a lot of dot-com advertising on the Super Bowl, but all through the
first quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm exaggerating a little bit to say one or two business
models come across our desks every day,'' he added, ``and every one
we see is ramping up for 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan, 44, echoed his colleague's optimism, but noted that the
growing popularity of the Internet brings more dot-com campaigns,
which makes it increasingly difficult ``to break through the
clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So what you do for dot-com brands has to be done a lot
smarter,'' he added, ``and in Internet time.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he cited the work Stein Rogan has produced for
Cars.com, an automotive Web site operated by Classified Ventures, a
consortium of large newspaper companies. The campaign sought to
balance the needs of car shoppers with the needs of car dealers,
who are the site's primary revenue source.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to build a value proposition for Cars.com with
consumers,'' Stein said, ``but at the same time not alienate
dealers, who pay the freight.'' So rather than proceed with a
campaign carrying the theme ``Drive home a better deal,'' the
Cars.com ads carry this theme: ``Car shopping the way it should be.
Simple.''
</P>
<P>
   And the offline ads for Cars.com, on television and in
newspapers, ``have the look and feel of the Web site,'' Rogan said,
by including ``a lot of screen shots'' and even ``duplicating the
browser frame'' computer users see.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creatives fight that,'' he added, ``saying, `People know
they're going on the Web.' But there's nothing wrong with a product
demonstration.''

SPORTS COLUMN: LEADERSHIP, NOT RIDICULE, IS THE KEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Nets coach Don Casey stood in an empty
Continental Arena on Tuesday afternoon after a pregame
shoot-around. He spoke about wide-ranging, far-reaching subjects _
everything from Robert De Niro and James Dean, to playing hurt
versus playing it safe, to Keyshawn Johnson and Stephon Marbury, to
the difference between venting in frustration and providing
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Casey, whose Nets had won only two games
this season while losing 12, received a rare piece of good news
when the team doctor cleared Kerry Kittles to play. The lithe guard
had virtually missed the whole season thus far with a surgically
repaired knee that left him uncomfortable. But last night he was in
the starting lineup against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles was cleared to play early in the season but felt
weakness in the knee and decided to sit out until it become
stronger. So he sat and watched as his team sunk deeper. He played
only once _ a game in mid-November in which he scored 3 points in
seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cage, the Nets' 16-year National Basketball Association
veteran, admitted that he wondered what was going on with his young
teammate, but kept silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play with pain every day: sore back, sore knee, sore
ankle,'' the 37-year-old Cage said. ``That's just the nature of the
game. I went from injured reserve to the starting lineup the other
day. But that's me; I'm from the old school. We're in a different
age now.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey is an old-school coach with new-school sensibilities.
Admiring a player's fierce desire to play, but respecting a
player's instinct to preserve his body. Coveting the warrior but
respecting prudence.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a selfish viewpoint, I'd rather have seen him out here
two or three weeks ago,'' Casey said of Kittles. ``But you have to
be aware of a player's mind-set and his threshold. But that
argument of old school versus new school is there and you can't get
away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   As an assistant coach with the Boston Celtics, Casey remembered
how Larry Bird could not sit in a chair during timeouts because his
back was so bad. He recalled Michael Jordan scoring 63 points with
a hairline fracture in his foot. But Tuesday, Casey was more
perplexed by Keith Van Horn's early departure from the
shoot-around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed,'' a frustrated Casey said. ``I
heard he just bolted out.''
</P>
<P>
   But frustration has splattered all over the New York sports
scene lately with a force that has caught many of us by surprise.
New York teams had a great run for much of 1999: the Jets in the
American Football Conference title game, the Knicks in the NBA
finals, the Mets in October, the Yankees winning the World Series.
We forgot how miserable losing can be. Now it's coming back.
</P>
<P>
   After the Jets' slim playoff hopes disintegrated Sunday,
Keyshawn Johnson, the team's star receiver, blasted unnamed members
of his team for accepting losing. The Nets' Stephon Marbury has
ridiculed his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has refused to yield an inch to his fellow receiver,
Wayne Chrebet, feeling, perhaps with good reason, that Chrebet from
the beginning of his career was eagerly accorded stature and
respect that has only grudgingly been given to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury has been equally hard on Van Horn, who was hailed as the
next Larry Bird before he even took a shot. Van Horn lost a
security blanket when Jayson Williams was sidelined with a broken
leg. The hard-nosed Marbury is not inclined to lend a sympathetic
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the player's respective coach _ Parcells with the
Jets and Casey with the Nets _ has walked a thin line between
keeping his star's fires burning and getting him to be less
searing. Johnson is a key symbol of the Jets' renaissance; if the
Nets ever have a renaissance, Marbury will be its author.
</P>
<P>
   Casey is shepherding Marbury through the pastures of a difficult
season, a season the coach may not survive. Casey is showing
Marbury that criticism, like the game of basketball, has more than
one dimension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Bird would pass a guy who was leaving practice early,''
Casey recalled. ``He'd say, `You must be shooting 50 percent.' You
don't want to extinguish passion, just rechannel it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury has an entire season before him. The Nets have talent;
Marbury has to bring it out. ``He realizes now that he has to use
his talents more to make teammates better, and not by asking, `Why
aren't you making that shot?''' Casey said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow Wilson offered a perspective on leadership at the
beginning of the century that Marbury and Johnson might consider at
the end. ``One cool judgment is worth a thousand hasty counsels,''
Wilson said. ``The thing to do is supply light and not heat.''  &QL;

EDITORIAL: PREVENTING FATAL MEDICAL ERRORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Dec. 1:
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine reported this week that between 44,000
and 98,000 hospital patients die each year because of medical
mistakes _ comparable, says Dr. Lucian Leape of Harvard, a
co-author of the report, to having three jumbo jets filled with
patients crash every two days.
</P>
<P>
   These frightening numbers have been known by medical researchers
for at least a decade. The startling conclusion from the report is
how easy it would be to correct many of the fatal errors. The
institute, an affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences, has
now put its authority behind specific corrective measures.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Chassin, another of the report's co-authors and a
professor of health policy at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New
York, says the report shows that hospitals are not as safe as most
Americans believe. According to unpublished data from Colorado and
Utah in 1992, about 3 percent of patients admitted to hospitals
suffered injuries from treatment, of which about 9 percent died.
About half of those injuries were preventable.
</P>
<P>
   Leape says the report's important message is ``to stop blaming
individuals and focus on hospital systems.'' Simple redesign of
procedures can prevent fatal errors. Pharmacists can prepare and
clearly label doses of drugs ahead of time, before doctors or
nurses make a mistake in dosage while scrambling to save the life
of a heart-attack patient. Computerized systems can identify
potentially fatal drug combinations before they are administered,
or remind physicians and nurses to take simple precautions against
blood clots in elderly patients.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends that a center for patient safety be
established within the Department of Health and Human Services to
collect and distribute information about medical errors and
error-prevention systems. The center would be comparable, in many
respects, to the federal agencies that monitor safety on the
airlines and in the workplace. The report also calls for mandatory
reporting of serious injuries and deaths caused by medical
mistakes. Until consumers, including large employers, know who
makes mistakes, they cannot demand better performance.
</P>
<P>
   The report makes an important distinction, however, in calling
for voluntary confidential reporting of less serious errors. The
committee recognizes that overzealous reporting of the mistakes of
individual doctors and nurses can backfire, driving them to hide
mistakes in order to save their careers and financial well-being.
Mistakes that are hidden are inevitably mistakes that will be
repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Millenson, author of a recent book on medical quality,
points out that ``the number one cause of medical mistakes is not
incompetence but confusion.'' He says that most treatment-related
errors are caused by poorly designed systems that lack ``safeguards
to protect against anything less than human perfection.'' The
institute report calls for the federal government to help hospitals
borrow good ideas that catch mistakes before they cause serious
harm. That way hospital care might become as injury-free as airline
travel.

EDITORIALL: THE MAYOR'S ABORTION STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Dec. 1:
</P>
<P>
   Most politicians try to sidestep issues that divide voters along
militant, angry lines. But New York City's mayor, Rudolph Giuliani,
firmly rejected that kind of evasion when asked about late-term
abortions during a trip to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said, with no apparent qualifier, that he did not plan
to change his current position in favor of abortion rights to suit
the leadership of New York's Conservative Party. Its chairman is
calling on Giuliani to join other well-known Republicans in
endorsing a ban on the late-term procedures that they refer to as
partial birth abortions. But the mayor has steadfastly refused to
alter his support of abortion rights. He did so again Monday in the
company of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, with whom he disagrees on
this issue.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the mayor's stand particularly stalwart is that it
could easily jeopardize his nomination by the Conservative Party of
New York state. No Republican has won a statewide election in the
last 25 years without the Conservative Party line on the ballot, a
position that generally carries from 200,000 to 350,000 votes. If
the expected race between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Giuliani
tightens, those votes would look even sweeter than they do already.
The Conservative Party chairman, Michael Long, vows that he will
not bargain on the issue. Long is even threatening to bring out an
``aggressive'' candidate to run on the Conservative line unless the
mayor changes his mind and agrees to endorse a ban on late-term
abortions. This extra candidate would surely siphon votes away from
Giuliani and help Mrs. Clinton's chances.
</P>
<P>
   Once next year's Senate campaign is in full throttle, Long may
view things differently. Giuliani may eventually make a courtesy
visit to the Conservatives and try to persuade them to respect
either his principled stand or, at least, the political realities.
But the Giuliani camp said that his basic position would not be
compromised, making this a case in which the mayor's stubborn
streak is well deployed. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore asserted Tuesday that the
nation's prosperity was the central imperative of his campaign, and
he gave credit to President Clinton _ and himself _ for the booming
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this campaign for president, economic policy should be
front and center,'' Gore told a group of business executives here
Tuesday morning, as he allied himself fully with the president
whose shadow he has otherwise been trying to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton has presided over an economic policy in the
current administration that has been historic in its realism about
what works and what doesn't work,'' Gore said, ``and I'm proud to
have been a part of the deliberations that have helped to set this
economic policy in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's comments were his strongest about his role in the current
prosperity, and the remarks were striking in their full embrace of
Clinton. Far from separating himself from the president, as he has
been doing so frequently, Gore praised him often and used the word
``we'' to describe the administration's economic successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know that I am determined to continue the
prosperity and to continue the policies that have worked to build
that prosperity,'' he said, pledging that as president he would
invest in public education and job training for workers.
</P>
<P>
   In his talk to the business group, he promised to reduce the
deficit ``every single year'' of his presidency. Background papers
issued by his staff said that he pledged to ``make certain that
America stays on the path to be debt-free by 2015,'' but he did not
say that to this audience.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Gore, who suffered some embarrassment this
year when he took credit for the development of the Internet, said
he was the one who had first drawn attention to the toxic
contamination of Love Canal. He was telling a school audience that
each person can make a difference in the world and he recalled a
young person's writing to him when he was in Congress about a
hazardous-waste site in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   He then added: ``I found a little place in upstate New York
called Love Canal. I had the first hearing on that issue and Toone,
Tennessee,'' he said. ``But I was the one that started it all. And
it all happened because one high school student got involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore held congressional hearings on the matter in October 1978.
But two months earlier President Carter had declared Love Canal a
disaster area, and the federal government, after much howling by
local residents, had offered to buy the homes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was not available to answer questions from reporters after
he made the statement.
</P>
<P>
   In his economic speech Gore also discussed his little-known work
as a real estate developer in the early 1970s in Daleville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a brief time I was a home builder, after I came back from
Vietnam,'' he told the audience. ``Tipper and I borrowed some money
and bought 20 acres on the edge of the town where we lived and made
it into a subdivision, 35 lots, and I had a partner who built
several homes and then sold the rest of the lots. I know a good bit
about how to make money that way _ that was our nest egg. To build
this country is a great thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Peace and prosperity are traditionally overriding issues in
national elections, but mostly when they are threatened. Gore's
advisers said he had not focused on prosperity until now because
the economy was humming and voters were more concerned about
education, health care and school safety.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore has been preoccupied over the last several months with
the mechanics of his campaign and changing his image. And Tuesday's
assertion was as much a declaration that he wanted to turn the
conversation to the pocketbook issues that voters focus on
increasingly as an election approaches. As one adviser put it, Gore
deserved some credit for the nation's prosperity and he planned to
take it.
</P>
<P>
   But claiming credit for the economy has its hazards. It directly
links him with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Wittman, an analyst at the conservative Heritage
Foundation, said in a telephone interview that Gore's taking credit
for the economy illuminated both the cloud and the silver lining of
being vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is going to take credit for the good, he has to take the
bad with it,'' Wittman said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how responsible a president is for the economy
is always an open one; a vice president's share is even more open.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reischauer, the former director of the Congressional
Budget Office, appointed by Democrats, and now an analyst at the
Brookings Institution, said the Clinton administration had made
``some very gutsy decisions'' that helped vanquish the deficits,
and that Gore was influential in those decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore was known as a voice of moderation and perseverance when
it came to deficit reduction,'' Reischauer said, ``and he was on
the side of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reischauer added, ``There were a lot of other factors, not
the least of which was Lady Luck.''

HUNT FOR GRAVES DISRUPTS QUIET DESERT COUNTRYSIDE

<P>
   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico _ Brenda Balandran clutched her infant son
and stared at the masked men in black with rifles dangling at their
sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hard to believe,'' she said. ``Imagine all this going
on in such a peaceful place.''
</P>
<P>
   Balandran, who lives in Juarez, was one of many stunned by
reports that Mexican and U.S. authorities were searching for a mass
grave on a ranch south of the city. Based on an informant's tip,
officials suspect several ranches near Juarez may be the burial
site of scores of bodies, possibly victims of drug-related
violence.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation continued on Tuesday, the tranquility of
the Chihuahuan Desert landscape was broken by swarms of Mexican
federal agents patrolling the area around the ranch where heavy
equipment was being used to search for bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, a steady stream of trucks and buses passed
on the two-lane highway in front of the ranch, known as Club
Cazadores de Juarez. Children in school buses waved and smiled,
while whole families pulled their cars to the roadside and watched
for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Balandran, 21, was making her weekly visit to see family in the
country when she came upon the scene. She said she expects things
like this in the city, but not in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Juarez, you can't go out at night any more and drugs are
everywhere,'' she said. ``We just stay inside after dark, but here
we're out in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the search for bodies did not shock everyone, however.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Magallanes stood on a pile of rocks and watched the frenzy
from the auto parts yard where he works across the street from the
ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that surprised,'' said Magallanes, 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the drug capital of the border. The stuff comes
straight from Colombia through here and then to the United
States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Magallanes lives and works only feet from the ranch's
iron gates that were heavily guarded on Tuesday, he said he is not
afraid and does not own a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many poor people in the campo,'' he said. ``Many of
them work on these ranches and I don't fear them.''
</P>
<P>
   In front of their agriculture products store just yards from the
ranch entrance, Cruz Martinez Gamboa and Jesus Cruz Pinon shielded
their eyes from the bright sun as black government helicopters
swooped down over the desert. For them, the massive investigation
was a stark contrast to the usually peaceful life in the rolling
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live right here and I've never seen anything suspicious,''
Martinez Gamboa said. ``Life here is pretty simple and we don't get
a lot of action.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez Gamboa said that although she has lived in the area for
nearly a year, after moving from the Mexican state of Durango, she
has never met the family who lived and worked on the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep to myself, don't go out much, and I don't have
electricity for a television set,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As the setting sun cast flares of soft color across the sky,
Magallanes continued watching from his perch as news media camped
out in front of the ranch gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the media being here is good,'' he said. ``The world
has to know what goes on out here.''

WHAT HURT UCLA IN '99 COULD BOLSTER IT IN 2000
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What was a curse now becomes a blessing for UCLA's
reeling, beaten football team.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 season, framed by injuries and the handicapped-parking
scandal, was a three-month test of resolve. But the Bruins didn't
have enough upperclassmen to face the challenge alone. Instead,
they trotted out freshmen and sophomores and asked them to play
like veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The results were predictable: inconsistency, doubt,
disappointment and the program's worst record (4-7) in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But when those same players report for spring practice in April,
and for training camp in August, they'll be a year wiser and, the
coaches hope, a year better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be young and inexperienced, and I'm looking forward
to that,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said a few days after the loss to
USC.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the depth chart will ooze sophomores and juniors _
players with enough experience to hold leads, win close games and
win on the road, something the '99 Bruins didn't do.
</P>
<P>
   The depth chart will ooze players who should, in theory, know
their assignments so well they don't think, they simply react. Time
and again, the '99 Bruins wasted precious seconds analyzing, not
attacking.
</P>
<P>
   The depth chart will ooze players who should, in theory, be
strengthened by the failures of '99. It can't get much worse than
the 48-point loss at Oregon State, the shutout against Cal, or the
loss to USC that ended the Bruins' eight-game city series winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Will a veteran lineup translate into a Pac-10 title or top-10
ranking? It's too early to tell _ nine months too early. The answer
should come Sept. 2, when Alabama visits the Rose Bowl. If not,
then certainly two weeks later, when Michigan arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Given reasonable talent and myriad returnees, the natural
progression from 4-7 is probably 7-4, maybe 8-3. But nine wins
seems a bit much for the Bruins next season, considering their
schedule and unanswered personnel questions:
</P>
<P>
   _Will the injured/suspended players be ready?
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins played most of '99 without two of their top players:
receiver Brian Poli-Dixon (broken wrist) and cornerback Jason Bell
(post-surgical pain in his heel). In addition, receiver Freddie
Mitchell was a step slow (preseason cartilage damage in his knee),
and cornerback Marques Anderson was suspended from school for the
fall quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For the Bruins to thrive next year, Mitchell and Poli-Dixon must
make big plays, Bell and Anderson must prevent them.
</P>
<P>
   _A quarter (back) for your thoughts?
</P>
<P>
   Cory Paus and Ryan McCann, both sophomores-to-be, will compete
for the starting quarterback job in spring practice. Chances are,
Toledo won't name a starter until August, forcing both to work hard
through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The season could hinge on the outcome. If McCann's the winner,
is he destined to repeat Paus' mistakes? After all, McCann started
one game and threw just 63 passes, which means he'll be more a
freshman than a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll be a little beyond that,'' Toledo said. ``He's
been in the program two years, and he's seen some game action.''
</P>
<P>
   _Line them up and turn them loose?
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line is loaded with prep All-Americans who
probably will form a superb college line one day. But which day?
The Bruins had so many breakdowns in '99 it's hard to imagine them
without glitches next season.
</P>
<P>
   The difference could be dependency. In '99, with a rookie
quarterback and injuries to Poli-Dixon, Mitchell, Danny Farmer and
DeShaun Foster, the Bruins didn't have enough playmakers to
compensate for the young line.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, if Foster, Mitchell and Poli-Dixon are healthy, there
won't be as much pressure on the line to make every block and
execute every assignment. It'll be older and have more margin for
error.
</P>
<P>
   _Will the secondary become primary?
</P>
<P>
   With second-team all-conference end Kenyon Coleman and gifted
linebacker Robert Thomas, the Bruins have the makings of a solid
front seven. But without improvement from the porous secondary, the
linemen and linebackers won't have much chance to show their stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Anderson and Bell will help tremendously, and
don't be surprised if Anderson moves to safety to accommodate
talented freshman cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. That leaves Lovell
Houston, Jason Stephens and Audie Attar to fill the remaining
safety spot. If someone emerges, the secondary should be solid.
</P>
<P>
   So that's it. Four concerns for spring practice, and one
question for next season:
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be better in the fall,'' Toledo said, ``but whether
we're ready to take a giant step, I don't know.''

MISSOURI BILL WOULD OPEN CHILD-ABUSE RECORDS TO REPORTERS,
CAREGIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONNA McGUIRE and WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A bill to be introduced Wednesday in the
Missouri General Assembly would, for the first time, provide
limited public access to state child-abuse records and would allow
lawsuits against the Division of Family Services when workers are
found negligent in cases where children have died or been seriously
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Harry Wiggins, a Kansas City Democrat, plans to submit the
bill in Jefferson City on Wednesday, the opening filing day for the
2000 legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was drafted in response to the October deaths of Larry
and Gary Bass. The 8-year-old Kansas City brothers died from
starvation and infected burns, even though teachers for years had
reported the children's plight to the state's child-abuse hot line.
Just two months before the boys died, a relative also called the
hot line.
</P>
<P>
   At least three Division of Family Services workers were
suspended 20 days for failing to properly do their jobs after the
final hot-line call. The boys' mother, Mary Bass, 31, faces charges
of second-degree murder and child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with the torture and murder of two innocent
8-year-old boys,'' Wiggins said. ``We are trying to stop that from
happening again.''
</P>
<P>
   He said more deaths might be prevented if child-abuse workers
know that news media have access to investigation records. Wiggins
plans to ask Gov. Mel Carnahan today to release the Bass records to
the media immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Division of Family Services staff members, he said, ``are
working at public expense, and taxpayers are paying their salaries.
I don't see why they should be so afraid of letting the press and
public know what they are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders expect child abuse to be a key topic at the
2000 session. And Wiggins' bill may not be the only one addressing
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan on Thursday is expected to announce 30 policy and
legislative recommendations from Missouri's Child Fatality Task
Force, which the governor appointed last year. The task force
deliberated three months before drafting its recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Stangler, the director of the Missouri Department of Social
Services, deferred comment on Wiggins' bill until he saw Carnahan's
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri law now makes it a misdemeanor to release child-abuse
investigation reports to unauthorized people. The law is designed
to protect families and children named in reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Division of Family Services has cited the law in refusing to
release the Bass records. Critics complain that the law allows the
division to hide internal problems.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 states have relaxed child-abuse confidentiality laws in
recent years, though not as far as Wiggins proposes. Most of those
states allow records to be opened after abused children have died
and have no surviving siblings. In Missouri, the Jackson County
prosecutor's office supports opening child-abuse records after
children's deaths. Stangler previously said he favors such a
change, too.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins' bill would do more. It would give the media access to
files after the Division of Family Services has found that abuse
occurred and entered the record into a central registry. There is
no threshold on the seriousness of the abuse and no waiting until
children die. The media would have to know a child's name to
request his or her file.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Wiggins' bill also would expand access to schools,
day-care centers, foster parents and others who supervise or have
custody of children. Caregivers and teachers then would know what
has happened to children and would be better able to watch for
subsequent signs of abuse, Wiggins said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one advocate for children disagrees with releasing the
full report to schools or day-care centers. It would be more
helpful if the Division of Family Services shared key information
with those people and enlisted their support in monitoring
children, said Linda Spears, child protection director for the
Child Welfare League of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just having the (record) information does not help you do
anything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At least two states, Florida and Washington, allow caseworkers
to be sued if children die and the workers are found negligent,
Spears said. In most states, including Missouri and Kansas, workers
are protected against such lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins' bill would allow lawsuits when a child's situation had
been reported at least twice to the state, the child then dies or
is seriously injured, and ``negligent supervision'' of Division of
Family Services workers is found to have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leader Delbert Scott of Lowry City criticized
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are never going to stop crazy people from doing awful
things,'' Scott said, adding the state should ``look to the person
responsible for causing the deaths and be unmerciful'' in holding
them accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Making Division of Family Services workers legally liable for
deaths or injuries would make it difficult to fill those jobs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't work in a situation like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins plans to start seeking co-sponsors for his bill today
and expects to find broad support.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing bad that can come out of this, only good,''
said Democratic Rep. Henry Rizzo of Kansas City, who will sponsor
Wiggins' bill in the House. ``I don't think anybody with a
reasonable mind will object to the light being shone on this.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Steve Gaw, a Moberly Democrat who has sponsored
key child-care bills in recent years, endorses greater access to
Division of Family Services records. Those records are shrouded far
too often now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are going to be a lot of hard questions asked
during the legislative session about the case in Kansas City,'' he
said. ``It will be one of the priorities as far as I am
concerned....The key is at what point in time the case is
substantiated and how much of that information should be
released.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaw said he was unsure whether efforts to loosen legal
protection when children die or suffer serious injury would be
approved. He noted that a bill that raised the state's legal
liability limits this year won approval despite the controversy it
created.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Pro Tem Ed Quick, a Liberty Democrat, said
allowing the state to be sued in cases where a child dies or
suffers serious injury ``might happen'' but the issue would trigger
extensive debate.
</P>
<P>
   Quick said that opening Division of Family Services
investigative records was ``a very touchy situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to be so careful with those records that you
don't put out something publicly that shouldn't be put out,'' he
said.

RESTORATION OF KANSAS CAPITOL IN EARLY STAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ These days at the Capitol, it is common to spot
workers dangling from ropes from the dome, standing on scaffolding
in the Senate chamber or crouched in the building's elevator
shafts.
</P>
<P>
   They are all part of the early stages of what is expected to be
an extensive restoration program for the 96-year-old French
Renaissance building, the seat of Kansas government.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the craftsmen in recent weeks has been a cadre of
architects, preservationists and system specialists. They have been
examining every detail of the building, work that eventually will
lead to creation of a historic- structure report.
</P>
<P>
   That document, to be completed in March, will provide guidelines
for restoring the limestone Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers led by Senate President Dick Bond, an Overland Park
Republican who is chairman of the Capitol Restoration Commission,
are beginning to explore sources of money to support the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it's going to cost, but it's going to be
big,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is to use part of the $70 million the state is
holding in its the unclaimed property account, money that Kansans
have lost track of. Interest earned on the money also could be used
to finance a bond issue.
</P>
<P>
   A $45 million bond issue could be supported by draining off $4
million a year from the account over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Groth, the Capitol architect, said it was difficult to come
up with accurate cost estimates, particularly when no one knew for
sure just what would be found once major renovations began.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's dollars, and not knowing exactly what we will be
doing: $80 million,'' Groth estimated. ``It could be less; it could
be more.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar Capitol projects are in various stages of completion
across the country and with widely varying costs. For example:
Texas, $180 million; Iowa, $59.5 million; Idaho, $40 million to $50
million; and Ohio, $112 million.
</P>
<P>
   State Treasurer Tim Shallenburger, the former House speaker who
was an early supporter of revamping the neglected Capitol, told
lawmakers that it was time to get on with the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time to fix the roof is when it leaks, not when there's
money,'' he said.

PAID LEAVE FOR NEW PARENTS TOPS ISSUES IN CLINTON SPEECH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton announced new rules Tuesday to
allow states to offer paid leave to new parents and marked the
anniversary of a landmark gun-control measure by urging Congress to
do more.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tackled several domestic issues before flying to Seattle
for the contentious World Trade Organization session.
</P>
<P>
   The president first flew to San Francisco where he helped
Democrats raise campaign contributions and later to Los Angeles
where he helped raise money for the Center to Prevent Handgun
Violence and the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Washington, the president said he had signed an
executive order that would allow states to use unemployment
insurance to provide paid leave to new parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this act, the United States joins the rest of the world's
advanced economies, all of whom already have some form of paid
leave for parents,'' Clinton said, surrounded by parents and
children in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the program would be voluntary for states.
</P>
<P>
   ``State flexibility and the voluntary nature of this effort are
key to its success,'' Clinton said. ``In our strong economy, we
hope states will take advantage of this new option, and we believe
those that do will balance this new benefit with the imperative of
maintaining a fiscally sound unemployment insurance program.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, during his first year in office, sponsored legislation
providing up to one-year unpaid leave for employees with ailing
family members or new children. The president said an estimated 20
million people have taken up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to be with
newborns or sick relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the current law meets just a fraction of the need. And the
number one reason families give for not taking advantage of Family
and Medical Leave is that they simply can't afford to take time off
without a paycheck,'' Clinton said. ``The actions we take today
will go a long way toward alleviating that burden if the states
take up the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, Clinton also marked the sixth anniversary of the
passage of the Brady Law, the measure named for former press
secretary James Brady who was injured during the 1981 assassination
attempt on Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also released new figures showing 160,000
people were barred from purchasing handguns under the instant
background check system that took affect a year ago. There were 8.7
million background checks in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on Congress to make passage of more gun-control
legislation the first priority when it returns in January.
</P>
<P>
   He said Congress failed to pass ``common sense measures'' such
as extending background checks to gun shows, banning juvenile
offenders from possessing guns when they turn 21, mandating child
safety locks be sold with every handgun and banning the importance
of high-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also announced Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will
launch ``Online LEAD,'' a new crime fighting technology to help
trace weapons. The program will provide every Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms field office with instant access to 1 million
gun traces.

FTC STAFF SEEKS TO BLOCK BP AMOCO-ARCO MERGER; EXXON-MOBIL UNION
COMPLETED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Alaska, Texas, N.H., Conn.)   (SUBS 3rd graf of 2nd take to CORRECT spelling of BENICIA)  
(Exclusive) 
(js) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The staff of the Federal Trade Commission has
concluded that the proposed $29 billion merger between BP Amoco and
Atlantic Richfield violates antitrust law and has recommended that
the full commission block the deal, two people who have been
briefed about the decision said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation was based on concerns that the merger could
result in significantly higher gasoline prices in California and
the West. Those states are supplied with crude oil from the North
Slope of Alaska, where exploration and production are dominated by
BP Amoco and ARCO.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the two companies agree to significant new conditions or
divestitures to satisfy the federal government that there would be
enough competition on the West Coast for crude oil, the
recommendation threatens to kill the deal. Last May, when the
agency's staff recommended that it block Barnes &AMP; Noble's $600
million bid for Ingram Book Group, that deal collapsed within three
days.
</P>
<P>
   The BP Amoco-ARCO decision was disclosed the same day that Exxon
and Mobil completed the largest industrial merger in history after
the commission approved that deal and ordered those companies to
sell $2 billion to $3 billion worth of gas stations, pipelines,
terminal ports and a refinery.
</P>
<P>
   While the divestiture is the largest ever ordered by the FTC, it
represents a fraction of the combined companies' assets.
</P>
<P>
   That $81 billion merger combines the nation's two largest oil
companies into a new energy behemoth, which reported a combined
$146 billion in revenue last year, the third largest behind General
Motors and DaimlerChrysler. It also reunites two of the biggest
chunks of the old Standard Oil empire created by John D.
Rockefeller Sr., which was broken up in 1911 for violating federal
antitrust law. (Exxon is the successor of Standard Oil of New
Jersey, while Mobil was once Standard Oil of New York.)
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 4-0, the FTC approved the Exxon-Mobil settlement
Tuesday morning, a day before the first anniversary of the
announcement by the two companies that they planned to merge. Soon
after the vote, executives disclosed that they had formally closed
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of BP Amoco and ARCO, the agency's procedures give
lawyers for the two companies an opportunity to brief the
commission and offer further concessions. A spokesman for BP Amoco
said Tuesday that he expected that the companies and the FTC would
ultimately reach an agreement and that the deal could close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discussions continue with the Federal Trade Commission,'' said
the spokesman, Ronnie Chappell. ``We're confident that we will find
an outcome that's satisfactory to BP Amoco, ARCO and the
commission.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The discussions between government officials and the companies'
antitrust lawyers have centered on the Alaskan market for crude oil
and whether the merger would result in too much concentration for
California and the West. Prices of gasoline in California have been
rising sharply higher than the national average _ 26.3 cents a
gallon higher for regular grade _ and a new study completed last
week by the California attorney general concluded that the relative
lack of competition had been a primary cause of price increases
this year.
</P>
<P>
   A chief problem, the study concluded, was that only six refiners
control more than 90 percent of the capacity in California and also
own the majority of gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   But executives at BP Amoco and ARCO say that there is little
overlap of their operations on the West Coast and that any
concentration of crude oil production in Alaska has been resolved
by a preliminary agreement with the state calling for the companies
to sell 13 percent of their oil production from the North Slope to
other companies. That deal will reduce the combined control of
production to about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Federal and many state officials said Tuesday that they were
confident that the divestitures by Exxon and Mobil would continue
to preserve competition in the oil industry, although the deal will
make it harder for BP Amoco and ARCO to obtain permission for their
merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every deal has to be examined on its own merits,'' Robert
Pitofsky, the chairman of the FTC, said in an interview Tuesday
afternoon. ``But we are quickly approaching the point where given
the trend toward even greater concentration, we are committed to
giving even more scrutiny of the deals that are proposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky declined to discuss the BP Amoco-ARCO merger, which
remains under review, but he said the closing of the Exxon
acquisition was certain to affect other pending deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they certainly have an impact, and I have to be upfront
about that,'' he said. He also said the spate of oil mergers over
the last few years had begun to move the industry ``from moderate
levels of concentration to high levels of concentration'' and that
``we're beginning to approach the limit.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   These are the main assets that Exxon and Mobil agreed to sell
over the next nine to 12 months to gain approval from the federal
government:
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 2,400 gas stations throughout the nation, including
1,740 in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, 360 in California
and 319 in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exxon's Benicia refinery in northern California.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mobil's terminal operations in Boston and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mobil's 11 percent interest in the Colonial pipeline, which
runs from Louisiana to Washington, D.C., and its 3 percent interest
in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.
</P>
<P>
   _ A quantity of paraffinic lubricant base oil, used to help
create many of the world's lubricants, which would be the
equivalent to Mobil's North American market share.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exxon's jet-turbine oil business.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, Exxon-Mobil must also guarantee that
it will supply 100,000 barrels a day of Alaska crude oil to the
Benecia plant to help keep prices competitive in California, said
Bill Lockyer, California's attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer and representatives from 12 other states and Washington,
D.C., joined Tuesday's agreement with the federal government. But
two states, New Hampshire and Connecticut, pointedly did not agree
to the terms of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This huge combination may harm consumers, hamstring
competition and threaten dealers,'' said Richard Blumenthal, the
Connecticut attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said that Connecticut could not block the merger but
remained deeply concerned about the treatment of hundreds of gas
station owners and operators who may now have to give up their
stations as part of the divestiture or who could be forced into
onerous new station leasing and gasoline pricing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon and Mobil have been conducting bids for the stations but
have not said what will happen to the existing dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement announced Tuesday, the FTC has the
authority to approve or veto all the purchasers of the stations.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said that Blumenthal ``was absolutely right'' to be
concerned about the fate of the owners and operators of the
stations, and that the commission would closely examine the
business plans of all prospective buyers to see how they treated
the dealers. &QL;

HUSBAND OF KANSAS CITY'S MAYOR REGAINING STRENGTH AND SPIRIT AFTER
LATEST ROUND OF CHEMOTHERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE and LYNN HORSLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A week ago Tuesday at the Chamber of
Commerce's annual dinner, Frank Barnes did what some people say he
does best: worked a room.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in what he calls his dark ``IBM'' suit and red power
tie, the husband of Kansas City's mayor pumped hands, made small
talk and laughed a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a pretty gregarious guy,'' Barnes said later. ``That guy
was back.''
</P>
<P>
   And what a comeback it was from just a few months ago when
Barnes, 74, was undergoing yet another round of chemotherapy for
the cancer that has ravaged him off and on since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   During his chemotherapy treatments this summer, he dropped 20
pounds, although he never lost his hair. At times, a constantly
fatigued Barnes was too weak to answer the door.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, a long time ago for a cancer survivor such as
Barnes, who strives to live one day at a time.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, Barnes was feeling good as he escorted his wife to
the Hyatt Regency ballroom and mingled with the likes of Missouri
Gov. Mel Carnahan and U.S. Sen. Kit Bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can work a room,'' Barnes quipped, ``almost as good as she
can.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kay Barnes took office in April, she knew she would be
dealing with deteriorating bridges, budget woes and scads of
mayoral appointments.
</P>
<P>
   But then, on top of those demands, came news of the reoccurrence
of her husband's cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Barnes defeated George Blackwood to become the
city's first woman mayor, Frank Barnes received an ominous report
about suspicious bumps in his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   In early May came another jolt. A bone scan revealed three
cancerous ``hot spots'' in his hip and both arms. Radiation
treatment followed, as did rigorous weeks of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, something positive. In August, scans showed shrinkage
in the tumors in his lungs and last month doctors said no new
lesions were forming in his liver and kidneys. His bones were
healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all very good news,'' Frank Barnes said recently, in
his first interview on his health. ``The doctor was ecstatic. I'm
feeling a lot like my old self.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I'm not out of the woods yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay Barnes insists that her husband's roller-coaster medical
ride has had little effect on her work as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say this (illness) has not in my opinion
interfered with that,'' she said about her mayoral duties. ``Yes,
it is stressful. But Frank is the healthiest person I've ever known
emotionally. And so he is very straightforward and realistic about
what he's dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the same token, he lives day by day and is, by nature,
optimistic. So that mitigates the stress a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   She typically works full time during the workweek and at least
part of the day on Saturdays and Sundays. Barnes, 61, says she's
missed only two days since taking office.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the mayor found that she had even more time for City
Hall work because her husband couldn't carry on an active social
life.
</P>
<P>
   By her count, in the fewer than 200 days she's been in office,
Barnes has met with more than 200 groups, nearly 300 individuals,
spoken at or participated in at least 200 events, and had 60-plus
meetings with the media.
</P>
<P>
   But she's made some concessions, such as sometimes leaving
evening banquets early so that she can be at home. Or skipping
out-of-town conferences, such as the June meeting of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Close associates agree that her husband's cancer has not had a
major effect on her mayoral performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time you have a family illness, it has an
impact,'' said Mike Burke, a Kansas City lawyer and informal
adviser to the mayor. ``Is it of great concern? Obviously. Has it
had a visible impact on the way she conducts business at City Hall?
Not that I can detect.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke said Barnes ``keeps herself on a pretty even keel and
doesn't show a lot of her emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   For Frank Barnes, life with cancer has meant an endless
succession of visits to doctors in Arizona, Missouri and
Massachusetts and a lingering sense of uncertainty. He's received
conflicting diagnoses. The best guess now is that he has melanoma,
an aggressive skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   His battle with the disease began shortly before he married the
former Kay Waldo. In 1988, Frank Barnes had a small lesion removed
from his stomach that turned out to be a rare form of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, Frank Barnes noticed a bump on the back of
his head, just under the hairline. A piece of his scalp was
removed. The diagnosis: A slow-growing sarcoma, a malignant tumor.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, Barnes had a cancerous growth on his hip
removed. In June 1998, he noticed a new bump at the base of his
neck. The bump was removed, but not before doctors found that the
cancer had spread to lymph nodes in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   More surgeries followed, then radiation treatment, and more
surgery for new stomach lesions.
</P>
<P>
   Then came several months of relative calm as his wife battled
her way through the mayoral primary and ultimately, on March 30, an
easy win over Blackwood.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before March 30, Frank Barnes got the news about the
suspicious growths on his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Barnes said she realized a few years ago that she had to
choose between living her life in fear, or ``staying in the present
and literally taking it one day at a time, and living in that
day.'' She chose the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to describe,'' the mayor said of living with the
ever present knowledge of her husband's illness. ``But my
experience is that once you make that decision that you're going to
take it only a day at a time, it changes a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Being mayor allows Barnes to focus her energies in an outward
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's good for me, because otherwise I might be obsessing
in a way that would not be helpful to either Frank or me,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't go with Frank Barnes to the doctor. He prefers to go
alone.
</P>
<P>
   He's comfortable dealing with doctors and arcane medical
terminology because of his background as an Abbott Labs
pharmaceutical executive. He retired in 1993 and continues to work
occasionally as a business consultant, linking upstart biotech
companies with partners to give the companies firmer financial
footing.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Barnes' energy is now returning. He's started to exercise
again. He's begun to make the social rounds with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   That's important to her. She ranks him as one of her closest
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made an investment in her campaign, and I haven't realized
any return on that investment at all,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   That, he added, is about to change.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ Kwame Cavil is an All-Big 12 football player, without
question the best receiver in the conference.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is so talented that teams have tried every type of coverage
imaginable to try to slow him, but few, if any, have worked.
</P>
<P>
   Cavil is also an All-Big Talker, without question the best in
the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing Cavil's gift of gab, opponents have also given their
best effort in trying to slow the junior's verbal assault with a
barrage of trash talk early in games.
</P>
<P>
   But they have found out that is like trying to outswim a fish.
By the fourth quarter, Cavil has usually worn 'em down.
</P>
<P>
   After a daylong tete-a-tete with Cavil, Oklahoma State defenders
were reduced to the weakest of all comebacks in linguistic warfare:
``Man, you talk too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, opponents do not get too upset at Cavil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing is you don't push anybody's button to where
they hate you,'' Cavil said. ``They know it's part of the game.
When you play basketball or any other sport off the field, you're
going to trash-talk. That's the competitive nature, the competitive
joy you get out of playing this game. But after the game,
everybody's cool. It's not like it's a hatred thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Cavil and Texas fans are concerned, it's a love
affair. Cavil, who broke the Texas single-season receptions mark
weeks ago, is poised to become the first Longhorn to haul in 100
catches in a season. The Waco native has a Big 12-record 95
receptions for 1,098 yards, which is also a school mark.
</P>
<P>
   With nine catches in Saturday's Big 12 Championship Game against
Nebraska (he averages almost eight per game), Cavil would set a
Texas career receptions record, surpassing Michael Adams' mark of
177 set from 1992-96.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into the year wanting to set records,'' Cavil said.
``Those were goals of mine. One hundred receptions was a goal of
mine at the beginning of the season. I knew that if I had that type
of year, the team would do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavil may talk a lot, but he is just having fun playing the game
he loves, and opponents know it. Nebraska cornerback Ralph Brown,
who will face Cavil on Saturday, got a taste of what Cavil is like
when the Longhorns played the Cornhuskers on Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Brown, who has been named to several All-America
squads this season, came in prepared for the confrontation with the
Longhorns' on-the-field spokesman. During the week of the game,
Brown's All-America cohort in the Cornhuskers' self-billed
``Secondary to None,'' rover Mike Brown, said everyone on the
defense would be prepared to answer Cavil with words of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the student of trash talk, Cavil said he had noticed in
Nebraska game film that Ralph Brown wore a mouthpiece. Not so
against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came out there and didn't have one, so I knew he was going
to talk,'' Cavil said. ``I said, `You're not wearing a mouthpiece.
Is that any indication you're going to be talking to me the whole
game?' He said, `What do you think?'''
</P>
<P>
   As per his norm, Cavil got the last laugh, and word, against the
No. 3-rated pass defense in the country. He finished with eight
receptions for 84 yards and a touchdown in Texas' 24-20 win, the
third-ranked Cornhuskers' lone loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the third quarter, Cavil accounted for all 58 yards in a
touchdown drive that gave the Longhorns their first lead of the
game. It took three plays.
</P>
<P>
   Cavil lined up wide right and gained 18 yards on a deep in
pattern, beating cornerback Keyuo Craver. Following the play, Cavil
put a finger to his mouth, giving the ``shhh'' signal to the
sophomore from Harleton.
</P>
<P>
   Cavil lined up on the right side again, went in motion and beat
Craver once more on a corner route for a 27-yard gain to the
13-yard line. Cavil then delivered a stoic ``you can't hold me''
stare to a jabbering Craver.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Cavil lined up on the left side of the formation against
Ralph Brown and Nebraska's man-to-man coverage. He darted straight
ahead, fought off a chuck at the 10 and sliced in front of Brown to
grab a strike from Major Applewhite for the touchdown. This time,
however, Cavil didn't say anything after the play. He didn't have
to. He did his talking before it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `I'm going to the end zone on this play, and I'm
going right past you.' I told him the play and everything,'' Cavil
said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis may not want Cavil
sharing play information with defenders, but sometimes the
confident 6-2, 205-pounder can't help himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one thing I admire about him _ his confidence,'' said
UT receiver Ryan Nunez, who with 53 receptions for 569 yards this
season has combined with Cavil to form the school's all-time top
pass-catching duo in receptions and second-best tandem in yards.
``He knows no one can stop him, and by the end of the game, they
know it too.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas' quarterbacks have confidence in Cavil as well.
</P>
<P>
   When Applewhite needs a completion, his first thought is to find
Cavil, because open or not, he'll likely make the catch.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman quarterback Chris Simms, who got his first start last
week against Texas A&AMP;M because Applewhite was ill, knew where to go
with the ball. Simms had eight completions in the first half
against the Aggies _ seven to Cavil.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the man,'' Simms said. ``He's great. You can't miss him.
You throw it high, throw it low, throw it too far, he's going to
catch it. I knew if I got it to him and got him into the game he
would make plays for me, too, and that's what I was looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what Cavil was looking for from himself entering the
season. He said he was ``champin' at the bit'' to take a leadership
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to put it on (my) shoulders, blame me for it,''
Cavil said. ``It's not having to be second fiddle to anybody, a
chance to control your own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Cavil has indeed been second fiddle to none.

TIME OF TRIAL BY TAUNT FOR WORLD TRADE CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, Switzerland _ It took nearly a year for Mike Moore, the
new director general of the World Trade Organization, to get the
job of running the 135-nation group. It could take just a few days,
during the organization's contentious meeting in Seattle, for him
to be judged a success or a failure.
</P>
<P>
   If the violent demonstrations and disruptions of the meeting's
opening day on Tuesday are any guide, Moore, a seasoned trade
negotiator who was briefly prime minister of New Zealand, is now
confronting the biggest challenge of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 50, is at the center of the trade meeting that is to
bring together President Clinton and top trade officials from the
member countries of the Geneva-based organization. The goal of the
meeting, now scheduled to run through Friday, is to gain sufficient
agreement among the members to support a new round of negotiations
aimed at opening global markets further.
</P>
<P>
   Most chief executives of international organizations are not
forced to think about their legacies so early in their terms. But
the combination of the divisive 10-month selection fight, which
delayed Moore's installation until September, and the urgent matter
of organizing the Seattle conference put great pressure on him.
</P>
<P>
   That pressure increased even more last week after the WTO failed
to come up with an agenda for Seattle. Moreover, much of the
attention surrounding that meeting has shifted to the demonstrators
who have descended on the city to protest what they see as lack of
concern by the trade group on the environmental, safety and labor
aspects of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Moore wields little decisive power because members can
ultimately defy WTO decisions. Yet he is the image maker for the
trade group, a particularly sensitive role since it has become the
lightning rod for criticism on matters as diverse as genetically
modified soybeans, child labor, endangered sea turtles and cheaply
sold steel.
</P>
<P>
   It was Moore's qualities as a communicator that persuaded
important trading nations, including the United States, to support
him for director general. ``You can see him going off to
Washington, sitting down with congressmen and convincing them with
his folksy way that the WTO isn't something monstrous,'' said a
trade diplomat in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Moore is not afraid of confrontation but prides himself on
listening to other viewpoints. He acknowledged Monday during a
meeting with WTO delegates in Seattle that the protesters had some
legitimate issues. He also got a dose of what the combative
atmosphere might be like in Seattle a few weeks ago in Geneva, when
a group of students bolted from a WTO meeting they had been invited
to attend, shredded the literature they had been given and chained
themselves to the grand staircase at the organization's
headquarters. Comrades unfurled banners across the building's
stately facade: ``The WTO Kills. Kill the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impolite and bad manners to chain yourself up, then ask
for an invitation to see me,'' Moore responded affably, but firmly.
</P>
<P>
   The son of New Zealand farmers, Moore has drawn on his
experiences as a construction worker, a meat-industry worker, a
printer and later a social worker to bolster his everyman persona.
Also a longtime politician and trade negotiator, Moore has said he
is a true believer in trade as a force for prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's at stake is jobs and an opportunity to raise living
standards for everybody,'' he frequently says.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, Moore has run into the reality that profound
differences among nations on important trade issues are threatening
to derail any new global negotiations _ part of the reason for the
WTO's existence. He has not been able to dislodge trading blocs
from entrenched positions. For example, the European Union has not
budged from the stance that farm products must be treated specially
because their production contributes to maintaining the rapidly
vanishing countryside _ a position viewed as pure protectionism by
countries like the United States. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the director has also received some good marks for his
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was incredibly patient,'' said Brazil's trade negotiator,
Celso Amorim.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's honest and he didn't try to play games with us,'' added
Nacer Benjelloun-Touimi, who represents Morocco at the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's built bridges, which is good,'' said Munir Akram,
Pakistan's representative. ``But he has to deliver in Seattle. I'm
convinced a director general can make a difference.'' Both Pakistan
and Morocco supported candidates other than Moore for the WTO's top
job.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome in Seattle, Moore will not lose his job,
get a promotion or have his pay cut. In the compromise that ended
the prolonged selection fight, he was appointed for a three-year
period, to be followed the next three years by his Thai rival for
the post, prompting irreverent WTO staffers to nickname him ``Demi
Moore.''

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Hardly a football game at any level of competition goes by without
at least a little trash-talking between opposing players.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kwame Cavil, an outstanding receiver from his first day at
Texas, is a junior academically. But it's alleged he could have
long ago earned a Ph.D. in talking smack.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska senior rover Mike Brown is among those who know
firsthand. Having played in the Cornhuskers' secondary for four
years, during which the Longhorns have beaten his team three
straight times, Brown has received more than an earful from Cavil
in the last two meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to talk a lot,'' Brown said. ``It keeps you involved
in the game. It's a heated competition out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of fun just to ride up against receivers like him
because you know he's a great player. He's going to test your
ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Cavil didn't have a big game statistically last year when
Texas rolled into Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, Major Applewhite
passed for 269 yards and two touchdowns en route to a 20-16 victory
that snapped Nebraska's 47-game home winning streak, then the
fifth-longest in NCAA history.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Cavil was on the receiving end of eight Applewhite
passes for 84 yards, including a third-quarter touchdown, as the
Longhorns beat the Cornhuskers 24-20 in Austin on Oct. 23. It
remains Nebraska's only loss of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Cavil will renew acquaintances Saturday at San
Antonio's Alamodome when the Cornhuskers, the Big 12's North
Division champions, and Longhorns, champions of the South, decide
the decade's final Big 12 football titlist.
</P>
<P>
   You can bet the farm that Brown comes away with singed earlobes,
regardless of the game's outcome. But the All-America candidate and
captain of Nebraska's last line of defense, who had a career-best
19 tackles during the Longhorns' win in 1998, apparently doesn't
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just stuff that goes on between football players all the
time,'' Brown said of his chats with Cavil. ``He's just one of
those guys who says, `You can't stop me,' things like that, normal
things anyone would say on the football field.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is the edited version of Cavil's game-day
verbal grab bag.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Cornhuskers' long home winning streak had been
scissored last year, trash-talking gave way to sportsmanship that
had Cavil a little surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny, because they kind of congratulated us, shook our
hands and said, `Good game,''' Cavil remembers. ``But they had that
wink in their eye like, `We're going to come back at you next
year.' But it was just a special victory for us when we went down
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could play Nebraska every game, anyone would love to do
that, just because of being an athlete and the competitive nature
of the sport. They're a great team, and (Brown is) a great player.
You know they're going to come ready to play this Saturday, and you
just have to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska posted a 33-30 overtime victory over archrival Colorado
in Boulder last Friday to finish the regular season 10-1 and ranked
No. 3 in the national polls. And though the Cornhuskers allowed the
Buffaloes to get back in the game with 24 fourth-quarter points,
Nebraska coach Frank Solich says this has been a season in which
Brown and the secondary have performed up to some very tall
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, sophomore free safety Dion Booker and cornerbacks Ralph
Brown, a senior (and no relation to Mike Brown) and Keyuo Craver, a
sophomore, were considered the strongest part of the team going
into the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great secondary for us throughout,'' Solich said.
``You can imagine in terms of experience and the quality of athlete
that we have here that there was a lot expected of them right out
of the blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they delivered immediately. They have played great
football. Certainly, a lapse in the last half, basically the last
quarter, of the Colorado game can be attributed to a lot of
different things. Overall, they have been just tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   The secondary cannot be singly blamed for the rally that brought
the Buffaloes from a 27-3 deficit to a 27-27 deadlock that
necessitated overtime. The Nebraska offense gained only 78 yards in
the second half and dogged itself with fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   But Colorado senior quarterback Mike Moschetti threw for three
touchdowns in the fourth quarter. That, Mike Brown said, burned the
pride of the Cornhuskers and will be a source of motivation
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, every game we want to go out and show our abilities,''
he said. ``We struggled (against Colorado), and we've struggled in
some other games. That's going to happen because we play so much
man-to-man. Sometimes you're going to get beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But definitely, they (the Longhorns) are awesome. They're a
challenge because they throw the ball very well. They've got two
capable quarterbacks, especially Major Applewhite. His poise and
leadership _ you can't deny what he can do for a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a great leader. You've got the (team) confidence
(bred from three straight wins over Nebraska) and that great
leadership. It just builds up, and it's a hard wall to break
down.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several Food and Drug Administration officials have
disagreed with the agency's conclusion that genetically engineered
foods can be regulated in the same way as conventional food
varieties, according to internal agency memorandums read Tuesday at
a public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   One of the memorandums, which were written in the early 1990s,
accuses the agency of siding with industry and giving short shrift
to consumers. An advocate of labels on genetically modified food,
Steven M. Druker, obtained the documents in a lawsuit and read them
at a hearing about the safety and labeling of such foods.
</P>
<P>
   The agency says there is no difference between foods modified by
genetics engineeering and foods modified by traditional breeding
practices. But it organized a series of three hearings to listen to
the public and a range of panelists on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Druker made public a 1992 memorandum from Dr. Linda Kahl, a
compliance officer, to Dr. James Maryanski, the agency's
Biotechnology Coordinator, that shows the range of views that
existed within the agency itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process of genetic engieneering and traditional breeding
are different, and according to the technical experts in the
agency, they lead to different risks,'' Dr. Kahl wrote. ``There is
no data that addresses the relative magnitude of risk _ for all we
know, the risks may be lower for genetically engineered foods than
for foods produced by traditional breeding. But the acknowledgment
that the risks are different is lost in the attempt to hold to the
doctrine that the product and not the process is regulated.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate memorandum, Dr. Louis Pribyl, an FDA
microbiologist, commenting on the draft of the Federal Register
notice on bioengineered foods, reiterated Dr. Kahl's point and
added that an agency document ``read very pro-industry, especially
in the area of unintended effects.'' It is ``industry's pet idea,''
he said that ``there are no unintended effects that will raise the
FDA's level of concern.'' But time and again, he said, ``there is
no data to back up their contention.''
</P>
<P>
   Pribyl also said the document ``contains very little input from
consumers and only a few answers for their concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryanski said in an interview that the concerns of agency
scientists were old news and that the comments the scientists made
were in response to an agency request for them. ``Those views were
taken into account,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The internal documents came to light because of a lawsuit filed
against the agency by the Alliance for Bio-Integrity, founded by
Druker, a lawyer who is the organization's executive director.
Druker is conducting a one-man campaign to force the agency to
institute mandatory, rigorous safety testing of all genetically
engineered food and require labeling. Safety testing and labeling
are now voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Druker, a panelist at the hearing Tuesday, was joined by Carol
Tucker Foreman, director of the Food Policy Institute of Consumer
Federation of America, and Dr. Rebecca Goldberg, a senior scientist
with the Envronmental Defense Fund, in calling for labeling and
testing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Goldberg said ``the agency has not squarely placed the
burden of proof on industry to demonstrate the safety of new food,
which had historically been required in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite rising public sentiment for more information about
bioengineered foods, which prompted the public hearings, Maryanski
said there was no reason to change the rules covering them. He
maintained that as long as developers of these foods ``follow the
agency's guidelines and do the testing that is recommended,''
though not required, genetically engineered foods were ``as safe as
any food on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this past year, Americans _ if they thought about
genetically engineered food at all, and most did not _ seemed
willing to leave these judgments to the agency. But all around the
globe, particularly in the European Union, consumers and activists
have opposed genetically modified food with such force that
American farmers have found those crops banned from some countries.
</P>
<P>
   Now many British supermarkets require labeling of genetically
modified products. The furious activity has finally had an effect
in this country and many of the questions that were not asked in
1992 are being asked now.
</P>
<P>
   The original decisions on how to regulate genetically altered
foods were made by the Bush White House. Vice President Dan Quayle
announced details of a government policy for steamlining regulation
of food produced through genetic engineering, saying that because
the United States ``was the world leader in biotechnology,'' the
government wanted ``to keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Foreman said in her remarks that the process of regulating
bio-engingeered food ``began under a cloud of political influence
peddling and managerial bean counting and the FDA has done nothing
to dispel that cloud.'' She said that both labeling and a mandatory
pre-approval process are essential. Several food trade associations
have told the agency the same thing. The Food Marketing Institute
and the Grocer Manufacturers of America said they ``believe a
mandatory consultation process would help ensure continued consumer
confidence in the FDA regulatory policy'' and that the agency
should set up criteria for labeling.

STARTLING ENDING FOR YOUNG WRITER OF PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Ky.) 
(jt) 
 By TINA KELLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As his first novel was being typeset, Robert Bingham,
33, was found dead in the bathroom of his TriBeCa home in lower
Manhattan on Sunday. A law enforcement official said that the
authorities believed that Bingham, the last male writer in the
storied and contentious Kentucky newspaper family, had overdosed on
heroin.
</P>
<P>
   It was a startling ending to a writing career with auspicious
beginnings. At 26, Bingham saw his first story published in The New
Yorker. His first book, a collection of short stories, was well
received, he married in May, and his novel, ``Lightning on the
Sun,'' was being compared to those of F. Scott Fitzgerald. He was
known for his reportorial portrayal of disaffected, burned out,
rich young men.
</P>
<P>
   A Kirkus review of his first book, ``Pure Slaughter Value''
(Doubleday, 1997), said Bingham's work ``at its best, stands out
for its precisely rendered and convincingly bleak view of life.''
</P>
<P>
   His death is the most recent in a string of family tragedies.
His father, Robert Worth Bingham III, the assistant publisher of
The Courier-Journal and The Louisville Times, was killed in a car
accident in 1966 when he was 34. Two years earlier, the novelist's
uncle, Jonathan Bingham, was electrocuted at a barn on the family's
Kentucky estate while trying to string lights for a Cub Scout
reunion party.
</P>
<P>
   Alex S. Jones, who, with Susan E. Tifft, chronicled the Bingham
family in ``The Patriarch: The Rise and Fall of the Bingham
Dynasty'' (Summit Books, 1991), remembered the younger Bingham's
efforts to find his place in a famous family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob was very young when his father died,'' Jones said, ``and
he seemed to be trying his whole life to live up to his father's
reputation, both for being a journalist and sort of a
swashbuckling, hell-raising, reckless adventurer, which his father
also had a fair portion of. Rob did a lot of things that made
people who knew him confused.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Bingham's told Jones how, while he was working in
Cambodia, Bingham would ride his motorcycle alone, late at night,
over roads that were thought to be controlled by the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't understand why he would take such a chance,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gerald Howard, Bingham's editor at Doubleday
Broadway, ``He'd seen something of the world on his journalistic
ticket, the way novelists in training used to.''
</P>
<P>
   This was unusual for writers Bingham's age, most of whom simply
come out of Masters of Fine Arts programs, Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham's agent, Jennifer Rudolph Walsh, vice president of the
Virginia Barber Literary Agency, said she and Howard had been
looking forward to working with him on future books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both thought we were at the beginning of something so
palpable and tremendous,'' Ms. Walsh said. ``And how did we know we
were at the end as well?''
</P>
<P>
   Bingham backed several artistic ventures, including Open City, a
literary magazine that he helped found.
</P>
<P>
   ``His community of people that he helped and cared about was
just really, really large,'' said Daniel Pinchbeck, editor, with
Thomas Beller, of Open City.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham gave money to a friend who is an artist to help her
finish her film, and he was generous with other friends who were
starting Web sites, said Pinchbeck, who last saw Bingham on
Thanksgiving night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed very sharp, very happy, very upbeat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An empty glassine envelope that had held heroin was found at his
side in the bathroom where his body was discovered, the law
enforcement official said. The medical examiner's office said the
determination of the cause of the death was pending histology and
toxicology tests, which will not be completed for up to two weeks.

A MERRY LITTLE LEGAL TANGLE: TEXAS HOMEOWNERS GROUP OBJECTS TO
ELABORATE CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC HANSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PECAN GROVE, Texas _ Children who see Steve Richardson's
elaborate Christmas display do more than ooh and aah.
</P>
<P>
   They stop. They get out of their cars, look at themselves on a
big-screen television and walk around, touching the animated toys
and dolls.
</P>
<P>
   It delights Richardson, but it does not delight the homeowners
association in this upscale northeast Fort Bend County subdivision
in suburban Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was working on the lavish display Tuesday with the
warning that it probably will lead to court action from the Pecan
Grove Plantation Property Owners' Association.
</P>
<P>
   Though the display has won several awards from the association
in years past, the group contends that it has become a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   Each year Richardson spends thousands of dollars and several
days putting up the elaborate prize-winning Christmas display at
his two-story home.
</P>
<P>
   ``His house would make Clark Griswold envious,'' said Steve
Broussard, his neighbor and attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Griswold is played by Chevy Chase in the 1989 movie ``Christmas
Vacation,'' and he covers his house in a blanket of blinking
lights.
</P>
<P>
   At the Richardson house, all the shrubs are covered in a mesh
lighting, and more lights hang from the second-floor eaves. Lights
also ring the yard.
</P>
<P>
   But the lights are just a start.
</P>
<P>
   Because the house is on the corner, he has plenty of yard space
to create a miniature Christmas theme park, including an artificial
skating rink complete with animated skaters.
</P>
<P>
   On one portion of his lawn he has a television camera pointed at
the street. The signal is fed into a giant television, allowing
people on the street and sidewalk to see themselves on the big
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said it is the TV screen and other features, such as
toy figures, dolls and a bubble machine, that cause people to stop
for a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the homeowners association sent Richardson a letter
saying his holiday decorations are so excessive they have become a
nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   The association said that unless he limits his display so that
sightseers are not encouraged to stop and walk about his property,
it will seek a temporary restraining order forcing him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that letter, Richardson said, he decided not to put
up his display this year.
</P>
<P>
   He changed his mind Saturday, though.
</P>
<P>
   First, two little girls stopped to ask whether he was going to
put out his decorations, and he said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `That's not fair. It's not Christmas without the
lights,''' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, he said, he was checking with neighbors to ask
if it would bother them if he put up the display again. He said he
knocked at one woman's door and asked her, and she began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked me inside, and she had about six Christmas trees
inside her house,'' Richardson said. ``She told me that she had
cancer and was undergoing treatments and she said, `I need your
lights to boost my spirits.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So we decided, let's go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, ``If my house is a nuisance, then so is every
other house in the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Broussard agrees that there are many houses in the subdivision
with elaborate displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the kids just love it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is the children's reactions that motivate Richardson,
who has a 21-year-old daughter and an 18-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk to the parents, they say they just love it,'' he
said. ``But, if you will watch the children, that is the big payoff
_ the squeals, the giggles. It is just awesome watching those
little kids. That is why I do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who owns several video stores, said the homeowners
association encourages residents to decorate their homes and that a
contest is held each year.
</P>
<P>
   He has lived in the subdivision seven years, four of those at
his present address, and won several awards for the decorations,
including first place awards in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Coveler, attorney for the homeowners association, said no
one is trying to keep Richardson from decorating his home for
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the very interactive things in his yard that
cause people to stop their cars, park and get out. This creates a
traffic hazard and other problems,'' Coveler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no other homes in the neighborhood that have
decorations that encourage people to stop and come onto the
property.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are singling me out,'' he said. ``There are other homes
out here that are interactive. People stop, get out and take
pictures. They have the same traffic problem that I have.''
</P>
<P>
   (This is not his first disagreement with the homeowners
association. The group is taking him to court Friday, seeking a
temporary restraining order because he stores a golf cart in his
back yard.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Richardson, all but two residents on the two
streets near his home have signed a petition saying his display is
not an annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Coveler said many residents have complained to the Sheriff's
Department about the traffic snarl around the Richardson house.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Amanda Ashley said she
could find no records of such complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that the complaints were made to us through the
association,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Coveler said the association had not taken any legal action
against Richardson because he was not finished installing his
decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Richardson was still putting on finishing
touches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you who should be complaining about me,'' he said. ``It
should be HL&AMP;P, because their stock will drop if I am not allowed
to do Christmas.''

 &HT;    DEMONSTRATORS THROWING WORLD TRADE SUMMIT INTO CHAOS
 &HT;    With CLINTON-WTO-1201.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Helmeted police backed by armored vehicles battled
tens of thousands of demonstrators for control of downtown Seattle
Tuesday, as protestors threw a global trade conference into chaos
and rocked this city with one of the nation's worst urban riots in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   As police fired pepper gas and rubber bullets at defiant throngs
of protesters, Mayor Paul Schell declared a state of civil
emergency and Gov. Gary Locke ordered hundreds of state police and
National Guard troops into the heart of downtown Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Schell declared this city's first curfew since Vietnam-war era
protests three decades ago and warned protesters that attempts to
disrupt a second day of proceedings on Wednesday would be met with
severity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be doing what it takes to make sure we've got a secure
downtown,'' a somber Schell told reporters at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Schell pleaded the demonstrators _ gathered here to protest a
conference of the World Trade Organization _ to stay off the
streets on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point's been made on these issues. It's been made
solidly,'' Schell said. ``Now help us and go home.''
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, just hours before President Clinton was due to
arrive to address delegates to a meeting of the 135-nation WTO, the
city was a darkened battleground.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators hurled rocks and bottles at lines of police in
riot gear, explosions echoed off of spiraling skyscrapers of
polished steel and glass and a helicopter cast a white searchlight
on crowds picking their way through broken glass, burning trash
bins and other debris of a day of rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of protesters held peaceful anti-WTO
demonstrations _ including a rally and march through the heart of
the city by labor unions _ throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Other protesters, however, grew violent.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen, dressed in dark hoods and face masks and
appearing to be protesting nothing in particular, stormed downtown
Seattle smashing windows in more than a dozen upscale department
stores and shops.
</P>
<P>
   Others blocked entry into the main WTO venue, forcing organizers
to delay for nearly six hours opening ceremonies for the largest
gathering of trade negotiators in history.
</P>
<P>
   Police threw a net around the downtown hotel where Clinton was
due to stay, circling two dozen city buses to cordon off the area
as riot police battled thousands of protesters less than two blocks
away.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes past 5 p.m. (PT), officials at the hotel Clinton
was to stay in made an unusual announcement _ in English followed
by Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a lock down situation. For your safety we would ask
that those of you who are guests in this hotel please go to your
rooms at this time,'' hotel officials announced. The hotel was the
seat of the U.S. trade delegation, led by U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to arrive here early Wednesday, where he
plans to address trade ministers from about 135 countries assembled
here to launch a new round of WTO negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a range of tensions resulting from the growth in
international trade. As the U.S. economy has become increasingly
linked to a global marketplace, scores of groups have rallied to
contend that the world trading system is placing profits ahead of
worker safety, the environment and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Seattle, where the WTO is meeting to launch an ambitious
round of negotiations aimed at setting the rules of global commerce
for the coming decade and beyond, environmental groups, organized
labor and others are using the event to draw a line in the sand
over world trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are helping us change the face of the global economy,''
John Sweeney, president of the giant AFL-CIO told a crowd and
estimated crowd of 35,000 at a labor rally at Memorial Stadium.
``Your presence here is proof that public opinion is fueling a
growing protest that has begun to speak to power.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, whose confederation of labor unions represents some 14
million organized workers, vowed to work to block any future trade
agreements that lack protections for workers and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will stop them,'' said Sweeney, whose constituents have
come under virulent wage and job pressures from low-cost imports
produced in countries where pay is a fraction of U.S. levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing here in Seattle is the beginning, the
beginning, of a fight we must carry to every level of government in
every country in the world,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO is an international tribunal that sets and enforces the
rules of the road in the global marketplace. If trade is the ship
powering one-sixth of the $30 trillion global economy, the WTO is
the system of buoys and navigational aides that guide it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the world's most powerful advocate of a strong WTO,
claims it has lent stability and predictability to a global trading
system that is creating hundreds of billions of dollars in new
wealth each year.
</P>
<P>
   That wealth, he contends, is helping to broaden the global
middle class, alleviate poverty and knit together a community of
nations tethered by commerce, not riven by contention.
</P>
<P>
   Its critics, though, say the WTO's enforcement powers give it
broad authority to supersede national laws, raising issues of
sovereignty and state control over the economic destiny of its
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anybody here vote to join the WTO? Anybody here paying
dues to the WTO,'' James Hoffa, president of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, asked the crowd at Tuesday's union rally.
``Then why don't we get the hell out of the WTO?''
</P>
<P>
   Rousing the crowd shortly before it held a peaceful, two-hour
march through Seattle, Hoffa drew enthusiastic cheers from
organized labor groups and others assembled on a sunny afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the ones that make the work, we are the ones that make
the profits,'' Hoffa thundered, ``and we are the ones that are
going to have a place at the table of the WTO, or we're going to
shut it down.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of high rhetoric. Air Line Pilots Association
president Duane Woerth even paraphrased Patrick Henry at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know not what course others may take,'' said Woerth, ``But
the Air Line Pilots Association isn't going to the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   Woerth said the WTO negotiators want to bring the civil aviation
industry _ worth, he said, $1 trillion a year worldwide _ under its
regulatory umbrella. That, said Woerth, would threaten unions like
the one he represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``People all over the world are getting hurt by the WTO and
their tactics,'' said Jay Boyle, 44, a telephone installer for US
West in nearby Vancouver, Wash., and a member of the Communications
Workers of America labor union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think workers in the United States understand labor
anger,'' Boyle said. ``Social unrest is something we haven't seen
since the 60s, and maybe it's time to get back to something like
that.''

</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the world's most powerful advocate of a strong WTO,
claims it has lent stability and predictability to a global trading
system that is creating hundreds of billions of dollars in new
wealth each year.
</P>
<P>
   That wealth, he contends, is helping to broaden the global
middle class, alleviate poverty and knit together a community of
nations tethered by commerce, not riven by contention.
</P>
<P>
   Its critics, though, say the WTO's enforcement powers give it
broad authority to supersede national laws, raising issues of
sovereignty and state control over the economic destiny of its
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anybody here vote to join the WTO? Anybody here paying
dues to the WTO,'' James Hoffa, president of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, asked the crowd at Tuesday's union rally.
``Then why don't we get the hell out of the WTO?''
</P>
<P>
   Rousing the crowd shortly before it held a peaceful, two-hour
march through Seattle, Hoffa drew enthusiastic cheers from
organized labor groups and others assembled on a sunny afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the ones that make the work, we are the ones that make
the profits,'' Hoffa thundered, ``and we are the ones that are
going to have a place at the table of the WTO, or we're going to
shut it down.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of high rhetoric. Air Line Pilots Association
president Duane Woerth even paraphrased Patrick Henry at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know not what course others may take,'' said Woerth, ``But
the Air Line Pilots Association isn't going to the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   Woerth said the WTO negotiators want to bring the civil aviation
industry _ worth, he said, $1 trillion a year worldwide _ under its
regulatory umbrella. That, said Woerth, would threaten unions like
the one he represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``People all over the world are getting hurt by the WTO and
their tactics,'' said Jay Boyle, 44, a telephone installer for US
West in nearby Vancouver, Wash., and a member of the Communications
Workers of America labor union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think workers in the United States understand labor
anger,'' Boyle said. ``Social unrest is something we haven't seen
since the 60s, and maybe it's time to get back to something like
that.''

HUNT GROWS FOR DRUG WAR GRAVES IN BORDER CITY 

</HEADLINE>

and ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico _ After spending two days searching the
ranchlands south of this border city for the buried remains of as
many as 100 people abducted and killed by a ferocious drug cartel,
U.S and Mexican authorities found only the bones of one person and
so they broadened the scope of their hunt Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seemingly tedious pace of the investigation,
authorities from both countries remain confident they will find
more bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very concrete information as to these sites,'' said
Jose Larrieta Carrasco, head of the organized crime unit for the
Mexican Attorney General's Office, known by its Spanish initials
PGR.
</P>
<P>
   PGR officers, members of the Mexican military, 65 FBI agents and
personnel from the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Customs Service
began searching the grounds of two ranches near Ciudad Juarez on
Monday. Led to the sites by a paid informant, the Mexican and U.S.
officers used electronic equipment to scan beneath the surface of
the ground for possible grave sites. A back hoe was used to move
earth.
</P>
<P>
   The officers Monday searched only the two ranches _ one 18 miles
south of Juarez, the other 40. But with few results, they expanded
their efforts Tuesday afternoon. Officials offered few details of
their hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Based on missing person reports filed in recent years, agents
believe there could be as many as 100 people buried in the region,
including 22 Americans. Some non-government sources say the number
could be as high as 196.
</P>
<P>
   All of the victims were either tied to or got caught up in the
vicious battle waged by drug cartels in the Juarez region fighting
for control of cocaine and marijuana markets, authorities believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe these people were killed for their knowledge or for
being witness to drug trafficking,'' Assistant FBI Director Thomas
Pickard said in Washington. ``Most of the information we have shows
these individuals were buried there at least two to three years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Juarez, just south of El Paso, Texas, is in a period of
tremendous growth as Mexicans migrate to find work. But the
population boom brought its share of problems. Mysterious
disappearances are common.
</P>
<P>
   One abduction story was shared Tuesday by Santos Alonso Aguilar
as he stood outside a white-walled ranch where authorities dug.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar said two men came to his home in Juarez on May 23, 1998,
and took away his 33-year-old brother Jose, an auto body repairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the look of those who are dressed like this,''
Aguilar said, pointing toward Mexican police guarding the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than two years we have heard nothing of him,'' said
another brother, Roman. ``They should give us an answer now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Santos Alonso Aguilar added: ``I hope my brother isn't
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Families of the missing have long complained that both Mexican
and American authorities have been unresponsive to their cries for
help. It led to Americans Jaime F. Hervella of El Paso and Saul
Sanchez of Laredo founding the Association of Relatives of
Disappeared Persons to give families a louder voice.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez _ whose son, Saul Sanchez Jr., disappeared from Juarez
in 1994 _ was surprised to learn of the hunt for grave sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been after the FBI and the State Department for five
and a half years and they wouldn't give me the time of day,'' he
said. ``Why have they waited so long? It's very disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   The association has tallied the names of 196 people missing from
the region since 1990. Not all association members believe the
abductions were tied to Juarez drug cartel.
</P>
<P>
   At its height, the Juarez cartel was so powerful it had the
chief of Mexico's anti-narcotics forces, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez
Rebollo and many low-ranking officers on its payroll, Mexican
prosecutors say. Gutierrez Rebollo was arrested in 1997, and
sentenced to 40 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 death of cartel leader Amado Carillo Fuentes, after
plastic surgery designed to help him elude law enforcement, set off
a bloody fight for control of the cartel's drug routes into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cartel leadership was assumed by Juan Jose Esparragoso Moreno,
Alcides Ramon Magana and Gilberton Salinas Doria, police say.
Salinas is a former police officer in Donna and Weslaco in the Rio
Grande Valley. The three lieutenants reportedly shifted their
operations from Juarez to Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas was arrested and his testimony helped push a
U.S.-Mexican drug investigation dubbed ``Operation Impunity.'' It
resulted in the arrest of many of the cartel's alleged ringleaders.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Tuesday called the reports of a mass grave
near Juarez another ``horrible example ... of the excesses of the
drug dealing cartels in Mexico.'' The president said the suspected
burial ground reinforces ``the imperative of not only trying to
protect our border but to work with Mexican authorities to try to
combat'' drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of success a few years ago in taking down a
number of the Colombian drug cartels and one of the adverse
consequences of that was a lot of the operations were moved north
into Mexico,'' Clinton said.

AGENT DROPS NEW BELTRE BOMBSHELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Adrian Beltre chronicles took another strange
turn as agent Scott Boras said the Dodgers altered the third
baseman's documentation when he was signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Upon examining the club's personal file on Beltre, Boras said he
found two birth certificates: one with a birth year of 1979, and
one with ``1978'' typed over a whited-out area for the year of
birth.
</P>
<P>
   Boras forwarded the documents to the commissioner's office after
the general manager's meetings in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that file there's evidence he gave them his true birth
certificate with his true age,'' Boras said. ``The only way the
Dodgers could get the birth certificate was from Beltre. There is a
copy of the birth certificate with white-out over 1979, and typed
over it is 1978. Obviously, a Dodger official did the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras claims the past Dodgers regime broke baseball rules by
signing Beltre before his 16th birthday. He is asking the
commissioner's office to grant Beltre free agency, paving the way
for the 20-year-old to sign a contract that could be as rich as
seven years, $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   In past instances in which teams signed underage players, the
commissioner's office stated that the responsibility of knowing a
player's age doesn't fall on the player or the family, but rather
on the club.
</P>
<P>
   However, Major League Baseball, which was notified of the
situation in late October, is moving slowly. Three representatives
from the commissioner's office are supposed to fly to the Dominican
Republic today and interview Beltre's family Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It's uncommon for baseball to conduct such interviews,
especially when there is ample documentation.
</P>
<P>
   All Dodgers officials are referring questions to Dodgers general
counsel Sam Fernandez, who said he couldn't comment on anything
regarding the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't comment on the investigation,'' Fernandez said,
``other than to say we've cooperating with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations
for the Office of the Commissioner, did not return numerous phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre's file also included more than a half-dozen official
government documents, including work visas, that support the notion
the Dodgers knew Beltre was underage when he was signed July 7,
1994, Boras said.
</P>
<P>
   If Beltre isn't declared a free agent, a grievance is expected
to be filed with the players union.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre's birth date is listed as April 7, 1978 in Dodger
publications, but Boras said Beltre's birth date is actually April
7, 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Though the prevailing thought throughout baseball is the Dodgers
will lose Beltre, the length of time it's taken to review the case
has frustrated both sides. The Dodgers don't know if they need to
find a major-league third baseman to replace Beltre, and Beltre is
left in limbo. Both sides are hoping for a ruling before the winter
meetings begin next Friday in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   As the Dodgers try to restructure their club into a contender
next season, the last thing they needed was to worry about Beltre.
He's considered one of the most talented young players in the game,
and hit .275 with 15 homers, 67 RBI and 18 stolen bases in his
first full season last year. He also made 29 errors, but many were
due to inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers remain on the outskirts of the Todd Zeile derby. If
they lose Beltre, Zeile, a Van Nuys native, could become a highly
sought free-agent prospect.

NYC WILL TAKE MORE TIME TO IMPOSE NEW SHELTER RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City officials said Tuesday that new rules to make
work and other welfare requirements a condition of shelter for
homeless families would not go into effect Wednesday, despite an
earlier announcement by the city's homeless agency.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they were still working out procedures for
ejecting parents and seeking foster care for some homeless
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are protocols being finalized, and that is very much
under discussion now,'' said Nicholas Scoppetta, the commissioner
of the Administration for Children's Services, on Tuesday. ``We're
very close.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Coles, a senior adviser to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
declined to specify a new starting date. Though the Department of
Homeless Services told shelter operators in October that the new
program would begin Wednesday, Coles denied that any postponement
was involved. The Giuliani administration has said that the rules
will be in place by late December, and Coles said the actual
starting date would be sooner _ ``within the next two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Assistant Corporation Counsel Leonard Koerner said that he
had been about to fax a letter setting a new date of Dec. 13 to
Steven Banks, a Legal Aid Society lawyer for the homeless, and to
attach plans for putting the rules into effect. ``But that letter
was withheld'' until Wednesday or Thursday for revisions, he said.
In any case, Koerner added, the rules will not be enforced until
after Banks is officially notified.
</P>
<P>
   The Dec. 1 date became doubtful after many shelter operators
declined to attend a Nov. 29 meeting scheduled to explain the
rules. New training sessions have been scheduled for Dec. 6, 8 and
11, said Fred Shack, president of the Tier II Coalition, which
represents the nonprofit agencies that run all homeless family
shelters under city contract.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say that requiring work in exchange for shelter
will help move homeless people into gainful employment and
independence, and keep them from using shelters to escape personal
responsibility if they fail to follow public assistance rules.
</P>
<P>
   But coalition members are on record opposing the regulations and
are being canvassed now to see if they are prepared to refuse to
enforce them, Shack said. Shelter operators are alarmed by the
experiences of families ejected from shelters in Suffolk County
under the same regulations, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that people would want families living in
cars, living in basements, moving children every day or two,'' he
said. ``That's just not in the best interest of our families. It
doesn't motivate people to work.''
</P>
<P>
   A coalition survey of shelters has determined that about 10
percent of the 5,000 families in them have public assistance cases
that are closed or are under welfare sanctions that would make them
subject to expulsion. ``That's 500 families,'' Shack said. ``It's
very frightening.''

BRYANT COULD RETURN WEDNESDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Lakers got an unexpected boost Tuesday from the
their medical team. Kobe Bryant was cleared to play and is likely
to be activated in time for tonight's home game against the Golden
State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who broke a bone in his right hand Oct. 13, had hoped to
return a week ago. Then he was told he might be out until Dec. 8.
He split the difference, as team orthopedist Dr. Stephen Lombardo
and hand specialist Dr. Robert Zemel gave him the clean bill of
health Tuesday morning in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Tests showed Bryant completely healed, though he has been fitted
with a protective pad that he'll wear in games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him on the phone this afternoon, he's excited
about playing,'' coach Phil Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on when is up to Jackson. But the coach doesn't
plan to wait long and said Bryant could start as soon as Friday
night, when the Lakers play host to the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor came to him and said, `It looks like you're OK, the
results were good.' Kobe said, `Does that mean I can play?' He
said, `Yes.' (Bryant) said, `I'm playing tomorrow night. . . .' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers will have to make a roster move _ rookie John
Celestand could go back to the injured list _ and Jackson has to
mull whether Bryant should practice a couple days before being
activated, but noted, ``It's almost impossible to keep him off the
roster and not let him play (Wednesday) night.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Bryant has been wearing the protective pad for
several days, and ``I think he can shoot with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, who along with Glen Rice has been carrying the
team in Bryant's absence, said he was ``glad to have him back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're going to have all our weapons at full strength,'' he
said. ``Kobe misses games, I held the fort down for those games,
now we should be on our way. We should be a dangerous team.''
</P>
<P>
   And O'Neal said reintegrating Bryant into the triangle offense
won't pose a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not going to be a test, because there's rules (to the
offense),'' he said. ``First guy to the post gets to take the post,
everybody else has to take the backside. Those are the rules. We
ain't going to be fighting over that.''

ANALYSIS: WHAT TO DO ABOUT MEDICAL ERRORS COULD BECOME CAMPAIGN
ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been known for some time that medical errors are a major
cause of death and suffering in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Institute of Medicine, the medical arm of the National
Academy of Sciences, has called for a new federal office to protect
patients and said Congress should require all health care providers
to report mistakes that cause serious injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   The main question is how the proposed system might work. While
many health-related organizations and consumer groups welcomed the
proposal, others expressed concern about additional government
involvement in personal health care. Still others, including
President Clinton, were concerned about patient confidentiality.
Health maintenance organizations say they wonder how frank
discussion of errors can occur as long as health care providers
fear malpractice suits. And some state governments pointed out that
they already had systems designed to do just the kind of thing the
academy was suggesting.
</P>
<P>
   One way or another, though, the medical error is likely to be an
issue in the presidential campaign. Both Vice President Al Gore and
former Sen. Bill Bradley have talked about using advanced
technology to improve the quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued on Monday, the academy said there was a clear
need to impose ``rigorous changes'' throughout the fragmented
health care system to reduce the estimated 44,000 to 98,000 deaths
from medical errors each year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of medical errors do not result from individual
recklessness, but from basic flaws in the way the health care
system is organized,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-member committee that wrote the report said that in
alerting the public to the problem it had been inspired by several
well-publicized cases.
</P>
<P>
   One was that of Betsy Lehman, a 39-year-old health columnist for
The Boston Globe who died in 1994 after an overdose of chemotherapy
for breast cancer at the Dana Farber Cancer Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Another case was that of Willie King, who had part of the wrong
leg amputated at University Community Hospital in Tampa, Fla., in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1995, the chief neurosurgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York operated on the wrong side of a patient's
brain.
</P>
<P>
   But the public is less aware of the thousands of other medical
errors that occur each year in hospitals, clinics and doctor's
offices, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
   Adverse medical events occurred in 3.7 percent of patients in a
large study in New York state, and in 2.9 percent of patients in a
study in Colorado and Utah. And deaths among those who experienced
adverse events in the studies ranged from 8.8 percent in Colorado
and Utah to 13.6 percent in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said that deaths resulted from hospitals' stocking
full-strength drugs despite the fact that they posed a great danger
unless they were diluted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The know-how exists to prevent many of these mistakes,'' the
report said. But it also said that ``unsafe care is one of the
prices we pay for not having organized systems of care with clear
lines of accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong support for the findings came from the National Patient
Safety Foundation, a group started by the American Medical
Association but which is now independent.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA supported the proposal, a surprise turn of events for a
group that has long criticized newspaper articles that called
attention to incompetent doctors and medical errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't my grandmother's AMA. A lot of the AMA is different
than in the 1970s,'' said Dr. Nancy Dickey, a former president of
the association. ``We're talking daily about health insurance for
every individual and openly about impaired doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy said a crucial strategy in reducing errors was
shifting the focus ``from blaming individuals for past errors to a
focus on preventing future errors by designing safety in the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that ``we've got to work through how we can use
technology, and how we can maybe even slow some of the actions, to
make sure that mistakes like this aren't made.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also concerned about protecting patient privacy, said
Chris Jennings, &UR;  &LR; deputy assistant to the president for health
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, which represents HMOs, said: ``The National Academy of
Sciences should be commended for shining light on an important
problem. Health plans will rise to this challenge and will work
with doctors, hospitals and public officials to address these
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ``If we want to move in this direction to secure
improvements, as the public wants, there have to be some changes in
liability and malpractice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ignagni said the recommendations by the academy's expert
panel were consistent with the goals and strengths of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   In defining error as the failure to complete a planned action as
intended or the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim, the academy
said errors could happen at any stage of care, from diagnosis to
treatment to preventive care. Not all errors result in harm, the
committee said.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce errors, the academy called for creation of a center in
the Department of Health and Human Services to develop tools and
systems to address persistent problems.
</P>
<P>
   The new federal center would also set national safety goals,
track progress in meeting them and be an objective source of the
latest information on patient safety. Units in the center could
focus on particular types of errors, like those related to drugs
and those in particular settings, like intensive care units.
</P>
<P>
   Information would come from a mandatory reporting system similar
to one in New York, where the state specifies which adverse
outcomes hospitals must report and which they may exclude. Health
officials have visited various hospitals statewide to help identify
the cause of certain bad occurrences and help them to establish
strategies to avoid them in the future, said Kristine Smith, a
spokeswoman for the department.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of states have mandatory reporting requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report cited New York's program as a model, a
committee member, Dr. Mark Chassin, a former New York state health
commissioner who works at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York,
disagreed. Chassin said the program ``is the weakest link'' in the
proposal. Specific programs like one to measure outcomes from heart
bypass operations would be more valuable, he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The report said, ``It may be part of human nature to err, but it
is also part of human nature to create solutions, find better
alternatives and meet the challenges ahead.''

ELIZABETH VINING, 97, TUTOR TO FUTURE EMPEROR AKIHITO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.C.)   (bl)

<P>
   Elizabeth Gray Vining, a Quaker schoolteacher who was tutor to
the shy, lonely boy who became the Emperor Akihito of Japan, died
Nov. 27 at Kendal-at-Longwood, a retirement community in Kennett
Square, Pa. She was 97.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Elizabeth Vining's stay in the rigidly enclosed
world of the Japanese imperial court has some of the romance of
Margaret Landon's novel, ``Anna and the King of Siam,'' the tale of
Anna Leonowens, who in the 1860s tutored the Crown Prince
Chulalongkorn of Siam, as Thailand was known. It was Mrs. Vining
who introduced the future ruler of Japan to the English language,
and to the ways of Western democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Vining wrote her own book about her experience, ``Windows
for the Crown Prince'' (1952), which became a best seller. She was
only one of several tutors to the prince, but she and young Akihito
became deeply fond of one another, and long after he grew to
manhood, the prince kept in touch with his former teacher. ``If
ever anything I did has been a success,'' said Emperor Hirohito,
according to The Japan Times, ``it was asking Mrs. Vining to come
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Gray Vining was born into an old Quaker family in
Philadelphia where her father, John Gray, made surveying
instruments used by Admiral Robert Peary in his exploration of the
North Pole and in the building of the Trans-Siberian railroad. She
attended the Germantown Friends school and Bryn Mawr College and
received a degree in library science from Drexel University. She
went on to teach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Vining had a tall, angular beauty, and in 1929, she married
Morgan Vining, associate director of the university's extension
division. In 1933, he was killed in a car accident. ``Morgan
Vining, my husband, swept my little boat out of the shallows into
the sunlit depths of life's stream,'' Mrs. Vining once wrote, and
``and we had almost five years together before, in a single moment,
he was gone.'' The couple had no children, and Mrs. Vining leaves
no immediate survivors.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband's death, Mrs. Vining discovered in Quakerism
``depths and reaches which became available to me only as I grew
into it,'' she wrote. She went on to write more than two dozen
books for both children and adults, under her maiden and married
names.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, after the Japanese surrender, Emperor Hirohito decided
that his heir should have an American tutor. He approached George
Stoddard, head of the educational advisory mission to Japan, and
asked for a recommendation. A woman was wanted, and a Christian
though not a ``fanatic,'' and she should not be familiar with
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   On an October day in 1946, Mrs. Vining met her 12-year-old
charge. He was shy and listless, his head shaved in the custom of
Japanese schoolboys. He lived separately from his parents and his
siblings. And he saw his parents only once a week. His closest
relationships seemed to be with fish, Mrs. Vining observed. Today,
Emperor Akihito is a noted ichthyologist. Even when he went for a
walk on the beach, he was accompanied by as many as 17 courtiers.
``Poor little boy!,'' Mrs. Vining wrote. ``I thought that he led a
very dull and restricted life, and I longed to set him free.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Vining asked the boy what he was doing after school,
he replied, she wrote, that ``It is not decided.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who decides?'' Mrs. Vining asked the prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chamberlains,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you decide?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But one day, she asked the prince again what he was going to do
after school. ``I decide,'' he replied, to her immense
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Vining taught Akihito privately for one hour a week and
then conducted one of his classes at the Peers School, which he
attended with other royal and well-to-do children. It was a damp,
cold place, she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Vining persevered. She gave the prince the nickname
``Jimmy'' and gradually drew him out. She began by teaching him
from the ``Book of Knowledge.'' She played tennis with him and
arranged for him to spend his leisure time with other children. She
taught him about Abraham Lincoln and William Penn.
</P>
<P>
   She attended poetry parties with the royal family and went duck
netting with them, slowly winning their confidence. The emperor and
empress asked her to tutor the prince's siblings. And then, Empress
Nagako herself asked to take English lessons from her. As Mrs.
Vining met with the empress, an English-speaking lady-in-waiting
hid discreetly behind a screen for etiquette's sake, she said. Mrs.
Vining held parent-teacher conferences with the emperor and
empress, played cards with them and taught the children how to play
Monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Vining intended to stay in Japan only one year but stayed
for four. In 1950, it was time to say goodbye. By then, Akihito's
English was so good that he was translating for her. His farewell
present to her was a poem, written in his best calligraphy, about
the birds returning to the Akasaka Palace gardens after the war.
``I had been asked to open windows onto a wider world for the Crown
Prince,'' Mrs. Vining wrote. ``but who can say to what extent I had
succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after she returned to the United States, the crown prince's
court chamberlain, Shiro Sumikura, came to see Mrs. Vining with
messages from the royal family. He had translated them and written
them down. ``1. Her Majesty feels lonesome that she has no longer
your lessons of English which she has been very much enjoying,''
Sumikura wrote. ``2. She gets your picture on her desk and thinks
as if she were seeing you every day. 3. She is now reading your
book `William Penn' with much interest. 4. Last year she
recollected that you taught a Christmas carol to her and her
daughters and they sang it after the dinner at the Kaintei on
December 20. At that time you said that you would teach it again
the next year but, to her sorry, you have gone `the next year.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Vining was to retain a nearly life-long relationship
with the royal family. Akihito stayed at her house in Philadelphia
when he came to the United States. And in 1959, Mrs. Vining was the
only foreign guest at his wedding to Michiko. In 1987, just before
the crown prince became emperor, he visited Mrs. Vining during a
trip to the United States. In 1994, she was invited to a dinner
reception for Akihito at the White House with President Clinton,
but she said she could not attend because of her advanced years.
Still, the emperor phoned her. ``She sounds like she was doing very
well,'' the Emperor said to an aide as he hung up the phone.

ON EVE OF WTO VISIT, CLINTON ENDORSES MAJOR LABOR GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Hours before he was to arrive in a Seattle engulfed by
angry protesters, President Clinton endorsed a major goal of labor
unionists who have fueled many of the demonstrations against the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In an exclusive interview Tuesday evening with the
Post-Intelligencer, Clinton for the first time embraced the concept
of eventually imposing sanctions against countries that violate
international labor standards, and said Americans shouldn't buy
products from companies that exploit workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we ought to do first of all is to adopt the Unite
States's position on having a working group on labor within the
WTO, and then that working group should develop these core labor
standards, and then they ought to be a part of every trade
agreement, and ultimately I would favor a system in which sanctions
would come for violating any provision of a trade agreement,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he deplored the conduct of violent protesters
in Seattle, but said he believes the majority of the demonstrators
are making a valuable contribution to the WTO meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The president's support of labor-related sanctions goes beyond
positions previously articulated by top officials of his
administration. Such sanctions are opposed by the European Union
and in the United States by the National Association of
Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is legitimate to say that if people are out there working
and selling their products in an international arena and Americans
are going to buy them ... we ought not to buy from countries who
violate the child labor norms, we ought not to buy from companies
that basically oppress their workers with labor conditions and lack
of a living income,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. labor leaders, told of Clinton's comments, welcomed his
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never had this kind of reaction from any government
agency before, especially the White House,'' said Thomas
Buffenbarger, the president of the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers. ``It's movement forward.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ron Judd, executive secretary of the King County Labor
Council, said ``What he has basically laid out there is all the
steps necessary to accomplish what we need to have happen. That's
much more complete than he has articulated before.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his comments in a phone interview from San
Francisco, where he attended a fund raiser for congressional
candidates. He then moved on to Los Angeles, and was scheduled to
arrive in Seattle early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to deliver a speech Wednesday at the Port of Seattle
about the importance of agricultural trade, and speak to a luncheon
of world trade ministers. Thursday the president is to sign an
Internationl Labor Organization convention before leaving for
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The interview was conducted as Washington Gov. Gary Locke and
Seattle Mayor Paul Schell were announcing that they had called out
the National Guard and imposed a curfew to try to control sometimes
violent protests that provoked police to fire tear gas and rubber
pellets.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small number of people have done non-peaceful things and
have tried to block access and prevent meetings'' Clinton said.
``That's wrong. It's not only illegal, it's just wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton took pains to emphasize his sympathy and support for
the causes espoused by many of the WTO's critics. He called the
presence of protesters in Seattle ``healthy,'' and he has agreed to
hold private meetings with critics this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret very much that a few people have given the protesters
a bad name, because I think the fact that the protesters are there,
were it not for those stopping meetings, stopping movements and not
being peaceful, would be a positive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attributed the massive protests to three concerns _ that
the WTO is unaccountable, that its rulings are not always honored,
and whether trade rules benefit the environment, workers and poor
countries.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected any suggestion that the talks should be cancelled
because of unrest in Seattle, and said that he would consider the
week a success if negotiators agree to launch a new round of talks
aimed at liberalizing global trade.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also said the WTO must open itself to critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't want people like the protesters outside of every
trade meeting until the end of time, they're going to have to open
the process so that the voices of labor, the environment and the
developing countries can be heard, and so that the decisions are
transparent, the records are open, and the consequences are
clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While in Seattle, Clinton is expected to emphasize the message
that Americans benefit from that trade, and he made that point
again during the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``On balance, the world is much better off because we've
expanded trade over the last 50 years,'' he said. ``I bet you a lot
of the protesters came to the protests wearing shoes that were made
in other countries and using cell phones and maybe a lot of them
drove cars that were foreign-manufactured. We live in a global
economy that on balance has been quite good for the United States,
but also good for developing countries, but we've got to make a
better case down deeper into society.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton endorsed not only the cause of worker rights, but also
environmental values, which he said can be honored within the
context of global trade rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer ... is to make sure that these environmental
standards are properly integrated into the WTO deliberation and
that we agree that countries ought to have more leeway on higher
environmental standards than in other areas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the positions of the United States in support
of labor and environmental rights are viewed as protectionist by
developing countries. He rejected that argument.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said Americans do cede some sovereignty when they
join international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We yield the right to be unilateral and not bound by a system
of rules anytime we join any kind of organization,'' he said. ``You
join any kind of organization in which there are going to be
disputes you can't say that `I'll only follow the rules when we
win.' And you can't say that any organization made up of human
beings will be error free.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the United States is willing to concede during the
next round of trade talks, Clinton said he is willing to open U.S.
markets ``to countries that follow responsible policies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton was adamant that he is unwilling to talk about the
United States' anti-dumping rules, which penalize countries that
sell products below cost to U.S. consumers. For example, the
Washington state apple industry has persuaded the Clinton
administration to impose tariffs on Chinese apple juice concentrate
exporters, who have driven some domestic apple growers out of
business by selling concentrate at prices the United States says
are below cost.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. anti-dumping rules are defended as simple fairness by U.S.
officials, and are much valued by the American labor movement. But
the rules are hated by countries such as Japan, which have been
penalized for alleged dumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Europeans to tell us we should stop (enforcing)
dumping (laws) when during the Asian crisis we bought literally 10
times as much foreign steel as they did is a little ludicrous when
they have absolute quotas on the number of foreign cars they will
buy that we don't have,'' he said. ``We can't give up our dumping
laws as long as we have the most open markets in the world and we
keep them open to help these countries keep going and other
countries don't do the same.''

ANNAN URGES U.S. TO REJECT ISOLATIONISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Chanting demonstrators who took over city streets
Tuesday are people who ``feel vulnerable'' and ``feel lost'' in a
fast-changing world where economic issues are global but politics
remain local, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a message here for all of us,'' Annan told the
Seattle Rotary Club, some of whose members had to brave tear gas to
reach the Washington Athletic Club to hear him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reach out and explain the link between the local,
the national and the international,'' said Annan, a diplomat from
Ghana who has witnessed his share of turmoil heading such sensitive
U.N. operations as refugee assistance.
</P>
<P>
   As Annan began his speech, the sound of exploding tear gas
canisters could be heard outside on 6th Avenue, along with the
voices of the protestors.
</P>
<P>
   Annan was urbane, funny and gracious toward a city that Tuesday
gave international visitors such a raucous and sometimes violent
welcome. Annan thanked those who ``braved it'' to hear him _ a
gathering that grew to over 300 _ and added: ``This is a great
city, a high-technology city, and a city with a history of dealings
with the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. leader said that isolationism, in both foreign and
economic affairs, was the policy of the United States for many
years. ``We need to hear that you reject isolationism,'' he said.
``Isolationism has run its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some suggest that the United States, as the one superpower,
need not cooperate with others or do so on its own terms,'' Annan
added. ``Most of the world's problems are so complex, however, that
they cannot be solved by any power, no matter how peaceful, acting
on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that Congress' recent grudging agreement to pay
much of the United States' overdue U.N. dues ``is a turning point
in efforts to restore the U.S. to its rightful leadership role'' in
the world body. He criticized some of the conditions imposed on
U.N. agency funding.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Tuesday signed a waiver that would allow
$15 million in U.S. funds to go toward international family
planning organizations that promote abortion rights. The budget
compromise tied paying off about $1 billion in U.N. dues to banning
U.S. funds for those international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Annan exchanged compliments with Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. ``I
am glad we are paying our dues,'' said Murray, who was supposed to
introduce Annan to the group but was held up by the protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for your vote,'' Annan replied with a broad smile.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle businessman Skip Kotkins asked Annan why the WTO has
become such a lightning rod for protest. He apologized for not
wearing a tie, explaining that well-dressed pedestrians had been
singled out for abuse by more militant demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look more relaxed and at ease,'' Annan replied with a
broad smile. The Secretary-General jokingly chided another
questioner, Seattle attorney William H. Gates, Sr., for not being a
member of Rotary.
</P>
<P>
   Annan has brought an intellectual aggressiveness to his U.N.
office, which suffered from weak leadership in the two decades
before his election. It was reflected in his statements Tuesday
night. Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   __ Cuba: Annan said that the U.S. policy to isolate Cuba
economically has failed and should be abandoned. ``Sometimes these
sanctions entrench leaders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Debt forgiveness: Answering a question from former Washington
Gov. Mike Lowry, Annan agreed that wealthy nations need to relieve
poor Third World countries of their debt load. He said, too, that
investment and development assistance must continue if conditions
of poverty are to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   __ Dictators: Annan strongly endorsed putting those responsible
for ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Rwanda on trial before
international tribunals. ``I hope international courts send out the
message that those who commit these crimes will be prosecuted,'' he
said. ``With what has happened to (former Gen. Augusto) Pinochet in
British and Spanish courts, leaders are beginning to think twice
(about) what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Chile's former dictator has been held in Britain pending a
decision on whether he will be extradited to Spain to be tried for
the deaths of Spanish citizens during his regime.
</P>
<P>
   With Annan gracefully fielding complex questions, it was
possible to see the sophisticated face that Seattle hoped to show
the world in hosting the WTO meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Murray made the point afterward. ``It is right that Seattle is
hosting the World Trade Organization and reaching for the future by
talking to people rather than shouting them down,'' she said.

AMID FRIENDLY GREETING, A CANDIDATE'S GRILLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JAMES DAO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEENE, N.H. _ This is a state that takes its responsibility for
holding the nation's first presidential primary very seriously.
Voters expect to meet candidates, shake their hands and ask them a
barbed question or two. Plenty of folks here would probably take a
candidate home for a good health care debate over coffee if they
could.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, then, it was that sense of duty that inspired Aine
Whittum to subject former Sen. Bill Bradley to an aggressive
grilling Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who is running for the Democratic presidential
nomination, was greeting voters along the snow-covered main drag of
this western New Hampshire town when he decided to pop into Ms.
Whittum's place of employment: the Vitality Shop, a purveyor of
herbal and homeopathic medicines, organic foods and sundry other
New Age products.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had just begun bantering with the store's owner when Ms.
Whittum, 24, sweetly piped up: ``Can I ask a question?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' said Bradley, sounding affably unprepared for the
interrogation he was about to get.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whittum pulled out one of the Bradley campaign's policy
papers and, holding it aloft like a summons, said, ``I was
wondering about your economic policy. I don't feel you are being
very clear.'' She continued: ``Part of your agenda is to keep the
economy growing and growing. But the earth is only one size and
everything can't keep growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Possibly sensing the danger of having to face down a hostile
questioner while surrounded by half a dozen reporters, Bradley
quickly tried to address her concerns. In the new global economy,
he said, American economic growth would be fed by software and
service companies, nonpolluting industries that don't use a lot of
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Whittum said she wasn't talking just about natural
resources, but about unchecked population growth, global economic
instability and a range of other potential catastrophes. It was
time, she suggested, for a return to the barter system.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had patiently launched into an analysis of the failures
of the barter system in Russia when his aides began nudging him
toward the door. He bid adieu.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whittum, despite having monopolized the candidate for more
time than many reporters get in a week, was not satisfied. Who
would she vote for? ``I'm thinking of writing myself in,'' she
answered.
</P>
<P>
   If Bradley has that hungry look about him, it's probably because
he is. Hungry, that is.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to keep weight off during the campaign _ a nearly
impossible task given the pressures to load up on fatty fast foods
_ Bradley usually dines on salads and fruits. But it just doesn't
seem to be quite enough for his 6-foot-5 frame.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that Bradley can often be spied grabbing food at odd
moments while he campaigns. For instance, on Monday night after a
televised town hall meeting in Manchester, he ducked into a room
where reporters had been watching the event. But Bradley was not
looking to offer last-minute dollops of spin to stray journalists.
No, he was in search of pizza. He triumphantly emerged from the
room munching a cold slice, unperturbed by the congealing glob of
cheese that was hanging off it like a lead sinker.
</P>
<P>
   It is also probably his growling stomach more than his desire to
win votes that drives Bradley to steal stray french fries and onion
rings from the plates of diners when he visits restaurants on
campaign events.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley may have recently shifted eating tactics. Monday's
dinner: steak.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about Bradley and clothes?
</P>
<P>
   He is known for wearing the same suit for weeks at a time,
repairing torn ties with Scotch tape and resoling shoes scores of
times to avoid buying new ones. But Bradley is not just unchic: he
has made a political art form of being unartfully dressed.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter once jokingly asked him where he had bought his
tie, Bradley proudly volunteered that he had forgotten to pack one
and had to steal the tie from an aide. And when, at his wife's
urging, he bought shoes for the first time in _ he claims _ 25
years, he made a campaign event out of it, leading a pack of camera
crews into a shoe store in Nashua, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   So it should not have been surprising, perhaps, that Washington
was aflutter with rumors about Bradley's attire this week. Was that
an earth-tone suit he was wearing during a speech at Tufts
University? And since when does the dowdy Bradley wear French-blue
shirts? Was this an attempt to mimic the clothing strategies of his
Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   Well, in fact the suit was not earth-toned, but stolid,
conservative banker's gray. (It just looked kind of earthy from a
distance.) And about that deep blue shirt, well, Bradley had an
answer for that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Seems that, once again, he had forgotten to pack enough shirts
during a recent visit to Iowa. So he had a trusty aide buy him some
new ones. He asked for blue, but he didn't specify trendy French
blue. But that was what he got and that was all he had to wear in
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was some trend here, Bradley, as he often does
when confronted with a question he considers silly, sighed and ever
so slightly rolled his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not trend,'' he said. ``This is a moment that
illustrates the deeper character of the candidate.''

PHILLIPS OUSTED AS UMPIRES VOTE TO FORM NEW UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With an overwhelming 62 percent majority, insurgent
major league umpires effectively tossed Richie Phillips out of his
job Tuesday, ending his 21-year reign as the chief labor negotiator
and lawyer for the umpires' union. Only a successful appeal of the
election, overseen by the National Labor Relation Board, could save
Phillips' job.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires voted 57-35 to decertify the Major League Umpires
Association and replace it with the Major League Umpires
Independent Organizing Committee as their collective-bargaining
representative. Phillips has represented the umpires for as long as
they have had a union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is a statement by all major league umpires that it's
time for change,'' John Hirschbeck, one of the dissident leaders,
said. ``We want a union that's run by umpires and advised by
attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he would have said to Phillips if he had been at
the NLRB's New York office for the ballot counting, Hirschbeck
said: ``It's time for us to move on. Thank you for what you've done
for us in our careers. Now it's time for major league umpires to
move in a new direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry Crawford, the union president and a staunch supporter
of Phillips, indicated the fight was not over. ``I have a few
options left and I'm going to explore those options,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, a veteran National League umpire, acknowledged that an
appeal of the outcome was one of the options. ``I would say it's
probably likely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford declined to say what the grounds for an appeal might
be. But Joel Smith, a Baltimore labor lawyer working with the
Hirschbeck group, said: ``I know of no solid grounds for appeal.
This has been an effort by umpires for umpires and the vote is
quite emphatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck and Joe Brinkman, another leader of the organizing
committee, had expected to receive at least 48 votes and as many as
57 votes.
</P>
<P>
   In figuring on 48, they had counted on votes from at least seven
or eight of the 22 umpires who lost their jobs last summer as a
result of Phillips' failed resignation strategy. More than eight of
the 22 may have added their votes to the dissident group in the
secret ballot, people on their side of the issue said.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires, who obviously remain deeply split as they approach
negotiations for a new labor agreement with Major League Baseball,
began their fight after more than 50 umpires signed letters of
resignation last July, although some quickly rescinded. After
Phillips submitted the letters to the National and American League
offices, the league presidents hired 25 new umpires and accepted 22
resignations. Their action is the subject of an arbitration hearing
that is scheduled to begin Dec. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Shapiro, a Baltimore lawyer and player agent, who has been
advising the dissident umpires organizing committee, said the
existing union would continue to handle the arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the Major League Umpires Association is charged with
that arbitration and we won't interfere,'' he said. ``But we'll do
everything we can from a legal standpoint to support it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck said getting the 22 umpires back to work would be
among the new group's top priorities when it begins negotiating a
new labor agreement with baseball officials. The current contract
expires Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The 22 terminated umpires were permitted to vote, as were the
new umpires the leagues hired. All 93 eligible voters mailed in
ballots, but one was voided because the umpire signed his name on
it. Names of voters are not permitted in elections conducted by the
NLRB.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Stephen Appell, an NLRB lawyer, began counting the
ballots in the board's offices at Federal Plaza in Manhattan, it
was clear that the dissidents would win. The existing union led
only once in the 14-minute count, by 3-2. The organizing committee
received 10 of the next 12 votes, and the rout was on. When Appell
read out the 47th vote for the committee at 5:24 p.m., Phillips was
_ barring a successful appeal _ baseball labor history.
</P>
<P>
   The union has seven days in which to file an appeal.  &QL;

BLACKLIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 JOHN BERRY, 82, DIRECTOR WHO WENT INTO EXILE DURING '50s (bl)  
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Berry, a stage and movie director, writer and actor who
made more than 50 films and, entangled in the blacklist, exiled
himself from Hollywood during the anti-communist inquests of the
1950s, died Nov. 29 at his home in Paris. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Long drawn to the dramatic conflicts of South Africa, Berry had
just finished editing his latest film, ``Boesman and Lena,'' based
on a 1969 play by Athol Fugard, said Kent Jones, a curator with the
Film Society of Lincoln Center. Berry had directed an acclaimed
production of the play at Circle in the Square in 1970. The film
about an outcast couple _ so-called Cape coloreds, classified
neither white nor black and forced to wander a dismal landscape _
stars Danny Glover and Angela Bassett and is set for release in
May.
</P>
<P>
   In a career spanning more than 60 years, Berry, a rugged-faced
pipe smoker, worked alongside many of the era's leading lights,
from Orson Welles to Paul Muni, Richard Wright, Joan Fontaine, John
Garfield, Shelley Winters, Fernandel, Jean-Paul Sartre, John
Houseman, Lillian Gish, Curt Jurgens and Dorothy Dandridge.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared in Welles' Mercury Theater production of ``Julius
Caesar''; played a defense lawyer in a 1942 Broadway production of
Wright's ``Native Son''; directed Garfield and Winters in the 1951
thriller ``He Ran All the Way,'' about a fugitive murderer who
terrorizes a family, and wrote the screenplay for ``Tamango,'' a
1957 film that paired Jurgens and Dandridge as interracial lovers,
a provocative premise at the time.
</P>
<P>
   His work, not surprisingly, drew both bouquets and brickbats,
but his most difficult ordeal began in 1950 after he agreed to make
a short film on the Hollywood 10, a group of leading moviemakers
who refused to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities
Committee's investigation into alleged communist infiltration of
the movie business.
</P>
<P>
   As Berry later recounted in a 1974 interview with The New York
Times, when the House panel began looking into him, there was
testimony about a supposed communist cell meeting at his house in
Hollywood; he said he knew nothing about it. By the end of the
year, ``faced with the choice of naming names or going to jail,''
he had packed up and moved, poverty stricken, to Paris, leaving his
wife, Gladys Cole, and two young children behind. They later joined
him, but the marriage fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he said: ``People frequently ask me if I'm bitter about
those days and and I must admit that I  &UR; regret &LR;  some of it. But the
horizon of my life became infinite; I met people, encountered a
culture I'd never have known otherwise, one I got to know deeply
because I had to survive in it.'' He returned to the United States
in 1964 but retained his ties to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Berry was born in 1917 in the Bronx where he made his stage
debut at 5 in a vaudeville act. His father became a wealthy
restaurateur _ at one point he owned 28 restaurants _ and one was
near the Playhouse on West 49th Street where young John would be
deposited on matinee days.
</P>
<P>
   The family lost its wealth in the Depression and Berry ended up
in the Catskills telling jokes at resort hotels for $5 a week. He
joined a Shakespeare troupe in the city and auditioned before John
Houseman for the part of Marc Antony in a Mercury Theater
production of ``Julius Caesar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a splendid fellow,'' Houseman said, ``but your speech
is dreadful.'' He prescribed elocution lessons. Berry joined the
production and won other parts, rising to become an assistant to
Welles, which turned him away from acting and toward directing.
``It was like living near the center of a volcano of creating
inspiration and fury _ glamorous and exciting, full of the kind of
theatricality that seems lost forever,'' he recalled in the Times
interview.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, he played in and helped direct Welles' production of
``Native Son'' about a black man who kills a white woman, and later
took it on the road, experiencing, as he said, ``the enormous
prejudice, the overpowering sense of white superiority that existed
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, with Houseman's help, he began his Hollywood career,
soon directing ``Miss Susie Slagle's'' (1946) with Lillian Gish,
Veronica Lake and Sonny Tufts. There followed a flurry of other
films including ``Cross My Heart'' (1946), ``Casbah,'' (1948) and
`` Tension'' (1949). He directed the John Garfield film, ``He Ran
All the Way'' _ the blacklisted actor's last movie _ before his
film on the Hollywood 10 drove Berry into exile in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived with $800 and scratched out a living ghostwriting
scripts. At one point, he recalled, he was down to his last 28
cents.
</P>
<P>
   He marked his return to the United States in 1964 with an
off-Broadway production of Fugard's ``Blood Knot'' about two
brothers, one black, the other white.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, he directed ``Boesman and Lena'' with James Earl Jones
at Circle in the Square and months later, Lorraine Hansberry's
``Blancs,'' also with Jones. Two years later Berry directed two
plays, Romulus Linney's ``Love Suicide at Schofield Barracks'' on
Broadway and Arthur Miller's ``Crucible'' at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he also kept making films. In 1974 he directed
Diahann Carroll and James Earl Jones in the comedy ``Claudine.'' In
1978 came ``The Bad News Bears Go to Japan'' (critics said they
should have stayed home) and in 1982 he teamed up again with Ms.
Carroll for a television movie shown on NBC, ``Sister, Sister,''
written by Maya Angelou, a co-producer.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's family could not be reached in Paris yesterday, but
Variety reported that he is survived by his wife, Myriam Boyer; two
sons, Dennis and Arnie, and a daughter, Jan.

SUDDENLY, UCLA MORE LIKE ICU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just when UCLA was gaining momentum and its
wounded were starting to walk . . .
</P>
<P>
   Forward Jerome Moiso accidentally headbutts forward Sean
Farnham, giving Farnham a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Matt Barnes accidentally headbutts forward Jason Kapono,
giving Kapono a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso gets the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Ray Young tumbles to the floor and strains his neck.
</P>
<P>
   All in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, No. 12 UCLA's lineup is in flux entering tonight's
matchup with winless Morgan State at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `Don't worry about who starts, you should all be
ready to play,' '' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``Between the
injuries and our conditioning level, it'll be a while before we
find a routine to the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Farnham, who started against Iona, did not practice Tuesday but
was cleared to play tonight. He's listed as probable.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono, the superb freshman, practiced Tuesday and is expected
to make his third start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso, who's averaging 17 points and 10 rebounds, is
questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who made 5 of 6 3-point shots and scored a career-high 17
points against Iona, is questionable. He also has a strained
ligament in his right (shooting) thumb that requires a protective
wrap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably go another two weeks with tape on my hand, then
let it go free,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of concussions: The Bruins treated Kapono and Farnham
better than they did forward Todd Ramasar when he was injured two
seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got a concussion, and the guys told him his name was Frank,
and he believed them,'' Lavin said, laughing. ``Since then, his
nickname's been Frank.''
</P>
<P>
   The big man's minutes: Center Dan Gadzuric played seven minutes
against Fairfield and 15 against Iona on his tender,
tendinitis-plagued knees, and his time might climb tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is 20 minutes, at the most 23, but it could be as low
as 15,'' Lavin said. ``I rely on him (to gauge discomfort), but
it's more on a feel of what I think he's capable of. I try to take
the conservative stance.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably a wise strategy considering the January
gauntlet. When the Bruins face Arizona and North Carolina in a
five-day span _ and Stanford two weeks later _ Lavin wants Gadzuric
available for 25-30 minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain matchups I'd like to keep him in as much as
possible,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Point of emphasis: After tonight, the Bruins play two games in
2{ weeks because of exams. (Gonzaga on Dec. 11, DePaul on the
18th.) That gives Lavin plenty of practice time to correct
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense is not where we need it to be,'' he said. ``Some
of it's tied to (poor) conditioning (resulting from injuries). When
you're tired, you come out of your stance and you reach more. We
have to play better help defense, better position defense.''

PAID LEAVE FOR PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, Dec. 1: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's plan to give states the option of providing
unemployment insurance benefits for new parents is good for working
families. The 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act gave workers the
right to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn
child or sick relative without losing their jobs. But many
low-income workers cannot afford to take any amount of time off
without pay. The new experimental project, which would be totally
voluntary, would allow states to subsidize a leave following the
birth or adoption of a child if they so chose. At least four states
_ Vermont, Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington _ have proposed
legislation to extend unemployment benefits to parental leave.
</P>
<P>
   Under current federal law, states have substantial flexibility
to determine eligibility for unemployment benefits and benefit
levels. Although unemployment insurance is traditionally seen as
helping only those who have been involuntarily laid off and are
immediately available to work, many states have granted benefits to
workers who are not in that narrow category. A third of the states,
for example, grant unemployment benefits to workers who leave their
jobs because of urgent family reasons, such as a spouse being
relocated. Federal regulations have likewise allowed states to
grant unemployment benefits to workers who are off the job because
of training programs, illness in some situations, jury duty or
temporary layoffs. Allowing states to experiment with providing
benefits to new parents could help meet the needs of the changing
labor force where mothers and fathers both work. The Labor
Department would evaluate the impact of the benefits on insurance
costs, and on worker retention and management, before the program
is made permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Business lobbies are concerned that a new benefit would drain
the trust funds that pay unemployment insurance. But many states
currently have significant trust fund surpluses because of low
unemployment in recent years, and many have chosen to reduce
unemployment insurance taxes as a result. State policy makers are
in the best position to determine whether their labor force would
be helped by expanded parental leave benefits. The Clinton
administration would give them the ability to move forward on this
issue.

PROBLEMS BEGAN INSTANTLY IN FATAL NEWARK PLANE CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Troubles on the small single-engine plane that crashed into a
Newark, N.J., neighborhood last Friday morning started almost
immediately after takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Only a minute and 25 seconds into the flight, the pilot, Itzhak
Jacoby, radioed air traffic controllers in Westbury, N.Y. ``I have
a problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Three times in the next minute and 35 seconds, Jacoby sent the
same short message, the last time about three minutes before his
white and red Beechcraft Bonanza glanced off the top of a factory
building a mile from downtown Newark about 10:55 a.m. It fell from
there and hurtled along Kent Street, breaking apart as it went.
</P>
<P>
   The crash killed Jacoby, 56, an experienced pilot; his wife,
Gail, 50; and their daughter, Atira, 13. It injured 25 people, 2
seriously, on a 200-yard stretch of the street, and damaged 17
apartment buildings and nine parked cars.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary transcript of three minutes of conversation
between Jacoby and the air traffic controller, released Tuesday by
the National Transportation Safety Board, offered few clues to the
small plane's problems. Only once did Jacoby provide a hint of the
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a gyro problem,'' he said, at 10:50 a.m. ``Maybe some
water got in it.''
</P>
<P>
   David Muzio, who is directing the safety board's investigation
of the crash, declined Tuesday to offer any analysis or
interpretation of the three minutes of conversation, or Jacoby's
four references to ``a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the plane's three gyroscopes _ small devices that
operate crucial cockpit instruments _ are being examined at the
safety board's laboratory in Washington. Two of the gyroscopes were
found on Kent Street on Saturday, and the third was found Sunday
imbedded in a wall of a KFC fast-food restaurant at the end of the
street. Most of the pieces of the wrecked plane came to a stop in
the restaurant's parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Muzio said Tuesday that his inquiry had turned up no signs of
engine failure or defects in the plane's frame.
</P>
<P>
   A malfunctioning gyroscope could lead to the failure of other
instruments that show the direction the plane is flying and whether
it is ascending, descending or turning, said an aviation expert,
Drew Steketee, a senior vice president of the Aircraft Owners and
Pilots Association in Frederick, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Steketee said other backup instruments in the cockpit provide
that flight information, but not as quickly or in as detailed a
form as the primary instruments served by the gyroscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Steketee cautioned that he had no information about Jacoby's
flight or of the problems he reported. But he said that a pilot
unable to see the ground or the horizon and flying solely by
cockpit instruments, as Jacoby was because of overcast skies, could
quickly lose control of his craft if the gyroscopes had
malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   The transcript suggests that Jacoby was preoccupied with the
plane's difficulties. Three times in the first two minutes of his
communications with the Westbury tower, Jacoby was told to change
his plane's direction from north to west. The Jacoby family, who
lived in Bethesda, Md., were flying from Linden Airport, eight
miles south of Newark, to Dulles International Airport outside
Washington after spending Thanksgiving in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby did not respond to the instructions to fly westerly or to
a request that he not climb above 2,000 feet. Twenty-six seconds
before his last transmission, Jacoby asked for permission to climb
higher. Steketee said the request suggested that Jacoby wanted more
time to overcome his plane's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Five seconds after Jacoby asked to fly above 2,000 feet, the
controller asked him the direction of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   His answer suggests he was not certain. ``My heading looks like
zero-three-zero,'' he answered. That meant he was headed slightly
east of north.
</P>
<P>
   The controller told him four seconds later, at 10:52 a.m., to
turn west and stay at 2,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Ten seconds later, Jacoby repeated his earlier message a fourth
time. ``I have a problem,'' he said. It was his last transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The crash displaced 50 families in 17 two- and three-family
apartment houses on Kent Street. The force of the crash blew out
windows and knocked plaster off apartment walls and ceilings. Mayor
Sharpe James said Tuesday that about 30 of the families now want to
leave Kent Street, either because they were traumatized by the
crash or because they hope to find better housing elsewhere in
Newark.

NAVY TO TRAIN OFF PUERTO RICO WITH LIVE-FIRE ISSUE UNSETTLED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An aircraft carrier and amphibious battle group
will begin training this week even though the White House has yet
to decide if the ships will be able to use a Puerto Rican island
for the final live bombing practice.
</P>
<P>
   The training schedule for the carrier Eisenhower has been held
hostage for months in a dispute between the governor of Puerto Rico
and the Pentagon over the use of a firing range on the island of
Vieques. Last month a presidential panel recommended that the range
reopen for live firing exercises, but Secretary of Defense William
Cohen has delayed making a recommendation to President Clinton
until a compromise can be reached with Pedro Rosello, the governor
of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The range was closed in April after a Puerto Rican guard was
accidentally killed in a bombing accident there. Protesters have
occupied parts of the 900-acre range that has been used for more
than 30 years for exercises the Navy considers essential for combat
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators have vowed to stay on the range to prevent any
further exercises regardless of what Clinton decides.
Administration officials say the prospect of forcibly removing the
protesters has been a concern in resolving the issue.
</P>
<P>
   By going ahead with the original training schedule but staying
away from the waters near Puerto Rico, the aircraft carrier will
begin its final preparations for deployment to the Mediterranean
Sea and the Arabian Gulf next February with routine carrier
qualification tests.
</P>
<P>
   The exercises will continue two more weeks. The Navy still
expects the carrier and battle group to train with live-fire at
Vieques during that time, a spokesman said.

   Judge Thomas P. Griesa announced his decision in open court
Tuesday, but he said that the parties' lawyers would receive the
written opinion under seal, because it contained confidential
financial information about the newspaper, which is owned by
Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Fred Drasner.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief explanation of his decision, Griesa said, ``I have
found that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the evidence about
the financial condition of The Daily News.'' The central question,
he said, was, ``Is a wage increase going to be of such magnitude
that it jeopardizes the business and jeopardizes jobs entirely?''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks indicated that he felt that The News would be in
such jeopardy. ``The financial issue is so serious that further
arbitration proceedings are necessary to deal with an issue which
could really be whether these union members have jobs or don't have
jobs,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a setback for the Newspaper and Mail
Deliverers' Union of New York, which decided nearly three years ago
that its members could get a better deal than the raise of about 3
percent that eight other craft unions at The News got for their
members. The drivers' union and The News submitted their
negotiations to binding arbitration, a proceeding that began in
April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   For The Daily News, which over the last two years has been
forced to grapple with a series of costly problems _ most notably,
its balky $62 million presses _ the judge's ruling was a
vindication. The newspaper's executives and its lawyers have been
arguing since March, when the original arbitration award was made,
that the arbitrator had failed to take into account crucial facts
about the newspaper's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon Zuckerman said, ``I think this decision was
essential to the continuation of The Daily News as a thriving,
growing newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked outside the courtroom if the union would appeal the
judge's ruling, J. Kenneth O'Connor, one of the lawyers
representing the drivers, gave a thumbs-up sign. His law partner,
J. Warren Mangan, said that the ruling was ``a surprise'' and that
he would need to discuss the situation with his clients before
there could be any decision on an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, it seemed that the truck drivers' strategy had
succeeded, when the arbitrator, J.J. Pierson, awarded the 420 or so
regular drivers an immediate increase in base salary, to $911.79 a
week, up from the current base of $773.57.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers' initial victory had also been a victory for members
of the eight other unions, based on so-called ``me too'' clauses in
their contracts, which stipulated that whatever the drivers got,
the members of other craft unions would also get.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision means that the drivers face the prospect of a
potentially time-consuming appeal and, if they lose, another
arbitration.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After spending three years in detention on the basis
of secret evidence, Nasser K. Ahmed said Tuesday that he planned to
use his freedom to revive an Islamic religious movement that
federal investigators say was a haven for terrorists who carried
out a bomb attack on the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed was released from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in
lower Manhattan on Monday night after Attorney General Janet Reno
decided against intervening to keep him in custody. The decision
went against the wishes of FBI officials who had linked Ahmed, and
the Brooklyn mosque he was affiliated with, to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI broke the Abu Bakr Mosque just as it broke David
Koresh's church,'' he said, referring to the mosque he administered
before he was jailed in April 1996. ``They brought in new leaders
and tried to take over while I was in jail. They turned the
community against each other.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials had argued that Ahmed's release would only raise
his stature among Islamic radicals, a stature they say had grew
during his years of detention. Those arguing against his release
predicted that he would plunge anew into the organizational work
that under his direction caused the Abu Bakr Mosque to become, in
the eyes of the government, a center for Islamic radicals. The
Immigration and Naturalization Service, using classified evidence,
is seeking to deport Ahmed to Egypt, his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed, 39, who speaks in soft, measured tones, says he intends
to look for work again as an electrical engineer and to be a good
father to the three children he saw only during their periodic
prison visits over the past three years. But he is also a man on a
mission, determined to rebuild the world shattered by his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Abu Bakr Mosque was unique because it was independent _ it
was beyond the control of the Egyptian government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mosque was once used as the pulpit for Sheik Omar Abdel
Rahman, who was convicted in 1995 of plotting to blow up New York
City landmarks. Ahmed praises Abdel Rahman as ``a great and
fearless scholar whose sermons made me realize that we were all
sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed had been a legal assistant to Abdel Rahman, but he has
denied being involved in terrorism. Colleagues describe him as a
central figure in the Abu Bakr Mosque's operation when Abdel Rahman
was delivering sermons there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nasser was in the mosque every day,'' said Ahmed Sattar, 40, a
board member at Abu Bakr. ``Whenever the mosque needed him, he was
there. He was the backbone of Abu Bakr Mosque. If you wanted to do
anything, you went first through him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they wanted to destroy the mosque, they had to remove
Nasser first,'' Satter added. ``He was more devoted e to the mosque
than to anything else in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed said the mosque had been a haven. ``It was the only place
Egyptians could go to find out about what was happening back
home,'' he said. ``There people could find food, a job or
assistance when no one else in the city would help. We never closed
the doors. It was open 24 hours a day so people would always have a
place to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Ahmed, the Abu Bakr Mosque withered. Its politically
active congregation, which supported the Islamic insurgency in
Egypt and raised money for Muslims who fought as volunteers in the
war in Bosnia, has dispersed. It now draws a couple of dozen
dispirited Muslims and is led by a conservative.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Reno's decision not to act to keep Ahmed in jail means
he is free for now, his troubles may not be over. He is free on
personal bond pending a final ruling by the Board of Immigration
Appeals on whether he should be granted asylum. Ahmed has said that
if he were returned to Egypt, he would be tortured by the
government. &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ahmed said that the scars of jail lie heaviest on his family.
His children, he said, were shunned by school friends who told them
their father ``was a bad man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My youngest son, Omar, began to worry me,'' said Ahmed's wife,
Salwa Elbayadi. ``We live on a first-floor apartment and the
children in the street would yell up for him to come out and play.
He would make believe he was talking to his father and then tell
them that his father had told him he could not go outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then Ahmed began sleepwalking,'' she said. ``I found him
one night by the door and had to get a lock for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed's eyes narrowed and his voice dipped to a terse whisper.
''I went to the prison psychologist to ask what we should do,'' he
said. ``I had a friend whose father was jailed in Egypt and it left
terrible memories. I am concerned, concerned about what they have
done to us.''

AUSTRALIAN MUSEUM CANCELS CONTROVERSIAL ART SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CAROL VOGEL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the furor created by the ``Sensation'' exhibition at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Australia in
Canberra has canceled the show, which was to have opened there in
June.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's director, Brian Kennedy, said the decision stemmed
from ethical questions about how the exhibition was financed in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cause for concern for us was the documentation and
discussion that occurred and the extent to which this show was
enmeshed in funding,'' he said. He cited an article in The New York
Times that revealed that Charles Saatchi, who owns the collection,
and Christie's, the auction house, provided financing for the show
and have a commercial interest in the works of its British artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a public institution can't take it,'' Kennedy said. ``We
cannot ignore what's happened in Brooklyn; we're not disconnected
from the art world. We're not separate.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Kennedy acknowledged that he had received
several hundred letters from people criticizing the museum for
agreeing to take the show. ``Sensation'' includes such disturbing
images as a dead shark floating in a tank of formaldehyde and a
bust of a man made from his own frozen blood.
</P>
<P>
   Even before ``Sensation: Young British Artists From the Saatchi
Collection'' opened in Brooklyn in October, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
called the show, which also features a painting of the Virgin Mary
with a clump of elephant dung at her breast and pornographic
cutouts in the background, ``sick stuff.'' He cut off the city's
annual contribution of $7 million to the museum, but was forced to
restore it after losing a battle in court.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that when he agreed to show ``Sensation,'' he had
no idea that Saatchi had contributed money toward the exhibition's
Brooklyn visit, nor had he any knowledge that dealers who represent
some of the artists in the show had made contributions as well. He
also said he had not known that Christie's, the auction house, was
a sponsor and had sold other works from Saatchi's vast contemporary
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that ``Sensation'' was to go to Australia
completely financed by the government, Kennedy said ``it comes too
close to the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenny L. Blyth, director of the Saatchi Gallery in London, said,
``We gather Brian Kennedy felt that it was hard to follow on after
the problems in Brooklyn _ that the integrity of the art would be
compromised and overshadowed.''
</P>
<P>
   All the art in the show belongs to Saatchi, the British
advertising magnate. When the show opened in London at the Royal
Academy of Art two years ago, critics charged that it helped raise
the value of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   In London and later at the Hamburger Bahnhof in Berlin, Saatchi
paid only insurance costs. But in Brooklyn, he gave $160,000 to
help mount the show. The information turned up in court documents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Arnold L. Lehman, director of the Brooklyn Museum,
and his assistants solicited donations of at least $10,000 from
dealers who represent many of the artists in the show. The museum
also received a $50,000 contribution from Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Arnold Lehman that may be OK,'' said Kennedy, who added
that he had not talked to the Brooklyn Museum's director about his
decision to cancel the show. ``I didn't want to embroil him in my
decision,'' he said. ``He has his museum to run and I have mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman said in a telephone interview: ``I don't know anything
about their decision. I know they were very excited about having
the show, and I'm sure they are disappointed not to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery of Australia is a public museum. People
associated with it said that a public outcry there could well lead
to criticism from its government-appointed 11-member council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gallery had looked forward to engaging the Australian
public about issues in contemporary art and will now seek other
avenues in which to do so,'' Kennedy said. He said he was still
deciding what would replace ``Sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that ``Sensation'' will not be seen by other
audiences. Ms. Blyth said it was scheduled to open in March at the
Municipal Museum of Art in Toyota, northwest of Nagoya, Japan.

NORTHRIDGE SAYS COACHES WELCOME TO RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge athletic director Dick Dull
said two assistant football coaches who filed a $6 million legal
claim against the school are welcome to return to coaching next
season.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches, Craig Wall and Keith Borges, who have been teaching
physical education classes, expressed cautious optimism, but won't
formally respond until they talk to their attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Dull made his comments in light of a published report that Wall
and Borges filed a claim alleging retaliation because they
cooperated with an internal investigation of the football program
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Wall said the university did not allow the two to coach this
past season.
</P>
<P>
   The pair's move is the first step toward a formal lawsuit that
could be filed if the university doesn't respond to the claim,
which it received in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   Dull denied the school retaliated in any way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Borges and Wall) did what they were told. They have done
everything that's expected of them,'' Dull said. ``It's been
communicated to them (before the filing that) they are welcome to
come back and (fulfill) their responsibilities as assistant
coaches. They'll have to decide if it is in their best interests to
do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall and Borges, in separate interviews Tuesday, said they
received contracts last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They extended a contract to return to my position as defensive
coordinator,'' Wall said. ``That's exciting. That's the least I
would expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Borges was more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds positive,'' Borges said, ``but why did this come
three, four, five days ago and not three months ago?''
</P>
<P>
   Borges and Wall cooperated last summer with an internal
investigation into alleged abuses within the football program under
then-coach Ron Ponciano. A anonymous letter detailing misconduct
such as illegal barbecues and false expense reports sparked the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The university eventually fired Ponciano and soon after hired
Jeff Kearin as interim coach. Kearin assembled a coaching staff
that included just about all of Ponciano's assistants, who sources
have said were angry at Borges and Wall in the aftermath of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin said he is willing to have Wall and Borges on his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration says we comply with what the lawyers want
to do, and that's exactly what I will do,'' Kearin said. ``I
totally understand my place in the pecking order. If they want to
coach here, we'll sit down and work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   When he took over the program in July, Kearin said, he was told
he should call Wall about coaching. Kearin said he left a message
on Wall's answering machine but received no response. He never
tried to reach Borges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told he wasn't interested in coaching the football
team,'' Kearin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it odd someone's making a decision based on what they
heard,'' Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wall and Borges didn't coach, they were on the payroll
as coaches and kept their assistant-coach titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never refused to interview them. I've yet to lay eyes on
them since I got here in July,'' Kearin said. ``There's never been
any contact with them. . . . Money out of my budget paid their
salaries.''

3 EX-STUDENTS SUE RUTGERS OVER STRIPPING DURING BASKETBALL
PRACTICE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK _ Earl Johnson, the former Rutgers point guard, recalled
Tuesday that he initially thought a free-throw game that his coach,
Kevin Bannon, ordered the team to play two years ago _ in which
players were forced to remove an article of clothing after missing
a shot _ would be fun.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson, the 1996-97 Big East rookie of the year, said he
never thought Bannon would go all the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it got to the point where he wanted us to strip buck
naked, that wasn't funny,'' said Johnson, adding that he had to run
wind sprints naked through the school's gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Johnson filed a civil lawsuit against Rutgers; Bannon;
an assistant coach, Tod Kowalczyk; Robert E. Mulcahy III, the
current athletic director, and Fred Gruninger, who was the athletic
director at the time of the incident, saying the free-throw contest
violated state and federal civil rights statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Johnson in the lawsuit, filed in state Superior Court in
New Brunswick, were Josh Sankes, who played center for Rutgers, and
a student-manager of the basketball team, Juan Carlos Pla. Another
participant in the contest, Robert O'Connor, is still a team
manager and did not join the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The students are seeking unspecified monetary damages and
injunctive relief to force the school to implement a training
program to prevent the reoccurrence of similar misconduct in its
sports programs.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Sankes have admitted that other players walked off
the court and refused to participate in the drill, but said they
reluctantly went along with the game because they feared they might
lose their athletic scholarships, or in Pla's case, tuition
credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just stood there and didn't want to do it,'' Pla said during
a news conference at the Newark law offices of Ginarte, O'Dwyer,
Winograd &AMP; Laracuente, the firm representing the students. ``I
remember the coach was at a table with a cigar in his mouth
laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint alleges that the contest, which it called an
``abusive coaching method,'' was rigged in such a way to humiliate
players recruited by Bannon's predecessor, Robert Wenzel.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Sankes have since transferred to other schools.
Sankes enrolled at Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., in 1998, and
Johnson is attending Iona College in New Rochelle, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, David B. Scott,
counsel for Rutgers, said the university had not been served with a
complaint, nor had it ``even seen an advance copy of a complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``However, based on our athletic department's investigation,
when this matter first surfaced last summer and based on statements
in the press from the three complainants' attorney, the university
believes that any such lawsuit would be without legal merit, and
the university will defend it vigorously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bannon told university officials that the free-throw drill was
conducted to ``provide some levity and fun'' for the team during a
difficult period. He denied that the drill was mandatory, as
alleged in the complaint, and said everyone, including himself and
the plaintiffs, were laughing about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, no one was forced to remove his clothes or to
run,'' Bannon told The Record of Hackensack in August, when the New
Jersey newspaper first reported the contest.  &QL;

REPAYING A DEBT TO HOMER, FINDING SOLACE IN CATALLUS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 15 years covering conflicts from Central America to the
Balkans, I took last year off to study on a Nieman Fellowship at
Harvard University. Seeking a focus, I asked advice of the retired
president of Dartmouth, James O. Freedman, who recommended the
classics, including the study of Greek or Latin.
</P>
<P>
   I had studied biblical Greek as a seminarian, limping through it
with the aid of an eccentric tutor who lived in a tiny room filled
with tanks of tropical fish. To this day, Greek conjures up the
gurgle of air bubblesand the disconcerting glow of ultraviolet
light. I opted for Latin.
</P>
<P>
   But in following Freedman's advice, I was also repaying a debt
to Homer. I had a translation of the ``Iliad'' in my pocket when I
was taken prisoner by the Iraqi Republican Guard after the Persian
Gulf war. No other work captures the horror, capriciousness and
intoxication of war, especially war against civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in Homer, there is an affirmation of the human, of
compassion and gentleness.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing inherently redeeming or sacred, of course,
about ancient texts. The German and Italian fascists used and
misused classical literature, especially Virgil's ``Aeneid.'' The
Greeks and Romans embraced slavery, racial triumphalism, animal
sacrifice and infanticide. Democratic participation was the
prerogative of male citizens and was snuffed out for long periods
by tyrants and near-constant warfare.
</P>
<P>
   But the classics offer a continuum with Western literature,
architecture, art and political systems. The West's political and
social philosophy and intellectual achievements cannot, without the
classics, be examined thoughtfully. Nor without a classical
background can one fully grasp the nature of modern democracy whose
ideas were lifted from the Greek and Roman philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   Thucydides, knowing that Athens was doomed in the war with
Sparta, consoled himself with the belief that the artistic and
intellectual achievements of Athens would in the coming centuries
overshadow Spartan militarism. Beauty and knowledge could,
ultimately, triumph over power.
</P>
<P>
   As my year at Harvard progressed, I devoured the classical
authors in translation, but wasn't always as sure about taking on
another dead language. One of my teachers, Dr. Kathleen Coleman,
told me one morning that I needed a purpose behind my slog through
Latin. Once a week, she instructed, I would appear at her office
prepared to do a translation of a poem by Catullus or passage from
Virgil.
</P>
<P>
   I had never read Catullus, but swiftly came to love him.
</P>
<P>
   I retreated in the afternoons carrying my books to the Smyth
Classical Reading Room in the Widener Library with its huge oak
tables and sagging leather chairs. I was an imposter among the real
classicists, laying out my copy of Herodotus, the father not of
history, I suspect, but of tabloid journalism. But my fondest
moments revolve around this sanctuary with its well-thumbed
volumes. It was there that I was freed to step outside myself, to
struggle with questions the cant of modern culture often allows us
to ignore. I admired the past for its achievements and was better
able to question the present for its assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   All idylls must end. Mine was shattered on March 24, when NATO
began its bombing of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   I had come to Cambridge from Kosovo, and Kosovar Albanians I had
known for three years were now missing or found dead along
roadsides. I slept little. I was chained to the news reports. My
former translator, a published poet, vanished. I returned to Kosovo
last summer and her family was searching for her in mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   I had memorized in Latin a few of the Catullus poems and parts
of the ``Aeneid,'' and the words consoled and rescued me _ often
from myself. I held a communion now with the long dead.
</P>
<P>
   I woke one morning well before dawn haunted by a Catullus poem
written to Calvus, whose lover, Quintilia, had died. Calvus had
abandoned her, as I felt I had abandoned those in Kosovo, and his
grief was mingled with his guilt:
</P>
<P>
   If anything welcome or pleasing, Calvus, can be felt
</P>
<P>
   By silent tombs in answer to our grief,
</P>
<P>
   From that painful longing in which we renew old loves
</P>
<P>
   And weep for friendships we once cast away,
</P>
<P>
   Surely Quintilia does not lament her early death
</P>
<P>
   As much as she rejoices in your love.

DEMONSTRATIONS IMPEDE PROGRESS AT TRADE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to insert new 6th graf re response of Clinton's aides.) 
 (With TRADE-TALKS)

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Four members of President Clinton's Cabinet and
hundreds of other American officials came to Seattle this week to
push America's agenda on free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they spent Tuesday trying to negotiate their own free
passage.
</P>
<P>
   As demonstrators and tear gas mingled on the streets below, U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky was unable to leave her
hotel to start the four-day-long, 135-nation talks, which were
supposed to begin in an aging downtown theater. The Secret Service
would not let her into the streets. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and the secretary-general of the United Nations, Kofi
Annan, did not fare any better.
</P>
<P>
   And by midafternoon the ``millennium round'' of trade
negotiations that was supposed to start here this week was reduced
to a series of frantic telephone calls between hotels, as
Europeans, Asians, Africans and Americans who cannot see eye-to-eye
on trade could not even meet face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the midlevel American officials involved in the
negotiations ended up in the lobby of the Westin Hotel here sipping
lattes and waiting for security officials to signal that it was
clear for them to venture outdoors. But even then, there was no
assurance that they could get to various meeting sites, as hotels
were wringed by protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides here were clearly angered that the authorities
in Seattle, after a year to get ready, were unable to prepare a
secure corridor that would have enabled the negotiators to get to
their meetings. But in public they refused to directly criticize
the Seattle police. ``They faced a difficult situation, and
difficult choices,'' said Gene Sperling, the president's chief
economic adviser. ``At this point, none of us have enough facts to
criticize how they handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an embarrassing beginning to a set of negotiations that
the administration had once been reluctant to hold. Then, in a move
many American officials clearly regretted Tuesday, the White House
reversed position and Clinton volunteered to host the session here,
in hopes that launching the negotiations on home turf would give
Washington more sway over the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the focus has been on the streets instead of on the
talks. And it wasn't only downtown Seattle that was suffering from
gridlock. So were the negotiations. Europe and the United States
dug in their heels on one of the most contentious issues, an end to
Europe's huge subsidies for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, there was no real progress on one of the big
questions that the protesters were shouting about: getting the
World Trade Organization to regulate working conditions in
factories around the world. India has so far blocked any real
discussion of the issue, and American officials were scrambling,
cell phones permanently attached to their ears, to drum up some
allies in their struggle to get a ``working group'' within the WTO
that, for the first time in the history of trade talks, would make
labor conditions an explicit subject of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, all sides were trying to use the protests for
political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The French were delighted to see protesters echoe their longtime
complaint that free trade in agriculture hurts local farmers and
forces them to market foods of suspicious origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening outside is having an effect on the
negotiations,'' the European Union trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy,
said Tuesday. The American desire to eliminate government subsidies
in Europe that make it extraordinarily difficult for American
farmers to export their goods ``is even less possible'' given the
tenor of the protests, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The American delegation, milling in the lobby and conference
rooms of the Westin Hotel here, insisted that the protests
underscored the importance of moving labor rights to the top of the
WTO's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clear expression of concern by ordinary workers has to be
taken into consideration,'' said Sue Esserman, one of Ms.
Barshefsky's top deputies, who recently traveled to India in an
attempt to persuade its leaders that a discussion of labor rights
would ultimately be in their national interests. ``And that's
exactly what we have done,'' she said. Ms. Barshefsky herself
wasn't talking; her aides said she was glued to her telephone,
conferring with her foreign counterparts across town.
</P>
<P>
   American officials went to some lengths to argue Tuesday that
their work had not really been disrupted. The real give and take
goes on in back rooms and over the phone anyway, they noted, as
countries try to protect their most powerful constituencies and
search for trade-offs. ``We are using all the time available,'' Ms.
Esserman said, though she acknowledged that ``the lines are
jammed'' because hotel switchboards were overloaded.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Barshefsky was working the phones, the ministerial
meeting of the WTO began without her and without the Europeans.
Mike Moore, the former boxer and prime minister of New Zealand who
is now director general of the WTO, announced Tuesday afternoon
that ``this has not stopped our work. We are already meeting and
discussing our negotiations.'' But without two of the world's
biggest economic powerhouses in attendance, it was a bit like
beginning an opera with the soprano and the tenor stuck in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the thousands of trade officials here saw the
activity in the streets as the cacophony of democracy, a few
suspected that there was a deeper conspiracy at work. One
ambassador of a developing nation, who insisted on anonymity, said
he was certain that the Clinton administration had orchestrated the
protests in hopes of shortening the time for real negotiation.
That, in turn, would put pressure on smaller nations to give in, he
said.

THE LABOR PAINS OF A LEFTIST MUSICAL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 David Schiff is a composer on the faculty of Reed College in
Portland, Ore.  
 By DAVID SCHIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the thousands who cheered it in the late 1930s, Marc
Blitzstein's musical play ``The Cradle Will Rock'' blazed like a
comet of hope in the dark Depression skies. The millennium was far
away, but Armageddon was now.
</P>
<P>
   Germany was rearming, Mussolini had seized Ethiopia, and the
Spanish Civil War seemed like a dress rehearsal for a final
confrontation between Left and Right. The American economy was
again on the slide, and labor strife across the country was taken
as the beginnings of class warfare.
</P>
<P>
   A series of razor-sharp satirical songs, ``The Cradle Will
Rock'' presented these conflicts as a battle between the good of
unionized labor and the corruption of everyone else. It opened on
June 16, 1937, under circumstances so dramatic that Orson Welles,
who had directed the production, later wrote a screenplay about the
show's creation. But it was never filmed; and as times changed,
``The Cradle'' disappeared into the recesses of cultural outer
space.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Robbins, who has taken on politically charged subjects in
his previous films ``Dead Man Walking'' and ``Bob Roberts,'' brings
Blitzstein's show back to life in his new movie, ``Cradle Will
Rock,'' opening on Friday in New York City. Not simply a cinematic
rendering of Blitzstein's play, or the story of its premiere, the
film is a panoramic view of New York in the Depression years,
filled with such historical characters as Nelson Rockefeller, Diego
Rivera, Frida Kahlo, William Randolph Hearst, Margherita Sarfatti
(Mussolini's former mistress who wrote pro-Fascist stories for
Hearst) and the young Orson Welles, a fireball of theatrical
energy.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing fact and fiction and blending the directorial styles of
Welles and Preston Sturges, Robbins surrounds the story of the
show's birth with a web of plot lines about artists and patrons and
timeless questions of opportunism, compromise and integrity _ and
just putting on a show.
</P>
<P>
   Though his music is rarely performed today, Marc Blitzstein
revolutionized American musical theater, and not just politically.
Critics and composers have recognized that he created a new idiom,
distinct from the Broadway musical and European opera.
</P>
<P>
   His style sprang from popular music yet kept a sharp edge of
satire and psychological insight. In ``The Cradle,'' he leans
heavily on the manner of Kurt Weill (who referred to it, somewhat
bitterly, as ``my latest show''), but later he developed a lyrical,
jazzy melodic style of his own. His influence has permeated the
genre for the last 60 years, especially in the works of Leonard
Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Blitzstein, played by Hank Azaria, composes ``The
Cradle'' as a man possessed. ``I read that he worked in a state of
white-hot inspiration,'' Robbins says, ``and that gave me the image
of Blitzstein's character.'' Indeed, driven by the political ideas
of his wife, Eva Goldbeck, who died of anorexia in May 1936, and of
Bertolt Brecht, Blitzstein wrote the words and music for ``The
Cradle'' in just five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A political soul-mate to the homosexual Blitzstein, Goldbeck had
introduced the composer to Brecht's writings, and to Brecht. Before
her death, the composer had played Brecht his song ``Nickel Under
the Foot'' _ which tells of a woman forced by poverty into
prostitution. According to Blitzstein's biographer, Eric Gordon,
Brecht said, ``Why don't you write a piece about all kinds of
prostitution _ the press, the church, courts, the arts, the whole
system?'' Despondent after his wife's death, Blitzstein recalled
Brecht's advice and feverishly set to work.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with ``I'm Checking Home Now,'' sung by the Moll, a
hungry prostitute, ``The Cradle'' goes on to skewer the hypocrisy
of the Establishment of Steeltown U.S.A., which dances to the tune
called by Mister, owner of the steel mill, and his overstuffed
family. The preacher advocates peace or war depending on the price
of steel, a journalist defends his antiunion distortions as
``freedom of the press,'' a painter and violinist describe their
dependence on Mrs. Mister's patronage as ``art for art's sake,'' a
doctor falsifies medical records to help the police, and a college
president fires pacifists who will not endorse ROTC. The two
younger Misters fill their empty lives with marshmallow pop tunes.
</P>
<P>
   The only incorruptible character is Larry Foreman, a
middle-class union supporter who rejects Mister's attempt at
bribery and predicts the downfall of the social order and the
coming triumph of unionism with the fiery anthem ``The Cradle Will
Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Orson Welles and John Houseman, who had already directed and
produced three shows for the Federal Theater Project, including an
all-black ``Macbeth'' in Harlem, brought Blitzstein's musical to
Hallie Flanagan, the project's head. She decided to present ``The
Cradle'' even though she was under attack in Congress for promoting
left-wing ideas. Citing Blitzstein's show as proof that the Federal
Theater Project was fomenting revolution, Congress cut its funds by
30 percent. In the film, as in the actual hearings, congressmen
brand Euripides and Christopher Marlowe as Communists.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the public dress rehearsal (with full orchestra
and an elaborate set), the Works Progress Administration, the
financing umbrella for the Theater Project, canceled ``The Cradle''
for lack of funds and padlocked the theater. Houseman quickly found
an empty theater, the Venice, 20 blocks away. Word got out that the
premiere would be moved, and the cast and an audience packed with
union members _ Virgil Thomson wrote that the leftwing audience was
``the most formidable army of ticket buyers in the world'' _ walked
uptown. One obstacle remained. Actors Equity and the Musicians
Union would not let their members perform at the Venice.
</P>
<P>
   Houseman and Welles explained the problem to the audience, and
Blitzstein came out on a bare stage to narrate and sing his work at
the piano. But as he began the Moll's song, Olive Stanton rose from
the audience to play her role, soon followed by the rest of the
cast, who were all seated in the theater and were risking their
jobs with the Federal Theater by taking part. Art seemed to spring
miraculously from life, and the evening ended with jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was less interested in the show,'' Robbins says, ``than in
the impact it had on people's lives, and the way it helped them
understand the world around them.'' He centers his film on two of
the actors in the show, the actual Olive Stanton, played by Emily
Watson, and the fictional Aldo Silvano (John Turturro), an
Italian-American anti-Fascist. Stanton, a homeless woman who had
never been on stage before, found a job as a stagehand with the
Federal Theater Project, then took possession of the role of the
Moll as if it were her birthright.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins says he invented fictions to connect facts: ``Where
there was an A and a C, I created a B.'' During rehearsals for
``The Cradle,'' the film's Silvano, a struggling young actor,
breaks with his parents because of their support of Mussolini. At
the actual premiere, an audience member tore down the Italian
Fascist flag hanging in the Venice Theater. Robbins gives that
defining act to Silvano, who adds his own political passion to
Larry Foreman's electrifying pro-union tirade.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Performing in ``The Cradle'' despite the economic disaster sure
to follow, Stanton and Silvano fuse their theatrical and political
vocations.
</P>
<P>
   A piano on a bare stage and a cast emerging from the audience
have become essential to performances of ``The Cradle,'' even
though Blitzstein had never imagined it that way. (For the film,
David Robbins, the director's brother, has rescored the music for a
klezmerish quintet.) Both Welles and Houseman later claimed that
they had instructed the cast to create the illusion of a
spontaneous performance.
</P>
<P>
   The movie script originally had Welles eloquently instructing
the cast on how to make their entrances; but when he learned that
members of the cast had recalled acting on their own, Robbins
rewrote the scene as a spontaneous show of political courage.
</P>
<P>
   As counterpoint to these stories of integrity, there are two
subplots about treachery and self-betrayal: the story of the
destruction of Diego Rivera's Rockefeller Center murals (which
actually took place in 1934) and an account of the decline and fall
of a fictional ventriloquist employed by the Theater Project.
</P>
<P>
   The young Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack) commissioned Rivera
(Ruben Blades) to paint a mural for the centerpiece of his family's
contribution to the Manhattan skyline, after Picasso and Matisse
had turned him down. When Rivera refused to remove the face of
Lenin from the mural, ``Man at the Crossroads,'' Rockefeller
canceled the commission, paid Rivera handsomely and had the murals
jack-hammered off the walls.
</P>
<P>
   The film shows Rockefeller announcing that from then on he would
promote only nonpolitical art _ abstractions and nudes. It's a sly
joke at the expense of the Museum of Modern Art, which was built
with Rockefeller money and which still promotes an apolitical view
of modernism as a series of aesthetic innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his credentials as a political filmmaker, Robbins has
tried to balance political and nonpolitical characters in the film.
``Welles didn't buy into the absolutism of politics,'' Robbins
says. ``He embraced celebrity and bacchanalia, arriving at the
theater in an ambulance after partying all night in Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   The ventriloquist, played by Bill Murray, also seems to be
non-political at first. But when he sides with the enemies of the
Theater Project, his dummy turns on him, denounces his hypocrisy
and dies. Robbins crosscuts the post-performance celebration for
``The Cradle'' with the dummy's funeral march.
</P>
<P>
   This slice of magic realism springs from fact. One of the
Theater Projects' most successful productions was ``Pinocchio.''
When Congress shut down the program in 1939, the cast placed the
puppet in a coffin and marched up Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Blitzstein's musical play received accolades from critics
spanning the political spectrum _ from The Daily Worker to Walter
Winchell. The entire score was recorded _ the first original cast
album of a Broadway musical (available now on a Pearl CD).
</P>
<P>
   Welles and Houseman went on to produce ``The Cradle'' on their
own, touring steel towns and then returning to New York in January
1938 for a 13-week run. Productions popped up across the country,
including one at Harvard, produced, directed and performed at the
piano by the 20-year-old Leonard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the avid support of Bernstein and Aaron Copland,
Blitzstein became a neglected figure in the history of American
music, remembered mainly as the translator of Brecht's ``Three
Penny Opera.'' His 1949 opera ``Regina,'' based on Lillian
Hellman's ``Little Foxes,'' was praised after its premiere as ``the
most exciting music theater since `Rosenkavalier.''' But it has yet
to claim a place in the repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Blitzstein, who was murdered in 1964 at age 58 by three sailors
he had met in a bar in Martinique, left three theater pieces
incomplete, including an opera about Sacco and Vanzetti he was
writing for the Metropolitan.
</P>
<P>
   Blitzstein's work was always politically charged and far to the
left, though the caricatures in ``The Cradle'' will not alarm
anyone familiar with ``The Simpsons.'' In both the ``The Cradle''
and Blitzstein's next musical play, ``No for an Answer,'' he
integrated dialogue and singing as no American had done before: the
music continues the dramatic action so effectively that the
audience barely notices the transitions from speech to song.
</P>
<P>
   Blitzstein's shows may have languished and his hard line proved
unpersuasive, but without ``The Cradle Will Rock'' there would have
been no ``On the Town,'' ``Trouble in Tahiti,'' ``Wonderful Town,''
``Candide'' or ``West Side Story.'' Indeed, two songs from ``West
Side Story'' _ ``Officer Krupke'' and ``A Boy Like That'' _ are
pure Blitzstein; ``America'' is Blitzstein plus Copland; and
Bernstein even lifted the melody of ``Maria'' from ``Regina.''
</P>
<P>
   You can hear Blitzstein in Jud Fry's song, ``Lonely Room,'' from
``Oklahoma!'' And Blitzstein's mordant, sleazy melodies are the
models for ``Cabaret'' and ``Sweeney Todd.''
</P>
<P>
   Free of the necessity (or even possibility) of producing hit
tunes, and once again drawn to themes of social unrest, today's
generation of music theater composers will find Blitzstein's work
more relevant than ever _ even in the ``miracle'' economy of the
late '90s. And so, Robbins hopes, will the movie audience. ``They
are still censoring art today,'' he says. ``And there are still
individuals who exercise their freedom of expression, and pay the
price.''

WTO FINALLY UNDER WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ At mid-morning Tuesday, Shyh-bao Lai of Taiwan stood
at the downtown Seattle Sheraton Hotel, blocked at Pine Street by a
chain of protesters. ``This is democracy? Shutting us out?'' he
exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, protesters shut out almost everyone from the site of
official meetings of the World Trade Organanization, including
people inclined to agree with them. ``We've come with quite a
progressive agenda,'' said Belgian delegate Gaetane Nihoul of the
Green Party, who stood frustrated on a Seattle street.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters who had vowed to shut down the WTO conference
succeeded in that aim, at least for a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Talks finally began by mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates opened the serious work by dividing Tuesday afternoon
into five groups: agriculture, market opening, implementation and
rules, transparency (opening up the WTO's process), and new issues
_ such as labor, environment and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also evident that the demonstrators succeeded in
getting themselves heard within the Convention Center's walls.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said the
protesters spoke for values that the Clinton Administration wants
the WTO to embrace, including open procedures, labor rights and
protection of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the message to take from the protests, not the
violence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   European Union Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy said he understood
the protest. ``They have some belief that trade liberalization
works against what they care about,'' he said. ``They have to be
answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Albright, U.S. Secretary of State, said, ``We have
learned from history that attempts to stifle trade through
protectionism and closed markets usually backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   WTO Director-General Mike Moore said critics were wrong to label
the WTO undemocratic, because most of the delegates were sent by
democratic governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 100 ministers who want to engage on behalf of
their people,'' he said. ``It should be the right of our ministers
to sit around a table as equals and try and settle their
differences and try to build a more just system.''
</P>
<P>
   The protests clearly did not prevent the main work of the
meetings from being done. Albright met with Japan's foreign
minister, Yohei Kono, and discussed agriculture and anti-dumping
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Each side continued to set out its positions. EU negotiator Lamy
said Europe agrees that labor and the environment should be
considered in trade agreements. The United States agrees. But the
low-wage countries don't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developing countries can only compete with lower wages,'' said
a Costa Rican delegate.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants an end to all export subsidies for farm
products. So does the Cairns Group of food exporting countries,
which includes Canada and Australia. Japan is willing to end export
subsidies, but wants to keep its protected market for rice, which
sells at six times the world price.
</P>
<P>
   That is a matter, a spokesman said, of ``food security,''
because Japan grows only 38 percent of the grains it eats.
</P>
<P>
   Lamy of the EU said ending all farm subsidies is an idea that
``just won't float.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, home of most of the dot-com companies, wants
to extend an agreement for zero tariffs on videos, texts and other
products that cross borders electronically. One supporter is the
WTO's newest member, Estonia. Its foreign minister, Toomas Ilves,
said his country has more Internet users than half the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's big priority with the United States is to reopen the
agreement on anti-dumping, because it says the United States is
using the law in an abusive way. South Korea, India and others
agree. But according to a Japanese source, Albright told Kono that
a substantial tightening of anti-dumping rules ``would invite a
huge political backlash in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan and the European Union are willing to cut tariffs to zero
on almost all products from the poorest countries. Barshefsky said
the United States will go along on most commodities _ but not
textiles.
</P>
<P>
   For Geoffrey Mkandawire, chief trade officer for Malawi, the No.
1 priority is market access for textiles.
</P>
<P>
   Patteson Oti, minister of foreign affairs of the Solomon
Islands, worries about negotiating with the big powers. ``It's like
boxing,'' he said. ``You can level the ring. But if you put Mike
Tyson in as an opponent, you know what the outcome will be. What we
need is equal fitness.''
</P>
<P>
   How it all would work out was far from clear.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky said she expects agreement on some issues by
Wednesday. The toughest issue is agriculture, but she said she
expects some sort of a declaration on that by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, the Seattle Democrat and longtime champion
of trade with Africa, said the final deal probably won't be reached
``until the middle of the night Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the protests, McDermott said, ``They are not going to stop
the World Trade Organization. They may slow it down for a little
while, but it's going to go on. They're not going to stop
globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Mwansa Musonda, a Zambian who works for the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa, said he understood where the
protesters were coming from, but only to a point. ``There are a lot
of half-truths,'' he said. ``I see the same type of thing back
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Finnish delegate Peter Boldt of the Central Organization of
Finnish Trade Unions said the protest was a good thing. ``I used to
do it in the 60s, in the streets,'' he said. ``Of course this is a
little bit irritating, but eventually these protests will lead to
more of a social agenda in the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   The protests did succeed in changing some delegates view of
Americans. Said Muhammad Sulaiman of Pakistan, looking over at
colored banners and a large stuffed head, ``We thought at least in
the U.S., everybody was for free trade. Obviously not.''

   NEW YORK _ One hates to muck about in sensationalism before a
fellow is even in office _ in this case, before a fellow has even
declared for office _ but there is an obligation to the voters.
</P>
<P>
   So let us discuss with the Slovenian model Melania Knauss the
notorious interview that she and boyfriend Donald Trump, who is
``exploring'' a run for the presidency, recently did with Howard
Stern. The phone interview during which Ms. Knauss was reportedly
naked and in which Trump bragged about their sex life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that became everything so fast,'' says Ms. Knauss
(pronounced Kuh-NAUS), in an Eastern European accent that can
render scrambled eggs caviar. ``It was like a comedy show. People
who hear it direct from the radio show, it was completely different
from the next day in the newspaper how they quoted. It was fun. ''
</P>
<P>
   Did Ms. Knauss do the interview naked?

   ``He did ask me what I'm wearing and I said, `Not much' and it
was quoted that I am nude. Then he was asking Donald, `Does she
have cellalite?''' Struggling with the pronunciation of cellulite.
`` `Shallalite?' He says, `Howard, she doesn't even know what the
cellalite is,' because I don't deal with the cellalite. I know what
it means, but they quote it like I don't know what the word means,
like I don't understand English.''
</P>
<P>
   But her boyfriend talked about their sex life on the air.
</P>
<P>
   A shrug, a conspiratorial woman-to-woman grin. ``It's the man
thing, that's how the man talks.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Trump a lucky billionaire or what? He's got a woman who does
not simply stand by her man, but over him. (Five feet 10{ inches,
but over 6 feet in her spiky Manolo Blahniks.) A 26-year-old model,
she has done Vogue covers in Europe. She also speaks four
languages.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Knauss, who maintains her own one-bedroom apartment, does
not wish to talk about something, like income or previous
relationships or George W. Bush, she will not talk, declining
charmingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not comfortable to talk about that.'' Pause, playful grin,
flash of the approachable, friendly style that Trump's political
consultant, Roger Stone, said is making Ms. Knauss an asset on the
exploratory trail. ``Thank you for asking.''
</P>
<P>
   Other questions, she has no problem with.
</P>
<P>
   What does she like about this old guy with the funny hair?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very successful businessman, he's very charming. He's
very smart, the energy between us is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times/CBS News poll in early November reported that
70 percent of Americans had an unfavorable opinion of Trump _ a
record, of sorts. He was less popular than Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still the beginning. Maybe it will be 70 plus in
February.''
</P>
<P>
   Piaget gold-and-diamond ladies' watches, by the way, start at
$17,000. Ms. Knauss started in Slovenia, which declared its
independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 in a largely bloodless 10-day
war. If you are picturing a financially difficult life for Ms.
Knauss, however, you are wrong. Ms. Knauss' family was prosperous;
her father managed a chain of car and motorcycle dealerships, her
mother was a fashion designer. The family skied in Austria and
Slovenia; in summer they went to the shore. Ms. Knauss, who has an
older sister, started modeling at five. She graduated from the
Academy of Design and Architecture in Ljubljana at 19, bounced
between Paris and Milan, modeling.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, she came to New York, where work included
catalogs for Bergdorf Goodman and Lord &AMP; Taylor, a Concord Watch
campaign. At a party a little over a year ago, Ms. Knauss met
Trump. The attraction, she says, was immediate, although when he
asked for her number she declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a girl who will just give away the number to
anybody,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later she called him. They have dated since. Trump's
public ways, which might seem to some women to suggest the
objectification of women _ ``Where's my supermodel?'' Trump yelled
from the stage at a ``town hall'' meeting at the University of
Pennsylvania _ do not trouble her.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does she admit to being bothered by the not uncommon
suggestions of gold diggery that sometimes accompany young women
who date wealthy older men; by a New York Post cartoon, after the
Howard Stern interview, which pictured Ms. Knauss in bed with
Trump, with a thought bubble in the form of a dollar sign over her
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press could be sometimes very mean,'' Ms. Knauss says.
``They love to make a joke, that's how they're selling the
newspapers. But I think you can't be with the person if it's not
love, if they don't satisfy you. You can't hug a beautiful
apartment, you can't hug an airplane, you can't talk to them.''
</P>
<P>
   What would Ms. Knauss' role be should she and Trump ever end up
in The White House?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very traditional. Like Betty Ford or Jackie
Kennedy. I would support him.''

ITS SHARE PRICE SAGGING, CONSECO REFOCUSES ON ITS BALANCE SHEET 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS    
 c .1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conseco Inc., an insurance holding company with a sagging stock
price, announced a reversal of strategy Tuesday, promising to
improve its balance sheet while slowing its rate of growth. It
slashed its common stock dividend and agreed to raise $478 million
by selling convertible preferred stock on extraordinarily generous
terms to a private investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy brought immediate rewards for Conseco, whose
stock price rose $1.6875 to $20.25. Moody's Investors Service said
that when the investment by the investment firm, the Thomas H. Lee
Co., is completed next month, it would raise the company's rating
from the junk bond level to investment grade. Other bond rating
services already give the bonds an investment grade.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements came a day after Conseco stock traded as low
as $18.50, a three-year low and a 68 percent decline from its peak
of $58.125, reached in the spring of 1998. In the three and
one-half years leading up to that high, the stock price had risen
more than 500 percent as Conseco grew rapidly through acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The dividend cut, from 15 cents a quarter to five cents, came
only four months after the payout was raised from 14 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price decline has been intensely frustrating to
Stephen H. Hilbert, Conseco's chairman, chief executive and
president, who noted Tuesday that the company has never missed a
quarterly earnings target. ``Conseco has not had an earnings
problem,'' he said in a conference call with analysts. ``It's had a
multiple problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Conseco's stock price has been hurt by suspicions that it
overpaid to acquire Green Tree Financial last year for $7.6 billion
in stock. That company, since renamed Conseco Finance, specializes
in mobile home loans. Part of Tuesday's announcement was a plan to
slow the growth in that business, a decision that Hilbert said
would enable the company to make loans that were more profitable
and less risky, although he said there was no problem with its
loans now.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco said that it now expects operating earnings of $2.80 a
share in 2000, rather than the $3 it had previously forecast, but
Hilbert added that those earnings would rise to $3.50 in 2001 and
grow by more than 20 percent in 2002. Conseco's closing stock price
Tuesday was just seven times the revised 2000 earnings target, a
figure that is far below that of most companies.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 earnings forecast was already below the $3.17 expected
by Wall Street for 1999, but that decline was due to a change to
more conservative accounting policies at Conseco Finance. A Conseco
spokesman said earnings for this year would have been about $2.16 a
share had the accounting change been made before the year began.
</P>
<P>
   As Conseco's stock price has fallen, a major issue has been cash
flow _ specifically whether enough cash would be coming in to the
parent company to meet its obligations, including those to
creditors. Hilbert told analysts that the company had projected it
would have just enough cash next year, but that the changes
announced Tuesday _ including a $135 million annual savings in
dividend payments _ would mean that it had twice as much cash as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Hilbert said Conseco's merits had ``been overlooked because of
the bears on the street spreading one ridiculous rumor after
another that cash was an issue here.'' He added that ``Cash flow
has not been a problem, but it has certainly been enhanced.'' He
forecast that Conseco's bond rating would be raised further as the
company's financial flexibility increased.
</P>
<P>
   The investment by Thomas H. Lee Co., a firm known for investing
in troubled financial companies, will give it $500 million in
preferred stock, convertible into common at $19.25 a share. Lee
will pay $500 million, but immediately get back about $11 million
in fees from Conseco for arranging the deal. Another $11 million in
fees will go to other bankers and lawyers, a Lee spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco said the preferred was priced to convert at a 4 percent
premium to Monday's closing stock price, but the terms appear to
actually be more generous to Lee. Not only does Lee effectively pay
less than full price because of the fees, but it will get more and
more shares as time goes by. The preferred carries a 4 percent
yield, but only a fraction of that will be in cash, with the rest
to be in additional preferred shares.
</P>
<P>
   If the preferred issue were to be converted in three years, the
earliest that Conseco can force conversion, it would be convertible
to about 28.4 million shares. That would mean an effective
conversion price, based on an original investment of $489 million,
of $16.84 a share.
</P>
<P>
   That contrasts with the average price of $40.80 a share that
Conseco paid to buy back 15.7 million shares of stock, for $641.3
million, in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As Conseco's share price has fallen, criticism has risen on Wall
Street of the company's unusual stock plan. Under the plan, Conseco
guaranteed loans made to officers and directors for the purchase of
company stock. The company also paid the interest on the loans. The
most unusual provision was that if the company were sold, the
executives and directors would not lose money. If the executives
paid more for the stock, including interest on the loans, than they
garnered in a sale, the company would pick up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   But last month the company changed that provision, so that top
officers and directors now could lose money if the company were
sold at a low price. The guarantee against losses would still apply
to lower-level officers, said Jim Rosensteele, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Hilbert retains another unusual provision that would kick in if
the company were sold. He has options to buy 7.2 million shares at
prices ranging from $30.81 to $50.69. Those options are now out of
the money, but if the company were to be acquired at any price, the
exercise prices would be reduced to zero, according to a filing by
Hilbert with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to compensate
him ``for loss of the potential future speculative value of the
unexercised options.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Hilbert took what amounted to a pay cut,
however. He agreed that his annual bonus _ which was $13.5 million
a year in 1998 _ would be paid in stock valued at $50 a share. With
the stock now trading for about 40 percent of that price, the
change amounts to a 60 percent reduction in his bonus.

WEBSIDE, CLUBS AND A $5 MILLION FUND HELP A CREATIONIST SPREAD THE
WORD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Ky., Kan., Okla, N.Mex.)   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Ky. _ Since dedicating himself to creationism 20 years
ago when he was a disillusioned science teacher in Australia, Ken
Ham has found that progress generally can be slow, but hardly as
slow as his evolutionist adversaries would have the world believe.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to America five years ago, Ham, a dedicated
Christian fundamentalist with an Abe Lincoln gaze to his musings
about the origin of life, now directs a $5-million-a-year
enterprise and claims to have 110 ``creation clubs'' in schools
across the country. He expects more as he spreads the literal word
according to Genesis _ that creation was a divine accomplishment in
six days _ and tries to debunk the teaching of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   This would seem an uphill struggle, but Ham takes comfort that
the phones and Web site of his nonprofit organization, Answers in
Genesis Inc., are still busy with the stir created by creationism's
biggest victory to date _ the Kansas Board of Education's decision
last August to yield to growing pressure and delete virtually any
mention of evolution from the state's science curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   This was followed last month by the decision of state education
officials here in Kentucky to eliminate the word ``evolution'' but
not the scientific theory of evolution from the school curriculum
and to substitute the phrase ``change over time.'' In Oklahoma,
officials recently ordered that textbooks must bear a disclaimer
about the certainty of evolution. On the other hand, New Mexico's
Board of Education voted last month to bar creationism and
overwhelmingly endorse evolution in the science curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole battle is hotting up,'' Ham summarized amid some
glaring, gaping full-sized dinosaur models scattered about his
headquarters like an oddly dissenting chorus on the phylogenetic
scale. Ham uses the mystery about the sudden disappearance of
dinosaurs from creation as an argument against evolution. He is
planning to build a creationist museum north of here near
Cincinnati, full of naturalist displays presenting ``creation
science'' arguments that creation was accomplished 6,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Under the theory of evolution, rooted in a myriad of fossil,
anatomic and genetic evidence, the scientific consensus is that
life began on earth around 3.9 billion years ago, with humans and
other species evolving from a common ancestor. Ham has his own
staff of scientists arguing to the contrary in heavily foot-noted
monographs challenging the reliability of carbon-dating and other
underpinnings of modern science.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a culture war hotting up in America between Christian
morality and relative morality, which is really the difference
between a creation-based philosophy and an evolution-based one,''
said Ham, who argues that if the word ``day'' in Genesis' account
of creation is allowed to be taken metaphorically to encompass eons
and to blur divinity's role, then the Bible is made fallible and
morality reduced to human whim.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not America is ready for such a culture war of words,
Ham is. His group claims 140,000 on its mailing list and more than
3,000 visitors a day to its Web site at www.answersingenesis.org. H
says the organization is growing as political leaders are more
tempted to tinker with accepted notions about evolution. Supported
by donations and fees on a wide array of handsomely produced
recordings and publications, Answers in Genesis holds seminars
across the country, offering counterarguments to evolution. It
offers not outright Christian fundamentalism, but ``a supplement to
the church,'' in Ham's view.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers who sponsor the creation clubs must sign a commitment
to ``the inerrant word of God.'' As a nonprofit group, his
organization does not lobby government. But it presents information
to anyone who asks, and Ham happily claims that some Kansas
officials involved in the curriculum decision are quite familiar
with his publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very encouraged,'' said Ham, the director of one of the
nation's two dominant creationist groups. The other is the
Institute for Creation Research in San Diego, where Ham once
worked. He decided to strike out on his own into what he says is a
growing field of intellectual challenge, but what his critics say
is a fundamentalist protest niche far more lucrative than
enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a rash of statewide problems,'' said Eugenie
Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science
Education, the main grass-roots science group active against
creationism, with 4,000 members. While creation clubs are entitled
to free speech, Ms. Scott said, they prepare adherents with
flurries of classroom challenges that ``tend to discourage the
teaching of evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   In reaction to creationist assaults, the National Science
Teachers Association, with 53,000 teachers, has begun holding
information sessions at its state conventions this fall to prepare
teachers to lead their communities in defending evolution as vital
to a proper education.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Rosenbaum, a Kentucky science teacher, rankles at ``change
over time'' as the state's official new euphemism for evolution. He
expects his state Science Teachers Association, of which he is
executive director, will soon come out firmly behind evolution.
``Put a nail outside and it will rust,'' Rosenbaum commented,
teacherlike. ``That's change over time. But is it evolution?''
</P>
<P>
   Ham is only further encouraged by the evolutionists' rallying to
their cause as his own speaking engagements grow. ``I was trained
in a Christian home by a father always prepared to defend his faith
in a logical way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him do that over and over against liberal theology,''
said Ham, confidently patting the synthetic hide of a large
dinosaur being prepared for the future museum of creationism. The
information card of the extinct creature offered the standard
natural history pedigree, with an added notation: ``Created Day
Six.''

STATE CITES RACIAL INEQUALITY IN NYC POLICE SEARCHES
</HEADLINE>
 (bl)  
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Blacks and Hispanics are much more likely than whites
to be stopped and searched by New York City police officers, even
when the numbers are adjusted to reflect higher crime rates in some
neighborhoods where members of minority groups live, according to a
report released Tuesday by the state attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said the findings confirmed
blacks' and Hispanics' perceptions that they are disproportionately
targeted by police, who have made such questioning on the street a
pivotal tactic in reducing crime.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials faulted the report's methodology Tuesday,
calling it ``terribly flawed,'' although the analysis was prepared
with the help of researchers at Columbia University's Center for
Violence Research and Prevention and was reviewed by an independent
expert at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said his study clearly demonstrated racial inequity in
police searches, but he said he was not accusing the Police
Department of racial profiling. ``Racial profiling is all about
intent,'' he said. ``We were careful in this report not to
speculate about any motivations or intent that may underlie the
disparities in this report.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials have defended the use of street searches as
part of an effort to catch criminals as they prepare to commit or
flee crimes. The program has often been cited as one of the ways
the city has been able to reduce the number of illegal guns on the
street. The courts have allowed officers to make the searches as
long as they have a reasonable suspicion, like a bulging waistband
that may betray the presence of a gun.
</P>
<P>
   But Spitzer said that although he endorses them as a
crime-fighting strategy, overuse of the street searches in some
areas had created resentment and mistrust of police among blacks
and Hispanics. Included in the 178-page report, alongside table
after table of statistics, were several anecdotes of blacks and
Hispanics who said they had been humiliated when police stopped and
searched them for no apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have good, tough policing and a lower crime rate
without infringing on people's basic constitutional rights,''
Spitzer said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Police Commissioner Howard Safir characterized Spitzer's
release of the report as an attempt to attract the attention of the
news media, not foster substantive reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had he shared with us his information before he shared it with
the press,'' Safir said, ``we could have pointed out to him that
the basis for stop-and-frisks is not the race of the individual as
determined by the police officer but the race of the individual as
determined by the description from the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, the first comprehensive analysis of the search
program by an outside agency, reviewed records from 175,000
incidents in which citizens were stopped by the police during the
15-month period that ended in March. The review was precipitated by
the police shooting of Amadou Diallo, a West African immigrant who
was killed in a barrage of 41 bullets by four officers assigned to
the Street Crime Unit, which conducts 10 percent of all street
searches in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo killing, in which the officers stand charged with
second-degree murder, set off months of demonstrations in which the
police were accused of trampling the civil rights of blacks and
Hispanics in their zeal to curb crime. Many critics said they were
particularly upset by what they described as the indiscriminate and
routine searches of people in predominantly minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The most basic finding of Spitzer's eight-month study was that
blacks were six times more likely to be stopped than whites.
Hispanics were four times more likely to be stopped, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, for example, made up 25 percent of the city population
but 50 percent of the people stopped. Whites, by comparison, made
up 43 percent of the population but were stopped only 13 percent of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials have long contended that the disparity is based
on the fact that most people are stopped in poor, high-crime
neighborhoods, many of which have a majority black and Hispanic
residents. But the attorney general's analysis found that, even
when the statistics were adjusted to take account of the higher
crime rate in some neighborhoods where large numbers of blacks and
Hispanics live, the number stopped still far exceeded the number of
whites stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Citywide, the study found that, after adjusting for crime,
Hispanics were 39 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
Blacks were 23 percent more likely to be stopped, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   To arrive at those percentages, and adjust for differing crime
rates among racial groups, the analysts compared how often members
of a particular race were stopped to how often they were arrested.
The analysis found that blacks and Hispanics were stopped at a rate
that was much higher than the rate at which they were arrested. The
rate at which whites were stopped was only slightly higher than the
rate at which they were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there were 1.5 stops of blacks for every black
arrested, but 1.2 stops of whites for every arrest. Analysts
calculated that blacks had a 23 percent greater chance of being
stopped than whites. The disparity was even greater for stops when
the police were seeking suspects in violent crimes, the study
found.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said Spitzer's report was flawed because the
analysis used arrest data from 1997 but stop-and-search figures
from 1998 and 1999. ``The underlying numbers that he uses are in
question,'' said Maureen Casey, deputy commissioner for policy and
planning.

ROBITAILLE MAY RETURN FOR DATE WITH DUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kings coach Andy Murray is conferring with the
team's schedule as much as team doctors in making a decision on the
return of injured left winger Luc Robitaille.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille, who scored 10 goals in the Kings' first 15 games,
appeared in a team scrimmage Tuesday for the first time since
learning he suffered a broken left foot 10 games ago. Murray has to
decide whether to play Robitaille on Friday in Anaheim against the
rival Ducks, or let him rest until a game against the expansion
Atlanta Thrashers five days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extra time obviously couldn't hurt the foot and it might
do him a lot of good,'' Murray said. ``When we get him back, we
need him back all the way. If that means keeping him out a couple
of days, I'm OK with that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Murray is not ignoring the importance of the upcoming game
in Anaheim, where the Kings have not played well in the past. But
after playing the Thrashers, the Kings go back on the road for a
four-game trip to Detroit, Montreal, New Jersey and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today will tell a lot about Luc,'' he said. ``We'll see how he
responds to the day after a tough workout. I'm sure he'll want to
go right away. But if we feel he's ready, he'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad news: Goalie Stephane Fiset, sidelined the past 3{ weeks
with a deep bruise in his right hand, experienced no improvement
Tuesday after five days of wearing a cast designed to immobilize
the injury.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem is not stopping shots, but gripping the
stick to clear the puck. Fiset, injured in warmups just before the
Oct. 6 loss to Philadelphia, was hoping Tuesday's practice would be
more encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very upset after practice,'' Murray said. ``At first
this looked like a 10-day kind of injury. Now it looks like six
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings goalie situation looked pretty bleak last week when
Jamie Storr was sidelined with a strained right groin. But Storr
returned after missing just one game and beat San Jose last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He will be in goal Friday against the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Quick whistles: Winger Dan Bylsma and defenseman Jaroslav Modry
will play tonight in Salt Lake for minor-league Long Beach but will
return to the Kings on Friday. If Robitaille can't go, Bylsma will
dress for the game. Modry will not. . . . Murray almost was late
for Tuesday's practice because of travel problems getting back from
his home in Minnesota. He spent the holidays with his family, but
his return flight was re-routed through Ontario. It was a $140 cab
fare to the Kings' Iceoplex training facility in the Valley.

The Tour Championship will be returning to Houston sooner than
expected.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The PGA Tour has reached a preliminary agreement with
representatives of Champions Golf Club to return the domestic
season-ending tournament for the top 30 money-winners to Houston in
2001, two years earlier than originally scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Because negotiations with several other sites around the country
yielded no satisfactory alternatives, the tour decided to return to
a proven commodity as the Tour Championship will be staged at
Champions for the fourth time in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have verbally agreed to have the Tour Championship return
to Champions in 2001,'' Earl Elliott, longtime board member of the
Houston Golf Association and one of the point men in the Tour
Championship's relationship with Champions, said Tuesday. ``There
still are some contract matters that need to be finalized, but it's
official in the sense that we have a verbal agreement between the
tour and Champions Golf Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Champions was under contract to host the Tour Championship in
2003. But the tournament will be played elsewhere that year since
it is returning to Houston in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the lure for bringing the elite tournament back to
Champions was the way the tournament was handled this year under
difficult circumstances. The HGA and officials at Champions werecited by the PGA Tour for their professionalism in the wake of
Payne Stewart's death in an airplane mishap Oct. 25, just three
days before the Tour Championship was to begin. The local parties
were responsible for setting up the Thursday morning tribute to
Stewart that included a bagpiper and was broadcast live nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout tournament week, the event went off as smoothly as
could be hoped for in the face of the tragedy, including a
suspension of play on Friday so that players could travel to
Orlando for the memorial service for Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, players at each of the past three Tour
Championships at Champions have raved about the golf course, which
is a more straightforward test of golf than many of the courses
they play during the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the original plan, Champions was to be included in a rotation
of four courses for the Tour Championship. The 2000 tournament will
be at East Lake Country Club in Atlanta. The Olympic Club in San
Francisco and Pinehurst No. 2 in Pinehurst, N.C., were expected to
be part of the regular rotation as well. But another Bay Area
course is under consideration, and it appears the tour will try to
formulate a rotation of six courses throughout the country for use
in the Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The game plan, according to sources, is to have two suitable
courses on the West Coast, two in the Midwest and two in the
Southeast, so that the tournament can start a six-year rotation
among those courses.
</P>
<P>
   Under this tentative plan, the Tour Championship would be back
at Champions in 2006 and 2012. Filling the other slots in the
rotation remains a work in progress for the tour.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that will not change is the involvement of the HGA in
the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The HGA will continue its strong association with the Tour
Championship,'' Elliott said. ``Originally, we were to have the
tournament here in 2003. But since we've moved up the date to 2001,
it's not likely we will have it again for another five years. But
we will be part of the rotation that is being formed.''
</P>
<P>
   With Houston likely to have the Tour Championship only once from
2002 through 2011, it could open the door for a Senior PGA Tour
event or an LPGA Tour event to get established during the fall
months. Finding a presenting sponsor and a non-profit organization
to run such a tournament are two hurdles that would have to be
cleared before any such event could become a reality.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 event will mark the fourth time the Tour Championship
has been at Champions. In October, Tiger Woods was victorious in
the tragedy-marred tournament. In 1997, David Duval was victorious,
and in 1990, Jodie Mudd earned the title in what was then the
Nabisco Championships.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 Tour Championship had a $5 million purse, with Woods
winning $900,000. The tournament also is expected to generate more
than $1 million for charity, although the amount has yet to be
finalized.
