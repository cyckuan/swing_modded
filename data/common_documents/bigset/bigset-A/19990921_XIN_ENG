<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges for Bold Decisions in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordan' Foreign
Minister Abdel-Elah Khatib urged here Monday the Middle East
countries to take bold decisions to achieve peace on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 54th session of the U.N. General Assembly,
Khatib said that the Mideast region now stands before a historic
opportunity which could not be lost in the search for a
comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that the leaders of the region will seize
this opportunity, live up to the expectations and aspirations of
their peoples and will not hesitate to take the bold decisions
needed to bring the negotiations to fruition," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the major players in the Middle East region,
enjoying good relations with most of the Arab countries and
Israel. It recently helped the Palestinians and Israelis negotiate
an agreement on further Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister showed special concern about the
Palestinian problem while urging for progress on the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
"We are directly concerned with their (Palestinians and
Israelis) success because issues on their agenda are linked to our
national interest, particularly the issues of the refugees, the
borders and Jerusalem," Khatib said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan says that the Palestinian refugees, making up a large
percentage of its total populace, has put immense pressures on its
resources and economy. Direct expenditures by Jordan on services
to the refugees equal the entire budget for the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency for the Palestine Refugees in the Middle
East (UNRWA).
</P>
<P>
Fearing that the UNRWA might allocate less money for the
refugees at the dawn of peace in the region, the Jordanian foreign
minister called on the donor countries to continue their financial
backing to the UNRWA.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israelis have agreed to try to seek a
solution to the refugee problem, one of the most thorny issues
between the two sides, at the final stage of negotiations. The
demarcation of borders and the status of Jerusalem, a city claimed
by both sides as capital, are to be settled in future
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Khatib voiced support for the resumption of Israeli
negotiations with Syria and Lebanon, sharing the view with the two
Arab capitals that talks be resumed from the point at which they
stopped.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzah
Rabin, the Syrians and Israelis had bargained about to what extent
the Israelis should withdraw from the Goland Heights. The
negotiations halted after Rabin was assassinated in 1995. Neither
headway was made on the Lebanese track.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian foreign minister said that his country was ready
to help the three parties to come back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
He also called for regional cooperation in tackling with
economic disparities, water and the environment as well as the
removal of weapons of mass destruction. "Unless they are solved,
they themselves will escalate and become new hotbeds of conflict
in the region," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Predicts Lower Economic Growth for Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Heavy burden of external debt
and largely unsustainable debt-service obligation, together with
continued difficulties in the external economy, pose a constraint
on the growth potential of African countries, said a U.N. report.
</P>
<P>
The I999 Trade and Development Report issued by the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development available in the Kenyan
capital Nairobi Monday said that in view of the bleak global
growth prospects, significant improvements in commodity markets in
Africa are not to be expected.
</P>
<P>
"Output growth for the region as a whole in 1999 may well be
marginally lower than last year. There are considerable downside
risks, including climate conditions and continuing civil
conflict," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Although growth in Africa registered a 2.9 percent in 1998, for
the first time in the 1990s, exceeding that of developing
countries as a whole, the growth of output barely kept pace with
that of population in the region.
</P>
<P>
The report said in 1998, growth accelerated in north Africa,
while the stagnation in South Africa had spillover effects on
neighboring Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
In West Africa, growth slowed in Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire and
Ghana, while in East Africa the decline in growth spread over a
large number of countries.
</P>
<P>
Affected by subsequent deepening of the Asian crisis and
repercussion on trade and commodity markets, the report said, of
47 African countries, 39 are dependent on a mere two primary
commodities for over 50 percent of exporting earnings and the
substantial drop in commodity prices in 1998 encompassed the
entire range of African exports.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that there was a large trade deficit for the
region as a whole which, together with an increasing and
substantial deficit in services, resulted in a surge in the
current account deficit from 4.9 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 to
over 16.5 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, it said that it is estimated that net foreign direct
investment into Africa fell by 20 percent in 1998. Of the foreign
direct investment into the developing countries, only four percent
flowed to Sub-Saharan Africa for the 1990-1998 period compared
with nine percent for the 1983-1989 period.
</P>
<P>
Debt continued to be a serious problem in Africa, the report
said, adding that by the end of 1998, total African debt as a
percentage of gross domestic product had reached 65.5 percent,
marginally higher than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report said Africa's trade remained sluggish in 1998 with
exports falling by 1.3 percent in volume and imports remaining
unchanged after the rise of nine percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
But it pointed out that owing to the recent decline in
commodity prices the region's export earings fell sharply by 16
percent, as against an increase of two percent in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Most hit by the decline of commodity prices are oil-exporting
African countries, losing 13 percent of GDP on account of the
terms of trade, the report said
</P>
<P>
Falling commodity prices also affected the more diversified
economies in the region, including Kenya, Mauritius and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> France Stresses Security Council's Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- France said Monday
that the fundamental role of the international community is for
the U.N. Security Council to resolve crisis situations.
</P>
<P>
The "civilizing goal" of the United Nations is "uniting peoples
to work together for peace and development", Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin told the 54th Session of the U.N. General Assembly which
opened general debate Monday.
</P>
<P>
The goal is achieved through the peaceful settlement of
conflicts between states and in this misson "the role of the
Security Council is more than ever primordial", he said.
</P>
<P>
The Council derives this preeminence from the (U.N.) Charter
and "France will recall this fundamental rule as often as
necessary", the Prime Minister said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Africa, Jospin said the extent of the tragedies on
the continent requires the international community to take more
resolute action.
</P>
<P>
He urged U.N. member states to meet their financial obligations
to the world body to prevent U.N. financial difficulties from
becoming a pretext for inaction.
</P>
<P>
Jospin reaffirmed France' commitment to alleviating the debt
burden of the poorest countries and urged other industrialized
nations to establish appropriate cooperation with these countries.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Head of Closed Iranian Daily Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A court in Tehran opened on
Monday an investigation into charges leveled against Latif Safari,
managing director of liberal Neshat daily shut down two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The hearing at one branch of the public courts was attended by
members of the press jury.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the Law Enforcement Forces (LEF), reading
the complaint lodged by the LEF commander, said the charges were
filed based on "hostile articles published by the daily on July 18
and July 25 against the LEF command and personnel."
</P>
<P>
According to a statement by the public relations department of
the Tehran judiciary, the public court is to probe into 73 cases
of charges against Safari. But it did not give details.
</P>
<P>
Neshat had published a open letter from a opposition leader
that advised supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to distance
himself from hardliners.
</P>
<P>
The Persian-language newspaper also carried article early this
month by a reader urging for the abolition of capital punishment,
calling it "the most prominent type of governmental violence."
</P>
<P>
Days after the publishing of the article, Khamenei said that
anyone who questioned the Islamic rationale for the death penalty
deserved to be executed. He also accused some newspaper of abusing
their freedom.
</P>
<P>
Neshat was ordered to stop publishing on September 5. The ban
will hold until the trial of the managing director ends.
</P>
<P>
Neshat's closure is the latest in a series of newspaper
bannings related to a power struggle between conservatives who
dominate the judiciary and the parliament and reformists
represented by President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Hardliners have closed down several pro-Khatami newspapers like
Neshat this year.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Presses for Change of Global </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa Monday challenged the international community to
rethink the mechanisms and policies that underpin the functioning
of the global economy, so as to create a conducive environment for
rapid economic development of the least developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The president, who was addressing the 54th United Nations
General Assembly in New York, said that the processes of
liberalization and globalization of the world economy have
profound implications for least developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The processes affected the least developed countries' position
in the world economy, their development prospects, the nature of
their economic policies, and their impact on economic sovereignty,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We need a system whose pillars are growth, stability and social
equity, and which should facilitate the integration of least
developed countries into the world economy in a beneficial way," a
report reaching here quoted Mkapa as saying.
</P>
<P>
The countries, he said, particularly those in Africa, remain
constrained by weak supply capabilities that when compounded by an
unfavorable international economic environment, limit their
ability to benefit from globalization.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa told the U.N. General Assembly that the last
few years before the new millenium does not give Africa much
comfort.
</P>
<P>
Citing examples, he said, from 1990 to 1996, African exports of
goods grew by two percent on average, compared to a world average
of seven percent, and 10 percent for Asia.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, while African exports of goods represented 5.9
percent of world exports in 1980, that share was down to only
three percent by 1990, and a minuscule 2.3 percent by 1996," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, African countries need more, not less,
financial and technical support in their development processes.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the long-term objective of least developed countries
is to improve production of quality goods and services that can
meet local needs and be exported.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries, Mkapa said, see trade as a dynamic force
for accelerating growth and development. However, he admitted that
developing countries are aware of its limitation in producing such
goods for the international market.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the issue of commodities should thus continue
to be central to the international development agenda.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the least developed countries in particular urge the
 international community to provide sources and technical
assistance to countries that depend on commodities to build the
capacity for vertical and horizontal diversification of
commodities.
</P>
<P>
!0Our capacity to add value to commodities is critical for our
meaningful participation in a globalizing world. But even then we
need greater market access abroad,!1 he noted.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, developed countries and funding
institutions should increase their support to the Common Fund for
Commodities, including fulfillment of their pledges. He also
appealed to the United Nations to reconsider the proposal for the
establishment of a special fund to promote commodity
diversification in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Seattle World Trade Organization
Ministerial Meeting would give further impetus to the
implementation of measures to help the least developed countries
integrate in the international trading system in a meaningful way.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon the donor community to expand financial and
technical assistance toward the implementation of integration
frameworks prepared by the least developed countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on debt burden, the president said the burden of debt
is one of the main obstacles to the achievement of economic and
social development objectives of Africa and other least developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said those countries devoting a high proportion, in some
cases exceeding 30 percent, of government revenue to debt service
payment, consequently risk social and political instability.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Africa Moves to Rein In Wave of Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent murder of Zimbabwean vice-consul Madzorera Meki in
Johannesburg in a hijacking again brings the seriousness of crimes
in the the country under spotlight.
</P>
<P>
Ami Mpungwe, dean of South Africa's diplomatic corps and high
commissioner for Tanzania, said the violent death marked a setback
for the security situation in South Africa, reeling under mounting
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Recent attacks on the foreign community include the murder of a
South Korean motor corporation head in a hijacking, a Canadian
diplomat who was robbed in Cape Town, a Belgian priest killed in
Northern Province, the gang rape of a UNICEF official in Pretoria,
and the rape of a Brazilian journalist visiting Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The rising crime rate has, to some extent, scared away
potential investors and tourists who could have contributed
greatly to the struggling economy in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government has warned its citizens they have to be
extra cautious when visiting Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and
Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's murder rate was nine times higher than the
international average. One in two women stood a chance of being
raped and one in three girls and one out of five boys would be
abused, the Citizen newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa is the second most dangerous country behind
Colombia and crime is costing us 8 million rand (1.33 million U.S.
dollars) a day or almost 3 billion rand (500 million dollars) a
year," said Mark Welman of South Africa's Anti-crime Center.
</P>
<P>
A look at the prisons in South Africa could help present a
better picture of the heavy burden the government is shouldering
in its fight against crimes.
</P>
<P>
A total of more than 1.7 million sentenced and unsentenced
prisoners were held in South Africa's prisons last year, compared
with about 1.3 million in 1995, according to Correctional Services
Minister Ben Skosana.
</P>
<P>
Confronting the grave challenge, the government is even more
determined to rein in the wave of crimes.
</P>
<P>
The approval of a new Firearms Control Bill by the cabinet
last week has raised hope that the spread of firearms in the
society and armed carnage would be curbed.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, schools, hospitals, places of worship, bars and
shebeens are likely to be declared "gun free zones", where only
on-duty police may carry firearms. Increased search and seizure
powers for the police and harsher sentences for gun offences are
among other policy recommendations to halt the country's growing
gun menace.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that about 500,000 illegal arms were in
circulation in the country. Of the registered firearms, about 70
percent of the addresses given in the Central Firearm Register
were false or out of date.
</P>
<P>
"We want to do two things: reduce the level of violent crime in
South Africa, and also to introduce a culture of responsible gun
ownership," Safety and Security Minister Steve Tshwete said.
</P>
<P>
To toughen anti-crime laws, Deputy President Jacob Zuma, acting
on behalf of Mbeki, has signed the Prevention of Organized Crime
Second Amendment Act into law, allowing seizure of criminal
assets.
</P>
<P>
The government is also considering enforcing the new Sexual
Offenses Bill which may imposed a sentence "not exceeding 999
years" for a much wider offence of rape.
</P>
<P>
To beef up the fight, the government recently launched the
elite crime- busting "Scorpions" unit to center on organized
crimes, justice and police corruption. The unit, the latest weapon
in the fight against crime, will operate along a
multi-disciplinary approach which would include intelligence,
investigation and prosecution. The unit will investigate selected
priority crimes like organized and violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
With all these measures, the local media expected South
Africa's crime rate to be reduced by about a third within the next
three years. As the fight against crimes has reached a turning
point, the government is even more committed to cracking the "hard
nut" of crimes.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Considers Opening Embassy in Libya: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is
considering opening an embassy in Libya, the National Assembly's
foreign affairs committee was told Monday, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"Whether you like it or not, (Libyan leader) Colonel (Muammar)
Gaddafi will have an impact on Africa," South Africa's ambassador
to the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Kingsley Mamabolo,
told the committee.
</P>
<P>
He was briefing them about the OAU's extraordinary summit in
the Libyan coastal town of Sirte earlier this month, called by
Gaddafi, to adopt his grand vision of a United States of Africa.
</P>
<P>
African leaders instead agreed on a compromise, adopting a
declaration which spoke about launching an African Union. Its
founding act would be adopted in 2001 at another extraordinary
summit.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Marco Boni as saying
that when Mandela announced the breakthrough in the Lockerbie
dispute in March, he had committed South Africa to opening an
embassy in Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a process of rationalization of our foreign
representation and we're looking at the option in that context,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Libya established diplomatic ties with South Africa shortly
after the 1994 general elections, but diplomatic matters in Libya
have been overseen by the South African mission in Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Mamabolo said South Africa could benefit economically from the
good relations with Libya.
</P>
<P>
"Gaddafi needs to be taken seriously. There's a lot we can
gain. He sees us as a strategic partner and we must exploit this."
</P>
<P>
With the Lockerbie dispute now resolved -- thanks to the
mediation efforts of, among others, former President Nelson
Mandela -- Libya has since emerged from eight years of
international isolation.
</P>
<P>
Committee chairman, Ebrahim Ebrahim, agreed and said: "There is
a need for an embassy there."

<P>
Luanda, September 20 (xinhua) -- A deputy of the Angolan
National Assembly (ANA), renegade to the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), was found to be shot dead in the
Samba District of Luanda, National Police announced here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, Joao Ngolongombe Jacob, legislator of
the Renovated Commission of UNITA, was shot in the head with a

The police said that the investigation of the incident is under
way and for this moment, the motive and the culprit of the crime
are not clear.
</P>
<P>
Jacob, native of the Province of Cunene, a southernmost
province of Angola, renegaded from the rebel UNITA led by Jonas

<HEADLINE> WIPO Opens 34th Series of Meetings in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO) opened the meetings of its General
Assemblies here Monday by electing Marino Porzio of Chile as
Chairperson.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the assemblies scheduled from September 20 to
29, Porzio said the work of WIPO has acquired increasing
importance in light of the revolution taking place in the area of
information technologies.
</P>
<P>
"Intellectual property as it has developed, is now more than
ever facing a revolution that is based on information technology
development," said Porzio. "The changes that have been produced
because of this new technology are real and tangible and this has
given rise to new activities mainly in the area of services which
will have a decisive influence in many of the traditional
institutions of intellectual property."
</P>
<P>
Porzio, a former WIPO deputy director-general in the 1980s,
said a key feature of the new digital era is the speed of change
of technologies, adding that this poses a challenge to WIPO in its
work to promote the protection of intellectual property through
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that globalization has given rise to the
internationalization in the production of goods, services and
trade and has demonstrated the interdependence of markets.
</P>
<P>
WIPO is at present in a "pivotal position" to assist countries
in meeting the challenges posed by the digital era in relation to
intellectual property, Porzio said, stressing that the solutions
must be "modern, economic and appropriate in order to resolve
development issues".

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Take Final Decision on Imported Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Scandal
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will soon take its
final decision on the scandal of importing from South African food
 unfit for human consumption.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by State Minister for Defense Steven Kavuma
when he appeared before the parliamentary committee on defense
and internal affairs over the defense budget here Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Our ministry is still studying various verification reports
about the imported food scheduled for the troops and is going to
make its final decision soon," the minister told the 22-member
committee.
</P>
<P>
"I have all the reports ready now. The last one was done by an
expert with Makerere University. We have to scrutinize all the
reports before issuing our demands," he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the committee expressed its concern about the
possibility of the varsity expert's being compromised by the
supplier of the food while preparing the report.
</P>
<P>
Members of Parliament complained that the imported food has
too short a shelf life and suspected corruption of the buyers in
the process of the purchase.
</P>
<P>
In late August, a report prepared by six professionals from
both the government and academies after their inspecting the food
ration said that it was unfit for human consumption.  The
report indicated that a government-contracted Pre-shipment
Inspection Firm had inspected the ration before shipment from
Durban and okayed it.
</P>
<P>
Ferried in 42 containers, each 20 feet high, the food was
shipped from Durban on June 9 aboard an MV Pangani 9023 vessel.
The consignment, worth 1. 5 million U.S. dollars, comprises
biscuits, tinned beans and chicken. The food, mainly meant for
troops in war zones, was supplied by Kramer Trade and Technology
of South Africa.

<HEADLINE> WHO Slams African Governments on Health Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- World Health Organization
(WHO) Monday criticised the governments of African countries for
failing to attach importance to health research.
</P>
<P>
"Research has not been given the priority it deserves in the
region ... it has been given lip service," WHO regional director
for Africa Abraham Samba said at the African conference on health
research for development in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Major challenges facing research in Africa included finding
ways of increasing awareness about the importance of research and
the motivation of available resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
The WHO official stressed that it is also critical to
strengthen national institutional capacity and set appropriate
coordination mechanism, arrest the current trend of donor-driven
research and mobilize country and regional resources for research.
</P>
<P>
Samba said a feeling of rivalry and competition rather than
cooperation between policy makers and researchers also hampered
the growth of research on the continent.
</P>
<P>
He noted that African countries had failed to utilize research
findings for the benefit of most people at the excuse of financial
hurdles.
</P>
<P>
"Countries, no matter how poor they are, should use research to
promote knowledge and strengthen health action," he said.
</P>
<P>
He challenged participants to focus research efforts on the
health problems of the large majority of the population.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 delegates from various countries are attending
the four- day conference which is to discuss ways of improving
research in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Annan Lists Pressing Challenges for U.N. Mission in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday said that it is high time to cement the
authority of the U.N. mission in Kosovo, to provide temporary
winterized accommodation for the almost 350,000 people in need,
and the ensure the future stability of Kosovo, a Yugoslav
province.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement in his report to the Security Council
on the latest situation in Kosovo, which is published here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Interim Administration Mission (UNMIK) "made
important strides over the past 12 months," and "today's Kosovo
bears a little resemblance to that of mid-June 1999; most refugees
are home, the informal economy is thriving and efforts are under
way to restore law and order as well as security throughout the
province," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, Kosovo's future is not yet secured and there remains
a threat that these gains might be reversed if UNMIK is unable to
address three pressing challenges in the coming weeks and months,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"First, is the establishment and cementing of the rule of law
and the authority of UNMIK," he said. "This is essential for the
retention of a multi-ethnic Kosovo and for the creation of
conditions necessary for those who have left Kosovo to return."
</P>
<P>
"The international community must make it clear to extremists
that it cannot and will not tolerate ethnically motivated murders
and violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the withdrawal of the Yugoslav troops from Kosovo, and
the arrival of the NATO-led international peacekeepers, the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) staged a comeback in the Serbian
province before the non-Albanian residents suffered from
persecutions.
</P>
<P>
"The international community must also redouble its own efforts
to make far greater efforts to restrain and redirect the emotions
unleashed by the conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The second pressing priority is the provision of temporary
winterized accommodation for the almost 350,000 people in need,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Most at risk are those who lie in rural or high altitude
communities," he said. "Most of the damaged and destroyed houses
cannot be permanently repaired before winter, not is it within the
scope or capacity of humanitarian agencies to do this work."
</P>
<P>
As winter approaches, Kosovo has only two thirds of its winter
electricity requirement and, despite repairs, the electricity
remains fragile in the wake of the 79-day wanton air strikes by
NATO, which ended on June 10.
</P>
<P>
"The emergency rehabilitation program is thus aimed at ensuring
that all residents have at least temporary housing until next
spring," he said. "Attention must also be directed towards the
rehabilitation of public utilities."
</P>
<P>
"Third, to ensure the future stability of Kosovo," he said, "It
is important that the international community ensure the
demobilization of the KLA and other armed elements."
</P>
<P>
Sufficient funds and resources should be provided to enable
former combatants to find opportunities for employment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan also called upon the international community
to render further assistance to UNMIK to ensure progress in
carrying out its mandate under the U.N. resolution 1244, which was
adopted on June 10.
</P>
<P>
However, Yugoslavia has launched several protests with the
president of the Security Council against UNMIK's action to set up
a customs office in Kosovo and legalize the use of foreign
currencies in the region, saying this action is violating the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Balkan country and
the resolution 1244 itself.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian President in Kuwait For State Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- President of Bosnian and
Herzegvina Alija Izetbegovic arrived here on Monday for a
three-day state visit aimed at boosting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic will hold talks with Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad
Al-Sabah on means of strengthening bilateral relations and issues
of mutual concern, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was among the first countries that recognized Bosnia
and Herzegvina as an independent state. The two countries
established diplomatic relations in January 1993.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic last visited Kuwait in 1993, when he held talks
with Jaber on the latest developments in Bosnia and means of
solving the Bosnian-Serb conflict.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 and 1996, two Bosnian prime ministers visited the Gulf
state for talks on ways of cementing bilateral links and other
issues of common interests.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Bosnia are also bound by several cooperative
agreements. The two sides signed in 1997 an agreement to
encourage and protect investment of both countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development extended 6
million Kuwait dinars (19.8 million U.S. dollars) in loans as
contribution to the Bosnia Bank capital to rebuild and develop the
country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe still Safe Tourist Destination: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 20 (Xinhua) (C The Zimbabwe Council of
Tourism (ZCT) on Monday assured prospective travelers to Zimbabwe
that the country was still a safe tourist destination contrary to
recent media reports that there was an increase of tourist
muggings.
</P>
<P>
This follows reports in the press on Sunday saying the British
Foreign and Commonwealth Office had advised prospective travelers
to Zimbabwe that pocket-picking and muggings were on the increase
and prevalent in the country's city centers, especially in Harare.
</P>
<P>
ZCT chief executive officer Elias Nyakunu said in a statement
that although there had been reports of tourists being mugged in
the past this was not an indication of a worsening situation.
</P>
<P>
"Like in any other country, Zimbabwe has its own fair share of
muggings, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office must
provide statistics to prove that there is an increase in
pocketpicking and muggings, particularly of tourists in the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Superintendent Wayne Bzudzijena said such
crimes were not in the increase in the main city centres of
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"We have been conducting foot patrols and this has lead to the
decrease in the number of tourists and general public being
mugged," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is a country with rich tourism resources including the
Victoria Falls. Tourism industry is the fast developing sector
in the country. Last year, about two million foreign travelers
visited the country.

<HEADLINE> Athens, Istanbul Sign Cooperation Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece's capital of Athens
signed Monday with the northwestern Turkish city of Istanbul a
protocol of cooperation on issues of culture, tourism and
maintenance of historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was signed here by Athens Mayor Dimitris
Avramopoulos and his Istanbul counterpart, Ali Mufit Gurtuna, who
is on a visit to Athens in response to an earlier one by
Avramopoulos.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Avramopoulos said that
obsessions and prejudice of the past must be overcome and a bridge
of friendship and cooperation must be built on the rubble of the
collapsed buildings caused by recent earthquakes in Athens and
Izmir.
</P>
<P>
Gurtuna, who arrived here Sunday, was also received Monday by
Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos.
</P>
<P>
The Istanbul mayor reportedly conveyed the wishes of Turkish
President Suleiman Demirel for the restoration of the damages
caused to Athens by the September 7 earthquake, which is estimated
to cost Greece 200 billion drachmas (about 645 million U.S.
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Angola Gets $40 Million Aid from World Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luanda, September 20 (xinhua) -- World Food Program (WFP)
signed here on Monday a contract with the Angolan government,
providing the war-torn country with 40 million U.S. dollars for
helping the displaced people in hunger.
</P>
<P>
The contract foresees an acquisition of 57,000 tons of food by
WFP for the benefit of 800,000 Angolans in need by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Director-executive of WFP Namanga Ngongi, who
co-signed the contract with Angola's minister of Assistance and
Social reintegration Albino Malungo, said that the aid is so
"important", for it will help attenuate the food crisis and the
scarcity of living necessities.
</P>
<P>
Ngongi, who made recently an appraisal on the humanitarian
situation of the displaced people in Angola, said that his
organization will continue to provide the country with assistance
in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Minister of assistance Malungo, who considers the gesture of
WFP as " laudable", said that it "will permit to attenuate the
poverty, reduce the mal-nutrition and assure a sustained
integration for those people in need, particularly in the
agricultural field."
</P>
<P>
But the minister also pointed out that except the 800,000
people who will benefit from the contract, there still exist three
million more displaced poor people who will need the assistance
for the future.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued in August by the concerned
organization of the United Nations, the number of the displaced
people in Angola by the end of July has reached two million, while
the country's total population is about 12 million.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Terms Klestil's Visit "Turning Point" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami stressed Monday that Austrian President Thomas Klestil's
ongoing visit to Iran marks a turning point in relations between
the European Union and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Khatami was addressing a joint press conference with Klestil,
who arrived here earlier in the day on a two-day visit. Klestil is
the first EU head of state to visit Iran since the Islamic
Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, both Khatami and Klestil expressed
hope that the visit would lead to further expansion of cooperation
between Tehran and Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Heading a big delegation consisting of 80 business
representatives, Klestil said that economic cooperation will be
the focal point of his talks with Iranian officials and the visit
also indicates Austria's interest in investment and cooperation in
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
There are about 20 Austrian firms in Iran, which earn about 230
million U.S. dollars each year from exporting Austrian products to
Iran. That is some 10 times more than Iran's exports to Austria,
which are mostly carpets and fruit.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Khatami expressed confidence that Klestil's visit
will be positive point and effective in further expanding
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed "I am not only meeting president of the vibrant and
jubilant country of Austria, but also welcoming him as
representative of an age-old civilization."
</P>
<P>
Austria should be considered as one of the spiritual capitals
of the West for its brilliant record, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran initiated Islam-Christianity dialog years ago with
Austrian friends, said the president, adding that even he himself
had attended one of the conferences before his election as
president in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The visit of Klestil, said Khatami, indicates that "we are
going to enter the 21st century at a time when we have reached
agreement to hold talks with our friends on the basis of mutual
understanding and respect."
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials believe that they can have good cooperation
with Austria in all cultural, political, economic, industrial and
scientific fields and the visit would prepare the ground for
better cooperation between the two countries, Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that Austria has played a positive role in
helping improving relations between Iran and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Since assuming office, Khatami has made efforts to improve
relations with EU, which were marred by Iran's condemnation of
British writer Salmon Rushdie for his book The Satanic Verses.
</P>
<P>
He paid a landmark visit to Italy in March, which is considered
an important step in opening links with the 15-member bloc.

<HEADLINE> Annan: U.N. Should Adapt Itself to New World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan called here Monday for change in the
U.N. role, highlighting humanitarian intervention across borders,
a controversial issue being debated inside and outside the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the general debate of the 54th U.N. General
Assembly, the U.N. chief said: "As we seek new ways to combat the
ancient enemies of war and poverty, we will succeed only if we all
adapt our organization to a world with new actors, new
responsibilities, and new possibilities for peace and progress."
</P>
<P>
He believes that state sovereignty is being redefined in the
process of globalization and international cooperation, while
individual sovereignty had been enhanced by a renewed
consciousness of the right of every individual to control his or
her own destiny.
</P>
<P>
He said that the core challenge to the Security Council and the
U.N. as a whole in the next century was to forge unity behind the
principle that massive and systematic violations of human rights
should not be allowed to stand.
</P>
<P>
Annan admitted that the Kosovo conflict and its outcome has
divided the international community on how to intervene in
humanitarian crisis. Some member states believe that military
intervention could be carried out without seeking authorization
from the Security Council, while the others assert that state
sovereignty must be respected and permission from the Security
Council sought.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief defended the U.N. Charter, but stressed that its
principles must apply to a new era where the traditional notions
of sovereignty could no longer meet peoples' aspirations.
</P>
<P>
Avoiding jump into conclusion, he identified four aspects of
intervention including broadening the definitions of intervention
and national interest, uniting the Security Council in defense of
common humanity and making commitment to peace as strong as to
war.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the U.N. chief has detailed what were in
his mind as the world is at the threshold of a new century.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that his speech might fuel the controversies over
state sovereignty and humanitarian intervention, which has divided
the Security Council on the Kosovo crisis and conflicts in other
places.
</P>
<P>
Brazil' Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia complained in his
speech Monday morning that the United Nations had failed to take
coordinated actions and mobilize necessary resources to deal with
crisis. Its weakness had excluded the U.N. from the solution to
the Kosovo crisis earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Some countries, especially the developing ones, might disagree
with the secretary-general on human rights and humanitarian
intervention. They might prefer to give top priority to promoting
economic and social development, and maintaining world peace and
security under the principles of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian intervention without respect for state sovereignty
might change the international political structure carefully
established after the World War II, an expert on the U.N. affairs
said.
</P>
<P>
The controversy might further be debated in the general debate
which began Monday morning and is expected to last for two weeks.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Woman Allowed to Challenge Britain on IRA Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A Protestant woman from
Northern Ireland whose parents were killed by an IRA bomb was
granted on Monday to leave to apply for a judicial review of
Britain's decision that the IRA's ceasefire is intact.
</P>
<P>
The case is being brought by Michelle Williamson, whose parents
were among nine people killed in a bomb attack by the Irish
Republican Army on the Shankill Road in Belfast six years ago.
</P>
<P>
British Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said on August 26
that despite evidence of renewed guerrilla activity, the ceasefire
had not broken down.
</P>
<P>
She added that she would not halt the release of hundreds of
IRA guerrillas jailed during their 30-year war against British
rule.
</P>
<P>
Williamson said the IRA man convicted of murdering her parents,
Sean Kelly, had been given nine life sentences -- nine of the
victims of his bomb attack were Protestants, one was an IRA bomber
-- but had applied for early release under the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
"He will serve only seven years in prison for nine murders --
less than one year for each life that he has destroyed," she said.
</P>
<P>
Judge Brian Kerr gave Williamson permission to have Mowlam's
decision reviewed in the courts, but said his ruling was not a
judgment on the case. He said Williamson had satisfied the test
that she had an "arguable case".
</P>
<P>
"It follows that my decision to grant leave (for a judicial
review) which I have reached is not in any sense to be taken as a
forecast of the ultimate outcome of the case," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, who accompanied
Williamson into court, said: "This is merely the first step of
what will be a fairly lengthy and complex process."
</P>
<P>
In a brief comment, the government said it would respond
vigorously to any challenge.
</P>
<P>
A Northern Ireland Office spokesman said it believed Mowlam had
acted properly according to the law, in making her determination.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- South African
President Thabo Mbeki on Monday called for a greater commitment
among the nations to the resolution of national and international
conflicts by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 54th Session of the U.N. General Assembly, he
said the United Nations has a "solemn and supreme responsibility"
to work for the prevention of conflicts according to the U.N.
Charter.
</P>
<P>
Before touching upon a series of international issues, Mbeki
emphasized his objection to the notion of spheres of influence.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no need on the part of any country to seek to
establish spheres of influence as a supposed necessary condition
for the advancement of its national interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said no country should be required to restrict the exercise
of its right simply because of dictation by "some other more
powerful country".

<HEADLINE> Namibia Urges Increased Foreign Direct Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Increased Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI) was very important to complement the
political and economic reforms and sustained economic growth in
Africa, Namibia said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 54th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Namibia's President Sam Nujoma said
Africa carries 10 percent of the world's population, but produces
only 1 percent of the world's Gross Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
Sam Nujoma said " Foreign Direct Investment to Sub-Saharan
Africa is estimated at meagre 3 percent of all total FDI. With
most of the Least developed countries in Africa, this vast, rich
but underdeveloped continent continues to challenge the
Organization."
</P>
<P>
"Poverty and disease have all become much talked about to
depict the situation in many parts of Africa. Armed conflicts in
various parts of Africa continues to strip our continent of its
human and natural resources. this overshadows the overall
achievements, which Africa continues to make," the President said.
</P>
<P>
"Africa today is democratizing and undertaking economic reforms
to maximise social and economic prosperity for its people. and
indeed, some significant economic growth have been recorded in a
large number of countries," said the President.
</P>
<P>
"However, political and economic reforms in themselves will not
deliver sustained economic growth. Increased FDI is very important
to complement these reforms and to sustained the current growth
rate," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Foregin Direct Investment should not replace official
development aid, and foreign aid would be a necessary complement
to Africa's own efforts for recovery and development of its
people, stressed the President.

<HEADLINE> Iran's IRGC Air Force to Manufacture Gunship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tehran, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Air Force Commander of the
Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Mohammad Bagher said Monday
that the air force can manufacture helicopter-gunship equipped
with advanced weapons by the end of 2003.
</P>
<P>
The brigadier general said the air force is also engaged in
manufacturing a 15-seat helicopter that is expected to conduct its
test-flight by the end of 2004, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the air force have manufactured a helicopter named
Shahed x5, which has successfully carried out its test flights, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The general said that the program to produce advanced
helicopter is part of the five-year economic, social and cultural
development plan from 2000 to 2005.
</P>
<P>
Bagher said by end of the five-year plan, the air force can
produce some 20 Shahed x5 helicopters, which are designed to meet
Iran's climate and can fly at an altitude of 17,500 feet (5,334
meters) above the sea level.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been concentrating on developing its own military
hardware, drawing lessons from the arms embargo imposed by the
U.S. and its Western allies during the Iran-Iraq war in 1980-88.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Hopes to See U.N. Playing Meaningful Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Brazil Monday voiced
hope to see the United Nations can act up to the challenges and
give "meaning answers" to the crisis and humanitarian tragedy in
the world at large.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe
Lampreia was speaking to a general debate of the 54th General
Assembly session, which began on Monday morning at the United
Nations headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever an unfolding crisis and its humanitarian tragedy
breaks through international indifference and becomes newsworthy,
it is to the United Nations that the public opinion of our
countries looks for meaningful answers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, however, the international community only feels
compelled to act in a coordinated fashion, mobilizing the
necessary resources and political will, when long-festering
problems threaten to get out of hand, making the satisfactory
solution all the more difficult," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The upshot is a sense of frustration and impatience towards
the United Nations," he said. "Either because the necessary
initiatives were in the end adopted outside the U.N. framework, as
was the case in Kosovo," the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
"Or since the measures agreed were not up to the concrete
needs, as we have seen in East Timor," he said. "Or even because
the United Nations finds itself once again confronted, as in
Angola, with well-known conflicts of catastrophic proportions that
the international community ahs failed to address in a timely
manner."
</P>
<P>
"The plight of Angola and East Timor offer two glaring examples
of what amounts to a clear pattern of one-sided and unequal
attention," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our societies await, again, with increasing impatience, that
multilateral organizations, and in particular the United Nations,
show themselves up to the challenge of playing a meaningful, in
fact crucial, role in establishing an international order attuned
to the shared aspirations and values of humankind as a whole," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The road ahead calls for renewal and change," he said. "If the
governments of the world desire a strong and effective United
Nations, they must not only change how they think and act with
respect to this Organization, but equally they must think and act
so as to bring about change in the Organization," he added. "This
is what is at stake and this is the challenge before us."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Brazilian foreign minister also touched upon the
Latin American economy, organized crime and drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger: China No Threat to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger said China will not pose any strategic
threat against the United States.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger made the remark in a speech at a recent conference on
U.S.-China relations on the Eve of the 21st Century sponsored by
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
</P>
<P>
He said it is inevitable that as China develops, it will
acquire a military capability, but "it is important to gain some
sense of perspective" that China will not threaten the United
States for at least 20 years.
</P>
<P>
He said he does not think China can mount a first strategic
attack against the U.S. threatening the country's retaliatory
capability.
</P>
<P>
"It's forces will be minimum, compared to what the Soviet Union
had," he said. "And almost certainly, we would have developed a
missile defense system by then which will reduce that capacity
even more."
</P>
<P>
Refuting the cold-war mentality of some U.S. politicians,
Kissinger said U.S.-China relations should not be characterized
by cold war.
</P>
<P>
No doubt human rights has become a fundamental aspect of
American foreign policy, but it does not necessarily mean that the
overthrow of the Communist system must be a principal goal of its
China policy, said Kissinger, who played an important role in
normalizing relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger said there is a "huge difference" between the Chinese
Communist Party and the Soviet Communist Party as the latter
claimed universal applicability and used military force and its
system to undermine the American position around the world.
</P>
<P>
"But none of these is the function of the Chinese Communist
Party," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Taiwan, Kissinger said the U.S. and China
could have extensive conversation on it.
</P>
<P>
Since 1971 all the U.S. governments faced the Taiwan issue and
recognized that there is only one China in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger, who accompanied President Richard Nixon in his
historic visit to China in 1972, described it as an "extremely
great achievement and credit to the wisdom" of both sides to
manage the Taiwan issue for 30 years in a way "compatible with the
dignity and self-respect of both sides".
</P>
<P>
Calling on Taiwan to show restraint, Kissinger said he warned
against "any attempt to challenge the framework" which has lasted
for three decades.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger said he does not think the United States would "need
any burden and run any risk in the defense of freedom anywhere".

<HEADLINE> Electronic Cheque Clearing Starts in Zambian Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The electronic cheque clearing
system for all commercial banks registered in Zambia started
operating Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new system operating at clearing houses in Lusaka and some
other cities in the country would replace the manual clearing
process which would be phased out in the next six months, Project
manager James Kalengo said earlier in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The new system, which operates through the Zambia Electronic
Clearing House jointly owned by the Bank of Zambia and the Bankers
Association of Zambia, would expedite the clearing of cheques
which currently takes four days.
</P>
<P>
Plans are under way to introduce the system in all banks in
Zambia after the complete phasing-out of the old method.
</P>
<P>
In the new system, all commercial banks would have special
cheques that had magnetic ink character recognition encoded
documents.
</P>
<P>
Specifications were developed on the basis of some standards
set by representatives of the banking sector and approved by the
Bankers Association of Zambia last November.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Minister Demands Increase of Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Budget
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's State Minister for
Defense Steven Kavuma has demanded a substantial increase of the
defense budget to meet more challenging demands the army is
facing.
</P>
<P>
The demand was contained in a report he submit to the
parliamentary committee of defense and internal affairs here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the report entitled Addendum to The Police Statement of
the Defense Ministry, the minister asked for an increase of the
defense budget from 166 billion shillings (120 million U.S.
dollars) to 199 billion shillings (140 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said in the report:"At the time of the Finance Minister had
not yet released information on the allocation to my ministry of
funds to settle domestic arrears, I have pointed out in my policy
statement that my ministry had incurred a domestic debt of 20
billion shillings (14 million dollars) in the course of year
1998/1999."
</P>
<P>
"Now that I have full information on the provision to my
ministry of settling the domestic debt totalling 22 billion
shillings (15.4 million dollars) and an additional provision of
promissory notes totalling 930 million shillings (664,000
dollars) on the capital development budget," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the army is facing more and more challenges which
need to be dealt with, he told the parliamentary committee,
citing that the increase of budget would be absolutely necessary
for the country's security and other purposes.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's defense budget has been a sensitive topic in the
Parliament because many donors have threatened to dwindle their
donations to Kampala if the government hikes the defense
expenditures by sacrificing some priority development programs.
</P>
<P>
The country is heavily dependent on foreign donations,
especially those from multinational institutions. One third of
the government's expenditure comes from donors' money. Donors
have criticized the country's military involvement in the armed
conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and have
demanded full accountability of their fund.

<HEADLINE> Britain May Grow Commercial GM Crops Before Trials End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain may grow controversial
genetically modified crops before a three-year trial period is
complete, according to local reports on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"If the trials for a particular crop were satisfactorily
concluded...there would be no point in making that wait till the
end of the trials," Cabinet Minister Jack Cunningham told BBC
Radio.
</P>
<P>
"If we were satisfied that one crop had cleared all the tests
satisfactorily and had been given a clean bill of environmental
health, I can't think of any logical reason why that should be
held up," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Environmental activists criticised Cunningham's
comments, saying that the government was using the tests as a
cover to press ahead with GM crops despite growing public
hostility.
</P>
<P>
"This is the clearest indication that these trials are a
yellowing, shrivelled fig leaf...to cover the government's passion
for genetically modified foods," a spokesman for Greenpeace said.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said prejudging

<HEADLINE> France Hails WTO Condemnation of U.S. Tax Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- France hailed on Monday the
condemnation by the World Trade Organization (WTO) of the tax
policy of the United States government on the country's export
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Finance and Economy Dominique Strauss-Kahn and
the State Secretary of Exterior Trade Francois Huwart described
the WTO decision as ``a remarkable success'' of the European Union
(EU), which sued the United States in the case.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers ``hope that the United States makes itself
very rapidly conform to the decision by not authorizing its
enterprises to benefit from tax cuttings,'' they said in a
communique.
</P>
<P>
In a confidential report submitted to the United States and the
EU, the world trade organization said that EU is right to consider
the U.S. tax policy on enterprises, as is reflected by the Foreign
Sales Corporation Act (FSCA), as disloyal to WTO rules on
competition.
</P>
<P>
It asked the United States to scrap FSCA by October 2000,
because it provides U.S. enterprises engaged in export with
competition advantages which are equivalent to subsidies.

</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Uganda, the
country's central bank, has intervened the foreign exchange
market by injecting more fund into the market to stabilize the
falling shilling.
</P>
<P>
This time the central bank has injected five million U.S.
dollars, bringing the bank's intervention fund in the foreign
exchange market to 20 million dollars since the beginning of
September, a press release from the bank's headquarters said
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The central bank reiterated its continued presence in the
forex market and readiness to take appropriate actions as and
when deemed necessary, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan shilling has been in a downward trend these days
reportedly due to the severe drought in the western part of the
country and off- season of coffee exports.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has announced that its economic growth
rate has shot up to 7.8 percent in the past financial year ending
June, the general public is still not so optimistic as the
government.
</P>
<P>
As the country's involvement in the armed conflict in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and its recent clashes hit
headlines recently, people begin to blame the government for
spending the bulk of its hard-earned foreign exchange on the war.
</P>
<P>
The forex market here is rather volatile, depending heavily on
the export of coffee which accounts for 60 percent of its foreign
exchange income.

<HEADLINE> WHO Plans to Contain Spread Of AIDS in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) said on Monday it is putting in place measures to intensify
efforts to prevent and control the spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa.
</P>
<P>
WHO regional director for Africa Ebrahim Samba said in a
statement the organization was planning a frontal attack on
opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, diarrhoetic
diseases and mouth infections known to afflict especially people
living with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"Drugs certainly do exist to fight these opportunistic
infections which take advantage of the weakened immune systems of
HIV positive people and we plan to deploy these drugs to the
fullest," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that WHO would also increase assistance to member
states in the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STD)
such as gonorrhea and syphilis.
</P>
<P>
He said WHO would work with governments in instituting quality
control to assure the safety of blood used in hospitals, as there
were possibilities of transmitting the HIV/AIDS virus through
blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
He said the organization continued to encourage the use of
condoms and ensure their wide availability.
</P>
<P>
"In addition WHO will advocate collaboration with partners in
improving access of people in the region living with AIDS to such
antiretroviral drugs as nevirapine,!1 he said.
</P>
<P>
Nevirapine slows the reproduction of the HIV virus that causes
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Samba hailed the decision by ten African nations to declare
HIV/AIDS a national disaster at the continent major conference on
AIDS which just ended in Lusaka, Zambia.

Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and the prospects for renewed
talks in other bilateral tracks.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Chief said Roed-Larsen would have the task of making
"appropriate preparations within the United Nations for enhancing
U.N. development assistance in support of the peace process."

Secretary-General in discussions with the parties and the
international community "in all matters related to continuing
United Nations support to the peace process," said Annan.
</P>
<P>
Roed-Larsen would take up his new post on October 1, 1999,

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief: Resumption of China's WTO Talks With US, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The recent resumption of
bilateral talks between China and the United States and between
China and the European Union (EU) on China's accession to the the
World Trade Organization (WTO) is encouraging, said WTO
Director-General Mike Moore here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Those talks were forced to a standstill after the US-led NATO
attacked the Chinese embassy in Belgrade last May. At the repeated
requests of the United States, the talks were resumed in
mid-September.
</P>
<P>
"I find it very encouraging and almost inspiring," Moore told
reporters at a press briefing at the WTO headquarters. "It would
be a splendid day when China sits at the table (at the third
ministerial conference in Seattle late this year) as it should do.
People in this building are enthusiastic."
</P>
<P>
He said that the secretariate under his leadership would make
every effort to speed up the process necessary for China's
accession when WTO members reach a general agreement.
</P>
<P>
At the same briefing, Senior Vice President and Chief Economist
of the World Bank Joseph E. Stiglitz said that China should
obviously be included in the multilateral system if WTO wants to
be an organization that embraces all countries.

<HEADLINE> EC to Release $34 million Aid to Zimbabwe Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 20 (Xinhua) - The European Commission (EC)
said on Monday it welcomed the stand-by agreement recently agreed
between Zimbabwe and the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
adding it is ready to release 34 million U.S. dollars next year
for various projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
EC representative in Zimbabwe Asger Pilegaard told reporters in
Harare that the move represented an important boost to market
confidence and the first step for mobilization of further
assistance by other donors to support the Zimbabwe's economic
reform program.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement gave the EC an opportunity to remove
conditions for its aid programs.
</P>
<P>
The objectives in the stand-by program included reducing the
budget deficit to more sustainable levels, curtailing excessive
monetary growth and accelerating the privatization process which
were necessary conditions for lower inflation, increased
investment, higher growth and more employment.
</P>
<P>
Pilegaard said, "In parallel with the World Bank and other
donors, the European Commission is prepared to support the
implementation of this strategy."
</P>
<P>
"Consultations with the Zimbabwean government will start
immediately with a view to agree on a framework for assistance in
the process which will give particular attention to the social
sectors in order to protect the most vulnerable," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the EC was very pleased to see the clear statements
made by the government in respect of fulfilling the program
agreed by the IMF and said its determination could see the EC
releasing 34 million U.S. dollars next year for various projects
in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the EC also supported the country's land reform
program, adding that a number of activities worth about 5.2
million U.S. dollars would begin soon.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EC hailed the Zimbabwean government's
intention to give priority to land reform for poor people.
</P>
<P>
"The EC will increase assistance for those newly resettled
through small-scale projects to promote rural development, health
and education," he said.

<HEADLINE> Moore Calls for Better Market Access for Poor Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The poorest countries should
be given better market access if the millennium round of world
trade talks is to be a success, said Director-General of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) Mike Moore here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moore was speaking at the opening session of a WTO/World Bank
conference on developing countries' interests in a millennium
round of world trade talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that to give more and better quality technical support
for the poor countries is his priority as the WTO head.
</P>
<P>
In the third ministerial conference of the WTO to be held in
Seattle in a little over two months, Moore said, WTO members will
launch new negotiations and establish a WTO work program which
will help define the trade and development agenda for the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
"Today's conference can help enormously in clarifying many of
the issues for Seattle, issues which will be picked up as
negotiations get under way," Moore said.
</P>
<P>
While developed countries show their goodwill by making
concessions, he said, developing country markets are also markets
in the process of development, the markets of the future.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, the process of development is something in which all
countries, rich and poor, have a stake," he added.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference stems largely from a World Bank research
and capacity-building program "Preparing for the WTO 2000
Negotiations: Enhancing Developing Country Participation".
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Senior Vice-President and Chief Economist of the
World Bank Joseph Stiglitz is scheduled to deliver a keynote
speech on the principles for the next round of trade talks.

SATAFE DE BOGOTA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Colombian

Talks with the 15,000-strong FARC were launched in January, but

<HEADLINE> SADC Mulls Regional Defense Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from three
member states of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
Monday started talks in Pretoria on a regional defense pact.
</P>
<P>
Among the attenders are Swazi Foreign Minister Albert Shabangu,
South African Defense Minister Patrick Lekota and Zimbabwean
Defense Minister Moven Mahatchi, according to South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
"Eventually we must have a protocol that will govern our
reaction to situations that require intervention, peacekeeping or
peace enforcement," Shabangu told reporters after talks.
</P>
<P>
It was hoped that all SADC members would endorse such a
protocol, said Shabangu, who chairs the inter-state defense and
security committee (IDSC) of SADC.
</P>
<P>
The regional group summit decided in Maputo last month that its
 structure dealing with defense, security and political matters
should be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
The IDSC was given six months to report back to SADC heads of
state.
</P>
<P>
Monday's meeting was the beginning of a consultative process on
the matter, Shabangu said.
</P>
<P>
The liberation era in the region was over, and it was time to
consolidate political freedom with a view to economic development.
To achieve this, a collective approach to defense was required.
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult area, but one that we as a region must think
and talk about. We have conflicts and we need institutions and
structures to deal with them," Shabangu said.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't have those, the danger of disunity is already at
our front door. We have to have collective action, and we have to
have predictable action."
</P>
<P>
Shabangu said consultations with other SADC members would
continue in preparation for a conference next month of ministers
responsible for politics, defense and security.
</P>
<P>
It was too early to predict when the protocol would be ready.
</P>
<P>
"We hope there will be some progress, and that we will have
something substantial when we report back to the heads of state,"
Shabangu said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Backs U.N. Court on Rwandan Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President
Olusegun Obasanjo has pledged strong political and moral support
for the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
(ICTR), the court said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo made the pledge while receiving the Registrar of the
U.N. tribunal Agwu Okali last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The registrar was on a working visit to the west African
country to raise awareness of the work of ICTR and seek Nigeria's
support for the court given the country's leadership role in
international affairs and Africa in particular.
</P>
<P>
"I believe strongly in what the tribunal is doing," a press
release issued by ICTR quoted Obasanjo as saying.
</P>
<P>
"There must never again be a repeat of genocide anywhere in
Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
Okali briefed President Obasanjo on the work of ICTR, its
accomplishments, and the special importance of the tribunal's work
to African countries.
</P>
<P>
The court, based in Arusha in northern Tanzania, was set up by
the United Nations Security Council in November 1994 and charged
with bringing to justice those who planned and directed the
genocide in which more than half a million civilians were killed

<HEADLINE> Colombia Urges Coordinated Efforts in Drug Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Efforts must be
coordinated in addressing the problem of drug trafficking,
Colombia stressed here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the 54th session of the
United Nations General Assembly, Colombia's President Andres
Pastrana said immoral drug trafficking, which destroys lives,
feeds violence, promotes corruption and destroys ecosystem, must
be fought by all nations with all available means.
</P>
<P>
To defeat it demands a real alliance between the countries
consuming and producing illegal drugs, under the principle of
joint responsibility, reciprocity and fairness, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, increased efforts must be made to take away from
narcotic traffickers the money and properties obtained through the
illegal trade, and the flow of precursor chemicals indispensable
for the production of narcotics must be halted, he said.
</P>
<P>
The times of intervention are over, and there are times of
cooperation, the president added.

system Monday began its sweep across the nation with heavy rain,
flooding and possible landslides expected.
</P>
<P>
The storm, which already caused considerable damage in Spain at
the weekend, has caused only minor damage with high winds more a
problem than rain.
</P>
<P>
In the northern Italian city of Milan, and the region of
Lombardy in general, for example, trees have been blown down and
there are reports of roof tiling being blown away.

<P>
Rain, with local downpours, is expected to continue throughout
the day in the northwest and temperatures have already dropped
several degrees there.
</P>
<P>
Flooding was reported in the northwestern region of Liguria
Monday morning after a night of heavy rain and traffic in and
around the regional capital of Genoa was in a grid lock because of
the flooding of key underpasses.
</P>
<P>
The wind and falling trees were reported to have caused power
lines to come down throughout the region while high seas have
created problems in the small ports along the coasts of Liguria.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Set Up Gene Bank for Major Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to spend
2 billion baht (50 million U.S. dollars) to establish a gene bank
for major crops in the country, the Bangkok Post said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives is looking for a
site and drafting a construction plan, the newspaper quoted Deputy
Agriculture Minister Newin Chidchod as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bank will be completed in two years, the deputy minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry expects that the gene bank will assist
in safeguarding Thailand's claims to indigenous plants and
animals, and products made from them, under pending laws.
</P>
<P>
The laws are likely to be in place next month after winning
Senate approval, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has so far listed 20,000 varieties of local plants
as part of moves aimed at requiring foreign commercial users to
pay royalties.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also gives priority to research which would add
value to major export crops such as rice and rubber.
</P>
<P>
Research will also extend to crops that replace imports, such
as soybean, oil palm and maize.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's Agriculture Department this year has set aside
460 million baht (11.5 million dollars) for research out of its
budget of 3.2 billion baht (80 million dollars).

<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital reported
a 41 percent growth in its exports in August -- the first positive
monthly growth for Beijing in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the capital's customs show that the city exported
302 million U.S. dollars worth of products in August, up 41
percent from the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months, the city recorded a trade volume of
5.11 billion U.S. dollars, up 27 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Its export rose four percent in the first eight months to reach
1.89 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Municipal trade officials contributed the growth in exports to
the city's continued efforts in developing new markets, and
optimizing trade forms and export products mix.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the city's state-owned enterprises
have witnessed a positive export growth, but exports by overseas-
funded enterprises have continued to drop.

<P>
In the first eight months, Beijing's exports to Europe and the
North America increased by 6.7 and 12 percent, respectively.
Exports to Russia increased 1.4 fold, but those to southeast Asian

<HEADLINE> Murder of UNICEF Official in Somalia Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Somalia Aid Coordination
Body Tuesday strongly condemned the murder of Dr. Ayub Sheik
Yeron, a medical doctor of the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF), in southern Somalia last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ayub, UNICEF's highest health and nutrition official in
southern Somalia, was shot with five others travelling in a U.N.
leased vehicle on the Mogadishu-Jowhar road, and he died in
hospital in north Mogadishu on the following day, the coordination
body said in a news release issued in Kenyan capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The release said that preliminary investigations over the past
three days indicated that the murder and shootings were the acts
of bandits.
</P>
<P>
The organization noted that the communities of Mogadishu, Lower
and Middle Shabelle must understand that such incident undermines
the international capacity to provide assistance to Somalia.
</P>
<P>
It recommended discontinuing aid activities in the area where
the murder took place until immediate steps taken to apprehend
those responsible, calling for commitment by communities in the
concerned area to enhance the safety of humanitarian workers.
</P>
<P>
U.N. agencies on Monday suspended all activities in southern
Somalia for at least five days in response to the murder of Ayub.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, an Islamic memorial service will be
held Friday for Ayub in some areas in Somalia including Johar,
Baidoa, Bossaso and Hargeisa as well as at the U.N. complex in
Nairobi.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture Bank Raises Loans on Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Agriculture Bank of China
(ABC), one of China's four major commercial banks, has
significantly increased its loans on infrastructure in recent
years, with the current outstanding amount for these loans pegged
at more than 21 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The latest report from ABC showed that the bank increased 1.09
billion yuan in loans for building of rural power grids,
telecommunications networks and other infrastructure construction
in July, accounting for 11.8 percent of the total increased amount
of monthly loans.
</P>
<P>
Before 1994, ABC was a specialized bank which was only allowed
to extend credit to rural areas. In 1994, the bank's annual loan
in infrastructure was less than three billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, ABC's loans for infrastructures surged to 6.9 billion
yuan in 1997, due to the fast growth of rural economy and the
commercialization of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Boosted by China's increased investment in infrastructure, the
agriculture bank's outstanding amount of loans in this area
increased to 10.6 billion yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
At that time, nearly 80 percent of the loans went to road
construction. It wasn't until China re-adjusted the flow of loans
that the focus of ABC's loans shifted from road construction to
power grid, energy, telecommunications and urban construction.
</P>
<P>
ABC settled 46.7 billion yuan of loans in government treasury
bonds to build power grid this year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998, the bank provided loans of 20 billion yuan in power
grid construction, 11 billion yuan in road building and 900
million yuan in telecommunications.

<HEADLINE> Iran a Factor of Regional Stability: Austrian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Austrian President
Thomas Klestil said here Tuesday that Austria considers Iran as a
vanguard in preserving order and stability in the region and
attaches great importance to promote ties with the Islamic
republic.
</P>
<P>
Klestil, who arrived here Monday afternoon on a two-day visit,
made the remark in a meeting with Chairman of the State Expediency
Council Hashemi Rafsanjani. The council is one of the most
important political organs in the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, the former Iranian president, criticized the
double-standard and biased approach of western countries, the
U.S. in particular, towards Iran especially in the fields of human
rights, terrorism and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
He said "Iran itself is a victim of terrorists who have been
stationed in the U.S. and certain European countries for years."
</P>
<P>
He also said that "despite the membership of the Islamic
Republic of Iran in the International Atomic Energy Agency and
permanent supervision of the organization over Iran's nuclear
activities, unfortunately negative propaganda is being launched in
the U.S. and a number of European countries to prevent Iran's
peaceful use of nuclear energy."
</P>
<P>
"This is why the occupying regime of Al Qods (Jerusalem) has
openly admitted possession of weapons of mass destruction and
nuclear weapons but has not been subjected to any protest," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani then elaborated on principles of Iran's detente
policy, expansion of relations with neighboring countries, efforts
to strengthen peace and security in crisis-stricken areas and
expansion of relations with European countries on the basis of
mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Iran and the EU have been improved since moderate
President Mohammad Khatami took office in 1997. Khatami paid a
landmark visit to Italy in March, which was considered a step in
opening links with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Expressing content with the upward trend of Tehran-Vienna ties,
Rafsanjani also voiced hope that the visit by Klestil, the first
EU head of state to visit Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution,
will serve to boost bilateral ties and cooperation with Vienna and
other EU countries.
</P>
<P>
Austria has 20 firms in Iran, which earn 230 million
U.S. dollars each year from exports of Austrian products to Iran.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Klestil said that unfortunately the image that is
presented of Iran in the U.S. and Europe, especially in a number
of mass media, does not correspond with the realities in Iran.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that as a result of exchange of views during
his visit, he would be able to present a clear and real picture of
the Islamic republic to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Vienna's willingness to improve bilateral ties and
cooperation, Klestil said his country has always tried to have a
proper and real understanding of Iran's status and to establish
ties based on understanding and wisdom by adopting an impartial
stance.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that Austria's stance included its refusal to
join the economic sanctions imposed on Iran by the West and the
U.S., and its observance of impartiality toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
Exchange of high-ranking political, economic and cultural
delegations have indicated Vienna's understanding of the realities
in Iran and its resolve to promote all-out ties with Tehran, he
added.

Vietnam News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which opened on Monday, was jointly organized by
Vietnam's Ministry of Health and the Southeast Asian Medical
Information Center (SEAMIC).
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the number of dengue sufferers in the

still, there has been no vaccine to prevent nor medicine to cure
the disease.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the number of dengue patients in Vietnam saw a 219
percent year-on-year increase with 234,000 cases found in 56 out
of 61 provinces and cities nationwide. The disease also caused the
death of over 300 people last year.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the seminar shared experiences and discussed
measures to resolve outstanding issues in dengue research. They
also worked together to find out proper solutions suitable to the
specific conditions of each country as well as of the region.
</P>
<P>
SEAMIC members agreed to join efforts in designing a program to
conduct research on dandy fever for effective treatment measures.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the seminar, Vietnam's Deputy Health Minister Le
Ngoc Trong said that the Vietnamese government has paid great
attention to and poured considerable investment in the dengue
control program over the past year. The program has since 1998
become one of the national health care programs.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Austrian President
Thomas Klestil here on Tuesday lauds Iran's stances against
terrorism and production and development of nuclear and mass
destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
Talking with Iranian Majlis (parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri, the first west European head of state to visit Iran
pledged to help make news about Iran transparent and remove the
anti-Iran propaganda of the West, the official Islamic Republic
News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said Klestil also praised the rule of law, promotion of
democratic behavior and observation of women's rights in Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran's stances in international fora are "valuable" for
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Calling for consolidation of relations between Tehran and
Vienna in all fields, Klestil said Austria attaches great
significance to Iran's special role in the region.
</P>
<P>
An Austrian economic delegation has arrived in Iran to exchange
views with Iranian officials on economic cooperation between the
two countries and to work out a long-term strategy for this
purpose, he added.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Nateq-Nouri said there are proper grounds for
expansion of relations between Iran and Austria, which can also
serve as an important factor for expansion of relations with the
EU.

<P>
The Iranian top legislator said all affairs in his country are
handled on the basis of law and that the Majlis has sufficient
supervision over state of affairs.

Referring to his country as an advocate of peace and detente in
the region and the world, he said that international organizations

<HEADLINE> Filipinos Nationwide Rally to Mark Martial Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Filipinos rallied
nationwide Tuesday to mark the 27th anniversary of the declaration
of martial law on September 21, 1972 by late president Ferdinand
Marcos.
</P>
<P>
In Manila, some 3,000 people held a noise barrage Tuesday
evening during an anti-charter change rally to cap their
commemoration activities.
</P>
<P>
Despite the use of drums and empty cans to make noise by the
protesters, the rally was peaceful and orderly, police said.
</P>
<P>
The noise barrage began at about 6 p.m. and ended at 6:25 p.m.
as a battery of speakers spoke against the charter change being
batted by President Joseph Estrada, saying it may pave the way for
the resumption of martial law.
</P>
<P>
In Santo Domingo church, Jaime Cardinal Sin, archbishop of
Manila and anti-charter change proponent, officiated at a mass
heard by some 1,000 people led by former president Corazon Aquino.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Aquino's husband, late senator Benigno Aquino Jr., was
assassinated at the Manila International Airport in 1983, sparking
the 1986 People's Power Revolt that toppled the Marcos government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government assured the nation that there would
be no repeat of the martial law years under the Estrada
administration, and the proposed charter change only includes
economic provisions.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said the 1987 Constitution
already provides enough safeguard to make sure martial law is
declared only in case of rebellion or invasion, or threat to
public safety.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1987 Constitution, the president can declare martial
law for a maximum of 60 days, but the fate of its extension rests
with Congress.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Zamora said, even if the president declares it, there is
now a system of checks and balances to make sure the abuses of the
past are not repeated.
</P>
<P>
At press time, some rallies were still going on.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Says Israeli Execution of Wye Accord Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said on Tuesday that Israel has so far well implemented the
first phase of the revised Wye peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remark after meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in Egypt's Mediterranean port city of Alexandria to
brief Mubarak on the latest developments of the peace talks
between Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat praised as a good step Israeli implementation of the
revised Wye accord and expressed belief that more positive steps
will follow under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel signed the accord on September 5 in
Egypt. Five days later, Israel transferred 7 percent of the West
Bank, approximately 400 square kilometers, to the Palestinians.
The next two pullbacks will be in November and January.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have kicked off the final status talks on the
thorny issues including Palestinian statehood, Jerusalem,
Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Arafat frequently visits Egypt to consult with Mubarak on the
peace talks with Israel. He later flew to the United States, where
he will address the United Nations General Assembly in New York on
Thursday and meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Supports China's Joining WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia fully supports
the joining of China in the World Trade Organization (WTO), said
International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She told reporters after attending a function here that
Malaysia does not want to see anyone continue to obstruct China's
participation in the world body.
</P>
<P>
She said everyone knows that it is very important for China to
take part in the world trade activities.
</P>
<P>
She said the WTO should let China be a member of the family as
early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said, "Malaysia fully supports China's joining."
</P>
<P>
She is of the view that in the WTO, developing countries must
play a more active role, saying they should at first be united to
safeguard their own interests, and must actively and positively
participate in the WTO action agenda formation.
</P>
<P>
She hoped that the proposals to be put forth by Malaysia at the
coming WTO conference in Geneva in November would be supported by
more developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Iran Willing to Develop Ties with Europe: Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday that his country has opted
for developing relations with Europe.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Austrian President Thomas Klestil,
Khamenei warmly welcomed the European guest and said Iran firmly
stands by its relations with world countries, especially those
chosen by Iran.
</P>
<P>
But it is normal that any attempt to impose something on Iran
would be followed by Iran's reaction, he said at the meeting,
which was also attended by Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei also expressed optimism about the outcome of president
Klestil's negotiations with Iranian officials. Klestil brought a
80-member businessmen delegation.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said the friendly relations between Iran and Austria
have a 500 year background and the Iranian nation has no bad
memory of Austria.
</P>
<P>
Klestil, who arrived here Monday afternoon on a two-day visit,
is the first head of state of the European Union (EU) member
countries to visit Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Iran and the EU have remained cool since the
revolution. But moderate president Khatami has taken measures to
improve relations with the EU since assuming office in 1997. He
paid a landmark visit to Italy in March, which was widely
considered a step in opening links with the EU.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Khamenei stressed that Iran and Austria
should work to strike a balance in their trade.
</P>
<P>
Austria has 20 firms in Iran, which earn 230 million U.S.
dollars each year from exports of Austrian products to Iran. That
is about 10 times more than Iranian exports to Austria, which
mostly are carpets and dried fruits.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Rises to Monthly Record in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. trade deficit soared
to a monthly record of 25.2 billion dollars in July as imports
rose to an all-time high, the Commerce Department reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that the trade deficit jumped by 2.4
percent in July, surpassing the June imbalance of 24.6 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
July's report showed that U.S. trade imbalance has climbed to
new highs for seven straight months, pushing the gap between
imports and exports to an annual rate of 247 billion dollars, far
above last year's record deficit of 164.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports in July surged by 1 percent to an all-time high of
104.2 billion dollars because a big demand for foreign autos,
capital goods and consumer goods all set monthly records.
</P>
<P>
The imports' increase offset a 0.5 percent rise in exports of
U.S. goods and services to 79 billion dollars, their highest level
since last November.
</P>
<P>
The advance in the deficit in July was unexpected by analysts.
They had been forecasting a slight narrowing after a string of
record monthly highs.
</P>
<P>
The deficits with Japan jumped 8 percent in July to a record
high of 6.8 billion dollars, while the deficit with Western Europe
also set a record high, soaring by 38.2 percent in July to 6.8
billion dollars. The United States also set a record deficit with
its largest trading partner, Canada, of 3.3 billion dollars, a
27.9 percent rise over the June level.
</P>
<P>
The 0.5 percent gain in U.S. exports occurred despite the fact
that farm sales fell by 1.9 percent to 3.8 billion dollars with
shipments of wheat, corn, soybeans, fruit and vegetables all
falling. Exports of U.S.-made autos also fell in July, dropping 6
percent to 6.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
But offsetting these declines was a 4 percent jump in exports
of U.S. capital goods, led by semiconductors and medical
equipment, pushing this category up to 25.9 billion dollars, the
highest level since last October.
</P>
<P>
Exports of consumer goods, including household goods, medicine
and records and tapes, also posted an increase of 2.7 percent, to
6.7 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Update: Toll in Taiwan Quake Rises to 1,674 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the massive
earthquake which struck Taiwan early this morning rose to 1,674 by
10 p.m. tonight, with 3,924 injured, 2,650 feared trapped in the
rubble and 219 missing, media reports monitored here said.
</P>
<P>
According to data from the Chinese mainland's earthquake
networks, the quake measured 7.6 on the Richter scale. Its
epicenter was in southwest Hualien, 145 kilometers (90 miles) from
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The quake occurred at 1:47 a.m.(Beijing Time) and was followed
by at least 13 aftershocks, causing heavy loss of life and
property damage.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin extended his condolences to
victims of the quake this morning, saying that "the quake hurt the
hearts of people on the mainland as the Chinese people on both
sides of the Taiwan Straits are as closely linked as flesh and
blood."
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to offer any possible assistance to alleviate
the quake-caused losses," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Daohan, president of the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) also offered sympathy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Wang said that he was "shocked and
grieved" to learn that the devastating quake has resulted in so
many deaths and extensive property loss for the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross Society of China (RCSC) has pledged to provide
emergency assistance, including 100,000 U.S. dollars in relief
funds and 500,000 yuan worth of relief materials to the
earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
In a message to its Taiwanese counterpart, the RCSC says that
it is willing to provide any help needed to the quake victims.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Understanding of Iran Improves: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The European countries'
understanding of Iran has improved and proper grounds have been
provided for expansion of economic cooperation between Europe and
Iran, Iranian Industries Minister Gholamreza Shafei said here
Tuesday, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Iran-Austria joint economic gathering in the
Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Mines (CCIM), Shafei said the
current visit to Iran by the Austrian delegation headed by
President Thomas Klestil can be an effective move to further boost
economic and industrial ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Lauding the good relations between Iran and Austria, Shafei
said Austrian companies had active and effective role in Iran's
economic and industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between the two countries amounted to 282
million U.S. dollars, including 19 million dollars worth of
non-oil goods, in 1998, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He called on industrialists and traders in both countries to
expand cooperation, particularly in non-oil exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He added that Austria can help Iranian companies enter into
European markets and help with finalization of trade contracts
between Iran and European countries.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the meeting, CCIM head Alinaqi Khamoushi
expressed hope that Austria would help Iran in international fora
to remove the discriminatory approaches, especially in economic
fields, towards Iran, which is under strict sanctions by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Citing the stability and security of foreign capitals in Iran,
he called on insurance companies to list Iran among less-dangerous
countries.
</P>
<P>
Klestil, heading a high-ranking political and economic
delegation, arrived here Monday on a two-day official visit, the
first by a west European head of state since the 1979 Islamic
Revolution in Iran.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Makes Progress in Payment Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has succeeded in
reducing time under which cheques were cleared from about 28 days
to just about four days, a senior Zambian government official said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cheques will eventually be cleared in one day, Deputy Minister
of Finance and Economic Development, Godfrey Simasiku, said when
officially opening a three-day workshop on payment system
sensitization.
</P>
<P>
As part of the payment modernization process, an electronic
cheque clearing system for all commercial banks registered in
Zambia started operating Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new system operating at clearing houses in capital Lusaka
and some other cities in the country will replace the manual
clearing process, which is to be phased out in next six months.
</P>
<P>
Simasiku said that a modernized payment system in Zambia will
be a big tool for improving trade within the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
Zambia is the member of both regional groupings.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian financial sector has been fraught with a number of
serious weaknesses, especially the inefficient national payment
system, said the deputy minister.
</P>
<P>
This in turn has undermined the deepening of Zambia's financial
markets and inhibited efficient operations of the banking system,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
"An efficient payment system is a vital anchorage to
governments efforts to achieve economic prosperity," Simasiku
said.
</P>
<P>
"Hence, the modernized payment system means that funds will be
available to both savers and investors and thus contribute
significantly to our ultimate goal of economic growth and poverty
reduction," he added.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said this is a critical economic function
as it will make the idle resources available to investors for
productive use and therefore generate the much needed employment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same function, Deputy Governor of the Bank of
Zambia, Abraham Mwenda, said that the modernized payment system
will improve and strengthen the capacity of the bank to supervise
commercial banks and other financial institutions.

BELGRADE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. representatives in
Kosovo and leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) reached an
agreement Tuesday on demilitarizing the KLA and reorganizing it
into a civilian organization, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. special representative Bernard Kouchner and KFOR Commander
Lieutenant General Mike Jackson signed the accord transforming the
KLA into the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC) with former KLA leaders
Hashim Thaci and Agim Ceku in KFOR headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, KPC will serve as a 5,000-strong civilian
force tasked with the responsibility of reconstruction and
emergency relief work.
</P>
<P>
After marathon bargaining, the two sides agreed that KPC will
be equipped with a maximum of 200 sidearms, to be used for
personal protection.
</P>
<P>
KLA was supposed to be demilitarized before September 19, a
deadline set a hundred days ago by NATO and Yugoslavia, which
insisted on a complete disbanding of the armed Albanian rebel
group.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug lashed out at the West's demobilization deal, saying the
KLA would remain virtually unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav news agency branded the agreement as a "farce" as
the KLA had virtually maintained the structure of their terrorist
organization, kept their weapons, are receiving huge support...and
their crimes remain unpunished.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Syrian Talks on Agenda of Barak's European </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak started a two-day visit to Germany and France Tuesday, which
is expected to focus on Europe's role in the Middle East peace
talks, particularly in the resumption of Israeli-Syrian
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Barak left Tuesday afternoon for Berlin, becoming the first
world leader to officially visit the newly-restored capital of
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Barak will hold talks with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
later Tuesday, and will meet French President Jacques Chirac in
Paris Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has indicated its interest in playing a
mediating role in the Middle East peace talks, and France is
particularly interested in helping Israel and Syria, with which
it has good relations, to resume their talks, which broke off
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al Sharaa paid a surprise visit
to Paris over the weekend, reportedly briefing Chirac on Syria's
position on a possible resumption of talks with Israel ahead of
Barak's visit.
</P>
<P>
Damascus has demanded that the two sides restart talks from
where they were left off in 1996, saying that the former Israeli
governments of Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres had made a
commitment to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a
strategic plateau seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Barak, however, has been vague on his position on restarting
the talks. His aides have said Israel is prepared to restart the
talks from where they broke off, but with different interpretation
of what the point is.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot, the widest-read newspaper in Israel, reported
earlier this week that the United States has proposed a
compromise proposal, offering to keep the opening proposals by
the two sides unpublished and "in escrow" until talks are
concluded.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted unnamed Israeli officials as saying that
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would present this
plan to Sharaa and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy when they
attend the ongoing annual session of the United Nations General
Assembly in New York.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who will hold separate talks with Sharaa and Levy in
New York, has also arranged a breakfast meeting later this week
during which Levy will meet with an array of Arab foreign
ministers. Sharaa has yet to respond to the invitation.
</P>
<P>
Both Barak and Levy renewed their call Tuesday for an immediate
resumption of talks with Syria.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian security force on
Tuesday arrested three of four people accused of firing at a
police force.
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place after a truck carrying the four men
drove onto the Cairo-Suez highway from a road in the desert, the
country's Middle East News Agency quoted Interior Ministry sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
When the police force tried to stop the truck for inspection,
one of the men opened fire at the force while the vehicle was
driven to another desert road leading to a mountainous area, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The truck was later ambushed and three men, including the one
who fired at the police force and another with a criminal record,
were arrested, they added. A fourth man remained fugitive.
</P>
<P>
The sources did not identify the men.
</P>
<P>
This was the first report about violence in Egypt after
President Hosni Mubarak was attacked and slightly injured on
September 6 by a knife-wielding man in northern Port Said. The man
was shot dead by Mubarak's guards.

BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- When New China came into

In 1998, more than 98 percent of the country's cargo delivery

Statistics show that the volume of internal combustion engines

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rose in Tokyo
Tuesday on expectations that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) would ease
its monetary grip during the day's policy board meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped 357.53 points, or 2.03
percent, from Monday's close to end at 17,932.79.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
first section issues, gained 10.05 points or 0.66 percent to 1,529.
33.
</P>
<P>
Expectations of an easier Bank of Japan monetary stance
supported Tokyo stock prices throughout the day, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section increased to 561.76 million
shares from 534.20 million shares Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the first section, losers surpassed
gainers 640 to 574 despite the overall gain, with 129 issues
ending unchanged.
</P>
<P>
After the Bank of Japan Policy Board voted to keep its current
monetary policy unchanged, the U.S. dollar fell sharply against
the yen on heavy selling on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange.
</P>
<P>
At 5 p.m., U.S. currency was quoted at 105.40-45 yen, down from
106.39-41 yen at 9 a.m., and from 105.95-106.05 yen in New York
overnight. The dollar traded at 107.90-93 yen in Tokyo late Monday.
</P>
<P>
The BOJ's decision was really surprising, a dealer said, adding
that investors were all rushing to sell the dollar after the
central bank's announcement came in at 4:55 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Most investors expected the BOJ would decide to further ease
its monetary grip at its meeting Tuesday, prompting some early
buying of the dollar, the dealer said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Proposes Regional Economic Growth Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister
Shah A.M.S. Kibria Tuesday proposed the formation of a regional
economic growth zone comprising Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar
and Nepal with a perspective of "shared benefits."
</P>
<P>
"I see an immense opportunity in a growth quadrangle in South
Asia in view of its natural resources and features of being a
compact geographical region," he said at a two-day international
dialogue here, organized jointly by the Dhaka-based Center for
Political Dialogue and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and Pacific of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
A possible growth zone consisting of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,
Myanmar and Nepal would attract more foreign investment because of
the region's natural resources and geographical location, he said.
</P>
<P>
The zone would create a new dimension of development in South
Asia, said the finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Each of the countries must have a policy framework at state
level to promote such a cooperative zone besides a "spontaneous
trend" of businesses driven by prospects of profit, and all the
regional countries "must feel that none would take advantage over
others," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the change of history, "the geography remains the same"
and in recent days the possibility of a growth zone on the basis
of geography have come up with a new dimension, according to
economist Rehman Sobhan.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the concept of growth zones, he said these zones put
their emphasis on geographical contiguity, which provides for a
shared infrastructure and resource base whose optimum use might
demand cross-border cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Academics, business leaders, officials and politicians from
Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and the Philippines are attending
the two-day meeting which began here Tuesday.

HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Pre-championship South
Korea was never seriously in trouble in a 50-minute battle on
Tuesday, overwhelming low-rated Kazakhstan 3-0 here at the Asian
Women's Volleyball Championship.
</P>
<P>
With the win, South Korea has become the first team to sail
into the round-robin finals for which top two finishers from each
group can qualify.
</P>
<P>
"So far so good," said Kim Cheol Yong, who re-coached South
Korea's national team early this year after South Korea suffered
loss at the Bangkok Asian Games at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under Kim's coaching in the early 1990s, South Korea surprised
China to win the Hiroshima Asian Games in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the luster-lack game, South Korea did not meet much
resistance from Kazakhstan before they headed for a comfortable 25-
10, 25-16 and 25-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
Looking at the next match against China, Kim predicted that it
will be an even match.
</P>
<P>
In another match on Tuesday, Australia scored its first win in
the tournament by toppling Uzbekistan 3-2 (12-25, 20-25, 25-10, 25-
18 and 15-11).
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan has lost three matches in a row without one victory.
</P>

On Wednesday, South Korea is to face China to determine who
will top Group B while Japan and Thailand, both with two victories
against no loss, will vie for the winner of Group A.

<HEADLINE> Chinese State Firms in Strategic Reshuffle (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under the ambitious program, China will focus the state sector
on strategic and key industries instrumental to the country's
national interests and overall economic strength.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are to be made to support the development of hundreds
of major enterprise groups that controls the lifeline of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
In the past 50 years, the state-owned sector saw rapid growth,
and a complete industrial system now has been established.
</P>
<P>
But shortcomings still exist in the structure, distribution and
mechanisms of the state sector - and state firms- are now blamed
for irrational structure and lack of competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Finance show that the country's
238,000 state firms cover nearly every field. With poorly
concentrated funds and efforts, these firms have failed to do the
job which should be done by the government.
</P>
<P>
The repetition of construction and redundancy also hindered the
development of the state sector. The low-level duplication of
construction caused high inventories, forcing China to import
large quantities of high value-added products every year.
</P>
<P>
Compared with world-renowned enterprises, China's firms are
generally small in size, and the country's three largest auto
producers now produce only 33.6 percent of the vehicles in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese State Firms in Strategic Reshuffle (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economic insiders point out that the strategic reshuffle will
not weaken the state sector, but rather concentrate limited state
funds in the areas of real need.
</P>
<P>
Experts suggest that the state firms play a controlling role in
economic fields touching upon national security and social
stability, and maintain a dominant role in infrastructure and
vital basic industries.
</P>
<P>
In the backbone industries, such as machinery, electronics and
petrochemicals, China should support a group of large
conglomerates to promote the competitiveness of China's economy in
the world economy, according to some experts.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle of the state sector does not mean selling off all
the firms, says one high-ranking official. He blames the practice
of "selling state firms out" in some areas as the reason for the
loss of state assets and arrears of debt, encroaching on the
interests of their employees. This tendency has been curbed under
the guidance of policies adopted by the central government.
Experts agree that property transactions must be made in
accordance with a complete legal system, adding that China now
lacks such a system.

people can get a free 30-day single entry visa in each other's
embassies or on border posts and the above-mentioned period can be
extended in the immigration offices of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The decision of easing the movement between the two countries
has been hailed as a good move to consolidate regional cooperation
between the two land-locked small central African states.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached Monday at the end of a one-day
meeting between the Burundian immigration officials and their
Rwandan counterparts, official sources in Kigali were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Burundian delegation Colonel Gerard Ncishahayo said
that the visa requirement has been maintained because of security
problems haunting the region at present.
</P>
<P>
When the situation has improved, the visa will no longer be
necessary, he added.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached following the talks held in Burundian
capital Bujumbura late last August between the Rwandan and
Burundian foreign ministers, who examined among other things free
movement of people and goods between the two countries,
cooperation in security and judicial domains.

<HEADLINE> From Soldier to Entrepreneur: Founder Group President Zhang Zhaodong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Zhaodong was born in
1949 two months after the founding of the People's Republic of
China. Now he, along with other Chinese born that same year, will
celebrate their birthday together with their motherland -- the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhaodong, now president of China's famous computer
enterprise the Beijing University Founder Group Corp, was born in
December 1949 in Linhai County in east China's Zhejiang Province,
and his growth is closely linked with that of New China.
</P>
<P>
"I had thought of being a soldier or taking some other job, but
I never thought of being president of a company. I didn't have
that concept then," Zhang smiled.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhaodong, at the age of 18, like all Chinese, was unable
to escape the chaos of the "Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976) which
swept all of China.
</P>
<P>
Upon graduating from high school, he and thousands of others
the same age went to rural areas for "re-education." He became a
soldier in the Inner Mongolia Production and Construction Corps in
north China.
</P>
<P>
At that time, Zhang did many jobs including accountant and
warehouseman, along with reclaiming land and harvesting wheat.
What remains indelible in his memory is that he was responsible
for purchasing food for over one hundred people in his corps.
Whenever he went to buy food, he was in a high state of anxiety,
like going to a battlefield, he recalls.
</P>
<P>
He was very "simple-minded" at that time, and felt a high
responsibility for everything. "I just wanted to perfectly
complete every duty assigned to me to avoid other people's
complaints." This responsible attitude remained with Zhang all his
life, and because of it, he was given an "excellent soldier" award.

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- India and France will
jointly launch a new climate mission called the "Megha Tropiques,"
that will throw open a fresh perspective on weather forecasting on
a long-term basis.
</P>
<P>
A special remote sensing satellite jointly developed by the
Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and the French National
Center for Space Studies is scheduled to be launched in 2005.
</P>
<P>
In his address at the first Indo-French meet on value-added
service using remote sensing for industries in Hyderabad, ISRO
Chairman Dr. K. Kasturirangan said India's expertise in remote
sensing satellite and the French know-how in instrumentation would
see the beginning of a new aerial platform to study the climate in
various dimensions.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India, the focus of "Megha
Tropiques" is to study climate patterns and develop a scientific
model for weather forecasting that could benefit farmers, planners
and industries.

<P>
Zhang doesn't regard his years in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region as a waste of his time, life, or talent. "Every life
experience is useful, for you must learn from your successes and
failures," said Zhang, adding that from that experience, he not
only stood the test, also gained strength and ability.
</P>
<P>
In 1973, China had not yet resumed the national college
entrance examination, but Zhang was recommended for admittance to
Beijing University. From the rural area in Inner Mongolia to the
capital city, Zhang just took this as shifting to another job, and
all he needed to do was to accomplish this job better. Four years
later, he was teaching at the university.
</P>
<P>
It was beyond Zhang's imagination that he had gone from a
soldier to a university teacher, but an even more unimaginable
thing lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Zhang Zhaodong decided to go to work for a small
company which had received 400,000 yuan (48,200 U.S. dollars) from
Beijing University, and which later became the famed Beijing
University Founder Group Corp. By 1997, his company was generating
production valued at nearly six billion yuan, and had become one
of China's five-hundred largest enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Zhang attributes his achievements to the "reform and opening up
to the outside world" policy promoted by China's late leader Deng
Xiaoping. Zhang and other intellectuals wanted to invigorate China
's economy by utilizing their knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 30 years, Zhang's roles continued to change: from
soldier to teacher to salesman and then to president of a large
company. Whatever the work, Zhang said frankly that he always made
efforts toward the same goal, that is "to try my best at
everything".

<HEADLINE> 85% of Gas in Angola's Oil Fields Runs to Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Some 290 billion cubic feet of
gas, or 85 percent of the associated gas with petroleum produced
in Angola's oil fields, run to waste every year, Angolan Minister
of Petroleum Botelho de Vasconcelos said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a document released here, the minister expressed his anxiety
over the utilization of the wasted gas, which was burned out by
the operators when it came out along the oil well to the surface.
</P>
<P>
Vasconcelos said that in the Province of Cabinda, a northwest
"enclave", the local government has had a project for gradually
decreasing the amount of the burned gas, hoping to reduce it to
zero in three to four years.
</P>
<P>
Experts in other oil fields are also seeking the best way of
taking advantage of the gas.
</P>
<P>
The minister also appealed to the international petroleum
enterprises operating in Angola to help his country undertake
technical innovation.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum industry is the biggest industry in Angola which
is the second largest oil-producing country in sub-Saharan Africa,
with a daily production of 780,000 barrels.

that increased coordination and cooperation between China and
Belarus on international issues is not only in the best interest
of both peoples, but will also contribute to peace and stability
in the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
Fu, also member of the Central Military Commission, said this
during a meeting with his Belarussian counterpart M. Kozlov, who
is on a four-day goodwill visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that the world is developing toward multi-polarization,
with the demand for peace, stability and development becoming an
irreversible trend. However, he continued, hegemony and power
politics still exist, and are even a part of current international
situations.
</P>
<P>
The "gunboat policy" of some big countries has alarmed and
alerted the international community, Fu added. It is still the
responsibility of all peace-loving nations and people to promote
the establishment of a new international political and economic
order featuring peace, stability, justice and reason, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral military relations, which are an important part of
bilateral relations in general, have scored rapid development, not
only in terms of senior-level visit exchanges, but in other fields
as well. He stressed that China hopes to work together with
Belarus to bring a multi-level, multi-field army relationship into
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Kozlov said that Belarus is happy to have China as a friend who
is playing a greater role on the international stage. He also
stressed that Belarus will support China on such issues as Taiwan,
Tibet and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Kozlov arrived here this morning at the invitation of Fu.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Not Supporting Osama: Foreign Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Tuesday it
was not supporting the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden and
described Indian media reports in this regard as malicious.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf also denied
reports that the Russian Foreign Minister had written to Pakistani
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz allegedly warning Pakistan not to
support Osama's supposed terrorist activities in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"No communication has been received from Russia nor is there
any Pakistani support to Osama bin Laden," the spokesman said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Osama is accused by the United States as the No. 1 terrorist in
the world who allegedly masterminded the bomb blasts at U.S.
embassies in Tanzania and Kenya last year.
</P>
<P>
Altaf also termed as totally baseless and incorrect Indian
authorities' claim about the arrest of eight alleged Pakistani
intelligence agents in India on September 17.
</P>
<P>
"Such false and ridiculous charges have frequently been made by
the Indian side without providing a shred of evidence," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said such reports in the Indian media were officially
inspired as a part of the tendentious and malicious Indian
propaganda campaign to malign Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> WB Chief Economist Calls for Focus on Least Developed Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Senior Vice President and
Chief Economist of the World Bank Joseph Stiglitz has called for
greater focus on the least developed countries at a time when a
new round of global trade talks are due to start in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference hosted by the World Trade Organization
here Tuesday, Stiglitz emphasized the critical need for these
negotiations to be both fair and comprehensive: fair in taking
into account the interests of all, particularly the poorest; and
comprehensive in providing the scope to benefit all.
</P>
<P>
At the conference focusing on developing countries' interests
in the new millennium, Stiglitz also called for a comprehensive
approach to addressing barriers to trade, such as the abuse of
anti-dumping provisions, lax implementation of competitive
policies, and a shortage of trade facilitation assistance.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to be sensitive to special
needs of developing countries, which suffer from higher economic
volatility, weaker social safety nets, greater human needs, and
more fragile financial sectors.
</P>
<P>
"Liberalization must be carried out in such a way that it
strengthens those areas, rather than weakening them further,"
Stiglitz said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the World Bank chief economist noted the potentially
great benefits of liberalization for the developing world:
openness to the outside in general, and trade in particular can
play a central role in the development transformation.
</P>
<P>
But to show developing countries that further liberalization is
truly in their interests, he stressed, "Trade liberalization must
be balanced in agenda, process, and outcome, and it must reflect
the concerns of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
"It must take in not only those sectors in which developed
countries have a comparative advantage, such as financial services,
but also those in which many developing countries have a special
interest, such as agriculture and construction services," he added.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the WTO and World Bank economists meeting in
Geneva on September 20-21, agreed that full realization of the
potential gains requires that the agenda and process of the next
round fully reflect the concerns, capacities, and interests of the
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Develop Strategic Plans for Multimedia Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday
launched a study aimed at developing strategic plans for the
communication and multimedia industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
The study, to be carried out from this month to December this
year, is intended to provide strategic directions to the industry.
</P>
<P>
Launching the study here, Energy, Communications and Multimedia
Minister Leo Moggie said the study would devise short- and
long-term plans to achieve 10 policy objectives for the industry
with particular emphasis on establishing Malaysia as a global
communication and multimedia hub.
</P>
<P>
The government appointed Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton (Malaysia) as
consultant in devising the strategic plans, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his ministry and the firm would together
assess the current situation for the communication and multimedia
industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the consultant would be asked to set the benchmark
world class practices and to integrate findings and formulate
strategic options, develop supporting mechanisms and action plans,
establish key performance indicators and targets for the strategic
plans as well as develop implementation groupings.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his ministry would hold discussions and
conduct a workshop in November to gather feedback on the proposed
plans before the study report is finalized and presented to the
government, hopefully by the end of December this year or early
January next year.

<HEADLINE> Australia Cuts Business Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
has decided to cut company tax significantly to boost its economy
further.
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Peter Costello announced here Tuesday that the
existing company tax system would be changed and under the changes
the business tax rate will be phased down to 30 percent from 2001
to 2002, and individual taxpayers and small businesses will also
receive substantial capital gains tax cuts starting from next
July.
</P>
<P>
With the rate halved for individuals, most will pay 15 percent
to 20 percent tax on profits from the sale of shares or property.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing system, any profit from the sale of an asset
such as shares or property is taxed at the top marginal rate of
48.5 percent for those earning more than 32,335 U.S. dollars a
year. After the changes, even taxpayers in the highest tax bracket
will pay no more than 24.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The AAP quoted Costello as saying that "this gives Australia
the opportunity to produce a world competitive taxation system and
what that means is investment and jobs."
</P>
<P>
The Australian Democrats, the key senate party, said the
reforms appeared to be positive at first glance while the
opposition party said it was confident a deal could be reached.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Says Kosovo Corps To Be Formed Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana said Tuesday that he hopes the Kosovo Protection
Corps will be formed "in the very near future."
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the establishment by the UN Mission in Kosovo of a
new, multi-ethnic civilian emergency force, the Kosovo Protection
Corps, which will play an important role in civil emergency
planning and reconstruction tasks in Kosovo," the NATO chief said
in a statement on the demilitarization of the Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA), a Kosovo Ethnic Albanian separatist group against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Solana said "the successful demilitarization process" is only
the beginning of a larger effort by "the international community"
to promote reconciliation in Kosovo and to integrate former
combatants into civilian life.
</P>
<P>
"I call on all members of Kosovar society, especially former
KLA fighters, to seize this unique opportunity to build a peaceful
and stable Kosovo for the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As of today, the KLA has ceased to exist as a structured
paramilitary organization. Moreover, all weapons, required under
the Undertaking on Demilitarization, have been turned over and are
now in specially designated storage sites under KFOR (Kosovo
peacekeeping force) control," Solana said.
</P>
<P>
"Any individuals who are found to be violating these
undertakings will be dealt with severely by KFOR. Any non-
authorized weapons found will be confiscated," the NATO chief
added.
</P>
<P>
NATO officials said the new Kosovo civilian corps will consist
of no more than 3,000 active members and 2,000 reservists. But
some KLA leaders have opposed placing their rebel fighters in a
new force with purely civilian tasks and have demanded another
form of military force with more weapons.
</P>
<P>
The former rebel leaders even said openly that they regard the
new corps as the centerpiece of a military defense against a
future invasion by Yugoslav government troops. The dispute between
NATO and the rebel group delayed the demilitarization deadline for
two days.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe the NATO is still using the rebel group
as a balancing chip against Yugoslavia in Kosovo, a province of
Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant sovereign republic.

<HEADLINE> China to Adopt Major Measures to Curb Soil Erosion Along Yangtze River (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China will take a series of
important measures to bring soil erosion along the upper and
middle reaches of the Yangtze River under absolute control.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Forestry Administration (SFA) said
that these measures include a total ban on logging of all forests,
the return of all farmland on mountain sides to afforestation, and
much stronger financial support from the central government.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China imposed a ban on the felling of natural forest
and ordered that hilly farmland be returned to afforestation in
the area.
</P>
<P>
Sector insiders say that these measures are unprecedented in
the country's efforts to control soil erosion, demonstrating the
government's firm determination in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The measures may also allow individuals to contract barren land
and mountains to plant trees and look after state-owned forests,
an act that will encourage people to preserve and protect forests,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Basin, home to some 340 million people, is
the country's major economic powerhouse, whose industrial and
agricultural output values account for about 34 percent and 40
percent, respectively, of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the deluge along the Yangtze caused tremendous
economic losses, and experts attributed the flood mainly to the
destruction of vegetation and serious soil erosion along the upper
reaches of the river.

<HEADLINE> China to Adopt Major Measures to Curb Soil Erosion Along Yangtze River (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hu Peixing, deputy-director of SFA's Ecological Programs, said
that the expected increased funds from the central government will
mainly be spent on the Shelter Forest System at the upper and
middle reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The system, one of the country's key forest ecological projects,
has expanded to 270 counties in 12 provinces from the original 145
counties in 9 provinces when it began in 1989, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary SFA figures, by the end of last year,
6.73 million ha of land in the project area had been afforested,
with forest coverage increasing to 25 percent from 19.9 percent
ten years before. And the density of forest surged 63.5 percent to
260 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the acreage of soil erosion in the project area was
reduced to 20.9 million ha from 36.2 million ha, with soil erosion
in some parts of the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze
brought basically under control.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that this project has also improved the regional
climate, reduced agricultural disasters, and raised grain output.
</P>
<P>
A SFA survey indicates that the annual precipitation in the
project area in the middle of southwestern Sichuan Province has
risen from 996 mm to 1082 mm.
</P>
<P>
In eastern Jiangxi Province, 27 counties in the project area
have witnessed a surge of clear water in more than 2,000 dried
springs and wells, while water has returned to over 1,000
previously dry valleys.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that the annual grain output in 160
counties in the project area jumped 52 percent to 26.67 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, China has spent 560 million yuan on the project,
with each ha of afforestation subsidized by 240 yuan. The amount
of funds allocated to each ha is expected to soar to some 3,000
yuan when the new measures are adopted, according to experts.

<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China will host the Fifth
Asia-Pacific Cooperative Ministers' Conference (APCMC) during
October 11-16 this year in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The conference, hosted by the Chinese Government and the All
China Federation of Supply &AMP; Marketing Cooperatives (ACFSMC), will
be the first of its kind ever held in China.

<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Airlifting of military
supplies from the Old Entebbe Airport to Uganda People's Defense
Forces (UPDF) in eastern Congo has temporarily stopped following
the grounding of the three aircraft which have been plying the
route.
</P>
<P>
Aviation officials said Monday that the two
Ukrainian-registered Ilyushin 76, owned by Knight Aviation of
London and the C-130 Hercules plane which belongs to Uganda Air
Cargo Corporation, have not flown for about two weeks, the New
Vision paper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan Ministry of Defense has run short of funds to
sustain the daily flights to the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. The debt owed to the two companies has soared to over two
billion shillings (1.4 million U. S. dollars), a military source
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Shortage of fund for the flights has caused serious
consequences including piling up of military cargo like food at
the Entebbe air base, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's military involvement in the civil war in the Congo
has drawn sharp criticism at home and abroad.

earthquake that struck Taiwan early Tuesday, a Japanese Foreign

<HEADLINE> DPRK Welcomes U.S. Ease of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea on Tuesday welcomed the announcement of the
United States to ease economic sanctions against it.
</P>
<P>
The country's state news agency, KCNA, said in a commentary
that DPRK will reciprocate the U.S. practical action to drop its
hostile policy and improve bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton formally announced last Friday that
in accordance with the results of the recent DPRK-U.S. talks in
Berlin, the United States would not list DPRK as an enemy state
and would lift a series of economic sanctions imposed upon it
under the act of trade with the enemy state, the export
administration and control act and the national defense production
act for scores of years after defining it as an "enemy state".
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted that the United States is committed to
easing sanctions against the Asian country in import and export of
goods and materials, investment in agriculture, mining industry,
infrastructure and other sectors, financial transactions, and
transport by commercial vessels and planes.
</P>
<P>
KCNA said that the step taken by Washington to fulfill its
commitments under the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework signed in 1994
was a good development, though it is not comprehensive and came
long overdue.
</P>
<P>
It urged the U.S. to show good faith by lifting the remaining
sanctions against the country so as to make it a comprehensive and
substantial measure.
</P>
<P>
Besides, if the U.S. is truly willing to totally drop its
hostile policy and better its bilateral relations with the DPRK,
it should withdraw its troops from South Korea and sign a peace
agreement with the DPRK, the commentary continued.
</P>
<P>
KCNA concluded that Pyongyang will watch closely how Washington
would practically implement what Clinton announced this time.

those involved in looting the national assets, a leading Nigerian
newspaper, The Guardian, reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Conferring with the Acting British High Commissioner to Nigeria
Monday, Foreign Minister Durbem Onyia stressed that this has
become necessary because the disturbing "huge capital flight from
our country mostly goes to the UK and other European countries".
</P>

He also urged the British government to secure relief for
Nigeria from its estimated $30 billion foreign debt, which, he
said, could affect the efforts at enthroning durable democracy.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People to Have Three-Day National Day Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese people will have
a three-day National Day Holiday instead of two according to the
regulations on holidays newly revised by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The General Office of the State Council released a notice
recently asking all areas and departments in China to ensure a
safe National Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the development of China's politics and economy,
and the people's growing needs of material and cultural life, the
State Council decided to revise the old regulations on holidays
set on December 23, 1949.
</P>
<P>
According to the revision, people will have three days off on
May 1, International Labor Day, when they used to have one day off;
and they will have one more day off on October 1, National Day.
</P>
<P>
"Altogether, the legal days off for holidays have increased
from 7 to 10 days a year," said an official with the General
Office, "The revision shows the Party's and the government's care
for people and guarantees the people's right to rest."
</P>
<P>
According to the notice released recently, departments such as
railways, civil aviation, and water and electric power stations
should ensure safety and normal operations; banks, shops and
places of entertainment, and parks and other scenic spots should
be open; and the public security sector should keep an eye on
public security.
</P>
<P>
All local governments, labor security departments, civil
affairs departments and labor unions should continue their work in
the holidays to ensure the benefits of laid-off workers, those out
of jobs, low-salary city residents, and rural single seniors, said
the notice.
</P>
<P>
The notice strictly prohibits traveling at public expense on
holidays, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Official Meets Nepalese Communist Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) said here on Tuesday that the CPC
is ready to strengthen its friendly relations of cooperation with
the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML).
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, told CPN-UML
General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal that the CPC is willing to
enhance the relationship under the principles of maintaining
independence with the initiative in one's own hands, total
equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Wei expressed appreciation for the principled stance of the CPN-
UML on the issues of Taiwan, Tibet, and human rights.
</P>
<P>
In addition, on behalf of the CPC, Wei offered condolences
again for the death of CPN-UML Chairman Man Mohan Adhikari last
April. He said the chairman made great contributions to the
development of friendship between the two parties and the two
countries, and therefore he will live always in the hearts of CPC
members and all the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Madhav Kumar Nepal expressed warm congratulations on the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on
behalf of the CPN-UML.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's epoch-making achievements over the past 50
years, especially the past 20 years, have not only helped the
Chinese people, but are also in the interest of people everywhere.
</P>
<P>
The general secretary said that the Nepalese people will insist
on the "one China" policy, and will not tolerate any attempt to
split Tibet from China, or any other anti-China activities on
Nepalese territory.
</P>
<P>
The Nepalese people will continue their efforts to maintain the
friendship between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
China and Nepal established diplomatic relations in 1955.
During President Jiang Zemin's visit to Nepal in 1996, the two
sides reached consensus on the establishment of a good-neighborly
partnership for generations to come.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Unveil New Wage for Public Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will announce new
salaries and allowances for its 600,000-strong public sector
workers within the next few weeks, chief economic adviser to
President Olusegun Obasanjo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
While opening talks with representatives from the Academic
Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) in the Nigerian capital Abuja,
Philip Asiodu said lecturers in the country's tertiary
institutions would benefit from this move.
</P>
<P>
He advised ASUU, the umbrella union for the country's
university teachers, to stop the current agitation aroused by
those demanding for improved welfare so that the government can
conclude the ongoing consideration of public sector salaries and
allowances.
</P>
<P>
"You should not only be interested in the welfare of academic
staff, but also on the stability of the academic environment," he
told the teachers who went on strike last week for better pay and
improved education conditions.
</P>
<P>
The pay hike, which would replace the prevailing public sector
wages announced by the military administration before handing over
on May 29, would hopefully end the strike.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, in the presidential campaign, had promised to pay
"living wage" to the country's public sector workers as part of an
incentive to make the sector more efficient.

The LDP's 371 legislators and 2.91 million rank-and-file
members were eligible to vote in the election. The rank-and-file
members participated in a postal vote, with 10,000 votes
equivalent to one vote by a legislator.
</P>
<P>
The reelection gave Obuchi his first full two-year term. The
Japanese prime minister is currently serving out the remainder of
the term of his predecessor, Ryutaro Hashimoto, who stepped down
last July to take responsibility for the LDP's poor showing in a
House of Councillors (upper house) election.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi is expected to accelerate talks for establishing a new
tripartite coalition among the LDP, the Liberal Party (LP) and New
Komeito, which together will account for a stable majority in both
chambers of the Diet (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, who will continue to be Japan's prime minister as the
LDP presidency carries with it the top Japanese government post,
plans to launch a new coalition cabinet after concluding a policy
agreement with the LP and New Komeito.

SEOUL, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
Tuesday endorsed a plan to send a 420-strong battalion to East
Timor as a part of the United Nations-sponsored multinational

</P>
<P>
Under the plan, a battalion of South Korean soldiers will be

The battalion's mission is aimed to restoring peace and

there.
</P>
<P>
The battalion will consist of 250 infantry soldiers and 170-man
support unit including medics and engineers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Seismologists Concerned About Taiwan Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua)-- Chinese seismologists on the
mainland are concerned about the devastating earthquake that
rocked Taiwan at 1:47 (Beijing Time) this morning.
</P>
<P>
Many seismologists rushed to their work posts at early morning
and began observing, reporting, and analyzing shortly after the
quake, in the hopes of offering some assistance to the disaster
relief work on the island, sources at the China Seismological
Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
He Yongnian, director of the cross-Straits center for the
exchange of seismological science and technology, said that "the
mainland is willing to dispatch experts to help their Taiwan
counterparts if it's necessary." He sent a message of sympathy to
his Taiwan counterparts this morning.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Seismological Bureau, the quake,
measuring 7.6 on the Richter Scale, jolted the southwestern part
of Hualien in Taiwan, 23.7 degrees north latitude and 121.1
degrees east longitude, at 1:47 (Beijing Time) this morning,
followed by at least 13 aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guomin, a research fellow with the bureau, indicated that
the low-depth earthquake, characterized by strong and frequent
aftershocks, poses a grave threat to the life and property of
people living in quake areas.
</P>
<P>
"Those characteristics also make relief work more difficult,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The special geographical location of Taiwan Island results in
frequent quakes at its peripheral regions, Zhang said, adding that
while 85 percent of the quakes jolted the sea floor, the epicenter
of today's quake was located ten kilometers below the surface of
the island's central land areas, "thus the quake was particularly
destructive."

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Lawmakers Agree on Financial Architecture Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asia needs to review
and strengthen its "financial architecture" to hasten its
recovery, ASEAN legislators agreed Tuesday during the ongoing 20th
general assembly of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organization
(AIPO).
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN (Association of the Southeast Asian Nations)
lawmakers also aired cautious optimism for the further recovery of
the region, citing the rising current account surpluses, build-up
of foreign reserves and a general "return of stability" in foreign
exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
However, they stressed in a common resolution that the ASEAN
must move towards fostering more transparency, accountability and
good governance to prepare for globalization.
</P>
<P>
"Standards of transparency and disclosure must be applied
equally to the public and private sectors," the AIPO document
states.
</P>
<P>
It added that the review of the ASEAN financial architecture
would include a review of the roles of international financial
institutions, as well as international regulatory bodies.
</P>
<P>
The delegates also asked that the ASEAN Surveillance Process,
which keeps an eye on the movement of capital and shifts in
economic indicators, be strengthened to "serve as an early warning
system of impending trouble in the future."
</P>
<P>
The assembly, which opened here on Monday, was attended by some
230 lawmakers from 17 countries of the Asean-Pacific region,
including eight AIPO member countries, two permanent observer
countries and seven observer nations.
</P>
<P>
The eight AIPO member countries are Indonesia, Singapore,
Malaysia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines and Cambodia.
The two permanent observer countries are Brunei and Myanmar.
</P>

The seven observer nations are Australia, China, Japan, Korea,
New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Russia. The Meeting will

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Two District Commissioners
and 40 district accountants have been interdicted in a major purge
to weed the government of corrupt officials, a senior Kenyan
government official has said.
</P>
<P>
Zakayo Cheruiyot, permanent secretary in charge of provincial
administration, disclosed Monday in the port city of Mombasa that
the interdicted would be arraigned in court within 10 days, saying
investigations into their corrupt dealings at their back yards
have been completed.
</P>
<P>
The government-run Times newspaper Tuesday quoted Cheruiyot as
saying the government has adopted a firm stance over corruption,
and errant officials will be dismissed instead of giving them
warning letters.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary pointed out that the interdicted
district commissioners and accountants for misappropriating
government funds should serve as a warning to those errant and
dishonest civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Lamu District Commissioner Daudi Ekwon of Coast Province has
been arrested under the charge of embezzling five million
shillings (around 67, 000 U.S. dollars) from the district
treasury.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has intensified the anti-corruption
campaign among the government officials in a bid to restore the
image of the country. The International Monetary Fund suspended a
205-million-dollar loan to Kenya in July 1997 on the grounds of
the country's rampant corruption and poor governance.

for the lifting of the U.N. sanctions, an Iraqi newspaper reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In letters sent to his foreign counterparts, Speaker of the
Iraqi National Assembly (parliament) Saadoun Hamaadi urged them to
support Iraq's just demand for lifting the nine-year-old
embargo.
</P>
<P>
Hamaadi accused the U.S. of keeping the sanctions in place
"despite Iraq's implementation of all its commitments under
relevant U.N. resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The message was sent on the advent of the convention of the 101
session of the International Parliamentary Union Conference
scheduled to be held in Berlin, Germany in October, the
national daily Al-Iraq reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi speaker described the continuous U.S.-British
aggression and the imposition of no-fly zones in northern and
southern Iraq as a flagrant violation of Iraq's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-day airstrikes
against Iraq last December, their warplanes have been regularly
attacking Iraqi civil and military targets in the no-fly zones,
causing severe civilian casualties and property damage.
</P>
<P>
The restricted zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led
western allies in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim
of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south against possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.

DAR ES SALAAM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The government has
suspended the work of five senior officials with National
Examination Council of Tanzania (NECTA) in connection with last
year's massive leakage of examination papers for National Form
Four students.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian Tuesday quoted sources within the council as
reporting that the officials were suspended for their alleged
involvement in the scandal that forced the country to hold an exam
for the students again.

The suspension has brought to 25 the total number of NECTA
employees who were suspended following the scandal that shocked
the nation.
</P>
<P>
The leakage of the examination papers across the country last
November resulted in a loss of millions of U.S. dollars as the
government was compelled to have test papers printed again in
Britain and hold a second test for the students months later.

force in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak pays an official visit to

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Opposition Alliance Vows to Make Anwar PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's opposition
alliance, the Alternative Front, said Tuesday it would nominate
jailed former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim for Prime
Ministership if it wins the next general elections.
</P>
<P>
The Alternative Front comprises Democratic Action Party (DAP),
Islam Party of Malaysia (PAS), Malaysia People's party (PRM) and
National Keadilan (Justice) Party (Keadilan).
</P>
<P>
In a statement signed by DAP Secretary-General Lim Kit Siang,
PAS President Haji Fadzil Noor, PRM President Syed Husin Ali and
Keadilan Deputy President Chandra Muzaffar, the alliance said that
Anwar, who is serving a six-year jail sentence for corruption and
is being tried for sodomy, not only has "special qualities of a
leader" but also possessed wide experience in the government
because he had held various portfolios in the Cabinet for more
than a decade,.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the Alternative Front realizes that even if it wins
the general elections, Anwar cannot assume the Prime Ministership
immediately given his six-year jail sentence that began in April
1999," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Anyone from among the four parties who commands majority
support in the Dewan Rakyat (House of Representatives) would first
be appointed temporary Prime Minister before efforts are made for
Anwar to take over, the Alternative Front said.
</P>
<P>
The front would "uphold the rule of law, protect the sanctity
of the judicial process and make efforts to get true justice for
Anwar through a judicial inquiry," it said, adding only after
justice is done would he (Anwar) be given an opportunity to lead
this country.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the Alternative Front would form a
collective leadership comprising the four parties and other
parties, as well as individuals without any political party
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
This kind of collective leadership could "contribute
effectively towards efforts to forge national unity and build a
just Malaysian society," it said, adding this collective
leadership will be truly multi-ethnic in nature, whether in terms
of its composition or orientation, although because of history its
core will be Malay.
</P>
<P>
The basic qualities forming the thrust of the collective
leadership are integrity, ability, dedication and courage,
knowledge and vision, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Promises Investigation Into Police Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Mayor Richard Riordan
promised on Monday that investigation will be conducted into one
of the biggest police scandals in the history of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Standing before reporters at City Hall with Los Angeles police
chief Bernard Parks and police commission head Jerry Chaleff,
Riordan said he was "disgusted" by criminal acts of some cops and
vowed to get "to the bottom" of it.
</P>
<P>
"Fellow Angelenos, you have my word that we are doing
everything possible to get to the bottom of this," Riordan said. "
It's unfortunate, disappointing and disgusting that any police
officer would violate the laws that he or she is sworn to uphold."
</P>
<P>
The mayor's involvement is the latest development in a 17-month
police corruption investigation that has resulted in the
suspension of 10 officers and a supervisor from the Rampart
Division and disciplinary action against one commanding officer.
</P>
<P>
At the center of the probe so far has been Rafael Perez, a
former Rampart narcotics officer who pleaded guilty last week to
stealing eight pounds of cocaine from an evidence room.
</P>
<P>
Perez, who is cooperating with authorities, has told detectives
that he and his partner, Nino Durden, shot Honduran immigrant
Javier Francisco Ovando while he was handcuffed, then framed him
for a crime he did not commit. Ovando, a member of the 18th Street
Gang, was left unable to walk.
</P>
<P>
Ovando served three years of a 23-year prison term before a
judge freed him Thursday at the request of prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Perez has also said he saw Rampart officers shoot and kill an
unarmed man during a raid on a gang hide-out and then plant guns
on him and another suspect to justify the assault.
</P>
<P>
Riordan pledged to stay involved to "ensure the integrity of
this investigation" and asked for public support for the
department.
</P>
<P>
"Do not let a few evil officers ruin the reputation of the
entire police force," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.N. Committee of Blocking Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has accused the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking 28 of its contracts signed
under the oil-for-food program, Iraqi News Agency reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed spokesman for the Trade Ministry blamed the U.S. and
British representatives at the Committee for putting on hold those
contracts during the committee's sessions on September 14 to 17.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that those contracts included agricultural
equipment, veterinary medicines, medical appliances, oil spare
parts, mobile telephone network and electrical equipment.
</P>
<P>
And they were signed with companies of India, Russia, Vietnam,
Jordan, France, Tunisia, Lebanon, China, Italy, Syria and Germany
in the fourth, fifth and sixth phases of the U.N. oil-for-food
deal, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, now in its sixth phase which
expires in November, Iraq is allowed to sell limited amount of
oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth phase of the deal, the ceiling of the amount
of oil Iraq is allowed to sell has been raised to 5.2 billion
U.S. dollars from 2 billion dollars for the first three phases.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys in
the Sanctions Committee of hampering the endorsement of its
contracts, arguing that the oil-for-food deal has failed to
alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF), mortality rates among Iraqi children have doubled
since the imposition of the U.N. sanctions in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Health Ministry announced on Sunday that nearly 8,000
Iraqi children aged under five died in last August of different
curable diseases and malnutrition.

one year and 10 percent on profits repatriated after one year.
</P>
<P>
With the new rules, the levy on profits made and repatriated
within one year would be reduced from 30 percent to 10 percent and
all profits from funds brought in on or after February 15, 1999,
are subject to a levy of 10 percent, irrespective of when the
profits are repatriated, Bank Negara (State Bank) Governor Ali
Abul Hassan said in a statement here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In what is a major boon to foreign fund managers, the effect of
this change is that there would no longer be any levy imposed on
the principal amount, he said, adding that while reducing the rate
of levy, it would also make the levy system more efficient to
administer.
</P>
<P>
This change would also facilitate the two external accounts
(normal external account and special external account) to be
merged into one.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the implementation of this change in the levy
system, the government has now addressed all the administrative
issues raised by the foreign fund managers with respect to the
levy system.

<HEADLINE> Diverse Ownership Speeds up Growth in Zhejiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The key to economic success
for east China's Zhejiang Province is to develop a diversified
ownership system while maintaining public ownership as the main
body, Provincial Governor Chai Songyue said.
</P>
<P>
By taking this road, Zhejiang has accelerated its economic
growth and maintained strong vitality, Chai said in a Xinhua
interview.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) of Zhejiang grew 13.5 percent
in the 1997-98 period, four percentage points higher than the
national average. This coastal province ranks fourth in the
country after Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin in terms of overall
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
As far back as the early 1980s, the provincial government began
encouraging local farmers to create township-run enterprises, as
the contracted responsibility system had liberated a great number
of the rural labor force, said Chai, who has been working in
Zhejiang for many years.
</P>
<P>
Local government officials further emancipated their minds and
granted a series of preferential treatments for the development of
self-employed firms in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, Zhejiang proposed treating self-employed
enterprises the same as state or collectively owned ones.
</P>
<P>
To date, the province has set up 4,600 specialized markets, all
establishing trade ties and information links with industrial
manufacturers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Self-employed enterprises now take the lion's share in the
province, accounting for 42.5 percent, followed by 40.4 percent
for collectively owned enterprises, 11.2 percent for the state
enterprises, and 5.7 percent for foreign-funded firms, Chai said.
</P>
<P>
The governor believes that the development of the state and
other economic sectors can co-exist and promote rather than repel
one another.
</P>
<P>
"The state sector in Zhejiang hasn't been eliminated. On the
contrary, it has developed much faster," Chai said.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the good points of diversified-ownership development
system, Chai said it provides a favorable environment for the
strategic readjustment and regrouping of the national economy,
offers a frame of reference for public ownership, creates numerous
job opportunities for laid-off workers, and pumps funds into
technical innovation in state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Improve Their Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- An "image project" was kicked
off among China's judicial and police departments at the beginning
of this year in an effort to improve the image of the country's
judicial workers and police officers.
</P>
<P>
In northeast China's Jilin Province, the introduction of the
image project has significantly improved the performance of police
officers. Last year, over 500 police stations across the province
were hailed by local residents as "excellent," accounting for
nearly 40 percent of the total of some 1,250.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Public Security said the image
project has pushed police departments to seriously deal with
issues crucial to ordinary people, improve police officers'
service awareness, and thereby improve their image among the great
masses.

WELLINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Support for New Zealand
Prime Minister Jenny Shipley has jumped following the 7th informal
meeting of leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation

country's largest city.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Press Association Tuesday quoted the latest New

rating has risen to 20 percent from 14 percent a month ago in the

</P>
<P>
Of those questioned, 38 percent said they have a better opinion
of the Prime Minister, with just eight percent saying they now
have a worse opinion of her.
</P>
<P>
The figure will be a boost to the ruling National Party, which
is due to announce this weekend the date for the forthcoming
general elections.
</P>
<P>
Helen Clark, leader of the Labor Party, the main rival of the
National Party in the country, is now on 18 percent support,
compared with 20 percent a month ago.
</P>
<P>
But the fortunes of the National Party in the next elections
haven't shifted significantly with its vote rising from 32 percent

relatively steady, on 39 percent support compared with 40 percent
a month ago.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Spend US$2.6 Million on Animal Genetic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Over 2.6 million U.S. dollars
will be spent on a three-year Southern African Development
Community (SADC) regional project aimed at preserving the fast
diminishing animal genetic resources.
</P>
<P>
"There was need to build an inventory on the available
livestock breeds and their genetic characteristics for the
management of the available species," Louise Setshwaelo, SADC's
chief technical advisor for a Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) project on management of farm animal genetic resources, was
quoted by Tuesday's Zambian newspaper, The Post, as saying.
</P>
<P>
She said the project would provide information for the policy
makers, farmers and other stakeholders on the region's potential
in overall food security provision and poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries director of
research and specialist services, Peter Sinyangwe, has advised
SADC member states to develop a network that will address the
obstacles hindering the preservation of animal genetic resources.
</P>
<P>
Opening a national awareness workshop on animal genetic
resources in Chisamba in Central Province on Monday, Sinyangwe
said that the rate at which animal genetic resources are
diminishing calls for combined efforts of the SADC countries to
save them.
</P>
<P>
This is inevitable if the bio-diversity of the world is to
continue to depend on it for its food security sustenance, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sinyangwe observed that the region is losing its resources at
such an alarming rate that there is need for SADC member states to
consolidate their efforts on management, sustainable use and
preservation of animal genetic resources.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militiaman Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed and another seriously wounded
in south Lebanon Tuesday morning, Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The casualties occurred when a SLA outpost in the central
sector of the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon was
hit by Lebanese guerrillas' mortar and rocket attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's Muslim Shiite military group Amal led by the House
Speaker Nabih Berri claimed that its fighters launched offensives
against several Israeli and SLA positions inside the zone,
causing direct casualties.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, Israeli army confirmed the casualties, adding
Israeli warplanes blasted suspected targets of Lebanese guerrillas
in Iqlim Toufah area on the edge of the border enclave as a
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
The fresh fatality raised to 15 the number of the SLA members
killed in south Lebanon since the start of this year while 13
Israeli soldiers lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 to protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli troops and SLA out of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army lifted
midnight Monday a full closure on the Gaza Strip and West Bank,
which was imposed before the beginning of the Jewish holiday Yom
Kippur two days ago.
</P>
<P>
Yom Kippur, or the Day of Atonement, is the holiest and most
important day of the Jewish year. It started at sunset Sunday and
ended on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The closure was the second in less than two weeks. During the
period of the Jewish New Year, or Rosh Hashanah, which fell on
September 10, the Israeli army sealed off the West Bank and Gaza
for three days amid speculations that terrorists might carry out a
major attack inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army customarily imposes closure on the West Bank
and Gaza during holiday seasons for security considerations,
barring tens of thousands of Palestinian labors from working in
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Apple Expects Lower Net Income For 4th Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Apple Computer Inc.
predicted on Monday  its net income in the fourth fiscal quarter
at between 75 million dollars to 85 million, well below the
previous quarter's.
</P>
<P>
The company, based in Cupertino, California, cited a chain of
factors behind the lower net income, including inability to get
enough of the new, super speed G4 microprocessors to fill orders
for its Power Mac G4, thus delayed shipments.
</P>
<P>
``Apple has received orders for over 150,000 Power Mac G4s
since the product was announced three weeks ago, and we regret
that we will not be able to ship them all this quarter,'' Apple
Interim Chief Executive Steve Jobs said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In its third fiscal quarter ended June 26, the computer maker
beat
financial analysts' earnings forecasts when it reported a net
income of 114 million dollars on the basis of about 1.6 billion
dollars in sales.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Clarifies E. Timor Issue in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Clarifying about East Timor
issue before the parliament, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
said Tuesday that all the government's policies on the issue have
been made in consultation with the House of Representatives (DPR).
</P>
<P>
The consultation was conducted not only by his aides but also
by himself, the head of state told the parliament here Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
By the end of January this year, he said, the government
announced an alternative proposal in case that the East Timorese
refuse the wide-ranging autonomy package, including asking the
House to use democratic and constitutional ways to consider
independence for East Timor, peacefully and respectfully.
</P>
<P>
Such an approach not only reduces the international pressure
against Indonesia, but also provides an opportunity for the people
and the government to solve other problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his 75-minute speech, Habibie said the August 30 direct
ballot ending with the victory of anti-autonomy camp was mainly
aimed at finding the final solution to the East Timor question.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Indonesia has no ambition to expand its
territory, Habibie said the East Timor dispute during the past two
decades has been worsened by certain groups, who tried to exploit
the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Those groups also twisted the facts and the government's
efforts to help the East Timorese restore peace and order in the
territory," he said.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the situation, eight U.N. resolutions and seven
U.N. Security Council resolutions have been adopted.
</P>
<P>
"As international society does not recognize East Timor as part
of Indonesia, we will maintain efforts to undertake international
ways to settle the East Timor case," he said, citing the
diplomatic actions taken by the Indonesian government after the
East Timor case came up in the U.N. in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The president said Indonesia decided to offer the wide-ranging
autonomy to East Timor through a popular consultation, with the
consideration that the region's integration into the country is
not recognized by the international community.
</P>
<P>
"The government did not have the right to release East Timor,
but it will report the result of the ballot to the General Session
of the People's Consultative Assembly (next month)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the assembly has approved East Timor's integration, it
is difficult for Indonesia to maintain it without becoming
recognized by the international community, Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
The president said Indonesia deplored what he described as the
overreaction of Australia on the East Timor issue, which he said
had not been helpful in settling the question and could harm
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Australian sentiment has surged since the Indonesian
government agreed to accept foreign peacekeepers to quell the
violence in East Timor. Some Indonesians believe Canberra, which
has been particularly critical of Jakarta's actions in East Timor,
has meddled in Indonesian affairs.

<HEADLINE> Facts &AMP; Figures On China's Township Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua)-- China's township enterprises
have scored remarkable achievements since the founding of the
People's Republic in 1949, especially since China initiated the
policy of reform and opening up in 1978, as indicated by the
following facts and figures.
</P>
<P>
China's township enterprises registered 2.2186 trillion yuan in
added value in 1998, accounting for 27.9 percent of the country's
total GDP.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises turned in 158.3 billion yuan in tax
revenue to the state in 1998, some 20.4 percent of the country's
total.
</P>
<P>
The output value of township enterprises accounted for less
than a quarter of society's total in 1978, but it surged to 52.4
percent in 1987, accounting for a larger proportion than
agricultural output value for the first time.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, township enterprises reported an industrial added
value of 1.553 trillion yuan, accounting for 46.3 percent of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
The work force in township enterprises also increased from 28
million in 1978 to 125 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Workers employed by township enterprises earned only 300 yuan a
year in the late 1980s, but currently their average annual income
is around 4,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
China had 120,000 export-orientated township enterprises in
1995, with export volume exceeding 680 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Arafat Sets Up Special Force Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat has ordered the formation of a special security force unit
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to cope with special security
issues.
</P>
<P>
Personnel for the new unit are being recruited only in the West
Bank and there are about 200 recruits to date, all of them from
Arafat's Fatah movement, the local daily Ha'aretz reported Tuesday
</P>
<P>
Bashir Nafi'a, who was born in the Kalandiya Refugee Camp about
15 kilometers from Jerusalem, has been appointed the head of the
special unit, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Bashir told Ha'aretz on Monday that the special force begins
training in about two weeks and will set up five bases in the West
Bank and at a later stage, establish a commending post in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Bashir dismissed the speculation that the formation of the
special force is meant to moderate Jibril Rajoub's power in
the West Bank, saying the situation calls for the formation of
such a force.
</P>
<P>
Rajoub is the head of the Palestinian Preventive Security
Forces in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The role of the unit is to protect the democracy, peace and
security of the people in its true sense," Bashir said, adding
that the unit will not establish prisons, but try to reach
understanding with the opposition by means of dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Bashir said he does not know whether the members of his unit
were included in the list of policemen submitted by the
Palestinian National Authority to Israel under the Sharm El
Sheikh peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Bashir was deported by Israel in April 1988 in the first wave
of expulsions from the West Bank four months after the outbreak of
the uprising. He returned to the West Bank in 1994 after signing
of the Oslo Accord.
</P>
<P>
A year later, prior to Israel's troop redeployment in the
West Bank and while Fatah was organizing internal elections,
Bashir was placed under administrative detention by Israel for
four months and held at the Ansar 3 camp in the southern
Negev desert.

<P>
Since China adopted its reform and opening up policy in 1978,
the country has used foreign funds totaling 280 billion U.S.
dollars, and become an important partner for many of the world's
multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 80 to 90 firms of the first 100 in
this year's Fortune top 500 list have invested in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 participants, including presidents and
representatives from multinational corporations from overseas as
well as Chinese companies will attend the Forum whose theme is "
China: The Next 50 Years." So far, more than 600 journalists have
registered to cover the conference.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus on business opportunities and challenges,
economic issues, and practical realities related to conducting
business in China today and in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Zhao noted that China has made every effort to ensure the
success of the forum.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai International Convention Center and the Pudong
International Airport are both now operational. The new Shanghai
International Convention Center, after trial operations, is fully
capable of meeting all the needs of the conference, said Zhao.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Oman has dropped a plan to
borrow 400 million U.S. dollars from international financial
markets to help keep budget balance for the fiscal year 1999.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in response to the recovery in oil prices
and the resulting improvement in the country's financial situation
and in the state's general budget in particular, Omani Finance
Minister Ahmed Abdul Nabi Macki was quoted on Tuesday by the
Dubai-based Gulf News daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Oman's 1999 budget included borrowing the 400 million dollars
by issuing bonds to fill the gap between the available financial
resources and the fiscal requirements for this year.
</P>
<P>
The bonds, originally due to be issued via Goldman Sachs and
Warburg Dillon Read last week, have been put on hold until next
year, bankers said.
</P>
<P>
The government had drawn the budget based on an oil price of 9
dollars a barrel, much lower than the current price of 21
dollars, they said.

<HEADLINE> Illicit Brew Kills 17 People in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 17 people have been
confirmed dead and several others hospitalized in a coma in
Kenya's Eastern Province after drinking an illicit brew, local
newspapers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The dead and those admitted who had been drinking the brew,
popularly known as Sorghum Baridi, were having a beer party at a
bar in Embu Town on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The brew, believed to be a concoction of methanol, sugar and
water, is one of the many illicit drinks banned by the Parliament
two years ago and whose consumption is rampant in Embu and Mbeere
districts in Eastern Province.
</P>
<P>
More people were admitted at the Embu provincial general
hospital on Monday evening. Hospital authorities said the death
toll might rise. At least two were confirmed to be blind.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Muraguri, a doctor at the hospital, said that the
victims died of "methanol poisoning, which is believed to have
traces of formalin, a mortuary preservative."
</P>
<P>
The police had arrested one of the proprietors of the bar and
were looking for a woman believed to own the bar.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that incidents of death after consumption of
illicit brews have increased in many parts of Kenya due to the
mushrooming of dubious manufacturers of the same.

<HEADLINE> Ford, Microsoft Form Venture to Create Online Build-to-Order Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Ford Motor Co. and
Microsoft Corp. on Monday unveiled a joint venture that will
enable the U.S. automaker to build cars according to online
orders and will advance Microsoft's efforts to enlist industry
partners in its Internet endeavors.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in San Francisco, the two companies also
announced a simpler way for consumers to design and order cars.
</P>
<P>
The alliance between the two companies underscores how e-
commerce is challenging traditional ways of doing business and
pushing the high-tech and manufacturing industries closer together.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally automakers have competed against each other with
new cars and trucks and manufacturing efficiency. Now they are
seeking technology allies to revamp their distribution systems,
cut costs and inventory, and gain the broadest access to Internet
car consumers and information about them.
</P>
<P>
Under the alliance, Ford will be Microsoft's lead partner in
CarPoint, an auto sales web site launched in 1996 offering users
complete car-buying and car-care information on all makes and
models. Now the Web site will feature an online build-to-order
system that links Internet car-ordering services to the back-end
systems of an automotive manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
For Ford, the deal represents the next phase of its "e-tailing"
strategies that include its dealers and its numerous Web site
ventures. Under the arrangement, Ford will have access to reams of
data about how shoppers search for cars online.
</P>
<P>
Ford is the world's largest producer of trucks and the second
largest producer of cars and trucks combined, marketing and
selling about seven million vehicles globally through its seven
brands last year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Eyes Planned Orchid Market as Tourist Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand hopes to develop a
planned huge wholesale market for orchids and other fresh flowers
into a tourist destination, the newspaper Bangkok Post reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry of Thailand was quoted as saying the
new market will be larger than the existing one, currently the
biggest in the country.
</P>
<P>
About 20 rai (3.2 hectares) next to the Chao Phraya River will
be developed as the market for 150 million baht (3.75 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Pongpol Adireksarn said the market would
not only be the wholesale center for fresh flowers but would also
attract tourists.
</P>
<P>
The existing market would probably be incorporated into the new
market.
</P>
<P>
The new site would be more convenient for buyers and foreign
tourists, Pongpol said, adding that the existing market is very
crowded and untidy.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's orchid exports are worth about 3 billion baht (75
million dollars) a year with Japan, Italy, the United States,
Taiwan and Hong Kong as the major buyers.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Set Up Labor Attache in Foreign Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
decided to establish a labor attache in the countries that have
more 5,000 Nepali laborers to look after their interest and
security, The Kathmandu Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the government's new regulations, the responsibilities of
labor businesses and the laborers themselves have also been
expanded.
</P>
<P>
The regulations require labor agencies to invest at least 2.5
million rupees ( 35,000 U.S. dollars) to set up business and
provide employment to at least 50 aspirants in a year. Failing to
do so would automatically terminate their license.
</P>
<P>
These agencies will also be required to find for applicants
employment that pays no less than 125 U.S. dollars per month.
</P>
<P>
They will also need to update the government every six months
on the state of these laborers and their operation. They will be
allowed to take 25 percent of the first month's salary from their
clients to buy insurance worth at least 100,000 rupees (14,000
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs exporting laborers have long complained that lack
of regulations had made their profession difficult. The new
regulations will make their operation smooth.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are more than 200,000 Nepali
laborers in the Gulf countries alone among which Saudi Arabia has
nearly 135,000 and Kuwait 40,000.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Energy Giant to Buy LNG From UAE Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. energy giant Enron
Corp. will purchase 480,000 tons per annum (tpa) of liquefied
natural gas (LNG) from Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Co. (Adgas)
of the United Arab Emirates for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The LNG will be used as feedstock for Enron Corp.'s upcoming
power plant in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, said the
Gulf News daily on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Our affiliate in India, the Dabhol Power Co. (DPC), has
completed an agreement with Adgas to purchase 480,000 tpa of
LNG. The deal is for a 20 year period and deliveries will
commence from the last quarter of 2001," Kelly Kimberly, senior
director of international public relations of Enron Corp. was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
DPC, a joint venture between Enron Corp. (80 percent
shareholder) and India's Bechtel (20 percent), is building a
power plant with a total generation capacity of 2,184 Mega Watt,
besides setting up India's first LNG receiving terminal,
regasification facilities and a gas pipeline distribution network.
</P>
<P>
Enron Corp. and Adgas have been in negotiations for the
LNG deal for the past 15 months, Gulf News said.
</P>
<P>
"We currently have a 20-year agreement with Oman LNG for
1.6 million tpa and Adgas for 480,000 tpa," she explained.
</P>

Deliveries of Omani LNG to DPC are scheduled to begin in late
2001.

<HEADLINE> Pistons Bring Back Terry Mills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Free agent forward Terry
Mills is back home with the Detroit Pistons.
</P>
<P>
After spending two injury-plagued seasons with the Miami Heat,
Mills today signed with the Piston. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Mills, a Detroit native who helped Michigan win
the national championship in 1989, spent five productive seasons
with the Pistons from 1992 to 1997 before signing with the Heat.
</P>
<P>
The 250-pound Mill is one of the few big men in the NBA who is
a 3-point shooting threat. Under the league's approved rules
changes, a defender no longer will be allowed to make contact with
his hands or forearms on an offensive player above the foul line
extended.
</P>
<P>
That should enable Pistons star Grant Hill to drive to the
basket without being bumped and kick out to 3-point shooters.
Mills converted a total of 366 3-pointers in his last three years
with Detroit.
</P>
<P>
In his five seasons with the Pistons, Mills averaged 13.5
points on 46 percent shooting and 6.2 rebounds in 394 games. He
set career-highs with 17.3 points and 8.4 rebounds in 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
Mill is the second offseason addition for the Pistons, who
signed free agent swingman Michell Curry to a five-year, $12
million deal.

WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- While Trinidad offered a
rematch after his less-than convincing majority decision Saturday
night, it appears highly unlikely the two sides would agree on

<P>
Oscar De La Hoya was guaranteed $15 million for the 12-round
welterweight championship bout to Trinidad's $10.5 million.

Trinidad's promoter, Don King, said a rematch can occur if the

I guess he answered the question. There will not be a rematch."
</P>

Arum believes De La Hoya still would attract attention despite
his first defeat in 32 bouts.

De La Hoya, 26, said it will be a long time before he enters

</P>
<P>
The financial sector's output contracted 33.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the expenditure side, household consumption rose 0.9 percent
year-on-year as Thais spent more on automobiles, electrical
apparatus, furniture and medicine though they were still cautious
on buying food and beverage.
</P>
<P>
Government consumption jumped 41.3 percent year-on-year largely
due to the government's fiscal expansion to stimulate the economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The number of people killed
in Sunday's blast in a longan processing factory in northern
Thailand has risen to 35, an informed source said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The huge explosion, which injured more than 100 others, also
destroyed and caused damage to a hospital, a school, a temple and
about 100 houses within a one-kilometer radius of the factory.
</P>
<P>
The blast was believed to have been caused by the large amount
of potassium chlorate illegally stored in the Taiwan-owned
factory, in the northern province of Chiang Mai.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the owner of the factory, Lee Hong Tien,
who is abroad at present, had telephoned the police to say he
would take full responsibility for the explosion and was willing
to pay for the damage caused.
</P>
<P>
Governor Pravit Sihapon of Chiang Mai estimated the damage to
the factory was at more than 300 million baht while damage to an
estimated 200 other buildings and private properties has yet to be
established.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police have charged Lee, a Thai managing director of
the factory and Pathan Trichat, who is responsible for the
administration of the plant, in connection with the explosion.
</P>

So far, Pathan has already been arrested while arrest warrants

<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Twenty years ago, it was a
common scene in Beijing to see thousands of people queuing along
the street in the chill of early winter, waiting for their turns
to buy cabbage.
</P>
<P>
Though that has become a thing of the past, the experience of
those "days of scarcity" under the old planned economic system
still haunts the memory of some old Beijing residents, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
During the period of planned economy and the early years of
transition to the market economy, people in Beijing, the capital,
had to store plenty of cabbage -- the only vegetable available for
them to tide over the winter months. And they must wait in long
lines to buy enough of it before frost sets in.
</P>
<P>
Wu Mingzhen, a Beijing resident, recalled her bitter memory of
those years. "There is still a cellar in my house. It was built by
my husband 15 years ago to store cabbage through winters."
</P>
<P>
At that time, a quota was imposed on the sale of cabbage, Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
Purchase of cabbages was almost a crucial contest among the
buyers because of the often inadequate supply. Then, one of the
city's vice-majors would be put in charge of the city's "special
cabbage sales commission" each year.
</P>
<P>
Finally, a project designed to change the situation was
launched in 1988 across China. It was called "Vegetable Basket
Project".
</P>
<P>
The program, initiated by the Ministry of Agriculture, was part
of the nation's agricultural and market reform, designed to
satisfy the growing demand for better food supply.
</P>
<P>
It encouraged farmers to increase the variety of vegetables
planted with a series of preferential policies serving as
incentives.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the agricultural departments this
year, the country's total annual yield of vegetables has risen 102
percent since 1988 to 313 million tons, and per capita output has
jumped three-fold since 1978 to 253 kilograms, turning China into
one of the world's leading vegetable producers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
Output value of China's vegetables hit 250 billion yuan (about
30 billion USD) last year. Total acreage had increased by 98
percent in the 1988-97 period. And vegetables have become the main
source of income for farmers after grain.
</P>
<P>
Since the inception of the project, thanks to the introduction
of markert-oriented economy, producers from the private sector
soon dominated local vegetable markets, driving public suppliers
to the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
During the early 1990s, people working in State-run factories
in some provinces were urged to join a so-called "patriotic
cabbage" drive and buy up the surplus cabbages from market, in
order to avoid wasting the over-supplied vegetable.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Clarifies East Timor Issue in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- At the invitation of the
House of Representatives, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Tuesday made clarification of the East Timor issue before the
parliament here.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said the August 30 direct ballot ending with the
victory of the anti-autonomy camp was mainly aimed at finding the
final solution to the East Timor question.
</P>
<P>
The head of state also touched on the background of the two
options offered to the East Timorese, wide-ranging autonomy or
separation from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He accused Australia of adopting an attitude which he said had
not been helpful in settling the East Timor question.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Australian sentiment has surged since the Indonesian
government agreed to accept foreign peacekeepers to quell the
violence in East Timor. Some Indonesians believe that Canberra,
which has been particularly critical of Jakarta's actions in East
Timor, has meddled in Indonesian affairs.
</P>
<P>
Some East Timorese and segments of Indonesian society have also
accused Australia of backing pro-independence factions, resulting
in an overwhelming rejection of Indonesia's offer of autonomy in
the August 30 vote.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Indonesia last Thursday canceled the security
agreement signed by the Indonesian and Australian governments on
December 18, 1995.

<HEADLINE> Asia Wealth Bank Opens 32nd Branch in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Wealth Bank (AWB)
opened a branch on Sunday in Dawei, southern Tanintharyi division,
bringing the total number of branches to 32 in the country, the
official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The AWB, one of the leading private banks in Myanmar and first
established with a capital of 60 million kyats (200,000 U.S.
dollars), had grown to 970 million kyats (3.23 million dollars)
and bank deposits amounted to 58 billion kyats (193.3 million
dollars) by July this year.
</P>
<P>
The bank had also given out loans totaling 26 billion kyats
(86.6 million dollars) by that time, according to sources at the
bank.
</P>
<P>
There are 19 private banks in Myanmar with the AWB, the Yoma
Bank and the Myanmar Mayflower Bank (MMB) leading in domestic
commercial banking services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the MMB also opened one more branch in the capital
of Yangon on Monday, bringing the total number of its branches to
12. The bank is also planning to extend services like call
deposits, gift check, credit card and safe deposit locker.
</P>
<P>
The private banks in Myanmar hold about 45 percent of savings
deposits of the banking sector while their loans account for about
48 percent of the sector's loans to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
In Myanmar, the annual bank interest rate is quite high for
local citizens. The rate has gone up to 16 percent from 12 percent
two years ago. However, there is no interest for people who keep
foreign currencies at Myanmar banks.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar started adopting the market-oriented economic policy in
late 1988 and reformed its banking system in 1990, allowing
private banks to operate again after they were nationalized in
1963.

party members who went to the party headquarters by Monday.
</P>
<P>
The party's legislators will cast their votes from 4 p.m.(local

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan met separately on Monday with his
counterparts from Ukraine, Italy, Albania, Greece, Croatia and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese official said that during the meetings, Tang Jiaxuan
pointed out the "new interventionism" of the so-called "human
rights over sovereignty", initiated by some countries, was
hegemonism in essence.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who is here to attend the general debate of the 54th
session of the United Nations General Assembly, said the "special
state to state relationship" theory by Lee Teng-Hui was an attempt
to deny the "one China" fact and was directed at separating Taiwan
from China.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Tang, all of the six foreign ministers said
their countries had attached great importance to developing
relations with China, and they reiterated that their countries
would continue to pursue the "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Tang Jiaxuan also met a delegation from the European
Union's (EU) Troika which was led by the Minister of Foreign
Affairs of Finland, Tarja Halonen.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Tang said China and the EU were the two
great forces in the world and China had always attached great
importance to developing relations with EU countries.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the establishment of a stable, constructive
partnership between China and the EU would benefit both sides.
</P>
<P>
Halonen said all the EU countries shared the view of further
developing relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Halonen said the EU countries supported china's bid for the

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 20 (Xinhua)-- Colombia's
paramilitary men have killed at least 14 people in the past two
days, according to reports reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Ramirez, mayor of Puerto Rico in the province of Meta,
said on Monday that seven local residents were killed by the

</P>
<P>
According to him, about 300 men of the paramilitary
organization took control of the place for two hours, during which
they brought together inhabitants at the main plaza of the inner
city and murdered four of them.
</P>
<P>
The other three bodies were found in the rural area, he added,
who feared more victims to be discovered.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, paramilitary men killed seven people in Debeiba,
Antioquia province.
</P>

These armed men threatened the inhabitants by executing those
who are guerrilla men or their sympathizers, the same as they have
done in other places in the south of the country, where they have
killed several farmers in recent months.
</P>

Moreover, a pastor of the Pentecostal Church was on Monday
alleged killed by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.

BRASILIA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's public accounts
obtained a surplus of 2.83 U.S. billion dollars in July, Brazil's
Central Bank (BCB) announced Monday.
</P>
<P>

One of the contributors to the surplus was the income of 598
million dollars related to payment for government concessions in
the area of public telephones, he said.

Accumulated primary surplus from January to July this year was
12.012 billion dollars, 3.63 percent of the GDP.

<P>
MANAGUA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Over 300 families have been
removed from places in western Nicaragua due to floods following
intense rains.
</P>
<P>
The residents affected are mainly in Chinandega and Posoltega
provinces, west of the country, the latest report from the Civil
Defense department said.
</P>
<P>
The great growth of streams has left 18 Tola communities
isolated in Rivas province, 80 kilometers south of Managua, where
15,000 families have been prevented from moving to other
localities due to lack of transport.
</P>
<P>
According to forecaster of Nicaragua's Institute of Territorial
Studies (INETER), Rafaela Nutrinda, the latest rains correspond to
an indirect affectation of hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
The official indicated that for the coming 24 hours, rains will

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 20 (Xinhua)-- The government of Chiapas
state, south of Mexico, Monday released 26 prisoners sympathizing
with rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN), the local
authorities announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The freeing of the alleged culprits is part of the government's
unilateral commitment in favor of restarting a dialog with the
EZLN, according to a communique issued in Tuxtla Gutierrez,
Chiapas' capital.
</P>
<P>
Last week, 67 people supporting the anti-government group were
released.
</P>
<P>
The EZLN canceled in 1996 its talks with the government after
accusing it of ignoring the San Andres peace accord singed by both
sides in the same year.
</P>
<P>
Interior Secretary Diodoro Carrasco announced a six-point plan
on September 7 to renew the stalled peace process with the EZLN.
The plan included freeing jailed rebels and creating a new body to
mediate in the conflict.

BUDAPEST, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Interior Minister
Pinter Sandor and his Jordanian counterpart Nayef Al-Kadi Monday
signed an agreement on fight against terrorism, drug-trafficking
and organized crimes.
</P>

crimes are increasingly threatening the public order and spreading
in spite of national boundaries, cultural and religious
differences.

Therefore the accord is of special significance to his country
since Jordan is one of the major targets of terrorists, Al-Kadi
said.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers agreed that cooperation in tourism and trade
should also be included in the agreement as tourists and investors

<HEADLINE> U.S.-owned Sears Canada to Buy Part of Retailing Company Eaton's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S.-owned Sears Canada is
trying to claim part of the insolvent Eaton's company by paying 50
million Canadian dollars (about 34 million U.S. dollars) for
creditors.
</P>
<P>
Sears Canada announced the offer Monday, saying it will also
take over Eaton's trademarks and eight of the dozens of Eaton's
remaining stores.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Eaton's brand has a long and valued position in
the marketplace," the Canadian media quoted Sears Canada Chief
Executive Paul Waters as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sears expects the deal to be signed by the end of this year
after the approval by courts, regulators, shareholders and
creditors, the media said.
</P>
<P>
Eaton's, the 130-year-old retailing icon of Canada, started
liquidation sales in late August as a result of years of poor
operations, in which Eaton's has lost more than 400 million
Canadian dollars (about 272 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> China Maps Out New Aerospace Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING,September 21 (Xinhua) -- The primary mission of China'
s aerospace industry is to provide in-orbit delivery and earth
station services, in addition to offering commercial satellite
launches, according to industry leaders.
</P>
<P>
Although a clear-cut program is still brewing, service
expansion will create intoxicating market opportunities for China,
said Zhang Xinxia, president of China Great Wall Industrial Corp.
(CGWIC), quoted by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The CGWIC, the sole enterprise authorized by the Chinese
government to provide commercial launch services, has carried out
23 commercial launches for overseas customers since China entered
the international satellite-launching market in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Launch services rendered by China account for 7-9 percent of
the world's commercial satellite launches market, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"The CGWIC will serve as an in-orbit delivery supplier, meaning
it will send China-made satellites atop Chinese carriers into the
preset orbits for overseas users, and provide after-launch
services," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
China has made sizable strides in honing its carrier-rocket
technology and in improving satellite monitoring and control
expertise in recent years, he said.
</P>
<P>
But to realize the goal of providing in-orbit delivery service,
the country has yet to sharpen the competitive edge of its
satellites, which lag behind foreign competitors in terms of
capabilities and quality, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Adapting itself to the needs of the international market, China
has developed a series of key technologies, such as cluster
technology and a technology to launch several satellites with one
rocket, said the CGWIC president.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Top 5,000 Firms in Good Shape Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Although they reported
relatively lower sales and profits, most of the Philippines' top
5,000 corporations managed to weather the Asian crisis last year,
Today newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a report of the Securities and Exchange
Commission as saying the number of losing corporations last year
grew only by 1.5 percent from 1,172 to 1,189, while that of
gaining ones fell less than 1 percent from 3,828 firms to 3,811.
</P>
<P>
The level of losses the companies suffered was more
substantial, however. Total losses posted by the corporations grew
28.6 percent from 81.5 billion pesos (2.04 billion U.S. dollars)
to 104.8 billion pesos (2.6 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
While the companies continued to grow in terms of sales, their
rate of growth was relatively slower than in the previous years,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Sales of the top corporations in 1998 reached 3.095 trillion
pesos (77.4 billion dollars), reflecting an 11.8-percent increase
over 2.768 trillion pesos (69.2 billion dollars) in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
But this was considerably lower compared with the 1997 sales
growth of 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
Though sales continued to grow, profitability was hit. Total
earnings of the corporations reached 142.5 billion pesos (3.56
billion dollars), a 6.7-percent drop from the 1997 figure of 152.7
billion pesos (3.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The rate of decline was benign, however, considering the rate
of reduction of 33 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Trees in Beijing Rejuvenate After Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 570 diseased
ancient trees inside the Beijing Working People's Palace of
Culture have rejuvenated after a one-month treatment.
</P>
<P>
The trees in the palace are about 300 years old, and some of
their trunks have split and decayed because of seeping rain water
and a lack of nutrients.
</P>
<P>
In October, experts began to treat the sick trees with
fertilizers, special nutritional elements, and pesticides.
</P>
<P>
They also cleaned out the dead wood in the trunks and stuffed
the tree trunks with cement and sand and bricks.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring the Forbidden City, the Beijing Working People's
Palace was a group of royal temples during the Ming (1368-1644)
and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. It boasts the largest grove of
ancient trees in China and is one of Beijing's tourist attractions.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian navy has paid 100,
000 U.S. dollars to an American captain to end a 16-month legal
dispute over collision.
</P>
<P>
Canadian navy spokesman Lt.-Cmdr. Glenn Glenn Chamberlain said
Monday the cash was paid to Don Howarth of Gloucester,
Massachusetts.

Canadian navy ship HMCS Glace Bay hit the port side of the 13-
metre lobster boat Matthew John owned by Howarth in January 1998
at the approaches to Boston harbor.

<P>
Canadian media said that Glace bay's commanding officer Lt.-
Cmdr Rober Thorpe was relieved of his post following the accident.

<P>
After months of disputes over the causes of the collision, a
board of inquiry in the country also concluded that "the greater
share of responsibility to avoid the collision lay with the Glace
Bay."

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Deputy's Proposals Accepted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Since early this month, people
of the Uygur and Kazak nationalities in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region have been able to hear live news broadcast
from China Central Television Station translated into Uygur and
Kazak languages.
</P>
<P>
The idea resulted from a proposal put forward by Abul'ahat
Mamut, a deputy to the Regional People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"I have raised 10 proposals concerning problems in various
fields since the first session of the Ninth Regional People's
Congress, and all of them have been solved. I am satisfied with
the outcome," said Abul'ahat Mamut.
</P>
<P>
Though the local television station began to translate Chinese-
language programs into Uygur in the 1970s and into Kazak in the
1980s, the ethnic language broadcasts were on a 25-hour delay.
</P>
<P>
The proposal quickly caught the attention of the regional
government. Xinjiang has invested 1.2 million yuan (about 145,000
U.S. dollars) to purchase new equipment and employ translators,
and the satellite channel of Xinjiang Television Station now airs
the daily news with just a 4-hour delay, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other proposals from people's deputies, such as ideas on
building a railway road in southern Xinjiang and keeping crude oil
and cotton as the region's pillar industries, have also been
implemented.

<HEADLINE> UEFA Rejects Foreign Player Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- European soccer governing body
UEFA said that it will not attempt to limit the number of foreign
players signed to European teams.
</P>
<P>
Sepp Blatter, president of the organization, had proposed that
a minimum of six home players should be fielded by teams, thereby
limiting the number of imported stars to five. Fifa had also taken
up the issue.
</P>
<P>
But UEFA's legal advisors have said that any attempt to limit
the free movement of footballers in Europe would clash with
European Union employment law and is therefore unworkable.
</P>
<P>
Alisdair Bell, who is advising the European football body, said:
"UEFA is always committed to advancing grass roots football, but
these foreigners are EU citizens and have a right to play in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way that such a change could be brought about
because you have to change the whole concept of employment law
within Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The only way that you could limit European players from
playing in other European countries is to say that footballers
were no longer workers and [no longer] have the same working
rights."
</P>
<P>
Several European countries' football federations have expressed
concern recently that imported players are preventing the
development of homegrown talent.
</P>
<P>
The issue provoked a players' strike in Spain and measures
limiting the number of overseas stars have now been introduced
there.
</P>
<P>
In addition, incoming European Commission president Romano
Prodi is facing pressure from clubs in his own country, Italy, to
address the issue.
</P>
<P>
But making the idea of foreign player limits acceptable in
terms of EU law will not be an easy task.
</P>
<P>
Footballers are classified as workers under European
legislation and are entitled to the same rights and freedom of
movement within the European workplace - a legal grounding
enshrined in the so-called Bosman ruling.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, Bell said: "A report will be put together and the
plan would be then to put pressure on the European commissioners
to have a look carefully at everything surrounding this ruling."

<HEADLINE> Elliott Says Sorry to Owen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League soccer
club Leicester skipper Matt Elliott apologized to Michael Owen
over the challenge which floored the striker in the Premiership
clash with Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
Elliott could face a Football Association charge with match
referee Uriah Rennie having been asked to look again at the video
after taking no action at the time against the central defender.
</P>
<P>
The Scotland international appeared to cut across Owen and
strike him in the face with his elbow. Liverpool boss Gerard
Houllier said the 19-year-old was still dizzy after the game at
Filbert Street.
</P>
<P>
Several pundits, including Match Of The Day's Alan Hansen, felt
the defender should have been shown the red card.
</P>
<P>
But Elliott insisted there had been no malicious intent -
however bad the incident might look in television replays - and he
even was given Owen's shirt after the match.
</P>
<P>
Elliott told Press Association: "At the time I did not think
too much of what had happened. I came across to challenge Michael
Owen and he was a bit too quick for me. I thought I had barged him
more than anything else.
</P>
<P>
"I had still apologized to him after the game, he showed no
resentment and I asked him for his shirt. I collect shirts of all
the top strikers and he was pretty forthcoming with that.
</P>
<P>
"It was only when I watched Match Of The Day on Saturday
evening that I was taken aback with what I saw. I must admit that
it did not look too good.
</P>
<P>
"I apologize again now to Michael. I am more than willing to do
that but I am being honest when I say there was no malicious
intent on my part.
</P>
<P>
"I am not that sort of player and don't want to be labeled as
that sort of player."

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen Monday said that his country will support "the
need for reforming the United Nations" in recruit competent staff
for posting in various U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the General Assembly, Hun Sen said, "The United
Nations and its specialized organs need to become more unified at
the country level under the mechanism of the U.N. Resident
Coordinator."
</P>
<P>
""With this reform, our world body will be required to improve
the criteria to recruit staff and personalities for posting in
various U.N. agencies, especially for posting in member
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, they will consider themselves almighty Gods without
any virtue and are ready to violate the sovereignty of a member
country, which has paid considerable membership due to pay for
their high salaries," he said. "In this regard, Cambodia has had
some experiences in the history of its cooperation with some of
the U.N. offices."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that "some challenges remain including
further efforts to curtail the burgeoning budget levels."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations has served us well in the last over half a
century," he said. "It has done commendable work beyond its
original mandate and has adapted to changing needs."
</P>
<P>
He also praised U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his role
in ensuring that "much has been accomplished under the bold and
visionary leadership."

<HEADLINE> L.America's Data Network Services Markets Undergo  Rapid Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Latin America's data
networks services markets are undergoing rapid growth due to the
liberalization and privatization trends in the region's
telecommunications sectors.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released Monday by U.S. market research
firm International Data Corporation (IDC), 1998 revenues for the
region's top six country markets closed in on 2.7 billion U.S.
dollars. The number of lines/ports exceeded 425,000 last year, and
the number is expected to more than double to 980,000 by 2003.
</P>
<P>
IDC examined market in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia,
Mexico and Venezuela. Brazil holds the majority of the market's
ports and lines with 42 percent as well as the largest share of
revenues, IDC said. Mexico is a distant second with 25 percent of
all ports and leased lines but an even smaller share of total
revenues.
</P>
<P>
With almost 2 billion U.S. dollars in revenues for 1998, IDC
said, leased lines accounted for 71 percent of revenues. Still an
important part of the Latin America data services revenues, X.25
services were in second place with 16 percent for the top six
country markets. Frame relay services are growing at a rapid pace
in the region, but this segment of the markets was still only in
third place in terms of its share of total revenues. In the
future, the most rapid growth is expected from automatic teller
machine (ATM) and frame relay services, according to IDC.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Greater Labor Flexibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government Monday
called for greater labor flexibility to further the fight against
joblessness.
</P>
<P>
The government also confirmed that half the projects written
into the national Social Pact signed in December last year to spur
economic growth and job creation have been brought on stream.
</P>
<P>
An update on progress on the Social Pact, signed on December 22
by the government, business and industry and the trade union
confederations, was provided by Italian Treasury Minister Giuliano
Amato during a check-up on the measures at Cnel, the National
Council for the Economy and Labor.
</P>
<P>
At the same session led by Premier Massimo D'Alema, with
representatives of the signatories in attendance, Amato said 131
of the 239 projects have been started up and of the 76 with a
deadline of August 31, 64 have been implemented, 84 percent of
them.
</P>
<P>
On the sensitive issue of labor flexibility, Italian Labor
Minister Cesare Salvi said that what the government means by the
term is a "high way" which will make "rigidity" in the past to
remove obstacles to job creation. He ruled out the idea that the
government would allow jobs to become "precarious" or aim "only at
reducing salaries and guarantees."
</P>
<P>
"The request to reduce wages and guarantees to regain
competitive advantages from these sources does not fit into a
modern direction for policy," the minister affirmed.
</P>
<P>
On a related issue, illegal or "black labor," Salvi admitted
difficulties and called for tighter coordination among business
and industry and the unions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same issue, D'Alema said that the government
has introduced labor flexibility such as part-time work and term
contracts.
</P>
<P>
He said that 523,000 jobs have been created in the past three
years and a decline in unemployment is being seen for the first
time.

MEXICO CITY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Mexico promised to keep
accords with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
Energy Secretary Luis Tellez Kuenzler said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government will set forth its stance as observer

</P>
<P>
Prices have doubled this year after OPEC and several main
independent oil producers reduced world supply about 6 percent
starting in April.
</P>
<P>
"We've talked with OPEC members and what we hope for is the cut
back to be kept until March 31 of the coming year," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
The fall of oil prices forced the Mexican government in 1998 to
cut back its expenses due to exports of crude and by-products
represented 25 percent of fiscal incomes in the country.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Is Sure to See No War in Congo (K) Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- South African
President Thabo Mbeki Monday voiced his confidence that the war
will not resume in the Democratic Republic of Congo, because all
warring parties have signed a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The South African president told a press conference here that
"I am sure that the war will not begin again. Nobody wants war
there."
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has signed the (ceasefire) agreement, which commits
them to peace," he said. "I am quite certain that there is not
going to be a collapse in that process" to bring peace into Congo
(K).
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the president has delivered his first
speech at the General Assembly general debate, which began Monday,
since he succeeded President Nelson Mandela earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to move to implement what was agreed to save
the course," he said.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia have all sent troops to back
Congolese President Laurent Kabila, while Rwanda and Uganda
supported rebel groups trying to topple Kabila. A peace deal
signed in the Zambian Capital of Lusaka came into effect on
September 1.
</P>
<P>
Once security clearances from all the governments and rebel
groups were assured, the United Nations military team would
proceed to the war zone.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven officers from 13 countries make up the U.N.'s
advance of a 90-man force called the U.N. Observer Mission in
Congo (MONUC), which has a 90-day mandate under a Security Council
resolution.
</P>
<P>
On the Angolan issue, he said that the 14-nation Southern
African Development Community (SADC) held a summit in August,
during which the Angolan issue was discussed. All participating
leaders decided to mount humanitarian assistance to Angola.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations should continue to pursue" the peace in
the southwestern African country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations suffered from a failure in its peacekeeping
operation in Angola by withdrawing the peacekeepers from the
African country in February this month, and the humanitarian
situation is worsening in the nation.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations' anti-crime
and drugs chief Pino Arlacchi Monday warned of the rise of new
forms of slavery and international trafficking in prostitutes at a
symposium organized by the Italian Equal Opportunities Minister
Laura Balbo.
</P>
<P>
Arlacchi said the world was beginning to face up to the problem
while Balbo stressed that Italy had already taken action against
the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
"In south-east Asia alone," Arlacchi told the conference, "30
million women are turned into slaves for prostitution."
</P>
<P>
The worldwide value of the trade is worth between 7 and 12
billion dollars a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for Italy, UN figures cite 30-35,000 people, mostly foreign
women, forced into prostitution.
</P>
<P>
Some of the Italian leading prosecutors present came out in
favor of applying tough anti-Mafia laws against the mainly
Albanian gangs that bring women into Italy and force them to work
as prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
Before moving to the UN as deputy secretary-general and leader
of the fight against international crime, Arlacchi was considered
Italy's leading expert on the Mafia.

<HEADLINE> Algerian President Refutes Outside Interference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President
Abdelaziz Bouteflika Monday rejected outside interference in the
internal affairs of sovereign countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 54th session of the United Nations General
Assembly, the president said, "In any case, we firmly believe that
interference in internal affairs can only take place with the
consent of the state in question."
</P>
<P>
"Sovereignty is our final defense against the rules of an
unequal world," said Bouteflika, who represents the Organization
of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
"We do not deny the right of Northern Hemisphere public opinion
to denounce the breaches of human rights where they exist.
Furthermore, we do not deny that the United Nations has the right
and the duty to help suffering humanity. But we remain extremely
sensitive to any undermining of our sovereignty," the president
added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the context of each state, its traditions, social
structure and priority must be taken into account when talking
about human rights. "Every human being has the right to a decent
and dignified life," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president complained that the African countries have had
little say in the decision-making process by the Security Council
and in monitoring the implementation of its resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika delivered the speech shortly after U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged the international community to
redefine sovereignty and national interest, allowing prompt
humanitarian intervention in case of crisis anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that globalization and international
cooperation have made the redefinition necessary to meet the
challenges facing the world in the new century.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian president believed that the hotbeds of tension and
crisis must be extinguished. The suffering of peoples as yet
unable to exercise their right to self-determination and
independence must end. The embargo imposed on the Iraqi people
should find its solution in a "less harmful" way.
</P>
<P>
He called on the industrialized countries to do their part to
help the poor countries develop their economy, eradicate poverty
and share with them the tremendous benefits from globalization.
</P>
<P>
It was discouraging to see an ever-widening gap between the
rich and poor in the current world characterized by the triumphant
force of some and the disconcerting fragility and vulnerability of
others, he said.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the least-advanced countries, three quarters of
the countries with insufficient revenues are in Africa, where
nearly 50 percent of the total population are living in the most
abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
The president believed that despite the changes in the world
politics since the end of the cold war, the movement towards
pluralism and the market economy should be encouraged and
accompanied by a movement towards solidarity based on fair and
equitable relationships and shared prosperity.

UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen said here Monday that his country will continue
to pursue "market-oriented" policies for economic growth and "our
main and foremost goal is poverty alleviation."
</P>

The prime minister, in his speech to the General Assembly,
said, "On the economic front, we have pursued and will continue
with `market-oriented' policies with safety nets for the
vulnerable sections till they are able to compete equally well
with others."
</P>
<P>
"Our main and foremost goal is poverty alleviation," he said.
"Our economic policies and practices, with generous external
assistance for which we are grateful, have resulted in steady
growth in the past few years."
</P>
<P>
"Even during the period of the financial melt-down in the
region two years ago, Cambodian economy maintained a fairly even
keel," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, with strong political will the Royal Government is
implementing its policy platform and reform programs with a view
to establishing a viable foundation for long-term economic growth
and sustainable development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The key areas of the reform programs include military and
police demobilization, public sector reform aimed at strengthening
democracy, improving and increasing the efficiency of the public
services, enhancing the rule of law and the respect for human
rights," he said, "as well as economic reform, focusing on
maintaining macroeconomic stability, strengthening the banking and
financial institutions, fiscal reform measures, ensuring a sound
management of public property and increasing public investment in
the area of physical and social infrastructure and human resource
development."
</P>
<P>
"Just in the past year, Cambodia has finally turned a corner
of history, putting firmly behind the darkness of its recent
history and emerging into a new dawn of its future," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined and confident that Cambodia will march ahead
into the next century and millennium with renewed confidence and
vigor and to contribute to human progress," he said.
