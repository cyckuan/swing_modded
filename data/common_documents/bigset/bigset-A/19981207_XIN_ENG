<P>
MOSCOW, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice-Premier Tariq Aziz
arrived here on Sunday on a four-day working visit, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Aziz's visit to Moscow is made "in the framework of Russia's
efforts to settle the situation around Iraq," Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister and the Russian president's special
representative for Middle East Viktor Posuvalyuk was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the Iraqi vice-premier is expected to meet
with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and then with Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Monday.

<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, one of the main goals
of the visit is to discuss how to settle the crisis over Iraq.

<P>
Russia is expected to urge Baghdad to strictly abide by all
Security Council resolutions and resume full cooperation with the
U.N. special commission on Iraq's disarmament, the Interfax said.

lifting of the sanctions, imposed by the international community
on Iraq seven years ago, sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry

<P>
He thought that a considerable part of the U.N. commission's
work had been completed.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Ready to Cooperate with Iraq in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister
Youssef Wali said Sunday that his country is keen on offering
agricultural expertise and research results to Iraq and other Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
Wali, who is also the minister of agriculture and land
reclamation, made the remarks when meeting Iraqi Trade Minister
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Wali underlined the importance of increasing agricultural trade
volume in the Arab world in view of the international economic
changes.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Wali and Saleh discussed ways of enhancing
bilateral agricultural cooperation, especially in land reclamation
and trade, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Saleh spoke highly of the quality of Egypt's agricultural
goods, hoping more trade.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's exports to Iraq reached 238 million U.S. dollars in the
first eight months of this year, leading other Arab countries in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
Saleh, who arrived here Thursday, is holding talks with
Egyptian officials on expanding bilateral cooperation and
increasing Egypt's exports to Iraq under the U.N. oil-for-food
program, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The program allows Iraq, which is under the U.N. trade embargo,
to sell a limited amount of oil to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
During Saleh's visit, the two countries will sign a number of
contracts, under which Iraq will import from Egypt steel, cement
and other building materials.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Official: U.S. Seeking Control Over Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States is seeking to
impose control over the Arab Nation, warned Iraqi Vice President
Taha Yassin Ramadhan on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ramadhan made the remarks when meeting with a delegation of
the International Federation of Arab Workers Unions headed by the
federation's Secretary Hassan Jammam, the Iraqi News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Ramadhan appreciated the prominent role the
federation played in supporting Iraq's steadfastness and struggle
against "the foes' hostile schemes," said the agency report.
</P>
<P>
Ramadhan said that Arab workers stood in the forefront of the
educated section facing the U.S. arrogance.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leader called for backing to the Arab economy,
improving the workers' occupation and facilitating their travel
among the Arab countries, saying that these requirements would be
accomplished just when the Nation would have free economy.
</P>
<P>
He underscored that Iraq, after eight years of U.N. trade
embargo, managed to bypass the weakness in achieving a set of
projects and now the enemies' hidden targets have been revealed.
</P>
<P>
Ramadhan was referring to a statement made by the U.S.
President Bill Clinton in mid-November in which Clinton openly
said that America would support the Iraqi opposition to topple
the current Iraqi government led by President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Jammam expressed the Arab workers' solidarity
with the people of Iraq, stressing that the federation had
reiterated its support for Iraq through the mass media and
conferences.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), on
Sunday strongly urged factions concerned in the Anjouan conflict
"to immediately put an end to these senseless fightings."
</P>
<P>
According to an OAU press communique issued here, Salim said
in a statement on the situation prevailing in the Comorian Island
of Anjouan that he is "greatly concerned with the unfolding
developments in Anjouan and the loss of lives and other
casualties as a result of fightings which erupted between
factions in the Island".
</P>
<P>
"These developments are all the more unfortunate as they occur
at a time when there were signs of hope for the convening of the
Comorian Inter-Islands Conference," he said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief noted that senseless fightings "can only bring
about further suffering and destruction," and urged factions
concerned to "seize the opportunity of the envisaged Comorian
Inter-Islands Conference to peacefully address the problems
facing the Comorian Islands and their people."
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief also appealed to member states, especially the
countries of the region to consider possibilities of extending
the necessary assistance to contribute toward an early return of
normalcy in the Indian Ocean island and the restoration of peace,
security and stability in the Island.

<HEADLINE> Decision On Russian Missile Still Valid: Clerides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' President Glafcos
Clerides Sunday stressed that the decision to deploy the Russian
S-300 anti-aircraft missile is still valid, as well as the
preconditions to postpone their arrival.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at an anti-occupation gathering, Clerides said
he firmly believed that the strategy of Cypriot government on
defense and accession to European Union was correct.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the strategy was altered, the Cyprus problem
would plunge back to a prolonged stalemate.
</P>
<P>
The preconditions, he said "are either start of substantial
negotiations with prospects to achieve progress regarding the
substance of the Cyprus problem or substantial progress on
security issues, with the prospect of completing an agreement for
the gradual but eventual, complete demilitarization of Cyprus".
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the issue of defense has taken significant
dimensions in the past few years with the implementation of the
joint defense pact with Greece, adding that Cyprus is to continue
to strengthen its defense.
</P>
<P>
The President reassured that the aim of the Cypriot government
is "to first, find through peaceful means, a solution to the
Cyprus problem which will be fair, viable and for the benefit of
all Cypriots, and secondly, Cyprus' accession to the European
Union".
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in 1974
following a failed pro-Athens coup. U.N. led efforts to reunite
Cyprus have so far yielded no results.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy S-300
anti-aircraft missiles in a bid to booster its defense, a move
rejected by Turkey which has threatened to launch preemptive
strike on the missiles if they are deployed.

ADDIS ABABA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Health Minister
Adem Ibrahim Sunday called for national concerted efforts against
malaria in the Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
The health minister urged administrative bodies, health
institutions, governmental and non-governmental organizations and
the public to exert integrated effort to contain malaria epidemic
afflicting various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted Adem as saying that more than
70 percent of the total area of Ethiopia is suitable for mosquito
breeding.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the epidemic has worsened especially this
year due to climatic change, and failure to clear marshy areas
and spray them with anti-mosquito chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Adem stressed the need to create viable information network in
order to take strong actions against the disease.
</P>
<P>
Previous efforts to curb the pandemic went futile owing to lax
and unorganized control mechanisms, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, malaria has been rampant in
some areas of the country since this year's big rainy season
(June-October).

<HEADLINE> Levy's Refusal Deals Blow to Netanyahu Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy Sunday refused to rejoin the cabinet, an
apparent blow to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's effort to
broaden his coalition.
</P>
<P>
Levy told Israel Radio that the negotiations over the return of
his Gesher party to the coalition have led to nowhere, charging
that the prime minister was not serious with the negotiations from
the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
It's not clear at this moment whether this was his final
decision or just a posturing in the bargaining with Netanyahu
during the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Some Likud members believe that Levy's statement is just his
last attempt to gain more concessions from the prime minister
before he agreed to rejoin the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported Sunday that by the weekend the two
sides had reached a draft agreement in which Netanyahu accepted
Levy's demand that he pick up the position of finance minister,
rather than infrastructure minister as the prime minister had
offered.
</P>
<P>
The two also agreed that several hundreds of Gesher members
will join the central committee of the Likud, a move which has
been opposed by many Likud members, including some cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
But they were reportedly disputing over the national budget
for next year. Levy has insisted that the budget be changed
to allot more money to low-income Israelis, the core constituency
of the Gesher party.
</P>
<P>
He resigned in January also over the disputes on the national
budget for this year.
</P>
<P>
Since all five Gesher legislators quitted the coalition at
the same time, Netanyahu's government has had to cling to
power only by a 61-59 majority in the 120-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
By signing the land-for-peace deal with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on October 23, Netanyahu faced rebellions from his
hard-line coalition partners, who vehemently opposed the land
cession to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
To avoid being forced into early elections, Netanyahu has tried
to broaden his support base by wooing Levy and his party back.
</P>
<P>
But local analysts have pointed out that even the Gesher party
returns to the coalition, it could not put Netanyahu on a solid
foundation. Of the five Gesher legislators, two have quitted the
party and joined other opposition camps.
</P>
<P>
Many observers say that Netanyahu might be at last forced to
turn to the major opposition the Labor Party to form a national
unity government, when his last ditch efforts fail to keep a clear
majority in the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zambia Takes Steps to Curb Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 6 (Xinhua) --The Zambian government has waged
a fight against the escalating crimes and called on all Zambians
to fully cooperate with it.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Information and Broadcasting Minister, Newstead Zimba,
said here Sunday that the government has made the determination to
curb the rampant crimes and steps have been taken for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
The measures include tight scrutiny of people getting national
registration cards, keeping all refugees coming from neighboring
countries in designated areas, and the identification, arrest and
deportation of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Others will be to enhance police training, introduce more
radio and television programs on community-based policing on
crime, promote neighborhood watch schemes and to urge the public
to cooperate with the police in identifying criminals.
</P>
<P>
And the police have been given the mandate to recruit more
officers in the fight against the sophisticated criminals,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
While briefing the press, Zimba, who is also chief government
spokesman, declared that the government takes full control of the
deteriorated crime situation in the country and that a number of
criminals have been identified and are being brought to book.
</P>
<P>
Loopholes through which crimes have been perpetrated are being
sealed, Zimba said, adding that high crime areas will be
subjected to high police presence.
</P>
<P>
He emphasised the need for all citizens to form neighborhood
watch groups that have been instrumental in combating crimes.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Home Affairs Minister Katele Kalumba declared a
war on criminals and warned that the country was at serious risk
of being over-run by criminals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a bid to curb the crime wave, the Zambian
government last month offered a seven-day amnesty for people with
illegal firearms to surrender them to the police.
</P>
<P>
According to a Times of Zambia report, there are about 68,000
private guns in this landlocked African country with a comparatively
small population of 9.5 million.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has been experiencing in the past months more and more
aggravated robberies, murders and other serious crimes. The most
bizarre can be the killing of former finance minister Ronald
Penza in cold blood at his residence in early November.
</P>
<P>
The criminals, who used to be armed with knives, pangas, iron
bars or similar weapons and raided a house to steal some
property, now have evolved into organized crime groups.
</P>
<P>
They use modern military firearms and transport vehicles to
rob banks, snatch cars and loot filling stations in groups and in
broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of Lusaka and the Copperbelt have been
identified as the most targeted areas.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here attributed the rampant crimes to the
bad economy which has been aggravated by lower employment, high
inflation, low or even negative gross national growth and rapid
devaluation of the local currency Kwacha.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Tighten Regulation on Foreign Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian government will carry
out spot checks next week among foreign workers to intensify its
regulation over foreign labor market.
</P>
<P>
The spot checks is part of a campaign, launched last September,
to force illegal foreign workers to rectify their status, the
semi-official Jordan Times quoted an unnamed official as saying
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Police and Labor Ministry officials will launch a nationwide
campaign against foreign laborers working as gas station
attendants, mechanics, guards and messengers," the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to Labor Ministry figures, 110,000 illegal foreign
workers have rectified their status by obtaining valid work
permits since last September.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is also designed to return job opportunities to the
Jordanians, who are facing an unemployment rate of 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are 300,000 to 500,000 foreign workers in Jordan, most of
them without valid work permits.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that they have grabbed job opportunities
from the Jordanians by asking for less payments.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, those foreign workers who are found
without valid work permits will face the danger of being fined
heavily or deported.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Bank Directors Sacked for Mismanagement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Uganda has
intervened in the management of Greenland Bank and removed the
managing director and the board of directors for their improper
management of the commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Sunday by the Bank of Uganda (central bank)
said: " This measure has become necessary because, under the
present management, the commercial bank was conducting its
business in violation of the Financial Institutions Statute."
</P>
<P>
The continuation of this situation would have been detrimental
to the interests of its depositors, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
To further strengthen the financial condition and management
of Greenland Bank, the central bank has decided to take with
immediate effect the measures such as appointing new managing
director and board of directors and reducing operation hours.
</P>
<P>
Fazil Kasujja has been appointed Acting Managing Director of
the commercial bank and a new board will be appointed in
consultation with the shareholders.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the central bank will do everything
necessary to ensure that the bank continues to operate normally
and in accordance with the law and related regulations.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, President Yoweri Museveni's brother Salim Saleh
admitted under press pressure that he had used the Greenland Bank
to pay for the 51 percent shares of a Malaysian company in the
Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB).
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian company bought the shares in the UCB and
secretly transferred its shares to Saleh, the president's
security adviser and a major general.
</P>
<P>
Saleh had reportedly denied any involvement in the deal, even
before Parliament, before making a surprising admission in a
three-page statement.

United Nations resolutions and with what it has agreed upon, a

standoff between Iraq and the U.N., the British general said "No,
I'm here to see the British forces. They would not be here if
Iraq was complying."
</P>
<P>
During the recent Iraqi-U.N. standoff over weapons inspections,
Britain sided firmly with the United States in using force to
press the Iraqi regime to back down from its non-cooperation with
the U.N. special commission (UNSCOM) in charge of disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On the outcome of his visit, Guthrie said his talks with
Kuwaiti government officials were "very meaningful and good."
</P>
<P>
"We discussed future plans, our position here and attitudes
towards the peoples of the region," he said. But he didn't
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Guthrie is expected to leave here later Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Clashes Continue in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Clashes between Palestinian
protesters and Israeli troops in the West Bank continued Sunday,
wounding at least two Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The clashes took place outside the Jewish settlement of Ariel
in northern West Bank when Palestinian demonstrators threw stones
at Israeli soldiers, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas in
response.
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, 27 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers were
wounded in similar clashes throughout the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The clashes stemmed from an increasingly bitter row over
Palestinian prisoners to be released under the Wye agreement
signed October 23.
</P>
<P>
Under the Palestinian-Israeli interim agreement, Israel will
pull out its troops from another 13 percent of the West Bank while
freeing 750 Palestinian prisoners by the end of January, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Israel has released 250 of them last months, but most were
criminals instead of political prisoners demanded by the Palestinian
side.
</P>
<P>
A report of Jerusalem Media and Communication Center said that
the Palestinian demonstrators set up protest tents in Gaza and
held hunger strike Sunday in support of the Palestinian prisoners
in Israeli jails, who began a hunger strike Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of State of Prisoners Affairs Hisham
Abdul Raziq blamed Israel for the escalating clashes in the West
Bank, saying that the Israeli government failed to implement the
signed agreement accordingly.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated on
Sunday that he will not free those involved in attacks leading to
death or injury of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
He also demanded the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) stop
encouraging violent protests and clamp down on them instead.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced last Thursday to hold up the implementation of
the Wye agreement until the PNA made concessions over the prisoner
issue.
</P>
<P>
The latest woes came only six days before the U.S. President
Bill Clinton is scheduled to begin a three-day visit to Israel and
the Palestinian self-rule area to push forward the implementation of
the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Mideast peace envoy, Dennis Ross, will arrive here
Tuesday to mediate between Israel and the Palestinians over the
prisoner issue to prepare for the arrival of Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Crown Prince Meets With Texaco Chief on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian Crown Prince
and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz met in Riyadh
Sunday with U.S. oil giant Texaco Inc's Chief Executive Peter
Bijur on cooperation in exploring and developing the Kingdom's gas
fields.
</P>
<P>
The meeting centered on "primary offers for cooperation between
Texaco and Saudi Arabia on the exploration and investment in gas
fields," the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said the ideas on cooperation were discussed in
a way that goes in line with the Saudi policy on exploring and
investing in the gas production and distribution aimed at
generating feasible income that supports overall returns.
</P>
<P>
Saudi gas reserves are estimated at 5 trillion cubic meters,
the fifth largest global gas reserve.
</P>
<P>
Peter Bijur, who arrived in Riyadh Saturday, has come to
present his company's proposals for joint ventures to develop
the Gulf Kingdom's energy sector.
</P>
<P>
The Texaco chief's trip marks the first high-profile visit by a
leading U.S. oilman to Saudi Arabia in response to Prince
Abdullah's request for ideas on developing his country's energy
industry in a meeting with top U.S. oil executives in Washington
in September.
</P>
<P>
The rare meeting has prompted speculation that Saudi Arabia,
the world largest oil producer, could create openings in its most
treasured upstream energy industry.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports reaching here said that oil industry insiders
had said Saudi Arabia has no intention of granting foreign
companies any form of ownership in its prized upstream oil and gas
sectors.
</P>
<P>
But a Saudi oil official said Thursday that the Kingdom was
ready to consider proposals on upstream gas ventures. That
was the first clear sign that Riyadh was prepared to show
flexibility towards the upstream gas offers.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian warplane serving with
the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG in Sierra Leone has
crashed at its base near the capital Freetown, an ECOMOG
statement said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A report from Freetown quoted the ECOMOG statement as saying
that the plane developed a technical fault on its approach run
and crashed at the Lungi International Airport Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The pilot ejected and was unhurt, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The accident occurred... when the Alfa Jet was returning from
a routine mission after developing a technical fault on the final
approach to landing," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, ECOMOG has at least four Alpha Jet
ground support planes in Sierra Leone, which are used to attack
rebel positions.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG was sent into Sierra Leone soon after
the May 1997 coup which overthrew elected President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG forces expelled the military junta emerging after the
coup from Freetown and restored the Kabbah government in March
1998, but forces loyal to the junta are still active in the north
and east parts of the tiny west African country.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leaders for Better Ties With Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian leaders have sent
letters to their counterparts of Saudi Arabia, calling for better
relations between the two Islamic giants in the region.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister of Saudi Arabia Prince Nayef Ibn Abdul-Aziz
received Sunday a message from his Iranian counterpart Abdulwahed
Lari concerning bilateral security relations.
</P>
<P>
The letter was conveyed by Iranian ambassador in Riyadh
Mohammad Riza Nouri during a meeting with Nayef, the Saudi Press
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This message came within the context of bilateral relations
that cover political, economic, commercial, and technical spheres,
the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The message came just one day after Saudi Crown Prince and
Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz received a message
from Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian ambassador, who conveyed the letter, said Khatami
wished to discuss with Prince Abdullah means of developing
bilateral relations in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Saudi Arabia, once in mistrust to each other for
almost two decades, began to improve their ties since President
Khatami, a political moderate, took office in August last year.
</P>
<P>
The two countries saw a big boost since last February
when Iran's former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani paid
a 14-day official visit to Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
Hence, the two sides have exchanged a number of other
high-level visits, during which talks on ways of boosting
bilateral ties and shoring up the sagging oil prices were held.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Accepts Presidential Advisor's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni Sunday accepted the resignation of his brother, Salim
Saleh from the office of senior presidential advisor on defense
and security.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the President's Office said Saleh
tendered his resignation on Sunday following his Saturday
admission of impropriety in the privatization and sale of the
Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB).
</P>
<P>
In his resignation, Saleh regretted having failed to live up
to the standards expected of him as a leading cadre of the ruling
National Resistance Movement and having failed to perform duties
as a senior presidential advisor which required him to exercise
good judgement in the service of the President and of the Ugandan
people.
</P>
<P>
He said his methods in acquiring the UCB were improper and not
in line with revolutionary conduct.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said that he took personal responsibility for all his
actions and was resigning in order to enable the president to
fight improper conduct such as his and to restore the hope for
the people of Uganda in the ideals of the ruling movement.
</P>
<P>
Accepting Saleh's resignation with regret, Museveni said the
resignation was a curtain raiser in the struggle to rectify
serious mistakes and indiscipline which have been creeping into
the Movement.
</P>
<P>
He said a corrupt Movement coupled with a corrupt public
service would be disastrous for the country's recovery.
</P>
<P>
Those like Saleh, who are largely indisciplined and who do not
follow central guidance, cause problems for the Movement even if
well intentioned, the press release quoted the president as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Saleh used to be the Overseer of Defense Ministry before
taking his post as senior presidential advisor on defense and
security. He is one of few generals who contributed much to the
coming to power of the Movement.
</P>
<P>
In a three-page statement issued Saturday, Saleh admitted,
after several months of denial, that he secretly used Greenland
Bank to pay for the transference of 49 percent shares of a
Malaysian company in the UCB.

<HEADLINE> Arab League, U.N. Chiefs to Meet on Lockerbie Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the Arab League Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said on Sunday that he would meet with U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan on the Lockerbie issue Monday in Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Abdel-Meguid
said that he would touch on the outcome of Annan's latest visit to
Libya, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting will be held on the sidelines of a summit
of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which comprises six Arab
countries of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the
UAE.
</P>
<P>
Both Abdel-Meguid and Annan have been invited to attend the
three-day annual summit due to open on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Annan held talks Saturday with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on
the Lockerbie crisis during a brief visit to the north African
nation which has been under U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Annan reportedly said he had fruitful and positive talks with
Gaddafi, adding that two Libyans suspected of blowing up a Pan Am
flight will be tried in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid termed Annan's visit to Libya as a positive step
towards settling the Lockerbie crisis.
</P>
<P>
But official reports, Libya disputed Annan's comment, saying
that the U.N. chief and Gaddafi did not discuss the Lockerbie
issue in their meeting.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said that he will try to unveil the reality in his
upcoming meeting with Annan.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have accused two Libyan citizens
of bombing the Pan Am 103 flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
1988, which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
The two countries succeeded in pressing the U.N. Security
Council to approve an air and arms embargo against Libya in 1992
for refusing to hand over to either of them the two suspects for
trial.
</P>
<P>
A compromise has been reached between the two western allies
and Libya that the two Libyans will be tried in the Netherlands,
as a neutral venue, by Scottish judges under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Libya, meanwhile, is seeking guarantees that the suspects will
not be extradited to the U.S. and wants them to be imprisoned in
Libya if convicted.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League, of which Libya is a member, supports this
stance.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Vows to Control AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
Sunday pledged to fight against AIDS which has claimed tens of
thousands of lives in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the first Multi-Sectoral AIDS Conference in
Arusha town in north Tanzania, Tanzanian Vice-President Omar Ali
Juma said in a written speech that any effort to combat AIDS will
win the government's unflinching support.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president, whose speech was read on his behalf by
Deputy Minister of Health Tatu Ntimizi, said that people know of
the devastating effect of AIDS, yet the recorded cases have kept
on increasing.
</P>
<P>
The recorded AIDS cases in Tanzania rose from 44,194 in 1991
to 60,066 in 1992, a rise of almost 20,000 in just a year, he
said, noting that actual number of cases is not known in the
country because many patients do not go to hospital.
</P>
<P>
However, he said available statistics showed that since the
first AIDS case was reported in 1983, about 103,185 Tanzanians
had sought medical care although the number of AIDS cases is
believed to be around 520,000.
</P>
<P>
He noted with happiness that the epidemic is on decline in
Kagera Region in the northwest because of co-ordinated efforts.
</P>
<P>
"This is clear evidence that prevention works and we need to
make it happen in other parts of Tanzania as well," said the
vice-president.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, Juma said that AIDS has
immeasurable impact on the economy due to loss in labor.
</P>
<P>
He noted that more than 86 percent of men infected with AIDS
are in the 20-29 age group while 87 percent of infected women are
aged between 15 and 44.
</P>
<P>
Juma also painted a bleak picture for children orphaned by
adults who died of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the steering committee of the conference,
Fred Mhalu, said that the gathering is an attempt to
bring together all concerned Tanzanians and their international
partners to determine why Tanzania has not been able to make
significant progress in controlling AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Mbalu said the conference is also intended to launch a
Tanzania AIDS society which aims at uniting all AIDS scientists,
researchers and experts in the control and prevention of the
deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
The conference is also attended by representatives from the
United Nations Program for HIV/AIDS and some non-governmental
organizations.

<HEADLINE> UK's FM Optimistic Over Annan's Lockerbie Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- United Kingdom Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said on Sunday that he is "very encouraged" by U.N.
chief Kofi Annan's talks with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi about
the Lockerbie suspects.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in an interview to the BBC television after
speaking to the United Nations Secretary-General, who held talks
with Gaddafi late on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I think I am very encouraged by what he tells me... I think
you could sum up our mood as one of qualified optimism," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Kofi has been successful in getting across the message that we
are serious about this trial," said the foreign secretary.
</P>
<P>
Cook said it was "possible" that the two Libyans, who were
accused of bombing in December 21, 1988, could be in custody by
the 10th anniversary of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"It is certainly a possibility,(but) it is by no means a
certainty," said he.
</P>
<P>
Cook also said that Kofi Annan had told Gaddafi the insistence
of the United States and Britain that the two men should serve
their sentences in Scotland if found guilty.
</P>
<P>
Britain and U.S are still seeking to put the two Libyans on
trial under Scottish law in Holland.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal
to hand over the two suspects who are accused of blowing up an
American airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988,
killing 270 people.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges End to Sanctions Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said here on Monday that Moscow is doing its best to have
the economic sanctions against Iraq lifted.
</P>
<P>
"With the UNSCOM operation resumed, a comprehensive review of
Iraq's compliance with U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding
its disarmament should be started without delay," Ivanov said
after meeting Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has pursued the idea of such a review in a hope that it
will accelerate the lifting of the crippling oil embargo, imposed
by the U.N. Security Council following Iraq's invasion to Kuwait
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who arrived here Sunday on a four-day working visit,
promised that Baghdad would honor its commitment with regard to
Russia. He also urged Moscow to press for lifting economic
sanctions against Iraq if the Arab country obeys U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq "respects its international commitment", and assured the
Russian government that its commitment would be met, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said everything must be done to have the UNSCOM move
towards its goal. "The removal of the sanctions will facilitate
the traditional links between Russia and Iraq, particularly in the
trade and economic areas," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"We are approaching the end of a long process which has taken
eight years and brought great suffering to the Iraqi people. It
is important now that everybody show special political
responsibility and bring this work to its logical end," Ivanov
said, reflecting on talks last week with UNSCOM Chairman Richard
Butler.
</P>
<P>
Russia "has been and will be working for stringent compliance
with all U.N. Security Council resolutions", Ivanov said.
"Compliance by Iraq with all disarmament conditions set by the
Security Council must result in the lifting of the oil embargo
against Iraq," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Aziz, Iraq expected that "a comprehensive review
of the fulfillment by Baghdad of the disarmament requirements of
the U.N. Security Council resolutions will be made next month."
</P>
<P>
Aziz is also scheduled to meet with Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov later of Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the New York Times reported on Monday
that Washington seemed ready to accept a U.N. review of Iraqi
sanctions in the hope that the review would prove again that Iraq
still has much to answer for its banned weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
"Such an outcome would strengthen the U.S. policy of keeping
sanctions in place indefinitely," the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Confident of HK's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said
here Monday that Hong Kong is already on the way to recovery and
he is very confident of its future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the French Business Association Seminar held here
Monday afternoon, Tung described 1998 as an extremely difficult
year, saying that Hong Kong's economy has been greatly affected by
Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong's property prices have come down some
55 percent. Its costs, including wages, are adjusting.
Unemployment, unfortunately, has almost doubled to 5.3 percent
lately. Hong Kong's economy this year will contract some 5 percent
overall.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "we are becoming more competitive, and our
banking system has always been very sound and continues to be very
sound", and "the Hong Kong government has always been very
conservative in managing the balance sheet".
</P>
<P>
Tung expressed the belief that Hong Kong is in a much better
position than many of the other Asian economies, to get the
recovery going.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong is fortunate to be the gateway of the
fastest growing economy in the world.
</P>
<P>
The very first thing Hong Kong should do is therefore to
position itself properly to take advantage of the tremendous
opportunities on the mainland, under the framework of "one
country, two systems", he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should grasp the opportunity to expand further our links
and economic cooperation with the mainland," he said.
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, he said Hong Kong should also strive to keep up
its international cosmopolitan features: diversity, dynamism, and
an expanded and global horizon for the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
"We will also focus on creating an environment in which
innovation and technology can flourish" while not losing sight of
the importance of Hong Kong's traditional economic strongholds
such as financial services, tourism and a center for multinational
companies in Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
But most important of all, "we will continue to be fully
committed to sound macro economic policies, a free and open
market, a free and open economy, with no capital controls," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe strongly in upholding the rule of law here in Hong
Kong," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that Hong Kong will continue to invest heavily in
infrastructure projects such as building railways, roads as well
as in education in order to ensure its competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Young Gymnasts Take Team Title in Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- With an all-around domination,
defending champion China led all the way to savor the top team
honors in the first-day gymnastics competition Monday at the
Bangkok Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese coaches were not so care about the gold, their
seventh in a row since the 1974 Asian Games, what they were really
happy about was that their young generation of gymnasts have came
up and made a sounding debute at the international turf with a
stable performence of world class quality.
</P>
<P>
Led by 21-year-old world champion Zhang Jingjin, the Chinese
team of Huang Xu, Yang Wei, Xing Aowei, Li Xiaopeng and Zhao Sheng
collected 38.375 points from their first apparatus of the vaulting
horse, building a 0.900 cusion against closest Asian Japan.
</P>
<P>
As the competition went on, the confident Chinese young talents
were far ahead of the rest teams through the parallel bars,
horizontal bar, and the floor exercise.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Xing Aowei then turned his rotation on the
pommel horse into a showcase by scoring an event-high 9.800, which
lifting China to an unbeatble lead of 191.800 against Japan's
188.075 and South Korea's 187.625.
</P>
<P>
"They did much better than what we had expected before the
competition," said Chinese team leader Qian Kui, "Most of the kids
are on their first Asian Games and they just made much less
mistakes than what we thought. Their performence can match anyone
in the world levels."
</P>
<P>
With outstanding outs on the pommel horse, South Korea took the
silver medal by ousting Japan in the last rotation by 225.750 to
225.275.
</P>
<P>
When asked when the rest of Asia could catch up with China in
the team level, South Korean coach Lee Young-taik said through an
interpret: "Not now, the Chinese are too strong. They are far
ahead in Asia. Maybe in the future we could reach their level."
</P>
<P>
But China's head coach Huang Yubin expected tough competition
in the individual events: "Although not many teams in Asian could
build a balance team as we do, but they really have some
outstanding individul gymnasts, like Yeo Hong-chul of South Korea
and Sergey Fedorchenko of the Kazakhstan."
</P>
<P>
Yeo scored the day-high point of 9.875 on the vaulting horse
while Sergey Fedorchenko and teammate A. Dmitriyenko both marked
the second vault best of 9.850. China's best vaulter was Zhang
Jingjin with 9.725.
</P>
<P>
"We will dominate the parallel bars, floor exercises and pommel
horse while the vault, horizontal bar and rings will be shared by
South Korea, Kazakhstan, Thailand and Japan," Huang said, "the
individul events would be very tough."

<HEADLINE> Young Chinese Man Without Legs Doing Well in College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Tang Yue, a young man in the
city of Chongqing who lost his legs three fingers of his left hand
in a railway accident on his way home from primary school 20 years
ago, says he is doing quite well two months into college life.
</P>
<P>
Tang finished primary and secondary school by being carried on
his parents' backs for nine years. But he began going to school by
himself by holding two stools in his hands when he entered senior
high school.
</P>
<P>
He passed the college entrance exams this July, 20 points above
the cutoff grade. But, no college would accept him because of his
amputations.
</P>
<P>
Then, some municipal government officials helped him start his
studies at a higher education institute two months ago and school
authorities have provided help by arranging a first-floor
dormitory and reducing fees. And, a factory in the city that makes
prosthetic devices has fixed him up with artificial limbs free of
charge.
</P>
<P>
Tang has adapted well to college life in two months and can
bathe himself and wash his clothes and clean his room all by
himself.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have shown love and care for me, which makes
me feel that I am part of a large family. I believe that I will be
able to do something for others someday," Tang says.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Proportion of World Population in Sharp Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The proportion of continental
Europeans to the world population, now at one seventh, will
decline sharply by the year 2025, said the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Population decline, currently underway in Eastern Europe, is
expected to spread throughout the continent," said the ECE. "The
developing world will absorb almost all of the three billion
increase projected then for the Earth."
</P>
<P>
The UN agency cited experts as saying that the demographic
changes were largely attributable to recent declines in birth
rates and increases in death rates in parts of the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy at birth of 80 years for women and 75 years for
men is fast becoming the norm in Western Europe, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, they said, many countries in Eastern Europe
had experienced increases in mortality in the 1990s. "There, life
expectancy at birth is lower by about eight years for both men and
women."

<HEADLINE> Progress Made in Combating Computer Software Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Robert Holleyman, the
president and CEO of the U.S.'s Business Software Alliance, says
that China has made progress in combating computer software piracy
in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
He says they are confident that with joint Chinese government,
software company, industrial, media, educational institution, and
general public efforts, piracy can be significantly curbed.
</P>
<P>
BSA released its "Contributions of the Software Industry to the
Chinese Economy", here today, which says that in 1997, China's
software market was worth 1.4 billion U.S. dollars. The software
industry provided more than 60,000 jobs and added more than 200
million U.S. dollars in tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
It says that China's software industry will grow at an annual
rate of 28 percent over the next 5 years and will be worth 3.6
billion U.S. dollars in 2001. That year, the industry will provide
more than 100,000 jobs and add more than 500 million U.S. dollars
to government tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
The report was based on a study of 100 companies active in
China's software industry, 74 percent of which are headquartered
in China. It was done by PricewaterhouseCoopers with the
assistance of China's Research Center of Computer and
Microelectronics Industrial Development-Marketing Information
Center.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 percent of the companies surveyed said that piracy has
had a measurable effect on their sales. Most Chinese software
companies know that piracy seriously prevents further growth and
development of the software industry, reduces the overall
competitiveness of the local software industry, and places it in
an adverse position in the international market.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the study was done in China, as well as the
positive response to the findings, indicates a new level of
cooperation between the world's software companies and China in
dealing with the piracy issue, Holleyman says.
</P>
<P>
BSA was founded in Washington D.C. in 1988, and includes the
world's leading software manufacturers like Microsoft, Lotus, IBM,
Compaq and Intel. It has a representative office in Beijing and
links with many organizations in China.

<HEADLINE> Africa Makes Significant Strides in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) said Monday that the African continent has
made significant strides in consolidating democracy, promoting
good governance and building new partnerships with the civil
societies of its members.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Victoria Oku, director of
Administration of the OAU, on behalf of OAU Secretary General, at
the 4-day Second Conference on Democracy, Civil Society and
Governance in Africa, which was opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
She noted that many African countries have embarked upon a
process of political transition with the objective of
institutionalizing democratic practices.
</P>
<P>
"In 1996, 18 states in Africa conducted multi-party elections
and in 1997, over 10 countries were involved in multi-party
elections," she said, adding that the OAU has so far taken part
in the observation of some 60 presidential and legislative
elections at the invitation of the countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
Lalla ben Barka, depute executive secretary of the United
Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), said at the meeting
that Africa still "face certain challenges that make the
transition to peaceful, democratic and pluralist system of
governance very difficult," as the continent continues to be
traumatized by wars and conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Referring to conflicts in the Horn of Africa, the Great Lakes
region, Southern Africa and West Africa, Barka said "these
conflicts have had and continue to have extremely adverse effect
on the evolution and consolidation of democracy in the
continent."
</P>
<P>
"Without peace and stability no amount of effort will secure
enduring democracy or lasting improvement in governance," she
noted.
</P>
<P>
During the 4-day meeting, participants from 25 African
countries will assess and evaluate the progress of democracy and
good governance in "early starters" countries, such as Cote
d'Ivoire, Benin, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe,
Botswana and Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
The First Conference on Democracy, Civil Society and
Governance in Africa was held in December 1997.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Detectors Predict Solar Events </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Some Chinese detectors on the
FY-2 meteorological satellite have helped detect two solar events
that can help Chinese satellites.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Center for Space
Science and Applied Research (CSSAR) added a solar X-ray detector
and a space particle detector to the satellite, which was launched
in June of 1997, according to Wang Shijin, deputy-director of
CSSAR's Space Environment Probe Lab.
</P>
<P>
The detectors can detect a large high energy particle flux that
could damage man-made satellites, Wang explains. When there is a
solar flare, solar x-rays will reach the earth a few hours earlier
than the high energy particle flux, giving the detectors time to
forecast a particle flux.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen solar flares were seen by the solar X-ray
detector on November 3 and 4, 1997, and scientists at CSSAR
decided that they indicated a proton event and immediately warned
organizations about the need to protect their satellites.
</P>
<P>
On the evening of November 6, 1997, the detector again
predicted a proton event and results received from the space
particle detectors proved this to be true, Wang says.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Support S.Korea's DPRK Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Monday appealed to
the United States to support its policy of engaging the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
South Korean Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Hong Soon-young
made the appeal when he met with visiting U.S. policy coordinator
on the DPRK William Perry.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Hong explained to Perry that the engagement
policy was the most realistic and effective policy under the
current circumstances, said a South Korean official.
</P>
<P>
"If we continue to push for the (engagement) policy on a long
and mid-term perspective, it will help improve South-North Korean
relations," Hong was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Perry, who arrived here Sunday, is empowered to gather
first-hand material of how South Korea views the suspected DPRK
underground nuclear site in Kumchangni, some 40 kilometers
northwest of Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Hong told Perry, who also discussed the Kumchangni issue with
President Kim Dae-jung Monday, that the issue should be carefully
dealt with as there was no "conclusive evidence" that it was
nuclear-related.
</P>
<P>
Perry is due to meet South Korean Defense Minister Chun
Yong-taek before leaving for a visit to China Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Perry's visit coincided with the nuclear talks held between
U.S. special envoy Charles Kartman and DPRK Deputy Foreign
Minister Kim Gye-kwan in Washington Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington talks, followed by the talks in New York Friday
and Saturday, are the third round since Kartman and Kim held the
first meeting in Pyongyang last month.
</P>
<P>
During the previous talks, Washington demanded that Pyongyang
allow U.S. access to the Kumchangni site to clear away the
suspicion that the site is nuclear related.
</P>
<P>
However, Pyongyang, which initially refused the U.S. offer by
saying it was "insulting", now insists that Washington pay 300
million U.S. dollars in return for the inspection.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Teenager Defies Odds to Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Japanese teenage Yasuko Tajima
overhauled China's world record holder Chen Yan to wrench a gold
in the women's 400m individual medley here on Monday when China
and Japan split all five golds at stake on the first-day of
swimming competition at the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
The gold has been considered as a certainty for China who
boasts a "double safe", namely world record holder and world
champion Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan, world recorder in women's 200m
individual medley.
</P>
<P>
But Tajima proved it was not. The 17-year-old teenager raced
to a one-length lead in the first butterfly leg and built it up to
over four seconds after the backstroke leg, leaving Chen and Wu
far behind.
</P>
<P>
She then gave her rivals no chance, powering home in 4 minutes
and 39.92 seconds. Wu came in second in 4:46.74, with Chen third
in 4:47.34, well below her own world record of 4:34.79.
</P>
<P>
But Tajima was not satisfied with her triumph. She said: "That
wa not a real victory, because this was not a close race against
the Chinese and I lost concentration in the end."
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to beat them at the 2000 Sydney Olympics," the
Japanese prodigy said with confidence.
</P>
<P>
Tajima's performance surprised her Chinese opponents. "This is
Tajima's personal best this year," said Chinese coach Wu Jicai,
"Chen and Wu had overtrained the last whole year to prepare for
the Chinese Eighth National Games and the World Championships, and
they are now in low forms."
</P>
<P>
Chen set the new world record of women's 400m individual medley
in the Chinese Eighth National Games while 20-year-old Wu rewrote
the world mark of women's 200m individual medley with a winning
time of 2:09.72 in the domestic games.
</P>
<P>
Those two sensations continued their winning momentum in the
World Championships in January when Chen won in 400m freestyle and
individual medley and Wu claimed the 200m individual medley in
Perth, Australia.
</P>
<P>
"Chen was hampered by a waist injury," said Chinese swimming
head coach Zhang Xiong, "The bed pad in the Village is too soft
and slowed her speed to convalesce."
</P>
<P>
The gold of men's 200m freestyle also went to Japan when Yosuke
Ichikawa clocked a winning time of 1:52.46 in the finals. Torlarp
Sethsothorn of Thailand finished second in 1:52.53. Ichikawa's
teammate Shusuke Ito won the bronze in 1:52.81.
</P>
<P>
All other three golds were clinched by Chinese swimmers.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 100m freestyle finals, 20-year-old defending
champion Shan Ying, who qualified as the last-but-one, led
throughout the whole course, touching home in 56.20 seconds to win
the gold.
</P>
<P>
Her teammate Chao Na, who swam shoulder to shoulder with Shan
in the first 50 meters, clocked 56.39 to settle equally with
Japan's Sumika Minamoto for the silver.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Zeng Qiliang, staved off a strong challenge
from defending champion Japanese Akira Hayashi to finish first in
the men's 100m breaststroke in 1:02.32. Hayashi managed the
silver in 1:02.55. The bronze went to Malaysia's Elvin Chia, who
was timed 1:03.09.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women swimmers proved they were still invincible in
4x200m freestyle relay race in Asia when they clocked 8:08.00 to
retain the gold by a big margin. Japan followed in second in
8:12.06. Chinese Taipei overtook South Korea in the last leg to
win the bronze.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Study of Chinese River Dolphin under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese have begun a major
survey along the Yangtze river on the white flag dolphin, which is
believed to be on the verge of extinction.
</P>
<P>
Wildlife specialists in 19 ships with special equipment are
cruising up and down on the middle and lower reaches of the
Yangtze to determine the exact number of the mammals, what their
environment is, and their prospects for the future.
</P>
<P>
The white flag dolphin is unique to China. Official statistics
put its numbers at fewer than 100, much fewer than the more
publicized giant panda. In a similar study last year, wildlife
specialists spotted only 21 dolphins.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Agriculture's Fishing Bureau, the
sponsor of the study, the central government will work out a
comprehensive plan based on the results of the study to ensure the
survival of the animal.
</P>
<P>
Ecological data on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze
produced by the December 4-9 study, will be published with an
environmental report on the Three Gorges Dam early next year.
</P>
<P>
Foggy and windy weather along the river has prevented the
scientists from finding very much so far.

</P>
<P>
Unfancied Yasuko Tajima of Japan beat China's world individual

world champion Wu and 7.40 faster than Chen, world record holder
for the event.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Zhang Xiong said Chen had been troubled by
back muscle strain and wasn't in her top form.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Yosuke Ichikawa won the men's 200m freestyle event
in a time of 1:52.46, beating Thailand's Torlarp Sethsothorn
into second place by 0.07 seconds.

</P>
<P>
Zhang posed a serious face after the competitions while the
Japanese head coach was all smiles.
</P>
<P>
Chinese sharpshooters, who aim for half of the shooting titles

<HEADLINE> Vietnam-ASEAN Trade Near 5.3B Dollars in 10 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Trade value of Vietnam with the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members reached
nearly 5.3 billion U.S. dollars in the first ten months of this
year, according to Vietnam News Agency (VNA) Monday.
</P>
<P>
During this period, Vietnam earned 1.8 billion dollars from
exports to other ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
Trade with other ASEAN countries now accounts for about 30
percent of Vietnam's total foreign trade value.
</P>
<P>
Of the ASEAN countries, Singapore is Vietnam's largest trade
partner with annual two-way trade value rising to more than 3
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Singapore imports crude oil, coffee, seafood, textiles and
garments, and footwear from Vietnam, while selling motorbike and
car accessories, fertilizers, oil and petrol, steel and iron to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
In the first ten months of 1998, Vietnam earned more than 1
billion U.S. dollars from exports to Singapore and imported goods
worth nearly 2.3 billion dollars from this country alone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vietnam's trade with Thailand stood at 600 million
dollars, with the Philippines nearly 400 million dollars, with
Malaysia nearly 270 million dollars, and with Laos more than 85
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, trade with ASEAN countries has been hindered by many
difficulties since mid-1997 due to the devaluation of the
currencies of many ASEAN countries, according to Vietnam's
Ministry of Trade.
</P>
<P>
Many main export items of Vietnam lose their competitive edge
compared with the same kinds produced by other ASEAN members.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Singapore
Navy is now engaged in separate joint exercises with its Brunei
and Swedish counterparts, according to announcements of the
Singapore Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
The RSN and the Royal Brunei Navy started Monday an annual

<P>
In the exercise, the Brunei navy is represented by command
teams from three missile gunboats while the Singapore navy is
represented by command teams from a missile corvette, a missile
gunboat, a patrol vessel and a f-50 maritime patrol aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also said that Exercise PELICAN, the 20th in

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will soon
hold a public hearing on 11 contentious bills designed to restore
Thailand's economy, Thai News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted government spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart as
saying that representatives from relevant parties would be invited
to the hearing to be held in the Government House Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The public hearing is the government's attempt to appease
public criticism and strong opposition from both the opponents and
senators who said the bills would blaze the way for foreigners to
acquire greater local assets.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai will open and chair the hearing,
and Finance Minister Tarin Nimmanhaeminda will lead concerned
ministers to explain the bills and the need for the bills to the
public.
</P>
<P>
The hearing will be broadcast on Channel 9 and Channel 11 as
well as on radio stations. Questions from the audiences are
welcome.
</P>
<P>
Akapol said findings and the views expressed at the hearing
would be compiled to supplement the government's further
consideration on whether the amendment bills would go ahead.
</P>
<P>
"What all we want to do is to clarify the public understanding
over the contentious bills on how they are vital to bringing the
country's economy back on track and not at the expenses of the
Thais," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Farmers Block Border Crossings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. farmers shut down several
border crossings between Canada and three midwest U.S. states
Sunday to protest against what they say are unfair Canadian
trading practices, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of American farmers from Minnesota, North Dakota and
Montana closed several entry points to Canadian trucks for three
hours.
</P>
<P>
"All of us here are trying to play by the rules," said one man,
who joined about 40 other farmers at Pembina, North Dakota, to
turn away Canadian trucks from the third-busiest
Canada-U.S. border point.
</P>
<P>
The protesters alleged the Canadian Wheat Board was dumping
cheap grain into the United States, driving down American prices
and threatening the local economy.
</P>
<P>
In fact, a new bilateral trade agreement, announced Friday, has
been hailed by the governors of several grain-belt states and by
major farm groups such as American Farm Bureau Federation. But the
protesting farmers say the deal doesn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
They demanded a fixed currency exchange rate between the two
nations and an immediate moratorium on all Canadian agricultural
products entering the United States.
</P>
<P>
Farm trade between the U.S. and Canada is worth about 21
billion Canadian dollars (13.65 billion U.S.dollars) a year.

Two of those accused, doctor Dieter Binus and coach Rolf

<HEADLINE> Arafat Doubts Netanyahu's Sincerity on Wye Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat expressed on Monday his
doubts over the sincerity of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to implement the latest peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Israeli opposition Meretz Party leader
Yossi Sarid in Gaza, Arafat noted that Netanyahu tries to avoid
carrying out the terms of the land-for-security accord on which he
signed.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached on October 23, Israel would hand
over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians during the
second redeployment, in return for tougher measures by the PNA
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu warned last Thursday that Israel would suspend
the troop pullback until the PNA made concessions over the issues
such as the release of Palestinian prisoners and the Palestinian
statehood.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has on several occasions reaffirmed that he would
declare an independent Palestinian state next May when the Oslo
accord expires, but this was bluntly rejected by Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Monday the Palestinians continued demonstrations in the West
Bank in protest of the Israeli government's refusal to release the
Palestinian prisoners charged with anti-Israel activities.
</P>
<P>
Of the 750 Palestinian prisoners that Israeli agreed to release
as stipulated in the peace deal, 250 were freed last month, but most
of them were common criminal, rather than political detainees.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Palestinians gathered at a road crossing near the
West Bank town of Ramallah and burned tires. But no clashes
between the demonstrators and Israeli troops were reported.
</P>
<P>
The latest disputes between Israel and the Palestinians over
the implementation of the peace agreement came on the eve of a
tour by the United States President Bill Clinton in the region.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to arrive here Saturday night for a
three-day visit in Israel and the Palestinian-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli official told Israel radio Monday that a three-way
meeting between Clinton, Netanyahu and Arafat could take place on
Monday in the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu noted on Sunday that Clinton's visit will be
valued only if he stresses the fulfillment of the Palestinian
commitment under the agreement during his tour.
</P>
<P>
Some Israeli officials now expressed the fear that that Clinton
setting foot on the soil under Palestinian self rule would give a
boost to Palestinians' desire for statehood.

<HEADLINE> Japan Clean Sweeps Three Golds in Judo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Japanese made a clean sweep of
all three medals offered on the first day of judo competition in
the Asian Games here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tokuno Kazuhiko, who won the World Cup title in Minsk, Belarus
in November, beat Yang Bo of China in the men's 60-kilogram
category to win the gold.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old, a policeman at home, counted on his expierence
and explosive power to overwhelm Yang, who looked a bit nervous
most of the time.
</P>
<P>
"This is my first Asian Games victory and I hope I can win in
next year's world championships," said Tokumo, who jumped to fame
by winning the gold of the same class in the East Asian Games at
Pusan, South Korea in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Larpanant Thiti shared the third place with South
Korea's Kyun Seung-Hoon before a boisterous home crowd.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 66-kg category, Nakamura Yukimasa disposed off
Ivan Beglayev of Kazakhstan for the win. The third place went to
Mongolia's U. Erdenebaatar and Iran's Arash Miresmaeili.
</P>
<P>
Makabe Tomoe completed Japan's clean sweep in the women's 48-kg
class by beating DPR Korea's Cha Hyon-Hyang with an unanimous
decision.
</P>
<P>
Three referees also ruled Tomoe the winner after neither of the
two finalists could score during the five-minute duel.
</P>
<P>
"I felt a little stressed in the first match against Yu
Shu-Chen of Chinese Taipei, but I got completely relaxed from the
second on," the 24-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
Gao Lijian of China failed cross the second-round hurdle when
she dropped to DPR Korea's Cha Hyon-Hyang, whom she defeated in an
international judo competition in northeast China's Changchun in
September.
</P>
<P>
Gao, 18, displayed spectacluar form after the loss and scored
two successive victory to finish joint third with Cha.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian Games was even more competitive than the world
championships and Olympic Games since Japan and South Korea were
the two of the most powerful nations of the sport, " said Liu
Yuqi, manager of the Chinese national team.
</P>
<P>
But Yang's coach Liu Wugong said it's the starting point for
the two Chinese judocas because they are still very young.
</P>
<P>
"Yang is only 19 and Gao 18, they will be the medal hopefuls in
the Sydney Olympic Games," Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes 1.5 Tonnes of Narcotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Monday
that nearly 1,500 kilograms of narcotics were seized from Afghan
traffickers in the northeastern Khorasan province in the past
two days.
</P>
<P>
The official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) quoted a
report from the provincial security forces as saying that the
drugs included 106 kilograms of heroin and 1386 kilograms of
opium.
</P>
<P>
During armed clashes with traffickers in several parts of the
province, the Iranian security forces killed seven traffickers
and arrested seven others, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Iran launched strict campaigns against drug trafficking in 1989
after the Iranian Majlis passed an anti-drug law, which allows
death punishment on those caught with more than 30 grams of heroin
or five kilograms of opium.
</P>
<P>
Despite of an increase in the amount of confiscated drugs
during recent years, drug trafficking remains as a serious problem
for Iran as it is one of the best transit route for smugglers to
carry drugs from Afghanistan to Europe.

<HEADLINE> Defecting Khmer Rouge Commanders Arrive in Phnom Penh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PNOM PENH, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A group of Khmer Rouge
commanders who surrendered to the Royal Government of Cambodia
last Friday arrived here Monday from the Thai-Cambodia border at
Preah Vihear and Samlot.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held for them by the Information
Ministry, they said their defection to the government means
Cambodia's 20-year civil war has finally ended. "We want to have
peace and stability in our country. Fellow countrymen must stop
fighting with each other," they said.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Khmer Rouge troops under Ta Mok agreed to
unconditional defection last Friday following more than four hours
of negotiation in Preah Vihear with Meas Sophea, the Royal
Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF)'s deputy chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
Among the defecting commanders are Ta Mok's top military and
policy aides, including Pol Non, Dul Saroeun, Ta Them, Khem Nguon
and Nuon Nou.
</P>
<P>
Also, Iem Phan and Ta Mok's son-in-law Ta Muth, who have been
commanding troops in Samlot district in Battambang for the last 17
months, will defect with their troops, according to military
officials.
</P>
<P>
Military analysts said various factors contributed to the
timing of the defection, such as the formation of the new
coalition government and its recognition by the international
community as well as the capitulation of most of the resistance
forces loyal to Prince Ranariddh and so on.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen last Saturday expressed his welcome to
the defectors. He said, "at this new historical stage, your
actions have reflected your good will in strengthening peace and
national unification."
</P>
<P>
But Hun Sen reiterated Monday when he met with Vietnamese
Ambassador to Cambodia Nguyen Duy Hung that three Khmer Rouge top
hard-liners Ta Mok, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan must be tried. The
tribunal to try them should take place in Cambodia with the help
of the international community, and they must be tried in
accordance with Cambodia's law.
</P>
<P>
"Recently, the recapture of rebel forces-controlled areas along
the Thai-Cambodian border has been going on smoothly. With the
defection, Ta Mok, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are further
isolated," said Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
"Now we can say the danger of the return of the Khmer Rouge has
totally disappeared. This is very important to the security and
development of the country. It will also improve the investment
and tourism environment," the prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
But the defectors declined to offer the whereabouts of Ta Mok
and any information about the three top Khmer Rouge leaders.

<HEADLINE> Thai Railway Company Targets Property Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The State Railway of Thailand
(SRT) is overhauling its regulations to make the most of property
development on its 250,000-rai (40,000 hectares) land nationwide,
Thai News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The revamp would start with adjusting the assessed prices of
its land to attract more private investors.
</P>
<P>
At present, the prices are as much as 20 percent higher than
the reference prices of the Land Department and this discourages
developers regarding high rents based on the assessed prices.
</P>
<P>
Particularly under the current economic situation, the assessed
prices should be reduced to lure investment.
</P>
<P>
The current assessed prices discourage about 500 land leases of
the SRT from renewing their contracts. If they were adjusted and
those contracts were extended, the SRT would generate over 10
million baht (270,000 U.S. dollars) immediately.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the SRT is planning to hire the private sector to
collect rents from its land leases and to manage property
development on its land.
</P>
<P>
The move should generate more income from the SRT's land
because the state enterprise was facing difficulties in collecting
rents and managing its property due to insufficient personnel.
</P>
<P>
The SRT management will present the land development proposal
to its board of directors for approval.
</P>
<P>
If the proposal is endorsed, the SRT will enjoy more income by
simply collecting benefit and seeing its private contractors
develop its land on its behalf.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abu Dhabi, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The 19th summit of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) opened here Monday evening with the aim of
cementing regional cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The GCC was born in Abu Dhabi in May 1981 when the leaders of
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates held their first summit.
</P>
<P>
The six Arab gulf states formed the alliance designed to enhance
coordination, cooperation and unification of the member states in all
fields in a strategic and oil-rich region.
</P>
<P>
The GCC has three main structures, namely, the Supreme Council, the
Ministerial Council and the Secretarial General based in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the group meet once a year to develop their plans for
collective security and economic unity.
</P>
<P>
One of the main GCC targets is to establish a common market,
unifying custom duties, industrial policies and investment laws and
setting up a unified currency.
</P>
<P>
The six countries produce nearly 13.5 million barrels of oil each
day, accounting for one fifth of the world's total of oil production.
Their oil reserves, which are estimated at 465 billion barrels,
account for 45 percent of the total global oil resources.
</P>
<P>
The GCC oil producers, whose economy depends heavily on oil
earnings, have taken a hard hit in the current oil price slump
resulting from oversupply and flagging demand. Eitem

<HEADLINE> Sexual Diseases Third Most Common Infectious Disease In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Sexually transmitted diseases
(STDs), which had practically disappeared from China a few decades
ago are now just behind dysentery and hepatitis as the most common
infectious diseases, according to the National STD Control Center
(NSCC).
</P>
<P>
China reported 461,510 cases of STDs last year, a rise of 15.8
percent from 1996, an incidence of 37 persons per 100,000. But,
the real number may be five to ten times the reported figure, the
Ministry of Health (MOH) says. A new MOH document says that most
cases are not reported because patients often go to private or
unauthorized clinics to keep the matter quiet.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the cases involved extra-marital sex, but
20 percent of the cases occur in married couples. People in
well-developed areas and cities run a higher risk of getting the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the cases reported are in Guangdong, Jiangsu,
Zhejiang, and Sichuan provinces and in the city of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Although gonorrhea is the leading STD in China, syphilis is
increasing at a rate of 62 percent every year, and an increasing
number of new-born babies were STD victims last year. The
incidence of STDs among children less than a month old rose by 70
percent last year from 1996. Doctors fear that the situation may
worsen if pre-marital health checks are not tightened.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean President to Discipline Military Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung will soon discipline military leaders responsible for
recent accidents in which 11 soldiers were killed, presidential
spokesman Park Jie-won said Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said, "Investigations of the accidents
are still under way and it is still too early to talk about the
scope and timing of disciplinary action. The president did not
make concrete comments on the issue."
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek will be
sacked, the spokesman did not give a clear-cut reply.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman's remarks were seen as an apparent response to
pressures from the public and the opposition Grand National Party
(GNP)to sack the defense minister in the wake of the recent
accidents.
</P>
<P>
"The accidents, which involve the army, air force and navy, are
the results of lax discipline and the rock-bottom state of
morale," said Ahn Taik-soo of the GNP.
</P>
<P>
Ahn said President Kim's pursuit of an engagement policy
toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is to
blame for the loose discipline and low morale among servicemen.
</P>
<P>
"The sunshine policy caused confusion over just who our chief
enemy is and this resulted in lax discipline and low morale," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Public trust in the military would decrease if no one,
including the defense minister, assumed responsibility, the GNP
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Last week's military accidents came on the heels of a failure
by the South Korean military to capture an alleged DPRK spy boat
which was found in the South's west coast waters last month.
</P>
<P>
In the past four weeks, the 11 soldiers, mostly with the army,
were either killed by tanks or in explosions or car crashes.
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented accident, an air force anti-aircraft
missile was accidentally launched last Friday, injuring
three.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Aims for Public Services' ESD to Business, Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government has embarked on developing
electronic service delivery (ESD) of public services to business
and the community with 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week access, a
government official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jessie Ting, deputy secretary for information and technology
and broadcasting, made this announcement at a press conference
here Monday on the Hong Kong Information Infrastructure Expo and
Conference slated for March 4-7 next year.
</P>
<P>
The event at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center is
organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC) and the
Information Technology and Broadcasting Bureau (ITBB).
</P>
<P>
Ting said that ITBB has formulated the "Digital 21" IT
Strategy, the primary objective of which is to promote Hong Kong's
information infrastructure and services as so to make Hong Kong a
leading digital city in a globally connected world of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
"Promotion of a wider use of IT in the community and providing
support to the IT industry are key elements of our strategy. The
coorganization of the Information Infrastructure Expo and
Conference with the TDC will contribute to our efforts in these
two areas," she explained.
</P>
<P>
An ITBB pavilion at the Expo will introduce on-line government
services and the launching of the Electronic Service Delivery
Scheme. And among other participating agencies are the Hongkong
Post, Inland Revenue Department, Information Services Department,
Office of the Telecommunications Authority and the Hong Kong
Tourist Association.
</P>
<P>
And Canada and Australia have been invited to the Expo and
Conference, under the auspices of the Memorandum of Understanding
on IT cooperation with the two countries.
</P>
<P>
TDC is committed to developing the exposition and conference
into an annual event to further promote Hong Kong as the region's
communication and IT hub, said TDC's Deputy Executive Director
Frederick Lam said at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
It is a timely project in line with the strategy outlined in
the Policy Address of Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, to make Hong
Kong a leader, not a follower, in the information world of
tomorrow, he said. The SAR government emphasized the importance
of using IT to help Hong Kong to retain its competitive edge and
to drive its overall economic expansion, he added.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural Hong Kong Information Infrastructure Expo and
Conference last year put forward many "futuristic" scenarios,
while this year's event will emphasize the actual application of
the latest electronic and information technologies in business and
in daily life.
</P>
<P>
the 1999 event includes a four-day exposition and a full-day
conference, with an expected participation of 50,000 visitors, the
organizers said.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Stock Prices Up 27 Percent Monday Morning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices on the Seoul market
on Monday soared by 27.51 percent, closing the day at 518.22, for
the first time in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Seoul stock market allowed the prices to
fluctuate 15 percent, up from the former 12 percent restriction,
under a set of new regulations introduced last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Observers and dealers said the share prices surged as South
Korean won-denominated bonds were upgraded by U.S. credit rating
agency Moody's and the restructuring of the nation's top five
family-owned conglomerates -- Hyundai, Daewoo, Samsung, LG and Sk
-- continued.
</P>
<P>
They said the stock market could experience a further rally as
investors still believed that share prices were undervalued,
predicting that the price index would rise to 550 points late this
month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South Korean won continued to appreciate Monday
morning to 1,206 against the U.S. dollar from 1,212 last weekend.
The greenback is at its lowest since July 28 this year when it
sank to 1,185 won.

<HEADLINE> Detained U.N. Staff Freed in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Observer Mission in
Angola announced Monday that the 14 peacekeepers who were
detained 24 days ago by the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) had been set free.
</P>
<P>
According to a press communique issued Monday, the observers
-- ten Indians, one Bulgarian, a Swedish, a Senegalese and a
Brazilian -- who were freed last Saturday are now in "good
health."
</P>
<P>
The communique attributed the development to the great amount
of diplomatic efforts on the part of the U.N. special envoy to
Angola Issa Diallo, saying the U.N. Observer Mission is "glad" to
see the smooth settlement of the incident.
</P>
<P>
The mission also expressed gratitude to the U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan, the international community and the U.N.
Security Council for their support and encouragement.
</P>
<P>
On November 14, the opposition UNITA forces obstructed the
staff of the U.N. mission in withdrawing from the country's
central highland cities of Bailundo and Andulo with the excuse
that the airport needed "maintenance".
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the UNITA wanted to detain the
U.N. personnel as hostages in a bid to defend the military
attacks launched by the government army.

<HEADLINE> China Stopping Companies from Dumping Goods On The Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is
taking action against the dumping of industrial goods on the
domestic market, according to Bi Jingquan, director of the State
Development Planning Commission's Price Management Department.
</P>
<P>
Bi told a news conference here today that the SDPC and the
State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) passed a regulation
last month to stop this unfair business practice.
</P>
<P>
There has been a surplus of many industrial products in China
since the start of the 1990s as a result of changes in the
international and domestic markets, leading to price-cutting
competition.
</P>
<P>
The dumping of goods at a price below cost by some enterprises
has disrupted the normal economic order, Bi says, and it is
illegal in China and an infringement on consumer rights.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation says that price management departments have
to correct or stop the selling of products at a price below either
the average industry cost or individual cost.
</P>
<P>
The government protects normal competition and respects the
rights of enterprises to set the price of their manufactured
goods, Bi says, but they must honor the principle of fair
competition.

<HEADLINE> German Industrial Output Up, Orders Down in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- German industrial production
increased by one percent while new orders fell by two percent in
October, the German Finance Ministry reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The October production figures were spearheaded by a 1.5
percent rise in the manufacture and mining sectors, the ministry
said. Industrial production in September registered a drop of 2.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result of stagnant construction and a 3.5 percent drop in
energy production, the combined industrial output in September and
October decreased by 2.5 percent in comparison with July and
August. However, the output figure was 2.3 percent higher than
the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said there was a continued gap between eastern and
western Germany.
</P>
<P>
In eastern Germany, production in the September-October period
was 1.4 percent higher than the same period last year, while
western Germany saw a growth rate of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector grew by 7.8 percent and consumer goods
output surged by 19.9 percent in eastern Germany in September and
October, in comparison with a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, new orders for German industry sank by 2.5 percent
in October compared with September, including a 3.5 percent
fall-off in export orders. Domestic demand was also down by two
percent during the month.
</P>
<P>
Eastern German orders in September and October were 8.3 percent
higher than the corresponding period of 1997. Western German
orders, however, were down by 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indian Congress Party Attacks Govt for Mismanagement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- India's biggest opposition
party Congress Monday attacked the government led by the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) for what it called total mismanagement of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Congress members said in Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of
India's Parliament, that signs of virtual economic collapse were
evident with revenue collection falling short by 100 billion
rupees (2.35 billion U.S. dollars) during the first five months of
the current fiscal year beginning from April 1.
</P>
<P>
During a discussion of the worsening price situation and the
economic recession in the country, Pranab Mukherjee, a Congress
member, said India is heading towards a balance of payment crisis
as in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He said that the inflation rate climbed to 8.2 percent in
September from just 4.3 percent in the corresponding period of
1997.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit had doubled from 2.5 billion dollars during
the first six months of 1996-97 to about 5 billion dollars in the
April-September period this year, he said, adding that all the
economic parameters pointed to a slowdown of the economy.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released last Friday by the World Trade
Organization (WTO), India's cumulative trade figure for the first
seven months of fiscal 1998-99 went down by 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
WTO said world trade growth was estimated to fall to 4-5
percent from the projected 10 percent this year due to the
prolonged Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mukherjee, former commerce minister, criticized the government
for taking a long time to finalize the ninth five-year plan
projections, saying the first two years after the completion of
the eighth five-year plan, starting from April 1997, were actually
plan holidays.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government had failed to take appropriate
measures for stepping up infrastructure development and it was not
feasible to raise resources for the purpose from the market as
annual interest rates were as high as 13 to 14 percent.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Urged to Attract More Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-President Christon
Tembo Monday urged members of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) to create an environment that would
attract more foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Sixth Meeting of the
COMESA Council of Ministers held in Lusaka, Tembo said that, to
some extent, the success of the member states' economies in the
area of economic liberalization depends on their ability to
attract foreign direct investment and to facilitate cross border
investment.
</P>
<P>
He explained that it was due to this recognition that the
COMESA Authority, at its third summit in Kinshasa last June,
declared that the COMESA region should become a common investment
zone.
</P>
<P>
However, Tembo regretfully cited a recent U.N. report which
indicated that Africa received only 1.17 percent or 4.7 billion
U.S. Dollars out of the 95.4 billion Dollars of the world foreign
direct investment which went to developing countries in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, COMESA programs such as those on the elimination of
tariffs and non-tariff barriers, the protocol on the free
movement of persons and monetary facilitation programs are
intended to address this problem and make the region an
attractive investment area, said the vice-president.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Tembo also called on all the COMESA members to
address the challenges such as debt crisis and regional conflicts
the sub-region faces during its course of economic integration.
</P>
<P>
"Member states must endeavor to maintain peace and stability
so as to sustain the benefits of economic development. Without
peace, security and stability there can never be development or
democracy and good governance," Tembo stressed.
</P>
<P>
As for the debt crisis, he said more than 50 percent of the
members' export earnings go into debt repayment, so they should
collectively address to find "appropriate" solutions.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting with the theme of "Information: A Tool
for Increased Trade and Investment" attracted ministers and other
senior officials from 21 member states.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, which was established in 1994 to replace former
Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern Africa (PTA),
aims to achieve a free trade area by the year 2000 and a customs
union with a common external tariff by the year 2004.

JOHANNESBURG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 50 percent of
people who tested HIV positive in the land-locked Swaziland were

Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report was to mark the World AIDS Day which fell on
December 1, but was published in Mbabane, capital of Swaziland,

</P>
<P>
Only eight percent of those who tested HIV positive said they

</P>
<P>
HIV is precursor of killer AIDS, the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
</P>
<P>
The report said 76 percent admitted having sex outside
marriage and over half of those had sex with multiple partners.
</P>
<P>
Most of the infected students, aged between 15 and 18, were

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Returns to Hospital After Three Hours at Kremlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
returned to hospital mid-day on Monday, after three hours work in
the Kremlin where he sacked four key advisors.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in the Kremlin early Monday after a 15-day stay in
the Central Clinical Hospital for pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his arrival at the Kremlin, Yeltsin fired
Valentin Yumashev, head of the presidential administration, and
named Nikolai Bordyuzha, secretary of the Russian Security
Council, to replace him.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given for removing Yumashev, but it is understood
that his resignation had been sought for some time.
</P>
<P>
First deputy head of administration Yuri Yarov and deputy heads
of administration Mikhail Komissar and Yevgeny Savostyanov were
also dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Yumashev, Yeltsin's chief of staff for more than two years, had
influence well beyond his job title. He was believed to be
instrumental in many government reshuffles in the past.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Yumashev began working for Yeltsin in the late
1980s. He has avoided cameras and interviews, and those who know
him say he is amiable, tough and determined. His relationship
with Yeltsin is said to be almost as close as son to father.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was hospitalized on November 22 with a temperature of
38.9 degrees and diagnosed to be suffering pneumonia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korea, DPR Korea,
Kazakhstan and host Thailand each claimed a gold medal on the
opening day of the shooting competitions at the Asian Games here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's Vladimir Guchsha won his first title in major
competition in the men's free pistol, scoring a total of 657.8
points, while South Korea's Kim Jung-Mi carried home the women's
air rifle gold.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Thailand struck gold when their sharpshooters smashed the
Asian Games record on their way to the women's air rifle team
title, whereas the men's free pistol team gold went to the DPR
Korea.
</P>
<P>
Asian shooting powerhouse China failed to beat jinx on Monday
and just got two silvers and as many bronzes.
</P>
<P>
Guchsha, 31, was all smiles after the free pistol final,
saying it needed mental strength to become a champion.
</P>
<P>
"After the qualification round I was very confident that I
would win the gold medal," said Guchsha. "During the final I lost
my confidence for a while but I quickly regained it."
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Olympic Games silver medalist Wang Yifu grabbed the
silver medal with 655.5 points while DPR Korea's Kim Jong-Su
finished third just 0.1 points behind.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who at 38 helped China win the world championship in
July, said: "I did not produce a good enough performance today. I
have been troubled with allergic problems these days so I was not
on peak form."
</P>
<P>
Another DPR Korea finalist Kim Hyon-Ung, who led Guchsha by 0.7
points before the 10th and last shot, notched a poor 5.5 points to
concede the title to Guchsha. He eventually finished fifth.

<P>
Zhao, 17, said: "I was better in the final than qualification.
I felt no pressure at all and it might be the techinical details
that mattered."
</P>
<P>
In the team event, Thailand scored 1,178 to better the Games
record of 1,172 points set by China at Beijing in 1990.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Indonesia's Reform Path Beset With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- After 32 years under the New
Order Government led by former president Soeharto, Indonesia
entered a new era of reform in mid-1998. But it seems the reform
path is beset with brambles, and most analysts say that the
success of political reform will largely depend on next year's
crucial general election.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who was elected acting president by the Provisional
People's Consultative Assembly in March 1967 and president in
March 1968, was forced to step down on May 21 and hand over the
presidency to then vice president B.J. Habibie amid the country's
worst political and economic crisis in decades.
</P>
<P>
However, the radical changes in the country were followed by
widespread social unrest. Rioting, burning and looting that broke
out in the capital city of Jakarta and some other cities in May
claimed nearly 1,300 lives and damaged over 5,000 shops and homes.
</P>
<P>
The May 13-15 riots were triggered by the killing of six
students by security persons on May 12. The students were staging
demonstrations, demanding total political, economic and legal
reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
Observers held that the turbulence not only prompted Soeharto's
downfall but also brought the crisis-hit economy to the brink of
collapse. Following the riots, most foreign investors pulled out
their capital.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the grim situation, Habibie's "Reform
Development Cabinet" pledged to speed up reforms in all fields and
keep the government free from corruption, collusion and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, under a consensus between the government and the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), a special MPR session was
convened on November 10-13, during which the five MPR factions
agreed to advance the time schedule of the next general election
from 2002 to June 7, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, in order to gain the trust of the people, the Habibie
government promised to hold a free and fair election. The
government said it will invite observers from the United Nations
Development Program, the United States, Germany, France, Japan and
Australia to see for themselves if Indonesia's general election is
held democratically.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the general session of the MPR will be held on August
28, 1999 instead of at the end of 1999. At the session the elected
MPR members will elect a new president and a vice president who
will lead Indonesia into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
As Indonesia's political tempo sped up, students continued to
take to the streets, demanding a thorough investigation into
Soeharto's allegedly ill-gotten wealth as well as abuses of power
conducted during his 32 years in power, and an end to the
military's socio-political role.
</P>
<P>
Massive student protests during the special MPR session in
November escalated into bloody clashes between the students and
security forces, in which 14 including nine students were killed.
The clashes were Jakarta's worst violence since the riots in May.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to mounting public pressure, Habibie issued a decree
on December 3 ordering Attorney General Ghalib to speed up the
investigation into Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the property of Soeharto and his family has
reached about 20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some political observers have cast doubts about the seriousness
of the government's investigation in spite of Habibie's decree.
</P>
<P>
Arbi Sanit of the University of Indonesia said if the
investigation reached the courts, there would be a devastating
backlash against the whole government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the recent bloody clashes between Muslims and
Christians have highlighted centuries-old communal splits that
some analysts warn are the greatest threat to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
with the rest belonging to Christian, Buddhist and other faiths.
</P>
<P>
At least 13 people died on November 22 in Central Jakarta
during clashes between Muslims and Christians, sparking a spate of
retaliation attacks. Fifteen mosques were burned or ransacked on
November 30 in the East Nusa Tenggara capital of Kupang. Angry
Muslim mobs on December 4 burned down a church in the South
Sulawesi capital of Ujungpandang, prompting local Christians to
flee to other regions.
</P>
<P>
Some people believe that the latest clashes, like the earlier
political bloodshed, were engineered as part of a battle between
elites seeking to advance their own agendas.
</P>
<P>
"Several groups are using the current social and economic
crisis to fuel the situation for their own political ambitions,"
said Abdurrahman Wahid, who heads the country's largest Muslim
Group Nahdlatul Ulama.
</P>
<P>
Political observers believe that the government's current
challenge is to create a system that is both democratic and stable
and allows for smooth transition of power and a strong
representative government.
</P>
<P>
As national newspapers put it, after 53 years of independence,
Indonesians deserve justice and better welfare. They have seen
enough wrongdoing of the New Order rule, and they can't afford to
see another May or November bloody incident.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian politicians have urged everybody to focus efforts on
making the reform era a reality. And next year's general election
is a crucial moment for the political future of the world's fourth
most populous country.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Opposes All Forms of Arms Race: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will continue to
oppose all forms of arms race, including nuclear arms
proliferation, President Shahabuddin Ahmed said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in the policy of good neighborly and friendly
relations and malice to none, and we oppose all aggressive
policies and activities," the president said in a speech to
officials and cadets at the Bangladesh Air Force (BAF) Academy in
Jessore, some 150 kilometers southwest of here.
</P>
<P>
The country is determined to eradicate poverty and raise the
living standards of the common people, Ahmed said. "Amid all
limitations, we have created an efficient defense system to
safeguard our sovereignty and protect dignity as a respected
nation," the official BSS news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gradual steps have been taken for modernizing the defense
system and pragmatic steps have been taken for creating a strong
and expanded air force, the president noted. He added that
sophisticated equipment would be added to the BAF and the
country's defense system would be strengthened to boost its
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Though Bangladesh is a country belonging to the Third World and
lacks sophisticated equipment, BAF pilots should receive
world-class training and have first-class theoretical knowledge,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged soldiers and officers of BAF to be ready for supreme
sacrifices for the sake of the nation.

JOHANNESBURG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- South African clothing
giant, "Mr. Price", announced Monday that it has made a
significant expansion in Namibia this year.
</P>
<P>
Three stores, two in the capital of Windhoek and one in

in northern Otjiwarongo in September and in western Walvis Bay
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Alastair Mcarthur, managing director of Speciality Stores
which owns Mr. Price and other four chain clothing stores, said
in a statement that the openings in Windhoek last weekend were
the best in the history of the Mr. Price Group.
</P>

"The downtown Windhoek store achieved a turnover of more than
250,000 Rand (about 42,000 U.S. dollars) on each of its first
three trading days," Mcarthur said.
</P>
<P>
The success in Namibia had encouraged the group to speed up
its international expansion plans for the Mr. Price brand, with
an opening program set to start in Botswana early in the new
year, he said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Police Not Hunting for Banana: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- South African police said
Monday that they were not trying to arrest Canaan Banana, the
fugitive former Zimbabwean president.
</P>
<P>
Banana, 62, was convicted of using his official position to
force members of his staff into performing homosexual acts with
him. Banana was Zimbabwean president between 1980 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe wants Banana to appear in court on Thursday when he
was to be sentenced.
</P>
<P>
However, the former president reportedly fled to Botswana and
then to South Africa shortly before the Zimbabwean High Court
found him guilty last month on 11 counts of sodomy and indecent
assault.
</P>
<P>
Homosexual is illegal in Zimbabwe, but not in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Reg Crewe, spokesman for the South African Police Service
(SAPS), told reporters that the Zimbabwean police had only asked
the South African side to locate Banana and to check whether he
had left this country.
</P>
<P>
"No warrants have been issued to apprehend Banana," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dave Bruce, executive director of Interpol in South Africa,
has also confirmed that the SAPS was not asked to apprehend
Banana, but to locate him only.
</P>
<P>
Bruce claimed that Banana has eluded after South African
President Nelson Mandela had a private meeting with him last
week. He said the police did not know Banana's identity number,
passport number or even his date of birth.
</P>
<P>
Banana's two official passports were reportedly surrendered
before he left Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Christmas Season Starts Early for Australian Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar sprung a
slow leak Monday, drifting backwards in sluggish trade as the
Christmas season took hold.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers said the quiet tone of the day
indicated the Christmas slowdown had started.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed here at 61.73 U.S. cents, after dropping
to a low of 61.55. It closed last Friday at 62.53 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
"It was very quiet today," Westpac chief foreign exchange
dealer Peter McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
"To use an oldie but a goodie - the Aussie was so quiet today
you could almost walk up and pat it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The low in the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar was
reached in early local trade and on the afternoon the domestic
currency remained around 61.70 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a really narrow range, it feels like the first
week of Christmas here," McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
The detractors for the Australian dollar have been the fall in
commodity prices and the concentration on failing emerging
markets.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Brazil also dented confidence in the
Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian real was weaker against the U.S. dollar as
speculation continued that Brazil's rescue package was on the
line.
</P>
<P>
"The market is very sensitive to any negative news from
emerging markets, Brazil in particular," McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
He said the main problem for the Australian dollar at the
moment was its failure to bounce.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the cross rates the Australian dollar was buying
73.41 Japanese yen from 73.93 and 1.0355 German marks from 1.0422.

BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- China plans to cut the cost of
rural electricity by improving rural power grids and standardizing
urban and rural costs in the next three years, a State Development
Planning Commission official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the State Council and is expected to
save farmers 18 billion yuan in costs annually for peasants.
</P>
<P>
Rural electricity costs are higher on average than urban costs
because of old rural power grids, illegal electricity fees, and
poor management.
</P>
<P>
The official says that correcting this will help peasants'
lives and agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Estrada: Let Courts Determine Mrs. Marcos' Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Monday that his government will let the courts
determine the veracity of the claim of former first lady Imelda
Marcos over 500 billion pesos (12.5 billion U.S. dollars) worth of
assets allegedly held in trust by her husband's cronies.
</P>
<P>
"She has to produce all the evidence to prove all her claims,"
President Estrada said in an ambush interview.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a newspaper report quoted Mrs. Marcos as saying her
family owns practically everything in the Philippines, "from
electricity, telecommunications, airline, banking, beer and
tobacco, newspaper publishing, television stations, shipping, oil
and mining, hotels and beach resorts, down to coconut milling,
small farms, real estate and insurance."
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Marcos claimed her husband was able to gain ownership of
100 corporations after the Laurel-Langley Treaty and the Parity
Rights granted to the Americans expired, as the constitution
limited the ownership of companies in the Philippines by
foreigners to just 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
She said among the companies immediately acquired by the late
president Ferdinand Marcos were Anchor Estate Corp., Manila
Electric Co., San Miguel Corp. and Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Co.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to this, President Estrada said, "Well, the claims of
Mrs. Marcos are all claims," adding that the evidence the former
first lady said she had has yet to verified.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, even if Mrs. Marcos can prove she owns the
companies that are now in the names of her family's cronies, she
cannot just have control over them.
</P>
<P>
The former first lady has still to prove that these were not
ill-gotten, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG)
will have to examine Mrs. Marcos' evidence and find out whether
the properties were acquired through hard-earned money, or if
they were ill-gotten wealth.
</P>
<P>
"It's up to the courts, the PCGG to determine whether that is
legitimate wealth or not," the president said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Disburses 1.4B Dollars of ODA capital in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has disbursed 1.4 billion
U.S. dollars of official development assistance (ODA) this year,
380 million dollars more than last year, Vietnam News Agency (VNA)
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
This means 4.8 billion dollars of ODA, or 44 percent of the
total ODA committed for Vietnam in the 1993-1997 period, has been
disbursed so far in the country, VNA said.
</P>
<P>
About 20 nations, 15 international organizations and 300
non-governmental organizations pledged a combined 10.8 billion
U.S. dollars of ODA for Vietnam through five donors' conferences
held from 1993-1997.
</P>
<P>
Ten percent of the sum is in the form of aid, and the rest soft
loans.
</P>
<P>
The largest share of ODA flows in socio-economic
infrastructural development, especially in the sectors of power,
land roads, irrigation, education and training, health care and
environment.
</P>
<P>
The sixth conference of ODA donors for Vietnam is to open in
Paris Monday (December 7).
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference will focus on agricultural and rural
development and hunger eradication and poverty alleviation in
Vietnam, VNA quoted Minister of Planning and Investment Tran Xuan
Gia who now is in Paris as saying.
</P>
<P>
ODA flow into Vietnam will decrease, the minister said.
However, he stressed that ODA commitment to Vietnam is not only a
source of material assistance but also the international
community's acceptance of Vietnam's policy, thus the commitments
themselves bear a higher value than their value in money.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government financial
institutions may have to rescue the financially-troubled
Philippine Airlines (PAL) even though they are not willing to do
so, an official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu told reporters that
government financial institutions may have to provide some bridge
financing for PAL to pay off its lease and rental payments for
some aircraft and to the U.S. Export-Import Bank.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, these institutions may only agree to provide
the bridge financing if PAL continues negotiations with Cathay
Pacific Airways or some other strategic partners.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said that negotiations between PAL and Cathay are
continuing with the possible entry of Singapore Airlines as an
option.
</P>
<P>
PAL is submitting a rehabilitation plan that would include a
new partner, whose name has not been revealed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Joseph Estrada told reporters here Monday
that he expects to meet again officials of Cathay Pacific this
week to discuss its possible buy into PAL.
</P>
<P>
But he said that he is not considering a government takeover of
PAL.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he remains hopeful that a solution will surface
soon to keep PAL flying.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Investment
Funds Association (HKIFA) said Monday that the unit trust
industry saw a net inflow of 45.58 million U.S. dollars in October,
up by 48.8 percent over September's inflow of 30.64 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The key reason for the robust inflow in October was strong
investor interest in bond funds, said a press release issued by
HKIFA on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bond sector attracted new money of 69.97 million U.S.
dollars in October, representing 70 percent of its gross inflows.
</P>
<P>
As to why bond funds were so popular, Desmond Chan, chairman of
 the HKIFA, said that since the outbreak of the Asian currency
crisis last year, it seems that investors have in general found
bonds more attractive than equities, especially on a risk and
return basis.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Says Will Not Change Plan to Visit Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen said Monday that he would not change his plan to visit Vietnam
no matter whether the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) would accept Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the remarks while meeting with Vietnam's new
Ambassador to Cambodia Nguyen Duy Hung. Hun Sen is set to fly to
Hanoi on December 13 to pay a two-day official visit to Vietnam at
the invitation of his counterpart Phan Van Khai. This will be Hun
Sen's first official visit abroad since he became Cambodia's new
premier on November 30.
</P>
<P>
"I will visit Hanoi on December 13 and 14. Then on December 15
and 16, I will participate in the ASEAN summit meeting or just
meet with the leaders of ASEAN countries and its dialogue
partners," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
On Cambodia's entry into ASEAN, he said, "In order to join the
ASEAN, Cambodia has made a lot of efforts, including (that) King
Norodom Sihanouk sent separate letters to each leader of the nine
ASEAN countries on December 2 to urge them to accept Cambodia as a
full member of the regional grouping at its December 15-16 meeting
in Hanoi."
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Duy Hung said that Vietnam will do its best to support
Cambodia to become an official member of ASEAN before or during
the ASEAN summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen also hinted that even if Cambodia is not admitted, he
is also possible to participate in the summit as an observer.
"There is still time to make ASEAN accept Cambodia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Hor Nam Hong, Cambodia's new foreign minister, told
reporters that if Cambodia is not admitted before the summit, the
premier will return home, and Cambodia will instead send a senior
government official to the summit as observer.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, whose entry into ASEAN was postponed after the July
1997 factional fighting, is eager to join the regional group. It
is the only Southeast Asian nation that is not a member of the
grouping.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Vietnam, Hun Sen said, he will meet with
the Vietnamese prime minister, the head of the state and other
government leaders to discuss bilateral ties, border issues, oil
rights in territorial waters and cooperation in tourism and so on.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cambodia's new coalition government has won approval
from the United Nations Credentials Committee to retake the
country's seat at the U.N. General Assembly, and is expected to
return to full membership soon.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the U.N. recognition will help Cambodia's
drive to join ASEAN and attract foreign aid suspended after last
year's political crisis.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Fires Top Aids After Returning to Kremlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Monday fired Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev, his spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted an administration official as saying that
Nikolai Bordyuzha, secretary of the Russian Security Council, will
replace Yumashev.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given by the Kremlin for Yumashev's removal, but
the former correspondent was said to have asked for resignation
for some time.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin returned to the Kremlin earlier Monday after a 15-day
stay in the Central Clinical Hospital where he was treated for
pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
Yumashev's deputies Yuri Yarov, Mikhail Komissar and Yevgeny
Savostyanov were also dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Yumashev, who had influence well beyond his job title, was
believed to be instrumental in many government reshuffles in the
past, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Yumashev, a rumpled, 40-year-old ex-journalist, began working
for Yeltsin in the late 1980s. He avoids cameras and interviews,
and those who know him said he is amiable, tough and
determined. His relationship with Yeltsin is said to be almost as
close as son to father.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Yumashev's departure, former Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin said the move reflects "stagnation and lack of
initiative on the part of the presidential team."
</P>
<P>
He said that Yeltsin's decision is obviously "correct" and "is
expected to give a new impetus to the work of the presidential
administration," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, who said Yumashev will "remain on Yeltsin's
team," noted that by taking this decision "Yeltsin has
demonstrated that he intends to serve out his term until the year
2000."

<HEADLINE> Philippines Health Procurement Goes Internet for Scrutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Department of Health of the
Philippines will soon publish its procurement information on the
Internet for public scrutiny, Alberto G. Romualdez Jr., Secretary
of Health, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez told a regular press briefing that installing such
information in the department's web page is one of the features of
the department's revised procurement system, designed to prevent
alleged graft and corruption practices.
</P>
<P>
"The press," Romualdez added, "should have access to all
transactions (of the department) and if you notice anything
(questionable) that you don't like, you can report it to us or
have them published in your newspapers."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the regional health offices are required to submit
copies of the bidding results to the central office to identify
gross mistakes, Romualdez said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the department purchases one billion pesos
(25 million U.S. dollars) worth of drugs and medicines yearly,
with its central office procuring 500 million pesos (12.5 million
U.S. dollars).

MANILA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate has
ratified the World Trade Organizations (WTO) Information
Technology (Infotech) Agreement which would phase out tariffs on
infotech products by year 2000, the Philippines News Agency said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was ratified by a vote of 19-3, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Its ratification enrolls the Philippines in the camp of 50 WTO
members which have similarly acceded to the accord, and which
together account for 92.5 percent of the total trade in the
information technology industry, it said.
</P>
<P>
Senator Blas Ople, who pushed the ratification, said the Senate
approval will enable the Philippine semi-conductor industry to
acquire more advanced equipment and be more globally competitive.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was initially tabled at the Asian-Pacific
Economic Cooperation meetings but the United States elevated it to
the WTO to make it binding on most of WTO signatory members.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Egyptian
Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) Hafez Abu Saada has been set
free on bail, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Higher State Security Court ordered the release of Abu
Saada Sunday on 500 Egyptian pounds (147 U.S. dollars) bail, the
English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution, meanwhile, ordered the arrest of EOHR's
lawyer, Moustafa Zeidan, who prepared a report alleging police
brutality against Coptic Christians in southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Abu Saada was detained last Wednesday on charges of accepting
foreign funds for disseminating allegations detrimental to Egypt's
national interests.
</P>
<P>
The private Al Usbou weekly newspaper said last month that EOHR
had received 25,000 dollars offered by Britain after it compiled a
report claiming that more than 1,000 Copts in Egypt were rounded
up and persecuted by police in Suhag Governorate's Kosheh village.
</P>
<P>
EOHR denied the money had any connection with that report,
issued in September.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that based on the EOHR report, Britain's
Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported that "Egyptian Christians have
been subejected to horrific crucification rituals, raped and
tortured by the security forces during a crackdown on the ancient
Coptic community."
</P>
<P>
Egypt's parliament, social groups and celebrities have
denounced the story of the British newspaper as a fabrication
aimed at defaming Egypt.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Muslim majority and Christian minority have
been co-existing in peace for more than 14 centuries in the
country.

TOKYO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo

<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
today the issue of China's reunification should not be postponed
indefinitely and urged Taiwan authorities to open cross-Straits
political talks at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kehui, vice chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said
Taiwan should value the progress achieved during the recent
meeting between Wang Daohan and Koo Chenfu, and should "join hands
in striving for the realization of the reunification."
</P>
<P>
Zhang made the comments at a recent forum sponsored by the
All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots and the Central
Committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League (TDSGL)
to mark the 20th anniversary of the Third Plenary Session of the
11th Communist Party of China Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said participants in the forum decided on the general
principle of solving the Taiwan issue through peaceful means. He
added that the mainland has worked out a series of related
policies over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, chairman of the TDSGL Central Committee, reviewed the
mainland's reunification endeavors and growing trade,
cultural and personnel across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
He said the vast majority of Taiwan compatriots hope to
maintain the status quo. "Most Taiwan compatriots think the 'one
country, two systems' principle provides the best solution."
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the TDSGL is perfectly willing to work with
Taiwan compatriots to achieve reunification.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic Committee
president Juan Antonio Samaranch on Monday acknoledged China's
seriousness in its fight against doping in sports.
</P>
<P>
"I will say that maybe China is one of the countries fighting
with all its strength against doping -- and that is quite
important for the IOC," said Samaranch in a press conference on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I think today the fight against doping in China is an
example for us all."
</P>
<P>
Talking about the 2008 Olympic candidates, the president said
he encouraged all the cities to bid for the Games.
</P>
<P>
"My role is to encourage as many candidates as possible," he
said. "If I'm in China, I'll encourage China. If I'm in Japan,
I'll encourage Japan, and if it's Malaysia, I'll encourage them."
</P>
<P>
Beijing, Japanese city Osaka and Malaysian capital Kuala
Lumpur have expressed interest in hosting the 2008 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
In the press conference, Samaranch also said it was too late
for Poland and Slovakia to submit a joint bid to stage the 2006
Winter Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch expressed full support for the structure of
Sydney's Olympics Organizing Committee after a new Australian
political leader demanded change.
</P>
<P>
Kerry Chikarovski, who replaced Peter Collins as leader of
the New South Wales opposition party Monday, said she wanted the
roles of committee president and state government's Olympic
Minister to be seperated.
</P>
<P>
Michael Knight of Labor Party has both jobs but his fate will
be decided in a state election in March.
</P>
<P>
"It's up to them but if they ask me for advice I would like
them to hold the same format as there is now," Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
"This closeness we have now through the government and the
organizing committee through Minister Knight is a very good one.
</P>
<P>
"These days, for the success of the games, the organizing
committee must be very, very close to the government. This
solution you have in Sydney I support 100 percent."

BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese table tennis head coach
Cai Zhenhua said on Monday that South Korea and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea were China's arch rivals in the Asian
Games.
</P>
<P>
"In either men's or women's event, South Korea and DPR Korea
are two forces to reckon with," said Cai.

<P>
In the women's competitions, Chinese Taipei are the other team
who may upset Cai's students, the Chinese coach added.
</P>
<P>
Cai, who watched the DPR Koreans' training on Monday, said they
would give more troubles to China than the South Koreans would.
</P>
<P>
"We are very familiar with the South Korean style, but DPR
Korea have rarely made international appearance and we don't have
special tactics against them," Cai said.
</P>
<P>
Cai said the Chinese players had to accustom themselves to
air-conditioning in the court as well as to the made-in-Japan ball
which felt softer than the one Chinese used to play with.

<HEADLINE> Burundian Refugees Fined for Free Travel in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 7 (Xinhua) - A total of 176 Burundian
refugees at Lukole camp in northwestern Tanzania's Kagera Region
have been fined 50,000 Shillings (about 73 US Dollars) each or
six-month imprisonment for leaving their camp.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Home Affairs Ministry confirmed a press
report here Monday, saying that 50 others have been sentenced 20
strikes of the cane by the Bukoba district court for attempting
to escape from their camp.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Kagera Regional Police Commander Eliyuko
Elihaki as saying that all the 226 refugees were netted in a
police swoop on November 30 when they were on their way to the
Nduta refugee camp in three trucks.
</P>
<P>
"They were apparently going to join other refugees from
Burundi in Kigoma region," Elihaki said.
</P>
<P>
The Commander said the fleeing refugees were returned to
Bukoba last Monday where all pleaded guilty to two separate
counts before Resident Magistrate R.M. Ruhasha.
</P>
<P>
The refugees were accused of conspiracy and violation of the
Tanzanian Refugees Act approved recently for restricting free
movement from camps in a way to keep local society in order.
</P>
<P>
"We have sent them back to Lukole camp. The court has given
them six months to pay the fine, failing which they would be
jailed for six months each," Elihaki said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Tanzanian drivers of the trucks pleaded
guilty to colluding with the refugees and were jailed for 18
months each.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that by the end of last week, a total of
20,000 refugees from the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) and Burundi have so far entered Tanzania since a bloody
crisis broke out in DRC early August.
</P>
<P>
Among them are 15,619 refugees from the DRC and 3,846 from
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Their arrivals have brought the grand total refugees from the
two countries currently in the refugee camps in western Tanzania
to 236,425.

with 21 sites listed on UNESCO's list of World Heritages,
including the Summer Palace and the Temple of Heaven.
</P>
<P>
China applied for World Heritage status for its most famous
imperial park and largest sacrificial temple in June of
1998. UNESCO's World Heritage Committee has since added the
palace, a 290-ha. part of the emperors of the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1011) after 1888, and the temple which covers some 2.7
million square meters to the list of World Heritages.
</P>
<P>
The two sites attract millions of visitors from both home and
abroad each year.
</P>
<P>
The logo for China's tourism department depicts the Hall of
Prayer for Good Harvests in the Temple of Heaven.
</P>
<P>
"People worldwide will treasure the Temple of Heaven even more
and will provide more effective protection since the complex was
added to the list," according to Lou Lianju, director of the
temple's Administrative Office.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of European and American visitors to the
temple increased dramatically during the application process.
</P>
<P>
Lou and his colleagues are determined to restore the ancient
appearance of the altar as part of an extensive long-term
protection project.
</P>
<P>
The World Heritage Committee, established in 1976, requires the
preservation of the original features of both cultural and natural
sites, and has established special funds for protection
projects.

Cultural sites are required to have historic, artistic,
archeological, scientific and anthropological value, while natural
sites must offer distinct ecological and geographical features.
</P>
<P>
The Convention on the Protection of World Cultural and Natural
Heritages, which UNESCO adopted in 1972, requires all contracting
members to fully preserve and safeguard listed sites which are
defined as safe areas during times of war.
</P>
<P>
A total of 582 cultural and natural sites worldwide are
included on the list of World Heritages.
</P>
<P>
The committee acts in accordance with the convention and not
only provides both financial and administrative services to
countries will relates sites, but also conducts preservation
research.
</P>
<P>
China joined the convention in 1985 and filed application for
World Heritages the following year. Six Chinese sites were added
to to the list in 1987 -- Mount Taishan in east Shandong Province;
the Great Wall and the Palace Museum in Beijing; the Mogao
Grottos in Dunhuang, Gansu Province; the Tomb of Qinshihuang in
Xi'an; and the Peking Man site near Zhoukoudian in southwest
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet, as well the Lushan Mountains
in Jiangxi Province, the city gardens in Suzhou in Jiangsu
Province, and the ancient town of Lijiang in Yunnan Province are
also on the list.
</P>
<P>
China submits a limited number of applications each year, and
priority currently focuses on gaining a listing for Wuyi Mountains
in Fujian Province.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for Efforts to Monitor Somali Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has called
for support and co-operation from the international community in
monitoring Somali coastline following reports of toxic dumping,
piracy and illegal fishing there.
</P>
<P>
The call followed a statement by Captain Edward Johns Jr, who
is heading a U.N. Conference on Trade and Development project to
rehabilitate the northern Somali ports of Bossaso and Bersseba,
the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The risk of oil pollution, given the volume of traffic around
the Horn of Africa, was high and possible repercussions great, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Johns noted that illegal fishing was another source of major
concern in the Horn of Africa and required close attention from
the international community as well.
</P>
<P>
Tuna stocks in the region, especially around the northern
Somali coast, were substantial, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We know that reputable and disreputable fishing concerns are
fishing in this region, paying no license fees, taking fish and
simply leaving the Somali coast," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that there is no internationally recognized state
governing this region should not stop the international community
from intervening," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that the administrations emerging along the
Somali coast had realized the gravity of the problem and felt
they should act.

<HEADLINE> Auto Computers on Sale in U.S. Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 6 (Xinhua) -- AutoPC, a computer inside
cars put out by a California-based car radio maker, went on sale
at some stores in Seattle, San Diego and San Francisco this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Clarion Corp., the AutoPC maker, demonstrated the device in a
bright yellow, convertible Mercedes, while explaining AutoPC
functions in detail on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
The computer runs Microsoft's Windows CE, a version of Windows
for handheld PCs and consumer electronics devices, as its
operating system and slides into the car-radio slot.
</P>
<P>
According to Clarion, the computer integrates car audio,
computing functions, navigation and wireless communications
through hand-free voice activation within the dash of a car.
</P>
<P>
The unit recognizes over 200 voice commands and with its
text-to-speech application, reads e-mail and provides other
information such as turn-by-turn directions and status
information, weather reports, traffic alerts and assistance all
via "speech synthesis."
</P>
<P>
While the functions may be useful to a long-distance driver,
the price of the system is not cheap. To get the full package, a
user will have to spend between 2,200 and 2,500 U.S. dollars. The
basic AutoPC, containing voice-activated radio and mapping
capabilities, also cost about 1,300 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Observers worry the device will cause the users to take their
eyes off the road, but according to the maker, the device may
actually make driving safer by providing directions when a user is
lost. In addition, the driver will never have to take his hands
off the wheel.
</P>
<P>
ZD Net News, an Internet news medium, quoted Microsoft
officials as saying that an updated version of the car computer is
due out next year. Future versions of Microsoft and other software
developers will contain more features, such as monitoring a car's
engine, and connecting to sensors in a car's bumper that will tell
drivers the safe distance behind them.

<HEADLINE> 10 Million S. Africans Registered for General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- About 40 percent of South
Africa's estimated 25 million potential voters might have
registered for next year's general election by Sunday, according
to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC).
</P>
<P>
More data are coming in and the exact number could only be
known later this week.
</P>
<P>
The IEC found that more women (3.2 million) than men (2.5
million) had enrolled.
</P>
<P>
It also found that there was a high degree of apathy among
young voters. In the 16 to 18 age group, about half of whom
would be eligible to vote by next year, only about 2.3 percent
had registered.
</P>
<P>
The highest registration rate (33.9 percent) was among the 70
to 80 age group.
</P>
<P>
Those who have not registered would be given a second chance
early next year. The dates will be announced this week.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Auction Bowling Alleys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 bowling alleys under
construction in Shanghai will go on the auction block due to
slumping business.
</P>
<P>
Fan Ganping, a representative of the Shanghai International
Commodity Auction Co. Ltd., said the properties up for auction
feature equipment and lanes manufactured by U.S.-based Brunswick
in 1996. The auction will be held in the middle of December.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly rising popularity of bowling over the past few
years led to an overheated market and ill-advised investments in
related facilities.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly expanding forms of entertainment available to
Shanghainese led to a downturn in bowling enthusiasm and forced
related businesses to reduce prices.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Community Urged to Invest in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has urged U.S. business community to invest
in Nigeria as the country is rich in resources and manpower.
</P>
<P>
The head of state made the remarks when he received the
visiting United States Commerce Secretary, William Daley, who
arrived in Nigerian capital Abuja on Sunday, the Daily Times
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that democracy had come to stay in the country
following the impressive conduct of Saturday's local government
elections, adding that "It (democracy) will stay."
</P>
<P>
Daley said he is visiting Nigeria at a key moment in the
country's history, adding "the world is waiting for Nigeria to
emerge as a potential trading partner".
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, the U.S. secretary said his message to
the Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar was that "if
Nigeria keeps on the path of reform, American companies will be
there to help you build a market-based democracy."
</P>
<P>
Daley told American and Nigerian business communities that
"there has to be real commitment from the Nigerian leaders to
make this economy attractive for long-term trade and investment."
</P>
<P>
According to him, many U.S. companies have strong ties with
the west African country and they want to build on the basis of
those ties if the climate is right.
</P>
<P>
Daley urged Nigeria to adopt a fully convertible currency with
a single market-determined exchange rate, so that investment can
flow unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
Noting the recent changes taking place in the most populous
African country, Daley said the U.S. would like to see real
progress on the privatization of public-owned enterprises in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to hearing more about privatizing
government-run businesses, including electric power,
telecommunications and fertilizer production," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Nigeria must co-operate on the controlling of
drug trafficking and reduction in crime rate in order "to regain
access to the U.S. government and international financing".

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Target Tariff Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Most members of the Common
Market for the Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) will be ready
to effect a 90-percent tariff reduction by 1999 in the ongoing
run-up to the implementation of a free trade zone by 2000.
</P>
<P>
A document adopted here by the sixth meeting of the COMESA
inter-governmental committee said many member countries have
submitted details of areas where they need to remove tariff
barriers.
</P>
<P>
Up to date the members have effected various levels of tariff
reduction rates ranging from 60 to 80 percent, the ultimate
target is for all the members to achieve zero-rate tariffs by
2000.
</P>
<P>
The process is ongoing and requires continuous consultation
due to the complicated nature of the subject matter.
</P>
<P>
The inter-government committee has also recommended that the
African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP) should give
assistance to COMESA members in the coordination of negotiations
for a post Lome IV trade and cooperation status with European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The current phase of the Lome convention, which is the fourth
in the series, ends in February 2000.
</P>
<P>
COMESA members are keen to negotiate for conducive
arrangements in the future relations between the EU and ACP
countries which will help their relatively weaker countries in a
market dictated competition for trade opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Police Seize Fake Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 7 (Xinhua) -- In one of the biggest round-up
operations in Lebanon's history, the police have netted a gang of
counterfeiters and seized some 5 million U.S. dollars in fake
currency, the Daily Star reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
After a car chase in which two police corporals sustained minor
injuries, three men were arrested in downtown Beirut Sunday and 5
million worth of freshly-printed counterfeit dollars were
confiscated, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese national Abdel Nasser Hanafi, 28, Nigeria Charles
Odiri, 26, and Lebanese Ibrahim Ali Khaled, 33, were taken into
custody for allegedly planning to use the fake money.
</P>
<P>
However, the alleged American mastermind of the gang,
Chicago-born Tony Scott, 36, managed to escape from the West
House hotel in Beirut where the film negatives used for
counterfeiting process were found, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
The film negatives had an 80 percent accuracy capacity, the
highest one ever discovered in Lebanon's counterfeit industry,
said the police sources.
</P>
<P>
The counterfeit notes had reportedly been shown to the
country's most experienced money exchangers who could not detect
any difference from legal tender notes.
</P>
<P>
U.S. experts in counter-terrorism are expected to arrive
Monday from Cyprus to examine the notes and help in the
investigations, as part of a bilateral agreement to fight
terrorism between Lebanon and the United States.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai Airways International
(THAI) has won the government support for switching plans to lease
aircraft to buying new ones, airline sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The airways' proposal to buy two Boeing jumbos worth 282.21
million U.S. dollars has been approved by the cabinet, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
THAI had previously relied on leasing aircraft for its
operations. It changed the policy after reasoning that leasing
would be more costly in the long run.
</P>
<P>
Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thueksuban said
THAI has the power to decide whether to go ahead with its purchase
plans since the cabinet has approved the new procurement plan.
</P>
<P>
THAI management suggested that a plan to lease the 149.23
million U.S. dollar Boeing 747-400 and a 132.98 million dollar
Boeing 777-300 be switched back to an original plan to buy the
planes as, in the long run, leasing would be more costly.
</P>
<P>
Transport and Communications secretary general Mahidol
Chantrangkoon, in his capacity as THAI board chairman, said he had
ordered THAI management to explain the change in writing.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet considered the purchase proposal which was
submitted to the cabinet by both the finance and transport
ministries. The Finance Ministry is THAI's largest shareholder.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Stock Market Dips This year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' stock market
dipped to 875.4 billion pesos (21.88 billion dollars) in October
from 2,346.0 billion pesos (58.65 billion U.S. dollars) in January
1997 due to weak confidence of foreign investors, the Philippine
News Agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert G. Garchitorena, a professor of economics at the
University of Asia and the Pacific, was quoted by the agency as
saying that the turbulence in the Philippine equities market is
its heavy reliance on foreign investments to fuel an upsurge in
stock prices and volume turnover.
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the fall from January 1997 to October 1998 was
the property and financial sectors of the equities market which
performed poorly, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that this was due to continued fears of a glut in the
real estate sector and the weakness of the banks' balance sheets,
thus resulting in a shrink of the banks' index and the financial
services index by 46.0 percent and 34.3 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to the decline was the oil index which posted
a 45.5 percent drop in the same period, Garchitorena said.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, he said, the drop in the Phisix index led to the
decline of the average daily value turnover from 2.7 million pesos
(67,500 dollars) in 1996 to a dismal 1.5 million pesos (37,500
dollars) in the first nine months of 1998.

maintains an average monthly increase of 0.6 percent through the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks at the 1998 Cooperative Economic and
Trade Meeting of National Township Enterprises held in Zhumadian
Prefecture, central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin praised the role township enterprises
play in national economy and urged localities to pay greater
attention to the sector's development during an April visit to
Jiangsu Province. Governments departments at all levels have since
increased policy-making and funding efforts to support township
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Related enterprises are also benefiting from government
policies designed to stimulate the economy by increasing funding
for infrastructure, expanding domestic demand and exploring rural
markets. For example, investments of some 100 billion yuan (12.5
billion US dollars) in infrastructure have helped produce some 60
percent of the total output value for township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China's massive efforts to eliminate smuggling and
encourage foreign trade have helped increase the export volume for
township enterprises. Statistics show that township enterprises
enjoyed a 10.7-percent rise in exports for the January-October
period.
</P>
<P>
Increased investments in science and technology, as well as in
technological upgrading, have also helped maintain the high growth
rate for township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises, the brainchild of Chinese farmers, have
not only played a leading role in the rural economy, but accounted
for increasing contributions to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture statistics indicate that a three to
four percentage points rise or fall in the growth rate for
township enterprises will result in a one percentage point change
in the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more importantly, however, is the fact that
China's 24 million township enterprises employ 130 million rural
laborers, or close to half of the surplus rural labor force.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 growth rate for township enterprises is expected to be
set at 15 percent to help them improve industrial structure and
product mix for better performance in the future, according to
Jiang.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Falls in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- India's annual rate of
inflation fell to 8.13 percent for the week ended November 21, a
sharp fall for the second successive week.
</P>
<P>
As the growth rate in the prices of food articles continued to
ease, the inflation rate, based on wholesale price index, fell by
0.41 percent in the week following a decline of 0.31 percent to
8.54 percent in the previous week, the Times of India reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the daily said, this decline in the overall index did
not indicate any drastic drop in prices of food articles but only
mean that the sustained increase in prices had abated.
</P>
<P>
Inflation based on consumer price index for industrial workers
was running at a huge 18.6 percent in October compared to 16.3
percent in September.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the inflation rate based on the final index for the
week ended September 26, the latest available, stood at 8.8
percent and the final index for all commodities for the week stood
at 357.1 compared to the provisional figure of 356.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the current week, indices of primary articles and
manufactured articles decline due mainly to an easing of price
rise in food articles and food products.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Bill Threatens Kenya's Health Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's expenditure on caring
for AIDS patients is soaring dramatically and will equal about
half of the entire public health budget by the year 2000,
according to a top-level anti-AIDS project.
</P>
<P>
The total hospital costs for AIDS care will amount to some 63
million U.S. Dollars by 2000, and to 90 million Dollars by 2005,
the National AIDS and STDs Control Program (NASCOP) warned.
</P>
<P>
The total direct and indirect costs of AIDS is also shooting
up from about two to four percent of the gross domestic product
in 1991 to 15 percent at the turn of the century, the East
African weekly quoted a new NASCOP report as saying.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1.5 million people in Kenya, about nine percent
of the total population, are currently infected with the HIV
virus which can cause the vital AIDS. It is predicted that the
number will be 1.8 million by 2000 and 2.1 million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the AIDS patients will occupy more than 50
percent of all hospital beds in the country.
</P>
<P>
The first AIDS case was detected in the east African country
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
These figures are based on the country's HIV sentinel
surveillance program, which operates in 13 urban and 11 rural
sites around the country.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Claims Environmental Damage by Iraqi Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait has claimed over 16 billion U.S. dollars in environmental
damages to Kuwait, a local newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Al-Anba newspaper, Adel Asem,
deputy chairman of the public authority for assessment of
compensations for damages resulting from the Iraqi invasion, said
even this figure "was not final."
</P>
<P>
This was "because a large portion of the environmental claims
primarily depends on results of long and thorough studies and
researches," Asem said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kuwait would present at the end of next February
two types of claims to the United Nations Compensations Commission
(UNCC) including mines eradication from the deserts and researches
and studies claims.
</P>
<P>
The UNCC attaches great importance to environmental claims,
Asem said, and added that Iraqi invasion also caused environmental
damages to the neighboring countries of both Kuwait and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia was severely hit by the oil leakage into its
coast, he said, anticipating its environmental claims to be very
high.
</P>
<P>
Asem said that Iran's coast was also inflicted great damages
due to the impact of smokes of Kuwait's burning oil wells which
had covered a large part of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Other countries in the region including Jordan and Syria have
also presented their claims to the UNCC as they suffered acid
rains which brought tremendous impact on their environment, Asem
added.

WASHINGTON -- Astronauts aboard the space shuttle Endeavor
Sunday successfully connected the first two elements for the
international space station.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the two elements -- Zarya built by
Russia and put into space on November 20 and Unity built by NASA
-- to be docked 240 miles above the Earth, and thus paved the way
for the next 5 years' assembly of the international space
station. The two station pieces are very big -- 77 feet from the
tip of one to the tip of the other with a total mass of 70,000
pounds, like a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay.

European Union, if the international community pledges to take
concrete steps to resolve the Kurdish issue.

<P>
Ocalan told Italian news agency ANSA that an Italian-backed
proposal for him to be tried in an international court would be
the best possible solution. Ocalan was arrested by Italy after
flying into Rome from Moscow on November 12. As the leader of
Kurdistan Worker Party, he is Turkey's most wanted man. Italy's
rejection over Turkish demands for his extradition has caused a
crisis in relations between the two countries. (Italy-Ocalan-Trial)

The Jerusalem Post
</P>
<P>
-- The United States suggested holding a three-way summit next
week among U.S. President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat, U.S. official said on Sunday.

Both Israeli and Palestinian sides have expressed willingness
to attend the meeting, which is tentatively scheduled to take

<P>
-- Israel is having second thoughts about U.S. President Bill
Clinton's visit to Israel and Gaza over the weekend, a plan made
at the Wye summit in October.

Israeli officials are worried that a Clinton visit could
enhance Palestinian claims to statehood, and pressure Israel to
give up more territory to the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a Clinton visit during the cabinet meeting on
Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu simply said "if
he wants to come, he should come. If he does not want to come, he
should not come."

<HEADLINE> Yi Ethnic Group in the Midst of Change (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Editor's Note: This is the
eighth of a series of stories featuring the fast-changing life and
culture of the Zhuang, Yi, Miao, Yao and other seven main ethnic
groups in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which
will mark its 40th founding anniversary on December 11.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Yi ethnic group were living a primitive tribal
society when Red Army Commander Liu Bocheng and a Yi chieftain
reached an agreement enabling the former's forces to pass through
the area on the historic Long March (1934-35).
</P>
<P>
Life of the Yi, an ethnic group which lives mainly in the
Daliang and Xiaoliang mountains in Sichuan Province, as well as in
Guangxi and Yunnan Province, has changed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
De'e Township in northwestern Guangxi is home to over 1,600 Yi
people. Chieftains no longer rule and Huang Wenli, a member of the
Yi group and deputy Party secretary in De'e, is the
highest-ranking official in the township.
</P>
<P>
The Yi represent a minority in the township inhabited by members
of other ethnic groups including the Miao, Gelao, Han and Zhuang,
and the number of the Miao people alone is more than 10,000.
</P>
<P>
Former customs prohibited intermarriages between members of the
Yi and Miao. Today, however, the older generation accepts
intermarriages based on mutual affection.
</P>
<P>
Huang married his wife, a member of the Gelao ethnic group, in
1986.
</P>
<P>
"We were the first couple in the township to receive a marriage
certificate," said Huang, adding that "few people in local ethnic
areas registered for marriage at that time, and most simply opted
to live together.
</P>
<P>
"Registering is more appropriate, and offers certain advantages
in case of future disputes."

<P>
The township now requires villagers to register for marriage in
accordance with the Marriage Law, said Huang.
</P>
<P>
A number of old Yi marriage customs have in fact been
abandoned. For example, male cousins, regardless of how poor, had
priority when it came to marrying female cousins. However, the
custom of marriage between cousins was abandoned a number of years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The Yi continue to celebrate the traditional Torch Festival set
on June 24 every year according to the Lunar Calendar. Members of
the ethnic group burn torches for three days and nights to drive
away insects the legendary "King of Heaven" sent to eat crops.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yi villagers also sacrifice pigs and cows during
memorial ceremonies for their ancestors. In the evening, they walk
around their fields with torches, and gather around bonfires to
sing, dance and play musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
Li Jingxing, a Yi farmer in De'e Township, said members of the
ethnic group living in Guangxi can only speak the Yi language. He
added that the written language has virtually disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed hope that members of the group living Sichuan and
Yunnan will help Guangxi's Yi recover the written language.
</P>
<P>
"While it's convenient to use Putonghua (the standard Chinese
language), we still want to retain our ethnic language," said Li.
</P>
<P>
The unique folklore in De'e Township has attracted the
attention of artists from the United States, Thailand, Hong Kong
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Huang's greatest ambition is to construct an asphalt road
linking the township with the outside world. He pointed out that
"a road will enable us to develop tourism."

<HEADLINE> Death Fear Grows as Arsonist Hits Wellington Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Suspicious fires in
Wellington,
the capital of New Zealand, have been increased to 21 since
mid-September
and fear heightened that a serial arsonist may be just a step away
from
killing someone.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported Monday that there were another two
suspicious
fires in central Wellington Sunday, one at a house and another at
a hall.
</P>
<P>
Wellington district police manager Gerry Cunneen said that
despite
extensive investigations police are "sadly no closer to catching
the
arsonist than they were two weeks ago."
</P>
<P>
"We have no idea whether this is a male, female, child or
adult.
There's been no physical profile presented to us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Police said that it was lucky that the sole occupant of the
house was
awake watching videos about three o'clock a.m. when she smelt
smoke
coming from the lower area of her two-storeyed home.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-September, Wellington has seen a spate of suspicious
fires,
mostly at wooden homes and often in the early hours.
</P>
<P>
On November 7, an arsonist with low intelligence was caught in
Upper
Hutt, a district under Wellington administration. But he was later

confirmed to have nothing to do with the spate of fires in
central
Wellington.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Wellington police urged local residents to come
forward
with information as a potentially life-threatening arsonist
continued to
elude them. A team composed of detectives has been concentrating
on the
case and all police resources are available to it.
</P>
<P>
Cunneen said police fears are growing that "someone would be
seriously injured or killed" as the spate of arsons continues.
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to tell if the arsonist is deliberately
setting out
to kill someone, he added.
</P>
<P>
He urged local people to remain "calm but vigilant" and report
"any
signs of suspicious activity".

<HEADLINE> Athletics Canada Say No to Disgraced Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada's athletics federation
has refused to reinstate disgraced sprinter Ben Johnson,
disqualified for doping after winning the 100 meters at the 1988
Seoul Olympics, according to Sunday's Toronto Sun.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Athletics Canada, which examined the athlete's
request at its general assembly on Saturday at Ottawa, did not
see a reason to welcome him back into the field until all
possible appeal avenues had been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to do anything above and beyond what we think
is the best system in the world, one that's fair and equitable to
all athletes," said Athletics Canada president Rolf Lund.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 36, has not competed professionally since the IAAF
handed him a life suspension in 1993 after he returned two
positive tests - first when being stripped of his 1988 gold medal
and then five years later after a meeting in Montreal.

<HEADLINE> Household Savings Slump in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Household savings in New
Zealand
slumped by 800 million NZ dollars (424 million U.S. dollars) in
the third
quarter this year, The Dominion reported Monday while quoting the
latest
EquitiLink savings indicator.
</P>
<P>
EquitiLink is an independent managed investment company with
6.5
billion NZ dollars (3.45 billion U.S. dollars) under management
around
the world.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted EquitiLink as saying that
the
widely-predicted increase in household savings this year is not
happening.
</P>
<P>
The July tax cuts, share giveaways and economic recession have
not
encouraged people to save more, EquitiLink said.
</P>
<P>
Savings declined one percent with 800 million NZ dollars wiped
off the
savings pool in the third quarter, taking the index down to
120.28, the
same level as a year ago, it added.
</P>
<P>
The index measures savings in both short- and long-term
financial
assets.
</P>
<P>
According to EquitiLink, the fall in the household pool of
savings
followed two quarters where savings remained static.
</P>
<P>
Savings in bank deposits rose 0.3 percent but the managed funds

sector fell by 2.5 percent, the sharpest drop in three years.
</P>
<P>
The appetite for borrowing continued, though at weaker levels
than
last year.
</P>
<P>
Household debt rose 1.12 percent, taking the household debt
indicator
to 138.65 during the third quarter, the lowest quarterly increase
for
three years.
</P>
<P>
The growth in borrowing has slowed in each of the past three
quarters.
Household debt rose 1.7 percent in the first quarter, and 1.5
percent in
the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Bank Rates at 30-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Retail deposit rates in New
Zealand have plunged to their lowest level in nearly three
decades, slashing returns for people with money in the bank.
</P>
<P>
According to data released last weekend by the Reserve Bank,
the central bank in the country, the average deposit rate on money
invested for six months fell to 4.15 percent in November, the
lowest since December 1970.
</P>
<P>
The central bank surveys banks each month and works out a
weighted average interest rate for deposits of at least 10,000 NZ
dollars (5,300 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
On-call deposit rates have also tumbled. Banks in November were
 paying only 2.5 percent for money which could be withdrawn at any
time, about a third their level in June.
</P>
<P>
New Zealanders have 43 billion NZ dollars (22.8 billion U.S.
dollars) deposited in banks, compared to 55 billion NZ dollars
(29.2 billion U.S. dollars) of borrowings from banks, mainly in
the form of home mortgages.
</P>
<P>
However, savers earn more for money invested over three years,
a period over which banks pay an annual return of six percent.

WELLINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Bank of New Zealand (BNZ)
plans to
launch an Internet home banking service by the middle of next
year,
according to a Wellington-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion reported Monday that the solution will be based on
a
service being tried in Australia by BNZ's owner, National
Australia Bank,
but will be tailored to the New Zealand market.
</P>
<P>
Russell Cooke, BNZ project manager of home banking, said his
bank will
begin releasing information about the service in the New Year. "It
will
be competitive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cooke declined to say what encryption technology the service
will use,
but said it will be "very strong."
</P>
<P>
Russell Briant, BNZ product manager of electronic payments,
said the
bank is trying to put systems in place to allow New Zealand
merchants to
charge for goods and services sold over the Internet in foreign
currencies.
</P>
<P>
"A key priority for the bank is to meet the customer need for
multi-
currency transactions and we have been in the forefront of
producing a
solution. We have got people looking at that now," he said.

BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Investors are exhibiting
an increasing interest in participating in waste treatment ventures
in the south China city of Guangzhou and the government plans to

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Intends to Export Cement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is eyeing the markets
in Nepal and Bhutan to export its surplus production of cement,
The Daily Star newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"If everything goes well we shall be able to produce between
6.5 million and 7.0 million tons of cement by the year 2002 and
start exporting the surplus," A.K.M. Muhituddin, convener of
Bangladesh Cement Manufacturers Association, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has 13 cement factories at present, employing some
35,000 people and producing only 1.6 million tons of cement
against an annual capacity of 2.6 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The production can meet just 30 percent of the country's total
demands, with the rest to be imported. Power outrage and stiff
competition from foreign producers were hitting local producers,
Muhituddin said.
</P>
<P>
To satisfy the growing needs of the construction sector, which
contributed 6 percent to the country's gross domestic product
during the 1997-98 fiscal year, four joint venture plants with an
annual production capacity of 1.5 million tons would be set up and
would go into production by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
And the country's existing cement factories were being
modernized and expanded to raise their production capacity to 5.5
million tons a year.
</P>
<P>
The country was on its way to attain self-sufficiency in cement
by 2000 after the modernization was completed by the end of 1999,
Muhituddin added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Palm Oil Output Down 10 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's palm oil output
for this year dropped by 10 percent to 8.3 million tons from 9
million tons last year, according to Malaysian Primary Industries
Minister Lim Keng Yaik.
</P>
<P>
However, palm oil export value rose to 18 billion ringgit
(4.736 billion U.S. dollars) this year from 12.9 billion ringgit
(3.394 billion U.S. dollars) last year because of readjustments to
the ringgit against the U.S. dollar, Lim told a press conference
in Johor Baharu Sunday, the Malaysian news agency Bernama reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Attributing the output decline to the effects of the El Nino
and La Nina weather phenomena, Lim reminded small holders and
plantations not to compromise oil quality by picking premature oil
palm fruits because they wanted to capitalize on the current good
price of the commodity.
</P>
<P>
The minister advised the plantation sector to use part of the
returns from the current price boom to diversify investment,
including in production-boosting efforts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Swimmers to Have Upperhand in First-Day Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese swimmers, dispite one
ace unqualified, will notch up three to four golds from all the
five at stake in the first day's swimming competitions of the
Asian Games, a Chinese coach said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"According to their performances, our swimmers have the chance
to win three to four golds in this evening's finals," said coach
Guo Ruishan.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Given the swimmers' performances in the
preliminaries, Chinese swimmers have an edge in men's 100m
breaststroke, women's 400m individual medley and women's 100m
freestyle. If they brought out their best, they will take a gold
in either men's 200m freestyle or women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
"But it's rather disappointing that my protege Du Jie failed to
qualify for the men's 200-meter freestyle finals," he added.
</P>
<P>
19-year-old Du, Chinese national titlist in 200m freestyle,
finished tenth with a dismal one minute 55.02 second.
</P>
<P>
"He is just too inexperienced and underestimated his
opponents," Guo said."
</P>
<P>
Du's teammate Wang Chuan finished second in 1:52.97 to qualify
comfortably for the finals. Torlarp Sethsothorn of Thailand came
in first in 1:52.77.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese swimmer Zeng Qiliang, the silver medallist of
men's 100m breaststroke in the world championships in January in
Perth, Australia, qualified first in 1:02.38 for the finals of his
specialty.
</P>
<P>
"He swam far better than his oppents, and the gold will surely
be his," said Guo.
</P>
<P>
Shan Ying, though qualified with a seventh finishing time of
58.32 in women's 100m freestyle preliminary, also has a chance to
carry all before her in the finals, said Guo.

preliminary, they will stave off the challenge from their Japanese

</P>
<P>
"My swimmers will try their best in the finals to beat their
Chinese opponents," he added.

<HEADLINE> Four Million Zimbabweans Need Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government needs
at least 120,000 tons of grain for the next three months to feed
more than four million people who have exhausted their food
reserves in communal areas countryside, the daily Herald reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
July Moyo, secretary for public service, labor and social
welfare ministry, told the newspaper Sunday that the number of
people registering for food aid was expected to grow as more
household stocks run out.
</P>
<P>
Some affected areas had already started receiving the relief
food, he said. Although the allocations were inadequate because
of the rising number of people requiring aid, this was all the
government would allocate every month.
</P>
<P>
According to the secretary, more than 500,000 people of the
over four million who have so far registered for food aid will
receive free food while the rest will get maize under the grain
loan scheme. They are expected to repay after the harvest.
</P>
<P>
Private transporters have been hired to supplement the efforts
of the state fleet to move the food as quickly as possible.

<HEADLINE> Sharp Decline in Demand for Australian Wool Bottoms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Australia's semi-official wool
organization Woolmark Company Monday said the steep drop in demand
for Australia's wool overseas could be showing signs of an end.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly market briefing, Woolmark said the Asian crisis
was continuing to affect global demand for commodities but there
were signs of hope for raw wool.
</P>
<P>
Weak demand and competition for other fibers, such as cotton,
have been blamed for a sharp drop in both the export volume and
prices of Australian wool during the past several months.
</P>
<P>
The total wool export volumes of greasy wool for Australia, the
world's leading wool producer, had been pushed down 22 percent in
the four months to October, down from 259.8 million kg to 202.1
million kg.
</P>
<P>
The price of wool has also dropped with the value of wool
exports down 35 percent from 829 million U.S. dollars in the four
months to October, 1997 to 537 million U.S. dollars for the
corresponding period this year.
</P>
<P>
"There are, however, some signs that the sharp decline in raw
wool demand is bottoming out," Woolmark said.
</P>
<P>
China's raw wool demand picked up in October with Australian
exports to China, including Hong Kong, lifting by eight percent
compared with October 1997.
</P>
<P>
China buys about 25 percent of the wool Australia exports.
</P>
<P>
Some re-stocking of mills was taking place in China's Taiwan
and in South Korea while exports to these economies were up 68
percent and 33 percent in October, after 12 months of decline.
</P>
<P>
Exports to other markets including India, Turkey, Mexico and
the Czech Republic were also continuing to rise and expected to
increase even more when import duties were addressed, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
But Woolmark also noted that retail clothing sales had fallen
again in October in Japan and South Korea and that an excess
supply of clothing and uncertain domestic conditions were making
the retail market in China tougher.
</P>
<P>
Low consumer confidence also led to a drop of clothing sales in
many European countries, though retail conditions were better in
Italy than last year and could lead to improved sales.

<HEADLINE> Tension Mounts Before Polls in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- More clashes were reported on
Sunday in northwestern Bangladesh's Pabna district before a
by-election to be held there on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At least five people were injured in clashes between supporters
of the ruling Bangladesh Awami League (BAL) and the major
opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
And there were incidents of houses and poll campaign offices
being set ablaze and attacks on residences and shops, press
reports here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Four candidates from different parties were contesting for the
seat of the Pabna-2 constituency, which was vacated following the
death of a BAL member of parliament in June this year.
</P>
<P>
The election generated much heat and the situation was very
tense in the district, as both the BAL and the BNP, the two major
political rivals in the country, had dubbed it a prestige issue,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested five persons, and none of them was from the
BAL, the reports quoted local people as saying.
</P>
<P>
Police and members of the Bangladesh Rifles were seen
patrolling the sensitive villages in the Pabna-2 constituency to
ward off further violence, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,280 security guards, including 200 servicemen and 240
personnel from the Bangladesh Rifles, would be deployed to ensure
a peaceful, free and fair election.
</P>
<P>
About 188,700 people would cast their votes in 81 polling
centers, an official from the Election Commission Secretariat told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BNP on Sunday asked the Election Commission to
immediately withdraw three senior officials from election duty
from the constituency who they complained were working in favor of
the nominee of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
"The election can't be fair if these officials are not
withdrawn from election duty... and steps taken to ensure
impartial polls," BNP Secretary General Abdul Manna Bhuiyan told a
press briefing Sunday evening.

PANAMA CITY, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Santo Domingo, the capital
of the Dominican Republic, beat out Guadalajara, Mexico and
Medellin, Colombia on Sunday to be chosen as the host city for
the 2003 Pan American Games.
</P>
<P>
Members of the general assembly of the Pan American Sports
Organization selected Santo Domingo in a second round of voting
after eliminating Medellin in the first round and Guadalajara in
the second. The vote count was not released.
</P>
<P>
Puello Herrera, president of the Dominican Olympic committee,
said the Dominican Republic, which suffered heavy damage from
Hurricane Georges in September, will be ready for 2003. It
already has repaired nearly 86 percent of the infrastructure
needed for the games, which will cost nearly 100 million U.S.
dollars to organize.
</P>
<P>
Puello Herrera attributed Sunday's victory to a strong
promotional campaign among the region's Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
The 2003 games will mark the third time that a Caribbean
nation has been the host country. Previous hosts were Puerto Rico
and Cuba.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Astronauts aboard the space
shuttle Endeavor Sunday successfully connected the first two
elements for the international space station.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the two elements -- Zarya built by
Russia and put into space on November 20 and Unity built by NASA
-- to be docked 240 miles above the Earth, and thus paved the way
for the next 5 years' assembly of the international space station.
</P>
<P>
The two station pieces are very big -- 77 feet from the tip of
one to the tip of the other with a total mass of 70,000 pounds,
like a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
Without direct line of sight, astronaut Nancy Currie and her
crew mates had to rely on a computerized vision system and camera
views to capture the Russian Zarya and get the two pieces linked.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, two astronauts will step out the space shuttle and
begin one of their three space walkers to connect the electrical
connectors and cables between the two pieces.

<P>
SEOUL, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investments in South
Korea reached 6.91 billion U.S. dollars in the past 11 months of
this year, 16.4 percent higher than the same period of last year,
according to South Korean Economy and Finance Ministry Monday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments stood at seven billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
November's foreign investments included 117 cases worth 1.378
billion dollars, the second highest in history, against 76 cases
worth 91 million dollars in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The figure was the largest monthly one since the International
Monetary Fund last December agreed to bail out South Korea from a
financial crisis caused by corporate failures and bad loans of
financial institutions with a 58-billion-dollar loan.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the improved foreign investments to the
government's efforts to attract more foreign investors and the
gradual recovery of South Korea's international credibility.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that more foreign funds will flow in along with
further restructuring of key sectors like electronics,
petrochemical and tourism.

<HEADLINE> Thai Democrats Confident of Surviving Censure Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's key democrats said
Monday they were confident that strong public trust would enable
the ruling Democratic Party to survive a censure motion by the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
"We were still more credible than the opposition in the eyes of
the public," Government spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, led by the New Aspiration Party, threatened to
launch a censure motion against some government officials for
their support of the sixth letter of intent to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The opposition maintained that the government had given up
Thailand's sovereignty to the IMF by accepting its conditions for
economic aid. Under the sixth letter of intent, the IMF will grant
Thailand 4.74 billion dollars as part of a bailout package
promised after the financial crisis broke out last year.
</P>
<P>
The debate is expected to be held in early January.
</P>
<P>
Akapol said the no-confidence debate would not change the
political scene and claimed that the opposition also knew it could
not bring the government down.
</P>
<P>
Opposition sources said the intended censure motion would not
target Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai because his popularity has
remained high.
</P>
<P>
Chalerm Yubamrung, a New Aspiration deputy leader, wanted the
debate to focus only on vulnerable ministers to show to the public
that the government had not been without flaws.
</P>
<P>
The opposition admitted earlier that they lacked sufficient
support in the parliament to topple the government.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Holds Women's Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A four-day conference on women
sponsored by the National Committee for Women's Affairs (NCWA)
began here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the first of its kind in Myanmar, aims to
promote the quality of life and ensure regular and sustainable
opportunities for women, safeguard the cultural heritage by women
and enhance their full participation in the nation-building
endeavor.
</P>
<P>
Attending the conference are delegates of the NCWA, government
departments and non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is carrying out a national action plan to speed up
efforts for improving women's condition in the country in line
with the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action adopted at
the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
After the Beijing conference, Myanmar formed the NCWA in 1996
to carry out the country's development project for women.
</P>
<P>
The NCWA has been able to adopt systematic plans and projects
for uplifting the role of women all over the country and success
has been reportedly achieved.
</P>
<P>
Of Myanmar's total population of 46.4 million in the 1997-98
fiscal year, 23.6 million or 50.34 percent are women, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
A census conducted in 1994 showed that 46 percent of Myanmar
women above the age of 10 were in the labor force in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the national literacy rate of women has gone up to
71.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Opposes EU Demand on Closing Sole Nuclear Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria has voiced opposition to
European Union's demand for closing of Bulgaria's sole nuclear
plant on grounds of environmental protection, Bulgarian National
Radio said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the EU's demand put forward at a meeting in
Brussels on December 2, Krassimir Nikolov, chief of the Kozlodoui
plant on the Danube, said the plant is among the best in Europe
and worldwide in nuclear safety.
</P>
<P>
"The closing of the Kozlodoui Nuclear plant, which generates
some 40 percent of the country's electricity, is now out of the
question, " Nikolov stressed, adding that the closure would
greatly undermine the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
The EU's demand was raised under an EU-Bulgaria agreement in
1993 that the first four of a total of six reactors at the
Kozlodoui's should be closed before the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
After signing of the agreement, however, Bulgaria has been
holding that the nuclear safety has been completely improved
thanks to renewal of the installations in the plant.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Roumen Ovcharov, legislator of the opposition
Bulgarian Socialist Party and former energy minister said closing
the reactors would also deal a blow at the nation's security. He
called on all the statesmen and politicians to rally behind a
single position to protect the nation's interests.
</P>
<P>
Mihail Shishenkov, head of the plant's Central Laboratory for
Radiological Control, told the same radio that the readings taken
by the Laboratory and other monitoring entities showed no elevated
radiation were above the usual levels.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the International Atomic Energy Agency will arrive
at Kozlodoui next month at the invitation of the Bulgarian
government to inspect the operation of the plant, Nikolov said.
</P>
<P>
According to the strategy of the Committee for Use of Atomic
Energy for Peaceful Purposes, Kozlodoui's oldest two reactors, the
440 MW Unit One and Unit Two, are to be decommissioned in the
first decade of next century, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Hopes for One Medal in Track and Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Asiad delegation of Hong
Kong, China hopes to win a medal in the track and field
competitions at the Asian Games, head coach Tian Haijiang said
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tian said that Hong Kong's athletes have maintained a good form
after arriving at Bangkok and are ready to run.
</P>
<P>
"We have a good chance to win a medal, and winning a medal of
any color would be a breakthrough," Tian said.
</P>
<P>
"The arch-rival is ourselves," Tian said. "We should have the
confidence."
</P>
<P>
The biggest athletics medal hopeful for Hong Kong, competing in
its first Asian Games after returning to the embrace of China in
July 1, 1997, is women's 100 meters hurdler Chan Sau Ying, who
will run her fourth and perhaps last Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Chan, who has a personal best time of 13.06 seconds, said she
still believe the best time is right ahead after coming fourth
twice in the Beijing and Hiroshima Games.
</P>
<P>
"I will try my best," she said. "If everything goes right, I
can win a medal."
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 Hong Kong athletes will take part in nine events
of the track and field competition in the Games.
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Bangkok, they held a training camp in Guangxi
Autonomous Region in south China with their mainland counterparts
for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We have made a remarkable improvement since there are quite a
few Asia's best athletes in the Chinese national team," Tian said.
</P>
<P>
The track and field competitions of the Asian Games will be
held from December 13 to 20, and China is expected to win a lion's
share of gold medals.

<HEADLINE> U.S. At Odds Over Thai Official For WTO Top Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- United States government
agencies are bickering over whether to support Thai Deputy Prime
Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi's bid to become the new chief of
the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Bangkok Post reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision is considered crucial to the selection of the
WTO chief, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to internal government disagreements, there are two
factors holding up the decision by the United States on whether to
support Supachai or former New Zealand prime minister Michael
Moore, two major contenders for the post, the paper quoted
diplomatic sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
One stumbling block is that American officials want to see
where the votes of a wavering European Union will go.
</P>
<P>
The EU remained badly split as late as Sunday, roughly along
north-south lines -- with many northern Europeans including
Scandinavians in favor of Supachai.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been unable to make a choice despite several rounds
of discussions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Treasury Department has pressed President Bill Clinton
to back Supachai, but Trade Representative Charlene Barshevsky
Favors Moore.
</P>
<P>
Another delaying factor is that Washington is determined to get
one of the deputy-director seats.
</P>
<P>
"The US wants to be a deputy director so badly it probably will
vote for anyone who offers them the position," one source was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said it was premature to speculate that WTO members
will have to vote on the next director. Regulations of the world
trading body require consensus. Except in dire circumstances,
these rules are unlikely to be waived.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a vote might leave the winner beholden only to the
countries which supported him. If a meeting scheduled for Friday
fails again to choose a new chief, nations will consider holding a
vote next month, as suggested by Egypt and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
There are another two contenders vying for the post -- former
trade minister Roy MacLaren of Canada and former agricultural
minister Hassan Abouyoub of Morocco. But diplomatic sources said
the contest is essentially a two-man race between Supachai and the
New Zealander. The Thai Candidate has more votes as of today, but
the U.S. and European votes are so crucial that victory is far
from assured for Supachai.
</P>
<P>
The WTO is supposed to replace its first director Renato
Ruggiero of Italy, by April at the latest.

<HEADLINE> Czech International Payment Deficit Drops Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, December 6 (Xinhua) -- During the first three quarters
of this year the Czech Republic's deficit of international payment
dropped sharply to 15.9 billion korunas (around 530 million
U.S. dollars), or one-fifth of the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Pavel Palivec, spokesman for the Czech State Bank, attributed
this record decline in years to the active development of foreign
trade, sharp reduction of foreign trade deficit and the increase
of tourism.
</P>
<P>
The adverse balance of international payment was as high as
79.4 billion korunas (about 2.65 billion dollars) in the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
This positive development comes after years of worsening
balance of international payment. In 1997, the adverse balance
hit 65.8 billion korunas (about 2.19 billion dollars), or 6.5
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) exceeding the
generally recognized alert level.
</P>
<P>
This index shrank to 1.8 percent in the first half of this year
and is expected to go down to 1.5 percent for the whole year of
1998.

KATHMANDU, December 7 (Xinhua) -- About 3.8 million Nepalese
children aged under five are being administered polio drops Monday
for the third consecutive year as the government resolves to
eradicate the disease from the country by 2000.
</P>
<P>
They are scheduled to be vaccinated free of charge again on
January 18, 1999.
</P>
<P>
A total of 23,000 vaccination centers have been set up
throughout the country and some 100,000 volunteers mobilized for
the immunization program, Health Minister K.B. Gurung said in a
statement, adding that the programs in the past two years were
successful.
</P>
<P>
The government has declared the two days holidays for all
government offices and schools except the ministries and
central-level departments.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Japanese government, a number of
international agencies including the World Health Organization and
the United Nations Children's Fund are supporting the government's
efforts to eradicate polio, a disease which cripples children.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Amend Reform Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai government officials
reiterated on Monday that they would amend the country's
controversial economic reform bills to make sure they benefit
Thais.
</P>
<P>
The bills, which went into effect soon after the financial
crisis broke out last year, allows foreigners to buy Thai assets
and own larger shares of properties.
</P>
<P>
Thai activists are campaigning against the bills, saying they
will open up the country to foreign investors who will take over
Thai jobs and assets.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister's Office Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva told
reporters that the alien business, bankruptcy and foreclosure
bills might be changed, but he refused to give details.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would look at the social and legal
impact of the measures before any changes could be made.
</P>
<P>
"The government will have to listen to its critics and agree to
some changes, provided they do not upset the main goal of the
economic measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he was confident that foreign investors would
understand if some details were altered.
</P>
<P>
"They have to understand and be realistic. I don't remember a
country going through the economic reform process without someone
opposing it," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Investors could rest assured that the government was determined
to push through reforms as soon as possible, he added.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Bulgarians Anxious at Year's End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A poll conducted by the National
Public Opinion Center shows there is a relatively high level of
anxiety among ordinary Bulgarians, the Bulgarian news agency
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
When asked "how do you assess the situation in the country
now?" 40 percent answered "somewhat strained," 16 percent
"troubled," and 40 percent "calm."
</P>
<P>
Poverty and unemployment weigh high on the mind of nearly one
in four of the interviewees, shows the poll which was conducted in
October.
</P>
<P>
Disapproval rate of the government's action to cope with
unemployment and to boost income is slightly weaker than four
months ago.
</P>
<P>
Merely 16 percent of the respondents find that the reforms are
making successful progress, 22 percent think the reforms are
failing, and 33 percent believe the reforms have stagnated.
</P>
<P>
To the question "did you go on holiday this summer?" 47 percent
were negative "because I couldn't afford it."
</P>
<P>
For lack of money, 77 percent will deny themselves the usual
variety of foods, 63 percent the usual quantity of food, 36
percent medicines, 54 percent the purchase of newspapers and
magazines, and 57 percent the purchase of books, the poll shows.
</P>
<P>
In the search for ways to cope with these problems, fewer opt
for working harder (48 percent in July 1997 and 47 percent in the
poll), or for a new job (12 percent in July 1997 and 4 percent
the poll).
</P>
<P>
However, the pollsters say the Bulgarians have not given up working
more, but simply have realized that extra work is not a good
enough way of handling economic hardship.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Athletes Should Learn from Japan, Top Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Athletics Association
President Lou Dapeng said here on Monday that Chinsese athletes
should learn from their Japanese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Lou, also a member of the Technical Committee of the Asian
Games track and field tournament, made these remarks after China
failed to win the Games' first gold medal in the women's marathon
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese athletes has good expierences in training," Lou
said. "Their method is more scientific than ours. The secret
behind their success is that they have made a breakthrough in
training."
</P>
<P>
Naoko Takahashi of Japan claimed the gold with a new Asia's
best time of 2:21:47, with her compatriot Kai Tomoko placing third
in the 42.195-kilometer race.
</P>
<P>
Pre-race favorite Pan Jihong of China finished only fourth in
2:37:29, and her teammate Wang Yanfang came in a distant eighth.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese can always achieve good results in international
competitions, but the Chinese athletes can only run well at home.
" Lou said.
</P>
<P>
" What's the use of running a good time at domestic
competitions?"
</P>
<P>
Pan entered the field with a personal best time of 2:26:39, far
ahead of her clocking in the race.

LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Senior tennis star John McEnroe
gave his army of fans a taste of the glory days with a 7-5, 6-3
victory over Yannick Noah in the final of the Honda Challenge
tennis tournament at London's Olympia on Sunday
</P>
<P>
And the three-time Wimbledon champion then hinted he could
return to the All England Club next year at the age of 39 - to
play with Steffi Graf in the mixed doubles.
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, who last appeared at Wimbledon in 1992 when he won
the men's doubles with Germany's Michael Stich, said: "Steffi saw
me in Geneva last week and suggested we might play.
</P>
<P>
"I have no plans to play men's doubles at Wimbledon because I
have TV commitments and 10 hours behind the mike can drain you.
But playing with Steffi is very tempting.
</P>
<P>
"It's been about 20 years since I last played mixed doubles
and I felt like leaving it for another 20 years. But it's a good
idea to play Wimbledon and maybe the (US) Open with Steffi.
</P>
<P>
"Steffi and I could lose but it's not likely. She could pull
me through so I might be able to fit it in, " he said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Libraries Help Boost Literacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's libraries in 304
townships are playing an important role in boosting the country's
literacy, supported by an average annual publication of over 3,000
titles of books on science, industry and technology.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is also implementing a national plan of action for
education for all. The plan, laid down by the World Education
Conference on Education for All held in Thailand in 1990, covers
both formal and non-formal education.
</P>
<P>
The formal education is designed to enable school-age children
from five to nine to go to school and primary school children to
complete primary education.
</P>
<P>
Non-formal education is aimed at enabling illiterates over
school age (over 15) to become literate by means of the
"functional literacy program."
</P>
<P>
The two education programs aim to ensure that 80 percent of the
population complete primary education, and to reduce the adult
illiteracy rate from 22 percent to 11 percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's literacy campaign started in 1964. The illiteracy
rate was reduced by half to 21 percent in 1983 from 43 percent in
1963.
</P>
<P>
Between 1964 and 1988, 490,398 volunteers took part in literacy
activities with more than 2.4 million illiterates becoming
literate.
</P>
<P>
The national literacy rate of Myanmar has now gone up to 87.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar was awarded two international prizes for its successful
 literacy activities by the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization -- the Mahammad Reza Pahlavi Literacy
Prize in 1971 and the Noma Prize in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Keeping Unemployment Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, which has a
population of 13 million, has been successful in tackling the
employment issue and keeping the jobless rate well under control.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that in 1997, the number of employees
was 8.47 million, 1.49 million more than in 1978. The unemployment
rate was three percent.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, Shanghai has been engaged in
market-oriented employment reforms, increasing the number of job
channels for local people.
</P>
<P>
As the number of layoffs rises with the reforms in state
enterprises, the city government has set up re-employment
centers. In the past seven years, 1.19 million of the city's 1.4
million laid-off workers have found jobs with the help of these
centers.
</P>
<P>
The city has also created job opportunities by promoting a
range of industries like the service industry, which has hired
3.23 million people, accounting for 38.2 percent of the city's
entire work force.
</P>
<P>
The private sector has also helped by absorbing nearly 900,000
people. In 1980, only 3,600 people were employed by private
businesses.

<HEADLINE> Top Chinese PC Maker Cashing in on Software Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- China's largest personal
computer manufacturer, the Legend Group, set up a joint venture
software company with one of the world's leading software
developer, Computer Associates (CA) of the United States, this
week.
</P>
<P>
This is Legend's second major move to increase its exposure in
the software business, after a cooperation agreement with IBM
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
CA is claimed to be a large software producer second only to
Mirosoft. Over 90 percent of the world's 500 biggest companies use
its products.
</P>
<P>
Legend and CA hold an equity share of 50 percent each in the
3.5 million U.S. dollar Guanqun Computer Corp. Ltd. of Beijing,
which is to develop software technology and manufacture various
related products. Over 70 percent of the company produces will be
exported.
</P>
<P>
Du Yongbo, general manager of the joint venture, says that the
company will release Chinese software called "Wending" in six
months for Chinese-language users all over the world. Their
cooperation, he says, is intended to facilitate the development of
Chinese language-based software.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Legend has signed a cooperative agreement
with a major Chinese software developer, UFsoft (Group) Corp., and
invested in Beijing's Kingsoft software company.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that Legend will tie software to its hardware products
in order to fight piracy in the country's software market.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Upgrades Its 747 Production System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Boeing and its partners have
quietly invested about 350 million U.S. dollars to upgrade the 747
production system, according to Sunday's Seattle Times.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted "insiders" as saying that the investment in
new tooling and design procedures is intended to protect Boeing's only
monopoly franchise -- the 747 jumbo jet, the most profitable plane in
Boeing's production line.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's investment decision was made when it prepares for massive
layoffs and a contraction of its commercial airplane operation.
</P>
<P>
With the money, the Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer is
overhauling aging tooling and introducing a digital-design process.
The upgraded production system is supposed to make Boeing's oldest and
most famous plane more competitive by reducing costly "rework" and
thus cutting the number of people working on it as well as the price,
which is listed at 160 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The overhaul will also open the door to new 747 derivative models,
either with more seats or flying longer distance, that could steal
market share from rival Airbus.
</P>
<P>
Competing head-to-head with 747, Airbus plans to launch A3XX, a
four-engine, 550-seat "superjumbo" jet next year.
</P>
<P>
But Boeing's big investment on 747 is also a risky one. Only last
week, sagging Asian demand for jumbo airplanes forced the company to
dramatically cut the 747 production rate to two, and perhaps even to
one, aircraft a month by 2000, down from five a month today.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Boeing faces shrinking long-term demand for its 440-seat
four-engine planes because airlines are increasingly favoring the
large twin-engine jet with fewer seats, which are more fuel-efficient
and easier to maintain and operate.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, both Boeing and Airbus eye the future market for
large airplanes. Over the next 20 years, Boeing estimates airline
traffic will grow nearly five percent annually and airlines will need
1,030 jumbo-size airplanes. Airbus estimates airlines will need more
than 1,300 planes larger than 747.

<HEADLINE> Blueprint Stresses Sciences in Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Science and
Technology is working on guidelines to help increase agricultural
production and fatten farmers' wallets.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, the move is a response to the
just-concluded Third Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China. The session emphasized "promoting
agricultural science and the technological revolution,"
</P>
<P>
The ministry will concentrate more on stepping up
agro-technology innovations, accelerating agricultural
modernization and spreading technology in rural areas, especially
in the central and western regions of China.
</P>
<P>
In addition to broadening and deepening the nation's
agricultural producers' skills, dissemination agencies
set up under the previous planned economy, regional scientific and
technological departments will, in line with the market economy,
encourage more technology service companies to provide farmers
with modern farming skills.
</P>
<P>
Advanced information technologies, such as global positioning
systems and remote-sensing technologies, will be added to improve
meteorological and natural disaster forecasting efficiencies in
the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
More computerized networks will be made available to distribute
updated agricultural technologies and to advise farmers of the
lastest market demands.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Vice-Minister Han Deqian as saying that more
efforts will be made to develop biotechnology, especially
technologies related to the cultivation of genetically altered
crops.
</P>
<P>
The world had an average of 35 million hectares of genetically
altered crops last year. China lags behind developed countries in
growing such crops but tops the world in cultivating hybrid maize,
wheat and rice.
</P>
<P>
The country has made breakthroughs in growing pest-resistant
tomatoes through the gene manipulation technology.

<HEADLINE> Northeastern Chinese Province Getting More Foreign Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, a heavy
industrial center in northeast China, is still attractive to
foreign investors and its contracts on foreign investment were up
0.6 percent to 3.67 billion U.S. dollars worth in the first ten
months this year.
</P>
<P>
The increased investment is in contrast with the drop of 1.2
percent in the number of foreign-invested projects approved,
which is 1,370, according to the provincial foreign trade and
economic cooperation department.
</P>
<P>
The province used 670 million U.S. dollars worth of foreign
loans in the ten months, up 22 percent on an annual basis. Its
7,322 foreign-backed enterprises exported 2.82 billion
U.S. dollars worth of goods in the same period, an increase of
17.5 percent. Their industrial output value rose by a yearly rate
of 11 percent to 56.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Department officials said that the increased foreign investment
comes in spite of the Asian financial crisis mainly because of
Europe and North America's increased funding, which has more than
offset the reduction in investment from Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines to Submit Rehabilitation Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The financially-troubled
Philippine Airlines (PAL) is taking its first shaky step towards
recovery as it will submit a proposed rehabilitation plan to the
country's Securities and Exchange Commission Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Business World newspaper reported Monday that PAL is making
its move amid speculation about whether or not Cathay Pacific
Airways would return to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, President Joseph Estrada said he would do
everything he could to convince the two parties to resume their
talks over a possible merge, by which Cathay would buy a
substantial stake into PAL.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the rehabilitation plan outlines the flag
carrier's business program for the next five years with the goal
of generating revenues of about 855 million U.S. dollars by the
year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, PAL hopes to reach its target revenue with a
fleet of 22 aircraft and a manpower complement of around 7,500
employees, 500 less than its current 8,000-strong work force, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The plan also provides for the improvement of PAL's
international route network as well as how to take better
advantage of the flag carrier's current 63 percent share of the
Philippine aviation market.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Private Business Getting Larger Feed Market Share </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 7 (Xinhua) -- While many of China's feed
manufacturers are suffering this year, the Hope Group continues to
grow month by month to have a 10-percent share in the domestic
feed market.
</P>
<P>
The largest private group of China with headquarters in
Chengdu, Sichuan Province, said that its sales is expected to
reach 3.3 million tons this year, compared with last year's three
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Sales in the feed industry plummeted 16 percent from last
year. Analysts say that a drop in the price of pigs and a smaller
number of pigs being raised are to blame.
</P>
<P>
Hope Group President Liu Yonghao said the reason his company is
able to buck the general trend is that the group has put a lot of
effort into tapping the potential of rural markets.
</P>
<P>
It also took advantage of the possibilities when foreign
companies began withdrawing from the China market because of the
Asian financial turmoil and took control of some areas they
originally controlled.
</P>
<P>
Pig feed is Hope's major product, but the company is also
developing poultry food and fish food.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Hugo Chavez was elected Sunday
Venezuela's president for the next five years from 1999 to 2004,
according to the first official bulletin released by the National
Electoral Council.
</P>
<P>
Of 76.12 percent of the counted votes, Hugo Chavez won 2.87
million, representing 56.34 percent of the counted votes,
as compared to 2.02 million, or 39.59 percent, for Henrique Salas, his
close challenger.
</P>
<P>
Hugo Chavez, 44, graduated from Venezuela's Military Academy in
1975. He was appointed commander of an elite paratrooper unit
after being working in the presidential palace to help guard then
President Carlos Andres Perez.
</P>
<P>
"Today a new Venezuela is being born," Chavez, who will be
sworn in on February 2, 1999, said in his first TV interview,
calling for unity and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He also called on foreign investors to have confidence in his
future government.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela is the world's largest oil producer outside the
Middle East and the second largest oil supplier to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
However, the economic slump has attacked the oil-rich country.
Venezuela has foreseen an oil income of 19 billion U.S. dollars in
1998, but it finally settles at 12 billion dollars, due to lower
crude prices.

<HEADLINE> Investments in Infrastructure to Grow Quickly: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said that investments in infrastructure projects for local
government units in the Asia Pacific region would reach around 292
billion U.S. dollars by the year 2020 from 38 billion dollars in
1990.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Bulletin newspaper Monday quoted Asad Ali Shah, ADB
manager for water supply, as saying that 30 percent of the total
investments would account for the development of water supply.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is looking at areas which it could help finance
infrastructure projects such as water supply, urban sector
support, low-cost housing and financing, the ADB official said.
</P>
<P>
Shah said that one important challenge facing the ADB is the
institutional and capacity building programs of municipal
governments to source funding requirements.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the development is fully-entrenched in municipal
governments, sustained growth would not be achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, he said, the ADB plans to extend loans
amounting to 200 million to the Philippines for its regional
development projects and the reduction of level of poverty in
urban centers.

<P>
ROME, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan said here Sunday that he will accept any decision over his
case made by Italy or European Union, if the international
community pledges to take concrete steps to resolve the Kurdish
issue.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan told Italian news agency ANSA that an Italian-backed
proposal for him to be tried in an international court would be
the best possible solution.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested by Italy after flying into Rome from Moscow
on November 12. As the leader of Kurdistan Worker Party, he is
Turkey's most wanted man.
</P>
<P>
Italy's rejection over Turkish demands for his extradition has
caused a crisis in relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan also explained Sunday that his only desire is to win
"the respect of the entire Kurdish population and the political
recognition of their problem within Turkey."
</P>
<P>
But he reiterated that now he wants to find a peaceful
solution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Now things have changed and we are ready to stop the
fighting," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan is currently under house arrest in Rome on the basis of
a German warrant, but Germany has said that it will not request
his extradition and the warrant will expire on December 22.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Expects to Reach This Year's Export Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The hefty increase in
Shanghai's exports in the first ten months of this year will lead
to a fulfilment of the year's target, the Municipal Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation Commission said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai exported 13.77 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods
from January to October, up 10.16 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
With the encouraging performance, said commission head Zhu
Xiaoming, the city is sure that it can reach its export target of
16.3 billion U.S. dollars for the year.
</P>
<P>
According to him, 46.7 percent of the city's exports for the
January-October period were from overseas-financed businesses.
</P>
<P>
Although Shanghai's exports to other parts of Asia suffered a
decline of 7.14 percent to 6.1 billion U.S. dollars in the ten
months, an increase of 20 percent was recorded in its exports to
Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Because of the Asian financial crisis, exports slowed down a
great deal this year, Zhu said, and he believes that Shanghai
needs to come up with a strategy for increasing medium- and
high-quality exports, with emphasis on new products and high-tech
products in particular.
</P>
<P>
The city will develop new measures to increase exports by
encouraging private companies and scientific research institutes
to get involved in foreign trade, and letting medium-sized and
small enterprises get foreign trade approval more quickly.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- One late goal from Greek
defender Nikos Dabizas gave Newcastle United a 2-2 draw against
Middlesbrough at the English Premier League on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough had lost their previous four north-east league
derbies but seemed set for a victory after having the best of
things at the Riverside Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Andy Townsend shot them ahead after 13 minutes after Paul
Gascoigne picked him out with a clever corner but Frenchman
Laurent Charvet deservedly equalised with a fierce volley from
the edge of the box seven minutes before halftime.
</P>
<P>
Boro took charge in the second half but Brian Deane and
Townsend were both foiled by stand-in goalkeeper Steve Harper.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old was making his first appearance for Newcastle
after spending five years waiting for his chance and made it
memorable by scooping Deane's point-blank header on to the bar
and then brillianty tipping Townsend's drive round the post.
</P>
<P>
However, he could do little about Middlesbrough's second in
the 59th minute when Colin Cooper's tame shot took a hefty
defelection and looped into the net.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough, who conceded a late goal a week ago to draw at
Arsenal, then sat back and paid the price when substitute Dabizas
was left unmarked to loop in a header in the 84th minute.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough remain seventh in the standings, six points
behind leaders Aston Villa. Newcastle stay 13th.

This exchange of goods was the beginning of the border
trade with Vietnam. The village of Miqi, where Huang lives, has 30
households. The border runs through the village to its south. Huang
pointed to a deserted trading street and said it was crowded and
busy between 1989 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhongle, an official in the city of Pingxiang, under whose
jurisdiction Miqi is, says that the China-Vietnam border trade was
initially done mainly on this street. Then it started to take on
more modern features like joint operations and technological
cooperation, with full government support.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the autonomous regional government isssued
preferential trade policies for border areas to promote economic
exchanges with Vietnam. Traders did not have to pay import tariffs
if they bought something for less than 1,000 yuan at the trading
centers and tariffs were cut by half for small volumes of
imports.

<TEXT>
<P>
The autonomous region has a 1,020-km border and opened 25
border markets in the last two decades. The market at Miqi was
deserted because of transport difficulties. Other counties with
good transportation prospered.
</P>
<P>
Exports from China are mainly machinery, building materials,
spayers, pesticides, bicycles, electric fans, sewing
machines, beer, textiles and thermoses.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's exports are mainly fruits, lumber, marine products
rubber and minerals.
</P>
<P>
Chinese exports do well in Vietnam, because they are cheap and
have reasonably quality, and, more important, they are in
short supply in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi's border trade is worth 3.1 billion yuan annually, up
from 450 million yuan in 1989.
</P>
<P>
According to the government of Pingxiang, 13,000 of its 170,000
people are involved in border trade. This has affected the growth
of other sectors like tourism, transportation, warehousing, and
the food service industry. Per capita income of farmers here
increased from 551 yuan 9 years ago to the present 2,173
yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The city of Shenzhen nearby
Hong Kong has transformed itself from Hong Kong's major fresh
vegetable and meat provider to a machinery and electronics
products exporter in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official of the city government,
machinery and electronics exports accounted for nearly 60 percent
of the city's total exports last year.
</P>
<P>
This is attributable to the presence of large multinationals
like IBM, Hitachi and Fuji, said Li Qingsen, director of the
city's foreign investment bureau.
</P>
<P>
There are 150 multinationals, 36 from the world's top 500, with
investments in this former fishing village, and foreign investors
contributed 36 percent of the city's GDP last year, Li said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October, Shenzhen had used 16.91 billion
U.S. dollars worth of foreign investment, which is earmarked for
more than 15,000 projects.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 51 Sino-foreign joint ventures in the city were
among the country's top 500 businesses.

According to local sources, when the Yanjiatai section of the
Yangtze River Levee appeared to be under threat from July 20 to
25, the three officials were nowhere to be found. When they were
informed of the possibly imminent danger, they took no steps to
reinforce the levee, which then collapsed on August 7.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Angola's opposition
UNITA on Sunday allowed 14 U.N. peacekeepers to evacuate,
according to a U.N. statement released here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
had finally given permission for an aircraft to land to pack up
the peacekeepers, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
They are currently in safety at the U.N. Observer Mission in
Angola's regional headquarters in Huambo, it added.
</P>
<P>
UNITA had blocked the evacuation of the peacekeepers about a
month ago in retaliation for the refusal of the Angolan government
to allow the United Nations to fly to UNITA areas to resupply the
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan hopes very much that the
release of U.N. personnel would encourage all concerned to
proceed with full implementation of the Lusaka protocol, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, aimed to end nearly two decades of civil war in
the African country, was signed in Lusaka, Zambia, between the
Angolan government and UNITA in 1994 and is currently monitored by
over 1,000 U.N. peacekeepers.

<HEADLINE> White House Gets Two-Day Impeachment Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The White House will have 30
hours over two days to present its defense of U.S. President Bill
Clinton but the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee made
clear Sunday it would not be deterred from starting the
impeachment debate this week.
</P>
<P>
White House lawyers had asked for three to four days to make
its case, but the Judiciary Committee countered Sunday with an
offer of two 15-hour days on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The committee plans to start the impeachment debate on
Thursday, and it will continue into Friday.
</P>
<P>
Given the public statements of committee members, it is all but
certain the panel will vote at least one article of impeachment
arising from the Monica Lewinsky matter, and the full House will
take it up the week of December 14.
</P>
<P>
In a testy letter, Judiciary chief of staff and general counsel
Thomas Mooney said the White House can have some time but
Judiciary Committee members will be able to question any of the
witnesses Clinton's lawyers present.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Committee who are conducting the
impeachment inquiry will be permitted to ask questions of anyone
who appears before the Committee," Mooney wrote in a letter
released to reporters.
</P>

White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said the president's team
would formally respond on Monday, but would work within the

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Announce Program Against Medicare Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
is proposing a series of changes that will save the federal
government at least 2.1 billion U.S. dollars by cracking down on
waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
In his first proposal for the federal budget beginning next
October 1, Clinton will announce Monday a package of legislative
initiatives that would help the Health Care Financing
Administration (HCFA) combat wasteful or abusive practices. The
initiatives are being reported at a White House ceremony.
</P>
<P>
A White House official, who discussed the package Sunday on
condition of anonymity, said the plan includes eliminating markups
in the prices Medicare is charged for drugs. Under Clinton's plan,
Medicare would pay what a drug costs the provider, a policy
currently used by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Medicare covers only certain drugs that must be administered by
a doctor or in a hospital, such as those used for dialysis or
organ transplants.
</P>
<P>
The official said Clinton was taking this action to "ensure
that not one dime of the program's trust fund is wastefully
spent," especially as the Medicare Commission works to find ways
to strengthen the program by 2010.
</P>
<P>
An inspector general's report in the Department of Health and
Human Services found that markups for 22 drugs cost Medicare
hundreds of millions of dollars annually because Medicare paid
more than twice the average wholesale price for certain drugs, and
in one instance paid roughly 10 times the wholesale price.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's plan would give HCFA authority to oversee the
performance of contractors better and terminate those who perform
poorly. It also allows HCFA to begin competitive bidding this
Spring to decrease Medicare payments for hospital beds and other
durable medical equipment, which would help lower Medicare's cost
for that equipment.
</P>
<P>
Early next year, HCFA will release a comprehensive plan for
promoting "appropriate reimbursement" of legitimate providers
for services deemed "covered, reasonable and necessary."

commander Hugo Chavez on Sunday scored big votes in the last

the votes, compared to 36 percent for Henrique Salas, a
Yele-educated businessman. according to preliminary results of
several Venezuelan companies.

Turnout was heavy among Venezuela's nearly 11 million eligible
votes, with 82 percent casting ballots in the South American
country.
</P>
<P>
Hugo Chavez graduated from Venezuela's Military academy in
1975. He was appointed commander of an elite paratrooper unit
after being working in the presidential palace to help guard then
President Carlos Andres Perez.
</P>
<P>
"Today a new Venezuela is being born," Chavez told reporters
after casting his ballot.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela is the world's largest oil reserves outside the
Middle East and the second largest oil supplier to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
However, the economic slump has attacked the oil-rich country.
Venezuela had foreseen an oil income of 19 billion dollars in
1998, but it finally settled at 12 billion dollars, due to lower
crude prices.
