PILOT SHORTAGE MADE WORSE BY F-16 WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BARRETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Luke Air Force Base is under the gun to churn out more
fighter pilots at the very time when its aging fleet of F-16s is
shrinking and under duress.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's West Valley base, the world's largest for F-16
training, is boosting class sizes to offset one of the worst Air
Force pilot shortages ever. In the past four years, Luke's
basic-training class increased by nearly a third, to 168 pilots
from 113.
</P>
<P>
   And although Luke normally sends up more jets in a day than
other bases do in a week, a continuing string of crashes keeps
grounding the fleet, playing havoc with the &UR; Air Force's stepped-up
training schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Now, questions are being raised about Luke's ability to handle
the increased load while struggling with an unprecedented number of
jet engine problems and its worst accident rate in more than two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to send folks up in airplanes that aren't
safe,'' assured Lt. Col. Bill Gonzalez, commander of Luke's 56th
Training Squadron.
</P>
<P>
   But officials concede the base is in a quandary.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, there was a glut of pilots and so few new
trainees that Air Force instructors outnumbered students. Fewer
than 500 new pilots were trained in 1995. This year, the Air Force
wants to train double that many.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials admit that the military underestimated its
future need for pilots after the Cold War ended. It also didn't
foresee the flood of pilots bailing out of the service just as the
U.S. military stepped up its role in overseas conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force estimates it is 200 pilots short of what it needs
this year. &QL; 
LUKE `AT CAPACITY'
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of new F-16 pilot training falls to Luke, though Air
National Guard units in Springfield, Ohio, and San Antonio have
begun training F-16 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Luke officials think they can handle the crush as long as the
base gets the engine parts it needs _ and more jets are not lost to
crashes or mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working at capacity now,'' said Capt. Richard Douglas, a
classroom instructor and pilot at Luke. ``We have cockpits we need
to fill.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, fliers are training in jets that are nearly 20 years old
and increasingly plagued by engine malfunctions that have caused
more than half the recent crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Although in each case the pilots safely ejected, six $20 million
jets have been lost since last fall, and another was seriously
damaged Sept. 20th.
</P>
<P>
   Without extra money to speed delivery of new parts, Luke must
rely on stepped-up inspections to detect potentially deadly
problems. &QL; 
INSUFFICIENT INSPECTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Not all those inspections have proved effective, as Air Force
reports obtained by The Arizona Republic reveal.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force investigators faulted Luke inspectors in at least two
of the base's seven recent accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, officials said inspectors either had not installed
or had incorrectly installed a landing-gear pin that might have
prevented the April crash of an F-16 jet.
</P>
<P>
   Another investigative report said the base's inspection
procedures for augmentor ducts were ``ineffective.'' The ducts
provide engine thrust. Cracks in the part were blamed for
back-to-back crashes of Luke jets in February and March.
</P>
<P>
   Duct inspections have recently been improved to a level ``one
step short of a laboratory,'' said the base's commander, Brig. Gen.
John L. Barry. But the more rigorous process forced the base to
ground its entire fleet at once, pushing training back more than a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Each delay leaves instructors scrambling to rearrange flight
schedules and classes so pilots can graduate in time to get to
their next assignments. Pilots can be sent into combat within three
months of leaving Luke.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Air Force higher-ups) consider it our job to meet
timelines, and so do we,'' Gonzales said.
</P>
<P>
   The base has broken a few traditional practices to accommodate
the time crunch, Gonzales said, including consolidating classes and
sharing resources to allow extra time for inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Barry was the first to fly after each of the recent accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important that they (pilots) know that I'm not going to
put them in an airplane that's not safe to fly,'' Barry said. &QL; 
AGING FLEET
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are questions about the safety of older jet engines
pushed to the limit every day.
</P>
<P>
   Since last fall, there have been 18 military accidents involving
the single-engine F-16s. Luke pilots flew seven of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did bother me some that we were flying with many known
engine problems at Luke,'' said one Luke officer, who requested
anonymity for fear of retribution. ``Why could we not fix them? was
my main concern. I realize the Air Force accepts the risk, but what
bothered me most was: Why could they not accept the responsibility
when a jet went down?''
</P>
<P>
   The most troubling issue involves the augmentor duct, an engine
part used in nearly all of Luke's fighters. The Air Force did not
begin individual inspections of the ducts until a string of minor
mishaps in recent years was traced to cracks in them.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the base completed its first inspections of the
ducts, one of the parts that had been examined fell off a jet
during a February training mission. The jet plunged to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Barry responded by asking maintenance crews to closely
re-examine a duct they had inspected immediately after the duct had
fallen off the other jet. Inspectors found nothing unusual, and the
duct went back into service.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, that jet fell out of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The cause: Cracks in the augmentor duct.
</P>
<P>
   New, more intensive procedures implemented after that second
crash have detected cracks in more than one-tenth of the engines in
Luke's 200-plus jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has set aside $128 million over the next two
fiscal years to deal with those and other problems identified in
the Pratt &AMP; Whitney engines.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert May, the Air Force's propulsion product group
manager, doesn't expect the base to receive any new augmentor ducts
until next spring.
</P>
<P>
   It could take a few years to replace the old ducts with new
versions designed to prevent cracking. Until then, the base will
continue stepped-up inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Barry thinks the inspections will prevent future crashes caused
by the same malfunctioning part.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Sept. 20th crash is still under investigation, it
appears to have been caused by an electrical system malfunction,
not the augmentor duct. &QL;

Montoya sets track mark in Houston
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
It was clear early in the second qualifying session Saturday that
the 1998 track record on the downtown Houston course was not going
to be around by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing to determine was which driver would go fast
enough past the record to win the pole for today's Texaco/Havoline
Grand Prix of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Montoya saw in the slower qualifying session that his time
from Friday would not hold up. Adrian Fernandez beat it to take the
top spot before the faster cars took the track. And Bryan Herta
briefly had the quickest lap during the last qualifying session.
</P>
<P>
   But Montoya was not to be denied, earning the pole with a
track-record lap of 93.651 mph on the 1.53-mile, 10-turn course. It
was the seventh pole of the season for the 24-year-old Colombian,
tying the CART rookie record set by Nigel Mansell in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point (records) don't mean as much to me,'' Montoya
said Saturday. ``Maybe 10 or 20 years from now I will remember them
and say, `That was good.' But for the moment, I'm just trying to
win the championship. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya earned a point for winning the pole and leads Dario
Franchitti by 29 points entering today's race. Montoya can clinch
the FedEx championship if he is 44 points ahead of Franchitti at
the end of the race, but it won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti will start on the outside of row 2 in the No. 27 Kool
Green Honda/Reynard. He was one of six drivers who bettered the
track record Greg Moore set last year (92.377 mph) in qualifying
for the inaugural Houston race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got blocked on my best lap today, when my tires were at
their best,'' Franchitti said. ``After that I was pushing really
hard, but we didn't have the car to get to the front.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez had the pole after the first session with a lap at
91.943 mph, but he knew that wouldn't hold up when the quicker cars
came on the track. Nine drivers would better that speed, and the
first was Montoya on his second lap.
</P>
<P>
   But Herta, who will start next to Montoya on the front row, was
on the pole for a moment when he turned a lap at 93.037 mph before
Montoya had a lap to better him. Then Montoya bettered himself
before the session ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a really funky session,'' Herta said. ``I had a good
lap going when Christian (Fittipaldi) went into the tires (bringing
out a yellow flag). I was getting so frustrated that I was yelling
on the radio to Bob (team owner Bobby Rahal) to try to get some of
the frustration out.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tracy was feeling no frustration, improving his starting
spot from ninth Friday to third after the final qualifying session
with a lap at 93.006 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of being on the track at the right time
and being lucky that we didn't get the rain,'' Tracy said. ``I was
able to put together a couple of clean laps without traffic, which
is tough to do here.''
</P>
<P>
   The start of today's 100-lap race could bring back some bad
memories for Team Kool Green drivers Tracy and Franchitti. Because
the race starts on the Austin backstretch, the Kool Green drivers
will be side by side at the green flag as they head for the turn
where they collided last year.
</P>
<P>
   It ended the day for Tracy, but Franchitti went on to win the
rain-shortened event. Montoya thinks that same turn at the end of
the backstretch will be the place to watch today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be a couple of crashes on the
backstretch,'' Montoya said. ``If you are not completely beside a
guy, he's not going to give you room on that turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy believes the driver who makes the right braking decisions
today will win the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brakes always are going to be an issue here,'' Tracy said.
``There aren't a lot of places to cool the brakes. You have a lot
of tricky braking zones and it's very easy to slide off into a
runoff area if you're not careful.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the braking zones are fairly bumpy. You are braking right
at the limit of adhesion. Passing depends on how deep you can brake
going into the corner. Five feet too much and you're not going to
make the corner. You will slide into the barrier or get turned
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya made enough good decisions on the track Saturday to
shatter the course record, but he didn't slow once he regained the
pole over Herta. Montoya's ninth of 11 laps made it clear no other
driver was going to catch him.
</P>
<P>
   His speed was more than six/tenths of a mph better than Herta,
and had a lap time of 58.699 seconds to Herta's 59.086. That's a
huge amount in a sport where hundredths of a second can change your
starting position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I could go pretty quick,'' Montoya said. ``We started
out just trying to beat Fernandez's time, then everybody else went
quicker. So I wasn't being conservative. I was close to the wall a
couple of times and I went, `Uh oh.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You never really know if you are on a quick lap on a street
course. You just have to push it. You can't be conservative or you
will start losing time.''
</P>
<P>
   With three races remaining on the 1999 CART schedule, Franchitti
is running out of time in his quest to catch Montoya for the
championship. Tracy was asked if he would try to help his teammate
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing as much as I can to help Dario, but there's not that
much I can do,'' Tracy said. ``Ultimately, Dario has to do it
himself. He has to beat that little guy (Montoya).''

Europeans set to sip from Cup
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Ben Crenshaw's American team saved pride
Saturday, but it will take more than competitive juices today to
save the Ryder Cup from another Concorde ride back across the pond.
</P>
<P>
   It will take destiny.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans face a 10-6 deficit going into today's 12 singles
matches. Nobody has ever overcome more than a two-point margin to
win the Ryder Cup on the final day.
</P>
<P>
   Only a dreamer, somebody smitten with passion and patriotism,
and overdosing on reds, whites and blues, would believe anything
other than a third depressing Ryder Cup loss in a row is going to
befall the Americans today. In other words, Crenshaw thinks destiny
might ride shotgun with his team today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to leave you with one thought,'' Crenshaw said at the
end of his postmatch interview Saturday night. ``I'm a big believer
in fate. And I have a good feeling about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, break out the tarot cards and crank up the instant karma.
Call the Psychic Hotline and see if Madam Mystic is available. The
Americans are going to need all the help they can get.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw hasn't given up hope for his team, but just about
everybody else has after the Americans played better Saturday than
they had the previous day, yet couldn't make up any ground on the
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   What we have today in the 33rd Ryder Cup Matches is an
exhibition in the truest sense. The Americans and Europeans will
perform at The Country Club for fun and entertainment in 12 singles
matches.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is at stake, of course. The Cup is lost, unless
three-quarters of a century of history can be rewritten. As the
Americans split four points in the alternate-shot and best-ball
action right down the middle, they found the Europeans' four-point
lead unchanged after a dozen hours of play Saturday. A rowdy crowd
and a few better efforts from the Americans weren't enough to
derail the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Americans) need pumping up, because they're
losing,'' said Colin Montgomerie, who teamed with fellow Scot Paul
Lawrie for an important win Saturday afternoon over Tiger Woods and
Steve Pate. ``And they're losing heavily.''
</P>
<P>
   David Duval suggested in the lead-up to the Cup that this was
merely an exhibition because they don't hand out winner's checks.
During the first two days of play, it has been proved in the
Americans' camp that you get what you pay for. Even some disgusted
American fans in the gallery have uttered those very words.
</P>
<P>
   To win the Cup today, the Americans will have to win 8{ singles
points in the 12 matches. Mathematically, it's possible.
</P>
<P>
   But if you believe it will happen, you also believe your next
par-3 will yield a hole-in-one. A collapse today by Europe would
make Choke City look like a minor throat-clearing.
</P>
<P>
   As defending champion, Europe needs only 14 points to retain the
trophy. The Americans must earn 14{ points to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too high a hill,'' said Hal Sutton, who was
responsible for 1{ points Saturday and has been Crenshaw's best
player so far. ``We've shown a lot of fight this week. And I think
we can show some more. I think we've all got some more left in
us.''
</P>
<P>
   European captain Mark James stopped short of saying his team is
in the driver's seat, although it clearly is. But he said his
players have put themselves precisely where they had hoped to be
after two days of team play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a disappointment if we don't (win the Cup) because a
four-point lead is a reasonable lead,'' James said. ``But we're
under no illusions. We know the USA is going to fight back hard. We
have a huge amount of work to do yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But not nearly as much as the Americans if they are to fulfill
their captain's predictions that good things will happen today.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what has Crenshaw so optimistic is he and his team know
how close they are to being much closer to the Europeans. The
Americans had their chances Saturday to make this match tighter.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Garcia and Jesper Parnevik again decked the Americans. In
the morning's alternate-shot play, they beat Payne Stewart and
Justin Leonard 3 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the most pressure-packed match of the afternoon
best-ball action, they won the 18th hole to square their match with
David Duval and Davis Love III, giving Europe a somewhat unexpected
half-point. It was the difference between a three-point lead and a
four-point lead going into the final day.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia and Parnevik combined to go 3-0-1 in the first two days.
Only Lanny Wadkins and Larry Nelson in 1979 have accumulated a
better score in pairs, winning all four of their matches.
</P>
<P>
   When it wasn't the dyanmic duo, it was Colin Montgomerie
spoiling things for the United States. Though Jeff Maggert and
Sutton beat Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie in the morning match, the
pair of Scots won the 15th and 16th holes to take a 2-up lead on
Tiger Woods and Steve Pate. They closed it out when Woods missed a
six-foot putt down the hill on the 17th that would have sent the
match to the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Phil Mickelson's hot putter had led him and Tom Lehman
to a 2 and 1 win over Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning matches, it was similarly sweet-and-sour for the
Americans. They did enough good things to keep pace, but not enough
to make up much-needed ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been part of a team like this before,'' Montgomerie
said. ``We all want to win so, so badly for our tour. This is
fantastic and I really do want to win this thing, I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the fates are in cahoots with Crenshaw, Monty won't be
disappointed today.

<P>
   Also, the workers said that they still suffered adverse effects
even with the earplugs, earmuffs, hearing tests and other measures.
Some reported sore throats from shouting to make themselves heard
over the noise. Some said they had headaches or other problems even
with earplugs and earmuffs, and found the workplace still
excruciatingly loud.
</P>
<P>
   Butcher said the union's contract required the city to adhere to
the provision as it was written in the municipal code. When the
city refused to arbitrate the matter, the union took the issue to
Superior Court but lost. The union appealed and won, setting the
stage for an arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitration was split into two issues - whether the city was
liable for the extra pay and, if so, how much should be owed, to
whom and how far back, Butcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the union won on the first issue, the city decided to
negotiate a settlement on the latter issue - working out the
details of the payout.
</P>
<P>
   That is being finalized now between the union and its opponents,
the City Attorney's Office and city Chief Administrative Office.
The two sides are set to meet this week to work out the details,
and it is possible the settlement could be finished this week, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a frustrating, really protracted struggle,'' Butcher
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the city is expected to pay out between $1.5 million
and $2 million to about 300 city street services workers who work
under those noisy conditions, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides still have not agreed on whether the city will
now begin paying those workers the extra compensation from this
point forward, she said. The city would like to alter the provision
that provides for the higher pay.
</P>
<P>
   With this victory behind it, the union is now pushing to have
the city give the extra noise pay to workers in other departments,
which the city opposes, Butcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant City Attorney Les Brown, who represented the city in
Fowler's case, could not be reached for comment, nor could other
officials or spokesmen in the City Attorney's Office. The Mayor's
Office did not respond to a phone call seeking comment on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Michael Feuer, chairman of the city's Budget and
Finance Committee, said he had not been briefed on the issue and
had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first I've heard of this,'' he said Saturday. ``I
really want to sit down and review this case before I make a
judgment on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler, a city employee for 12 years, still works in the Bureau
of Street Services where he runs skiploaders, backhoes and other
large equipment. He said he hopes his co-workers, former co-workers
and the survivors of deceased co-workers will apply for the dollars
they are owed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really exciting,'' he said. ``There were a lot of
people who are affected. It's a very big deal. The impact is
tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, there will be a deadline to apply for the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern is making sure others know about this. Once I
sign, they will only allow a 60- to 90-day window for people to
come forward and file claims against the city. After that window,
they won't accept additional claims from people in our
department.''

LOS ANGELES WILL PAY STREET CREWS NOISE BONUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The city and a city employees union are putting
the final touches on an agreement forcing Los Angeles to pay as
much as $2 million in back wages to hundreds of workers eligible
for bonuses since 1992 because of workplace noise, according to
labor sources.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, involving about 300 street-repair workers, is expected
to unleash a flood of applications from employees in other city
departments, from the airport to tree trimmers, who are subjected
to ear-splitting racket on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The city fought to avoid paying the 5.5 percent premium after a
San Fernando Valley street-resurfacing employee first filed a claim
for it in 1992. But the city lost in court and also lost when an
arbitrator issued his final ruling in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that I was entitled to it,'' said Paul Fowler, who
operated street-resurfacing machinery in 1992 when he learned of
the bonus provision in city regulations and applied for the extra
pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city just flatly rejected it. They said no, nobody's ever
gotten that. I took that as a challenge,'' said Fowler, 43, of
suburban Winnetka, who now is a heavy equipment operator for the
city.
</P>
<P>
   This week, city officials and representatives of Service
Employees International Union, Local 347, will hold another in a
series of meetings to finish writing the agreement, already having
completed negotiations over who will receive the back pay and how
much they will get, according to sources familiar with the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The city anticipates paying half the settlement, or roughly $1
million, to workers in November and making the second and final
payout in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Butcher, general manager of SEIU Local 347, AFL-CIO, said
the union filed a group grievance on behalf of Fowler and other
street-service employees which led to the long, drawn-out legal
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are eligible for the additional 5.5 percent pay if their
work places them in an area where noise exceeds 85 decibels during
more than half of the employee's work shift, according to city
regulations cited by arbitrator Kenneth N. Silbert.
</P>
<P>
   City officials conducted tests after Fowler made his claim and
found that street resurfacing crews routinely were subjected to
even more noise than the 85-decibel level while on the job.
</P>
<P>
   But the city insisted it shouldn't have to pay the premium since
it provided earplugs and other devices to shield workers' ears and
regularly provided hearing tests to find out whether workers were
experiencing any problems.
</P>
<P>
   However, the arbitrator concluded that a noisy workplace is, in
itself, sufficient to warrant the higher pay, based on the wording
of the city regulation.

ARENA ADS A BONANZA FOR AGENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NENA BAKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The advertising agent for America West Arena earned at
least $5.2 million in commissions from 1992 to 1998, or about
three-quarters of a million more than Phoenix, which owns the
arena, received for the same period, city records show.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the agent, Terry Pugh of Paradise Valley, and Suns
President Jerry Colangelo formed a side deal, in violation of the
arena advertising agreement, that lasted for 28 months. City
officials were unaware of the joint venture until asked about it by
The Arizona Republic.
</P>
<P>
   After a review conducted by city auditors and outside legal
counsel, the city concluded the joint venture _ between JDMK LLC,
in which Colangelo is a principal, and Premier Sports Marketing
Inc., which was owned by Pugh _ had no impact on revenue to the
city. Officials do not plan to seek sanctions, said Jerry Geiger,
deputy director of the Community &AMP; Economic Development Department.
</P>
<P>
   But the business alliance between Pugh and Colangelo, which
began in April 1996 and ended in August 1998, according to Arizona
Corporation Commission records, raises more questions about the
city's stewardship of its $102 million downtown arena.
</P>
<P>
   The city owns the arena and functions as landlord for the Suns,
the primary tenant. The Suns run the day-to-day arena operations
and the city gets a small share of revenue after expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Phoenix Coyotes notified the city that the hockey
franchise would leave the arena unless disputes with the Suns over
financial matters, including advertising revenues that Pugh plays a
role in determining, could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Coyotes, who bring about three-quarters of a million
fans a season to downtown Phoenix, intend to leave America West
Arena by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Previous reports in The Republic have documented how a big chunk
of the $152.5 million the Suns have promised the city in shared
profits is slated to be paid out in the last 10 years of the Suns'
40-year lease. But this raises doubts the city will ever see the
big bucks promised by the Suns because of an escape clause that
allows the team to vacate the arena after 30 years _ if the
facility is deemed obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo and Pugh, whose contract with the arena extends to
2002, said they formed their venture to give Pugh more contacts and
capital to woo new clients. They said the company was kept separate
from Premier, which had the agreement for services at America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine the conflict if we had done it any other
way?'' Colangelo said. &QL; 
THE `WIN-WIN' SITUATION
</P>
<P>
   The Suns and the city created a public-private partnership in
1989 in order to build a new arena for the NBA franchise. &QL; 
In his 1999 book, How You Play the Game, Colangelo describes it as
a ``prototype for how a municipality and a sports franchise could
put a deal together that would provide a win-win situation for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Suns and Pugh have emerged as bigger winners than
the city, which contributed $48 million toward the cost of the
arena while the Suns pitched in $54 million.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the city has received a total of $4.4 million in rent
plus its share of cash flow as an advance against future profits
from such operations as parking, signs, concessions, suite licenses
and event rental, according to city records. That's 3.5 percent of
what the city hopes to realize over the life of the Suns' lease.
</P>
<P>
   The city, which has twice audited arena operations, does not
have an employee devoted to full-time oversight of its arena
interests. Geiger said he doesn't believe one is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we put the deals together 10 years ago, we took a lot of
time to enumerate the basic ongoing responsibilities of contract
compliance and information exchange,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With those guidelines in hand, Geiger said ``to have somebody
doesn't make a lot of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But the city's oversight has been lax. For example, questions
raised in June 1998 by city auditors about arena operations were
overlooked until earlier this month, prompted by inquiries by The
Republic.PROVISIONS STAND OUT
</P>
<P>
   Arena documents are about as thick as the Phoenix White Pages
and make about as interesting reading. But the provisions dealing
with advertising revenues stand out.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the 1989 deal with the city, the Suns
organization is allowed to sell all commercial advertising for the
arena, provided the Suns retain an independent advertising agent
who can look after the city's financial interests in sign revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement outlines a compensation schedule for the
independent advertising agent, Pugh's company, that industry
observers describe as a sweetheart deal.
</P>
<P>
   It also allows the Suns and Pugh to determine dollar allocations
within sponsorship packages that affect revenue to the city and the
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the advertising agreement gives the Suns and
Pugh the ability to carve up sponsorship packages in whatever way
they choose. They set the dollar allocations for TV, radio, cable,
public address announcements and signs within each package.
</P>
<P>
   A complex formula the parties agreed to in 1989 spells out how
arena revenues are distributed. But a key point is that sign
revenues are the only sponsorship money in which the city and the
Coyotes, who became a secondary arena tenant in 1996, are entitled
to share.
</P>
<P>
   All other advertising sponsorship revenues go directly to the
Suns affiliate that operates the arena. In turn, the operator is
obligated to pay the Suns 60 percent of advertising revenues in
consideration for services performed by the team.
</P>
<P>
   Under this arrangement, the Suns organization pays the agent _
and itself _ for selling sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Meyer, an attorney who represented the city in the original
arena negotiations, said the city insisted on having a watchdog
over sign revenues. An independent agent could make sure the Suns
did not bundle advertising sponsorships in a way that diluted the
value of the ad-sign component to the city, said Meyer, who is now
president of Eller Media Co., an outdoor sign company.
</P>
<P>
   Another protection for the city, Meyer said, was a provision
stating that the agent would be paid solely on the amount of sign
revenues within sponsorship packages. That way, the agent's
financial interests become identical to the city's.
</P>
<P>
   When Pugh and the Suns sell a sponsorship package that includes
radio, TV, cable and signs, ``I don't get paid on anything but the
signage,'' Pugh said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pugh's deal with the Suns, negotiated directly between the
two parties with no city input, pays him commissions that escalate
to 25 percent of gross sign revenues in excess of $1.6 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   That's well above arrangements in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten to 18 percent commissions are dead in the heart of the
typical range,'' said Dean Bonham, president of a sports-business
consulting company called the Bonham Group and a former president
of the Denver Nuggets. ``Twenty-five percent is rarely paid, and if
you get to that range, you've got to think it would be considerably
less expensive to take it in-house.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the dollar mark at which Pugh's commissions top out
should serve as an incentive to the agent to maximize sales. Pugh
said his original projections indicated the Suns would be lucky to
achieve $1 million a year in sign revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the team has done much better than that ever since
the arena opened. Last year, the arena grossed $4.7 million in sign
revenues, and Pugh's agency received about $981,000 in commissions,
according to calculations based on city records.
</P>
<P>
   And because Pugh's commissions are based on gross sign revenues,
his agency gets paid before any other arena operator obligations,
including payments for operating expenses, debt service and the
arena renewal and replacement fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a million dollars a year that's taken out of the
stream,'' said Shawn Hunter, Coyotes president.
</P>
<P>
   Although this arrangement has raised some eyebrows in the world
of sports marketing, city auditors last year questioned another
aspect of the arena advertising agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors could see no guidelines for how the Suns and Pugh
determined sign revenue allocations within advertising sponsorship
packages.
</P>
<P>
   They asked for more information from the operator and the
advertising agent to help them determine the accuracy and fairness
of allocations.
</P>
<P>
   After inquiries by The Republic about the status of the
auditors' requests, Suns representatives met earlier this month
with the city and provided auditors with more information.
</P>
<P>
   City auditors then reviewed 114 advertising contracts and wrote
a report on Sept. 17. In it, they concluded ``that advertising
allocations have been reasonable and consistent.'' &QL; 
INNOVATIONS WORTH MILLIONS &QL; 
All those familiar with Pugh's work say that Pugh has conceived of
ways to make money out of sponsorship packages that had never
before been tried in sports facilities. His innovation ultimately
brought him millions and piqued Colangelo's business interests.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Corporation Commission records show that Colangelo's
investment company and Pugh's agency organized a joint venture in
April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The venture was dissolved in August 1998, records show. But Pugh
and Colangelo said their alliance ended in April 1998. At that
time, said Jay Ruffner, a lawyer for Colangelo, the parties agreed
that Pugh would buy out Colangelo's company for $1.5 million,
approximately the amount that Colangelo and his partners had
originally invested.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, Pugh sold Premier to Outdoor Systems Inc., a
Phoenix-based billboard giant, for $26.4 million. Premier is now
known as Outdoor Systems Sports Marketing Inc. Pugh is a consultant
for that business.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffner acknowledged that Colangelo did not inform the city of
his partnership with Pugh. But he said Colangelo and Pugh weren't
trying to hide their partnership from the city. He called the
situation a ``technical violation'' of the advertising agreement
that occurred because of an oversight by his law firm, Fennemore
Craig.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was absolutely no impropriety,'' he said, adding that he
was ``100 percent certain'' that city officials would have OK'd the
partnership had it been brought to their attention.
</P>
<P>
   Modifications to the advertising agreements made when the
Coyotes became an arena tenant diminished Pugh's watchdog role,
Ruffner said. Under such circumstances, Ruffner said, he could
think of no reason why the city would have objected to the joint
venture.
</P>
<P>
   Pugh said he is comfortable with the joint venture, even in
light of his watchdog role for the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is: `Was there a conflict for any reason?' '' Pugh
said. His answer: ``That had all been thought about and everything
was saying (no).'' &QL; 
COYOTES CONCESSSION
</P>
<P>
   When the Coyotes signed on to play at America West Arena, the
team struck its own advertising agreement with the Suns and Pugh.
</P>
<P>
   The original 1989 agreement, which spells out Pugh's watchdog
role, still remains in place. But as a concession to the Coyotes, a
franchise that was coming into a facility where all the revenues
were spoken for by the Suns, the parties agreed to give the hockey
franchise any increases in existing sign revenues over the base
year of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few caveats:
</P>
<P>
   Advertising contracts that had escalator clauses built in were
excluded from the arrangement so that the Suns could retain the
benefit of deals they negotiated before hockey arrived. This
limited the number of contracts that would provide revenue to the
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   And to establish a baseline accounting of existing sign
revenues, the parties retained an independent accounting firm,
Arthur Andersen LLC, which relied on the sponsorship allocations
made earlier by the Suns and Pugh to come up with a figure.
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter, the Coyotes president, maintains that since then,
sign revenue increases within sponsorship packages have not
reflected the value of the 700,000 to 800,000 sign-viewing fans
that hockey brings to the arena each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A realistic amount for the advertising increase should be at
least $1.5 million'' over the base year, Hunter wrote in a letter
to city officials last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes have received less than $200,000 in signage
increases for their first year at the arena and nothing since
because of unresolved disputes over the amount of the payments,
Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Work done by city auditors seems to bear out the Coyotes
concerns that the value of sign allocations has not changed with
the presence of the hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   City auditors calculated a net increase in sign allocations that
amounted to $195,646 from 1996 to 1997, and $29,710 from 1997 to
1998, according to audit files. Out of 139 signs, there were 18
changes in 1997, and 14 changes in 1998 that resulted in new
allocations, the auditors found.
</P>
<P>
   From 1996 to 1998, the percentage of sign revenue included in
sponsorship packages remained nearly constant at 23 percent to 24
percent, auditors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, we saw a slight upward slope in sign
revenues,'' said Randy Spenla, the city auditor who conducted the
recent review. ``We did not see anything to indicate that sign
revenues were significantly higher with the Coyotes in the
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo maintains that the Coyotes have benefited from a
sweetheart lease and other concessions. One such example: The
hockey team keeps all the revenues from signs it sells around the
second level of the arena bowl. He said complaints by the Coyotes
are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   But Colangelo was less than pleased when the hockey team turned
down an offer from Premier Sports Marketing LLC, Pugh and
Colangelo's joint venture, to represent the Coyotes as the team's
agent for signs at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   For the Coyotes, another sticking point at the arena is the
increase in the number of exclusive advertising-rights categories
sold by the Suns. One way to enhance the value of sponsorships is
to have only one soft-drink company or bank, for example, allowed
to advertise.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter told the city that the granting of exclusives
significantly limits the number and types of advertisers available
to the Coyotes and led to $2 million in lost revenue in the 1997-98
season alone.
</P>
<P>
   But Colangelo said the Suns aren't trying to hurt the Coyotes by
adding exclusive categories of advertisers. Instead, he said, the
arena operator relies on that revenue to help meet the demands of
operating expenses, debt service payments, refurbishment and other
calls on net cash flow that the Coyotes, as a secondary tenant,
don't have.
</P>
<P>
   With the two sides at an impasse, the Coyotes intend to pack
their pucks and move to Scottsdale, pending financing and voter
support for a proposed new arena that would anchor a redeveloped
Los Arcos Mall.
</P>
<P>
   And if they go to Scottsdale at the end of the 2000 season, the
Coyotes are obligated to pay the Suns $2.5 million as a termination
fee.
</P>
<P>
   The money, according to the city, would be treated as arena
revenue in which the city shares.
</P>
<P>
   City records include copies of two letters from Sheryl Sculley,
assistant city manager, to the Coyotes. In November 1998, Sculley
assured the Coyotes that ``the city of Phoenix wants the Phoenix
Coyotes to continue to play hockey in America West Arena.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're anxious to work with you and the arena management to
ensure that you continue to play hockey in downtown Phoenix,''
Sculley said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter said the city can only take things so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be the owner,'' Hunter said, ``but they're not the
operator, and at some point it's out of their hands.'' &QL; 
NO RESTRUCTURING SOUGHT &QL; 
In hindsight, it appears city officials weren't holding the
sharpest of pencils when it came to signing up for a deal that
wasn't more precise about how advertising sponsorship allocations
would be determined.
</P>
<P>
   But city officials said they have not asked the Suns and Pugh to
restructure the advertising agreement, which might bring Pugh's
commissions in line with current market rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact the independent agent has been successful is a
positive for the city, not a negative,'' Geiger said. ``The agent
has contributed significantly to the fact that gross advertising
revenues from the arena have far exceeded all projections.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo, who agreed to revise the arena operating agreement in
1994 to increase the city's share of cash flow, said he is not
inclined to restructure the agreement with Premier.
</P>
<P>
   ``To change the deal because we pay out a lot of commissions,
that's unfair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, he does not expect the arena operator to renew
its contract with Premier, now Outdoor Systems Sports Marketing
Inc., when it expires in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, however, remains troubled by the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's either the stupidest business deal in the world,'' he
said, ``or something funny is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Pugh disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   The way he sees it, Premier's work at America West ``set a lot
of firsts'' in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   He said he contributed designs, carved out sponsorship packages
and ``floated the whole thing'' for three years before Premier
received its first commission payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a bad deal for somebody to do,'' he said. ``I'm not
ashamed of that or I don't feel bad about it. If you look at the
dollar figures, it makes sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruffner, Colangelo's lawyer, said Pugh's commissions now seem
outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we any inkling how profitable it would be, I don't think
we would have given Terry the deal we did,'' Ruffner said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Pugh's joint venture with Colangelo, Ruffner said no
conflict existed that would have been detrimental to the city or
the Coyotes. Ruffner said the modifications to the advertising
agreement that took place when the Coyotes arrived at the arena
made the hockey team the beneficiary of all new sign revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think you might get some great big scandal because
there was money being funneled off into somebody's pocket, all that
money belonged to hockey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said the issue for the Coyotes is that the franchise is
getting ``squeezed on both ends,'' which, he added, may have
something to do with the partnership between Colangelo and Pugh.
</P>
<P>
   On one end, ``we're not seeing as much of an increase over
baseline (sign) revenues as common sense says we would,'' Hunter
said. On the other end, the Suns are selling more exclusive
advertising categories all the time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're not very smart and signed up for a bad deal,''
Hunter said. ``Or maybe it's an odd partnership.'' &QL;

PARKING SPACE WARS PIT BIG VS. LITTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA TRUJILLO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In these acres of asphalt in this central Phoenix
parking lot, Karen Owens circles the rows of cars, searching for
the perfect spot wide enough to fit her Ford Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   She sandwiches the Explorer between two other sport-utility
vehicles and gingerly edges out, carefully holding the door to
avoid dings and to keep from brushing her tiger-print blouse on the
dirty Blazer just 18 inches from her.
</P>
<P>
   This is about big cars in small spots.
</P>
<P>
   As vehicles continue to expand _ Ford's newest, the Excursion,
could be used as a small bus _ and parking spots have shrunk to
compact sizes (more cars per row equal more shoppers in the store),
the battle between the SUV and the car has developed into its own
asphalt class warfare. Big Vehicle drivers circle and circle,
enviously eyeing the munchkin spot at the end. Little Car drivers
prowl around, seeking those nooks and crannies, hoping they won't
be squashed like bugs when they try to climb out of their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, an advertising executive from Phoenix, knows to say no to
compact spots. To avoid spaces next to the other mammoth cars that
encroach on her space. And how to find that special spot where she
can exit without holding her breath.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years she's developed these skills, as have the
hundreds of thousands of Americans who own pickups and SUVs. The
nation's desire to haul its children, dogs and home-improvement
projects clearly outstrips its need to use less gas and pave less
ground. And the nation's retailers, which over the years have
shrunk parking spaces by 6 to 12 inches, have only made the squeeze
tighter.
</P>
<P>
   So, it would seem that Phoenix's move this year to increase the
size of its average parking spot would solve everything. You'd
think that adding a half-foot of space would land us in parking
space paradise. Turns out, however, that this is about more than
door dings.
</P>
<P>
   It's about what we value in society and about what the car means
to us. It's the reality that, although we've pursued what we want _
the bigger, the perceived safer and better and more insular _ we've
run out of room. We've moved too close to the white line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always looking for the big parking space,'' says Linda
Lopez, who as a senior engineering technician for Phoenix reviews
and approves new parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't like those little ones, you try to get in them
and they're so small,'' says Lopez, who drives a very big Mercury
Grand Marquis. ``You can't get in. Then if you do, you can't get
out of your car.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix upped the parking spot by 6 inches, increasing the
standard spot at busy, commercial businesses to 9 feet by 18 feet,
which may not seem like much until you find yourself wedged between
two Suburbans.
</P>
<P>
   The compact spot, at a tight 7{ feet by 18, may all but
disappear in new Phoenix parking lots, added only after malls and
stores meet the required number of regular-size spots. The compact
spot was one of the remaining legacies of the energy crisis, a time
when America was taught to feel greedy and irresponsible if it got
anything less than 30 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the new spots to 9 feet lets Phoenix catch up to the
other freeway-dependent city of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, it leaves it behind Glendale, the city that never left
those gas-guzzling '60s and never adopted the mini, compact spot.
Glendale's monster spaces still reign, at 10 by 20 feet. Phoenix is
now more similarly sized to Chandler, Scottsdale and Mesa, and even
a little bigger than Tempe, which at 8{ feet is now the stingiest.
</P>
<P>
   The differences are not lost on Molly Hood, a planner for
Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my apartment complex in Phoenix the spots are so tiny, my
doors are constantly getting bumped,'' says Hood, who drives a
little Plymouth Laser. ``But in Glendale, in Glendale the spots are
huge. You can tell when you pull in.''
</P>
<P>
   Although parking spot size may be a big concern, mall managers
don't see it as priority, especially after seeing would-be shoppers
circling their lots at Christmastime and realizing that shaving a
few inches off each spot translates into a few more spots for
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always are talking about how there's not enough
parking,'' says Paul Sauer, vice president and general manager of
Arizona Mills mall. ``No one ever complains that the spot isn't big
enough. They're just happy they find one.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is true to a point. But drivers of Big Cars and Small
still often will skip spots where a Big Vehicle is too close to the
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want any spot where I have to squeeze to get out,''
Owens says.
</P>
<P>
   And Katrina Murray often finds herself parking her minivan
off-center, simply to accommodate a Big Vehicle next to her,
forcing her to become an enabler to the Big Vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the spot is too narrow and a car is too close, you have to
scoot over,'' says Murray, 35, from Chandler. ``You don't want to
hit any doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Kohler tries her best to always park her Suburban
exactly in the middle, leaving as much room as she can to
accommodate smaller cars. She feels she has no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get into the spot, you can fit in, but then, you can't
really get out,'' says Kohler, noticing the slim foot of space left
after carefully parking the Suburban (two tries). ``It's bad. Bad
for me and bad for the little cars, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohler turns sideways as she climbs out of her Big Vehicle, the
silhouette of her five-months pregnant belly barely visible.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to one other, pressing issue. Cars keep getting
bigger, but so are we. No, we aren't all five months pregnant, but
studies say Americans are bigger than we've ever been; movie
theaters and sports stadiums are increasing their seat width and
restaurants are enlarging their booths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm wondering what it will be like in a few months. Will I
fit?'' she wonders. ``Will it just add to the challenge?'' &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - The story of how David E. Kelley named the private
detective agency in his new show, Snoops, tells you something about
how his mind works.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Glenn Hall agency. Hall was a hockey player. So, one
might assume, this is an homage to him.
</P>
<P>
   No. This is why Kelley, creator of the Emmy-winning Ally McBeal
and The Practice, is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glenn Hall is the one who let Bobby Orr score to win the
Stanley Cup for the Bruins,'' Kelley, a big hockey fan, said this
summer. ``Bobby Orr was my favorite hockey player. I always like to
give credit to the one who helped out.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that anecdote is a lot more interesting than
Snoops is.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley is television's golden boy. Ally McBeal and The Practice
won Emmys for best comedy and best drama this year _ the only time
one producer has been so honored for his work. He famously writes
nearly every word of both shows (a rarity in TV writing), longhand,
on a legal pad. (He's a former lawyer; old habits are hard to
break.)
</P>
<P>
   And he knocks off by 6 p.m. ev ery day so as to spend time with
his wife and children. His wife is Mi chelle Pfeiffer. Excellent
placement of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Snoops won't tarnish Kelley's reputation _ it would take a
Robert Downey Jr.-type meltdown to do that. But it won't add any
polish to his sheen, either.
</P>
<P>
   It stars Gina Gershon and Paula Marshall as unconventional
private detectives. They're a couple of red-hot babes.
</P>
<P>
   Hold the phone before you brand me a sexist pig. Their
attractiveness is a big part of the story. In fact, when Marshall's
character, a (rela tively) straight-laced police officer looking
for a job, shows up at Ger shon's door, Gershon sounds disap
pointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize,'' she says, ``but over the phone you sounded less
at tractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gershon and Marshall and their cronies use all sorts of
high-tech gizmos in their work. How, one might ask, can Gershon's
character afford such expensive toys? By once promising to have sex
with a man who kidnapped a billionaire's kid, we're told.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, I got the kid back when the police couldn't,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   I don't recall Sgt. Friday using that particular technique.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Snoops snoops use all manner of unconventional
ploys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bug people,'' Gershon ex plains to a skeptical Marshall.
``We break into their houses. We steal their Social Security
numbers. We're not police. We have more in com mon with the
criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   They also have more in common with Charlie's Angels than Ally
McBeal or The Practice.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of leering and flirting in Snoops. It's the only
show I've ever seen that makes use of, and I'm quoting Gershon
here, a ``nipplecam.''
</P>
<P>
   The best chance Snoops has for survival is as a guilty pleasure.
With the emphasis on guilt, not pleasure. Kelley's association and
leading into The Practice will only attract view ers for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Snoops is a nice companion piece with The
Practice because it is so different,'' Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   It is different. The Practice is ac tually good. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other new Sunday night shows:
</P>
<P>
   Third Watch: Although there is plenty of action, plenty of plots
and plenty of actors in this ensemble, the much-hyped drama from
John Wells, of ER fame, doesn't measure up to his previous hit. The
charac ters just don't mesh. This is actually a bad sign for ER _
it makes you realize how much that show de pends on chemistry to
work. With George Clooney gone and Julianna Margulies and Gloria
Reuben going after this season, the prognosis is grave.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm in the Middle: By far the best new Sunday night show.
Frankie Muniz is great as the title character, a sort-of normal kid
who is discovered to be a genius. So why haven't you heard more
about it? Because Fox isn't debuting its best new show till
January, after football. Guess there's no danger of the net work
bigwigs being revealed as ge niuses anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Jack and Jill: Young adults struggle to grow up. This is the WB,
so young beautiful adults, nat urally. But you could have guessed
that. The twist: Jack's a woman, Jill's a man. Act surprised. &QL;

PHOENIX - They're the Osmond Brothers of the National League. In
the rock and roll world of profes sional sports, they're Lawrence
Welk. If the Arizona Diamondbacks were a television show, it'd be
Father Knows Best. If they were a book, it'd be the Boy Scout
manual.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As individuals, on and off the field, they're all very good, all
very nice. And because they won their division and may go all the
way this year, sports writers and TV commentators across America
want to know why they're not hearing frenzied shouts of joy from
Diamondbacks faithful.
</P>
<P>
   To which I'd respond, ``Shhhhhh. You'll wake them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe we lack fervor because the team is new.
They say folks in Phoenix haven't had enough time to build a
relationship with the Diamondbacks and, therefore, have no sense of
emotional attachment.
</P>
<P>
   That's not true.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe the team, as well as the city, hasn't
``suffered'' enough. They say by becoming a contender in only its
second year of operation, the Diamondbacks have spoiled us, al
lowed us to become apathetic.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't it, either.
</P>
<P>
   Still more theorists hold that base ball isn't what it used to
be, or that it's difficult for regular folks to relate to teams
nowadays because players come and go, or even that the more
contested division races are getting all the attention.
</P>
<P>
   No. No. And no.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it'd be best for all concerned if this needless
conjecture simply stopped. But I'm afraid it won't.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, they won't let sleeping fans lie. &QL;

So, we might as well admit it. This absolutely fabulous baseball
team, this (yawn) record-setting champion ship contender, this . .

little . . . zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz . . .
</P>
<P>
   Dull.
</P>
<P>
   It was destined to be so. From the very beginning, Diamondbacks'
Managing General Partner Jerry Co langelo said he wanted players
with ``character.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Diamondbacks analyst Bob Brenly said, ``(Critics) were
thinking the Diamondbacks were way off base. But you can have both,
good players with good character.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure you can. But why?
</P>
<P>
   Guys in the real world not only tolerate a little bad behavior
from professional athletes, we COUNT on it. How can we live
vicariously through a bunch of millionaire jocks who behave like _
us?
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking, for example, of players like former pitching great
Tug McGraw, who, when asked if he preferred AstroTurf or grass,
report edly replied, ``I don't know. I never smoked AstroTurf.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson scowls, but only at batters. Brian Anderson
appears mis chievous, but in an innocent, boyish way.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have real charac ter, but no real characters.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the team features a bunch of kind, hard-working, really

<P>
   ``All work and no play makes Jack a professional prospect in
Arizona.'' &QL; 
REMEMBER SUNS FEVER?
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, 300,000 screaming fans swarmed downtown
Phoenix in the blazing heat to celebrate the Suns basketball team.
They did so for three reasons.
</P>
<P>
   1. The team almost won a champion ship. 2. Charles. 3. Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying we want guys like that on our baseball team, only
that the press shouldn't panic because Arizonans who suffered
initially from ``baseball fever'' appear to have slipped into a
coma.
</P>
<P>
   We're happy with the Diamond backs. We shelled out over 200
million bucks for the team's stadium, for which we were promised a
winner. Now, we have no reason to complain.

ROQUES' ROCKY DAY IS HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ How does it feel to get beaten on the longest
pass play in Pacific-10 history?
</P>
<P>
   UCLA safety Ryan Roques wants a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Roques, who spent much of Saturday's 42-32 loss to Stanford at
his former position, cornerback, desperately tried to contain
Cardinal receiver Troy Walters. He failed.
</P>
<P>
   Walters caught nine passes for 278 yards and three touchdowns.
Of course, they weren't all against Roques _ just the one everyone
will remember.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA was in zone coverage on the play, so Roques started toward
the tight end. Then he saw Walters break free, moving right to
left, but he arrived too late to defend the pass. Walters caught it
and outran Roques to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Walters also beat Roques on an 18-yard touchdown pass late in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself making big plays, but I didn't get it done like I
think I should have,'' he said. ``It was a little tough at
cornerback, but I have no excuses. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Walters made a lot of big plays. A lot were against me and a
lot were against other cornerbacks. I wish I could play him again,
because I think I would have a better game than had today at
cornerback.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems each season the Bruins' secondary is in disarray.
Junior cornerback Marques Anderson has been suspended for the fall
quarter, and senior cornerback Jason Bell is out with a heel
injury.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, two freshmen, Joe Hunter and Ricky Manning, were
left to combat Stanford's potent passing attack.
</P>
<P>
   After Hunter was beaten repeatedly by Walters, Roques moved over
and reserve Eric Whitfield took Roques' safety spot.
</P>
<P>
   The changes did little good, but until Bell returns, the Bruins
have few options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason could help us,'' Roques said. ``But once again, I'm a
fifth-year senior, and I should be able to make the plays wherever
they need to be made. I've got to have a better game than this at
whatever position I play.''

ALL IS WELL WITH NEBRASKA _ AT LEAST FOR A WEEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. _ Considering that the streak stretched to 21
consecutive Nebraska victories over Missouri, the snapshot reaction
is ``Big deal. Doesn't Nebraska always beat Missouri?''
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't your father's _ or even your older sibling's _
Nebraska. Sure, the Cornhuskers slapped down a hopeful Mizzou team
that really, really, really, ``really'' believed it could pull off
the upset. Nebraska 40, Missouri 10 continued the Huskers'
dominance in this series. The Tigers' last victory came in 1978 in
Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   After two woulda-coulda-shoulda losses to Nebraska the past two
seasons, Missouri was jazzed and geeked for this game. Fans were in
position three hours before kickoff. Traffic construction signs on
I-70 flashed ``Expect Delays. Go Mizzou.'' The Tigers' ``We
Believe'' attitude was buttressed by the belief that these
Cornhuskers were vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   And that's because Team Turmoil had totaled 486 yards in offense
in its past two games. In the season's first month, a quarterback
controversy evolved into a quarterback change and a go-to running
back became a left-the-team running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since two-a-days started, it's been one thing after
another,'' junior wide receiver Matt Davison said. ``This is the
first week we really haven't had any controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   And last night, they didn't get a game from the Tigers (2-1).
The Huskers' first 16 points arrived in Black and Gold packaging.
Consecutive high snaps on punts and an interception staked Nebraska
to a 16-0 lead in the first quarter. And, with Missouri alternating
two inexperienced quarterbacks, the Tigers were incapable of
mounting a serious rally. Missouri entered the game second
nationally in rushing with 310 yards per game; it finished with 25
rushing yards and 174 total yards.
</P>
<P>
   In his second season, Frank Solich has the Huskers 4-0 and
ranked No. 6. National championship hopes are still intact. The
defense, which is ranked ninth nationally, is capable of shutting
down any opponent.
</P>
<P>
   And give Solich credit for admitting a mistake that had hobbled
his offense. Choosing Bobby Newcombe over Eric Crouch at
quarterback was wrong. After two games, Solich reversed his field
better than Johnny Rodgers on a punt return. With Crouch at
quarterback, the Huskers have someone who understands the sleight
of hand needed to run the option.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no guarantee that Nebraska's traditional
grind-out-the-yards running game is present and accounted for. The
Huskers finished with 333 yards rushing and 446 yards in total
offense, but they had to pass to set up the run; five of their
first 11 plays were passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed the kind of offense we can be tonight,'' Davison
said. ``We're not one dimensional. In the past, we could run the
ball and it didn't matter what the other team did. We can't block
nine defenders with six. We realized we needed to mix it up a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this season, the Huskers got 100 yards from a
back. Junior Correll Buckhalter, a career backup, gained 132 _ and
57 yards came late in the third quarter against the run-down
Tigers. Crouch is the team's leading rusher with 245 yards. Can the
Huskers' challenge for a national title _ or even the Big 12
Conference crown _ without a quality I-back?
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, you want a very good line and very good running
backs,'' Solich said. ``If you don't have one of those, you're in
trouble. We've got good linemen, good backs and good receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelo Evans was expected to be this season's I-back star, but
he spit the bit and quit the team in a huff. He left complaining of
conspiracies and being neglected. Heaped on top of the quarterback
switch, Evans' inelegant exit created quite a stir among the
Children of the Corn. Slapping down the Tigers by 30 points helped
restore order. For one game, at least.

TCU RIDES TOMLINSON'S CAREER-HIGH 269 YARDS TO NARROW VICTORY ON
ROAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JONESBORO, Ark. _ TCU football coach Dennis Franchione walked up
the locker room steps last night and looked straight in the eyes of
running back LaDainian Tomlinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I give you the ball enough tonight?'' Franchione asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sure did,'' Tomlinson said. ``I appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs are thankful for Tomlinson today, because the
5-foot-11 junior running back carried them to their first victory
of the season, 24-21, against Arkansas State at Indian Field with
his finest night as a Frogs player. Tomlinson finished with a
career-high 269 yards on a TCU all-time high of 40 carries. He also
scored two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson's 79-yard touchdown run on the first play from
scrimmage was the longest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they handed to me the first five plays of the game, I
knew what the game was going to be like,'' Tomlinson said. ``I knew
the game plan. It was to run me. I knew I had to have a big game.
It was fun, then the defense stepped up for us late.''
</P>
<P>
   Just when it looked as if TCU (1-2) would pull away from the
winless Indians (0-4) after taking a 21-7 lead in the first
quarter, the Frogs needed defense and Tomlinson again in the fourth
quarter to get the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas State, which got 155 yards from sophomore running back
Jonathan Adams, scored two touchdowns in the second quarter to get
within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 24-14, the Indians recovered a LaVar Veale fumble on a
punt to take possession at the TCU 15-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   A pass interference call against TCU turned an incomplete pass
on third-and-12 into a first-and-goal at the 2. After a rushing
play for a loss, ASU quarterback Cleo Lemon hit Jacquis Walker in
the left side of the end zone for the touchdown to cut the lead to
24-21 with 2:46 left in half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm especially proud of the way we played defense in the
second half,'' Arkansas State coach Joe Hollis said. ``I've seen
14-point spreads turn to 28-point spreads and that didn't happen
with this football team. I'm sorry we're 0-4.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team, including the 18-point favorites from TCU, moved
the ball effectively in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Frogs needed two defensive stands in the fourth
quarter, they got both. TCU stopped Arkansas State at midfield
early in the quarter with an interception by Terrance Maiden. The
Indians' next drive was stopped by sacks from Aaron Schobel and
Maiden.
</P>
<P>
   TCU got the ball within the final two minutes with a chance to
run out the clock deep in their own territory.
</P>
<P>
   On third-and-eight from their own 19, the Frogs handed to
Tomlinson. He picked up 9 yards for the first down. By the time TCU
did have to punt, only 19 seconds remained. Arkansas State tried
three sideline passes, but all were defended and incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   A final pass deep down the field with two seconds left was
batted down by the Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that 21-7 was not comfortable,'' Franchione said. ``We
knew we needed to score more points. When we didn't score the first
time or two in the third quarter, I was a little worried because we
hadn't slowed them down much either.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RLaDainian\S played very well. The last first down we got was
a great effort by him. He had a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson had three rushes of more than 30 yards nullified by
penalties. Overall, TCU had 14 penalties for 135 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Penalties have hurt us some this year,'' Franchione said. ``We
rip off a big gain, then all of a sudden it's coming back. It's
something we've got to address.''

RANGERS A WIN AWAY FROM AL WEST TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The defending American League West champions
sent their overachieving challengers from Oakland face-first into
the canvas for the second time in as many evenings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics should be reminded that the three-knockdown rule
is in effect. Only an A's.MDRV/[ .MDNM/-whoopin'.MDRV/]
victory.MDNM/ this afternoon separates the Rangers from clinching
their third AL West title since 1996. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers reduced their magic number to one with last night's
10-4 victory at The Ballpark in Arlington, and their eight-run
second inning _ consummated by Todd Zeile's grand slam off
right-hander Kevin Appier (15-14) _ forced the A's to return to
their corner for yet another standing-eight count. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to come in and play better than we did,'' said
left fielder Rusty Greer, who alluded to the Rangers' four losses
in five games to the sub-.500 Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Baltimore
Orioles earlier during this homestand. ``We knew this was a big
series, and we wanted to play our brand of baseball.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have, and it should come as no surprise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the real test of this team has been how we play
against the tough teams that are winning,'' said Zeile, whose slam
gave the Rangers and right-hander John Burkett an insurmountable
six-run lead. ``When it comes time to strap it on, we seem to rise
to the occasion.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers did it.MDRV/[.MDNM/ during.MDRV/] in.MDNM/ September
1998 with five consecutive victories against the Anaheim Angels and
earlier this.MDRV/[.MDNM/ August.MDRV/] season.MDNM/ with 10
victories during a 13-game stretch against Cleveland, Boston, New
York and Toronto. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burkett (8-8) responded, too, after surrendering three runs (two
earned) before escaping the first inning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't looking good early, but I always have confidence

lot of help tonight. You can't underestimate the effect of the play
Mark McLemore made. That was the huge play in the game.'' &QL;

<P>
   McLemore robbed center fielder Rich Becker of a one-out,

RANGERS A WIN AWAY FROM AL WEST TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The defending American League West champions
sent their overachieving challengers from Oakland face-first into
the canvas for the second time in as many evenings.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics should be reminded that the three-knockdown rule
is in effect. Only an A's victory this afternoon separates the
Rangers from clinching their third AL West title since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers reduced their magic number to one with last night's
10-4 victory at The Ballpark in Arlington, and their eight-run
second inning _ consummated by Todd Zeile's grand slam off
right-hander Kevin Appier (15-14) _ forced the A's to return to
their corner for yet another standing-eight count.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to come in and play better than we did,'' said
left fielder Rusty Greer, who alluded to the Rangers' four losses
in five games to the sub-.500 Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Baltimore
Orioles earlier during this homestand. ``We knew this was a big
series, and we wanted to play our brand of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have, and it should come as no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the real test of this team has been how we play
against the tough teams that are winning,'' said Zeile, whose slam
gave the Rangers and right-hander John Burkett an insurmountable
six-run lead. ``When it comes time to strap it on, we seem to rise
to the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers did it in September 1998 with five consecutive
victories against the Anaheim Angels and earlier this season with
10 victories during a 13-game stretch against Cleveland, Boston,
New York and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett (8-8) responded, too, after surrendering three runs (two
earned) before escaping the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't looking good early, but I always have confidence
that I'm going to get the job done,'' Burkett said. ``I also had a
lot of help tonight. You can't underestimate the effect of the play
Mark McLemore made. That was the huge play in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   McLemore robbed center fielder Rich Becker of a one-out,
second-inning single with a diving stop and started a 4-6-3,
inning-ending double play. From there, Burkett coasted before
departing with a 10-3 lead after seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It responds to urgency,'' closer John Wetteland said. ``The
problem is if you rely on that, it will let you down _ most
assuredly. So, I'll take consistency over something like that. Now,
defending ourselves, we've \Rbeen consistent\S all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we needed this series. Yes, it's a case of us rising
to the occasion, but you can't rely on that only. You have to have
that we're-going-to-bash-your-brains-in-tonight attitude, too.''
</P>
<P>

after 12-4 and 10-4 losses the past two nights.

``we should have anyway. We should be where we are right now. I can
understand getting all excited about it and everything, but what
lies ahead is long and arduous.''

Europe's Junior, Jesper dance to a different beat
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ If you came upon them someplace other than
the snooty, manicured grounds of The Country Club, you might expect
them both to be riding skateboards.
</P>
<P>
   But as Europe seems to roll inexorably toward another convincing
Ryder Cup victory, Sergio Garcia and Jesper Parnevik are instead
the ones driving the steamroller. Junior and Jesper.
</P>
<P>
   Based on appearances, they are about as intimidating a pair as
Laverne and Shirley. One doesn't have his high school diploma and
the other wears the goofy hat that makes him look like he took a
wrong turn during the Tour de France. But together they're deadlier
than Smith &AMP; Wesson. The Kid and The Lid.
</P>
<P>
   They have teed it up twice each day in the team competition and
have come away with 3{ points out of a possible four in Europe's
10-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   They have been irrepressible and irresistible, with more magical
chemistry than Siegfried &AMP; Roy and, they too, know how to make a
Tiger disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to play with each other,'' said European captain
Mark James, the great stoneface. ``And the least I can do, really,
is to give them a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Few gave Garcia and Parnevik much chance to be the lead horses
pulling Europe's wagon. But for all the efforts of veteran Colin
Montgomerie and the notable Lee Westwood, it is Europe's version of
the Backstreet Boys who have given the team its bounce, its rhythm,
not to mention more than a few dance steps in the fairways.
</P>
<P>
   This time Parnevik and Garcia put down Justin Leonard and Payne
Stewart with a routine 3 and 2 thumping in the morning to run their
Ryder Cup records to a pair of perfect matching 3-0s. Then in the
afternoon they battled to a gritty square match with Davis Love III
and David Duval by using their usual bolts from the blue.
</P>
<P>
   The Kid and The Lid had fought back from an early two-hole
deficit and got to No. 12 looking like the wheels were ready to
come off. Neither managed to hit the fairway with his tee shot,
then Parnevik went into a bunker and fluffed his shot out, still 85
yards away. So he pulled out his sand wedge and struck another
arcing rainbow that found the pot of gold, rolling in for a 4 that
kept the match even.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had made a mess of that hole,'' Parnevik said. ``Then I saw
Sergio had a really tough chip shot himself to get up and down, so
I told my caddie, `It seems like we have to hole this one.' To see
it go in was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   It touched off another one of their spontaneous celebrations as
they danced like a pair of self-winding watches on the wrist of St.
Vitus.
</P>
<P>
   With these two, every hole is another potential disco. But that
is not to overlook they also play spectacular golf and are the
perfect complements to each other's personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's their best team,'' Love said. ``Every time they both
get on the green, one of them makes it. That's what we've been
saying about Ryder Cups the last three years, somebody like Sergio
that never had played before, holes a lot of putts or hits a lot of
great shots. There is not much luck involved on their side, it's
just great shots. I'm just glad we don't have to play them again.''
</P>
<P>
   When it wasn't Parnevik chipping or making a key putt, it was
Garcia sliding the sharp sword into el toro. And it was The Kid who
struck last. With Duval and Love 1-up on the 18th hole and
threatening to take a full point for the U.S. team, Garcia hit a
beauty of an 8-iron that settled in eight feet from the cup. Then
he nailed his birdie putt to win the hole and square the match. At
a time when every partial point was going to make an American
comeback today more possible, it was a critical turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia eats apples during a match; Parnevik, the son of a
comedian, gobbles volcanic dust, and they've erupted on the United
States like Vesuvius. At the 17th tee, Garcia hugged U.S. captain
Ben Crenshaw and kissed his wife, Julie.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I have fun, I play good golf,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sergio's been virtually a replacement for the young Seve
(Ballesteros),'' James said. ``When we were in the team room and
they showed him on a monitor, he said, `Look at this, the next
hole. Watch this.' And they didn't show the next hole. So he's
throwing things at the television. He's a live wire and I think
Jesper's looked after him fantastically because Jesper's been a
great check on him. But Sergio's personality is very charismatic
like Seve and he's definitely a force that this team has felt
positively.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kid and The Lid have put an overlapping grip on the Ryder
Cup. Go figure.

TEXAS CHASES BAYLOR, GHOSTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO _ All week Texas coach Mack Brown was regaled with tales of
weird things that had happened to past Longhorn teams in what
former UT coach David McWilliams once called the
Waco-Bruceville-Eddy Triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Brown merely snorted at the idea that Floyd Casey Stadium was
somehow haunted for Texas, which had lost nine of its past 12 games
in the city by the Brazos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is haunted,'' Brown said. ``I don't believe in that
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Bury that theory for the time being. Baylor didn't have a ghost
of a chance last night against the No. 22 Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Texas (4-1) won its Big 12 opener convincingly by scoring on six
of its first nine possessions on the way to a 62-0 victory that
left the Bears (0-4, 0-2) reeling after last week's 41-10 loss to
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Major Applewhite completed 26 of 37 passes for 333
yards and three touchdowns _ in three quarters. It was his third
300-yard game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offensive line did a phenomenal job,'' Applewhite said.
``I have one grass stain on my knee. And that was from taking a
knee watching Chris \RSimms\S play.''
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Hodges Mitchell followed his 188-yard performance
against Rice by gaining 131 yards on 22 carries _ including
first-half touchdown runs of three and 13 yards _ and also scored
on a 10-yard reception in the third quarter. Mitchell also did not
play in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably some things we'll see on film we need to
work on,'' Mitchell said. ``But it seemed like everything was
working pretty well tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas finished with 586 yards of total offense and its first
shutout in eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most complete game we've played in the last two
years,'' UT coach Mack Brown said. ``We got our first shutout since
'91 and that's a great selling point, especially when you're
playing your twos and threes in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Baylor is that bad,'' said cornerback Ervis
Hill, who had two interceptions. ``Coach Brown just did a really
good job of getting us pumped up. Before we got on the bus, he
showed us film of them tearing down the goalposts here two years
ago \Rafter a 23-21 victory\S. We didn't want them to do that
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite completed 17 of 23 passes in the first half for 231
yards. He threw scoring strikes of 14 yards to tight end Chris
Smith and 8 yards to Ryan Nunez _ ending drives of 80 and 58 yards
_ during a 28-point second quarter that buried the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas defense set up the first two second-quarter touchdowns
that broke open a 14-0 game after first-quarter marches of 80 and
53 yards that ended in short scoring runs by fullback Chris
Robertson and Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker De'Andre Lewis picked an Odell James pass out
of his gut at the Baylor 13-yard line on the first play of the
second quarter. Mitchell scored his second touchdown of the half on
the next play by cutting outside and breaking two tackles down the
right sideline.
</P>
<P>
   End Aaron Humphrey's jarring tackle separated Jermaine Alfred
from the ball midway of the quarter and linebacker Anthony Hicks
recovered at the Bears' 17. After Applewhite drilled Ryan Nunez for
a 10-yard gain on third and four from the 11, Robertson scored his
second touchdown for a 28-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Texas then drove 80, capped by Smith's scoring catch, and took
it 58 yards after Hill's second interception at the Texas 42,
leading to Nunez's touchdown reception three plays later. Kwame
Cavil (8 catches, 97 yards) took an Applewhite pass 37 yards to the
Baylor 8 for the big play in the drive.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite threw his final touchdown of the night to Mitchell
with 2:31 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have a snyopsis for this, other than the fact
that we are only 20 quarters into this process,'' Bears coach Kevin
Steele said.

Longhorns dominate all facets in 62-0 rout
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WACO _ This time there would be no miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of misery for sure, but no miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years after being the victim in the most celebrated
victory in the 100-year history of Baylor football, Texas found
redemption in giving the Bears one of their most embarrassing
losses ever.
</P>
<P>
   In a dominant performance, the Longhorns controlled every facet
of the game from the start and finished as strong as they started,
rolling to a 62-0 rout before 41,784 at Floyd Casey Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And just like after the Bears' 34-24 comeback victory over Texas
in 1974, subsequently dubbed the ``Miracle on the Brazos,'' those
who saw this year's game went away not believing what they had
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have a big synopsis for this other than we are
only (16) quarters into this process,'' Baylor first-year coach
Kevin Steele said. ``Looking through the small window, people might
think we are never going to get it done. We will get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   The margin of defeat was the third-largest for Baylor, and the
worst in 86 years. LSU topped the Bears 89-0 in 1908 and the
Longhorns scorched them 89-0 in 1913. Saturday also was the first
time Texas has shut out an opponent since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing we asked (our defense) to do was dominate the
ballgame, and we felt like the game would be dominated in the
running game for us and in stopping the running game for them,''
Texas coach Mack Brown said. ``If we stopped their running game,
they would become one-dimensional, and we knew they like to be
balanced offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor (0-4, 0-2 Big 12) gained only 12 yards on 20 carries,
while Texas (4-1, 1-0) picked up 233 yards on the ground. Backup
quarterback Odell James led the Bears with a less-then-grand
rushing total of 14 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But the running game was only part of the dominance for the
Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Total yards: 586-159. First downs: 34-8. Passing yards 353-147.
And most importantly, touchdowns: 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   Texas quarterback Major Applewhite was superb, completing 26 of
37 passes for 333 yards and three touchdowns, and Hodges Mitchell
came through with his second consecutive 100-yard rushing game,
picking up 131 yards on 22 carries with a pair of first-half
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite and backup Chris Simms, who saw action in the fourth
quarter (3-of-4 for 20 yards and one touchdown), stood unmolested
in the pocket and picked the Bears apart. Baylor did not have a
sack, and Brown said it was the first time he had ever seen a game
where the quarterbacks for one team never hit the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was maybe one or two times where a throw was hurried,
but for the most part, maybe 99.9 percent of the time, they weren't
even close,'' Applewhite said. ``They have some good defensive
backs, but our offensive line protected really well. I just think
that they really got discouraged early in the game, Baylor did. We
kind of took their will (to win) away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns took it away with a masterful first half.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite completed 17 of 23 pass attempts for 231 yards and
Mitchell rushed for 99 yards on 14 carries as Texas raced to a 42-0
lead at the intermission.
</P>
<P>
   At the half, Texas had 348 yards of total offense and 18 first
downs, compared to Baylor's 127 yards and six first downs. And the
Baylor numbers were inflated by four plays of 19 or more yards that
didn't amount to anything as far as a threat to the Texas defense.
</P>
<P>
   The second half was just as impressive as the Longhorns held
Baylor to 32 totals yards and two first downs.
</P>
<P>
   After opening a 14-0 lead after the first quarter, the Longhorns
tallied 28 second-quarter points and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   A Chris Robertson dive into the end zone capped an 11-play,
53-yard march on UT's first possession for the game's first points.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the opening quarter, Texas went 80 yards in eight
plays, taking just 3:01 to do it, with Mitchell ending the drive by
following fullback Ricky Brown off the right side for a three-yard
touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play of the second quarter, UT linebacker De'Andre
Lewis picked off a pass from backup quarterback James to set Texas
up at the Baylor 13.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell wasted no time finding the end zone, juking Tommie
Black and running over Rodney Smith for the Longhorns' third
touchdown of the game. Kris Stockton added the extra point for a
21-0 Texas lead.
</P>
<P>
   James connected with Darrell Bush on a 29-yard screen play for
the Bears' first first down of the game more than 16 minutes into
the contest.
</P>
<P>
   However, the drive stalled after a costly holding penalty,
setting up a punting situation on fourth-and-13 from the Bears' 45.
Baylor chose to try a fake punt, but punter Kyle Atteberry's pass
was picked off by Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns finished the half in style, with their pass
offense continuing to click on all cylinders after Hill's second
interception and a four-yard return gave Texas the ball at its 42
with 1:35 to play in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite hit Kwame Cavil for 13 yards and then found him again
for a 37-yard pickup to the eight. On the next play, the sophomore
quarterback gunned a pass to a sliding Ryan Nunez in the end zone.
The drive took only 48 seconds and gave Texas an insurmountable
42-0 lead.

Rice gets a taste of victory
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEAL FARMER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
It's sort of like getting that ice-cold soda after a long, hot day
_ and the drink is flat. Yes, your thirst is addressed. But you
want more.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way the Rice offense was for a large part of
Saturday's game _ bland enough to do the job but hardly satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls suffered a turnover, tossed an illegal forward pass,
were stopped twice inside the 20, and committed numerous mistakes.
But they finally put together a long drive in fourth-quarter crunch
time to set up a 31-yard Derek Crabtree field goal that gave them a
20-17 victory over Navy before a crowd of 44,217 at Rice Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Rice outgained Navy, 322 yards to 281, but the multiple miscues
created an uneasy feeling on the offensive side of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were frustrated, because we were moving the ball like crazy
but not getting any points,'' said Rice quarterback Chad
Richardson. ``But I think it shows a lot about this team that we
stuck in there and kept moving the ball. We stopped making the
little mistakes and finally put some points on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Their first victory of the season gave the Owls some much-needed
momentum as they prepare to travel to Tulsa next week for their
Western Athletic Conference opener.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Owls' problem Saturday lay in a number of injuries
on offense. Tackle Rod Beavan (multiple injuries), fullback Jamie
Tyler (series of bruises), and quarterback Jeremy Bates (stress
fracture in foot) all missed the game. Backup quarterback Corey
Evans suffered a twisted knee in the second half and will have an
MRI to determine the scope of his injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corey had gone down the series before (the game-winning
drive), and Chad was cramping, so we decided on the sidelines that
we were just going to do our basic things,'' said Rice guard Neal
Gray. ``We were going to try to save Chad's legs and be a typical
option offense _ go four yards at a time. Before you knew it, we
were down in field-goal range. It gives you a lot of confidence
that in weeks to come we can do that in crunch time.''
</P>
<P>
   Owls coach Ken Hatfield said part of the problem was Navy's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kept us from being as effective as we wanted to be, but
we're not perfect,'' Hatfield said. ``We made some things happen
and earned things the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   With only Richardson available to quarterback in the fourth
quarter, former quarterback Ben Wulf _ who has been working out at
running back _ was taking snaps on the sideline in case he was
needed. Also though Bates had not suited up, he went to the locker
room to dress out and returned with less than four minutes
remaining in the game, ready to be inserted if Richardson were to
go down.
</P>
<P>
   Navy (1-3) marched 80 yards in eight plays on its first
possession _ including a 41-yard run by quarterback Brian
Broadwater off the initial snap _ to take a 7-0 lead. Rice (1-3)
countered with three plays and minus-three yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were worried after our first series,'' Gray said. ``But the
way our team is, we have been through a lot of tough times this
season. We knew it was important to overcome it and keep working
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Things looked better on Rice's next possession when the Owls
took a punt from their 46 and drove to the Navy six. However, a
pitch from Richardson to halfback Leroy Bradley fell off of
Bradley's shoulder pads and was recovered at the seven by Navy's
Ryan Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   On its next possession, Rice drove again, this time from the
Navy 44 to the Middies' 12, before the offense broke down. On
fourth-and-one, Richardson was stopped by Chris Lepore for a
two-yard loss, and the Midshipmen took over at their 14.
</P>
<P>
   Two possessions later, Navy used another big play to take a 14-0
lead. On first down at his 21, Navy fullback Raheem Lambert took
the ball up the middle, broke two tackles and sprinted 79 yards to
silence the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But the Owls came right back, covering 80 yards in seven plays
to draw within 14-7. Evans scored on a five-yard run on
third-and-goal.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Rice defense flexed it muscle, holding the Middies on
three straight plays to set up fourth-and-10 at the Navy 12. After
a punt, Rice set up shop at the Navy 47 with 1:58 left on the
first-half clock and drove all the way in only five plays. The
game-tying score came on a 15-yard pass from Richardson to receiver
Raphael Tillman on the right side of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Midshipmen refused to bend, however. They took their first
possession of the second half and drove from midfield to the Rice
32. Tim Shubzda then booted a 49-yard field goal _ matching the
third-longest in school history _ to give the Middies a 17-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls then found their stride on offense and did what they do
best _ devouring the clock with a 15-play drive. Rice started from
its 20 and got to the Navy 24. On third down, Richardson overthrew
a wide-open Tillman at the goal line, and the Owls had to settle
for a game-tying 41-yard field goal by Crabtree.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams struggled to get anything going offensively until
Rice had another time-eating drive late in the contest. After 16
plays and 7:59, the Owls couldn't advance past the Navy 14.
Crabtree kicked a 31-yard field goal with 2:27 remaining, sending
the Rice players into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   A key play came when Richardson appeared to be stopped on
third-and-two at the Navy 18. He jumped the line and dived for a
first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a critical play and was a tough game,'' Hatfield
said. ``No one on either side was giving up.''

Texas A&AMP;M defense carries day
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
COLLEGE STATION _ All those accolades for the Texas A&AMP;M offense?
Better put them on hold for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies' offense scored no touchdowns against Southern
Mississippi on Saturday afternoon at Kyle Field and had only one
drive that went farther than 35 yards. Quarterback Randy McCown was
12-of-29 for 134 yards, while running back Dante' Hall managed 23
yards on 16 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The best offense was the Wrecking Crew defense, which
intercepted four passes and returned two for touchdowns in a 23-6
win. Kicker Terence Kitchens added three field goals, including a
62-yarder at the end of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game, we want to get our turnovers,'' said cornerback
Jay Brooks, who returned an interception 41 yards midway in the
third quarter for the Aggies' first touchdown of the game. ``We
want picks (interceptions), and we want to score on defense. The
guys up front put a lot of pressure on their quarterbacks, and the
defensive backs played together.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kitchens hit three field goals in the first half, Brooks
and Michael Jameson both returned interceptions for touchdowns in
the second half. The Aggies held Southern Mississippi to 129 total
yards (111 passing, 18 rushing) and had six sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was vintage Wrecking Crew today,'' said Aggies coach R.C.
Slocum. ``It was fun to watch. We knew they had an outstanding
defense, and it was going to be a challenge moving the ball. To
have a chance to win the game, our defense was going to have play
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense went way beyond that. Because of it, the Aggies won
a game in which the offense did not score a touchdown for the first
time since 1985, when they had four field goals and an interception
return for a touchdown in a 19-7 win over Houston. The last time an
Aggies offense did not score a touchdown in a game was in a 16-6
loss (two field goals) to Texas in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing you can say about this game was that we got a
win,'' said Hall. ``The (offensive) numbers are ugly, but the win
was pretty. That was a great defense we played, but our defense was
the story today. But our defense is the story every week.''
</P>
<P>
   And how. In three games, the Aggies have allowed 68 rushing
yards on 75 carries. Overall, they have given up 691 yards of total
offense. The Golden Eagles' only touchdown of the game came on a
54-yard pass from backup quarterback Cable Davis to Todd Pinkston
early in the fourth quarter. Take that away, and the Aggies held
Southern Miss to 75 yards of total offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play particularly well on offense,'' said Southern
Miss coach Jeff Bower in the understatement of the day. ``We
couldn't move the ball, and we never got into a rhythm. That's a
really good defensive team if you're not doing things well on
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for the Aggies. On the opening drive of
the game, it looked as if they were going to go three-and-out. But
punter Shane Lechler dropped the snap, picked the ball up and raced
22 yards to the Texas A&AMP;M 46 for the first down.
</P>
<P>
   On their best drive of the day, the Aggies moved to the Southern
Miss four-yard line behind 3-of-3 passing by McCown for 25 yards
and 15 rushing yards by the quarterback. The drive stalled, and
Kitchens kicked a 20-yard field goal to make it 3-0 with 8:05 left
in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies' defense allowed a total of three yards on eight
plays in the first quarter, setting the tone for what kind of day
it was going to be for the Golden Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second quarter, a short punt set up the Aggies at
the Southern Miss 46. McCown hit Bethel Johnson for 21 yards on
first down. Later in the drive, McCown ran for 10 yards, but things
stalled at the 11-yard line. Kitchens nailed a 28-yard field goal
to make it 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   With time running down in the first half, an interception by
Jason Webster gave the Aggies the ball at their 36 with only 33
seconds left. McCown hit Chris Cole for 22 yards, and a pass
interference call on Southern Miss put the ball at the 27, in good
field-goal range for Kitchens with 14 seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   But the Aggies were called for holding on the next play, pushing
it back to the 44-yard line. Kitchens, a walk-on who was told he
had been awarded a scholarship by Slocum two days before Saturday's
game, banged a low line-drive kick through from 62 yards to make it
9-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come over to Kyle Field every day and kick about 75 to 100
field goals,'' said Kitchens. ``But the longest I think I'd ever
tried was 60 or 61 yards. It was the end of the half, so there was
nothing to lose. I just tried to hit it good but not overkick it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies continued their defensive domination in the third
quarter. After two series of going nowhere, USM starting
quarterback Jeff Kelly was replaced by Davis. The second pass Davis
tried was picked off by Brooks, who returned it 41 yards to make it
16-0 with 7:20 left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't improve for Davis, who was intercepted three times
and sacked three times. His lone bright spot was finding Pinkston
for the touchdown to make it 16-6. The Golden Eagles went for two
points and didn't convert.
</P>
<P>
   The next time the Eagles got the ball, Sedrick Curry intercepted
a pass by Davis. In the series after that one, Jameson intercepted
a pass and went 26 yards into the end zone to make it 23-6 with
8:32 left in the game. Davis was 2-of-12 with three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to put pressure on their quarterbacks to force them
into mistakes,'' said Aggies linebacker Jason Glenn. ``We're never
satisfied with just good defense. We want great defense. We want it
like the old Wrecking Crews that were dominant.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's brother, Aaron, was a cornerback on the 1992 and '93 A&AMP;M
teams that won Southwest Conference championships and held teams to
10 points or fewer in 13 of the 25 games they played. Is this
year's Wrecking Crew starting to measure up to those teams?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we're getting there,'' said Glenn. ``With more work
and more practice, I think we can live up to that tradition.''

RANGERS PASSED A's TEST; SO, LET THE PARTY BEGIN 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Reared on caution and the bitter milk of
Septembers past, Rangers fans had every reason to look to the
eastern sky last night.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd had come for a party. But the inky,
threatening clouds just beyond The Ballpark walls threatened to
postpone it all.
</P>
<P>
   An omen?
</P>
<P>
   Not this year. Not this season.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's quick 3-0 lead vanished _ like the threatening rain _
in one, eight-run blink.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, it seems, stops the party this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most interesting and exciting thing to me has been the way
we've played these last two nights,'' manager Johnny Oates said
after the Rangers' 10-4 victory had chiseled their magic number to
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the way the guys have responded. The way the pitchers
have pitched. The way the hitters have hit. And the fans have been
_ that's the way it's supposed to be going into October.''
</P>
<P>
   The test, in other words, is over. The Rangers have passed.
</P>
<P>
   They've passed the Oakland test. They've passed the TAAS test.
They've passed the SAT. They've passed the litmus test, the
Rorschach test, the crash test, the breath test and the stress
test.
</P>
<P>
   In what was supposed to be their ultimate test of the season,
against the precocious, onrushing Athletics, the Rangers have been
the ones with all the A's.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for a party.
</P>
<P>
   As Rangers fans know, both of the club's two previous division
titles have been clinched on the out-of-town scoreboard, not on the
field. The Rangers have yet to wrap up the American League West
with a victory, on their home field, in front of their home fans.
</P>
<P>
   That could all change today. The Rangers will have 15 cases of
something bubbly and chilled, waiting to celebrate a division title
that some thought was slipping from their grasps.
</P>
<P>
   But they've passed the test.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they did one year ago, when they went out to Anaheim and
laid waste to the Angels' hopes, the Rangers have done the same to
the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Before last night's game, Oates said he had been joking with
Oakland manager Art Howe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Art, `I like you guys, but would you please go away?'
'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics didn't have to. Rather, just as they did Friday
night, the Rangers exploded past the A's in one furious,
single-inning haze. John Burkett simply took it from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an answer for you,'' Oates admitted. ``But we've
done it four times in the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come out of Detroit and it looks like we have our backs to
the wall, and \REsteban\S Loaiza beats Cleveland. Then we go into
Kansas City and we look terrible _ just terrible. It looked like we
weren't even having fun. Rusty \RGreer\S and Luis \RAlicea\S get
hurt, and we looked like we were down again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we come back. The same scenario four times. Why? I don't
know. I'm just glad they do.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, this is a veteran-laden team that, while some Rangers
fans were wincing and worrying, has become a consistent winner _
and, soon, a division winner for the third time in four years.
</P>
<P>
   They have avoided the long, telling droughts that used to define
seasons past. The heroes have come from a multitude of directions.
It was Burkett again last night, along with, among others, third
baseman Todd Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a young ballclub,'' Oates said. ``Because of the
veterans we have, I think it's easier to stay away from those ups
and downs.''
</P>
<P>
   These Rangers have played with heart. The games like these
against Oakland and against the Indians have shown that vividly.
</P>
<P>
   And the poster kid for the team's heart may be Burkett, who won
again last night when the Rangers needed it most.
</P>
<P>
   When times were tough earlier this season, when Burkett's
earned-run average looked like a long cab fare and he was yanked
from the starting rotation, he handled his demotion with class.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the scourge of this season, John Burkett now may be
one of its best symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his perseverance, the Rangers have a party coming.
</P>
<P>
   This test is done.

MOSLEY HAS WELTERWEIGHT WALLOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMECULA, Calif. _ Meet Shane Mosley. Welterweight.
</P>
<P>
   The former IBF lightweight champion, who abdicated his throne
and moved up two weight classes in search of more fame and fortune,
proved he belongs by doing something no one else has been able to
do: knock out Wilfredo Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   And he did it in a most dramatic way, with two rights and
follow-up left that ended a close, entertaining brawl at 2:38 of
the final round Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   How does Mosley (33-0, with 31 knockouts) compare to the
welterweights he moved up to face one day?
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, who lost to Oscar De La Hoya in eight rounds because of
a bad cut, said Mosley is a legitimate 147-pounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he's any better than Oscar or (Felix)
Trinidad,'' said Rivera (30-4-1, 19 KOs). ``All I know is he's a
harder puncher. He's the only one who was able to stop me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be a great champ.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley had a tough time.
</P>
<P>
   He started quickly, using his superior speed and all-around
ability to control the early rounds. However, Rivera, as tough and
crafty as they come, piled up points in the middle rounds by
holding and leaning and punching as Mosley began to tire.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when it counted most, Mosley took complete charge. He
ended the ninth round with a painful flurry and dominated the 10th,
landing several solid blows before finally putting Rivera down for
the first time in his career. The Puerto Rican was too hurt to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   The judges had Mosley leading 88-83, 86-85 and 86-86 after nine
rounds. The Daily News had it 87-84 Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the De La Hoya fight (against Trinidad), I thought I was
ahead on points,'' said Mosley. ``But I didn't want to leave it in
the hands of the judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lightweights are faster than welterweights, but Rivera takes a
great punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top welterweights are Oscar, Trinidad and Sugar Shane
Mosley. I proved I have welterweight power tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley's move from 135 pounds to 147 raised some eyebrows, even
in light of his ability. Now his ambitions seem to make perfect
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready. I want to fight for a championship in my next
fight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a preliminary bout, South African Lehlohonolo Ledwaba stopped
Edison Valencia of Colombia at 2:31 of the fifth round to retain
his IBF junior featherweight title.

SWC PAYS HEAVY PRICE FOR SCANDALS OF THE 1980S 
WITH THE CENTURY IN SPORTS PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once he took office as commissioner of the Southwest Conference
in November 1982, it wasn't long before Fred Jacoby got an accurate
read on the future of the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't in the office two weeks,'' Jacoby said, ``and I could
tell we had problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby couldn't find an assistant coach in the conference who
had a copy of the NCAA enforcement guidelines. When Jacoby asked
one of his aides if he knew where to find one, the aide went back
to his desk and rummaged through the drawers and uncovered a copy.
</P>
<P>
   SWC assistant coaches not only didn't have a copy of the NCAA
guidelines, it was almost as if boosters of some of the SWC schools
didn't have a care about what the rules were. Slush funds were
created. Personnel within the athletics departments at some schools
were in charge of distributing payments to players in violation of
NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   David Berst, the NCAA director of enforcement whose appearance
on SWC campuses was as popular as a mound of fire ants, remembers
the attitude of some of the school administrators he investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was `Catch me if you can,''' Berst said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, most were caught.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1980s ended, six of the nine SWC schools were placed
on probation for recruiting infractions. Only Arkansas, Baylor and
Rice were untouched. And by the close of the decade, Arkansas was
poised to bolt from the SWC in favor of the Southeastern
Conference. The end of the SWC was on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a building crescendo,'' Jacoby said, ``and I got caught
right in the vortex.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant Teaff, former coach at Baylor, said the recruiting
scandals were a major contributing factor to the league's demise
after the 1995-96 school year. For Teaff, who grew up in West Texas
listening to SWC football on the radio, it was the end of a
life-long passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conference had a storied history,'' Teaff said. ``It was,
in so many people's minds, the premier college football conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the '80s for me was an extremely disappointing time. It
was our tragedy, and it played out nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaff remembers the tension in meeting rooms when SWC coaches
attended special conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just glared at each other,'' Teaff said. ``I looked around
the room and knew what \Rother coaches\S were doing, and they knew
that I knew what they were doing. Previously, I had such respect
and good relationships with other coaches like Darrell Royal \Rat
Texas\S and Frank Broyles \Rat Arkansas\S. But with these coaches,
there was agitation. There were hard feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference where coaches used to pat each other on the back
had become a league where coaches seemingly wanted to stab each
other in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby believes the forces that led to the league's unraveling
began building as far back as the 1950s when practically all SWC
schools were fielding teams capable of winning a conference
championship. But the '60s were dominated by the state schools _
mostly Texas. That continued into the '70s, by which time unrest
built among alums wanting their schools to get back in the title
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people that went to school after World War II were in
their 40s and 50s and making good money when we moved the clock up
to the '80s,'' Jacoby said. ``I know I could go to lunch with a
group of lawyers or other professionals, and one of them went to
law school at Texas, another one to SMU or Baylor or Tech. They'd
needle each other if their alma mater had a bad football team. It
was bragging rights _ very competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, they were tired of losing. I think that's when
the payments started.'' `A payroll to meet' ``Mustang Mania'' was
created in the early 1980s when SMU began to challenge for its
first trip to the Cotton Bowl since 1965, and only its second since
Doak Walker played in 1949. It gave birth to the ``Pony Express''
when Eric Dickerson and Craig James became college football's most
prolific pair of running backs playing on the same team.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, after NCAA probation kept them from advancing to any
bowl games despite a 10-win season in 1981, the Mustangs played in
_ and won _ their Cotton Bowl after the '82 season. There was a
10-2 record in '83, but the true Mania soon started creeping out.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, SMU recruited Muse, Pa., offensive lineman Sean
Stopperich. The NCAA contended Stopperich was given a monthly
salary to attend SMU, and his father _ laid off from a steel mill _
was given an apartment in the Dallas area. Stopperich never played
at SMU because of a knee injury, but the NCAA, in May 1985, handed
SMU a two-year probation that included the loss of 45 scholarships.
It was deemed the most severe penalty in NCAA history.
</P>
<P>
   It also was the second time in the '80s the NCAA visited ``The
Hilltop.'' The NCAA left by imposing sanctions on SMU for major
recruiting violations. Seeing that a school like SMU seemed unfazed
by things like TV and bowl bans and the loss of scholarships, the
NCAA instituted Section 7-(f)-(1) into its enforcement code in June
1985.
</P>
<P>
   That rule stated that any school caught cheating twice within
five years could lose the right to compete for up to two years. It
became known as the ``Death Penalty.'' SMU was one of six schools
that voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it wasn't long before SMU walked into trouble again, due
to a decision made even before the harsh sanctions were handed down
in May 1985.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, SMU officials called a meeting to ban nine
boosters involved in some level of NCAA rules violations. But one
booster, Dallas real estate executive Sherwood Blount, pointed out
something to SMU board of governors chairman Bill Clements. Soon to
be elected to his second term as Texas governor, Clements was about
to make a decision that would put national embarrassment on his
political career. Blount told Clements there were still players on
the SMU roster promised money to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a payroll to meet,'' Blount is quoted as saying in
David Whitford's 1989 book, ``A Payroll to Meet.'' ``Maybe you
should consider a line item to the university budget.''
</P>
<P>
   So, according to Whitford's book, and an investigation conducted
by a group of Methodist bishops, Clements told SMU athletic
director Bob Hitch to keep the cash rolling and honor the previous
financial commitments. Though SMU had fired recruiting coordinator
Bootsie Larsen because he dished out the money in the previous
scandal, Hitch assigned associate AD Henry Lee Parker to collect
the money from boosters and pay it out to those players expecting
the cash.
</P>
<P>
   One of those was David Stanley, a linebacker who wanted to
transfer out of SMU after the probation in 1985. After no teams
would offer him a scholarship, Stanley wanted back in at SMU. Coach
Bobby Collins refused.
</P>
<P>
   So Stanley started talking _ to the NCAA and, maybe more
damaging to SMU, to a Dallas television station. On a Nov. 12, 1986
telecast, Stanley said he had been promised $25,000 to play
football at SMU. An envelope with the initials HLP (Henry Lee
Parker), in which Stanley said he received his monthly cash, also
appeared on the telecast.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA Committee on Infractions applied the ``Death Penalty''
on Feb. 25, 1987. It suspended SMU's football program for the '87
season and limited the school to seven games away from home in '88.
After forcing the resignations of Hitch and Collins, SMU decided
not to play again until 1989. The Mustangs haven't been to a bowl
game since.
</P>
<P>
   The gravity of the moment showed on Berst. Shortly into the news
conference announcing the ``Death Penalty,'' Berst tried to walk
away from the dais. He collapsed and was carried into a side room.
He apparently was suffering from the flu and stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember everything,'' Berst said, ``until my eyes closed.''
Hu$h, it's Jackie While Baylor, SMU and Texas were making all the
trips to the Cotton Bowl in the early '80s, Texas A&AMP;M was suffering
from an inferiority complex. Dallas businessman H.R. ``Bum'' Bright
changed that when it came time to make a decision on the status of
coach Tom Wilson after the 1981 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got five of what, to me, were the big-name coaches at the
time,'' Bright said. ``I got Bud Wilkinson, Bear Bryant and I can't
remember who else, and I told them to give me the names of five
coaches _ 1-2-3-4-5 in their order of preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took all the names and the one mentioned most was Bo
Schembechler \Rof Michigan\S. No. 2 was Bobby Bowden \Rof Florida
State\S. Three was Jackie Sherrill \Rof Pittsburgh\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright talked contract with Schembechler and his wife when they
visited the Bright household in Dallas. Schembechler had previous
history of heart trouble. So when Schembechler said he wanted a
10-year contract _ ``live or die'' _ Bright scratched Schembechler
off the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a delightful man,'' Bright said. ``Just as charming as
he could be. His price was very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Money was an issue with Bowden, whose program at Florida State
was poised for a run at national prominence. Bright said Bowden
told him that FSU had an athletic budget twice the size of A&AMP;M's.
</P>
<P>
   So Bright called Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me `Bum, by God, I told you to hire this boy Jackie
Sherrill,''' Bright said. ``Sherrill was there in the hotel room,
so I talked with Jackie. Jackie was a high-class guy as far as I
was concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   But his aloofness, and his contract, didn't ingratiate him with
other SWC coaches and media. His contract called for a salary of
$260,000 per year _ more than the university president _ and he
didn't have much to show for it when A&AMP;M went 16-16-1 his first
three seasons .
</P>
<P>
   But in '84, A&AMP;M started a five-year winning streak over UT. And
the '85 season produced the first of three consecutive Cotton
Bowls, winning one against Heisman Trophy winner Bo Jackson and
Auburn and another over high-profile Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   But trouble was on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies were placed on NCAA probation in '88, keeping them
from the Cotton Bowl. They were headed back to the Cotton Bowl in
'89 when a mysterious overnight delivery service package containing
money showed up addressed to a former recruit. The speculation ran
wild. Before the game with Texas, students at UT went to work in
the upper deck of Memorial Stadium. Using the flip-back seating
that is visible to anyone driving on Interstate 35 in Austin, they
spelled out a message:
</P>
<P>
   HU$H.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M escaped a serious NCAA probe. But Sherrill resigned to make
way for the promotion of assistant coach R.C. Slocum.
</P>
<P>
   To Bright, hiring Sherrill was the right move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we had to go out and get a good coach, and that's what
we got. I thought everything turned out real well. Nobody did as
good a job at A&AMP;M as Jackie did, unless you go back and look at
Dana Bible.'' SEC's in them thar hills By the end of the decade,
who would want to keep company with the Southwest Conference?
Arkansas, remote in the Ozark Mountains and untouched by the NCAA,
began to pack up the truck and was ready to move to the SEC. The
Southeastern Conference, that is. Full stadiums, nice TV contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The recruiting scandals weren't the last straw that got Arkansas
looking outside the SWC.
</P>
<P>
   ``That period of time contributed not to us moving, but it
contributed to there being less confidence in our programs by the
fans,'' Arkansas athletic director and former football coach Frank
Broyles said. ``We were damaged by this to a degree. We couldn't
sell our TV package for what we thought it was worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Like in all sports, TV was becoming the major revenue stream for
college athletics. With slow growth on the tube for the SWC,
Broyles looked at the other revenue producer. But the live gate at
league stadiums had fallen off, particularly among the smaller
schools.
</P>
<P>
   While the Razorbacks are just about the only major sporting
interest in Arkansas, the same wasn't the case in Texas. Broyles
counted it up. By the '80s, there were three major-league teams in
the Fort Worth-Dallas area (the Cowboys, the Rangers and the
Mavericks), three more in Houston (the Oilers, the Astros and the
Rockets) and another in San Antonio (the Spurs).
</P>
<P>
   There were days in the '50s when Arkansas and A&AMP;M would move
their game to Houston and play in front of 70,000 people at Rice
Stadium. But in the '80s, Rice Stadium looked like an empty seat
factory on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the SEC was filling stadiums and getting big TV
contracts like another southern phenomenon _ NASCAR. Broyles was
ready to put the pedal to the medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pie was split many, many times by the pros coming into
Texas,'' Broyles said. ``The newspapers had more to write about.
The discretionary dollar was scaled over to other venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1988, after seriously considering what Arkansas' future
could be in the Southwest Conference and hearing what was available
in the SEC, I asked \Rthe SEC\S if we could join.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, it happened. The SWC wouldn't last much
longer.

JAPANESE-AMERICAN FAMILY TO GET LETTERMAN'S JACKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DENNIS McCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The kid was as tough as they come, his teammates
remember - took his hits on the line of scrimmage from guys much
bigger and never quit.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, Larry Kobayashi was a gamer all right. A real scrapper at
right guard on the second string at Manual Arts High as a sophomore
in 1940 and a junior in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   He would have been a starter on the 1942 varsity in his senior
year, they all agree. A lock, the coaches said.
</P>
<P>
   But no one saw Dec. 7, 1941, coming.
</P>
<P>
   When football practice began in '42, Larry Kobayashi,
Japanese-American, was nowhere around. He, his parents and three
sisters were living in a small town called Northe Cache on the
Utah-Idaho border by then.
</P>
<P>
   They had been given two choices by our government when war broke
out with Japan - move inland, away from the Western Defense Zone,
or be relocated to a camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a distant cousin who arranged housing for us, so we
packed up and went,'' Kobayashi, 73, said last week from his
Camarillo home. ``My dad had to close his grocery store and become
a field worker to support us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left Manual Arts with a heavy heart. I only had a semester
and a half to go before graduating.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be almost four years before the Kobayashis were allowed
to come home to Southern California. By that time, Larry was just
finishing up a stint in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   The government that didn't trust him in 1942 drafted him in
1943.
</P>
<P>
   Larry taught Japanese to Army officers in the Counter
Intelligence Corps in Baltimore, Md. After being discharged, he
came home to enter the school of pharmacy at the University of
Southern California, graduating in 1951 and opening his own
pharmacy, which he ran until retiring in 1985, and moving to
Camarillo with his wife, Yukimi.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where he was last month when the phone rang and the
voice on the other end of the line asked, ``Is this the Larry
Kobayashi who played football at Manual Arts High in 1941?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, everyone on the team knew it wasn't right, Ralph Ahn
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the authorities were telling us it was right, so we were
confused,'' said Ahn, a Korean-American and one of Kobayashi's
closest teammates on the Manual Arts football team in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we knew was that the '42 season was starting and Larry
wasn't going to be with us, only because he was Japanese,'' said
Ahn, 72. ``Heck, I was Korean. I thought I was next.''
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't next. Ahn graduated from Manual Arts, joined the
service and later became a football coach. From 1964 to 1969, he
was head coach at Alemany High School before devoting himself full
time to the family business, the Moongate Restaurant in suburban
Panorama City.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kobayashi, Ahn had moved on with life. But unlike his old
pal, he had also kept an eye on the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once or twice a year, I'd get together socially with the guys,
mostly the football players, and Larry's name would come up,'' Ahn
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never got his varsity letter, and he deserved it. Larry was
as much a part of that team as anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be great, the guys agreed, if they could find him
now, almost 60 years later, and give him that football letter?
</P>
<P>
   ``But nobody knew where he was,'' Ahn said. ``Then I got lucky
and ran into someone at the Japanese-American Community Center in
Arleta who knew his sister. That's how we finally got a hold of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   So come Oct. 7, at the 5th annual Manual Arts Athletes of the
Ages reunion, one of the guests of honor will be the second-string
right guard who never got the chance to be a starter because he was
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   The captain of this year's football team, along with school
principal Wendell Greer, will present Kobayashi with a special
letterman's jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor, but I don't think I earned it,'' Larry said
Friday, offering no hint of bitterness at what happened to his
family 57 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never looked back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahn said his old pal was wrong, that he certainly did earn that
letterman's jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sure could have used you in '42 because we weren't a very
good team that year,'' Ahn said Friday, seeing his old friend for
the first time in 57 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kobayashi smiled but didn't have the heart to tell him the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   He had a great football year in 1942. He made the varsity and
started at right guard for tiny Northe Cache High School, which
went all the way to the Utah state championship.

UNITED BEATS GALAXY

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Knowing that Colorado blew a chance to take
the Western Conference lead earlier in the day _ and with D.C.
United practically taking the night off _ the Los Angeles Galaxy
did nothing to take advantage of these generous gifts.
</P>
<P>
   United, resting the bulk of its starters for bigger matches next
week, extended its winning streak to 11 with a 2-0 victory over the
Galaxy in front of 29,161 Saturday at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Wood and Clint Peay scored for United, handing Los Angeles
its second straight loss during a crucial stretch of matches with
the Western Conference title and playoff positioning yet to be
decided.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy (18-11, 48 points) lead over Colorado (19-9, 47
points) was trimmed to one heading into Wednesday's meeting between
the two clubs at the Rose Bowl. And within striking distance are
Dallas (17-13, 45 points) and Chicago (16-33, 44 points).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not our best game that's for sure,'' said Galaxy coach
Sigi Schmid. ``It's been a while since we lost two straight. We
lost a little of the momentum we have been building up. But if it's
going to happen, it's better that it happens now than in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Eastern Conference regular season title in the bank,
United rested seven of its starters to prepare for next week's
CONCACAF Champions Cup in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Striker Roy Lassister and defender Jeff Agoos came on in the
second half to bolster United's lineup, but the league's best squad
had the look of a reserve team. United is hoping to defend the
CONCACAF title it won last year by beating CD Toluca of Mexico to
become the first U.S. club to win the lA5A% &QC; nship.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-team competition for North and Central America as well
as the Caribbean region has added significance this season. The
winner will earn a berth to January's first-ever FIFA World club
championship to be held in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid says facing a depleted cast is sometimes just as tough as
facing the starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the guys are out there that you know, they are a lot more
predictable,'' said Schmid. ``These guys that they played out there
tonight are confident because this is there chance to make a mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Lassister came in he played 45 minutes and he was no
problem for us. But A.J. Wood and Albright up front were a much
bigger problem for us because of their size. I mean, it really
didn't matter who they put on the field, they were just better than
us tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing concern for Los Angeles is the play of Mexican striker
Carlos Hermosillo. He has gone scoreless in his last four games
after returning from back stiffness. And he's rarely getting
chances in front of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he had chances against Colorado (last week), but he
didn't have many tonight,'' said Schmid. ``Sometimes he drops to
deep. I also didn't think he had a good game, but I don't think we
provided enough service for him from the midfield.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the depleted cast didn't seem to bother United at
all.

STANFORD BEATS UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD _ The Bruins attributed this loss to three plays, but
what really beat them was one down _ third down.
</P>
<P>
   If it looked familiar, it was. UCLA's defense was as porous
Saturday against Stanford as it was last season against Miami and
Wisconsin. Ineptitude simply wore a different face; 10 months ago,
the Bruins couldn't stop the run. Saturday, they couldn't stop the
pass, especially on third down.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a 42-32 loss before 47,432 at Stanford Stadium
that gave the Cardinal (3-1, 3-0) early-season control of the Rose
Bowl race and put the Bruins (2-2, 0-1) in a familiar position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to treat it like the (season-opening loss to)
Washington State (in 1997), when we came back to win every game
after that,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``There were some good
things to build on (Saturday), and obviously some things to work
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford gained 672 total yards _ just 17 fewer than Miami _ but
that's just the beginning of UCLA's ignominy.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal passed for 465 yards (a record for UCLA opponents)
and averaged an astounding 17 yards per pass attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve quarterback Joe Borchard, of Camarillo, inflicted most
of the damage. He replaced injured starter Todd Husak in the second
quarter and passed for five touchdowns. He also ran for a team-high
74 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford receiver Troy Walters caught nine passes for 278 yards
_ including a Pacific-10-record, 98-yard touchdown catch early in
the third quarter. His yardage total is the third-highest in Pac-10
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going to attack them,'' Walters said. ``Our
game plan is to attack no matter who is out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing hurt the Bruins more than their ``third-down
defense.'' In the first half, Stanford had six third-down attempts
and needed an average of 8.3 yards to convert. It completed all six
chances and averaged 11 yards in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of the game was their big plays and third downs,''
Bruins defensive tackle Pete Holland said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (2-2, 0-1) actually did a few things right. They
contained Stanford's running game, and they moved the ball
effectively in the second half. They pressured the Cardinal
quarterbacks and got a special-teams touchdown (Lovell Houston's
95-yard kickoff return).
</P>
<P>
   They ran the ball effectively. They did not commit a turnover,
and they showed impressive resiliency for a young team _ 40 of the
60 players were freshmen or sophomores _ by rallying from a 28-3
third-quarter deficit to close within 35-32 late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins could not overcome three obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   First, quarterback Drew Bennett did not execute the downfield
passing game to Toledo's satisfaction. (All-American receiver Danny
Farmer didn't catch a pass, and receiver Freddie Mitchell had no
catches in the second half.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Bennett needs to get rid of the ball a little quicker,''
Toledo said. ``We missed balls when guys are open that we need to
complete.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Bruins scored just three points in the first
half despite four possessions in Stanford territory. Meanwhile, the
Cardinal executed like UCLA's offense of recent years and built a
21-3 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Second, UCLA's defense looked dazed and confused on third down,
especially on Stanford's final possession of the first half. The
Cardinal converted four successive third-down plays and scored with
50 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Bruins could not overcome Stanford's three big
plays in the second half: Walters' 98-yard touchdown catch, which
gave Stanford a 28-3 lead; a 32-yard fourth-down run by Stanford
punter Sean Tolpinrud that kept a touchdown drive alive; and
Borchard's 56-yard run on third down, which set up the clinching
touchdown late in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran out of gas at the end,'' Borchard said. ``I needed a
break.''
</P>
<P>
   So did UCLA's defense.

NORTHRIDGE FALLS TO EASTERN WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ They couldn't be stopped. They couldn't stop
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the way the 1999 season will unfold for the Cal State
Northridge football team? Great offense, terrible defense?
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Washington ran all over the mistake-prone Matadors and
beat CSUN 48-41 in a Big Sky Conference game Saturday night in
front of 3,556 chilled fans at Woodward Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore quarterback Marcus Brady completed 36 of 49 passes for
484 yards and five touchdowns, but it wasn't enough. CSUN lost four
fumbles and the Eagles had not one but two running backs rush for
more than 200 yards.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a misprint. Jovan Griffith had 262 yards and a
school-record six touchdowns, and his backup, Jesse Chatman, had
211 despite missing a large chunk of the game with a twisted ankle
suffered on the last play of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stopping the run is a concern,'' CSUN interim head coach Jeff
Kearin said. ``We didn't get it done. We've got to look at what
we're doing on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles (2-2, 1-1) had 456 yards rushing, breaking a
19-year-old school record. Amazingly, CSUN (1-2, 0-1) was still in
the game in the final minute. Brady completed a 26-yard touchdown
pass to Ryan Beckwith with 50 seconds left to make it 48-40. Derek
Brown's extra point cut the lead to a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN tried an onsides kick, which was bobbled for a moment by an
Eagles player but recovered by EWU's Chatman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have four turnovers in a game, you shouldn't
expect to win,'' said Brady, who was also sacked four times.
``We've got to cut down on the turnovers and the mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN was already without one emotional leader before the game
started. Jaumal Bradley, the Matadors' leading rusher and a senior
co-captain, suited but couldn't play because of tonsillitis.
Without Bradley, the Matadors had 73 rushing yards and, more
important, couldn't sustain drives long enough to keep the defense
rested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaumal brings a certain something to the offense,'' Kearin
said. ``That's tough, the emotional loss of him not being on the
field. Everybody felt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two players scored in a first half that featured a combined
56 points and 606 yards of offense _ Griffith and CSUN wide
receiver Terrence Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith's first-half line _ 19 carries for 179 yards and five
touchdowns _ was typical of how bad the Matadors were blown off the
ball in the game's first 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith, a sophomore from Lompoc and one of only three Eastern
Washington players from California, tied the school's single-game
record for rushing touchdowns in less than a half. His touchdowns
covered 4, 1, 44, 36, 1 and 8 yards.``(Eastern Washington) was
getting it done,'' said CSUN linebacker Cos Abercrombie, who had a
season-high 11 tackles. ``The big play killed us.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN stayed close in the first half thanks to Jones, a senior
transfer from Fresno State who had two touchdown catches, from 59
and 47 yards, and an 86-yard kickoff return to open the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' first touchdown _ on the opening kickoff _ gave the
Matadors a 6-0 lead with the game only 17 seconds old. Jones gave
CSUN its first kickoff return for a touchdown in eight years. As a
receiver, he finished with six catches for 138 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Brady completed passes to nine different receivers. Aaron Arnold
had a team-leading 10 for 130 yards; Arnold broke the school career
record for receiving yards on a 33-yard reception that set up a
touchdown in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Anrold wasn't about to let the defense take the fall for the
loss, even though the Matadors had 557 yards of total offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put (the defense) in a bad spot sometimes,'' he said. ``We
left them in some bad positions.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither Arnold's record, or Brady's 73 percent completion
rate, or Jones' three touchdowns, could overcome Eastern
Washington's rushing attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you see a team running all over like that... this is
depressing,'' Abercrombie said.

CARDINAL MAKES A MESS OF BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ They callously exploited the handicapped. The
nerve of the Stanford players _ especially their vertically
challenged receiver Troy Walters _ taking advantage of a gimpy UCLA
team like that. And in front of 47,432 witnesses, no less.
Shouldn't somebody have told the Cardinal players they have no
business being parked in the choicest spot in the Pacific-10
standings?
</P>
<P>
   Walters and backup quarterback Joe Borchard were the worst. They
were so heartless, the Stanford band's halftime show could have
been about them.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the band scurried onto the field, formed the outline
of a wheelchair and wailed away, the team many pundits picked to
finish last in the Pacific-10 had, on the strength of its aerial
attack, built an 18-point lead on the reigning conference
champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were banged up on offense and dazed on defense but
the white towel UCLA athletic official Ed Kezirian was waving
wildly on the sidelines in the second half didn't signify
surrender. The Bruins, deficiencies and all, determinedly soldiered
on and whittled the Cardinal's lead to three midway through the
fourth quarter before succumbing, 42-32.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA won the second half but lost the war. For the Bruins, a
slew of moral victories could be as good as it gets this season
unless they get back all of their heavy artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bennett, in the first half of his first start since Cory
Paus was sidelined with sore ribs, consistently released his passes
a split-second late. That afforded the Stanford defenders just
enough time to get a hand on the football or find the step they had
lost on a receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Try as he might, Bennett couldn't lay the football in Danny
Farmer's hands. The superlative senior receiver finished without a
catch. Freddie Mitchell, the Bruins' bookend playmaker, had no
receptions in the second half, this after catching nine passes the
previous week against Fresno State. ``We missed some balls we've
got to complete,'' was how head coach Bob Toledo diplomatically put
it.
</P>
<P>
   For the UCLA players on the sideline who could bear to watch,
Borchard provided a primer. Like Bennett, Borchard was thrust into
action when the Cardinal's starter, Todd Husak, was lost to bruised
ribs on the third offensive series.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike UCLA, the Cardinal had the depth and seasoning to not
just survive the loss, but thrive. Borchard, who grew up in
Camarillo, completed seven of his first eight passes, two of them
for touchdowns. He finished with 324 passing yards and five
touchdowns and boasted the longest run from scrimmage by either
team (56 yards).
</P>
<P>
   As the game dragged on the UCLA fans who made the 400-mile trip
must have felt like they had taken a wrong turn and ended up in
Miami; the Cardinal's 672 yards of total offense were just 17 fewer
yards than the Hurricanes racked up against the Bruins last
December.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to entertaining the home crowd, Borchard did
everything but push the Cardinal's tree mascot around in his
wheelchair (that was left for somebody else).
</P>
<P>
   So many of Borchard's bullets hit Walters in full stride it's a
small wonder the 5-foot-8 flanker didn't cross the end zone more
than three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their pass offense is legit. I was just kind of in shock
watching it,'' said UCLA running back DeShaun Foster, who outran
his counterpart Kerry Carter (100 net yards to 31) despite being
hobbled by a right knee sprain he said is 65 percent healed.
</P>
<P>
   It's true; Borchard and Walters were the next best thing to
Barnum and Bailey. Make no mistake: The Bruins' callow cornerbacks
_ freshmen Joe Hunter and Ricky Manning Jr. _ were the ones
operating without a net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught myself watching them sometimes,'' said Farmer of
Borchard and Walters, who burned UCLA's secondary for the longest
touchdown completion in conference history (98 yards) in the third
minute of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In the 14 seconds it took the Cardinal to increase its lead to
28-3, a lot of Bruins saw their 1999 season flash before their
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-seven of the 60 UCLA players who made the trip were
freshmen, sophomores or walk-ons. Included in that mix was Lovell
Houston, who had the unenviable task of making his college debut
immediately after Walters' electrifying score.
</P>
<P>
   It was sort of like following Bruce Springsteen on stage after
the Boss has brought down the house. Houston, though, clearly
wasn't cowed; he looked like he was born to run when he carried the
ensuing kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first play of the rest of UCLA's season. It has to
be, if the Bruins have designs on defending their title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have folded at 28 to 3,'' said senior fullback Durell
Price. ``Against a team with big-play guys like that, it would have
been easy to go into the tank. We came up short but we had Stanford
biting its nails all the way down to the two-minute warning.''
</P>
<P>
   With senior cornerback Jason Bell felled by injury, Hunter was
the hunted and Manning, manhandled. Afterward they looked like
shell-shocked survivors of some natural disaster. They couldn't
hide from Borchard and, to their credit, didn't hide from the
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real learning experience,'' Hunter said with a sigh.
``I've got to adjust to the ball better. I feel I was in position
to make some big plays but I didn't turn and look for the ball. I
was just playing the hands, the receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Football players are like elephants; they never forget losses.
If not for a goal-line fumble, the Cardinal would have ended the
Bruins' conference winning streak at 12 last October. Motivated by
that memory, they snapped it Saturday at 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know how good it feels,'' senior cornerback Frank
Primus chanted as he skipped into the victorious locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Primus knew what the Bruins have just learned, that to really
feel the pleasure you first have to experience the pain.

PADRES BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It can be interesting to debate what it means to
pitch well in meaningless September games. It's better than getting
pounded, but just what does it prove about what a pitcher can do in
a meaningful situation? That's what the Los Angeles Dodgers'
decision makers must decide during the offseason when they
contemplate whether to move one of their experienced starters.
</P>
<P>
   When evaluating Eric Gagne, they have four starts to go on.
Three of those, including the Dodgers' 3-2 loss to the San Diego
Padres at Dodger Stadium on Saturday, are impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne yielded two hits and one run in seven innings, but in
typical fashion, he didn't figure in the decision though he left
with a lead. The first two batters reliever Matt Herges (0-2) faced
hit homers. Gagne lost a chance for the win when Wally Joyner's fly
to the right-field wall bounced off Raul Mondesi's glove and over
the fence. Wiki Gonzalez then homered to left to give the Padres a
3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a month of looking for anything to help the future,
Gagne might be what the Dodgers want. The 23-year-old rookie
right-hander has allowed five hits in his last 12 innings and has
25 strikeouts in 24 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like him, I like his style,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said. ``He goes at you. The only thing that worries me is his
glasses keep fogging up. Maybe we'll send him to one of those scuba
stores to get that stuff to put on them so they don't fog up
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with the way Gagne's pitching, why change anything?
The French-Canadian struck out seven, one short of the eight
Florida Marlins he fanned in his debut.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne walked one and didn't allow a base runner until Phil Nevin
led off the fifth inning with a single to right. An inning later
Ruben Rivera smashed Gagne's first pitch deep into the left-center
field bleachers to cut the Dodgers' lead to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm giving up too many homers,'' said Gagne, who's allowed
three homers. ``I need to keep the ball down a little more. I need
to work on all of my stuff. My offspeed, my curveball. I have to
throw it for more strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Dodgers like Gagne's ability to throw strikes with
his fastball or offspeed pitches, but they are equally enamored
with his go-get-`em attitude and his willingness to challenge
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   In Gagne's only loss, the Mets scored five runs in six innings.
But after a two-run homer in the first inning, Gagne retired 17 of
19. In his other three starts, Gagne has allowed two earned runs
and seven hits in 18 innings. To show for it, Gagne's 0-1 with a
2.63 ERA.

TROJANS LIKE THE NIGHT LIFE, FOR SMALL FEE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ There may not be much benefit to playing a night
game in Autzen Stadium, especially for USC, unless you consider the
financial reward.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans netted an additional $260,000 by having the game
switched to 7:15 p.m. and televised on Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the players don't really care about the late start,
even though they didn't get back to Los Angeles until 2:30 a.m.
this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys love late games because they get to sleep in,'' USC
coach Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   But one drawback is the that Duck fans seem even louder in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quackers that the fans have always affect you,'' USC free
safety David Gibson said. ``I just know that stadium is a tough
place to play''
</P>
<P>
   Tough turf: USC is easily a faster team on artificial surface,
but don't count tailback Chad Morton as a fan of the OmniTurf that
Oregon has used for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK. I don't particularly like it,'' Morton said. ``I wish
we playing them down (in Los Angeles).''
</P>
<P>
   Radio switch: The night game forced some shuffling in USC's
radio broadcast booth. Play-by-play broadcaster Lee Hamilton was
scheduled to leave the game at halftime, then fly from Eugene to
Portland to Chicago and finally Pittsburgh in to announce today's
NFL game between the Seattle Seahawks and Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Former USC defensive lineman Tim Ryan, normally a sideline
reporter, took over play-by-play duties while Paul McDonald
continued as color commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Same plane: USC's chartered plane to Eugene returned to Los
Angeles on and took UCLA to the Bay Area for its game at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   That might explain how some stickers ended up on the seat trays
for the second flight that had handicapped parking logos with the
letters UCLA at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Droughns' luck: Oregon tailback Reuben Droughns injured his ribs
in the first quarter and was not expected to return. He missed last
year's game against USC after he broke his leg the week before.
</P>
<P>
   A night of firsts: USC tight end Pat Swanson caught the first
pass of his career, a 32-yard reception in the first quarter. True
freshman wide receiver Steve Stevenson, not true freshman Kareem
Kelly, made the first start of his career. He is believed to be the
first freshman to start a game at wide receiver since Johnnie
Morton in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Arbet returns: USC freshman cornerback Kevin Arbet, who sprained
his ankle early in the Hawaii game &UR;  &LR; and missed last week's game
with San Diego State, suited up against Oregon.

BRUINS FALL FOR FAKE PUNT THAT WASN'T
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ Stanford punter Sean Tolpinrud's play was so
good, the Bruins thought it was a fake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to ask them, but it looked like one to me,''
Bruins coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Tolpinrud's 32-yard fourth-down run was not a called play.
</P>
<P>
   It was pure improvisation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The snap took me to the right, so I started to the right to
get it,'' he said. ``I knew it would be hard to get a punt off, and
I saw nothing but grass. Rather than try to punt, I thought I
better take off and run.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a split-second decision _ one made so naturally that the
Bruins thought it was a fake punt called from the sideline.
Tolpinrud raced 32 yards to UCLA's 18, and on the next play
Stanford scored to take a 35-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a basketball play where a guy shoots a 30-footer and
the coach is saying, `No, no, no, yes,''' Cardinal coach Tyrone
Willingham said. ``The only thing I told Sean to do was get out of
bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   First touch, first touchdown: One of UCLA's biggest plays came
from an unexpected source: freshman Lovell Houston, who returned a
kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown early in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Houston, an oft-injured cornerback, has
touched the ball at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the sideline, and at that point we were (trailing
28-3),'' Houston said. ``I heard coach Toledo call, `Houston.' He
said, `Here's your chance, baby. I'm going to put you in and see
what you get.'''
</P>
<P>
   What Toledo got was UCLA's first kickoff-return touchdown since
JoJo Townsell in 1980. The play re-energized UCLA seconds after
Stanford receiver Troy Walters' 98-yard touchdown reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the one good call I made the whole day,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   QB review: Quarterback Drew Bennett's numbers were impressive _
19 of 31 for 207 yards _ but the passes he missed were more
important than the ones he completed.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett had open receivers all day, but he either didn't see
them or threw the ball too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy-five percent of quarterbacking is knowing what you
see,'' he said. ``I had trouble doing that. You can't be a Division
I quarterback and do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' quarterback situation has not changed. If freshman
Cory Paus (bruised ribs) is healthy, he will start Saturday at
Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Tailback DeShaun Foster gained 100 yards for the
first time this season....
</P>
<P>
   Bruins kicker Chris Griffith missed his first field goal of the
season when the Cardinal blocked a 49-yard attempt in the first
quarter....
</P>
<P>
   Safety Joey Strycula led the Bruins with 11 tackles....
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Tony White's father, Anthony, died of a heart attack
Friday. He was 42. White played against Stanford and made five
tackles....
</P>
<P>
   UCLA reported no significant injuries....
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's Walters needs 56 yards and 24 catches to set the
Pac-10 career record in both categories.....
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins lost despite two penalties and no turnovers....
</P>
<P>
   UCLA lost a conference game for the first time since the
season-opening defeat against Washington State in 1997, a string of
15 wins.

LATE INJURY DOESN'T FAZE MATADORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ It happened again. This time, though, the tactic
wasn't as devious.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal State Northridge coaches didn't know until Saturday
morning that Eastern Washington quarterback Fred Salanoa had a
serious knee injury and wasn't going to play against the visiting
Matadors. Salanoa, who started the Eagles' first three games and
had not practiced since Wednesday, found out Friday afternoon he
had a torn medial meniscus and is out for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Salanoa's replacement, sophomore Chris Samms, was 9 of 18 for
132 yards and no touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kearin, CSUN's interim head coach, said Salanoa's absence
didn't have any effect on the Matadors' defensive strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were going to run the ball,'' Kearin said.
``(Head coach Mike) Kramer said he didn't know anything about
(Salanoa) until he walked off the practice field Friday, after I
had already talked to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation involving Salanoa is similar to last year's
hidden-injury fiasco against Montana, when the Grizzles chose not
to report a back injury to All-American quarterback Brian Ah Yat,
who didn't suit up in CSUN's 21-7 win.
</P>
<P>
   Missing man:!off When Samms got hurt in the third quarter,
almost forcing the Eagles to use third-string Lance Hattemer, a
junior college transfer with no Division I-AA experience, thoughts
drifted to Griffin Garske.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Garske? He started 10 games for the Eagles last year,
and threw for 404 yards against CSUN. But he quit the team after
the season when he was told by Kramer that he wasn't going to be
the starter this season.
</P>
<P>
   There's no place like it: It took four years, but Patrick Cwik
finally got a chance to play in front of his family.
</P>
<P>
   Cwik, a senior backup linebacker at CSUN, is from nearby
Spokane. He transferred to Northridge from Hancock College in 1997
and the Matadors hosted Eastern Washington last year.
</P>
<P>
   Chazz Moore, a senior cornerback from Portland, also had family
attend the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sparkling effort: Senior safety Rahman Sparks saved a touchdown
in the first quarter when he knocked the ball out of tight end Dan
Curley's hands in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Curley was getting ready to cradle the ball when Sparks' big hit
jarred it loose.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks later left the game with what the CSUN trainers called
rib contusions. He is doubftul for next week's home game against
Idaho State.
</P>
<P>
   Two firsts: Senior linebacker Jack Heaslet got his first
interception as a Matador when he picked off Samms near the CSUN
goal line in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Moore got his first interception of the season, and third of his
career, in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Embarassing! Once again, CSUN hurt itself with penalties. The
Matadors committed 10 Saturday for 82 yards, and the worst penalty
could have been a personal foul on backup quarterback Josh Fiske.
Fiske was called for a late hit on a kickoff return in the first
half.

CARDINAL OFFENSE EXPLOITS UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAMONA SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ Stanford had the playmakers. UCLA didn't.
</P>
<P>
   True to Pacific 10 Conference form, neither team looked
especially good on defense and that was the difference as the
Cardinal exploited UCLA's defensive weaknesses in a 42-32 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford totalled 672 yards of total offense, an onslaught that
attacked the Bruins from every possible angle.
</P>
<P>
   Preseason All-America Troy Walters had 278 yards receiving and
three touchdowns. Backup quarterback and former Camarillo star Joe
Borchard came off the bench to throw for 324 yards and five
touchdowns, including a 14-yarder to DeRonnie Pitts in the fourth
quarter that put the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our game plan is to get the ball to our playmakers. Troy is
one, DeRonnie is one, and David Davis is one,'' Stanford coach
Tyrone Willingham said. ``We're going to get the ball to them in a
position where they can make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   That plan was apparent from the start. On Stanford's fourth
play, starting quarterback Todd Husak hooked up with Walters on a
flea-flicker good for a 42-yard gain. The play, and subsequent
scoring drive capped off Kerry Carter's 5-yard touchdown run
epitomized an offense that executed one big strike after another.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Husak left the game in the second quarter with injured
ribs, the Cardinal cruised along, lighting up an inexperienced
Bruins secondary for 465 yards passing, the most UCLA had ever
surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford had six plays for more than 20 yards _ including
Borchard's Pac-10 record-breaking 98-yard touchdown pass to
Walters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a lot of true freshmen out there and that kind of
things shows in a game like this,'' said Pitts, who finished with
two touchdowns and 119 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Borchard, a two-sport star who is more accustomed to making big
plays on the Cardinal's baseball team, performed brilliantly.
Besides the 324 yards passing _ achieved in only three quarters _
he also broke loose on a 56-yard run on third-and-5 midway though
the fourth quarter, extending a drive that eventually resulted in a
Pitts touchdown catch.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it was a case of a playmaker making a play. Pitts caught
the ball at the Bruins' 5-yard line, then hurled himself over the
goal line from about 3 yards out for the touchdown.

USC LOSES IN TRIPLE OT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ USC lost Carson Palmer on Saturday night, but
even that staggering blow could not overshadow an emotional 33-30,
triple-overtime loss to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans went back and forth with the Ducks before finally
succumbing in the third overtime, despite playing the second half
without Palmer, who might have broken his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   USC's David Newbury shanked a 37-yard field goal in the third
overtime, and Oregon won it when third-string kicker Josh Frankel
kicked a 27-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon lost starting kicker Nathan Villegas to a knee injury and
backup kicker Dan Katz missed a field goal in the first extra
period.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams missed field goals in the first overtime and scored
touchdowns in the second.
</P>
<P>
   As memorable as the game was, USC coach Paul Hackett was mostly
upset over the Trojans' performance.
</P>
<P>
   USC set a Pacific-10 Conference game record with 21 penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was not about Oregon, it's about us,'' Hackett said. ``We
had mistakes all over the place. We had a holding penalty on a
touchdown. It's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans nearly won without Palmer, their talented sophomore
quarterback around whom they built so much of their offense, when
he injured his right shoulder in the first half and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look good,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   He would be eligible for a redshirt year if he is forced to miss
the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But at least inside Autzen Stadium, Palmer's injury was
forgotten as the Trojans fought hard without their star
quarterback, and got a wonderful effort from Mike Van Raaphorst
(20-36, 227 yards, one touchdown).
</P>
<P>
   After trailing 20-10, USC scored 13 straight points. But just
when USC seemed to win it, Oregon tied the score 23-23 when
Villegas kicked a 26-yard field goal with 30 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst directed USC on two touchdown drives, including
the go-ahead touchdown with 3:08 left when Chad Morton scored on a
1-yard run. That gave the Trojans a 23-20 lead, but a bad snap
botched the extra point, which would prove crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's hope for a comeback seemed finished when Jason Cooper
fumbled the ensuing kickoff and USC linebacker Aaron Graham
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But David Newbury missed a critical 30-yard field goal with 2:16
left. It turned out to be a costly miss, because Oregon marched
down the field and tied the game with 30 seconds remaining in the
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was forced to watch the game in street clothes in the
second half with his right shoulder in a sling. Oregon lost its two
top tailbacks, Reuben Droughns and Herman Ho-Ching, to injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's injury occurred two plays before the first half ended,
when he scrambled to the sideline and was hit hard by Oregon rover
Michael Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   USC didn't lose its offense without Palmer, as the Trojans moved
the ball consistently with Van Raaphorst. One of Van Raaphorst's
best passes was a 26-yard completion to R. Jay Soward (12 catches,
148 yards) in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But after Soward caught the pass at the Oregon 26, he was hit by
Tamoni Joinder and fumbled. Linebacker Matt Smith recovered the
fumble, and three plays later, Feeley hit Tony Hartley on a 43-yard
gain.
</P>
<P>
   Feeley, who was brilliant most of the game, found Ho-Ching on a
swing pass for a 9-yard touchdown pass that put the Ducks ahead
20-10.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst continued to play admirably, hitting true freshman
Steve Stevenson on a 28-yard pass in the fourth quarter. Tailback
Chad Morton scored on a 2-yard run to cut the deficit to 20-17.
Stevenson injured his left ankle on the reception and did not
return.
</P>
<P>
   The game, between two of the conference's top teams, lived up to
its billing and the Trojans were touting the ramifications even
before the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to determine where we are in the Pac-10 and the
whole season,'' Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   But that analysis became muddled after Palmer's injury. Oregon
suffered its own catastrophe, when tailback Droughns separated his
ribs and tore cartilage and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks found other ways to move the ball without Droughns.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon caught the Trojans off guard on its opening possession of
the second half. With a fourth-and-1 situation at the Oregon 39,
the Ducks lined up to punt. But the snap went to up back Justin
Wilcox, who pitched the ball to punter Kurtis Doerr on an option.
Doerr ended up gaining 30 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The drive eventually stalled at the USC 2-yard line, and Oregon
kicker Nathan Villegas put the Ducks ahead 13-10 with a 19-yard
field goal.
</P>
<P>
   With Palmer, the two teams played a dead even game. That was
reflected in more than the 10-10 halftime score. USC had 17 yards
rushing, Oregon 20. USC had 135 yards passing, Oregon 130. The
Trojans had 152 yards in offense, while the Ducks had 150.
</P>
<P>
   Things could not have started any better for the Trojans.
Droughns fumbled on the first play of the game, and free safety Ife
Ohalete recovered at the Ducks' 24.
</P>
<P>
   USC's first play was a 23-yard pass from Palmer to Stevenson.
The Trojans then proved they can score in their goal-line offense
as Morton ran it in from the 1. Offensive guard Faasea Mailo lined
up at fullback on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon responded later in the quarter by going 65 yards before
its drive stalled at the USC 29. Villegas kicked a 46-yard field
goal to cut the lead to 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Then it got worse for the Trojans. Palmer was intercepted by
free safety McLemore and the Ducks took over at the USC 39.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Enyi Nwamuo had the big play, a 22-yard reception, and
then had a 1-yard touchdown reception just over linebacker Zeke
Moreno's outstretched hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans tied the game 10-10 on the ensuing drive when David
Newbury kicked a 29-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite bringing out loudspeakers in practice, the Trojans
offensive line had five false starts.

 &HT;    CLINTON'S HELP FOR GORE CAMPAIGN COULD ALSO HURT VICE
PRESIDENT'S BID
 &HT;    1000&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) Politics categories
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Standing in the sun-dappled splendor of the Rose
Garden last week, President Clinton ceremoniously killed the
centerpiece of the Republican legislative agenda _ a $792 billion
tax cut _ with the stroke of a pen.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vetoed the package, he said, to protect the country from
a return to the ravages of Republican policies he blamed for
quadrupling the federal debt, raising interest rates and stifling
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore and I came into office determined to
change all that, with a new economic strategy focused on fiscal
discipline, expanded trade, investment in our people,'' said
Clinton. ``This strategy has worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks, it turns out, are part of yet another
strategy, this one intended to help Al Gore succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore trailing Republican frontrunner George W. Bush by
nearly 20 points in national polls, and former Sen. Bill Bradley
mounting a surprisingly strong challenge as a Democratic
alternative to the vice president, Clinton is looking for ways to
help his second-in-command.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the formula is to use every opportunity _ a presidential
veto power with a White House backdrop, for example _ to associate
Gore with the successes of the Clinton administration, beginning
with an economy that has grown nearly 40 percent since Clinton took
office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done more with the job he's had the last six and a half
years than any person in history,'' Clinton told two dozen wealthy
Democratic donors attending a Gore fund raising dinner last week in
a dark-paneled room at the Hay-Adams Hotel, across from the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, though, helping Gore's campaign is a far more
complicated proposition than simply sharing the presidential
spotlight and proffering accolades and toasts.
</P>
<P>
   His own presidency is indelibly stained by scandal. There are
signs that the public is weary of Clinton and his political and
personal entourage. And when he plays to his rhetorical strengths
it often only highlights Gore's own limitations in connecting with
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's role in helping Gore, in other words, is heavily
circumscribed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Clinton can help him only in a very careful sort of
way,'' said Brown University political science professor Darrell
West. ``He can't be heavy-handed about helping him.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidents have a natural tendency to be cautious in promoting
their number-twos, whether because of petty jealousy, professional
egotism or reservations borne of working closely with them for four
or more years.
</P>
<P>
   Few vice presidents have won election to replace their bosses.
In 1988, George Bush became the first sitting vice president to be
elected to the top job since Martin Van Buren's win 152 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The White House insists that Clinton very much wants Gore to be
the next president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you with 100 percent certainty that he's not
ambivalent,'' said Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Lockhart, Clinton views Gore's campaign as
something of a mission, one key to the Clinton legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He honestly believes that we've changed the way we do business
in this town,'' said Lockhart. ``It's very important to him that we
build on this success, rather than undo many of the steps we've
taken to move forward, and he thinks that the vice president's the
best person to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the best way to help Gore, though, is dicey.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things any vice president seeking the
presidency must do is convince the public that, after years of
playing a supporting role, he's suddenly ready to lead.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton to take an aggressive approach in the selling of Al
Gore might only underscore Clinton's leadership abilities, not
Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem for a vice president always is to establish
themselves as their own person without repudiating their boss,''
said Jonathan Siegel, director of the Harris Interactive Election
2000, a project of the Rochester, N.Y.,-based Harris polling
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to Al Gore to both have the message and the ability to
communicate it,'' said Siegel. ``Bill Clinton can't do it for him,
his handlers can't do it and his advisers can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore appears to suffer, moreover, in areas where Clinton is
strong.
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken Sept. 10-14 among 1,698 Americans by the Gallup
Organization shows Gore trailing George W. Bush by 19 points in
people's perceptions of Gore's effectiveness as a manager; by 16
points in his ability to affect change; and by 20 points in his
ability to inspire others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the same things that Clinton has done well on
historically,'' said Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup
Polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``How Bill Clinton transfers those kinds of characteristics onto
Gore is a real challenge,'' said Newport. ``I don't think that you
can do that by osmosis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore-Clinton equation is further complicated by Clinton's
impeachment-marred conduct in office. Enough Americans from both
parties still regard Clinton's behavior as sufficiently
reprehensible, and his impact on the office as sufficiently
corrosive, that Gore stands to suffer, in some quarters at least,
by association.
</P>
<P>
   At best, Clinton polarized much of the nation, splitting the
electorate into Clinton supporters and Clinton despisers. That's
left precious little of the ideological middle ground over which
presidential campaigns are fought.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were Al Gore, would I really want Bill Clinton going
around and campaigning for me,'' wondered Roger Hartley, who
teaches government at Roanoke College in Salem, Va. ``The president
is kind of a lightning rod.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from those who feel strongly one way or the other about
Clinton, there appears to be a substantial portion of the American
public that has simply overdosed on the rich media diet of Clinton
fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this phenomenon out there, Clinton fatigue, that
makes it hard for Clinton to go out there and help Gore,'' said Dan
Thomas, professor of political science at Warburg College in
Waverly, Iowa. ``It could amount to the kiss of death.''

</P>
<P>
   One group that is anything but fatigued, however, consists of
the long-term Democratic Party stalwarts who recall with a shudder
the party's pre-Clinton malaise. They credit the president, despite
his faults, for having reinvented and reinvigorated the entire
party.
</P>
<P>
   These backers turn out en masse at fund-raisers and rallies,
where Clinton invariably receives a rock star's reception. He
remains able to electrify a crowd like no other politician of his
generation. To the extent that's useful to Gore, Clinton is
prepared to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If going out and raising money is helpful he's going to do
that. If going and making appearances is helpful he's going to do
that,'' said Lockhart. ``If staying here and concentrating on
getting things done is helpful he's going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   As a backdrop for appearing presidential, it's hard to beat the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   West said he would expect to see Clinton do everything possible
in the months ahead to portray Gore as a co-partner in the
administration's achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do it by sharing credit, making sure the vice president
gets a lot of press, giving him positive announcements to make and
sending him to foreign funerals, where he can look presidential and
meet with foreign leaders,'' said West.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Clinton and Gore will both face the limits on what
one man can do for another. Public perceptions aren't always easily
swayed and no amount of praise from a figure of boundless charisma
can create the same persona in another.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's hurting Gore currently,'' said Newport, ``is Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   What's clear, though, is that those who thought Clinton had
waged his last campaign were wrong. He's embarked on at least one
more _ this time, for Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've been going through this campaign all my
life,'' Clinton said Friday in a speech to members of the
Democratic National Committee, ``and I'm not even running.''

 &HT;    CLINTON'S HELP FOR GORE CAMPAIGN COULD ALSO HURT VICE
PRESIDENT'S BID
 &HT;    1000&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) Politics categories
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Standing in the sun-dappled splendor of the Rose
Garden last week, President Clinton ceremoniously killed the
centerpiece of the Republican legislative agenda _ a $792 billion
tax cut _ with the stroke of a pen.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vetoed the package, he said, to protect the country from
a return to the ravages of Republican policies he blamed for
quadrupling the federal debt, raising interest rates and stifling
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore and I came into office determined to
change all that, with a new economic strategy focused on fiscal
discipline, expanded trade, investment in our people,'' said
Clinton. ``This strategy has worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks, it turns out, are part of yet another
strategy, this one intended to help Al Gore succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore trailing Republican frontrunner George W. Bush by
nearly 20 points in national polls, and former Sen. Bill Bradley
mounting a surprisingly strong challenge as a Democratic
alternative to the vice president, Clinton is looking for ways to
help his second-in-command.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the formula is to use every opportunity _ a presidential
veto power with a White House backdrop, for example _ to associate
Gore with the successes of the Clinton administration, beginning
with an economy that has grown nearly 40 percent since Clinton took
office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done more with the job he's had the last six and a half
years than any person in history,'' Clinton told two dozen wealthy
Democratic donors attending a Gore fund raising dinner last week in
a dark-paneled room at the Hay-Adams Hotel, across from the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, though, helping Gore's campaign is a far more
complicated proposition than simply sharing the presidential
spotlight and proffering accolades and toasts.
</P>
<P>
   His own presidency is indelibly stained by scandal. There are
signs that the public is weary of Clinton and his political and
personal entourage. And when he plays to his rhetorical strengths
it often only highlights Gore's own limitations in connecting with
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's role in helping Gore, in other words, is heavily
circumscribed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Clinton can help him only in a very careful sort of
way,'' said Brown University political science professor Darrell
West. ``He can't be heavy-handed about helping him.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidents have a natural tendency to be cautious in promoting
their number-twos, whether because of petty jealousy, professional
egotism or reservations borne of working closely with them for four
or more years.
</P>
<P>
   Few vice presidents have won election to replace their bosses.
In 1988, George Bush became the first sitting vice president to be
elected to the top job since Martin Van Buren's win 152 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The White House insists that Clinton very much wants Gore to be
the next president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you with 100 percent certainty that he's not
ambivalent,'' said Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Lockhart, Clinton views Gore's campaign as
something of a mission, one key to the Clinton legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He honestly believes that we've changed the way we do business
in this town,'' said Lockhart. ``It's very important to him that we

 &HT;    Judge refuses to allow Jesse James' body to be exhumed
 &HT;    By Brad Reagan
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARLIN, Texas _ From the third row of a Falls County courtroom,
Byron Courtney Jr. strained to hear the words of the attorneys
arguing up front.
</P>
<P>
   At 83, Courtney couldn't make out the details of the dialogue,
but he knew they were jousting over whether his grandfather, the
man who practically raised him, was really the outlaw Jesse James.
</P>
<P>
   To Courtney, his grandfather was ``a man of honor and a man of
his word,'' not a murderer and bank robber.
</P>
<P>
   Or was he? Courtney's family is bitterly divided over the
identity of its patriarch. It is an emotional dispute that was
heard in court recently, but it may never be resolved to everyone's
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney, of Waco, is one of a faction at odds with Liberty Hill
resident Betty Dorsett Duke over her 1998 book, ``Jesse James Lived
and Died in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke says James L. Courtney, her great-great-grandfather, was
actually the notorious gunman who most historians believe was shot
in the back of the head in 1882 by Bob Ford. Duke says she believes
James pulled ``one of the biggest bluffs in American history'' by
faking his death and living out the rest of his days as a farmer
near Blevins in Falls County.
</P>
<P>
   Tales that James faked his death and moved to Texas are nothing
new.
</P>
<P>
   According to one story, he moved to Granbury, near Fort Worth,
and lived under the name J. Frank Dalton until he died in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1992, two brothers claiming to be James'
great-grandsons showed up in Waco to look for $14 million in gold
they said he buried there. They never found it.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Duke produced photos showing similarities between
James and Courtney and between their mothers, and she noted that
census records revealed no listing for James L. Courtney before
James' death. She also produced a diary entry by Courtney that
appears to be signed ``J. James.''
</P>
<P>
   Although not totally convinced, some historians and Western lore
enthusiasts refused to dismiss Duke's claim. And after the first
edition of the book was released, Willie Ford, a descendant of
James' alleged shooter, Bob Ford, wrote Duke to weigh in that his
family long believed James' death was faked, Duke said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the book came out, the family split into two factions. One
believes there is a good chance James L. Courtney was Jesse James.
The other, the larger of the two, thinks the mere thought is a
disgrace to the man's memory.
</P>
<P>
   To settle the matter once and for all, Duke asked Falls County
Judge Michael Meyer to exhume Courtney's body in order to compare
DNA samples from the body with samples from known descendants of
Jesse James.
</P>
<P>
   The same procedure was done in 1995 on remains buried near
Kearney, Mo. Tests showed that body was that of James, but Duke
says she believes those tests were flawed. As historian James E.
Starrs, who oversaw the 1995 exhumation, once observed, ``Legends
die hard, and Jesse James legends die hardest of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron Courtney Jr. fought the exhumation with the support of
most of the rest of the family during a five-hour hearing Friday,
Sept. 17, in Marlin. Max Courtney, a forensic scientist in Fort
Worth and a great-grandson of James L. Courtney, testified that
some of Duke's photographs appear to have been doctored.
</P>
<P>
   The photos purport to show that James L. Courtney's mother and
Jesse James' mother were both missing their right arm, but Max
Courtney produced an original photograph that he said showed that
Duke's photo had been reversed and otherwise altered to make it
appear that Courtney's mother was missing an arm.
</P>
<P>
   Duke said two photograph experts told her the photos showed a
match between the two women. She said she had no knowledge of the
photo being reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Duke and her daughter, Teresa, both broke down on the stand
while testifying, but they received little sympathy from the other
family members. At one point, as Teresa Duke testified that a
Courtney elder once confessed that he believed Courtney was Jesse
James, a prim elderly woman in a pink pantsuit leaned over to her
husband and whispered loudly, ``That's crap.''
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Teresa Duke asked Meyer to approve the exhumation on
the grounds that ``maybe the families will unite and stop all this
fighting and bickering.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in his ruling Meyer cited the ``sanctity of the grave''
and ruled that Duke's evidence was not persuasive enough to require
exhumation.
</P>
<P>
   The Courtney family was elated. ``We knew all along it was a
hoax,'' said Byron Courtney Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it's over,'' added Max Courtney.
``That's proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke's attorney, Jim Rodman of Austin, said there is little
chance she will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, Betty Duke vowed to continue her fight.
She said she is not angry with her family, just disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're ashamed. They think of Jesse James as a
cold-blooded killer. They don't take into account that it was
because of the Civil War and his beliefs,'' Duke said. ``I won't
quit. I still believe it.''

`ALLY': LIFE AT THE LAW FIRM, IN SHORTER AND FASTER FORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By CARYN JAMES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Half as long and twice as bad; how did THAT happen? ``Ally,''
the truncated version of old ``Ally McBeal'' episodes, is a tribute
to cynical programming.
</P>
<P>
   When the half-hour ``Ally'' was announced as a sort-of-new
series, it was said to include pieces that had been left out of the
hourlong originals, along with some newly shot material. A show
made up of such grace notes might have been flimsy, but not
charmless.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's premiere was not sent out for review because three new
scenes had just been filmed. But several other episodes were
available, and there is not a single unfamiliar scene among them.
They reveal the wrongheaded ``Ally'' approach: cut everything
except the main plot, without a grace note left.
</P>
<P>
   So next week Ally (Calista Flockhart) saves the life of an obese
lawyer. He falls in love with her; she almost ruins his wedding,
but then she doesn't. End of story. No one cares. (Though it is
amusing to see her bounce on the man's chest, trying to give CPR
with her derriere instead of her weakling's hands.)
</P>
<P>
   With all but the skeletal plot cut away, it becomes clear how
much the full-length ``Ally McBeal'' relies on throwaway moments of
lunacy. All those times when characters break into dance in the
bathroom are far more engaging than the self-important courtroom
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   There are new transitions linking scenes in ``Ally,'' speeded-up
glimpses of people zooming along the sidewalk. They are bludgeoning
reminders that we are seeing the faster version.
</P>
<P>
   But this quicker ``Ally'' is more frustrating than entertaining,
and the concept will not improve when a few fresh scenes are tossed
in. The series offers the Fox network a cheap way to sell more
advertising. It doesn't offer viewers anything they can't get with
a VCR and a fast-forward button.
</P>

MICROSOFT ACTS ON DIGITAL MUSIC BY GETTING SUPPORT FROM CIRRUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SARA ROBINSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Trying to gain a stronger foothold in the
burgeoning digital music market, Microsoft Corp. plans to announce
on Monday that the newest line of Internet audio chips from Cirrus
Logic will support Microsoft's Windows Media Audio format.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, portable digital music players and other devices
built with the Cirrus chip would be able to play music encoded with
Windows Media technology. Moreover, the right to use the Microsoft
technology is included in the price of the chip.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, manufacturers of digital music devices must pay
royalties to the companies that developed the software technology
they support. For instance, to support the popular MP3 format for
converting music to digital form, manufacturers pay licensing fees
to the patent holder, the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement aims to encourage the development of devices that
support Windows Media, thus giving musicians and record companies
more incentive to release music in the Microsoft format.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is Windows Media everywhere,'' said Anthony Bay,
general manager of the streaming media division at Microsoft, who
indicated that the company may be pursuing similar pacts with other
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes as developers of portable devices begin to
support multiple audio formats. Consumers also show strong support
for multiple-format devices, said Richard Doherty, president of
Envisioneering, a market research firm. ``Who wants to buy a record
player that can only play 45 rpm records?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Cirrus plans to make the new chips available to manufacturers
within two weeks so that Windows Media-enabled devices can be
released in time for the holiday retail season.
</P>
<P>
   Cirrus is a leading supplier of audio components, but no
existing portable player uses Cirrus chips. Matthew Perry, general
manager of the embedded processors unit at Cirrus, said he expected
Cirrus chips to be in the next generation of players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on customer interest, we estimate that next year there
will be several players with our parts in them,'' he said.

<P>
   In a conglomerate-driven world, investors expect big companies
to own more than one brand. Viacom operates MTV and VH1. Coca-Cola
sells Diet Coke and Tab.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether this business model can work in the
still-forming and highly volatile market of Internet service
providers. The first such attempt in this industry _ America
Online's ownership of its former rival, Compuserve _ suggests that
the answer is yes, even if serious challenges remain in keeping the
new brand profitable.

   America Online said last week that so far in its fiscal first
quarter, which will end on Thursday, the long-struggling Compuserve
added 300,000 subscribers. Although the company declines to give a
total subscribership, industry estimates now place the figure at
2.3 million _ which would still be well below Compuserve's peak of
3.6 million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, there is an easy explanation for the recent
upswing: Since the quarter began, Compuserve has offered cash
rebates to new subscribers who buy certain brands of computers and
agree to sign up for three years of Internet access at $21.95 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The rebates notwithstanding, AOL executives consider the surge
in Compuserve subscriptions a sign of healthy growth in a cutthroat
industry, and a measure of redemption. When the company acquired
Compuserve in 1997, it predicted the dawning of a multiple-brand
era in the Internet access market, a view that industry analysts
doubted would be fulfilled so soon.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's premise is that the Internet access market will
fragment into different consumer tiers _ budget or ``value'' tiers,
premium tiers and various other levels in between. The company
considers the America Online brand a premium service, for which
subscribers pay $21.95 a month, without rebates, for fare including
19 separate topic ``channels,'' 15,000 chat rooms and a wildly
popular instant-messaging capability. The company considers
Compuserve, which these days is a glorified Internet access
provider offering a smattering of content and chat, a ``value''
brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Hertz and Budget,'' said Audrey Weil, a senior vice
president of AOL and general manager of Compuserve. ``Hertz is the
largest and most dominant,'' Ms. Weil said, ``but Budget has a
brand name you've heard of and that is a good alternative in the
value space.'' The analogy extends only so far, of course: Hertz
does not own Budget, and in some places, their rental rates are
similar.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's reasoning differs from the conventional wisdom
about the market for Internet service providers. Until very
recently, many industry executives and analysts predicted that
providing Internet access service was a business that would go the
way of utilities; as with electricity, consumers would care little
who provided access so long as the electrons flowed.
</P>
<P>
   But America Online executives have taken a different view,
especially the company's president and chief operating officer,
Robert W. Pittman. Formerly president of MTV Networks, Pittman
oversaw development of the VH1 brand in 1985 (which at the time he
said he envisioned as MTV for ``old folks, dullard, the not so
hip'') and he is a flag-waver for the many-brand business model.
</P>
<P>
   So is Steve Case, America Online's chairman, who in an interview
cited AOL's acquisitions of Netscape and the instant-messaging
service ICQ. ``We've migrated into being a multibrand company,''
Case said.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the Compuserve brand specifically will thrive
remains in question. Before the recent rash of Compuserve
subscriptions, membership had been languishing since America
Online's 1997 deal to acquire Compuserve, which had suffered a long
decline under the ownership of H &AMP; R Block. Elsewhere, though, the
Internet access market has been booming _ led by America Online's
own flagship service, which has grown to more than 18 million from
11 million since the company bought Compuserve.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the purchase, America Online laid off 500
Compuserve employees and began to shift back-room and technology
operations from Compuserve headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, to the
parent company's home in Reston, Va. America Online says that by
sharing such costs, it was immediately able to turn Compuserve
profitable, although it has declined to give specific figures.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the first real subscriber growth by Compuserve under
its new ownership has come only since America Online began offering
the rebates _ $400 with the purchase of certain computers, if a
subscriber signs up for three years of Compuserve, and $100 with PC
purchases if the customer agrees to a one-year subscription. The
viability of this business model has been questioned by competitors
and some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A $400 rebate up front is uneconomical; they're not going to
make any money,'' said Charles Betty, president and chief executive
of Earthlink, which agreed last week to a merger with Mindspring
that would form the nation's second-largest Internet service
provider after America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the rebate offer of $400 a customer _ which does not
include Compuserve's marketing costs _ exceeds the $180 to $200
that Betty said Earthlink pays to gain a new subscriber. But
Pittman, while declining to give specific figures, said Compuserve
can operate in the black under the rebate arrangement because of
its technology-sharing relationship with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going after the price buyer,'' Pittman said, adding
that Compuserve would accept lower profit margins than AOL. ``We
will live with the smallest margin we can live with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are other outstanding questions. A survey this month by
J.D. Power &AMP; Associates of customer satisfaction among seven top
Internet service providers found that Compuserve ranked second from
the bottom and America Online ranked dead last, according to Peter
Dresch, director of media relations for J.D. Power in Agoura Hills,
Calif. The others, in descending rank of satisfaction, were
Mindspring, Earthlink, AT&AMP;T Worldnet, Microsoft MSN and Prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Compuserve, customers ranked the service as below
average in four of the survey's categories: cost and billing,
e-mail services, navigation and ease of use. Ms. Weil, of
Compuserve, said she expected consumer responses to improve with
time.
</P>
<P>
   AOL challenged the survey, asserting that it included few users
of the latest version of Compuserve _ Compuserve 2000, which was
introduced in February. The J.D. Power survey was conducted
starting in July, but the bulk of Compuserve 2000 users, AOL said,
were added after the survey was conducted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Two decades old, Compuserve was among the first big-name online
communities, and it was originally populated with technology-savvy,
business-oriented subscribers for whom Compuserve was both a
community and a research tool. It was also among the first services
to substantially expand overseas, but its growth languished as the
emergence of the Internet spelled the end of proprietary online
communities built on the old Compuserve model.
</P>
<P>
   The new crowd of price-oriented users is a different breed.
America Online maintains an existing hourly pricing plan for what
it calls the ``classic'' Compuserve clientele, vs. people who opt
for the Compuserve 2000 service to which the rebates apply.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of America Online's acquisition of Compuserve, there
was much gnashing of teeth by old-guard users about the arrival of
the newbies. But such tensions seem to have passed, said Mike
Bayer, who has been a Compuserve member since 1981 and a volunteer
system operator for Compuserve since 1984 and is now an online
forum leader. The company declines to say how many current
customers are holdovers from the old days, but Bayer estimates that
it is about one-third of the total.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a question about whether Compuserve's success
might be a burden to America Online, if the popularity of the
rebates could cannibalize the premium brand, said Scott E. Reamer,
director of Internet research for S.G. Cowen, the New York-based
brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Reamer said investors would want to watch the next several
quarters carefully to see if America Online can continue its own
impressive growth while Compuserve grows, too. But right now, he
said, the Compuserve acquisition is starting to look good for
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really expected much from Compuserve when AOL bought
it,'' he said. ``They've turned it around.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a very personal and uplifting story of my life as a
writer. I will include intimate confessions. The following is a
typical day in my life.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes open up. Birds singing outside window. Oh, yes, and there
is the husband. X-rated stuff happens. (Delete details.)
</P>
<P>
   Must go out with dogs. They have a dog door and a half-acre
fenced in with trees and a little brook, but that isn't good
enough. ... No, they have to have  &UR; me  &LR; go with them, so we can be a
pack together.
</P>
<P>
   Typewriter with page 1,994 of novel screams from another room: I
WANT YOU.
</P>
<P>
   I am scrambling to get dressed because the dogs are waiting at
the foot of the stairs for  &UR; the pack thing,  &LR; which hasn't happened
yet. They are hopping up and down. These are Scottish terriers with
short legs, big heads, beady eyes and beards, and when I look at
them, I melt and will do anything they want.
</P>
<P>
   But at this moment I am still scrambling to get dressed, and the
typewriter is starting to really scream and kind of whimper from
the other room. A truck pulls up in the yard, a member of our
political group, one of those working-class politics groups you
hear so much about.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bang! Bang! Bang! &LR;  This is knuckles knocking on door.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs charge the door.
</P>
<P>
   Cuckoo clock coo coos six times.
</P>
<P>
   Husband is now scrambling to get dressed.
</P>
<P>
   Phone does not ring. Its bell is broken. It never rings. Thank
heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Typewriter is starting to gasp and moan.
</P>
<P>
   All dressed, I race down the attic stairs and the  &UR; pack  &LR; is
racing around, the dogs throwing themselves at the door behind
which the guest stands.
</P>
<P>
   The dishes heaped in the sink make no sound. No screams. No
barking. But they have one of those  &UR; profound  &LR; presences. I am a
person who can't teach writing or make a living in any public way,
as I get confused when interrupted or overstimulated. In a
classroom or crowded room, I all but blank out.
</P>
<P>
   So my only income is from novels. This should explain the
absence of dishwasher, clothes dryer, running hot water,
electricity in all rooms, health insurance and other such luxuries.
The Scotties we got through friends. So don't go rolling your eyes
about those ``expensive Scotties.''
</P>
<P>
   Husband opens front door for guest, as I head out the back door
with  &UR; the pack. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pack  &LR; does its thing, racing around, checking chipmunk holes,
sniffing guest's truck to see what the news is from the outside
world. It is a beautiful morning, and everything smells sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the house, I close dogs in another room, so they
won't bother the guest, who is sitting in a rocking chair with tea
and telling about how upset he is with the latest bad thing the
corporations and government (same thing) have done to us. (I will
delete all his words here in order to keep this an uplifting and
cheery article.)
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs the typewriter is squealing and howling.
</P>
<P>
   The dishes are deathly quiet.
</P>
<P>
   I set the water kettles on the stove to heat, for dishes and
baths and to get oatmeal started. Fetch the broom.
</P>
<P>
   I get out the heartworm pills and line them up on the sideboard.
(That's what us old Mainers call what you all call a counter.)
</P>
<P>
   The guest is really upset and depressed. I sweep the broom
around his chair and listen, and the husband is talking too about
his troubles. He has plenty of troubles, too, as he is like me, not
a marketable person.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays you are supposed to be marketable. Or you are
unmarketable. Within the marketable group there are the house
slaves (professional class) and the field slaves (working class).
But some of us don't even make it to the auction block. So we are
pretty upset. This might be taking this article out of the
``uplifting'' into the ``uh-oh,'' so I'll switch now to how pretty
the birds sound at the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Guest leaves after another cup of tea.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs line up for their heartworm pills.
</P>
<P>
   Clock coo coos seven times.
</P>
<P>
   Typewriter screams.
</P>
<P>
   I do some dishes and take my bath and clock coo coos eight times
and typewriter screams, and one of the Scotties starts to have a
grand mal seizure. I hold her so she won't smash her skull on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Truck pulls up in the yard. Another guest, this a person who has
read my latest book (the one with all the violence and class rage),
and she comes in and sits in a rocker after we drive all the
barking dogs out the dog door, except for the one that is dizzy and
wet from her seizure, Florence, who I hold.
</P>
<P>
   Husband goes out to split wood. Person tells me her name again
and how hard she and her husband work, and yet they are losing
everything and experiencing depression and rage, which they never
experienced before. They have always been able to ``keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   Typewriter screams.
</P>
<P>
   I hear nine coo coos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea?'' I ask the guest.
</P>
<P>
   I hold Florence under one arm, make the tea.
</P>
<P>
   Husband rushes in and tells me that Helen has been eating dirt
again. This could mean an emergency trip to the vet's to have her
pumped out. Helen is one of the Scotties.
</P>
<P>
   By the time there are 10 coo coos, guest has left. Dogs are
lying around on the rockers. Husband has gone to town for the mail.
</P>
<P>
   I finish hanging the laundry and go up to the typewriter and sit
there, holding my head trying to quiet my head. You see, I can't
just switch from  &UR; life  &LR; mode to  &UR; writer  &LR; mode. Usually it takes
three days to get into the  &UR; writer  &LR; mode. Three days of quiet
non- &UR; life  &LR; mode, lots of coffee and no interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Writing is like meditation or going into an ESP trance, or
prayer. Like dreaming. You are tapping into your unconscious. To be
fully conscious and  &UR; alert,  &LR; with  &UR; life  &LR; banging and popping and
cuckooing all around, you are not going to find your way to your
subconscious, which is a place of complete submission.  &UR; Complete
submission. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I open my eyes. I look at the page. I type a couple of lines.
Pop! The ``n'' breaks off the daisy wheel.
</P>
<P>
   These daisy wheels are $30 apiece! My old well-made typewriter
had  &UR; one  &LR; daisy wheel, which lasted 11 years. But this is a new
typewriter. The cheesy typewriters they make now use three daisy
wheels a day. My mind abandons  &UR; writer mode. &LR;  I am now in  &UR; crisis
 &LR; mode again. Ninety dollars a day for daisy wheels for a person who
makes $2 an hour (what I figure I make) is pretty ugly.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   U.P.S. truck pulls up. Dogs hurtle out the dog door into their
pen and throw selves against the fence wire to show the U.P.S. man
what will happen to him if he comes in the house. I run downstairs
and out, so I can sign for the packages. Eight galleys from eight
publishers wanting eight blurbs. Blurbs are those little
positive-sounding quotes on the backs of books. I am not much of a
reader. No time. It takes me two to six months to read a book, so
these guys are definitely barking up the wrong tree.
</P>
<P>
   U.P.S. truck heads out and down the long dirt road and away.
</P>
<P>
   I start back up the attic stairs to the gasping weeping
typewriter, and husband arrives home with mail. Three more galleys
in the mail, plus 20 letters and cards, most of which are urgent,
or at least requiring a letter in return. Not many bills. Just our
one  &UR; huge  &LR; mortgage on the house that we had to take out in order
to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Clock coo coos.
</P>
<P>
   I remember a call I have to make, so I dial the phone. All I get
is an answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   Car pulls in the yard. A whole carload of family. Including a
baby who is about 10 months old and laughs at  &UR; everything. &LR;  He's
kind of bald. His father holds him on his knee, so he can get a
good view of all of us sitting in the circle of rocking chairs. The
baby's mother tells how she's job hunting. Everything is a temp
job, low pay, no bennies.
</P>
<P>
   Baby laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Grandmother says her husband, who is at work at the moment, is
afraid his union is going to get busted.
</P>
<P>
   Baby laughs.
</P>
<P>
   The father, who is unemployed for not being marketable, is
quiet. He adores this baby and keeps whispering stuff in the baby's
ear that makes the baby laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Typewriter screams in the room overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Another carload of people. Neighbors rush in upset. The Drug
Warriors have busted another neighbor for growing enough grass for
just him and his brother to smoke. SWAT team nearly choked his
naked wife (well, partially naked) and himself (he was wearing long
johns) and is now seizing his house, after they stole all his
savings, and he may go to prison for 12 years. The law guys are
trying to scare his wife into testifying against him. You know, the
usual. Telling her she'll lose her kids, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Baby is laughing. So cute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have a seat,'' I tell the new guests, and I set a match under
the tea kettle.
</P>
<P>
   I try the phone again. I get an answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   Clock coo coos 12 times.
</P>
<P>
   I sneak upstairs and make the bed and put away some clothes. My
head feels fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   Another truck pulls up in the yard. It's our old friend who
lived in his truck for years and finally has a little piece of land
with an old school bus to live in, but the town says it is against
codes, and they are trying to terrorize him and kick him out
because a bus is considered dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The baby laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Have a seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you go to the trial Tuesday?'' a guest asks me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' I answer. ``We need to support our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Clock coo coos.
</P>
<P>
   Typewriter is thumping on the ceiling above.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have a seat,'' I tell the newest guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislature is trying to get death penalty passed,'' new guest
tells us.
</P>
<P>
   Baby laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, rich people who kill through corporations and their
poisons and fossil fuels and dangerous working conditions won't get
the death penalty,'' neighbor says with a sigh, sips her tea.
``This is for all us regular folks when we flip out.''
</P>
<P>
   We all look at the baby. He didn't catch this last remark. He's
having his diaper changed while on his father's knees. I always am
amazed at how that is done. I never mastered that knees method with
my own baby and grandbabies.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The mail, not all opened yet, is starting to make noises. Like
the typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   I try the phone again. I get the answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   I figure I'd better feed the husband. He's out splitting wood
again and looking thin. The stove is broke. I make a soup and toss
a little store-bought bread on his bread plate.
</P>
<P>
   I try the phone again.
</P>
<P>
   Clock coo coos.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs are coaxing to do the walk thing again,  &UR; pack  &LR; mode.
</P>
<P>
   After the meal and the walk and three more times on the phone
and Florence has another seizure, I go up to the typewriter. I sit
awhile trying to quiet my head. I type a couple of sentences, and
another $30 daisy wheel bites the dust.
</P>
<P>
   I hear another vehicle in the yard. Just someone visiting the
husband, a guy from town bringing him flags for his cemetery work.
</P>
<P>
   But I can't concentrate with  &UR; anybody  &LR; around, so I figure I'll
look at the mail. I.R.S. wants paperwork. Which reminds me, we need
to register the truck. About five letters from people doing short
story collections who want a short story cheap, and a literacy
group in Washington state would like me to fly out at my own
expense and do a reading to help them raise money. Political mail.
Emergencies. No checks. Nothing even like a check. Mean reviews.
People who say my work has too much working-class rage.
</P>
<P>
   Clock coo coos.
</P>
<P>
   Car pulls up. Husband is gone out to do errands, so I herd the
barking, snarling dogs out the dog door and usher the guest in.
It's our friend Pete. Labor organizer, historian and professional
troublemaker. He finds his favorite rocker while I make tea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to give you a test,'' he tells me with a chuckle. He
proceeds to ask me questions about the making of the Constitution,
like what percent of the population in 1776 was slaves and
indentured servants and other people not considered human by ``the
Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-five percent,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   He grunts unhappily. ``You know too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The typewriter screams.
</P>
<P>
   Clock coo coos four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's your book coming along?'' Pete asks.
</P>
<P>
   I laugh.

`RED FILES': THE ROSENBERGS AND OTHER SPIES, EXPOSED BY RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Program notes at end of review. Time, channel are for New

 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Count it as an unanticipated bonus of the end of the Cold War:
Secret KGB files have been opened for the inspection of Western
scholars, and former Soviet spymasters have been boasting to
reporters of their achievements in purloining America's
technological know-how. The information provided and the deductions
they invite have at least (and, one hopes, at last) put an end to
the cottage industries that for decades proclaimed the innocence of
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and others of any spying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red Files: Secret Victories of the KGB,'' the opening hour of
a four-part PBS series (the subsequent three weekly reports go
behind the scenes of Soviet sports, the Soviet moon mission and
Soviet propaganda), focuses on the careers of Morris and Lona
Cohen, an American couple of Communist persuasion whose names long
ago surfaced in studies of espionage at Los Alamos when the atomic
bomb was being developed. Now, with the help of former Soviet and
Western agents, the Cohens' story is told in more detail, revealing
the impulses that drew scores of Westerners into the service of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Cohen, a New Yorker, was recruited by Soviet intelligence
in Spain where he fought and was wounded with the Communist-led
Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the 1930s. Like other spies _ one source
says there were at least 125 in the United States _ he served not
for money but for ideology.
</P>
<P>
   George Blake, an important British agent who would wind up, like
the Cohens, being arrested and freed in a prisoner swap, is seen
saying he still believes he was helping to build a new society,
and, ``It is never wrong to give your life to a noble ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, when Cohen was in the Army, his wife passed
industrial secrets to her Soviet handlers. Her biggest assignment
was to pick up material from a Los Alamos physicist, Ted Hall. She
hid the secrets in an uninspected Kleenex box, which a security
guard gallantly returned to her after he had searched her other
belongings. The narrator credits Mrs. Cohen and Americans of like
opinions with helping to give the Soviets the information they
needed to detonate a bomb of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The names of Klaus Fuchs, Kim Philby, Gordon Londsdale and other
notorious Soviet agents also figure in ``Red Files.'' As for the
Rosenbergs, a former Soviet agent says that Rosenberg provided
``invaluable intelligence about radar and sonar,'' but not about
the atom bomb, and he contends that the couple's execution was
unjustified: ``America wanted to kill somebody for the fact that
the Soviet Union so quickly built an atom bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Rosenbergs' arrest in 1950 the Cohens were
spirited out of the United States and then worked for Soviet
intelligence in Moscow and in London, where they were finally
arrested in 1961. They were sentenced to 20 years in prison, but in
1969 they were exchanged, presumably for Western spies, and settled
in the Soviet Union, where they were awarded medals.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end they seemed to have some misgivings. Mrs. Cohen
emphasized to a KGB interrogator at a debriefing that ``no American
soldier died because of what I have done,'' and her husband spoke,
somewhat delicately, about ``mistakes'' that fell upon the Soviet
Union during the Stalin period.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cohen confided to a Russian friend that she would like to
die in the United States, but she and her husband are buried in a
Moscow cemetery.

 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jann Wenner walked into the private dining room that
joins his office at the Wenner Media headquarters on the Avenue of
the Americas, strode to the window and looked up at the Time and
Life Building, towering in the afternoon sun, two blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There it is,'' Wenner said, running a hand over his wavy,
just-graying hair. ``The evil empire. The colossus.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the forbidding Time and Life monolith made Wenner's
media empire _ all one floor of it _ look, well, puny.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, two weeks ago Wenner announced that he would
challenge Time Inc.'s two major entertainment weekly magazines,
People and Entertainment Weekly, by changing the frequency of Us
magazine _ Wenner Media's barely profitable entertainment magazine
_ from monthly to weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The kickoff of Us Weekly, scheduled for March, sets up what will
be one of the most intriguing magazine publishing battles of 2000.
It also raises this question, to use the lingo that gave birth to
Rolling Stone: What is this guy smoking to think he can take on the
reigning kings of journalism lite?
</P>
<P>
   And there's another issue: Is there room, or a need, for even
more celebrity coverage _ coverage that Wenner and his chief
managers freely admit will be friendly and sycophantic?
</P>
<P>
   This David-versus-Goliath gamble will cost Wenner dearly. The
54-year-old publishing magnate, who since founding Rolling Stone
magazine 32 years ago with a loan of $3,000 has been a living
symbol of the boomer generation, said he would spend at least $50
million of his money to transform the moribund Us _ with its
sinking advertising revenue and stalled circulation _ into a
scorching weekly success.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, you think, gee, that's risky,'' Wenner said
over a lunch of sashimi and ginger ale in the private dining room.
He wore a Charvet shirt, gold cuff links and custom-made trousers.
``And you think, wow, that's a lot of money,'' he said. ``My money.
But the payoff of a weekly magazine is enormous. We have a
well-known national brand name and a loyal readership. We have
loyal advertisers. When you look at it as a publishing proposition,
and think about the advertising possibilities, and look at how the
distribution system works, then the whole thing reaches a kind of
critical mass you just can't ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   But the big question is: Why does he need to take such an
enormous risk? After all, he does not need to prove himself: He may
not own the biggest media conglomerate in the world but Wenner
Media _ which publishes Us, Rolling Stone and Men's Journal _ is
generally respected in the industry. Every so often, he said, he is
offered a large sum of money for Rolling Stone, a magazine that
regularly wins National Magazine Awards and serializes the work of
authors like Tom Wolfe. He said the most recent offer was for $500
million, which he turned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking Us weekly is important to me, not as a mission, but
because it is fun,'' he said. ``And I think that a certain amount
of power and influence comes out of a weekly frequency because you
have the power of the news. And, of course,'' he said, dropping his
voice to what could almost be described as a seductive growl, ``I
also think it will be very, very profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Wenner's life has changed dramatically since he was a
22-year-old with a loan from his girlfriend's father and a penchant
for rock music. Once branded ``Boy Wonder'' by the press, Wenner
has become a repository of sorts for an entire generation's hopes
and foibles: As boomers have gone mainstream, so has Wenner, and
even he recognizes that his transformation is starkly evident. When
asked if as a young man he ever thought that he would spend entire
weeks thinking about supermarket racks and distribution systems, he
shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started out, I had no master plan,'' Wenner said. ``The
times were laissez-faire. What was hip was to have a hassle-free
life.'' He arched an eyebrow dramatically, and said: ``But we all
know that little fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   When discussing Men's Journal, which has become more of a
lifestyle magazine than the adventure journal of its original
conception, Wenner departed on a reverie about physical mortality
worthy of Hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to an age where your body is starting to creak and you
start paying attention to yourself,'' he said. ``Your appearance
matters. Fashion and all that stuff. What defines quality of life
is radically different from what it was 30 or 40 years ago.'' He
added: ``You're trying to get the most out of what's left of your
life.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And the ``Boy Wonder'' title, he added, has got to go.
</P>
<P>
   ```Boy Wonder' was amazing. It stuck until I was 45,'' he said.
What would Wenner like to be called now? ``How fast can you leap to
`eminence grise'?'' he asked. (He settled on ``Junior Tycoon.'')
</P>
<P>
   Wenner's life has changed more markedly than most boomers. In
1995, his marriage to Jane Wenner _ the co-founder of Straight
Arrow Publishing, the forebear to Wenner Media _ unraveled when he
began to see a young staff member at Calvin Klein, Matt Nye.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wenners are not divorced, nor are they separated. They
own Wenner Media together, so her financial cooperation is vital to
the success of Us Weekly. Wenner does not deny his relationship
with Nye, but said he chooses not to discuss it or its impact on
his company.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to the extent that Us is involved, she is fully on
board,'' he said of his wife. ``And that's what matters.''
</P>
<P>
   To Time Warner's Time Inc. what matters is the potential for
competition. It has not ignored Wenner. Over the last year, the
company has designated People editors to closely monitor Us
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Time editors admit in private conversation that they are nervous
about the possibility of another weekly celebrity-oriented magazine
competing for space in supermarket checkout lines across the
country, although they add that Time spent $175 million on
Entertainment Weekly before it became profitable.
</P>
<P>
   On the record, editors at People will admit nothing but world
domination. Carol Wallace, the managing editor of People, said: ``A
lot of things keep me up at night but any monthly going weekly sure
isn't one of them. I am so far more concerned about what goes into
our issue than what goes into theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wenner and his general manager, Kent Brownridge, became
convinced of the profitability of taking Us weekly when they first
discussed the notion with an executive at DSI, a magazine
distribution service whose main competitor is _ who else? _ a
Time-Warner subsidiary, Time Distribution Services, the company
that fills supermarket shelves with People and Entertainment Weekly
every week. DSI is owned by American Media, the company that
publishes The National Enquirer. Brownridge admits that he became
fixated on the idea of Us dominating supermarket shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the game is getting retailers to allow you to put
your rack on every single checkout line _ not every other one, not
every third, but every single line,'' Brownridge said. ``So no one
can possibly escape from the store without seeing Us. We're going
to be out there with the carrots and the Campbell's Soup and the
bottles of milk. And a supermarket looks at it like this: How much
profit per square foot can I make? After all, how much do they make
on vegetables? It's a lot of work keeping them fresh. It's a
drag.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharing Brownridge's confidence that magazines sell better than
vegetables, Wenner also said the early Entertainment Weekly
investment is not a good comparison _ that because his magazine is
an existing brand, and has a million readers, he does not need to
spend $175 million. And he does not want to mimic People. Indeed,
there is an almost palpable disdain for People's middlebrow
sensibility at Wenner Media. Terry McDonell, the editor of Men's
Journal, who will be the editor in chief of Us Weekly, said: ``We
will not be showing pictures of surgeons in Houston throwing
frisbees to cocker spaniels, if you get what I mean.'' (His No. 2,
Charles Leerhsen, was previously the deputy managing editor of
People.)
</P>
<P>
   Us Weekly will be more style-oriented (one tentative feature is
titled ``Ten Ways a Celebrity Can Wear a Sarong'') and, as Wenner
said, ``we will be nice to celebrities. A lot of my friends are in
the entertainment business, and People has a terrible relationship
with those people. Famous people hate being in People.'' Wenner's
close friends, he said, include pop singer Robbie Robertson, USA
Networks chief Barry Diller and the actor Michael Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Brownridge said Us would more closely resemble a weekly, young
version of Vanity Fair than it would People.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to focus on young celebrities,'' Brownridge said.
``We're not going to do the little girl who fell down the well or
the three women who got eaten by bears in Yosemite. And we are not
going to look for negative stuff or write nasty sleaze. I don't
think we're going to hire helicopters to fly over Jennifer Aniston
and Brad Pitt's wedding so it sounds like `China Beach' or
`Apocalypse Now' with the choppers overhead. Celebrities are going
to like Us Weekly. It is going to be their friend.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But do readers want celebrity-friendly coverage _ a formula that
has worked so well for Time's In Style _ in a weekly magazine? Some
in the advertising industry are skeptical. Roberta Garfinkle, the
director of print media at the advertising agency McCann-Erickson,
said her general prognosis was unsure. ``Will they be able to hold
their circulation?'' she asked. ``Will they be able to
consistently, week after week, deliver a relevant newsworthy
celebrity magazine? I think that's really tough, and I am not sure
if he knows what he has gotten himself into.''
</P>
<P>
   E. Daniel Capell, an expert in magazine circulation and the
editor of Capell's Circulation Report, said the critical issue is
that Us is barely meeting its rate base _ the circulation
guaranteed to advertisers _ as it is. ``So what happens to the
newsstand sale which they are not getting in 30 days if you go
weekly?'' he said. ``It seems to me to be awfully difficult to
maintain, let alone increase, circulation if you go to a weekly
frequency. That's an awful lot of sales to get in seven days you're
not even getting in 30 days.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gene DeWitt, the president of DeWitt Media, which places ads
for clients like BMW, said Wenner is ``crazy like a fox. The
advertising demand is there for it, because marketing has
accelerated and we need more weekly venues.'' He said that with a
weekly schedule, advertisers will be better able to time their ads
to their promotional needs, a necessity for car manufacturers whose
rebate schedules and sale dates can change at the last minute, and
for entertainment companies whose movie release dates and
promotional plans change frequently.
</P>
<P>
   If half of creating a profitable magazine is healthy
advertising, then the other half must surely be plain mojo. And
Wenner's got plenty of it. In discussing his friend and semi-rival,
Art Cooper, the editor in chief of the men's magazine GQ, Wenner
said: ``Art is funny, you know. He loves to go around saying that
he is the best magazine editor in America.'' Wenner paused, let his
eyebrows wriggle for dramatic effect, then added: ``But of course,
that's me.''

A DEADLY REGATTA SPURS RACE TO BE FIRST IN BOOKSTORES

<TEXT>
<P>
   The crowded race to publish books about the disastrous
Sydney-Hobart yacht competition of 1998 has all the critical
elements of calamity adventure _except, of course, multiple deaths.
</P>
<P>
   There are the four fiercely competitive authors: an
underfinanced Montana fly fisherman with a scrappy
David-vs.-Goliath attitude; a seasoned Australian journalist and
former weatherman with ocean racing experience; a secretive
reporter for The Wall Street Journal on leave to write a book, and
a rugged Southern Californian with a zest for kayaking and climbing
on the international endurance-sport circuit.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the nail-gnawing race: writing a riveting and
commercially successful tale of the malevolent storm that took the
lives of six sailors in the tragic December 1998 ocean-sailing
competition from Sydney, Australia, to Hobart, Tasmania.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the Australian sailing event itself, which is often
labeled the Everest of open-ocean racing, the crowded writing
competition has evolved into a contest of speed, creativity,
surprise maneuvers, high-technology, jockeying for sources and,
naturally, sniping about adventure resumes.
</P>
<P>
   The basic question, of course, is whether there is room for four
books trolling the same watery catastrophe. But the four publishers
in this case are anxiously betting that there is plenty of hunger
for calamity among couch adventurers.
</P>
<P>
   The books are following a new wave of adventure books in the
1990s that began its latest arc with the popularity of Jon
Krakauer's best-selling account of surviving the Everest disaster
of 1996, ``Into Thin Air,'' and Sebastian Junger's tale of doomed
fishermen, ``The Perfect Storm.'' And a subset among calamity books
is extreme adventure that results in disaster and death. The
Sydney-Hobart race may have a crowded field of writers, but in the
works are new manuscripts about old tragedies featuring avalanches
and multiple deaths or volcano eruptions and multiple deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first book was about adventure racing, which was strictly
adventure, but no one has ever died of that kind of racing,'' said
Martin Dugard, the Southern Californian who has just published his
account of the sailing disaster, ``Knockdown.'' ``I wanted to do a
sequel, but I actually had a publisher say that they weren't
interested unless someone dies during the race.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the developing genre of disaster writing, Dugard, himself a
regular participant in the Raid Gauloises adventure competition,
concedes that there is a thin line between the roles of ambulance
chaser and author. ``There's not much of a difference if you really
want to be brutal about it,'' he said, noting that his goal was to
be able to explain the motivations of adventurers in a thoughtful
way that might elude, for example, ``business writers.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the various writers are sporting in their praise
of each other, although there are inevitable tensions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dugard sought to interview Rob Mundle, an
Australian journalist who participated himself in the ocean race
three times and has covered the event for 30 years. Mundle was not
particularly receptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was researching my book when I got a call from a guy, who
said I've got a call from someone in America who would like to talk
to you about working with him,'' Mundle recalled. ``And I said,
`That's very nice because I'm well down that track already.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dugard said he remembered a blunter response. ``I was talking to
someone who said he would call Mundle. And then he told me, `Mundle
says he won't talk with you and he's already halfway done with his
book.' That really got my competitive juices flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rejection came again for Dugard when he tried to resume
interviews with the skipper and crew of one boat, the Sword of
Orion. ``Rob Kothe, of Orion, was very forthcoming and then the
Little, Brown guy came along,'' Dugard said. ``All of a sudden Rob
said, `I can't talk to you. Bruce has got my story.'''
</P>
<P>
   That would be G. Bruce Knecht, who covered the book publishing
industry for The Wall Street Journal before moving to its Hong Kong
bureau. He politely refuses to talk about his project because he is
still writing his book for Little, Brown &AMP; Co. He also declined to
answer questions about whether he had maneuvered sources away from
other authors.
</P>
<P>
   In the field of competitors, Little, Brown paid the highest
price for its book, reportedly spending as much as $500,000 on an
advance for Knecht. There is no scheduled date for its publication
and Little, Brown, a unit of Time Warner Inc., is content to let
Knecht come in last in the race on the assumption that he will
write a definitive book, which will draw readers with new insights
about rich business moguls risking life and expensive yachts on the
open seas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce is a very, very good writer,'' said Sarah Burnes, a
senior editor at Little, Brown. ``He's really risen and gone beyond
his journalistic writing. It seems to me that the books that are
coming out really fast are just descriptions of the story and
what's happening is that Bruce is taking the time to write a bigger
book and something that's more thoughtful.''
</P>
<P>
   But the other three publishers placed their bets on speed,
including Willow Creek Press, a small independent publisher in
Minocqua, Wis., which figured that its book, ``A Hard Chance,''
could pick up some momentum from publicity for books by larger
publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm aware this is a David and Goliath scenario,'' said Kim
Leighton, the author of ``A Hard Chance'' and a fly fishing
outfitter in Montana. ``But like Ed Psaltis, who won the race with
his seasoned crew of Midnight Rambler, I'm confident that I can win
my division.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dugard made a valiant effort to get ``Knockdown'' out first,
writing 2,000 words a day, but he was unexpectedly edged out by
Mundle's ``Fatal Storm,'' which was published in early July.
</P>
<P>
   It was sweet justice for McGraw-Hill Cos., which published
``Fatal Storm'' after failing to persuade Dugard to write its book,
said Philip Ruppel, a group publisher for McGraw-Hill, who added
that a company editor had worked with Dugard on an outline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made an offer to Marty,'' Ruppel said. ``And he got a
better offer from someone else. This is our business. It wasn't to
be.'' He said McGraw-Hill quickly started searching for a
replacement with the strategy that it could win only with crushing
speed and an early-July publication date. ``My edict was that you
have to be first or don't bother publishing,'' Ruppel said. ``I
really believe that in many ways. We wouldn't make the investment
if we were second or third because by then your book has to stand
out in every way and then your risks are much higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruppel said he decided to keep the McGraw-Hill book secret so
that other publishers would remain complacent. ``Fatal Storm'' was
first published in Australia and then McGraw-Hill bought the rights
to publish it in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But when Pocket Books learned that McGraw-Hill had the lead, the
publisher, part of Pearson PLC's Simon &AMP; Schuster unit,
counterattacked with the announcement in July that its entry,
``Knockdown,'' would be available for readers to download into
hand-held electronic books. It meant little in terms of sales,
since that market is still in its infancy, but it gave Pocket Books
a wash of publicity, including a feature in the McGraw-Hill
magazine Business Week.
</P>

<P>
   From Australia, the actual winner of the 1998 Sydney-Hobart race
is avidly following the literary competition. Psaltis is a featured
character in most of the books along with the battered crew of the
Midnight Rambler, a small yacht that eventually won the race with a
handicap for size.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised at the attention that our local race is
receiving all over the world,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ``I
suppose the tragic events have made it a news item outside of
Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   Just for the record, he is not doing his own book. However _
attention all publishers _ he has jotted down notes on the race so
he won't forget the details.

<HEADLINE>
A COMPUTER TUTOR FOR CHILDREN LEARNING TO READ 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (mk) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to eye-popping graphics, professor Jack Mostow
acknowledges, ``commercial software has our pants beat.''
</P>
<P>
   So why does he think that his recently patented software, which
is about as visually exciting as the ingredients panel on a
soup-can label, will appeal to the 60 elementary students at
Centennial Elementary in McKeesport, Pa., who are to begin using it
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It listens,'' Mostow said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the computer tutor does listen. The students, who will
be wearing headsets with microphones attached, will read aloud
short stories as the computer flashes them, sentence by sentence,
on its screen.
</P>
<P>
   If the computer hears the child stumble over a word or
mispronounce it, the computer _ which talks as well as listens _
offers a clue, such as a rhyming word that has a similar spelling.
For example, if the word is ``sight'' the computer will say and
display words like ``right'' or ``fight,'' but not dissimilar
rhymes like ``height'' or ``kite.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer tutor relies on a speech recognition system called
Sphinx II, which makes it possible for a computer to hear
continuous speech, as opposed to isolated words. Sphinx II was
developed at Carnegie Mellon University, where Mostow is a
principal research scientist and director of the university's
computer-tutor effort, Project Listen.
</P>
<P>
   The computer ``listens'' only to stories that have been recorded
into its system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project is feasible because the computer knows what the
child is attempting to read,'' Mostow said. ``That's why it's much
easier than taking voice dictation in that sense. It's harder in
the sense that there are an infinite number of ways to misread a
word.''
</P>
<P>
   The students at Centennial are participating in a study paid for
in part by the National Science Foundation that will compare
reading progress in three sets of children: those following the
standard curriculum, those helped by the computer tutor and those
receiving supplemental tutoring from human teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The computer tutor is also being used at Fort Pitt Elementary
School in Pittsburgh, where a prototype was introduced in 1996.
After eight months, six third-grade Fort Pitt students who were
problem readers _ children who in some cases, according to the
principal, could not even spell their names _ averaged more than
two years' growth in their reading skills.
</P>
<P>
   Mostow contends that the computer tutor may have advantages over
human tutors. For one, the computer tutor does not lose patience.
``The computer is quite happy to read a sentence to students as
many times as they want to hear it,'' he said. Moreover, students
who might otherwise be embarrassed by reading aloud are not
intimidated by reading to a computer. And it has dozens of rhymes
on the tip of its digital tongue.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the computer tutor catches only about half
the mistakes children make. And it is not inherently sensitive to
different manners of speech. For example, at Fort Pitt, Project
Listen had to adjust the computer tutor so that it was more
tolerant of dropped final consonants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a blurry line between reading tutoring and
pronunciation tutoring,'' Mostow said. ``When somebody is learning
how to read, what you care about is comprehension. If they
pronounce a word the same way they do in their spoken language _
that's not a reading error. It might be a dialect difference, it
might be a speech problem, but it's not a reading error.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer tutor also has multiple personalities. Its stories
and rhyming clues have been recorded in about a dozen different
voices.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, one minute a student might hear Martin Luther King Jr.'s
voice rereading a misread word. The next minute the student might
hear the computer offering words of praise in the voice of another
child.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie Mellon hopes the technology will eventually be the
basis for commercial reading software. ``In a classroom we don't
have to compete with Nintendo,'' Mostow said, ``but the home
version will probably have to have flashy graphics.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostow and Gregory Aist, a graduate student, received patent
5,920,838. More information about the program can be found on the
World Wide Web at www.cs.cmu.edu/listen.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies involved in e-commerce have achieved most-envied
status in the late 1990s business world with their riches from
initial public offerings, gaudy marketing budgets and news
clippings that laud them as pioneers of an industrial
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Given all the glamour, then, it is not a little ironic that the
most important issue facing the industry is the retail function
with the least boardroom cachet: order fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Picking, packing and shipping products was difficult enough in
recent years for Internet retailers who had no experience in such
matters. But with consumers' expectations rising and e-commerce
companies preparing to ship a wider array of merchandise to
customers this holiday season, distribution issues now loom even
larger than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is emerging as a huge issue,'' said John Hagel, who leads
the e-commerce practice for McKinsey &AMP; Co., a consulting firm.
``And it's a real bottleneck to growth. Too many companies started
with the assumption that the challenge was getting people to buy
things, when, in fact, the real challenge is getting it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm,
Web retailers will ship roughly 230 million packages this year _
mostly during the holiday season. Large companies like PlanetRx and
Etoys ship more than 1,000 packages daily, while the industry
behemoth, Amazon.com, ships more than 10,000 a day. And last week,
the research firm of Jupiter Communications predicted that the
busiest sites, including Amazon, CDNow and Barnesandnoble.com, may
each reach 58,000 transactions a day in November and December.
</P>
<P>
   That process is rife with potential pitfalls and inefficiencies.
In their infancy, most merchants simply took customers' orders, had
those orders delivered by a distributor and hoped that the items
were in stock and shipped on time to the right people. In those
days, which, in some cases, extend to today, customers could all
but count on e-mail telling them the items they had ordered were
out of stock or would be shipped late.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is starting to halt such practices. To gain customer
allegiance, Internet merchants are seeking more control over the
shipping process. In many instances, most notably in the case of
Amazon, they are building huge warehouses of their own near major
shipping hubs. But because a high-technology distribution center
can take two to three years to complete, Internet merchants are
scrambling to find third parties to handle distribution for them.
Two leaders in this category are Federated's Fingerhut Business
Services Inc. and Hanover Direct's Keystone Fulfillment Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Keystone handles fulfillment for Mercata, KBkids and Dress Barn,
while Fingerhut does the same for Wal-Mart, Levi Strauss and Etoys,
among others. Fingerhut's 1.2-million-square-foot distribution
center in Provo, Utah, will employ up to 1,200 workers during the
holiday peak, processing orders, shipping items and handling
returns.
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of many e-commerce executives, such arrangements
entail far more than simply writing a check and getting back to the
business of planning the company's initial public offering. Because
consumers are increasingly demanding so-called real time inventory,
which includes access to information about product availability and
shipping status, distribution warehouses must be closely wired to
the merchant's Web operations. Third-party distributors, however,
typically have their own electronic tracking and ordering systems,
which require painstaking efforts to link with the retailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every order, we have to pass information to their
system,'' said Louis Zambello, senior vice president of Etoys,
which recently began shipping products from Fingerhut's Utah
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The warehouse then has to pass it back to us for
confirmation,'' Zambello said. ``When the item ships, that
information goes to us for confirmation. When they get inventory in
stock, that also has to go to our system, and if you do anything
special for the customer, it has to flow from you to the
outsourcer, back to you for confirmation.''
</P>
<P>
   Integrating the retailer's computer system with the
distributor's, he said, ``takes dozens of people on both sides
working long hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambello added, ``The misconception is that outsourcing is
easier, but it's just different.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Etoys and Fingerhut would not disclose the costs
associated with building warehouses or maintaining outsourcing
relationships, Rakesh Kaul, president and chief executive of
Hanover Direct, said the costs for both options could be steep.
</P>
<P>
   Companies can expect to pay between $60 million and $80 million
to build a one-million-square-foot warehouse, Kaul said, while they
would pay a third-party distributor roughly 10 percent of each sale
to fulfill their orders. In building distribution centers of their
own, e-commerce companies ``have to bear in mind fixed costs,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like owning a 747,'' Kaul said. ``You have to be big, or
fortunate enough to fill it, because if you don't fill it and
operate all the time, you're guaranteed to lose money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel of McKinsey agreed. ``Unless you do high volume, it
doesn't make sense to build this capacity in the long run. There
are significant economies of skill and scale in these businesses,''
he said, referring to third-party distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Gaining assistance from fulfillment experts will be even more
critical, Hagel said, as e-commerce companies evolve. Not only will
Web retailers increasingly seek to sell products abroad _ an
exercise that presents logistical nightmares _ but they will also
be pushed by consumers to even greater levels of service, including
customized products.
</P>
<P>
   More immediately, though, Hagel said, Internet retailers are
complicating matters by broadening their product selection in an
effort to increase the amount spent by each customer. That means
potentially shipping multiple items from multiple points, using
different shippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand, I understand the importance of that as a way to
derive more revenue from customers,'' Hagel said. ``But on the
other hand, if these companies think they've been challenged by
fulfillment issues to date, it's nothing compared to what's
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the sudden ascendancy of fulfillment is
vindicating a segment of the business world that has long since
suffered from a lack of respect. ``We used to be those guys in the
dirty suits out there,'' said John Buck, president of Fingerhut
Business Services. ``Would you believe that fulfillment is the
darling of the day? It's actually stunning to me.''

`BESSIES' ARE AWARDED FOR DANCE AND PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A playful spirit prevailed on Friday night as Dance
Theater Workshop and the Danspace Project presented the 15th annual
New York Dance and Performance Awards at the Joyce Theater. The
awards, called the Bessies in tribute to Bessie Schoenberg, the
teacher of dance composition, celebrate achievements in dance and
performance art.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of that playful spirit was the way Ann Carlson and John
Kelly, the masters of ceremonies, kept reappearing in guises
ranging from nudity to solemn robes and Wild West gear.
</P>
<P>
   But in welcoming remarks, David White, executive director and
producer of Dance Theater Workshop, chided Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
for ``hurling dung at the Brooklyn Museum,'' a reference to the
mayor's opposition to ``Sensation,'' the museum's show of
controversial British art, which includes a Madonna adorned with
elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   The Bessies, selected by a committee, honored both specific
works of the 1998-99 season and sustained achievements over the
years. Choreographer and creator awards of $1,000 each,
underwritten by The Village Voice, went to Ping Chong and Muna
Tseng (working in collaboration), Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker,
William Forsythe and Ballett Frankfurt's Design Team (Stephen
Galloway and Naoki Takizawa), Joe Goode, Headlong Dance Theater
(David Brick, Andrew Simonet and Amy Smith), Dean Moss, Tere
O'Connor, Mary Overlie and Steve Paxton. Ms. Overlie's ``Locations
of Love'' and excerpts from Goode's ``Deeply There'' were danced.
</P>
<P>
   Performer awards of $500 each, also underwritten by The Voice,
went to Roxanne Butterfly (Samedini), Dana Caspersen, Rachel
Lynch-John, Paige Martin, Jim May and Sharon Skepple.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time an Installation and New Media Award was given
to recognize a site-specific or not easily classifiable production.
The recipient was a group called Red Dive, for a production at the
Lower East Side Tenement Museum.
</P>
<P>
   A special citation went to Point Community Development Corp. in
the Bronx for developing an art center in the Hunts Point area.
</P>
<P>
   These were other honors:
</P>
<P>
   Composer awards:
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Johnston, David Lang, James Lo and Hannibal Lokumbe.
</P>
<P>
   Lighting and visual design awards:
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wierzel, Caspar Stracke and Benton Bainbridge (in
collaboration) and the Wooster Group Design Team (James Johnson,
John Collins, Jim Findlay, Philip Bussman, Jennifer Tipton and
Elizabeth Jenyon).

J.C. PENNEY LEADS NEW FASHION SEASON WITH A SWEEPING CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Texas, Mass., Pa., Ill.) (Eds: In grafs 11 and 12, Another clothing ..., the `2' in Todd
Oldman TO2 and `Enjoy To2 Day' should be represented by the number

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the fall fashion season just starting, several retailers
and designers are introducing campaigns for their lines.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest campaigns comes from the J.C. Penney Co.,
which is seeking to reposition itself as a fashion leader. Though
spending on the campaign was not disclosed, trade publications
estimated it at $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   The new branding effort, which began last month, will include 23
commercials that were created by Temerlin McClain in Irving, Texas,
a unit of True North Communications. The spots focus on a specific
fashion or look and rely on a creative effort to illustrate it.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, one 15-second commercial begins by announcing a
look _ white button-down shirts and a variety of black stretch
pants _ and the commercial is filmed in black and white. The look
for the second spot _ for women's faux suede shirts in earthy tones
_ was filmed outdoors, emphasizing the many colors of fall.
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa Williams, the singer and actress, narrates both spots,
which are accompanied by distinctive music, and each commercial
ends with ``Look who.'' Another round of the ``Look'' commercials
presents four 15- and 30-second spots for items like fabric shoes,
hooded tops and the company's Worthington and Jacqueline Ferrar
private labels. Print, radio, Internet and direct mail campaigns,
as well as ads aimed at black and Spanish-speaking consumers, will
accompany the television blitz.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy, aimed at women ages 35 to 54, replaces a
two-year campaign with the theme ``J.C. Penney. I love your
style.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the branding effort, Penney is introducing a
separate campaign for its St. John's Bay casual clothing line aimed
at younger consumers. Though those billings were not disclosed,
trade publications estimated spending at more than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   That campaign, also by Temerlin McClain, portrays the St. John's
clothing as fitting a relaxed state of mind. Television commercials
carry the theme ``Every day's the weekend in St. John's Bay.'' The
effort will also include direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   Mossimo Inc. in Irvine, Calif., which sells clothing through
department and specialty stores, is introducing a campaign for its
casual collection geared toward a younger generation. Billings were
not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   In the campaign, which was created in collaboration between
Mossimo and Toth Brand Imaging in Concord, Mass., two-page ads have
photographs of models standing in carefree poses on open roads,
accompanied by a big signature Mossimo logo. The ads appear in
September issues of magazines including Bikini, Details, Esquire,
GQ, Spin and Rolling Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Another clothing marketer, Sun Apparel Inc. in New York, is
introducing its first campaign for its Todd Oldham TO2 line of
jeans, sportswear and accessories. Billings were estimated at more
than $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The eye-catching campaign, created by RDA International in New
York, does not resemble traditional fashion ads. A print ad uses a
busy collage of photographs, including snapshots of the designer
and models whom Oldham photographed himself, combined with a bevy
of illustrations and graphics set against a red, orange and yellow
backdrop. The ad includes the designer's signature crown logo,
along with the headline, ``Enjoy To2 day.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad appears in September issues of Seventeen, Teen People,
Interview and Mademoiselle magazines. Other components of the
campaign, which began in June with teaser ads, include posters,
postcards and a Web site at which people can design and e-mail
greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Spade, an accessory company best known for pricey handbags,
is also introducing its first campaign. Print ads, which were
created in-house, were photographed by a London-based photographer,
Tim Walker. Each photograph was meant to capture a moment that the
viewer can interpret. In one ad two brown coats _ one a man's, one
a woman's _ hang on a coat rack embracing. A red herringbone
handbag hangs over the shoulder of the woman's coat. Another ad
shows just the torso of a woman dressed conservatively in a wool
skirt, sweater and overcoat carrying a hot pink handbag. The ads
appear in the September issues of Harper's Bazaar, Vanity Fair and
Vogue. Billings were estimated just under $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth retailer, Aeropostale in New York, a unit of
MSS-Delaware Inc. that sells clothing for teen-agers, takes a
different tack for its first campaign with a 35-second cinema spot.
Billings were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The spot, created by the Chicago office of the Bozell unit of
True North, begins with a countdown leader similar to the beginning
of a movie and then opens with loud funky music and fast-paced
camera techniques that seem to bring various stills of teen-agers
clad in Aeropostale clothing to life. Male and female voice-overs
express the teen-agers' thoughts _ ``I hope I pass French'' or ``I
hope I pass calculus'' or ``I hope we pass a taco stand.'' The tag
line: ``Life can be serious. Your clothes should be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The cinema spot is running in 16 markets including Chicago, New
Jersey, New York, Philadelphia and Washington. Three print ads were
created using visuals from the cinema spot. One reads: ``I think a
lot about world hunger. I think a lot about environmental issues. I
think a lot about hair.''

`MUD', `DROWNING': AN ADVENTURE IN FOLLOWING ONE WRITER'S WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(js) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They are at once eerie and gorgeous, the gelatinous
mounds of flesh that feel the pain of rejection so deeply in the
lovely, enigmatic ``Drowning,'' a playlet by Maria Irene Fornes
that is over in the intake of a long, plaintive sigh. These exotic
creatures, animated with Wonderland-ish panache by the costume
designer Teresa Snider-Stein, look like tuskless walruses that have
evolved into bipeds.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, the childlike Pea, touchingly played by Marc Damon
Johnson, has fallen in love with the photograph of a woman in a
newspaper. The picture is a blessing, and then a curse, because the
woman is utterly repulsed when she meets Pea. His innocence
stripped away, he gets his first, corrosive lesson in how to see
himself through others' eyes, a lesson in how to detest himself.
``Is this why we have come to life?'' he asks. ``To love like this?
And hurt like this?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a simple, direct question that Ms. Fornes, a career
avant-gardist, poses in one extreme form or another in many of the
plays she has written over the last four decades, and it will be
one of the concerns explored again and again this year by the
Signature Theater Company, which is devoting its ninth season to
the works of this 69-year-old Cuban-born playwright. It will be a
true adventure for many fans of Signature's one-writer-a-season
concept, because unlike the last three honorees _ John Guare,
Arthur Miller and Sam Shepard _ Ms. Fornes has never found a
mainstream following. On an avenue of department stores, she is
forever a boutique.
</P>
<P>
   That is why she seems even more deserving of the Signature
treatment than some of her more famous colleagues: New York is,
after all, more and more a city of boutiques. And what is Signature
to do if not amplify the voices of those like Ms. Fornes, a
contemporary of trademark playwrights of the '60s and '70s like
Megan Terry and Ntozake Shange, who have a tough time getting
heard? (In earlier seasons the troupe was instrumental in
reinvigorating the reputations of Edward Albee, Horton Foote and
Adrienne Kennedy.)
</P>
<P>
   On the evidence of the first evening of her works, ``Mud'' and
``Drowning,'' both written in the 1980s, Ms. Fornes' inventive
voice, with its embrace of the surreal, will remain a marginal one.
Still, it's worth a listen, if one is willing to listen patiently.
Her plays have the meticulous composition of still lifes, which
means at times they are strikingly balanced and at others opaque,
impassive. The dialogue can be so flat, so lacking in the perfume
of real conversation, that the play could have been grown in a
hothouse, under artificial light. Anaerobic is a word that comes to
mind.
</P>
<P>
   She is perhaps best when writing in short strokes, which reveal
her clever employment of dramatic structures without lapsing into
turgidity. In the fascinating 1982 work ``The Danube,'' for
instance, she wrote a tragedy that she set in Budapest to the
rhythms and conventions of foreign-language instruction tapes. And
in her best-known play (of which you may never have heard), the
1977 ``Fefu and Her Friends,'' Ms. Fornes devised a tragicomedy
about a women's party, a kind of absurdist ``First Wives Club,'' in
which the audience picked up and moved from room to room in Fefu's
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mud'' and ``Drowning,'' which opened Sunday night in
Signature's Peter Norton Space, are given incisive productions by
the director, David Esbjornson, with meaningful assists from the
set designer, Christine Jones, and the lighting designer, Scott
Zielinski. In ``Mud,'' the longer and less interesting of the
pieces, Ms. Fornes explores the joyless existence of a small-town
woman named Mae (Deirdre O'Connell, in a performance of splendid
composure) and the brain-dead men who love, need and destroy her.
</P>
<P>
   The crumbling world in which she slaves _ the rooms of the house
may be as dank and decrepit as prison cells, but there's always a
Beckettesque pair of pants waiting for her to press _ is the
nightmare domain of martyred women everywhere. To make matters
worse, Mae suffers the attentions of Lloyd (Paul Lazar), a fetid,
dimwitted slug whom she tosses out of bed in favor of Henry (John
Seitz), whose sexual and intellectual promise dissolves as a stroke
leaves him just another useless lump for Mae to feed and clean.
Lazar's manchild and Seitz's paralytic interloper are fine
creations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mud'' is arranged in 17 scenes, each ending in a freeze, as if
they were to be posed and added to a photo album of Mae's wasted
life. ``I feel I am hollow and offensive,'' she says, invoking the
language of the victim. We know in Ms. O'Connell's moving
countenance that Mae gets exactly what she doesn't deserve.
</P>
<P>
   The male grotesques of ``Drowning'' are even less well equipped
than Mae to weather everyday brutality; their nerves are as exposed
as their oily, splotchy skin, which undulates in massive folds
around their jaws and shoulders. Johnson's Pea and Philip Goodwin's
gently avuncular Roe share a table at a European cafe, as Pea
relates in three short takes the before-and-after of his
infatuation with the woman in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The playlet is almost over by the time you recover from the
weird effect of the actors' swollen appearances, but Johnson is
nonetheless disconcertingly affecting in the instant of Pea's
discovery of heartache. One leaves the theater wondering where and
when Ms. Fornes might next supply such a disturbing moment of
emotional clarity.

 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Malcolm Cowley once said that the motto of The Paris
Review could be ``enterprise in the service of art.'' Other
literary journals have been founded and then have foundered, but
the Left Bank quarterly created by several hopeful young American
writers has remained a vital part of the literary scene after more
than 45 years of operation. In the case of The Paris Review,
persistence and intellectual acumen (and an instinct for survival)
have paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of Peter Matthiessen, Harold L. Humes,
George Plimpton (its longtime editor) and others, The Review has
discovered new writers, publishing early stories of Philip Roth as
well as fiction by Terry Southern, Nadine Gordimer, V.S. Naipaul
and Richard Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally the editors made mistakes. John Irving's story
``The Pension Grillparzer'' was rejected by one of Plimpton's
colleagues with a curt note saying the author ``fails to do
anything with language or form.'' The story became a pivotal part
of Irving's novel ``The World According to Garp.'' As Plimpton
recalled: ``We posted that reply on the bulletin board. It sat
there for years as a warning, because that's a perfect short
story.''
</P>
<P>
   In probably its most significant claim to a legacy, The Review
has persuaded major authors to sit for portraits in extensive
interviews in the ``Writers at Work'' series, whose subjects
include figures like Eliot and Pound, Cocteau and Celine, Faulkner
and Hemingway, Mauriac, Moravia, Simenon, Saul Bellow, Paul Bowles,
Norman Mailer, Eudora Welty and Marianne Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a step into posterity, the archives of The Review have
been acquired by the Pierpont Morgan Library. This vast collection
includes letters to and from authors (one of them is the note
rejecting ``The Pension Grillparzer''), manuscripts, original
versions of interviews, editorial and business records, photographs
and ``common books'' with memos and musings from various editors.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, which is to be announced this week by Charles
E. Pierce Jr., the director of the Morgan, was made with the
financial help of an unnamed ``mutual friend'' of the library and
The Review. The price was estimated to be in excess of $500,000.
Plimpton said the money would go to a foundation to help the
magazine continue publication.
</P>
<P>
   In the collection are 100 boxes with more than 200,000 pages of
text.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before being moved to the Morgan, the papers filled the basement
of Plimpton's Manhattan brownstone. During the next year the
archives will be cataloged and then made available to scholars and
will be a primary source for anyone attempting to write a history
of The Paris Review.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the archives, Pierce said: ``To have such a
treasure trove from the end of this century is really an
extraordinary opportunity. It extends the range of our 20th-century
collection,'' which also includes the voluminous collection of
contemporary books from the estate of Carter Burden, the
businessman and philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Paris Review was created in 1953, partly in reaction to
other literary magazines. The goal was to de-emphasize criticism
and to focus on original works of fiction and poetry and on writers
talking about the craft of writing. In the early 1970s the magazine
moved its offices to Manhattan, with Plimpton continuing as the
quarterly's editor and primary promoter. Over the years he has
enlisted backers from Sadruddin Aga Khan (the first publisher) to
Hugh Hefner. Often he has helped sustain The Review by sponsoring
benefit social events.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary exploration of the archives reveals the intricate
inner workings of the magazine, the difficulties of dealing with
artistic temperaments and financial crises, and the quest above all
to make a distinctive cultural contribution. The Review seems to
have improvised its way into longevity. Running through the papers
is the motif of money. Repeatedly writers ask: When am I going to
be paid? When will that story or interview appear? Will it ever
appear?
</P>
<P>
   In correspondence Roth revealed his impatience with the slow
pace of editorial decisions. In one letter he said, ``By the way,
what finally did you people decide about `Goodbye Columbus'?'' Then
when that story was accepted, he wrote, ``I understand the price is
either two or three hundred: I vote for three.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The interviews began in 1952 with E.M. Forster, whom Plimpton
knew from his days as a graduate student at Cambridge University.
After Forster appeared in the first issue, the conversations came
to be considered a certification of an author's importance. There
have been more than 250 of them, many reprinted in a series of
books.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some authors made special demands. Nabokov supposedly was the
only one who was paid for his participation. The editorial
explanation of that payment ($500) was that, in his case, the
interview was conducted entirely by mail, with Nabokov writing his
answers. Because the interviews began before the general use of
tape recorders, an author would often be visited by two people, who
would alternate between asking questions and transcribing answers.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning the talks were intended to be collaborations
rather than inquisitions, Plimpton said. The authors were
encouraged to edit the transcripts and rewrite their answers. Then
editors would make additional suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Faulkner requesting an interview, Humes said that
one purpose was for the ``Old China Hands'' of literature to
explain their conjuring tricks to younger writers. He added that if
Faulkner agreed, he would have the ``final authority to pass on
every word of the finished interview before publication.''
</P>
<P>
   After reading his interview, Mailer penciled in several pages of
questions and answers. Graham Greene was the only one to refuse to
have the conversation reprinted in a book. In a neatly typed letter
signed ``Yours Jack,'' Kerouac said he had edited out ``all the
vulgarities and racial name-callings, after all when you're yakking
in private with friends it's not necessarily what you would say in
public print, in such heated boozy terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the authorized quality of the interviews, many writers
were quite outspoken, and several of the colloquies have become
classic: Hemingway in conversation with Plimpton, Robert Penn
Warren's interview by another eminent writer, Ralph Ellison (along
with Eugene Walter). In a candid talk with Jean Stein, Faulkner
said: ``The writer's only responsibility is to his art. ...
Everything goes by the board: honor, pride, decency, security,
happiness, all, to get the book written. If a writer has to rob his
mother, he will not hesitate; the `Ode on a Grecian Urn' is worth
any number of old ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   At first Hemingway expressed a hesitation because, he said, he
could not speak about his writing as Forster, Greene and Irwin Shaw
did. He wrote in longhand to Plimpton: ``My experience has been
that when a writer talks about himself and his work except with his
girl or other writers or to try to straighten kids out with what
you know that can help them he is usually ... a poseur or a more or
less pompous ass.''
</P>
<P>
   An answer in one interview might provoke a question in another,
as in this one to Nabokov: ``E.M. Forster says his characters
sometimes take over and dictate the course of his novels. Has this
ever been a problem for you, or are you in complete command?''
Nabokov said haughtily, ``My knowledge of Forster's work is limited
to one novel which I dislike,'' and in contrast, ``My characters
are galley slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all authors have been eager to be questioned. Naturally,
both J.D. Salinger and Thomas Pynchon, the mystery men of American
letters, refused. Salinger replied with a note striking a
Bartleby-like stance of ``I prefer not to.'' Eventually The Review
ran a piece about a journalist's aborted attempt to talk to
Salinger.
</P>
<P>
   Plimpton has always hoped that Pynchon would relent, banking on
the author's goodwill because Plimpton reviewed his novel ``V''
favorably in The New York Times Book Review. Also eluding The Paris
Review are Harper Lee and Anne Tyler, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Hall, who was the first poetry editor of The Review,
interviewed Eliot and Pound and often came up with new ideas for
subjects. Apparently he was one of several in pursuit of Salinger.
When Hall was living in New Hampshire, he wrote to Plimpton: ``For
the next 10 weeks, I will spend two afternoons each week in
Hanover, where old Jerry reputedly comes shopping from time to
time. I will try to catch him shoplifting, or whatever it takes, in
order to blackmail him into an interview.''
</P>
<P>
   One literary battle occurred after Stephen Spender wrote a piece
recounting episodes involving Hemingway and Laura Riding. In a
heated essay, Martha Gellhorn, Hemingway's former wife, challenged
Spender's memory and then upbraided Lillian Hellman for passing off
fiction as fact. In one of many letters to Plimpton, Gellhorn said
that her marriage to Hemingway broke up on the ``jagged rock'' of
``apocryphism,'' adding, ``Miss Hellman has his worst
characteristics without his talent or his charm, when he happened
to be charming.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Browsing through the archives at the Morgan on a recent morning,
Plimpton grew nostalgic for Paris in the '50s. He remembered his
first sighting of Hemingway, buying a copy of the second issue of
The Paris Review in a bookstall at the Ritz Hotel. He recalled that
when he and his associates were searching for material, they
canvassed cafes for sketches left by artists as payment for meals.
They found drawings by Picasso, Braque, Matisse, Lautrec and also
Chaplin and Jacques Tati, and reprinted them in The Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very rich time over there,'' he said. ``Paris was a
ripe place _ and the right place _ to start a magazine.''

FOUNDER OF YEAR 2000 SERVICE QUITS TO TRY DIFFERENT APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)  (mk) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying that people are losing interest in efforts to organize
neighborhoods and communities for potential Year 2000 computer
threats, the co-founder of an Internet-based clearinghouse for such
grass-roots activities has resigned as the service's research
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to have hit a wall,'' said Paloma O'Riley, who
co-founded the clearinghouse, the Cassandra Project, in June of
1997. Her activism brought invitations to testify before Congress
and made her a leader in the pursuit of grass-roots responses to
potential Year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are developing a false sense of security,'' she said
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Far from abandoning Year 2000 work, though, Ms. O'Riley said she
was leaving Cassandra to press public officials to prepare more
aggressively for possible disasters. Her new focus on political
advocacy might have jeopardized Cassandra's tax-exempt status had
she stayed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cassandra (www.cassandraproject.org) will continue under
Catherine Moyer, a Denver-based database designer who co-founded
the group and had already assumed much of the public-appearance
responsibilities from Ms. O'Riley in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The clearinghouse is being redesigned to focus more on specific
areas of concern, including preparations at mental health centers
and environmental threats from Year 2000 problems, Ms. Moyer said.
The site lists several hundred Year 2000 community groups in the
United States and overseas, but no one is sure how many are active.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Riley said advocates of individual and community
preparedness had been undermined by the steadily increasing
drumbeat of optimistic news about the nation's readiness for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The final blow, she said, was the recent assertion by the
Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, that there was a
``negligible'' chance of widespread disruption of banks and other
key institutions in the United States. Greenspan warned that fear
of Year 2000 disruptions was more likely to hurt the economy than
was the computer problem itself, especially if people emptied
grocery store shelves and bank accounts in anticipation of
widespread disasters when computers failed to recognize ``00'' as
2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the current atmosphere, Ms. O'Riley said, even those
officials who believe that it makes sense to prepare for
disruptions like loss of power, phones or water are afraid they
will be stymied and exposed to ridicule if they act on those
beliefs. To counter the inertia, Ms. O'Riley is hoping to come up
with ways to make local officials believe that they could face
legal or financial liabilities if their failure to act results in
breakdowns in local services or public safety.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Davis, a former computer manager for Montgomery
County, Md., who frequently works with community-based Year 2000
programs, said: ``Threatening to hold government officials
accountable is a tough way to get them to act. I wish her luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Riley, a 44-year-old New York native, became a believer in
the value of self-sufficiency while living in rural Alaska with her
husband and two sons in the 1980s. She first encountered Year 2000
computer issues as a computer security officer at a naval Hospital
in 1990 during the war in the Persian Gulf. A stint as the Year
2000 project manager for Rover Group Ltd. in England several years
later convinced her that disruptions could be global and
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Riley decided to leave Rover and concentrate on raising
public awareness of the potential Year 2000 threat. She and her
husband, Kevin, chose Colorado as their base of operations. O'Riley
is a mechanical engineer at Maxtor Corp., a maker of computer hard
drives in Longmont, Colo., and is active in that company's Year
2000 program.

   &UR; - Mark Allen Levinson &LR;  of Alain Pinel Realtors is asking $18
million, the highest asking price for any residence ever in San

   But another cab-driver correspondent says that he would never
think of using hotel bathrooms, which he considers as ``private and

stations.'' And a third offers his own solution: a bicycle water
bottle, after which the liquid is dumped into the street (and the
stench is blamed on the homeless).

   Meanwhile, the New York Observer reports on an experimental
police program in which public urinators in midtown Manhattan are
required to take part in meetings of a ``quality of life group,''
in which the consequences and meaning of the act are discussed.
According to the Observer, ``Each urinator was asked to explain
what led them to do what they did _ too much beer, too little
discipline was the short answer _ and then to probe the real root
cause of their offense.'' They all agreed it was a bad habit picked
up in childhood.

<P>
   According to a preview in Los Angeles magazine, Anketell says
that supermodel  &UR; Naomi Campbell &LR;  threatened one year that she
wouldn't walk the runway in a fashion show if her entire entourage
was not admitted free. And the head of a European fashion firm
asked if Anketell could set him up with movie chief

`WHY THEY KILL': A FRIGHTENING NEW LOOK AT THE ROOTS OF VIOLENCE  
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(js) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news that Richard Rhodes brings in his fascinating new book,
``Why They Kill: The Discoveries of a Maverick Criminologist,''
does not seem particularly arresting at first. ``Not poverty or
genetic inheritance or psychopathology ... is the cause of criminal
violence,'' Rhodes sums up midway through his book. It is instead
conditioning that trains people to maim and kill.
</P>
<P>
   Ho-hum, you respond. So it is back to nurture prevailing over
nature, and all the tiresome arguments over the death penalty and
society's responsibility for producing killers. Moreover, you
suspect Rhodes of special pleading. Because both he and Dr. Lonnie
H. Athens, the sociologist he writes about, were victims of violent
abuse as children, you suspect the two of generalizing from their
own experiences. You even smell over-identification when Rhodes
writes of President John F. Kennedy's assassin: ``We are culpable
for these killers. A hand extended to that happy, bright,
observant, pleasant child might have spared us Lee Harvey Oswald's
terrible swift sword.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet once you get into the details of ``Why They Kill,'' you find
yourself both surprised by some of its conclusions and mesmerized
by its narrative. The book is not so much a summing up of the
theories of Athens as maverick criminologist as an account of his
stormy voyage of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins with Athens' own violent childhood in Richmond:
how he was beaten and terrorized by his brawling Greek-peasant
father until he learned to fight back and menace his own
contemporaries. But he was bright and inquisitive. He began to
think about violence, and he took up the study of sociology when
against all odds, considering his unstable background and crude
demeanor, he got to college and went on to graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   At first he was enamored of statistics and the quantitative
school of sociology. But with a teaching assistantship at the
University of Wisconsin he fell under the influence of the
qualitatively oriented Chicago School, which held that people,
unlike atoms and molecules, found meaning in their experiences and
that social phenomena could not be measured.
</P>
<P>
   He was led to go beyond statistics, to interview violent
criminals and ask them what they thought about and experienced when
they committed their violent acts. Surprisingly, he learned that
they invariably made plans to commit violence, decided consciously
to act and felt wholly responsible for what they had done. This was
consistent with his childhood observations that violent people
rarely seemed crazy (on the contrary, crazy people were
nonviolent), and contradicted the prevailing theories that
murderers killed in bursts of unconsciously motivated passion and
in spite of themselves. These discoveries went into his first book,
``Violent Criminal Acts and Actors.''
</P>
<P>
   His next project was to work out how violent people got that
way, in particular why so many of his subjects seemed once to have
been frightened children. Through further interviews with hard-core
criminals, he defined a process he called ``violentization.'' He
theorized that this broke down into stages he named
``brutalization,'' ``belligerency,'' ``violent performances'' and
``virulency,'' the last of which was often highly satisfying to the
individual committing violence. This formed the material for his
second book, ``The Creation of Dangerous Violent Criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Athens' work apparently won him few rewards, writes Rhodes,
whose best-known books are ``The Making of the Atomic Bomb'' and
``Dark Sun.'' The dissonance of his ideas combined with his
unpolished conduct cost him tenure on his first teaching job. His
academic career then foundered and wallowed for years until he
eventually washed up at Seton Hall University, where Rhodes
discovered him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why They Kill'' details his theories in compelling detail,
applies them to well-known figures like Mike Tyson and Lee Harvey
Oswald, among others, examines them in the perspective of history,
and asks how the process they describe might be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   You find yourself skeptical at moments. Athens' theory is
over-schematic in places, particularly for a description of
emotions. Its terminology can be clunky: ``violentization'';
``frustrative-malefic'' (the fourth and most extreme type of
criminal orientation to reality), and ``personal horrification''
(``the second component of brutalization''). You wonder about the
variety of his evidence, whether his theory really embraces a
complete enough range of criminal types. And you find it depressing
to learn that the process of violentization, once completed, seems
irreversible, an argument in favor of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Rhodes' summary the theory offers a commanding
perspective on human violence. It provides a coherent explanation
of human development, one that can be seen to dovetail with both
psychoanalysis and anthropology. Wherever you look, it explains
things. It surprises you not unpleasantly with its promise that
``violentization has nothing to do with race _ or with poverty, for
that matter.'' And it makes a lot of useful if scary sense.
</P>
<P>
   As Rhodes concludes: ``One prejudice that has comforted us is
that violent criminals are categorically different from the rest of
us _ mentally ill, or brain damaged, or monstrous, or anomic, or
genetically or subculturally determined. Lonnie Athens demonstrates
to the contrary that violent people come to their violence by the
same universal processes ... that carry the rest of us to
conformity, pacifism, greatness, eccentricity or sainthood _ and
bear equal responsibility for their choices.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Rhodes has combined biography, theory and intellectual
history makes his presentation irresistible.

RIVAL BID FOR NATWEST EXPECTED IN BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A bidding war appears to be under way in British
banking, with Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC said to be preparing
a competing offer for National Westminster Bank PLC.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, expected as soon as Monday, according to executives
briefed on the plan, would be worth about 25 billion pounds, or $41
billion _ nearly $7 billion more than the hostile bid for Natwest
announced on Friday by Bank of Scotland PLC.
</P>
<P>
   National Westminster had quickly rejected Bank of Scotland's
offer, which was valued at 20.85 pounds, or more than $34 billion,
based on Thursday's closing stock market prices. It said in a
statement that ``the offer undervalues Natwest Group, is
unsolicited, unwelcome and ill-thought-out.''
</P>
<P>
   Natwest officials had no comment Sunday on word that a larger
offer from Royal Bank might be imminent. Officials at Royal Bank of
Scotland could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Natwest, which had been in the midst of a proposed $17.2 billion
acquisition of Legal and General Group, a big British insurer, has
temporarily postponed a vote on that deal, which had been scheduled
for Oct. 6. Bank of Scotland's offer was contingent on Natwest's
abandoning that acquisition. Royal Bank is said to be considering
imposing a similar condition.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, investors and analysts had anticipated that other
suitors might emerge, sending shares of Natwest up 29 percent, to
13.54 pounds. At the time, Royal Bank of Scotland, Abbey National
PLC and Halifax PLC were the names being mentioned in financial
circles here as possible new bidders for Natwest, which is larger
than any of them _ as well as being twice the size of Bank of
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   These banks are assumed to be on a short list of banking
companies that regulators might allow to acquire Natwest. Other big
banks, like HSBC Holdings PLC, along with Barclays and Lloyds TSB,
would most likely be deemed to big to be allowed to acquire
Natwest, which is Britain's third-largest bank, with $235.9 billion
in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Although some analysts said that Abbey National and Halifax were
probably too small to acquire Natwest, a British Sunday paper, The
Observer, reported Sunday that Abbey National was preparing its own
bid for Natwest. Abbey National officials could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   A Natwest takeover by either Bank of Scotland, which has $95.7
billion in assets, or Royal Bank, with assets of more than $134
billion, would create Britain's second-largest banking company.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the deal said that Royal Bank of Scotland
had retained Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs to draw up a plan for
a counteroffer. Bank of Scotland is being represented by Gleacher &AMP;
Co., which Natwest had owned for three years before selling it back
in April to Eric Gleacher and its other principals. It is also
being advised by Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. Natwest has hired J.P. Morgan and Dresdner Bank.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The emergence of the two Scottish banks as rival bidders is
somewhat novel. Earlier this month, executives from the two
companies had discussed the possibility of making a joint bid for
Natwest, according to people close to the discussions. The Sunday
Telegraph reported that the talks broke down because both banks
would have had to divest too many assets to placate regulators. A
spokesman at Bank of Scotland declined to comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predicted that a showdown between Bank of Scotland and
Royal Bank of Scotland would be simply the beginning of
consolidation in the British banking industry, after a spate of
mergers and acquisitions that have already taken place among banks
on the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure for consolidation has been building up for some
time,'' said John Tyce, an analyst with SG Securities in London.
</P>
<P>
   Of Bank of Scotland's attempt to acquire Natwest, even with a
hostile bid, he said, ``They definitely are pushing on an open
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Natwest itself may have created that opening with its plan to
buy the insurer Legal and General in an effort to expand its
position in financial services while remaining independent.
Analysts and investors have bitterly complained that Natwest was
paying too much for the company. Its stock tumbled 9 percent in
three days after it said on Sept. 5 that it would pay 2.10 pounds a
share for Legal and General, a 20 percent premium over the stock's
price the day before Natwest made its announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of Scotland and now Royal Bank of Scotland are hoping to
take advantage of unhappiness among Natwest stockholders by
offering an alternative strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very opportunistic,'' Tyce said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to forcing Natwest to abandon its acquisition of
Legal and General as a condition of its own acquisition, Bank of
Scotland said it planned to sell or spin off noncore assets and
reduce Natwest's work force of 64,400. Royal Bank of Scotland is
also planning cuts, executives close to the deal said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Natwest would be more receptive to a higher bid by Royal
Bank is uncertain. But in rejecting Bank of Scotland's offer,
Natwest had criticized not only the price but also the plan to
reduce the staff and sell assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natwest has a vision of growth in financial services,''
Natwest's chairman, Sir David Rowland, said in a statement released
on Friday, ``with an expanding range of products to develop across
its 6.5 million customer base and its position as the U.K.'s
leading business bank. This should be contrasted with Bank of
Scotland's plans for asset sales, branch closures and footprint
reductions.''

AT&AMP;T FACES ITS SPINOFF AS A RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, AT&AMP;T Corp. spun off its communications
equipment operation as Lucent Technologies Inc. in an attempt to
remove the crippling conflict among the equipment business and
AT&AMP;T's communications units.
</P>
<P>
   The move was a big success, almost certainly the most trenchant
that Robert E. Allen made as AT&AMP;T's chairman. Lucent, as an
independent equipment company, has gotten new business from
customers, including the Bell local phone operations, that had
grown wary of helping subsidize AT&AMP;T's telephone operation.
</P>
<P>
   But now, for the first time since the spinoff, AT&AMP;T and Lucent
may find themselves in conflict again, this time in the hot market
for communications consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the companies, who still sometimes speak of one
another as if they were in the same corporate family, could still
make a deal to keep everyone happy. But with Lucent and AT&AMP;T each
building consulting operations geared toward corporate clients and
with contracts potentially worth billions on the table, such an
accord could require exquisite diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   The looming conflict was precipitated by Lucent's $3.7 billion
deal in August to acquire International Network Services Inc., a
sort of temp agency for high-powered network engineers. Since being
spun off from AT&AMP;T, Lucent has worked closely with its former
parent in a variety of ways. But Lucent intends to use the
International Network deal to bolster its Netcare consulting
operation. John L. Drew, chief executive of International Network,
is to lead the Netcare unit.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years AT&AMP;T has built its own AT&AMP;T Solutions
consulting and outsourcing operation into a multibillion-dollar
business. Moreover, AT&AMP;T has long relied on International Network
to supply engineers and networking experts for many of the big AT&AMP;T
corporate clients that may now become targets for Lucent Netcare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very substantial relationship with INS as a supplier
to us, a key supplier to us, in working with us on a number of
engagements for major clients,'' said Jim Byrnes, an AT&AMP;T Solutions
spokesman, declining to comment further on the potential conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T Solutions and Lucent Netcare operations do not appear
to overlap completely, but the companies' public statements alone
make it clear that the two units are approaching the same market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designing, building and managing global networks,'' reads the
headline on AT&AMP;T Solutions' Web site. ``That's what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the news release announcing Lucent's deal for International
Network, Drew said, ``Our combined companies will offer customers a
level of service in designing, integrating and managing
next-generation networks that is simply unmatched.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the companies said that AT&AMP;T and Lucent
would probably strike a deal to give AT&AMP;T continued access to
International Network personnel. In exchange, it seems likely that
Lucent would want to become some sort of preferential equipment
supplier to AT&AMP;T Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always partnered with AT&AMP;T Solutions, and when we
acquire INS, that will continue,'' said Kathy Fitzgerald, a Lucent
spokeswoman, declining to comment specifically on how such an
arrangement could be structured.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card, however, is Cisco Systems Inc., the data
communications equipment giant that is Lucent's rival. AT&AMP;T does a
lot of business with both Lucent and Cisco, which could make it
tricky for AT&AMP;T to make a side deal with Lucent.

increase as far north as New York as onshore winds along the East
Coast direct more humid air inland. Rainfall in excess of 2 inches
is possible from Florida to the Carolinas. During the weekend,
Melbourne, Fla., received nearly 8 inches of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Northeast will stay bright and warm as a result of
high pressure centered just east of New England. Readings may reach
80 degrees in the valleys of northern Vermont. Clouds will arrive
later in the day, but rain is not expected before Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A chilly rain will follow the passage of a cold front from the
central Great Lakes to the Texas panhandle. Temperatures will be as
much as 30 degrees lower behind the front. Colder breezes from the
north will drive the very cool weather down along the east slopes
of the Rockies. Showers will be mixed with snow in the higher
foothills of Colorado and in some valley locations of central
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure crested near Vancouver will control the weather
over the western third of the nation. The clockwise circulation
around the fair weather system will take the very cool, dry air
from the interior and carry it to the northwest coast. Increasing
offshore winds in California will promote sunny, very warm
conditions in the northern sections. Weaker winds in southern
California will allow coastal clouds to linger for a few hours in
the morning.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Dry Bayou
</P>
<P>
   Except for the edges of the Gulf Coast _ that is, south Texas
and the Everglades _ it has been a very quiet season for tropical
storms in this region. The effect is being noticed most in
Louisiana where yearly precipitation deficits have mounted to more
than 10 inches from New Orleans to Lake Charles. In fact, this
month has brought Lake Charles only 1.38 inches or slightly more
than 25 percent of normal September rainfall. Much of the late
summer and autumn rainfall is attributed to tropical moisture, but
a robust Bermuda high has steered this year's storms toward the
Atlantic seaboard instead.

AFTERSHOCK IN TAIWAN KILLS 3, TOPPLES WEAKENED BUILDINGS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TOKYO _ Taiwan suffered a major aftershock on Sunday that killed
at least three people and injured 58 others, destroyed buildings
and roads already weakened from last week's devastating earthquake,
and sent thousands of horrified residents scurrying for safety.
</P>
<P>
   The aftershock, which measured 6.8, hit at 7:52 a.m. and was
centered about 6 miles east of Sun Moon Lake in Nantou county. This
mountainous region in the middle of the island was the epicenter of
last week's 7.6-magnitude quake, which killed more than 2,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   Local radio and television reports from Taiwan said the
10-second aftershock set off numerous landslides across the
country. At least three motorists died when their cars were buried
on a road in central Yulin county. There were unconfirmed reports
that two children riding with their parents had died on the same
road.
</P>
<P>
   The news reports said people across the island fled buildings in
a panic Sunday morning, many wearing motorcycle helmets and some
only their underwear.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-story apartment complex, already damaged, collapsed on a
busy road in the city of Nantou, and a nearby office building
exploded and burst into flames, the reports said. The 40 apartments
of the complex were evacuated after the quake on Sept. 21, but many
residents had returned recently to gather possessions. It could not
be learned if anyone was hurt in the two buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the injured were rescue workers who were struck by
falling debris in Nantou and Taichung counties, near the epicenter.
Eleven people were hurt by flying glass and other debris in a rice
wine distillery in the town of Puli.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the death and destruction, there were tales of heroic
rescues, even as many Taiwanese had given up hope of finding
survivors beneath the tons of steel and concrete rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Two brothers were rescued on Sunday after being trapped for five
days in a collapsed high-rise building in Taipei. Sun Chiu-kuang,
20, and Sun Chui-feng, 25, survived by eating rotten apples from a
refrigerator buried with them and drinking their own urine and
water sprayed on the rubble by rescue workers, Taipei city
officials said. The officials said the brothers' father had told
them that he had ``been waiting for this moment and that he hadn't
slept since the initial earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, President Lee Teng-hui declared a six-month state
of emergency, giving the military increased powers to maintain
order and imposing severe sentences for overcharging consumers for
basic necessities that have become scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's government has come under sharp criticism for being slow
to respond to the earthquake, which destroyed vital highways and
bridges. Many towns and villages could not be reached by rescuers,
who were also hampered by inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 people remain homeless, and many cities,
including parts of the capital, are without electricity, as the
earthquake and its aftershocks caused severe damage to power
generating plants and substations.
</P>
<P>
   In Taiwan's third largest city, Taichung, thousands of residents
have been sleeping outdoors, fearing aftershocks. In a telephone
interview, one resident, Khu Mu-hsiang, said Sunday that his family
and neighbors were afraid to return to their high-rise apartment
complex and that they planned to continue sleeping in tents in the
elementary school playground across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that we are literally petrified and on edge all
the time,'' he said. ``Each time the ground moves, we keep
wondering when it will stop and if this is finally `the big one.'''
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,300 aftershocks have hit Taiwan since last Tuesday's
earthquake, an average of almost one a minute. Eight of the jolts
measured six or above and have been classified as major quakes in
their own right.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Taiwan's Seismology Center said they expected
aftershocks to continue for several months and that further quakes
of 6.8 magnitude are possible. Taiwan straddles a major fault line
on the western edge of the Pacific ``rim of fire'' and has dozens
of tremors each year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More than 1,000 buildings, mainly high-rise apartment complexes,
have collapsed since the quake last week, and about 5,400 buildings
have been damaged severely, raising concerns that many were not
built according to government codes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government announced a nationwide investigation,
with the help of hundreds of prosecutors, engineers and architects,
to determine if contractors had violated building codes.
</P>
<P>
   Two building contractors have already been arrested, and 16 more
have been prevented from leaving the island. In one case,
investigators found that the support pillars of several collapsed
buildings had been made of concrete that was poured around empty
oil cans, creating huge air bubbles inside that caused the concrete
to collapse in the quake.
</P>
<P>
   American rescue workers who came to Taiwan to assist in the
recovery effort told The Associated Press that they saw similar
corner-cutting just last month in cheap Turkish buildings that used
salty sea sand in concrete. Many of those structures collapsed
during the quake on Aug. 17 that killed more than 15,000 people in
Turkey.

GM AND UAW HOPE TO REACH PACT THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors and the United Automobile Workers union
hope to reach a new, four-year labor contract within the next
several days, as the relationship between the world's largest
company and its main union appears to have improved considerably
since last year's 54-day strike in Flint, Mich., auto industry and
union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for the two sides worked through the weekend to mold
an agreement similar to that concluded by the union with
DaimlerChrysler AG on Sept. 16. DaimlerChrysler workers voted on
that agreement on Saturday. While the vote count is not scheduled
for release until Monday, local union officials predicted that the
pact would be easily ratified.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW's previous, three-year agreement with GM,
DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor Co. expired on Sept. 14, but the
union has agreed to keep workers on the job while it negotiates
with each company. A GM official close to the talks said Sunday,
``They're making progress, they met until very late last night.''
</P>
<P>
   The UAW agreement with DaimlerChrysler and a pact by the
Canadian Auto Workers union with Ford last Tuesday both call for
wage increases that exceed the inflation rate by nearly 3 percent,
plus a wide range of benefits. The UAW contract also limits how
quickly DaimlerChrysler can shrink its work force through
attrition, a provision that might cause some difficulties for GM.
</P>
<P>
   If GM accepts an identical provision, it could continue
downsizing but with some limits on how quickly it does so. Another
issue in the talks involves the extent to which workers at GM's
former auto parts division, which it spun off in May, will be able
to return to job openings at GM.
</P>
<P>
   Labor relations between GM and the UAW have improved since last
year's strike for several reasons. GM appears to have suffered a
small but permanent loss of market share because of the strike,
making neither the company nor the union eager to repeat the
experience. The American auto market is booming, leaving every
automaker straining to keep up with production and autoworkers
reluctant to risk their profit-sharing checks on another walkout.
And GM has completely revamped its approach to labor negotiations
since last year.
</P>
<P>
   GM strongly criticized union leaders during last year's strike,
in an unsuccessful bid to persuade employees that the work stoppage
was a mistake. After the strike, GM brought home a quiet-spoken
American executive, Gary Cowger, who had been running GM's German
subsidiary, and gave him unusually broad authority as group vice
president for labor relations. His predecessor, Gerald Knechtel,
had been only a vice president, and had less authority.
</P>
<P>
   Cowger, who likes to talk about his grandchildren and who spent
the first 13 years of his career working his way up through
supervisory positions at a GM assembly plant in Kansas City, Kan.,
has gotten along very well with UAW leaders, said a union official
who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A deal with the UAW would not guarantee a strike-free autumn for
GM. It must still reach an agreement with the Canadian Auto Workers
union. The Canadian union wants GM and DaimlerChrysler to sign
contracts in Canada similar to Ford's. The Canadian union announced
Sunday afternoon that it would negotiate a new labor contract with
DaimlerChrysler next, leaving talks with GM for last.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scott Sprinzen, the managing director for auto industry credit
ratings at Standard &AMP; Poor's, said that a peaceful labor settlement
between GM and the UAW would be welcome on Wall Street. Standard &AMP;
Poor's currently assigns a single-A rating to GM's long-term
credit, but because of the potential for labor unrest, the rating
comes with a ``negative outlook,'' which means that it may be
downgraded.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they reach an agreement in the U.S. and Canada, we could
well take a look at that negative outlook,'' Sprinzen said. Any
improvement in GM's credit rating would save the company money by
allowing it to borrow money at lower interest rates.

CALIFORNIA CONDORS LEARNING WHAT IT MEANS TO BE WILD 
</HEADLINE>

now  RELEASED  for use and is being  REPEATED  for all needing.)

 By BARBARA WHITAKER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN CLUB, Calif. _ Perched on a roof in this small
wilderness community, California condor W0 is a sight to behold.
Weighing in at about 20 pounds, with a wingspan around 9 feet and
history going back to the time of the mastodon, his presence is
awe-inspiring. But Mike Barth, a wildlife biologist, would rather
he just went away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to flush him,'' said Barth, a supervisory
biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, after examining
the bird with binoculars and watching it for about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Before he got the chance, however, W0 obligingly lifted off and
sailed across the valley to his cohorts resting on dead trees
across the way. But chances are he will be back.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the free-flying condors released in California
seem to have taken a shine to this retreat in the San Emigdio
Mountains about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles. They have been
visiting regularly over the last month, confounding wildlife
officials, captivating residents and creating mischief by ripping
up deck furniture, doormats and, in one case, tearing through a
screen and into a bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Once threatened with extinction, the condors are part of a group
born in captivity after their dwindling numbers led officials to
capture the last of the California condors in 1987. At that time,
there were only 27 California condors in existence.
</P>
<P>
   So successful was the breeding program that officials began
reintroducing them to the wild in 1992. There are now 162
California condors, with 113 in captivity, 29 flying free in
California and 20 more in Arizona near the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   While the condors have shown up in communities before, never
have there been so many that have been so persistent in their
presence in one area. One day this month, 15 condors showed up on a
Pine Mountain Club roof, and they have continued to visit,
generally in lesser numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The new boldness has led to concerns and ultimately some debate
about how to address the situation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologists move the birds along by waving
their arms or lobbing pine cones in their direction, and community
meetings have been held in many areas to encourage residents to do
the same. But some residents object to running the birds off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made my property off limits to fish and wildlife officials
because I don't like them harassing the birds,'' said Les Reid, a
former board member of the Sierra Club, who lives in Pine Mountain
Club. ``As far as I'm concerned they should leave the birds alone.
They're a great addition to our community.''
</P>
<P>
   This from a man who has had the most invasive visit to date.
This month Reid, who is 83, was working at his computer when he
heard a racket upstairs in his bedroom. He went to check, and found
that eight condors had torn through a screen door and were wreaking
havoc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't mad, I was just astonished,'' Reid said. ``I looked
at them. They looked at me. It was as if we were having a meeting.
I said, you have to go the same way you came, and they filed out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reid and his wife, Sally Milhauser Reid, who has advanced
Alzheimer's disease and lives in a Bakersfield institution, had
opposed efforts to take the California condors out of the wild,
urging the authorities to focus more on securing their habitat.
Their fear at the time was that the birds bred in captivity would
become too tame.
</P>
<P>
   He points to the condors' behavior as proof that he and his wife
were right.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mesta, the condor-program coordinator for the Fish and
Wildlife Service, said it remained to be seen whether the
California condors bred in captivity would be different birds from
those that were captured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the population is heavily manipulated to maintain
it in the wild, there is a certain amount of evolution that has to
occur,'' Mesta said. ``These guys are going to have learn to be
wild condors.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems being confronted now are not unlike those that
occurred when the birds were released, only to be killed or injured
when they came into contact with electrical lines. In response,
wildlife officials introduced an exercise in the pre-release flight
pens, in which the birds received mild shocks when they sat on
utility poles.
</P>
<P>
   Puppets have been used in raising the chicks to avoid human
contact, and now officials have also introduced a program to make
the first contact with humans unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Mesta said, ``It wasn't as successful as the
power-pole aversion.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent the birds' nature presents a problem. California
condors have existed in the wild with no predators and, as a
result, no real natural fears. In addition, the condors that fared
best in the wild were the best foragers; these were also the ones
with the most curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Pine Mountain Club, a community of 1,900, is on a flight path
historically used by the condors, and many homes sit enticingly on
ridges where the condors can catch updrafts that allow them to
soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never had any parents out here as role models, so
they've kind of learned everything on their own,'' Barth said. ``So
when they land on a house I try to make it feel wrong to them.''
</P>
<P>
   His concern is not so much that the birds will hurt humans, but
that they will hurt themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife officials are hoping that the birds' interest in humans
will disappear once they come of breeding age, which is 6 to 8
years old. Eleven in the group of 20 staying in the southern part
of the California habitat are 5{ and could possibly begin mating
next spring.
</P>

   ``We're hoping they have to think more about having another
mouth to feed and they won't have time to go curiosity-seeking as
much, if at all,'' Barth said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, wildlife officials and bird enthusiasts said
they would continue to try to strike a balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dilemma, it really is,'' said Clark Moore, a volunteer
condor monitor who conducts community education programs that
encourage residents to shoo the birds away. ``My philosophy is just
keep doing what we're doing until they get to be adults and have
some responsibility. I suppose it's not all that different than
raising a teen-ager.''

   TOKYO _ Taiwan suffered a major aftershock on Sunday that killed
at least three people and injured 58 others, destroyed buildings
and roads already weakened from last week's devastating earthquake,
and sent thousands of horrified residents scurrying for safety.
</P>
<P>
   The aftershock, which measured 6.8, hit at 7:52 a.m. and was
centered about 6 miles east of Sun Moon Lake in Nantou county. This
mountainous region in the middle of the island was the epicenter of
last week's 7.6-magnitude quake, which killed more than 2,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   Local radio and television reports from Taiwan said the
10-second aftershock set off numerous landslides across the
country. At least three motorists died when their cars were buried
on a road in central Yulin county. There were unconfirmed reports
that two children riding with their parents had died on the same
road.
</P>
<P>
   The news reports said people across the island fled buildings in
a panic Sunday morning, many wearing motorcycle helmets and some
only their underwear.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-story apartment complex, already damaged, collapsed on a
busy road in the city of Nantou, and a nearby office building
exploded and burst into flames, the reports said. The 40 apartments
of the complex were evacuated after the quake on Sept. 21, but many
residents had returned recently to gather possessions. It could not
be learned if anyone was hurt in the two buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the injured were rescue workers who were struck by
falling debris in Nantou and Taichung counties, near the epicenter.
Eleven people were hurt by flying glass and other debris in a rice
wine distillery in the town of Puli.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the death and destruction, there were tales of heroic
rescues, even as many Taiwanese had given up hope of finding
survivors beneath the tons of steel and concrete rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Two brothers were rescued on Sunday after being trapped for five
days in a collapsed high-rise building in Taipei. Sun Chiu-kuang,
20, and Sun Chui-feng, 25, survived by eating rotten apples from a
refrigerator buried with them and drinking their own urine and
water sprayed on the rubble by rescue workers, Taipei city
officials said. The officials said the brothers' father had told
them that he had ``been waiting for this moment and that he hadn't
slept since the initial earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, President Lee Teng-hui declared a six-month state
of emergency, giving the military increased powers to maintain
order and imposing severe sentences for overcharging consumers for
basic necessities that have become scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's government has come under sharp criticism for being slow
to respond to the earthquake, which destroyed vital highways and
bridges. Many towns and villages could not be reached by rescuers,
who were also hampered by inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 people remain homeless, and many cities,
including parts of the capital, are without electricity, as the
earthquake and its aftershocks caused severe damage to power
generating plants and substations.
</P>
<P>
   In Taiwan's third largest city, Taichung, thousands of residents
have been sleeping outdoors, fearing aftershocks. In a telephone
interview, one resident, Khu Mu-hsiang, said Sunday that his family
and neighbors were afraid to return to their high-rise apartment
complex and that they planned to continue sleeping in tents in the
elementary school playground across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that we are literally petrified and on edge all
the time,'' he said. ``Each time the ground moves, we keep
wondering when it will stop and if this is finally `the big one.'''
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,300 aftershocks have hit Taiwan since last Tuesday's
earthquake, an average of almost one a minute. Eight of the jolts
measured six or above and have been classified as major quakes in
their own right.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Taiwan's Seismology Center said they expected
aftershocks to continue for several months and that further quakes
of 6.8 magnitude are possible. Taiwan straddles a major fault line
on the western edge of the Pacific ``rim of fire'' and has dozens
of tremors each year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More than 1,000 buildings, mainly high-rise apartment complexes,
have collapsed since the quake last week, and about 5,400 buildings
have been damaged severely, raising concerns that many were not
built according to government codes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government announced a nationwide investigation,
with the help of hundreds of prosecutors, engineers and architects,
to determine if contractors had violated building codes.
</P>
<P>
   Two building contractors have already been arrested, and 16 more
have been prevented from leaving the island. In one case,
investigators found that the support pillars of several collapsed
buildings had been made of concrete that was poured around empty
oil cans, creating huge air bubbles inside that caused the concrete
to collapse in the quake.
</P>
<P>
   American rescue workers who came to Taiwan to assist in the
recovery effort told The Associated Press that they saw similar
corner-cutting just last month in cheap Turkish buildings that used
salty sea sand in concrete. Many of those structures collapsed
during the quake on Aug. 17 that killed more than 15,000 people in
Turkey.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They are at once eerie and gorgeous, the gelatinous
mounds of flesh that feel the pain of rejection so deeply in the
lovely, enigmatic ``Drowning,'' a playlet by Maria Irene Fornes
that is over in the intake of a long, plaintive sigh. These exotic
creatures, animated with Wonderland-ish panache by the costume
designer Teresa Snider-Stein, look like tuskless walruses that have
evolved into bipeds.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, the childlike Pea, touchingly played by Marc Damon
Johnson, has fallen in love with the photograph of a woman in a
newspaper. The picture is a blessing, and then a curse, because the
woman is utterly repulsed when she meets Pea. His innocence
stripped away, he gets his first, corrosive lesson in how to see
himself through others' eyes, a lesson in how to detest himself.
``Is this why we have come to life?'' he asks. ``To love like this?
And hurt like this?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a simple, direct question that Ms. Fornes, a career
avant-gardist, poses in one extreme form or another in many of the
plays she has written over the last four decades, and it will be
one of the concerns explored again and again this year by the
Signature Theater Company, which is devoting its ninth season to
the works of this 69-year-old Cuban-born playwright. It will be a
true adventure for many fans of Signature's one-writer-a-season
concept, because unlike the last three honorees _ John Guare,
Arthur Miller and Sam Shepard _ Ms. Fornes has never found a
mainstream following. On an avenue of department stores, she is
forever a boutique.
</P>
<P>
   That is why she seems even more deserving of the Signature
treatment than some of her more famous colleagues: New York is,
after all, more and more a city of boutiques. And what is Signature
to do if not amplify the voices of those like Ms. Fornes, a
contemporary of trademark playwrights of the '60s and '70s like
Megan Terry and Ntozake Shange, who have a tough time getting
heard? (In earlier seasons the troupe was instrumental in
reinvigorating the reputations of Edward Albee, Horton Foote and
Adrienne Kennedy.)
</P>
<P>
   On the evidence of the first evening of her works, ``Mud'' and
``Drowning,'' both written in the 1980s, Ms. Fornes' inventive
voice, with its embrace of the surreal, will remain a marginal one.
Still, it's worth a listen, if one is willing to listen patiently.
Her plays have the meticulous composition of still lifes, which
means at times they are strikingly balanced and at others opaque,
impassive. The dialogue can be so flat, so lacking in the perfume
of real conversation, that the play could have been grown in a
hothouse, under artificial light. Anaerobic is a word that comes to
mind.
</P>
<P>
   She is perhaps best when writing in short strokes, which reveal
her clever employment of dramatic structures without lapsing into
turgidity. In the fascinating 1982 work ``The Danube,'' for
instance, she wrote a tragedy that she set in Budapest to the
rhythms and conventions of foreign-language instruction tapes. And
in her best-known play (of which you may never have heard), the
1977 ``Fefu and Her Friends,'' Ms. Fornes devised a tragicomedy
about a women's party, a kind of absurdist ``First Wives Club,'' in
which the audience picked up and moved from room to room in Fefu's
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mud'' and ``Drowning,'' which opened Sunday night in
Signature's Peter Norton Space, are given incisive productions by
the director, David Esbjornson, with meaningful assists from the
set designer, Christine Jones, and the lighting designer, Scott
Zielinski. In ``Mud,'' the longer and less interesting of the
pieces, Ms. Fornes explores the joyless existence of a small-town
woman named Mae (Deirdre O'Connell, in a performance of splendid
composure) and the brain-dead men who love, need and destroy her.
</P>
<P>
   The crumbling world in which she slaves _ the rooms of the house
may be as dank and decrepit as prison cells, but there's always a
Beckettesque pair of pants waiting for her to press _ is the
nightmare domain of martyred women everywhere. To make matters
worse, Mae suffers the attentions of Lloyd (Paul Lazar), a fetid,
dimwitted slug whom she tosses out of bed in favor of Henry (John
Seitz), whose sexual and intellectual promise dissolves as a stroke
leaves him just another useless lump for Mae to feed and clean.
Lazar's manchild and Seitz's paralytic interloper are fine
creations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mud'' is arranged in 17 scenes, each ending in a freeze, as if
they were to be posed and added to a photo album of Mae's wasted
life. ``I feel I am hollow and offensive,'' she says, invoking the
language of the victim. We know in Ms. O'Connell's moving
countenance that Mae gets exactly what she doesn't deserve.
</P>
<P>
   The male grotesques of ``Drowning'' are even less well equipped
than Mae to weather everyday brutality; their nerves are as exposed
as their oily, splotchy skin, which undulates in massive folds
around their jaws and shoulders. Johnson's Pea and Philip Goodwin's
gently avuncular Roe share a table at a European cafe, as Pea
relates in three short takes the before-and-after of his
infatuation with the woman in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The playlet is almost over by the time you recover from the
weird effect of the actors' swollen appearances, but Johnson is
nonetheless disconcertingly affecting in the instant of Pea's
discovery of heartache. One leaves the theater wondering where and
when Ms. Fornes might next supply such a disturbing moment of
emotional clarity.
</P>

WHEN AN AIRPORT IS HOME, IT'S HARD TO FLY AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROISSY, France _ In the last 11 years, he has received hundreds
of letters of encouragement, many of them addressed only to ``Sir
Alfred, Charles de Gaulle Airport.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Everyone at the airport post office knew where he
was, sitting quietly on a red plastic bench on the lower level of
Terminal 1, smoking his pipe or listening to the radio, his
belongings stacked neatly on a luggage cart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir Alfred,'' whose real name is Merhan Karimi Nasseri, is an
Iranian exile who has been living in the passenger area of the
airport here since 1988. Without a passport, he has been stuck in a
kind of legal twilight zone.
</P>
<P>
   His must be one of the most bizarre stories in immigration
history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Nasseri was eager to get to England, but 11 years seem
to have taken their toll. Last week, he finally got permission to
leave the airport _ in fact, he can now go wherever he likes in
Europe. The problem is, he no longer wants to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is scared to leave this bubble world he has been living
in,'' said Dr. Philippe Bargain, the airport's medical director.
``Finally getting the papers has been a huge shock to him, as if he
was just thrown from his horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you wait 11 years for something and suddenly in a few
minutes you sign some papers and it's done _ imagine what a shock
that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasseri, a thin, stooped man with melancholy eyes, seems
uncomfortable with the question of what he will do next. Last
weekend, he announced that he would be going to Finland, only to
change his mind within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   He says he must consider his future carefully. He may want to go
to Belgium or England. But his eyes really light up when he talks
about the airport.
</P>
<P>
   He has lived here between the pizzeria and an electronics store,
his days punctuated by the rhythm of the flights. Bustling
travelers gather in the morning and dwindle away in the evening.
Tidy and dignified, Nasseri remains on his bench. He shaves with an
electric razor every morning, washes in the passenger facilities
and takes his clothes to the cleaner here.
</P>
<P>
   He has survived for years on the kindness of strangers. He never
begs. But airport employees routinely give him their meal coupons.
Flight attendants give him toiletries left over from the
first-class passengers. Occasionally, people who have heard his
story send him money in the mail. One traveler gave him a sleeping
bag and a camping mattress, though he generally prefers to sleep on
his curved bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airport is not bad,'' Nasseri said. ``It is very active
and functions every day. I see different passengers every week from
all over the world and it is quite interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasseri arrived at the airport in November 1988, with a one-way
ticket to London, a few clothes, about $500 and no passport. He
told airport authorities that his papers had been stolen at a Paris
train station. Waiving the usual rules, the authorities let him fly
to Heathrow. But there, British immigration officials refused to
let him enter the country, and he was returned to Charles de Gaulle
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the occasional trip to a lawyer's office, he has not
left since.
</P>
<P>
   While French authorities have insisted that Nasseri was on
French soil illegally, they have not deported him, because they
could find no country that would accept him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The details of Nasseri's life before he arrived at Charles de
Gaulle are somewhat of a mystery, as he sometimes tells one story
and sometimes another. Bargain says it has been confirmed that
Nasseri was born in Iran, in the town of Masjid-i-Sulaiman, in
1945. The doctor says it is also likely that, as Nasseri says, his
father was a physician. But what happened to him between 1945 and
1988 is less clear.
</P>
<P>
   What he found particularly odd, Bargain said, was that even with
all the articles and television reports about Nasseri over the
years, no one had ever contacted the airport saying they knew him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have thought that there was someone out there, a
family member, someone he went to school with, someone who knew him
in London, someone who would have come forward and say, `I know
this man.' But it never happened. It was like a big void.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasseri has told various officials that his family sent him to
study in Britain, and court papers indicate that he was there in
the mid-1970s. Nasseri says that when his family stopped sending
money, he returned to Iran, only to be arrested and questioned
about demonstrations in Britain against the shah.
</P>
<P>
   His family managed to obtain his release, he says, but he was
immediately shipped out of the country by the government on a
nonrenewable passport with a one-year expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   Once out of Iran, he applied for political asylum in several
European countries. All refused him, he says. Then, in 1986,
Belgium granted him refugee status.
</P>
<P>
   But Nasseri promptly lost his papers in the Paris train station
in August 1988. A few months later, he bought the ticket for
England, determined to gain British citizenship because, he said,
his mother had been British.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he has become a small celebrity here. French
television has done a documentary on him. When news leaked out that
he would be leaving, half a dozen foreign journalists appeared for
the occasion. Nasseri clearly enjoys the attention. ``Please,
sit,'' he says to the journalists who arrive to interview him.
</P>
<P>
   More than six years ago, his case was taken by a human rights
lawyer, Christian Bourguet, who last July finally got the Belgian
authorities to hand over papers proving that Nasseri was a bona
fide political refugee. It was those documents that enabled the
French to provide the residence and travel papers last week.
</P>
<P>
   Nasseri knows that much has changed in the years he has lived
inside. He listens to the news for hours each day, meticulously
recording much of what he hears in a diary that now takes up seven
cardboard boxes. He considers the breakup of the Soviet Union the
most important single event.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, he said, he took a correspondence course in
business administration. But he no longer does that. He does like
reading, however, and has more than 50 books tucked away on the
trolley.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the airport workers here call him ``Alfred,'' though
no-one can remember how the nickname started. Most say they can
understand how it would be hard for him to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, even if he has the papers, where does he go?'' said
Sergio Parreira, manager of the McDonald's on the lower level.
``The world is a little savage outside these walls. He has been
protected all this time. And at his age, how do you start over?''
</P>
<P>
   Bargain said that the airport took no action against Nasseri,
because there was nowhere to send him. But now that he had his
papers, they would contact social agencies to help him make the
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will have to be weaned from the airport, like an addict
really.'' Bargain said. ``Still, it does make you wonder what kind
of a society we live in that this can happen to a man.''

   The speaker, Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., appearing on Face the
Nation on CBS, said, ``It's not our intent to have a government
shutdown.'' But he said that such a shutdown was always ``a
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1995, a budget impasse led to the shutdown of parts
of the federal government, for which Republicans in Congress were
widely blamed.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the same program, Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the
House minority leader, said, ``I think we're going to miss the
deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they were merely acknowledging what has been obvious
for weeks as spending bills became bogged down in the fight over
tax cuts and other fiscal issues, missing the budget deadline is
still a disappointment to the Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans said from the first of the year they were
going to get everything done on time,'' said Gephardt. ``They
haven't done that.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said that Clinton would prefer
a continuing resolution for two weeks rather than three, because
``we think they ought to be able to get their work done sooner.''
He said Clinton would sign a continuing resolution if it simply
continued spending authority at 1999 levels for any federal
agencies whose 2000 budgets have not been passed by Congress and
signed by the president; if Congress attaches other provisions to
the resolution that the president does not like, then he would veto
it, he said. The result would be a partial shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   The federal budget is divided into 13 spending bills, of which
Congress has sent four to the White House. Clinton is threatening
to veto seven of the 13, and has already done so with one, an
appropriation for the District of Columbia budget, because it puts
limits on certain actions by the District government. Of the three
others that have passed, he has signed one, a bill on military
construction, and has not said what action he will take on the two
others, the budgets of the Treasury and the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the Republicans is that they have repeatedly
promised not to dip into the surplus accumulated this year by the
Social Security system to pay for other areas of government, but
the individual committees with budget authority are working on
spending plans that would do just that, to the tune of billions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said Sunday, ``Congress has spent the Social Security
trust funds for the last 40 years, almost 40 years, ever since
L.B.J. in 1967 passed the Great Society and funded the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying not to do that now,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hastert also declined to distance himself from a Republican
presidential candidate, Pat Buchanan, who has threatened to leave
the party and seek the nomination of the Reform Party. Sen. John
McCain, of Arizona, another Republican presidential candidate, has
called on Republicans to repudiate Buchanan because of his writings
and statements on the American involvement in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should be able to accept people with a lot of
divergent views, and I think that's good for the debate within the
party,'' Hastert said. ``So I would urge Pat Buchanan to stay,
carry out the debate within the party, and let the people make the
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan continued to defend his recent book in an appearance
Sunday on CNN's Late Edition, calling it ``a boring, scholarly work
on foreign policy'' and saying that he considered the war ``a noble
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Mr. McCain did not read the book,'' he said. ``I
don't want to continue to quarrel with him. I do believe he was
misled in saying that I did not think it was a noble cause, and I
think I said so all week long, and there's no need, I think, on my
part to continue the quarrel.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Buchanan called for a noninterventionist
foreign policy. He called the Kosovo intervention ``an
unconstitutional, undeclared war. The smashing of Serbia, which had
nothing to do with us, I thought was an outrage, I was ashamed of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was a leading voice for intervening in Kosovo earlier
this year.

<P>
   Big names and big moments helped make 1988 the most memorable
year in an incredible decade of sports.
</P>
<P>
   The year marked Tom Landry's 29th and final season with the
Cowboys, though he didn't know it at the time. New owner Jerry
Jones fired Landry during the off-season and hired Jimmy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   News from the NHL was just as stunning, with The Great One,
Wayne Gretzky, traded by the Edmonton Oilers to the Los Angeles
Kings, along with two other players for two players, three
first-round draft picks and $15 million. Gretzky had led Edmonton
to four Stanley Cup titles in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer dramatics, nothing topped Kirk Gibson's home run in
Game 1 of the World Series against Oakland. Thought to be out of
the Series because of a leg injury, Gibson was sent to the plate as
a pinch-hitter with two out in the ninth against A's All-Star
reliever Dennis Eckersley. His blast into the right-field seats
gave the Los Angeles Dodgers a 5-4 victory, propelling the Dodgers
to the Series title. It was Gibson's only Series at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Also back on top was another familiar name, Notre Dame, led by
coach Lou Holtz. The Irish won their first national title in 11
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In tennis, one legend lost and another was on the rise as Steffi
Graf's remarkable career took full flight. The young German ended
Martina Navratilova's six-year reign at Wimbledon and became the
new standard-bearer of women's tennis, winning the Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   Florence Griffith Joyner stole the show at a memorable Olympics
in Seoul with golds in the 100 (a world record), 200 and 4X100
relay. Soiling the games was the sad saga of Ben Johnson. Two days
after winning the 100-meter dash in a world-record 9.79 seconds,
Johnson tested positive for steroids and was stripped of his gold
medal.

INNOVATIONS FOR THE 1980S

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PGA Senior Tour: In 1978, a tournament called The Legends of
Golf in Austin introduced America to the concept of competition
among older players who were no longer competing on the PGA Tour.
It was supposed to be a one-time event, but response from
spectators and television viewers went through the roof. That
prompted organizers to hold the tournament again in '79. By 1980,
interest in the over-50 set was so high that the PGA Tour decided
to cash in by creating the Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Instant replay: The use of replay as an officiating aid was
approved by the NFL for the first time in 1986, but there were
practical problems from the beginning, notably the extended delays
while the official studied the replays. Even so, the NFL owners
voted to keep replay for six consecutive seasons before finally
overturning it in 1992. Replay returned to the league this season
with a new system that allows coaches to challenge calls.
</P>
<P>
   Salary cap: With payrolls skyrocketing faster than profits, NBA
owners and players made an unprecedented agreement in 1984, putting
a limit, or cap, on the salaries a team could pay its players. A
year later, the NBA moved to the concept of a ``soft'' cap by
implementing the so-called Larry Bird exception, allowing teams to
exceed the cap in order to sign free agents already on their roster
(which allowed the Celtics to keep Bird).
</P>
<P>
   West Coast offense: The offense, based on controlling the ball
with short passes rather than the run, was devised by Bill Walsh in
his days at Stanford and as an assistant with the Cincinnati
Bengals. But it was Walsh's Super Bowl champions in San Francisco
that popularized it and spawned countless imitators in the college
and pro football ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Shot clock and 3-pointer: In 1982, four of college basketball's
greatest players _ North Carolina's Michael Jordan, James Worthy
and Sam Perkins and Virginia's Ralph Sampson _ played in the
Atlantic Coast Conference championship game, and the best they
could do was a 47-45 snoozer (the Tar Heels won). To get scoring
back in the game, the ACC experimented with a 30-second clock and a
short 17-foot, 9-inch arc for the 3-point shot the following year.
Fans loved the higher-scoring, more entertaining games. The NCAA
adopted a 45-second clock for the 1985-86 season and a year later
put in a 3-point line at 19 feet, 9 inches.

TEAM OF THE DECADE

By MAC ENGEL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Feb. 22, 1980, in Lake Placid, N.Y., a group of amateur
hockey players made being American fun again.
</P>
<P>
   Team USA's remember-where-you-were-when-it-happened 4-3 victory
against the heavily favored Soviets, for a while, made people
forget about a gloomy economy and growing world tensions
exacerbated by the Soviets' invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.
President Carter had pledged the week before to boycott the Moscow
summer games. The ongoing Iranian hostage crisis would not end
until January 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets, who defeated a team of NHL All-Stars the previous
year, had won the gold medal every Olympics since 1960 and were
prohibitive favorites to do so again.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, seeded seventh in the 12-team field, finished
the preliminary round with a 4-0-1 record punctuated with a 7-3
victory against a talented Czechoslovakian team and advanced to the
semifinals of the medal round against the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they played us 10 more times, they'd probably beat us every
time,'' said Neal Broten, a center on the team.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets took 1-0 and 2-1 leads before Mark Johnson scored
with one second remaining in the first period, prompting Soviet
coach Viktor Tikhonev to pull legendary goalie Vladislav Tretiak in
favor of Vladimir Myshkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't even realize he \RTretiak\S was out of there until
the middle of the next period,'' Broten said. ``But after that
first period we knew we could win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets led 3-2 in the second period before Johnson again
tied the score with a power-play goal. With 10 minutes remaining,
captain Mike Eruzione fired a wrister through a screen that beat
Myshkin for a 4-3 lead. Goalie Jim Craig made the lead hold up for
a victory that sent fans in the arena into bedlam and a nation into
euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the things I did in my career, that was numero uno,''
said Broten, whose jersey was retired by the Stars after 20-NHL
seasons. ``We weren't expected to win a medal, let alone a gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the United States did win gold when it defeated
Finland, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   But, the real medal was won when, for a few hours, people who
didn't even care about hockey or sports again loved being
Americans. \Nsubheds:Runners-up
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Lakers: .721 winning percentage, five NBA titles San
Francisco 49ers: .688 winning percentage, four Super Bowls Miami

CONTROVERSY OF THE DECADE 
WITH THE CENTURY IN SPORTS PACKAGE

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If drug abuse among athletes was common before the 1980s, the
public knew little about it. That all changed in a decade when
suspensions of high-profile athletes evolved from stunning news to
become almost commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA led the movement toward more aggressive testing and
rehabiliation. New commissioner David Stern was charged with
regaining credibility for a league plagued by poor attendance and
TV ratings in the 1970s in part because of the perception its
players used drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Even stiff penalties and rehabilitation programs couldn't save
everyone. In 1986, four of the NBA's top seven draft picks were
linked to drugs. Len Bias, taken No. 2 overall by the Boston
Celtics, died of a cocaine overdose two days after the draft. Chris
Washburn, chosen third, was eventually thrown out of the NBA after
two drug-plagued seasons. William Bedford, taken sixth, was
suspended twice. Roy Tarpley, taken seventh by the Mavericks
despite their knowledge of his drug use at the University of
Michigan, was banned, reinstated and banned again for substance
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Random testing for steroids and illegal drugs made its way to
the NFL. Among those suspended were big names such as Hall of Fame
linebacker Lawrence Taylor. Most puzzling was the bizarre case of
Bengals running back Stanley Wilson. Caught high on cocaine the
night before Super Bowl XXIII in 1989, Wilson was banned for life
by the NFL and is now serving 22 years in prison for burglary.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Major League Baseball is sports' most lenient body
on substance abuse. New York Yankees pitcher Steve Howe, suspended
seven times, became the poster boy for baseball's tolerance. Howe
was thrown out of baseball permanently in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Olympics officials began policing more heavily for
peformance-enhancing substances in the 1980s but often fought a
losing battle against athletes who masked their use of drugs. In
1988, however, Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson's positive test for
steriods resulted in him being stripped of a gold medal in the 100
meters.
</P>
<P>
   Few fans, by the late '80s, were shocked by the news.

MELVIN, OATES SAFE FROM CORPORATE RAIDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Hicks showed some foresight when he gave an extra year to
general manager Doug Melvin and manager Johnny Oates on their
latest contract extensions.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks has noticed corporate raiding is becoming common among
major-league teams as they scurry to fill general manager and
manager positions.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland general manager Billy Beane is among the most coveted
executives around. The Seattle Mariners are interested, and there
is speculation Beane could end up with the Anaheim Angels,
replacing Bill Bavasi.
</P>
<P>
   Beane deserves the praise for turning the Athletics around, but
the players deserve some credit. They publicly stood strong behind
manager Art Howe during the lean years when it appeared Beane and
Sandy Alderson were ready to fire him. My vote _ which is an
official one _ goes to Howe as manager of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Rockies wanted Cleveland general manager John Hart,
who is expected to move on when the Indians are sold. But they were
told he was unavailable, so they settled for his long-time
assistant, Dan O'Dowd.
</P>
<P>
   Indians hitting coach Charlie Manuel is a strong candidate to
replace Rockies manager Jim Leyland, but Buddy Bell, who worked
under O'Dowd in Cleveland before going to Detroit, is another good
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Garner, another hot name, could surface there or a dozen
other places. Baltimore is a possibility. Even though the Orioles
are the hottest team in baseball, it won't do manager Ray Miller
much good. He's still expected to be gone at the end of the season,
but the Orioles are expected to stay with Frank Wren as general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Garner could also end up with the Cubs, although Triple-A Iowa
manager Terry Kennedy is the likely candidate to replace Jim
Riggleman. However, with former Minnesota Twins general manager
Andy MacPhail now the Cubs' president, don't be surprised if they
take a run at Tom Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are also thinking big in their general manager
search. They've talked to Bob Watson, who won a World Series with
the Yankees in 1996, and Pat Gillick, who built the Blue Jays'
dynasty and did well in Baltimore before growing tired of owner
Peter Angelos.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners also considered Dean Taylor, who was the Braves'
assistant when he got the job in Milwaukee. Taylor's next move is
to hire a manager, and Don Baylor, the former Rockies manager who
is now the Braves hitting coach, is the top candidate there.
Another strong candidate is Yankees hitting coach Chris Chambliss.
</P>
<P>
   Garner, Baylor, Chambliss and Oakland coach Ken Macha are among
the names being mentioned in Anaheim to replace Terry Collins, and
it would be a shock if Baylor isn't managing somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't look like there will be an opening in Detroit.
Detroit president John McHale and general manager Randy Smith are
publicly supporting manager Larry Parrish, although owner Mike
Ilitch will have the final say. Ilitch was smitten with Parrish
last fall, but some of that admiration has cooled during the
Tigers' disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres have also had a rough year, but owner John
Moores said last week he stands behind general manager Kevin Towers
and manager Bruce Bochy and hopes they are with the franchise
``forever.''
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT on Sammy Sosa
 &LR; pcredit:Chicago Tribune/Milbert Orlando Brown via AP The Chicago
Cubs pay Sammy Sosa an average of $10 million per year, but after
consecutive seasons of 60 or more home runs, the Cubs think he
might want more money.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs expecting Sosa to ask for more money
Word out of Chicago is Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa wants to
renegoiate his contract. Sosa's four-year, $42.5 million extension
that he received in 1997 seemed excessive at the time; he and Gary
Sheffield were the first two players to average $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently it's now inadequate, what with Sosa hitting 60
homers for the second consecutive year and Dodgers pitcher Kevin
Brown making $15 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa will make $10 million in 2000, $11 million in 2001 and
there's a mutual option for 2002 at $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Sammy has concerns or thoughts, we have to try and do what
we can,'' Cubs general manager Ed Lynch said in the Chicago
Sun-Times. ``Sammy obviously is one of the great players in
baseball. When Sammy talks, we listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Also there has been some insinuation that Sosa is getting
slighted this year as far as people paying attention to his home
run exploits.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire took up this theme when he said, ``I personally
thought when he hit 60 he should have been the lead story on every
sports network. He wasn't, which is a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's just that the focus is back on the pennant races,
which is still the most important thing about September.
\Nsubheds:Quick hits
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have a third-base controversy brewing as they
approach the playoffs. John Valentin, who missed three weeks
because of a bad knee, was activated off the disabled list Thursday
and says he's ready. But the Red Sox were 15-5 with rookie Wilton
Veras at third during Valentin's absence. Veras, younger and
stronger, is hitting .295 this year, while Valentin is at .251 and
still bothered by the knee.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are also taking a hard look at rookie left fielder
Daryle Ward, who is hitting .271 with seven home runs and 25 runs
batted in. He might force Derek Bell, slumping and hurt, out of the
lineup in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Giants outfielder Ellis Burks had 91 RBI in 375 at-bats coming
into the weekend. That's the third highest RBI total in his career
and gave him a chance to be the first National Leaguer in history
to get 100 RBI in less than 400 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa might treat us to a slam-bang finish
when the Cardinals and the Cubs meet for three games next weekend
in St. Louis. But neither one should even come close to winning the
National League MVP Award. Jeff Bagwell, Chipper Jones and Matt
Williams are far more deserving.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Rogers, 5-0 with the Mets, suddenly loves New York and
wants to stay: ``If they want me back, I'd love to stay. I'd be
crazy not to. With the kind of defense this team plays, with the
guys who can hit, and an ownership that looks like it wants to do
things, I love this place.''
</P>
<P>
   With their attendance down from 2.4 milion to 1.6 million, the
Devil Rays are talking with veterans Roberto Hernandez, Fred
McGriff and John Flaherty about deferring some of the money in
their contracts so the club can be active in the free-agent market
this off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays pitcher David Wells, on speculation he might be traded
so the club can sign Carlos Delgado and Shawn Green, ``Let me tell
you something, you don't win without pitching. You can have all the
guys you want hitting 50 homers, but you're not going to win. You
got to have pitching, good defense and they go hand in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' 11-3 victory against Colorado Wednesday gave
them a 157-157 record over the past two years. That's the quickest
an expansion team has reached the .500 mark. The Kansas City Royals
were the previous quickest, reaching the .500 mark in their eighth
season.
</P>
<P>
   Braves pitcher John Smoltz has been fooling around with a
knuckleball.
</P>
<P>
   Further erosion of the Dodgers occurred when Triple-A manager
Mike Scioscia announced he was leaving the organization to pursue a
job with another team. Scioscia, a future major-league managerial
candidate, wasn't happy with his future with the club.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies prospect Pat Burrell, the first overall pick in the
1998 draft, hit .333 with 28 home runs and 90 RBI in 117 games at
Double-A Reading, and could force Ron Gant out of left field next
year.

   Phil Garner, another hot name, could surface there or a dozen
other places. Baltimore is a possibility. Even though the Orioles
are the hottest team in baseball, it won't do manager Ray Miller
much good. He's still expected to be gone at the end of the season,
but the Orioles are expected to stay with Frank Wren as general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Garner could also end up with the Cubs, although Triple-A Iowa
manager Terry Kennedy is the likely candidate to replace Jim
Riggleman. However, with former Minnesota Twins general manager
Andy MacPhail now the Cubs' president, don't be surprised if they
take a run at Tom Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are also thinking big in their general manager
search. They've talked to Bob Watson, who won a World Series with
the Yankees in 1996, and Pat Gillick, who built the Blue Jays'
dynasty and did well in Baltimore before growing tired of owner
Peter Angelos.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners also considered Dean Taylor, who was the Braves'
assistant when he got the job in Milwaukee. Taylor's next move is
to hire a manager, and Don Baylor, the former Rockies manager who
is now the Braves hitting coach, is the top candidate there.
Another strong candidate is Yankees hitting coach Chris Chambliss.
</P>
<P>
   Garner, Baylor, Chambliss and Oakland coach Ken Macha are among
the names being mentioned in Anaheim to replace Terry Collins, and
it would be a shock if Baylor isn't managing somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't look like there will be an opening in Detroit.
Detroit president John McHale and general manager Randy Smith are
publicly supporting manager Larry Parrish, although owner Mike
Ilitch will have the final say. Ilitch was smitten with Parrish
last fall, but some of that admiration has cooled during the
Tigers' disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres have also had a rough year, but owner John
Moores said last week he stands behind general manager Kevin Towers
and manager Bruce Bochy and hopes they are with the franchise
``forever.''
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT on Sammy Sosa
 &LR; pcredit:Chicago Tribune/Milbert Orlando Brown via AP The Chicago
Cubs pay Sammy Sosa an average of $10 million per year, but after
consecutive seasons of 60 or more home runs, the Cubs think he
might want more money.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs expecting Sosa to ask for more money
Word out of Chicago is Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa wants to
renegoiate his contract. Sosa's four-year, $42.5 million extension
that he received in 1997 seemed excessive at the time; he and Gary
Sheffield were the first two players to average $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently it's now inadequate, what with Sosa hitting 60
homers for the second consecutive year and Dodgers pitcher Kevin
Brown making $15 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa will make $10 million in 2000, $11 million in 2001 and
there's a mutual option for 2002 at $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Sammy has concerns or thoughts, we have to try and do what
we can,'' Cubs general manager Ed Lynch said in the Chicago
Sun-Times. ``Sammy obviously is one of the great players in
baseball. When Sammy talks, we listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Also there has been some insinuation that Sosa is getting
slighted this year as far as people paying attention to his home
run exploits.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire took up this theme when he said, ``I personally
thought when he hit 60 he should have been the lead story on every
sports network. He wasn't, which is a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's just that the focus is back on the pennant races,
which is still the most important thing about September.
\Nsubheds:Quick hits
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have a third-base controversy brewing as they
approach the playoffs. John Valentin, who missed three weeks
because of a bad knee, was activated off the disabled list Thursday
and says he's ready. But the Red Sox were 15-5 with rookie Wilton
Veras at third during Valentin's absence. Veras, younger and
stronger, is hitting .295 this year, while Valentin is at .251 and
still bothered by the knee.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are also taking a hard look at rookie left fielder
Daryle Ward, who is hitting .271 with seven home runs and 25 runs
batted in. He might force Derek Bell, slumping and hurt, out of the
lineup in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Giants outfielder Ellis Burks had 91 RBI in 375 at-bats coming
into the weekend. That's the third highest RBI total in his career
and gave him a chance to be the first National Leaguer in history
to get 100 RBI in less than 400 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa might treat us to a slam-bang finish
when the Cardinals and the Cubs meet for three games next weekend
in St. Louis. But neither one should even come close to winning the
National League MVP Award. Jeff Bagwell, Chipper Jones and Matt
Williams are far more deserving.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Rogers, 5-0 with the Mets, suddenly loves New York and
wants to stay: ``If they want me back, I'd love to stay. I'd be
crazy not to. With the kind of defense this team plays, with the
guys who can hit, and an ownership that looks like it wants to do
things, I love this place.''
</P>
<P>
   With their attendance down from 2.4 milion to 1.6 million, the
Devil Rays are talking with veterans Roberto Hernandez, Fred
McGriff and John Flaherty about deferring some of the money in
their contracts so the club can be active in the free-agent market
this off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays pitcher David Wells, on speculation he might be traded
so the club can sign Carlos Delgado and Shawn Green, ``Let me tell
you something, you don't win without pitching. You can have all the
guys you want hitting 50 homers, but you're not going to win. You
got to have pitching, good defense and they go hand in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' 11-3 victory against Colorado Wednesday gave
them a 157-157 record over the past two years. That's the quickest
an expansion team has reached the .500 mark. The Kansas City Royals
were the previous quickest, reaching the .500 mark in their eighth
season.
</P>
<P>
   Braves pitcher John Smoltz has been fooling around with a
knuckleball.
</P>
<P>
   Further erosion of the Dodgers occurred when Triple-A manager
Mike Scioscia announced he was leaving the organization to pursue a
job with another team. Scioscia, a future major-league managerial
candidate, wasn't happy with his future with the club.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies prospect Pat Burrell, the first overall pick in the
1998 draft, hit .333 with 28 home runs and 90 RBI in 117 games at
Double-A Reading, and could force Ron Gant out of left field next
year.

DALLAS STARS' MODANO HOPES TO MIX OFFENSIVE GLORY WITH TEAM
SUCCESS 
HEADLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The feeling was like no other as Mike Modano
hoisted hockey's ultimate prize.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Cup was the reward for enduring those long, hard
practices. For squelching the desire to rebel when coach Ken
Hitchcock relentlessly demanded more, more of a team that already
had the best record in the NHL. For checking his ego at the door
and sacrificing his considerable individual skills for the sake of
the Stars' defense-first style.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Cup symbolizes teamwork, and Mike Modano was a team
player.
</P>
<P>
   That was three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars begin defense of the Cup on Friday, when they play the
Pittsburgh Penguins in the regular-season opener at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   With his name safely engraved on the precious trophy, Modano
thinks about the next step, the next level, of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Almost wistfully, he dreams of individual glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to finally get to the 100-point plateau,'' he said.
``MVPs and all that stuff, it would be nice to have a piece of that
before it's all over.''
</P>
<P>
   He also would like to hoist the Cup again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great that we accomplished what we did last year, but it
would be even greater to sustain that level,'' Modano said. ``It
was a great year and we enjoyed it a lot, but we all feel that we
have another good year or two in us that we can be effective and
maybe take another run at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano has proved he's a wizard with a hockey stick, but it
would take a remarkable magic trick to do both, to score 100 points
while playing Hitchcock's Cup-winning, team-oriented style that
stresses using defense to generate the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does, he's pretty good,'' linemate Brett Hull said. ``I
would say he can, but I think Mike's got responsibilities in other
places that doesn't allow it. If they just turned him loose like
Jagr, he could do what Jagr does. But he's got other
responsibilities that the team considers more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull is talking about Jaromir Jagr, the Penguins' forward who
led the league with 127 points last season and won the Hart
Memorial Trophy, the MVP award Modano dreams of.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr, though, plays on a team with a wide-open style. The
Penguins scored 242 goals, fourth in the NHL, but gave up 225. The
Stars scored 236 goals, eighth in the league, while allowing a mere
168, fewest in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Modano, whose career high is 93 points, had 81 last year, 13th
in the NHL. But, as Hull pointed out, Jagr doesn't have the other
responsibilities that Modano has, the commitment to playing a
two-way game.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock has no problem with Modano aiming for 100 points, but
doesn't want it to interfere with helping the team win in other
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's capable of reaching it, but I don't think you want to do
that at the risk of undermining his game,'' Hitchcock said. ``His
game is a winning game. He really is a productive player in a lot
of areas other than just points. What I would rather be looking for
is how many of the points he's scoring are important points, how
many are important goals, where his plus/minus is at.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are challenges. To me, if he was the top plus/minus
player in the league, if he led our team in winning goals and
winning points, that would be a big challenge for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano isn't a selfish player. He's not going to push team goals
aside while he pursues a scoring title. He's prepared to once again
work hard in the gritty part of the game, to forecheck, to
backcheck, to kill penalties.
</P>
<P>
   But he sees no conflict between playing Hitchcock's style and
scoring 100 points. The reason: his talented line mates, Hull and
Jere Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very conservative system, but what you do with the puck
is what sets good players apart from other players, your ability to
make plays and create plays,'' Modano said. ``All three of us have
good shots we can get off, and we see the ice pretty well. We check
and shut down good teams and that allows us to have more time with
the puck. If we have more time with the puck, points will come and
good things will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Stars signed Hull, who has topped the 100-point plateau
four times and scored 50-plus goals five times, before last season,
conventional wisdom said the Stars' No. 1 line would be one of the
best in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The line indeed had moments of brilliance, but injuries kept it
from reaching its full potential. Hull played in just 60 of the
team's 82 games, Lehtinen 74 and Modano 77.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that line's played together enough,'' Hitchcock
said. ``I'd like to see that line be at least able to stay together
for 70 games. If Brett can adapt to that style and stay healthy,
then the line has a real good chance to be one of the strongest in
the league if not the strongest.''
</P>
<P>
   It also would help if Lehtinen, a two-time Selke Award winner as
the best defensive forward in the league, adds more offense to his
game. Hitchcock thinks that will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Visions of an improving Lehtinen and a healthy Hull fuel
Modano's dreams of taking the next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the three of us stay healthy we can all accomplish
things,'' he said. ``Brett can get 50 goals, I think Jeri can get a
point a game, and I can get 100 points. We can have one of the more
dominating lines in the league. That would be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And scoring 100 points while winning the Stanley Cup again? That
would double the fun.

CHAN GAILEY'S OffENSE AND CHAN GAILEY MAINTAIN SEPARATE IDENTITIES 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One week, they win on haymakers, gadget plays and Rocket
launches. The next week, they sort of schmooze their way to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Teams frequently take on the personality of their coach. The
Cowboys have taken on the multiple personality of the Chan Gailey
Offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are 2-0 with a bye today, which basically means that
the Gailey Offense is idle and Gailey is home thinking up gadget
plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Gailey Offense is not the West Coast offense, which is to
say that it's not the trendy horizontal passing offense developed
by Bill Walsh in San Francisco and thoroughly mimicked this past
decade by an NFL coaching fraternity unafraid to copy off somebody
else's paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're anything but the West Coast offense,'' said Cowboys
quarterback Troy Aikman, who threw 49 times against Washington and
22 times against Atlanta. ``I think Chan's system is a little bit
more of a throwback system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much about getting five guys out into routes, or
about flooding zones, as it is about Chan wanting to establish the
running game with Emmitt \RSmith\S, then doing some things in the
passing game off of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey and the Chan Gailey Offense should never be confused
with one another. They hail from separate planets, operate on
dichotomous wave engths, maintain their separate identities and are
entitled to their own idiosyncrasies.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's Georgia-grown personality is a lot like his golf game,
straight down the middle. Gailey's run-oriented, vertical-passing
offense is, at times, a lot like Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey is khaki pants and a button-down oxford shirt. Gailey's
game plan is a mix of old world and new millennium. It's a blend of
no-nonsense running game between the tackles and a read-and-react
pass offense designed to exploit a defense's weaknesses as the play
is still unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Chandler Gailey, age 47, is pretty much ``what you see is
what you get.'' The Gailey offensive game plan, in its second
season with the Cowboys, is more along the lines of ``what you get,
you can only wonder if you're going to see it again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaching is a guessing game, but there are two sets of
cat-and-mouse ... preparation and game-day adjustments,'' said
Gailey, who seems to enjoy the mental gymnastics required in doing
the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You evaluate what you do as an offense and what the opposing
defense will be trying to do to stop you,'' Gailey said. ``Watching
film ... the whole preparation part, that's really enjoyable to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other part is the game-day adjustments, and I enjoy that,
too. It involves figuring out what did they change, how do we
adjust to it, and how quickly?''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey is his own offensive coordinator, which was an absolute
prerequisite for anyone trying to convince Cowboys owner Jerry
Jones that he could be Barry Switzer's successor two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was looking for ``someone creative yet fundamental,'' who
would not sacrifice the basic fundamental approach to winning in
the NFL by running the football and never letting them see you
flinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very unpredictable,'' said Cowboys defensive coordinator
Dave Campo, who is happy to be on the same team as Gailey. ``You're
not sure if you're going to get five wide receivers or an empty
backfield, or maybe a no-huddle \Roffense\S right in the middle of
the whole deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a coaching staff getting ready to play a Chan
Gailey-coached offense, you'd better make sure that you can handle
every single different personnel group that he might show you ...
and he has a good `feel' for what is going to work. So it's very
difficult to get a bead on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said there is one myth about his offense. It's the Gailey
playbook. It's not as thick as the Manhattan phone book or as
difficult to digest as Sanskrit.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to set the record straight this week. It's
``normal-size'' and ``just a normal playbook,'' said Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Gailey would script the first eight to 10 plays of
a game. This season, he has decided to ``group'' plays according to
down-and-distance, then meet with Aikman on Saturday night and go
over which ones Aikman feels most comfortable in using.
</P>
<P>
   The past two seasons, Gailey has put Aikman in the shotgun to
maximize his view of the field in obvious passing situations.
Gailey said he wants Aikman to feel that he has the freedom to
audible out of a bad play into a good one, which is exactly what he
did on the second David LaFleur touchdown pass against Washington
in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   The call was an off-tackle run. Aikman audibled into a quick-out
to his tight end. Gailey loved the adjustment that was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan's offense is different and there's something to that,''
said Campo. ``It's a little like it was with the wishbone in
college football where you would face the same basic `look' week
after week, then all of a sudden you were facing something
different.''
</P>
<P>
   So what makes Chan Gailey's offense ``different''?
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the multiple formations and varied schemes with a
myriad of players rotating in and out of the game, Gailey attacks
downfield with the pass, yet uses a power running game to control
down-and-distance, clock, field-position, all those facets of the
game that, ironically, make the Chan Gailey offense both sound and
exotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an innovative offense,'' said Campo. ``Chan is not a
one-dimensional guy. You have to defend the whole field with him,
and you have to be ready to handle unusual things at unusual
times.''

GM AND UAW HOPE TO REACH PACT THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert new 9th and 10th grafs noting strike deadline set
by Canadian union and adding quote from Canadian union's
president.)  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors and the United Automobile Workers union
hope to reach a new, four-year labor contract within the next
several days, as the relationship between the world's largest
company and its main union appears to have improved considerably
since last year's 54-day strike in Flint, Mich., auto industry and
union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for the two sides worked through the weekend to mold
an agreement similar to that concluded by the union with
DaimlerChrysler AG on Sept. 16. DaimlerChrysler workers voted on
that agreement on Saturday. While the vote count is not scheduled
for release until Monday, local union officials predicted that the
pact would be easily ratified.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW's previous, three-year agreement with GM,
DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor Co. expired on Sept. 14, but the
union has agreed to keep workers on the job while it negotiates
with each company. A GM official close to the talks said Sunday,
``They're making progress, they met until very late last night.''
</P>
<P>
   The UAW agreement with DaimlerChrysler and a pact by the
Canadian Auto Workers union with Ford last Tuesday both call for
wage increases that exceed the inflation rate by nearly 3 percent,
plus a wide range of benefits. The UAW contract also limits how
quickly DaimlerChrysler can shrink its work force through
attrition, a provision that might cause some difficulties for GM.
</P>
<P>
   If GM accepts an identical provision, it could continue
downsizing but with some limits on how quickly it does so. Another
issue in the talks involves the extent to which workers at GM's
former auto parts division, which it spun off in May, will be able
to return to job openings at GM.
</P>
<P>
   Labor relations between GM and the UAW have improved since last
year's strike for several reasons. GM appears to have suffered a
small but permanent loss of market share because of the strike,
making neither the company nor the union eager to repeat the
experience. The American auto market is booming, leaving every
automaker straining to keep up with production and autoworkers
reluctant to risk their profit-sharing checks on another walkout.
And GM has completely revamped its approach to labor negotiations
since last year.
</P>
<P>
   GM strongly criticized union leaders during last year's strike,
in an unsuccessful bid to persuade employees that the work stoppage
was a mistake. After the strike, GM brought home a quiet-spoken
American executive, Gary Cowger, who had been running GM's German
subsidiary, and gave him unusually broad authority as group vice
president for labor relations. His predecessor, Gerald Knechtel,
had been only a vice president, and had less authority.
</P>
<P>
   Cowger, who likes to talk about his grandchildren and who spent
the first 13 years of his career working his way up through
supervisory positions at a GM assembly plant in Kansas City, Kan.,
has gotten along very well with UAW leaders, said a union official
who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A deal with the UAW would not guarantee a strike-free autumn for
GM. It must still reach an agreement with the Canadian Auto Workers
union. The Canadian union wants GM and DaimlerChrysler to sign
contracts in Canada similar to Ford's; the union announced Sunday
afternoon that workers had ratified the Ford contract. The union
said it would seek a new labor contract with DaimlerChrysler next,
setting a strike deadline of Oct. 5 for a pact.
</P>
<P>
   Basil Hargrove, the Canadian union's president, said that he was
leaving GM for last partly because it posed the toughest issues.
``We have an incredible amount of problems at GM,'' mainly
involving job security, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scott Sprinzen, the managing director for auto industry credit
ratings at Standard &AMP; Poor's, said that a peaceful labor settlement
between GM and the UAW would be welcome on Wall Street. Standard &AMP;
Poor's currently assigns a single-A rating to GM's long-term
credit, but because of the potential for labor unrest, the rating
comes with a ``negative outlook,'' which means that it may be
downgraded.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they reach an agreement in the U.S. and Canada, we could
well take a look at that negative outlook,'' Sprinzen said. Any
improvement in GM's credit rating would save the company money by
allowing it to borrow money at lower interest rates.

 &HT;    Bush to be lone GOP candidate at Florida convention
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Cokie Roberts is out and so is God.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the media deity nor that higher authority were enough to
convince all of the GOP's presidential candidates to come to
Florida next month.
</P>
<P>
   Only Texas Gov. George W. Bush is showing up at the state
Republican convention in Orlando. And even he won't be attending
the Christian Coalition of Florida's ``God and Country Rally.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Sunshine State, the presidential campaign next month is
largely a no-show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed that the candidates have refused to commit to our
event,'' said Max Karrer, chairman of the state Christian
Coalition, which canceled a rally planned for the same time as the
GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's state conventions have, in the past, been popular and
significant political events. President Clinton credits success at
the 1991 state Democratic convention with giving his campaign the
credibility he needed.
</P>
<P>
   George W.'s dad fought hard to win the state's straw poll in
1979. George Herbert Walker Bush finished third that year, but
eight years later, as vice president, he won.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Gov. Jeb Bush was chairman of the convention and
he worked hard to make sure the straw poll, won by Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole, was a national event. CNN's Larry King hosted a spirited
candidate forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised that none of the other candidates are showing
up,'' Bush said. ``I think they are making a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, 3,300 delegates will hear from a variety of state and
national leaders during the Oct. 8-9, convention in Orlando. ``I
think it will be a very interesting and important convention but I
can certainly understand why some of the delegates might be
disappointed,'' said GOP Chairman Al Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush agreed to come to Florida, where he has raised more than
$3.3 million for his campaign, for about 90 minutes. During that
time he'll give a brief speech, shake a few hands and meet
privately with key supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But the last thing Bush wants is to do that day is be on the
same stage with his political rivals. As a result, plans for Cokie
Roberts to host a candidate forum to be broadcast on ABC were
nixed.
</P>
<P>
   Without a forum, all the other candidates said they would rather
spend their money in Iowa and New Hampshire where real votes will
be cast early next year.

 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a longtime news magazine hack and chronicler of
government at the highest levels, Strobe Talbott was trained to
look for the telling detail, the pivot point that shaped great
lives or great events. In his own life, it was the Cuban missile
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   He was 16, a sophomore at the elite Hotchkiss School in
Connecticut, already a very, very serious young man hurtling toward
a very, very serious adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the headmaster summoned us all into the school
chapel,'' Talbott said in an interview late last week. ``We got
down on our knees and prayed that the world wouldn't blow up.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when his contemporaries were thinking more about dates
and dances and Dairy Queens, Nelson Strobridge Talbott III was
obsessed with the prospect of nuclear annihilation. It became his
occupation and his preoccupation for the next 37 years, as a
student of Russian language and history, then as a Time
correspondent and author of a half dozen books on the dismal
science of nuclear arms control. Since 1993, he has been the
Clinton administration's chief policy maker on Russia, a country
that is today more threatened by corruption and dissolution than by
the prospect of nuclear holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott, because of his expertise on the Soviet Union and its
newly independent fragments, has become the focus of the current
who-lost-Russia debate in Washington and beyond. He has become the
target of critics of President Clinton's policy of financial and
political engagement with Russia as revelations pour forth of
massive money-laundering schemes, the looting of industries
formerly controlled by the state and organized corruption in and
around the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who lost Russia?'' Talbott said, is a bad headline over a very
important story.
</P>
<P>
   The question, he said dismissively, is ``worse than shallow,
worse than simplistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott went on, speaking in rounded paragraphs occasionally
punctuated by the tenting of his fingers or the arching of his
patrician eyebrows: ``I think it is healthy and necessary that we
have an ongoing discussion or debate on the challenges posed not
just by the transformation of Russia, but the transformation of
large parts of the world. One theme of this administration is
dealing with the transition from closed societies to open
societies, not just in Russia, but in Latin America, the Middle
East and much of Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Be patient, he advises, nobody said it was going to be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott's critics _ and they span the political spectrum _
accuse him of a romanticized view of Russia born of his love of
Russian literature and a misplaced faith in America's ability to
shape events in a country that has never known true democracy or
law-based capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   He has an answer that would fill a thick volume but which he
consented to distill to sound-bite length for a poor practitioner
of his former trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Cold War ended a decade ago, we went from a period of
excessive certainty to a much more dynamic, more volatile period.
That has had both positive and negative implications,'' he said,
sitting beneath a blown-up image of two hands hovering above a
chessboard that served as a Time magazine cover for one of his long
essays on arms control negotiations in the 1980s. ``The VCR of
history is on fast forward. That illusion of progress led a lot of
people to expect that the transformation of Russia would take a lot
less time than it in fact will.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my modest suggestions to the world is strategic
patience,'' Talbott continued. ``We have to be calm and steady and
have a clear sense of purpose when that dynamic is discouraging, as
it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott's platinum-plated resume is familiar to those to whom
such things matter _ son of a banker in Shaker Heights, Ohio;
Hotchkiss; Yale; a Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford University;
translator of Nikita Khrushchev's memoirs; a distinguished 21-year
career at Time, and, importantly, Friend of Bill. Clinton was
Talbott's housemate during part of their time at Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott has served at the State Department since the first day
of Clinton's presidency, first as special adviser on the former
Soviet States and since 1994 as deputy secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   He is _ what's the polite term? _ supremely self-assured in his
role, partly because of his breeding, partly because of his record,
partly because of his long relationship with the president. His
wife, Brooke Shearer, is a senior official at the Interior
Department and a longtime friend of the Clintons in her own right.
</P>
<P>
   His interests include classical guitar _ he keeps a handmade
Venezuelan guitar in his private office which he plays only
occasionally and ``badly, alas.'' He runs to work from his home in
Northwest Washington and rides his bicycle on weekends. He plays
squash and entertains official visitors constantly. He said there
was precious little time for quiet reflection and the kind of
writing he used to do. Now it is all speeches and congressional
testimony and memos to his ``bosses'' (like very few officials in
government, he has only two _ the secretary of state and the
president).
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said he intended to remain in government, God and
president willing, until the end of Clinton's term. He said he had
given virtually no thought to what might become of him afterward.
But he is not at all worried about what the future might hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into this job serendipitously,'' he said, not referring
explicitly to his friendship with the president because he doesn't
have to. ``The best thing I can do to prepare for the next phase of
my life is to do this job as well as I can.''

 &HT;    Bradley focuses on health care for uninsured
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The battle for the Democratic presidential
nomination between Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley enters a new phase Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will unveil in Los Angeles a plan to provide health
insurance to the nation's 44 million uninsured, the first of three
domestic policy initiatives designed to give more substance to
Bradley's low-key campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which Bradley says will provide coverage to ``as
many people as possible,'' will sharpen the distinctions between
the two candidates on an issue that is a major theme of both and a
potent issue among Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's health care proposal will also likely bring closer
scrutiny to his record as a senator. With the exception of gun
control and campaign finance reform, Bradley has avoided specifics,
focusing instead on the broad themes of his campaign and
introducing himself to voters as ``the boy from Crystal City,
Missouri, and the senator from New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore announced his own health care plan in Los Angeles earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of providing health care to the uninsured is
particularly problematic for Bradley. In the Senate, Bradley was
not a player in the health care debate in 1994 over President
Clinton's failed plan to provide coverage to all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley served on the Senate Finance Committee, one of two that
wrestled with Clinton's initiative. Bradley sided with Republican
critics on several key aspects of Clinton's plan, opposing a
provision that would have required employers to provide coverage to
employees if the employers didn't develop affordable plans by a
certain date.
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, Bradley remained on the periphery.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1993 and 1994, Bradley was clearly not a leading player
even though he was situated on a committee that could have played a
leading role,'' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families
USA, who promoted the idea of universal coverage during the 1994
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley had intense interests on the committee but they
were mostly financial tax and international fiscal matters,'' said
Sen. John Chafee (R-R.I.), who served with Bradley on the Finance
Committee. ``I don't remember Bill having much to do with health
care matters.''
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, however, Bradley has made affordable
health care a central component of his appeal to working families.
Bradley has portrayed the plight of the nation's 44 million
uninsured as a major failing of a surging economy and, by
implication, a major failing of Clinton administration policies.
</P>
<P>
   He has argued for a phased-in approach that will get as close as
possible to universal coverage. He has promised that his plan will
include some prescription drug benefit and that it will restore the
primacy of physicians _ not ``bureaucrats'' _ in making health care
decisions for patients.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has also promised to attach a cost estimate to his
proposal, something Gore did not do when he unveiled his own,
phased-in approach earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for anybody who's actually going to do
health care to tell the people what it's going to cost,'' Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's proposal will also likely focus most on children and
problems of affordable health insurance for the nation's low-wage,
working families.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Bradley repeatedly advocated and voted to expand
Medicaid coverage to include pregnant women and infants, and
children under 18 who lived at or below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the Senate sponsor of legislation requiring insurers
to offer 48 hours of hospital treatment for mothers having babies,
curtailing the practice of ``drive-thru deliveries.''

REBELS COOL TO COLOMBIA'S U.S.-BACKED PEACE OVERTURES

   BOGOTA, Colombia _ During President Andres Pastrana's first year
in office, critics often described his method of dealing with the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's largest
guerrilla group, as all carrot and no stick. Now, with American
prodding and support, he is adopting a tougher stance _ but finding
the rebel leadership as intractable as ever.
</P>
<P>
   The government's shift in attitude, made evident during
Pastrana's visit to the United States this week, has brought
efforts to end three decades of civil conflict here to a critical
juncture. Though his ultimate objective remains a negotiated
settlement, increased American aid to the Colombian military, which
accounts for the bulk of a 3-year 1.5 billion proposal before
Congress, would significantly strengthen Pastrana's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``For negotiations to succeed,'' Gen. Charles Wilhelm, the chief
of American military forces in Latin America, told a congressional
committee on Sept. 21, ``I'm convinced that the government must
strengthen its negotiating position, and I believe that increased
leverage at the negotiating table can only be gained on Colombia's
battlefields.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana needs such bolstering because last November, shortly
after he took office, he made a Switzerland-sized area of Colombia
a demilitarized zone and handed it over to the rebels, known here
by the Spanish-language acronym FARC. It was a good-faith gesture
meant to bring the insurgents to the negotiating table, and no
concessions were demanded in return, not a cease-fire or even a
mechanism to monitor human rights abuses and other violations.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have been quick to exploit that vagueness and lack of
safeguards. By all accounts except their own, they have abused the
spirit of the government's inducement by stockpiling weapons,
recruiting and training new fighters, killing perceived enemies and
protecting the lucrative drug operations that have moved into the
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred by such activities and the public outrage they have
generated, the government announced early in May that it had
reached an agreement with the rebels on a formal agenda for
negotiations. But the start of such talks has been indefinitely
postponed because Pastrana insisted, belatedly, that an
``international verification commission'' be allowed into the
guerrilla zone.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 16, however, the government backed down from that
demand, saying that it would accept an ``accompaniment
commission.'' But the rebels issued a statement calling even that
offer ``unacceptable'' and criticized the Pastrana administration
in unusually harsh language for what was called its ``warlike
attitude'' in seeking aid from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recognized alliance of Pastrana with the United States to
augment the war in Colombia against the FARC, with the distractive
sophism of jointly combatting drug trafficking, puts in doubt the
government's peace intentions,'' the communique stated. The
document also warned that an alliance with the United States
``could overflow into a civil war with unforeseen circumstance.''
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial, El Espectador, a leading daily newspaper here,
described the guerrilla statement as ``a bucket of cold water'' on
a population waiting for the ``unfreezing'' of peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an old FARC tactic,'' said Armando Borrero, a former
head of the government's national security council. ``Every time
they get something, they ask for more, which makes it hard to have
real negotiations with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Pastrana said this week that Manuel Marulanda, the
main leader of the rebels, had ``signed with his own pen and hand''
a verification agreement in May, but later went back on his word
after the group's National Secretariat refused to support him. The
episode had not been disclosed publicly before, presumably out of
concern for Marulanda's sensibilities and public reaction to
evidence of double-dealing by the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   During a television interview Saturday, however, a rebel
spokesman, Raul Reyes, said the group wanted to resume dialogue
with the government ``as soon as possible,'' adding that ``it is
absolutely clear that the problem with the commission has been
solved.'' He provided no further details, though, saying only that
``we should proceed to negotiations and will not talk any further
about the creation of a commission the FARC does not accept.''
</P>
<P>
   In an essay written just days before his assassination on Sept.
15, Jesus Bejarano, a former government ``peace commissioner'' who
in 1991 helped negotiate an agreement with another rebel group,
said that peace could be achieved only when there was ``a critical
mass of positive facts that make negotiations possible.'' As
examples, he cited the cases of El Salvador and Guatemala, where
fighting between government and rebels dragged on for years.
</P>
<P>
   For such a ``critical mass'' to be achieved here, though, the
government may have to transform a weakness into a strength. The
absence of a cease-fire has worked primarily to the advantage of
the rebels so far. But as Alfredo Rangel, another prominent
political analyst here, noted, it also offers the government an
opportunity ``to strengthen the dissuasive capacity of the armed
forces, so as to convince the guerrillas that a military victory is
impossible.''

BUSH SNUBS GOP'S ORGANIZATIONAL ARM IN CALIFORNIA TO RUN CAMPAIGN
HIS WAY IN DELEGATE_RICH STATE
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CRAGG HINES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ In an echo of internecine Republican
skirmishing back home in Texas, Gov. George W. Bush has overcome
the archconservative leadership of the GOP in California, a
potentially decisive state in his campaign for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   After winning a midsummer fight over rules for next March's
primary in the nation's most populous state, Bush and his top
strategists in Austin and the Golden State have decided to largely
ignore the conservative diehards who control the struggling, broke
California party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has run up a strong lead in polling, fund-raising and
endorsements in California, stiffed the state Republican convention
here this weekend. It was the second time this year he had refused
to appear at the gathering of rightwing activists. He instead
attended a home-schoolers event and a GOP Hispanic dinner in
Washington on Friday and spent the weekend at the Ryder Cup golf
competition in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Seeming to make his snub of the convention more obvious, Bush
will campaign in California later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looking forward to coming out here and building upon his
grass-roots support,'' said the Bush campaign's California
spokeswoman, Margita Thompson. ``He's going to go meet with them in
their own towns around the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush's absence was criticized by nomination rival Steve
Forbes, the multimillionaire magazine publisher seeking to become
the more conservative alternative to the front-runner, moderates
defended the governor's decision to skip the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he really had any alternative,'' said Bob
Larkin, a Simi Valley insurance agent who chairs the centrist
California Congress of Republicans. The congress held a rump
session across the street from the official convention. ``Why
should he show up to support folks who tried to slap at him?''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin referred to the move last June by California Republican
Chairman John McGraw and the state party's executive committee to
ditch the statewide winner-take-all presidential nominating primary
in favor of a system that would have considered a candidate's
showing in each of the state's 52 U.S. House districts. The move
was seen by Bush strategists as an attempt to weaken the
front-runner's hand and provide an opportunity for more
conservative candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters, citing legal requirements, forced McGraw to
seek legislative approval of the change, which was not obtained
before the national party's July 1 deadline for submitting final
rules for 2000 delegate-selection plans.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush backers hoped the governor and his campaign operatives
in California would step up the fight against McGraw, an
anti-abortion ideologue who has declared that ``killing our babies
(is the) issue of the century. Cutting taxes or any other issue
pales in comparison.'' Some participants in the rump convention
wore stickers reading ``Abort McGraw.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the fight about primary rules complete, the Bush forces
have decided that the party organization is largely irrelevant to
its California campaign, which already has more important assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the winner-take-all primary. We've got the vast support
of Republicans in the (California) legislature. We've got the vast
support of Republicans in the congressional delegation. We've got
the enthusiastic support of Republican fund-raisers in the state.
We get a wild response whenever the governor is out there,'' said a
top Bush adviser. ``We don't need to worry about taming anything.
We're in control of our destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush strategist's view is shared by independent analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming more and more apparent that as irrelevant as the
(Republican) party has become in the state, the hard-right element
is becoming even more irrelevant,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political scientist at the Claremont Graduate University.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's fights with the California party's hard-right hierarchy
is reminiscent of his tussles with a similar element in the Texas
GOP, including criticism of the governor by former state Chairman
Tom Pauken and Bush's open feud with conservative Republicans on
the state Board of Education. Bush also spoke out for more
tolerance in a dispute between the state party officials and the
gay Log Cabin Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw attempted in several sessions with reporters during the
weekend to gloss over any past disagreements with the Bush
campaign, a sentiment also voiced by some Bush campaign leaders in
California, including state co-chairman Mike Schroeder, immediate
past chief of the state GOP.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw said that despite continued agitation from his
conservative allies he considered the winner-take-all issue closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do nothing to jeopardize our delegation'' to the
Republican National Convention next summer in Philadelphia, McGraw
said.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw acknowledged that Bush ``seems to be playing very well''
in California and said he planned to see the governor this week
when Bush campaigns in Redwood City, near McGraw's home in the
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's bulging campaign treasury will allow him to fund a major
television advertising campaign leading up the California primary,
``and that speaks louder than the squeals of the hard right,''
Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   The state party may also find itself soon financially beholden
to Bush, who reportedly has agreed to star at two fund-raising
events for the California GOP, which is currently in the hole. In
June 30 filings, the party had debts of $311,000 and only $131,500
in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   An insider said the party, which lost the governorship last
November to a Democrat for the first time in 16 years, has failed
to attract its usual financial support from key donors _ many of
whom are aligned with Bush and were irritated by McGraw's move
against the winner-take-all primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys may loosen up if Bush is the main attraction at a
party fund-raiser,'' a key Republican official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that a message or is that a message?'' said Jeffe. She also
predicted that ``a Bush person will be sitting on top of the money
bag'' when it arrives at the state party headquarters. In fact,
former state GOP chairman Schroeder is expected to be the
go-between on how the money should be allocated.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Bush is conservative and opposes abortion, it is not
the focus of his campaign and he has attracted support of more
moderate California Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to make us a united party, and our state
leadership isn't interested in that,'' said Victoria Bull of
Pasadena, Calif., a Republicans for Choice leader who attended the
rump convention.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory A. Zlotnick of Mountain View, chairman of the moderate
California Republican League, said the state party currently is run
by ``people more dedicated to ideological purity than they are to
winning elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent statewide survey by the nonpartisan Public
Policy Institute of California found that on an open primary
ballot, like the one that will face voters March 7, Bush was tied
with Vice President Al Gore, the leader for the Democratic
nomination, at 27 percent. The next Republican contender was former
Cabinet official Elizabeth Dole at 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If that were the primary result, Bush could claim the entire
giant California delegation to the Republican National Convention _
about one-fifth of the votes needed to secure the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential contenders Forbes, Dole and former
diplomat Alan Keyes addressed the state convention over the
weekend, with Keyes making the most direct assault on Bush, whom he
labeled an ``unprincipled equivocator.''
</P>
<P>
   The Public Policy Institute survey earlier this month found that
in the general election, Bush topped Gore 49-44 percent and that
the governor ran ahead of the other Democratic contender, former
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, 51-38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, a Democrat, carried California in the last
two national elections, and his party rarely has won the presidency
without being victorious in the state.

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Jelena Kovacevic, 25, wants change so
badly she is nearly in tears. She's afraid of the winter, afraid of
her grandparents dying from lack of medicine, afraid of the future,
afraid that she will never live in a Serbia in which she will want
to bear a child.
</P>
<P>
   A painter and graphic artist, she goes nightly to the opposition
demonstrations in Novi Sad seeking the ouster of President Slobodan
Milosevic, but she does not believe that they will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to the rallies because I want something good to happen in
this country, so I can't stay at home. But I don't go because I
support the opposition, either,'' she said, twisting her fingers
around her three earrings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so tired, tired of everything,'' she said.
``Normally, I'm a person with a lot of energy, but I don't feel it
now. I don't see the person in the opposition who can lead the
Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kovacevic's despair is widely shared among the tens of
thousands, young and old, who have turned out for Serbia's first
week of rallies to try to oust the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   It is a despair shared, privately, by opposition officials and
organizers, who are trying to swallow down their disappointment in
their own people.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 80,000 people across Serbia turned out last Tuesday,
but since then the numbers have, if anything, been shrinking. The
enthusiasm is palpable in Novi Sad, 90 minutes north of Belgrade,
and numbers are back up to 30,000 in the capital now that
demonstrators have been asked to march instead of simply listen to
speeches, but they are down in other Serbian cities.
</P>
<P>
   In a country of nearly 11 million people, the turnout is not
even close to a politically definitive figure, let alone to the 2
million demonstrators that the Democratic Party leader, Zoran
Djindjic, believes will be necessary to get the Milosevic
government to crack. And the behavior of the demonstrators is
extraordinarily _ and undramatically _ polite.
</P>
<P>
   The indisputable fact about the opposition is its division:
Djindjic and the Alliance for Change, a coalition of smaller
parties, have taken a path of daily rallies opposed by the largest,
notionally opposition party, the Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk
Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Don Quixote against the windmills,'' said Vesna, who
asked that her last name not be used because she works for an
international organization. ``However much we'd like to see
Milosevic fall, to see him hanging with his wife from a lamppost in
Terazije Square, like Mussolini, on the other hand'' _ she paused,
lifting up her arms, turning her palms toward her face _ ``the
power is still in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   People are tired and afraid of losing what little is left to
them, including their jobs, Vesna said. ``From the end of the war
until now, energy has been dissipated by the war, the bombing, the
shortages of everything. And the opposition dissipates energy, too,
with empty rallies, with their squabbling and their fight for
supremacy.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic and Djindjic, former allies in the Zajedno, or
Together, coalition that led 88 days of opposition demonstrations
in the winter of 1996-97, not so casually despise each other.
Draskovic, who now controls Belgrade and its television station,
Studio B, says that the Alliance strategy is all wrong, that street
pressure will not bring down Milosevic but should be used to demand
fair and early elections, even if Milosevic keeps his post.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic Party officials and many rally goers believe that
Draskovic simply wants to destroy Djindjic and become the sole
leader of the opposition, and that his position is part of a deal
with Milosevic to keep each other in power.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Vesna believes that Draskovic is hopelessly compromised by his
desire to keep Belgrade, its money and privilege, and that he
cannot be considered a member of the opposition at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is true that the revolution eats its own children,''
she said. ``Draskovic chooses not to join these rallies, and he is
doing all he can to kill them.'' Studio B has taken a dismissive
line toward the rallies, reporting them but underestimating
turnout, much like state television.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Vuk is a red bandit now,'' said Jovan Bandin, using a
description commonly attached to Milosevic and his allies. Bandin,
a portly, bearded businessman who says he will attend rallies until
the end, said he liked Draskovic three years ago, ``but he's
Slobo's man now. He's doing everything he can to stop real
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Bandin, who imports Timex watches and Herbalife, a nutritional
supplement, says: ``I have a house and cars. I don't need anything.
But what I need I don't have, and that's freedom _ the freedom to
live and travel.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Bandin is also highly critical of the West's effort to drive
Milosevic into a corner by indicting him for war crimes, giving him
no option but to turn and fight for his position. `` Without an
exit, he won't go, not without a real battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Mina, 21, an economics student, has come to the rallies without
much real hope. Asked why, she said bitterly: ``Milosevic has
smashed my hopes. But the largest blame for that belongs to the
opposition parties. They have no clear line, they just wait to see
what Milosevic will give them, and everyone knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   But she conceded that the opposition has real problems of
finances and lack of media access, too. For instance, cardboard
masks of Milosevic's face with a red line through it, so popular at
the first rally, had disappeared by the second day. The Alliance
had money to print only 12,000 of them.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With Draskovic's Studio B essentially unsympathetic to the
rallies, it is difficult for Djindjic to answer the carefully honed
criticisms of the state television that has been the mainstay of
Milosevic's 12-year rule of Yugoslavia. Like all good propaganda,
reports over the state news media play on real issues: there was a
war here, NATO did bomb and take over Kosovo, and ordinary
civilians died.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of the start of the bombing, in March, Djindjic told
The New York Times that the democratic opposition would be the
first victim of NATO's war against Milosevic. And it remains very
awkward for the political opposition to push for Western reforms
and the ouster of Milosevic with the visible support _ moral and
financial _ of those who bombed for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, opposition officials say, NATO not only failed
to finish off Milosevic, but it also has failed to protect the
multiethnic character of Kosovo. By letting even innocent Serbs be
driven from a province that remains a sovereign part of Yugoslavia,
NATO has allowed Milosevic to justify fighting the war, however
unwinnable, by pointing to its consequences for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kovacevic, the Novi Sad artist, sees the opposition as part
of the ``collateral damage'' of the NATO bombing war, caught
between patriotism and its desire to push for Western-style
democratic change. She has done a series of ``collateral art'' and
distributed it on her web page (http://www.surf.to/jelena),
including a graphic of Sisyphus, eternally trying to climb his
mountain with a huge red Communist star still embedded in his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition had its chance to do something and failed
everyone,'' she said. ``And now, when it's the last chance to do
something, when Milosevic is weaker, they're quarreling among
themselves. You know people are afraid when they start to
quarrel,'' she said. ``People lose their faith and trust in them,
and that's why the demonstrations have lost strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kovacevic is trying without much success to pull money
together to attend art school in America, but she also feels guilty
about wanting to leave her family and friends before a winter that
everyone knows will be difficult, with shortages of electricity and
heat. But she doubts that winter will be a great ally to the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just adds to this collective depression,'' she said.
``Imagine people in New York without enough electricity and heat,
without confidence in the future, without knowing what will happen
tomorrow to basic parts of life. Will there be medicine? Will my
computer be dead without electricity? This uncertainty translates
into apathy, not action.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kovacevic was 6 when Tito died in May 1980 after 35 years as
the unquestioned leader of the old Communist Yugoslavia. ``Everyone
cried and I couldn't understand it,'' she said. ``But since then
I've lived in so many states, in so many Yugoslavias, each one
smaller than the last, but for 10 years with the same leader _
that's the worst thing of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of her friends have joined the great exodus of young people
from Yugoslavia, to live and work abroad. ``They call or e-mail me
and ask how am I. I can't answer _ things just get worse and worse.
And when they talk about visiting, I tell them not to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kovacevic toyed with her earrings again, finished a coffee
and prepared to wander out to another rally. ``After the war, I
really thought Milosevic would be gone in a few days,'' she said.
``But now he seems stronger.''

   Bidding War Opens for British Bank
</P>
<P>
   Royal Bank of Scotland Group is said to be preparing a
counteroffer for National Westminster Bank. The takeover offer,
expected as soon as Monday, would be about 25 billion pounds, or
about $41 billion, according to executives briefed on the plan.
That would be 3 billion pounds more than a rival, the Bank of
Scotland, offered in a hostile bid for National Westminster on
Friday.

<P>
   Paloma O'Riley, co-founder of the Cassandra Project, an
Internet-based clearinghouse for potential Year 2000 computer
threats, has resigned as the service's research director, saying
that people are losing interest in efforts to organize
neighborhoods and communities. Her activism brought invitations to
testify before Congress and made her a leader in the pursuit of
grass-roots solutions.

   Penney Begins Fall Fashion Push

   One of the largest campaigns of the fall fashion season comes
from J.C. Penney Co., which is seeking to reposition itself as a
fashion leader. Trade publications estimated spending for the
campaign at $35 million. The new branding effort, which began last
month, will include 23 commercials that were created by Temerlin
McClain in Irving, Texas.

   Contender Emerges at Miami Herald
</P>
<P>
   The four-month search for a new executive editor at The Miami
Herald is almost over, and Robert Rivard, editor and senior vice
president of The San Antonio Express News, is the leading candidate
for the job, according to one Knight Ridder executive, who asked
not to be identified. The Herald's publisher said other candidates
were still under consideration. The new editor will inherit a
newsroom bolstered by a 1999 Pulitzer Prize for investigative
reporting but bruised by circulation declines.

   Online Sales, Real-World Shipping
</P>
<P>
   Order fulfillment remains the most important issue facing the
e-commerce industry. Picking, packing and shipping products was
difficult enough in recent years for Internet retailers who had no
experience in such matters. But with consumers' expectations rising
and e-commerce companies preparing to ship a wider array of
merchandise to customers this holiday season, distribution issues
now loom even larger than before.

WORLD BANK CHIEF TO BE RENOMINATED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has decided to renominate James
D. Wolfensohn as president of the World Bank, administration
officials said Sunday, _ a political victory for the former
investment banker who openly split with the administration over its
early handling of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers informed finance ministers
of the other major industrial nations of the decision on Saturday,
telling them that ``Jim Wolfensohn has done an extraordinary job of
bringing energy and passion to the bank's crucial development
mission.'' Wolfensohn is in the midst of restructuring the bank,
whose mission is to combat poverty around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997 and early 1998, Wolfensohn openly criticized both
the Treasury and the World Bank's sister institution, the
International Monetary Fund, for designing national bailouts in
Asia that paid too little attention to hardships that would result
for the poorest residents of Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea and
other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue packages, he contended, were too skewed toward aiding
banks and international lenders. But in recent months he has
smoothed over relations with the administration, and officials say
there was no real debate about his reappointment, which is likely
to be announced formally on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, speaking at the annual meetings of the World Bank and
the IMF, Wolfensohn said that while Asia is recovering, ``the
economic situation is especially difficult in Latin America,'' and
that ``we will still be going backward rather than forward in the
fight to reduce global poverty.''

SURGING AMERICANS PRODUCE HIGHEST RYDER   TV RATINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The 33d Ryder Cup produced not only the
greatest comeback in its history, but also its highest ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's final-day numbers are expected to be even higher than
those achieved Saturday, when the Europeans finished with a 4-point
lead. The second day of action earned a 4.9 rating and 14 share in
the overnight survey of 43 markets.
</P>
<P>
   Boston viewers gave NBC's Channel 7 a 7.2 rating and 21 share.
Those numbers are particularly significant because the network
began its 10 1/2-hour day at 7:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The highest rating achieved in a single market occurred in West
Palm Beach, with a 9.2 rating. Hartford, Conn. pulled a 6.3 and
Providence, R.I. had a 7.3.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's production was wonderful Sunday, balancing informative
profiles and graphics with the action. And, of course, there was
Johnny Miller, the best analyst of any sport. He is so frank,
honest, and knowledgeable that he is one of the rare analysts who
commands attention from the most sensitive of listeners _
professional golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Miller so dogged Justin Leonard's woeful performance on Saturday
that Davis Love told Jim Gray, ``He didn't believe in us.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was just calling it as he saw it. With Sergio Garcia on a
roll, Miller said that Jim Furyk was an underdog in Sunday's match.
Furyk beat Garcia, 4 and 3, and said, ``I didn't feel like I was an
underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Leonard took a shot at Miller. ``It's a good thing I didn't
go home,'' Leonard said. Miller had suggested on Saturday that
Leonard ``find a shovel, dig a hole, and get in it.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol rolled the dice with his
purchase of the Ryder Cup rights back in 1991. NBC lost money that
year but stuck with it, and recently spent more than $10 million to
secure the television rights the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol defended his decision not to have a permanent scoreboard
on screen and said that viewers heard the total score every three
or four minutes. He was correct. Ebersol also pointed out that
showing the total score would have required a large graphic, which
would prevented viewers from seeing live action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we live in a time of instant gratification,'' Ebersol
said. ``But I'd like to think of television as settling people
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol also defended Miller, saying the analyst is loyal to his
viewers first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Azinger made the same criticisms against Miller after the
1991 Ryder Cup,'' Ebersol said. ``Miller has developed a thick skin
ever since then. But like Johnny has said countless times before,
he gives his loyalty to the viewer at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even Ebersol could have predicted the succces of the Ryder
Cup. ``This event gives the PGA what it has been looking for _ a
fifth major,'' Ebersol said.

MOTIVATIONAL MEEETING PULLED AMERICANS TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Jim Furyk, after absorbing a 3-and-2 loss
with partner Mark O'Meara to Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood
Saturday morning, never took his clubs out of the bag for the
four-ball competition.
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard at the end of the day said it all: Europe 10, USA
6. Neither development did much for Furyk's mood. ``I was a little
down when I left the golf course,'' recalled Furyk after Sunday's
stunning Ryder Cup victory at The Country Club. ``I stayed here
extra long. But when I heard the guys in our talk Saturday night, I
knew we could win.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``talk,'' orchestrated by captain Ben Crenshaw, included a
video of well-wishes and highlights of the players' achievements
before the team left the clubhouse for their hotel. It was a
never-say-die exhortation that was soon echoed by every team member
and by Governor George W. Bush of Texas, who even made reference to
the Alamo and the willingness to fight to the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben kept saying, `We can do this. I've got a good feeling
about it.' '' said Davis Love. ``Today, we came out and did what he
asked us to do. The mood was great. Everybody spoke. It was hard to
believe. Every time anybody said whether we win or lose, somebody
would stop them and say, `Wait a minute, we're going to win.' ''
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, at the meeting, wanted to put something else to
rest: The perception that he was approaching the Ryder Cup
selfishly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I was happy to be here,'' said Duval, who set the tone
early by wiping out Jesper Parnevik (5 and 4), a thorn in the US
side until Sunday. ``I was sick and tired of everyone saying we
weren't a team. I was upset with what I had interpreted as a
misrepresentation at times. I said I think we're better (than the
European team) and let's go show it and let's go kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, added Steve Pate, the meeting was a needed
reminder to the Americans that they hadn't played poorly. ``It was
just that the European team had played unbelievably well,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't a players-only meeting, said Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all played a part in it,'' said Woods. ``All the players,
wives, girlfriends, assistant captains. It was a great meeting. It
was a great night. We shared what we thought. It was a very
beautiful evening.''
</P>
<P>
   One that left Hal Sutton with ``no doubt in my mind leaving it
that we all felt we could go out and make a real run at this
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the Bush reference about the man at the Alamo who
knew he wasn't going to make it, this time the Americans survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might not be soldiers who fight in wars,'' said Phil
Mickelson, ``but this was somthing of its own and we needed to
fight as if we were.''
</P>
<P>
   And the fight talk helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all went around the room and all 12 players spoke,'' said
Love. ``I can't believe how together these 12 players were.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the flashpoint, Crenshaw said at Sunday night's press
conference, ``for a friendship and a bond that was unbreakable.''

NEW MEDICARE HANDBOOKS ARE DESIGNED TO END CONFUSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBIN TONER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a vast public education campaign, the biggest in
the 34-year history of Medicare, the federal government is mailing
handbooks to 39 million Medicare beneficiaries this month to try to
guide them through the increasingly complicated world of health
care.
</P>
<P>
   Backed up by a new toll-free telephone service, an expanding
Internet site (www.medicare.gov) and outreach efforts with more
than 200 local and national groups, the new campaign is intended to
aid an aging population that, experts say, is often ill equipped to
handle the brave new world of health-care choices envisioned by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy-Ann DeParle, the administrator of the Health Care
Financing Administration, which oversees Medicare, has said that
this may be the ``biggest peacetime education program the federal
government has ever undertaken.''
</P>
<P>
   But the challenge facing this new campaign, which was delayed
last year for more research, is daunting. Many health planners and
lawmakers on Capitol Hill dream of a nation of savvy elderly
consumers taking advantage of a competitive marketplace that offers
them a choice of health plans. But so far, many experts say, there
is significant confusion among the elderly about the costs and
benefits of these choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a managed-care basher,'' said Shoshanna Sofaer, a
professor of health-care policy at Baruch College of the City
University of New York, who is advising the federal government on
its education efforts. ``But I'm saying we really do have to
recognize that it's going to be difficult and take a while for
people to get this stuff. And for a significant percentage, they're
never going to get it, because they're cognitively impaired,
they're too frail, or they just don't have the energy to invest in
understanding these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it the complexity factor, or what happens when political
theory (choice is good) collides with reality (choice is
confusing).
</P>
<P>
   Carol Cronin, director of beneficiary services for Medicare,
estimates that 70 percent of the Medicare recipients now can choose
between traditional Medicare and at least one HMO. About 16 percent
are in an HMO.
</P>
<P>
   And while the market has been in some turmoil in the past few
years, with the managed-care industry complaining that the
government pays it too little for Medicare beneficiaries, and with
many HMOs leaving the program, more and more of the nation's
elderly are expected to end up in HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Help lines, like the Medicare Rights Center in New York, say
they are flooded with calls from older Americans, or their
frustrated sons and daughters, trying to determine which
health-care plan is best for them. ``It's all incredibly
complicated not only for seniors but for everyone, including me,''
said Diane Archer at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven Medicare beneficiaries, five in HMOs and six in
traditional Medicare, assembled at the John Booth Senior Center in
Baltimore last week and offered a glimpse of life on the front
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Dominiak, 79, a retired credit investigator, said she had
looked at the new Medicare guide and understood some of it, but
confessed: ``I don't understand managed care at all. It's like
reading Greek.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine McGurrin, a 79-year-old retired real estate agent who
is happily enrolled in an HMO, said she thought the guide would
help in making decisions, but added that she also relied on
relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk to other women: `Where do you go?''' Ms. McGurrin
said. ``You get five or six people you talk to, maybe three of four
of them say one thing, it more or less points you in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Linz, a 72-year-old retired electrician from General
Motors, said he got a lot of information about health care from
retiree meetings at his old workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agreed that health care had become more complicated.
Most had war stories about being trapped in voice-mail systems
trying to get answers. ``Blue Cross Blue Shield, if you live long
enough to get through to a human being, they'll answer questions,''
Mrs. Dominiak said. ``You got to push this, and push that.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Mirabile, a 79-year-old retired sewing-machine operator,
said she still did not understand some of her bills. She added with
a rueful laugh, ``I just pay them.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Medicare guide, ``Medicare &AMP; You 2000,'' is part of an
information campaign mandated by Congress in the 1997 legislation
that was intended to open the Medicare market to even more kinds of
health plans than now exist. The estimated cost of the education
effort in this fiscal year is $133 million.
</P>
<P>
   The guides are the result of months of market testing, focus
groups, expert reviews and survey research, much of which
discovered that Medicare beneficiaries have only a sketchy
understanding of the basic Medicare program, let alone the new
managed-care choices.
</P>
<P>
   Focus-group studies done for the Kaiser Family Foundation, a
health research group, show that even many of the elderly who are
already in HMOs ``don't understand the rules that govern their
care,'' said Tricia Neuman, a Kaiser analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Focus groups also show that their adult sons and daughters are
``very angry over how confusing the program is,'' Michael Perry, a
pollster, said. Those who counsel older Americans say they
sometimes do not understand the tradeoffs they make _ for example,
getting prescription-drug coverage by joining an HMO but giving up
a full choice of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making it more complicated for people, and we're also
making it more consequential,'' Ms. Sofaer said. One of the
messages in the new Medicare campaign is that people do not have to
choose. ``If you are happy with the way you get your health care
now, you don't have to do anything,'' says a recorded voice on the
Medicare toll-free line. Live counselors are available during work
hours Monday through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The new Medicare guide, which is produced in 26 regional
versions and is being mailed to 32 million households, features
basic information on what the traditional program covers, as well
as the options for Medigap insurance to supplement it, and the
basics on managed-care plans.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes information on the managed-care plans available
in a beneficiary's region, as well as data on the quality of the
plans _ for example, consumer ratings of how well the doctors
communicate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It includes a three-page summary at the front, beginning with
``Welcome to Medicare &AMP; You!'' which is an attempt to lead the
beneficiary through the basics in simple language. But insurance is
inherently difficult, and before long, the handbook is in the
thicket of benefit periods and Part A and Part B.
</P>
<P>
   It describes the choice between traditional Medicare and
managed-care plans (HMOs), which is politically fraught on Capitol
Hill, this way: ``In most plans, you can only go to doctors,
specialists, or hospitals on the plan's list. Plans must cover all
Medicare Part A and Part B health care. Some plans cover extras,
like prescription drugs. Your costs may be lower than in the
Original Medicare plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the handbook, more information is available on the
Internet, although Ms. Cronin acknowledged that it was more likely
to be used by relatives, friends and state insurance counselors
than by older people themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of managed care contend that the market will work only
when consumers have a wealth of information upon which to base
their decision. But Bob Blendon, an expert on public attitudes and
health at Harvard, said studies showed that older Americans are
much less likely than younger people to make consumer decisions on
the basis of statistical data.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Dr. Lee Newcomber, senior vice president for health
policy at United Healthcare, which has a large Medicare business,
said, ``You really have to do a face-to-face conversation with a
senior to really help them through it.'' Once enrolled at his
company, elderly beneficiaries are assigned to a personal service
representative ``so they call the same person whenever they have a
question,'' he added.

<P>
   To a large extent, experts say, this confusion will be eased by
time, as more and more of the people entering Medicare have
experienced managed care in their working lifetimes. Already, said
Ms. Cronin, newer retirees have less of an information gap, ``so,
in effect, we have two generations within this current Medicare
population.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, calls to the toll-free lines, which are staffed
in Iowa and Wisconsin, are climbing. ``It's up to about 17,000 to
20,000 a week, and the handbook is just starting to arrive,'' Ms.
Cronin said last week.

   DILI, Indonesia _ For Domingos Goncalves, the day of terror
began two hours before dawn, as she crouched on the floor of her
bedroom, praying that she would survive the attack that she knew
was coming.
</P>
<P>
   For the armed men who were shouting in the alleyways, outside
her house, the day began with a call for more gasoline as they
moved methodically through the neighborhood, burning one house
after another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard one commander say, `OK, some elements go to buy
gasoline,'' said Miss Goncalves, 30, a lay worker in a Roman
Catholic Church. ``Then everybody gather in front of the police
station.'''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all her neighbors had already fled the campaign of terror
and destruction that began after the news on Sept. 4 that the
people of East Timor had voted for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Goncalves said people had told her to run. ``But because my
mother is crippled from rheumatism, my brother and I stayed with
her.''
</P>
<P>
   What the family witnessed _ the destruction of their home and
the killing of Miss Goncalves' brother _ provides a look inside an
extraordinary three-week surge of violence in which irregular
militias supported by the Indonesian military appeared to try to
annihilate the people of an entire territory.
</P>
<P>
   In a land where almost everybody seems to know everybody else,
the violence as witnessed by the Goncalves family was as personal
as it was political.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Goncalves' brother, Afonso, for instance, seems to have
died not only because of his pro-independence views but also
because of his mental retardation and a family feud in which a
niece had eloped with a member of a militia group.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, his death involved vengeance, as the Indonesian
army, defeated in its attempt to subdue the territory it invaded in
1975, set out to ensure that a free East Timor would have to build
a new country from nothing.
</P>
<P>
   For two days the Goncalves family hid in their house, listening
to the shouts, the shooting, the screams of fear, the busy sounds
of motorcycles and trucks, the roar of fires as the destruction
drew nearer.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all their neighbors were gone. The houses around them
were empty. In their own home, Miss Goncalves said, the only sound
was their own breathing and their whispered prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very frightened,'' she said. ``I prepared myself to
die.''
</P>
<P>
   On the third day, her family's turn came.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the leader shouting, `Burn that house, burn this
house,''' Miss Goncalves said. ```This house' meant our house. They
came on motorcycles, hitting at things with rifle butts and sticks,
hitting houses and fences, breaking windows, shooting their guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Goncalves fled to a thicket of mango and papaya trees
behind the house. She watched through the bushes as a man wearing
the black T-shirt of a militia group called Aitarak and carrying a
military-issue automatic rifle kicked down the door.
</P>
<P>
   What she heard was more terrifying than what she could see, Miss
Goncalves said. ``I heard a woman screaming,'' she said. ``I tried
to tell if it was the screaming of my mother. I was sure that she
and my brother were being killed.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, her mother, Martinha Goncalves, 70, picks up the
story as she sits in a shack in a dry river bed that serves as a
camp ground for many of Dili's homeless people. Her mind has faded
with age, and a second daughter, Filomena Soares, 41, helps her.
</P>
<P>
   When the armed men burst into the house, Mrs. Goncalves said,
she sat staring at them, immobile on her bed. Her son, who was 37,
hid behind a door. The armed men, busy with their looting and
vandalism, paid no attention to them.
</P>
<P>
   Was she afraid?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel anything,'' Mrs. Goncalves said. ``But Afonso
was afraid because he worried about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Were there many men in her house?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot. But I have trouble with my memory. The person who can
tell you the whole story is Afonso. But Afonso is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, before the men returned to burn the house, her son found
a transport tricycle and he and his mother moved to the home of
friends on the other side of Dili, Mrs. Soares said.
</P>
<P>
   It was five days before three armed men, one wearing an army
uniform, found Afonso there and killed him.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mrs. Soares' husband they were looking for, she said,
because of his reputation as a strong supporter of independence.
When word came that they were on their way, he ran.
</P>
<P>
   But Afonso, always slow to react and determined not to leave his
mother, was at the house when they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   They saw him and said, ``People like Afonso we have to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   What this meant, Mrs. Soares said, was that the armed men were
determined to kill a member of a family that had strongly supported
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came filled with fury and they were ready to kill
anybody,'' she said. ``If Afonso had run, they would have killed
our mother.''
</P>
<P>
   It was noon, said a neighbor, Simeao da Cruz Ribeiro, 59, when
the three men walked up to the house. Everybody knew who they were:
two brothers and an uncle who belonged to a militia group and who
hated the Goncalves family.
</P>
<P>
   The family feud dated back to last year, when Mrs. Soares'
foster daughter, Octaviana, 22, fell in love and ran off with
another member of the family who had arrived now to kill her
brother. The Goncalves family had objected to the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started to beat Afonso with their rifle butts,'' Ribeiro
said. ``He put his hands over his head and began to scream. Then
they shot Afonso between the legs and he fell onto his face. He
crawled on the ground to a tree and he lay on his back at the foot
of the tree, looking at the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Ribeiro said his 19-year-old daughter, Siria Brigida, ran over
to him. ``Uncle Afonso, Uncle Afonso,'' she called.
</P>
<P>
   He lifted his head and repeated the same phrase twice before he
died: ``Look after my mother. Look after my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors buried him in front of their house in a grave
marked with small stones and strewn with red and purple flowers.
They wrote his name on a piece of wood because they could not find,
anywhere in this ravaged city, a hammer and nails to build a cross.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Baseball fans may be caught up with the home-run race
between Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire, but if all goes according to
plan, opera buffs will be cheering Monday night as the tireless
tenor Placido Domingo hits a few high notes into the top balcony of
the Metropolitan Opera House and breaks an operatic record that has
stood longer than Babe Ruth's 60-homer season did.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Opera opens its season Monday night with a
popular double bill: Mascagni's ``Cavalleria Rusticana'' and
Leoncavallo's ``Pagliacci.'' And for the 18th time in his career
Domingo will star in a Met opening-night performance, surpassing
Enrico Caruso's tally of 17. To drive home the point, it would
seem, Domingo is setting the record by singing Canio in
``Pagliacci,'' Caruso's signature role.
</P>
<P>
   Caruso sang his 17 opening nights during just 18 seasons, from
his Met debut as the Duke in Verdi's ``Rigoletto'' in 1903 through
1920 with his portrayal of Eleazar in an opera he championed, ``La
Juive'' by Halevy. This near-consecutive streak indicates how
Caruso dominated his era. Had he not died of pleurisy at 48 in 1921
he would have no doubt added to his total.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo's 18th opening night comes as he begins his 31st season
with the Met. His first opening night was in 1971 with the title
role in Verdi's ``Don Carlo.'' As he relaxed recently in his
dressing room at the Met after a rehearsal for ``Pagliacci,''
looking comfortable in a long silk bathrobe, Domingo, 58, seemed as
energetic and ambitious as ever.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had always assumed that Caruso's record would never
be topped. ``But when I was in my 11th or 12th opening night
somebody asked me, `Do you realize how close you are to the number
of times Caruso opened the Met season?' What can I tell you? I
started to think maybe I can do it.'' For now he has no plans to
stop at 18, provided the Met continues to offer the dates, and his
voice holds out.
</P>
<P>
   Vocal excellence and popularity are hardly the only factors that
go into a singer's being so honored. Forced to choose, some artists
might prefer other Met plums, like being cast in a new production
or a television broadcast. Opening nights have long been ritzy
social events for patrons and indispensable fund-raisers for the
company. On Monday night some 600 guests in formal finery who have
paid $2,000 or $2,500 a seat are to attend the opera, which will be
followed by a dinner in the Met's Grand Tier. Remaining tickets
sold for between $75 and $850. The 3,700-seat house is sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, opening night is not the night we would normally
make a major artistic statement,'' the Met's general manager,
Joseph Volpe, said recently. ``If we can make some statement, have
the public on board and also honor a great singer, that is the
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prestige of opening night at the Met is something
almost every singer wants, probably more so than opening at La
Scala, the Paris Opera or Covent Garden. It is not just Domingo's
celebrated voice that has enabled him to sing so many first nights.
Stamina, loyalty to the company and wide-ranging repertory have
been just as important.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's performance will be his 565th at the Met
(including his appearances as a conductor). This represents a
significant share of his total performances, now approaching 2,900.
But Caruso's career was even more focused on the Met. In 18 Met
seasons he sang 607 performances _ at a time when a season
typically lasted less than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with these two vocal sluggers, Luciano Pavarotti's
opening-night tally of seven seems modest. He has been central to
the Met's planning and enduringly popular for 30 years. But he has
less stamina and a narrower repertory than Domingo, whose roles on
opening nights alone range stylistically through Verdi's Otello,
Wagner's Lohengrin and Siegfried, Offenbach's Hoffmann and
Saint-Saens' Samson.
</P>
<P>
   The suave, velvet-voiced Italian baritone Ezio Pinza is in third
place with nine opening-night performances during a career that
went from 1926 to 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The female record holder? The incomparable Rosa Ponselle? No,
only five. Hers was a short career. The beloved Lucrezia Bori? Only
four. Surely Renata Tebaldi is up there? Surprisingly, no. She had
only two: a 1958 ``Tosca'' and a 1968 ``Adriana Lecouvreur.''
</P>
<P>
   The top female of opening nights is Margarete Matzenauer, the
Romanian-born soprano, later a contralto. During a loyal 19-year
Met career through the 1920s she performed in eight opening nights
as Verdi's Amneris and Ulrica, Saint-Saens' Dalila and other roles.
</P>
<P>
   During the '20s and '30s, Antonio Scotti, the impassioned
Italian baritone, and Giovanni Martinelli, the heroic Italian
tenor, each racked up eight opening nights, as did Robert Merrill,
the robust American baritone, in later decades.
</P>
<P>
   With six each, the next closest female artists on the list, also
from that storied era, are the soprano Emma Eames and the contralto
Louise Homer, both beloved American artists.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, especially in earlier decades, the Met did make
important statements with its choice of works and singers for
opening nights. And the decisions were often influenced by social
movements and historical events.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1891, the Met's ninth season, a new team of
managers rescued the company from German control. The direction was
set in the company's second season in 1884 by Leopold Damrosch, the
German-born conductor, who believed unabashedly in the superiority
of Germanic music and urged the Met to court the growing population
of German immigrants in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's operas were repertory staples, and even the occasional
French or Italian work was performed in German. If some critics
today think that James Levine, the artistic director of the Met,
monopolizes the podium, they should consider the case of Damrosch,
who announced at the beginning of 1884 that he would conduct every
single Met performance and did so until his death in February 1885.
</P>
<P>
   The new team signaled a shift back to varied repertory on
opening night in 1891 with a performance of Gounod's ``Romeo et
Juliette,'' featuring the elegant Polish tenor Jean de Reszke and
Eames in the title roles.
</P>
<P>
   Opening night on Oct. 28, 1929, provided a powerful but
unintentional statement. A contented and no doubt well-heeled Met
audience heard Bori and Beniamino Gigli, Caruso's successor, in
Puccini's ``Manon Lescaut,'' about the ruinous effect of
materialism on young love and the good life. The next day the stock
market crashed.
</P>
<P>
   After France fell to the Nazis during World War II, the
sweet-toned, light-as-air French coloratura soprano Lily Pons
became an ardent spokeswoman for her home country. In 1942 her
patriotism burst into an opening-night performance of Donizetti's
French-language ``Fille du Regiment.'' Pons, singing the title
role, interpolated ``La Marseillaise'' into an aria as she waved a
French flag while the stirred audience joined in.
</P>
<P>
   When Sir Rudolf Bing took over the company as general manager in
1950, he made a major artistic statement on his opening night with
a performance of Verdi's longest, most difficult, arguably greatest
but then seldom-heard opera, ``Don Carlo.'' The incomparable cast
featured the bass Cesare Siepi and the mezzo-soprano Fedora
Barbieri in their Met debuts, Merrill, and Jussi Bjorling in the
title role.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961 Leontyne Price became the first black singer to star in
a Met opening night. She portrayed the title character in Puccini's
``Fanciulla del West'' opposite the Brooklyn-born tenor Richard
Tucker. This was a scant seven years after Marian Anderson broke
the color barrier at the Met.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Price was also at the center of the opera world when she
sang in the 1966 premiere of Samuel Barber's ``Antony and
Cleopatra.'' With this work the Met inaugurated its Lincoln Center
house. Most critics felt that whatever the merits of the score, the
opera was smothered by the gaudy, empty extravagance of Franco
Zeffirelli's production. But there was no mistaking the importance
of Ms. Price's selection.
</P>
<P>
   To bestow such an honor on a black American artist in the middle
of the civil rights movement was a powerful statement. The opera
was broadcast live on radio, and in an affecting press conference
shortly before the premiere Ms. Price beamed with teary pride as
she told reporters that a radio station near Laurel, Miss., her
hometown, had raised funds and boosted its wattage so that it could
hook into the Met's broadcast for the big day of Laurel's
celebrated native daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, for the Met's centennial opening night, the opera of
choice was Berlioz's ``Troyens,'' an inspired but daunting work.
This was a five-hour evening, not typical opening-night fare and no
crowd pleaser. Why was it done? ``I wanted it, I asked for it and
they agreed with me,'' Levine said recently. ``The more I thought
about it, `Les Troyens' represented exactly what we want: an epic
work, a one-evening work, a work that you can only do with large
flexible resources like the Met's.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I said to everyone that this time I think artistic
considerations should come first because of the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, ``We had the cast.'' Indeed they did, with
Tatiana Troyanos as Didon, Jessye Norman in her Met debut as
Cassandre and Domingo as the hero Enee, who was already performing
in his sixth opening night.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's opening offers another promising Met artist in
his company debut, the 36-year-old Argentine tenor Jose Cura as the
young peasant Turiddu in ``Cavalleria Rusticana.'' In 1994 Cura won
the international vocal competition sponsored by Domingo. This
season, at the company Domingo directs, the Washington Opera, he
will conduct Cura in Verdi's ``Otello.'' Domingo said he was proud
to have been a mentor to the young tenor and happy to share the
evening with him. But does he not feel at all competitive with this
hunky, highly touted Argentine, who looks great onstage and is
tackling many of the older tenor's signature roles, including
Otello?
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition does not really exist,'' Domingo said. ``It's
friendly competition. Everyone wants to do well. No one wants the
other to be bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds good. But it is hard to imagine that such an attitude got
Domingo to this record-setting opening night. He does not seem
worried, though. Even if this turns out to be his last Met opening
night, his record of 18 should be almost impossible to beat. Of
course, that's what they said about Caruso's 17. Not to mention the
Babe's 60. And McGwire's 70.

RIVALS SEEK TO CAPITALIZE ON BUSH'S ABSENCE FROM PARTY MEETING IN
CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ With $52 million backing his campaign for the
Republican Party's nomination for president in 2000, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas sat out the California GOP convention here, attending
the Ryder Cup golf tournament in Massachusetts this weekend
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's absence at the state party's twice-yearly gathering left
him open to familiar attack, this time from his rival for the
nomination, Steve Forbes, a multimillionaire publisher who placed a
distant second behind Bush in the Iowa straw poll last month.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's absence also opened the way for another
candidate, Elizabeth Dole, who has been struggling for support in
the face of Bush's overwhelming financial advantage, to deliver the
keynote address at the convention's dinner on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes spoke at lunch and at a press conference on Saturday. On
Friday night, the Forbes campaign threw a lavish party featuring an
open bar, dessert and a swing band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's George?'' Ken Blackwell, the national finance chairman
for Forbes' campaign, asked shortly before Forbes addressed the
lunch crowd. ``That's the operative question.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Bush's failure to appear, Forbes said, ``The more he
does it, the more he helps us.'' He also challenged Bush to five
debates before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   With the first primaries still months away, the Bush campaign
has had to fight a perception of complacency, given the governor's
war chest and his strong first-place showing in the Iowa straw poll
and in national surveys.
</P>

   Earlier this month, Bush canceled an appearance at an elementary
school in Central Falls, R.I., because of poor weather, but managed
to attend a fund-raiser in nearby Providence the same night. Vice
President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner for president,
altered his travel plans two days later to make an appearance at
the same school, where his spokesman told reporters, ``We'll take
kids over cash any day.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, it was Forbes who swooped in. Casting himself as
an outsider defying a party whose leadership had all but officially
thrown its support behind Bush, he said the governor's absence
``underscores the difference between the GOP establishment, which
just likes to trim around the corners and duck, and those of us who
want to engage in real issues that help real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Forbes' speeches, literature and pictures seek to portray
him as the ideological heir of Ronald Reagan, his attack violated
Reagan's often-stated 11th commandment: ``Though shalt not speak
ill of another Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the edict fell to Mrs. Dole, who refrained from
attacking Bush for not showing up. ``He runs his campaign and I'll
run mine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, state party officials said Bush did not attend
the convention here because he had gone to the Republican National
Hispanic Assembly dinner in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday Scott McClennan, a spokesman for the Bush
campaign, acknowledged that the dinner had taken place on Friday
night, and that on Saturday Bush was ``fulfilling a prior
commitment'' to ``watch his good friend Ben Crenshaw,'' coach of
the American golf team, at the Ryder Cup in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign released a statement dismissing the criticism
voiced by Forbes, whose platform calls for a flat income tax.
``Other candidates can talk about things but what's important is
that Governor Bush has acted on Republican principles and gotten
proven results, such as by signing the two largest state tax cuts
in Texas,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   McClennan noted that Bush had agreed to one primary debate on
Jan. 15. ``There will be plenty of time for debates when voters are
paying attention closer to the primaries and causes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Bush had come to California twice since he began
his campaign for the party's nomination, and would return on
Tuesday to campaign in Bakersfield, Riverside, Silicon Valley and
Santa Barbara. ``He is campaigning hard in California and across
America to earn the Republican nomination, and reach out to people
with his message of prosperity with a purpose,'' McClennan said.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though Forbes sought to make an issue of Bush's absence, in
truth few of the people attending the convention _ all of them
members of the 1,400-person state party apparatus _ appeared
disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel snubbed,'' said Carl Olson. ``I don't need to see
him in person to know what he's up to. He's in the papers every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Schockency, who was on hand for Mrs. Dole's speech, was
also not annoyed that Bush was not there. ``It doesn't bother me,''
she said. ``It's a long way to the election.''
</P>
<P>
   And Joan F. Stevens seemed almost envious that Bush was at the
Ryder Cup. Noting the longstanding friendship between Bush and
Crenshaw, a fellow Texan, she said: ``I can understand that. I hope
he's having a good time.''

HEAD OF RUSSIA'S CENTRAL BANK LASHES OUT OVER NEW LOAN CONDITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
(With RUSSIA-YELTSIN) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Only hours after hearing Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers describe the new conditions Russia must meet to
receive continued international aid, the head of the country's
central bank said his country was ``being treated like whipping
boys'' by Washington and suggested he would resist intensive audits
of his country's books.
</P>
<P>
   The comments by Viktor Gerashchenko, a wily veteran of Russia's
shifting political scene, who also ran the Soviet Union's central
bank, marked the first time that Russia has openly and harshly
criticized the extensive new auditing demanded by Washington before
lending new money to Moscow through the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials said that Gerashchenko's outburst _ in
which he suggested that the new restrictions on lending to Russia
were chiefly a product of Washington politics _ was in sharp
contrast to his behavior during the meeting with Summers. Several
suggested that he may have been playing to a domestic audience in
Russia, where the accusations of money laundering and the demands
for new audits have smacked of more American interference in the
running of Russia's chaotic economy.
</P>
<P>
   His criticism of the United States also runs counter to the
message that Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, has been
delivering here. Ivanov was asked by Russian President Boris
Yeltsin to reassure American officials, media and other groups that
Moscow is strongly interested in cracking down on corruption and
welcomed international scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say,'' one senior administration official said,
``that they don't have their talking points in full agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Ivanov's promises of cooperation, Gerashchenko,
speaking to reporters after meeting Summers, said that he was
already providing the IMF with as much information as it needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can improve the technology once,'' he said, ``but why
should we have to account for everything every day? Do we have to
publish our accounts in the gutter press or at official councils?''
</P>
<P>
   Among the American demands, which were incorporated in a
financial communique issued by the finance ministers of the Group
of Seven industrialized nations on Saturday night, Russia must
agree to quarterly audits of its central bank reserves, the public
money that is a key measure of the government's fiscal health and a
major factor in the value of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF was surprised by last year's discovery that the central
bank was linked to an offshore investment company in the Channel
Island of Jersey and that the bank had misreported its asset levels
to the fund. The offshore company, Fimaco, was acquired by a
subsidiary of the central bank during Gerashchenko's previous
tenure as central bank chief, although the Fimaco operations that
have drawn the most attention to date fell during the 1994-98
period when he did not head the central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Summers continued his public warnings to Russia on Sunday,
repeating the line he took at the opening of a congressional
inquiry last week into corruption, money-laundering and the
still-unsubstantiated charges that IMF funds had been illegally
diverted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about Russia,'' Summers said. ``The capacity
of the IMF and the World Bank to help bring about effective
policies depends on the will and capacity of Russian authorities
and the Russian people to carry forward reforms in their national
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   He specifically said it was ``critical'' that Russia develop
``adequate safeguards to ensure that funds provided by'' the bank
and the fund `are used for their intended purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   As the two men sparred from a distance, Russian officials on the
sidelines of the annual meetings here of the World Bank and the IMF
said they did not know when they would receive an additional dose
of aid that had been scheduled for release this month. It is
essentially money that will be used to pay back the IMF for
interest due on past loans _ in this case, about $370 million _ and
as an additional safeguard the money will never actually enter
Russia. Instead, the IMF will transfer it from one fund to another;
it is akin to getting a loan from a bank to pay one's mortgage from
that bank for the month.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With more and more young people choosing their
challenges in college and their rewards in civilian jobs, a serious
shortage of military recruits is forcing the Pentagon to revamp its
strategy for filling its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the Pentagon's own consultants say the armed forces
have not yet faced up to the severity of the recruiting gap and
need to do still more.
</P>
<P>
   When the fiscal year ends on Thursday, the Army will fall short
of its recruiting goal for the second year in a row, signing up
nearly 7,000 fewer enlistees than the 74,500 it needs to maintain
its force at current levels. It is the worst shortfall since 1979,
when the Army was recruiting twice as many recruits as it does now.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force, too, is expected to miss its target of 33,800 by
between 1,500 and 1,800 people, despite having paid for commercial
television advertising this past year for the first time in its
history. The Navy, which fell 12,000 recruits short last year, may
just squeak by, but only after lowering its goal from last year and
accepting thousands of recruits who never made it through high
school but earned only general equivalency diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Marine Corps, the smallest force and the one with
arguably the strongest traditional appeal to prospective recruits,
has kept pace.
</P>
<P>
   The recruiting shortfall has prompted growing concern at the
Pentagon, where officials are scrambling to turn the trend around.
They stop short, though, of calling it a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Army, like all the services, has increased its advertising
and raised its signing bonuses: recruits can get $6,000 just for
signing up before Thursday, on top of bonuses. It has also
increased the money it offers recruits for college tuition to as
much as $50,000, up from $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   And in a striking break with tradition, the Army has sent
hundreds of fresh young soldiers on recruiting assignments back to
their hometowns in the hope that they can convince others like
themselves to join.
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Dennis L. Neal, who undertook such a mission recently in a
tough neighborhood of the nation's capital, where he used to live,
has barely been in the Army long enough to know if he likes it. His
entire military experience so far has been a couple of months of
basic training and truck-driving school. Now the Army has turned to
him to do what veteran sergeants are hard pressed to accomplish
these days: find new recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I tell them,'' Neal, 21, said the other day as he stood
with colleagues from one of Washington's two recruiting stations at
a street music festival a few blocks from where he grew up, ``is
that it ain't so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Raising an all-volunteer military has never been easy, but the
difficulties with recruiting have been mounting in recent years as
the economy courses along and college becomes an attainable goal
for more young people than ever. Even as Congress and the Pentagon
pour millions of dollars more into advertising and marketing, many
officials fear the problem may only get worse.
</P>
<P>
   In a report last week, a federal advisory commission studying
national security in the 21st century included recruiting
shortfalls as one of the threats the U.S. military is expected to
face. The commission, headed by former Sens. Gary Hart and Warren
B. Rudman, cited surveys showing a sharp drop in young men,
especially young black men, who even consider joining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not clear how the military establishment, then, will
sustain the volunteer force over the next generation and,
particularly, how it will manage to recruit and retain enough
highly skilled personnel to meet the increasing technical needs of
an advanced military,'' the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   Next month the Army plans to inaugurate a pilot program to pay
6,000 high school dropouts to study for GEDs so they can qualify to
join the active force or the reserves. And in an effort to tap the
growing number of young men and women who go straight to college
after high school, another program will let prospective recruits
sign up but put off basic training for up to two years to finish
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many unexploited opportunities that we haven't
taken advantage of to improve recruiting,'' the secretary of the
Army, Louis Caldera, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   And yet even Caldera warned that the Army needed to reverse the
waning interest in military service among the first generation of
young people whose fathers came of age after the draft ended in
1973. ``If unabated,'' he said, ``it might not make a difference
what kinds of resources you're plowing into recruiting.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Pentagon attribute poor recruiting to a variety
of forces that have collided at once.
</P>
<P>
   The pool of young men and women between 18 and 22 _ the optimum
age for recruits _ has shrunk to roughly 21 million, 5 million
fewer than in 1980. Making matters more difficult for the military,
the nation's economic boom has resulted in the lowest unemployment
rate in years, creating abundant job opportunities for those who
might otherwise enlist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a very tough environment right now,'' Gen. Henry H.
Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the
Senate's Armed Services Committee this month.
</P>
<P>
   But there is evidence that the problems may lie with the
Pentagon as much as with economic and demographic trends.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen hired two
prominent Washington political consultants _ Carter D. Eskew, a
Democrat, and Michael R. Murphy, a Republican _ to review the
Pentagon's recruiting strategy and the $300 million its spends on
ads. Their preliminary findings, presented to Cohen and other
senior officials last month, were sharply critical of the services'
recruiting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The Army, Navy and Air Force have failed to articulate a clear
image and purpose to prospective recruits, they told the officials.
Only the Marine Corps has a distinct image to sell, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other services need to find themselves, post Cold War,''
Rudy De Leon, the under secretary of defense for personnel and
readiness, said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The consultants also recommended that the services conduct more
thorough research into the attitudes and habits of the young, and
rely less on traditional approaches to television advertising, like
buying time during basketball or football games that reach only a
certain segment of young people.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that the Pentagon increasingly needed to focus
its pitch on ``influencers'': parents, teachers and coaches, many
of whom appear to be discouraging young people from considering the
military because either they never served or they have lingering
hostility from the Vietnam era.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has already taken the consultants' critiques to heart.
One of the first casualties may be the jingle that the Army has
used for the better part of two decades _ ``Be All That You Can
Be'' _ even though Advertising Age magazine recently ranked it one
of the most memorable of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of value in that, because it's very
recognizable,'' Caldera said. ``But the question we have to ask is,
is it the right message for the young people you are trying to
attract?''
</P>
<P>
   Others have said more drastic measures are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Charles C. Moskos, a sociologist at Northwestern University who
served on the national security advisory panel, has been calling on
the services to offer shorter enlistments, of 15 or 18 month, a
strategy that the Pentagon says wastes money spent on training.
Moskos, though, argues that shorter stints could be tailored to
college students interested in serving on missions like those in
Bosnia or Kosovo that are straining the Army's resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call it junior year abroad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Steve Buyer, the Indiana Republican who is chairman of
the House's subcommittee on military personnel, said the problem
was the missions themselves _ a complaint echoed by the leading
Republican presidential candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, in
a speech last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fooling ourselves if we believe we can solve the problem
with more GED programs or more money for ads,'' Buyer said. ``What
we need is a change in foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the burden has fallen on the Army's recruiters,
who put in long days trolling for recruits in an ever-dwindling
pool of prospects. Each month the recruiting station here in
Washington, located on Florida Avenue in the Northeast section, is
supposed to enlist 12 or 13 new recruits. On average, the station's
10 recruiters have been getting six to eight.
</P>
<P>
   First Sgt. Beth Ann Lockett, a 12-year veteran, said the hardest
part is finding people who even qualify, let alone show interest.
She has to turn away single mothers, people who score too low on
the military's aptitude test and those who have used drugs recently
_ not uncommon traits among young people, especially in poorer
neighborhoods. Those convicted of serious crimes are also
disqualified, though she hastened to add, ``We can work with legal
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recruiters' time is spent on the phone chasing down
leads, or setting up shop in places where young people gather, as
Sgt. Lockett and her crew of soldiers, including Neal, did the
other evening at a radio station's street festival in Potomac
Gardens, a gritty housing project in Washington's Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   As hip-hop music blared, though, the recruiters had little to
do. Almost no one over the age of 10 paid much attention to the
brochures neatly stacked on two rickety folding tables. Finally,
after more than an hour, the first prospect appeared: Damall
Kellem, a 17-year-old senior in the Class of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He took a brochure, but he said most young people do not give
military service much consideration. ``It's not even in their
vocabularies,'' he said with a shrug and walked off.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A giant radioactive souffle is rising toward the
top of a million-gallon tank of nuclear waste buried in the desert
near Richland, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Whipped up unexpectedly by a pump that was supposed to dissipate
pockets of hydrogen gas, the waste has smothered one tube for vapor
sampling, threatens other instruments and could eventually
overflow, according to officials of the Department of Energy and
the contractor in charge of the tank, Lockheed Martin Hanford Corp.
They are rushing to pump some of the waste into another tank,
possibly within a month.
</P>
<P>
   In May, workers stopped the growth, at least temporarily, by
lancing the crust with high-pressure water jets, but the hole they
made is beginning to close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make any claims about this tank,'' said Donald Oakley,
a retired environmental expert from Los Alamos National Laboratory,
hired by the Energy Department as an outside consultant. ``I'm not
convinced anyone understands the chemistry and physics involved in
this crust.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Washington State Department of Ecology, Mike Wilson,
manager of the nuclear waste program, said that before the crust
was lanced, engineers were predicting the waste would reach the top
of the tank this fall. ``It was `The Blob' kind of thing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old tank, called SY-101, is buried just under the
surface at the Hanford nuclear reservation, 20 miles from Richland,
a city of about 32,000 people. The tank produces unwanted hydrogen
as radiation fields bombard organic chemicals that were added years
ago in what officials now say was a mistaken strategy to reduce the
waste's volume.
</P>
<P>
   Until six years ago, the hydrogen was emitted in huge releases
that official studies call burps, causing ``waste-bergs,'' chunks
of waste floating on the surface, to roll over.
</P>
<P>
   With the tank belching thousands of cubic feet of gas at roughly
100-day intervals, Energy Department officials were afraid that at
some point it would burp during a lightning storm and cause an
explosion. ``Under certain conditions, you could rupture the
tank,'' said Leo Duffy Jr., who was the Energy Department's chief
environmental official during the Bush administration. ``You'd have
a challenge on your hands in the state of Washington,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An explosion would spread radioactive material into the
environment, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the gassy eructations were the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the chance of fire or explosion, the Energy Department
ordered installation of a huge pump in July 1993 to break the
hydrogen into tiny bubbles, which engineers hoped would then rise
to the surface like carbon dioxide fizzing out of a soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   For a time that worked. But engineers theorize that the crust
started to toughen because it no longer rolled over from time to
time, and it prevented the hydrogen from coming to the surface. In
December 1997, the crust began to rise, even though virtually
nothing was being added to the tank.
</P>
<P>
   The waste's surface climbed from about 403 inches above the
bottom of the tank to 435 inches at its peak, before workers lanced
it, with each inch representing almost 3,000 gallons. That level
was 13 inches above the maximum specified for the tank's operation.
By Friday, the waste had risen again to 432 inches. The tank is
protected by a double shell, but the waste is within 2 feet of the
level at which the outer shell ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting awfully close, closer than we wanted to be,''
said Dr. Carolyn Huntoon, assistant secretary of energy for
environmental management.
</P>
<P>
   The crust also grew downward, and could eventually threaten the
intake nozzle of the mixer pump. Experts say that if it clogged the
pump, the hydrogen would begin accumulating at the bottom again and
burping to the surface, but the crust that would then roll over
would be four times bigger than it was before the pump was
installed. And the vapor space at the top of the tank would be far
smaller, making it easier to reach a hydrogen concentration that
would support a fire or explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rollovers were spectacular, but now we've got another
problem, caused by the solution to that problem,'' said Stephen
Agnew, a chemist who worked at Hanford for years. ``Unfortunately,
there doesn't seem to be an end to it,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another expert, Robert Alvarez, a former senior adviser to the
energy secretary on environment, safety and health, said of the
managers at Hanford: ``They were lulled into complacency and forgot
the fact the pump was only meant to be a temporary measure to
mitigate the problem. They completely ignored the fundamental
problem of dispositioning these materials.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanford managers should have transferred some of the contents to
a different tank and diluted the rest to break up the crust years
ago, he and others say.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in June 1996, the Energy Department crossed hydrogen
off its list of problems at SY-101; in October of that year it
announced that ``all safety issues with the tank are now
understood.''
</P>
<P>
   Fran DeLozier, president of Lockheed Martin Hanford Corp., said
in a telephone interview, ``It really wasn't until the fall of 1998
that everyone was convinced the crust was growing, that we didn't
know how to stop the growth and that the solution was to do a
transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, some people thought the department was moving too
slowly. In June Agnew sent an e-mail to Oakley that said, ``It is
amazing that the level has reached 435 inches and no one is freaked
out yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that they are not sure the pumping will work
and that they will not trade a bad situation (one problem tank) for
a worse one (two problem tanks). There is only one spare tank
available, and some experts think the wastes may be incompatible
with other wastes that are supposed to go into it, organic liquids
from older, leaking tanks that the department wants pumped dry, and
wastes from a defunct plutonium-processing plant nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole situation at Hanford is a reaction mode rather than
a planning mode,'' Duffy said. ``I gather they're baffled by what's
going on.''

ONCE IS ENOUGH, JAMES SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Americans won't have Mark James to boo when
the Ryder Cup moves to The Belfry at Sutton Coldfield, England, in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``One captaincy is enough,'' said the 49-year-old native of
Manchester, England. ``If I come back, it will be as a player, but
after seeing these golfers, I'm going to need an extra 20 or 30
yards off the tee.''
</P>
<P>
   The European captain, who has played on seven Ryder Cup teams,
said he is resigning. ``I'm stepping down,'' said James. ``It's a
once-in-a-lifetime job. There are plenty of other deserving
candidates to become captain and they should get their chance. It's
such a terrific honor. But, there is no chance of me
reconsidering.''
</P>
<P>
   James enjoyed the role and spent much of Sunday shuttling from
one player to another, offering encouragement and trying to rally
his forces. He wasn't a Bill Parcells coach. He was more like Pete
Carroll _ and he lost.
</P>
<P>
   Giving American captain Ben Crenshaw the credit, James said he
could see the momentum changing. But he wasn't prepared from the
Americans' blitzkrieg Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't think that Crenshaw out-maneuvered him with the
pairings or the use _ or non-use _ of players. James said it was a
``team decision'' to keep three of his players on the sidelines for
the first four matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you told me before the final round that I could use seven
players in my first four matches and have a 10-6 lead going into
the singles matches on Sunday, there is no question I would have
done just that.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Sunday's Brookline Massacre, James said it would
be disappointing to see the Europeans lose the Cup needing just
four points. ``To say I'm disappointed would be an
understatement,'' said James.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't select any heroes or goats on his squad. ``I haven't
looked at the scoreboard,'' he said. ``I don't know who played
well. But I don't think any one player is responsible. We came as a
team and we will lose as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't like what he saw when so many Americans rushed out on
to the green when Justin Leonard sank his history-making putt on
17. He doesn't blame Crenshaw either. ``It wasn't the right thing
to do. Jose still had to putt. '' Olazabel's distraction wasn't the
reason Europe lost. ``I don't hold Ben Crenshaw responsible for the
action. The Americans won. They got out to a quick start and the
rest of the team rode it to victory. We tried to stop it, but
sometimes you just can't.''

YELTSIN'S WIFE DEFENDS HIM IN RARE TV APPEARANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With G7-MEETING) 
(nk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Trying to dispel mounting allegations of corruption,
the wife of President Boris Yeltsin delivered an emotional defense
of her family in a rare television interview.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast by the state-owned television network ORT on Saturday
night, the interview was the first time that a member of the
Yeltsin family had addressed the nation on charges that the
president and his youngest daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, received
kickbacks from the Mabetex construction firm.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Naina Yeltsin nor an indulgent interviewer dealt with
the accusations in any detail. Instead, Mrs. Yeltsin portrayed her
family as people of modest means who were the victim of a
sensationalist and politically biased press and jealous rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even my granddaughter says, `Granny, what shall I say in
school, after what they wrote about us?,''' Mrs. Yeltsin recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, `Masha, people are losing their honor and their
scruples,''' she added. ```But you know we do not have any villas
abroad or castles or yachts. We do not have them. So why should you
get upset about all this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Yeltsin is the most popular member of a generally unpopular
family. With her husband's approval ratings at a low and her
daughter, Tatyana, the subject of numerous corruption rumors, she
may be the family's best hope to influence public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians think of her approvingly as a homemaker who stays
aloof from political intrigue and does quiet charity work.
Certainly ORT, a government network largely controlled by the
tycoon Boris Berezovsky, did its best to present Mrs. Yeltsin in a
sympathetic light.
</P>
<P>
   The interview, which was conducted by Pavel Sheremet, an ORT
journalist known for his crusading reports about political abuses
in Belarus, followed moving coverage of the funeral of Raisa
Gorbachev, the wife of the last Soviet leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society has often been cruel to these wise woman,'' Sheremet
said, referring to the criticism of Mrs. Gorbachev for her refusal
to stay in the background and for her sense of style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now history repeats itself,'' he added. ``We are witnessing an
unprecedented attack on the family of the first Russian president.
Does it not occur to anyone that the family suffers from this?''
</P>
<P>
   During her 10-minute interview, which appeared to have been
taped in a Yeltsin country residence, Mrs. Yeltsin was dressed in a
tasteful two-piece dark gray suit and light blue scarf. Two
steaming cups of tea sat on the table, as befits a gracious Russian
hostess.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Yeltsin was not accompanied by any family members. And she
spoke more in sorrow than in anger. She insisted that the rumors of
failing health that have dogged her husband are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read the papers I sometimes find rubbish like he cannot
lift a pen or move his tongue to speak,'' she said. ``I take it all
quite hard.''
</P>
<P>
   And she presented Tatyana Dyachenko as a dutiful daughter who
has been unjustifiably tarred because of her foray into politics.
</P>
<P>
   As Yeltsin's image adviser, Mrs. Dyachenko has become an
increasingly influential member of the Kremlin inner circle. She
has been accused of receiving a credit card from the Mabetex
construction firm, and the Russian press has reported that she has
a lavish foreign villa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts when all these fables are told about her,'' Mrs.
Yeltsin said. ``When I read that she was a drug addict, I thought
well, one can really get carried away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes wonder what prayer I should say to relieve her of
all this,'' Mrs. Yeltsin added. ``When I try to comfort her, she
says, `Mom, I hope you can endure all this.' I am a mother. I can
endure even more because I have already lived my life, and she has
it all ahead of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the former supporters who have now turned against
them, she said that was not the result of mistakes on her husband's
part, but the self-interested machinations of ambitious
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, power spoils many people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports that Yeltsin is so concerned that his
enemies might seek to punish his family if he leaves office,
perhaps by launching corruption investigations, that he might look
for ways to prolong his control.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Yeltsin was never asked about this speculation. But she
used the interview to reassure the nation that her husband plans to
turn over the reins of power, as scheduled, in July. All the family
wants, she insisted, was to live quietly after that and perhaps do
a little tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all live under God,'' she said. ``If we are in good health
and have the opportunity we might go someplace to see something.''

METS' NIGHTMARE CONTINUES WITH 3-2 LOSS TO PHILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ They have tried players' meetings and a manager's
meeting, blasting music and a clubhouse so quiet it could have
existed in a vacuum. On Saturday the manager suggested he should be
fired if the team does not make the playoffs, and on Sunday he
pulled the ultimate desperate managerial move: He changed his
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is working for the Mets right now _ not the subtle
details nor the dramatic strokes, not all the positive talk, not
Bobby Valentine's insistence that he felt great after leaving the
park Saturday. Not even plunging Edgardo Alfonzo from the second
spot in the lineup to the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets lost again Sunday, 3-2, to the Phillies, completing an
apocalyptic, wearying six-loss road trip in which they were swept
by the two extremes of baseball: a very hot team and a team that
had been reeling toward oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, the Mets' luck, which Valentine has been convinced
for the last few days was about to change, got even worse when the
game was over. The Reds won on a three-run homer in the bottom of
the 12th inning to take a one-game lead in the wild-card race. In
the space of six days, the Mets have gone from being one game out
of the division lead to scrambling to stay in the wild-card race
with six games left.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the Braves, who come to town on Tuesday for a
three-game series that now looms about as ominously as Mount
Everest, clinched the division Sunday. After the Mets had another
drab performance, after a day of assurances by general manager
Steve Phillips that this predicament might actually make things
easier for the Mets, they slink home to an off day, unable to
explain just what has happened to their season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at a loss for words,'' Mike Piazza said. ``I don't want to
say it, but it can't get much worse. I think everyone is stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets left Veterans Stadium on Saturday, they did so to
the beat of salsa music and with their stomachs full of crabs from
their postgame meal. It was an oddly convivial scene, and Phillips
said the players might have been relieved that they no longer had
to look over their shoulders at the Reds gaining on them, that
having them side by side would be a good thing. Now, the Reds are
passing at full speed, while the Mets have pulled off into the
breakdown lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rickey has got nothing to say about this crazy stuff now,''
said Rickey Henderson, and that was before he knew about the Reds'
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have tried everything to break out of their funk.
Sunday, Valentine pulled another trick out of the same pocket that
no doubt holds the sword he nearly threw himself upon a day
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine had gone out for dinner Saturday night, he said, and
began thinking that the Mets needed to present a different
challenge to opposing teams, by breaking up their string of
left-handed hitters in the five, six and seven spots of the lineup.
Valentine said he was on the exercise bike Sunday morning when
Alfonzo, the right-handed hitter who had been batting second for
most of the season, wandered in and suggested the same thing: Put
the left-hander Roger Cedeno, who bats seventh, in the two spot and
insert Alfonzo at sixth, between the lefties Robin Ventura and
Darryl Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how it works,'' Valentine said. ``I've never done
shake-it-up changes. I think we've had really good lineups and now
this is a better lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   But this one did not get it done any better. Rick Reed pitched
well enough to keep the Mets in the game, giving up three runs, two
of them on a two-run homer by Rico Brogna with two outs in the
fourth. But the Phillies had the former Met Paul Byrd starting the
game, the same pitcher on whom the Mets pasted seven runs in four
and a third innings one week ago. Byrd's fastball had been clocked
in the low-80s in recent weeks, indicating that his arm was all but
dead, and the Phillies had lost his last five starts, in which his
earned run average was 9.39.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The Mets managed just five hits and two runs in seven
innings against Byrd, and the two runs were a terrible
disappointment when so much more finally seemed possible.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning, Piazza led off with a single, but was
taken out at second when Ventura hit into a fielder's choice. After
Alfonzo flied out, Hamilton walked, moving Ventura to second base.
Rey Ordonez belted a 1-1 fastball to right field that scored both
Hamilton and Ventura. Matt Franco, pinch-hitting for Reed, walked
on four straight pitches but Byrd, obviously facing his last
batter, got Henderson to strike out with an 87 mph fastball.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the ninth inning _ along with that improbable eighth
inning in Wednesday's game against the Braves _ that may go down as
one of the signs that the Mets are not going to pull out of this
tailspin. Alfonzo grounded out to lead off the inning, but then
reliever Wayne Gomes delivered 11 straight balls en route to
walking Hamilton, Ordonez and pinch-hitter Bobby Bonilla. With
Shane Halter running for Bonilla and Steve Montgomery in to pitch,
the game came down to Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured we could at least push one across,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't. On a 1-2 count, Henderson made contact and the
ball took one bounce on the AstroTurf headed toward right field.
The ball bounced so low that the second base umpire, Rich Rieker,
had to dive to get out of its way. But Dave Doster, who had been a
defensive replacement _ the same guy who snagged Benny Agbayani's
liner to end the Mets' best threat Saturday _ grabbed the ball on
the short hop. He flipped to shortstop Desi Relaford to start the
game-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to change,'' Valentine said for what seemed like
at least the fourth day in a row. ``It always happens and we're too
good for it not to happen. When it comes, it will come in bunches.
It was real close to changing today and I think the guys felt it.''
</P>
<P>
   If they aren't already numb.

WWJLD: LAMPLEY ENLIGHTENS US ON SPORTS FANS' MORAL ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So who needs a moral compass? Hey, at some time or another, we
all do. In particular, the sports fan who often encounter
situations in which common sense just doesn't apply.
</P>
<P>
   For that, we usually find ourselves asking: What would Jim
Lampley do?
</P>
<P>
   To some, he's the Troy McClure of American sportscasters. To the
rest of us, he's Jack Nicholson's golf buddy who possesses the
utmost standards, journalistically and metaphorically. Lampley has
volunteered to offer his guidance to resolve some of the potential
dilemmas you might face in your daily sports life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most sports fan wouldn't know a moral dilemma if it hit them
across the head with a two-by-four,'' Lampley said when asked about
participating in this feature.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, we seek his advice:
</P>
<P>
   __ Situation: You've been standing in the stadium refreshment
line for a good 20 minutes to grab four beers for you and your
friends. Coming back down the aisle, a kid running up the steps
bumps into you, and you lose three of the beers. You're left with
one. What do you do? Risk missing more action and get back in line?
Guzzle the beer for yourself and go back to your seat claiming you
couldn't wait in the line any longer? Bring the one beer back for
your friends to share while you go back to get refilled?
</P>
<P>
   __ What Jim Lampley would do: ``Obviously, the key element to
this is what's going on in the game and how much time is left. It's
the entertainment you're missing. In this case, your friends are
meaningless. They should be buying for themselves. The beer left in
your hand is the one God intended for you. That's why it survived
the collision. It's your right to drink the beer that the universe
wanted to be yours.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Situation: A line-drive foul ball is blistered into the
stands right at you, and even to your surprise, you reach up and
snare it. The fans give you a nice ovation and you're on
Diamondvision. Before you have a chance to show the ball to those
sitting around you, a 10-year-old comes over from a few rows away
and asks: ``Hey, mister, can I have the ball?''
</P>
<P>
   __ What Jim Lampley would do: ``You give the ball to the kid
because it was not a Mark McGwire or Sammy Sosa home run ball. If
you're looking for a simple dividing line _ you keep fair balls
because they're the ones worth keeping. Foul balls are extraneous
to the universe by their definition.''
</P>

COMMENTARY: THE GORE COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Words in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Today's essay is being written six weeks early. In
the political punditry dodge, you have to stay ahead of the
contrarian pack.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Bill Bradley is on a roll. The towering former
basketball star is jumping higher than Al Gore in New Hampshire
polls. The studious Senate retiree is less-dull-than-expected in
television interviews. The once-lonely challenger from left field
is on the cover of Time-Warner: ``The Man Who Could Beat Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's central appeal to Democrats is that he is Not
Associated With Clinton. That's why, in a recent speech, he stole a
slogan from Thomas E. Dewey: ``It's time for a change.'' Through
Sen. Pat Moynihan, Bradley last week hung a sign around the neck of
Gore that trumps the political loyalty card, the sort that sank the
national aspirations of famous figures from Henry Clay to Robert
Taft:  &UR; Gore Can't Win &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   New York, which will hold its primary early next year, is
crucial to a Democrat, and in the Empire State Bradley is
overtaking Gore. Why? Because Democratic politicians lumbered with
Hillary Clinton's candidacy for the Senate are desperate to get
right with voters on the left and in the center profoundly
afflicted with ``Clinton fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Their solution: dump the second half of Clinton-Gore. Sorry, Al,
they sigh; we have all the Clinton we can handle with Hillary _
without you at the top of the ticket symbolizing no end to the
tiresome era. In the face of this need for a new face; in light of
a media and audience need for a lively primary battle; and
considering the tendency of many Democrats to root for an underdog
gaining momentum against the establishment choice _ what chance
does a poor, loyal, vice president have?
</P>
<P>
   Better, I submit, than it now appears. It will get worse for
Gore before it gets better, as early polls support the ``can't
win'' theme and much is made of high-profile defections to his
challenger, but come November it is likely to get better. Here's
why:
</P>
<P>
   1.  &UR; He will cut himself loose from the albatross around his
neck. &LR;  At the almost-joint appearance before the DNC last weekend,
Gore made his first speech in seven years devoid of reverent
mention of the name Clinton. It was like an epiphany. Look for
growing degrees of separation.
</P>
<P>
   2.  &UR; Reporters will get bored with the Bradley Surge and look for
the next development: the Gore Comeback. &LR;  In political coverage,
it's always time for a change. At that two-contestant DNC beauty
parade, after Bradley dutifully read a prepared speech, Gore spoke
with some passion without notes. He paced the stage with all
appropriate zeal, which placed him as far as he could get from the
vice presidential seal on the lectern.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, pandering expertly to organized teachers who dominate the
Democratic convention, subtly zinged Bradley on his long-ago
willingness to experiment with education vouchers. Only in horse
racing do front-runners stay clean; as the track muddies, Bradley
can expect principled excoriation for his inexpert pandering on
Iowa ethanol,
</P>
<P>
   3.  &UR; Bush's ratings will come down out of the stratosphere as
people realize he is the son, and as Republicans consider John
McCain, the best-selling alternative. &LR;  The difference in the
advantage of Bush over Bradley vs. Bush over Gore will inexorably
narrow, blunting the Bradley campaign's ``Gore can't win'' attack.
</P>
<P>
   4.  &UR; Any McCain rise in New Hampshire will help Gore. &LR; 
Independents there can vote in either primary; now they're going
for Bradley, but as McCain gets traction he'll attract more of them
over to the Republican primary. George Bush's choice of politics
over principle in begging Buchanan to stay was bad politics, and
gave McCain another character-defining issue attractive to
independents.
</P>
<P>
   5.  &UR; Gore will take the fight to the challenger by calling for a
series of debates. &LR;  Gore favors NATO expansion and Bradley seems to
oppose it; though that issue is a yawner to most, it has resonance
in states with voters whose ethnic roots are in Eastern Europe.
Gore is a tough debater, as Ross Perot and Jack Kemp learned to
their rue, and Democrats will then ask themselves: Who would do
better against Bush or McCain?
</P>
<P>
   After the coming Gore Comeback, watch this space for early
analysis of the Bradley Resurgence.

WITH BRITISH COURT BEGINNING HEARINGS, PINOCHET WILL LEARN HIS FATE
SOON 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who has called himself ``the
only political prisoner in England'' since his arrest here nearly a
year ago, will begin finding out this week whether he must go to
Spain to face charges of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Weeklong hearings starting Monday at Bow Street Magistrates
Court are the first action in the case since May. Then, the last of
many legal maneuvers ended with the failure of his High Court
appeal of Britain's decision to let the Spanish extradition request
go forward. Pinochet, the 83-year-old former Chilean dictator, will
not have to be present in these new hearings until the day the
ruling is issued.
</P>
<P>
   The case has transformed international law and galvanized human
rights and exile groups. It also has stirred passionate old
antagonisms in Chile and other countries that have emerged from
dictatorial regimes to face demands for justice from relatives and
representatives of the victims of abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its eventual outcome, the Pinochet case has already
secured a valuable legal precedent for the rights movement: the
finding that former heads of state do not enjoy immunity from
prosecution for systematic atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bridgehead has been established: the concept of crimes
against humanity as the arrow that pierces the Achilles' heel of
state sovereignty,'' said Geoffrey Robertson, a well-known London
lawyer and an authority on war crime prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Pinochet case has caused diplomatic problems for Britain
even though the government has been at pains to say that the
general's detention has, from the start, been a police and judicial
matter, not a political one.
</P>
<P>
   The strain in relations between Spain and Chile intensified this
month when Chile recalled its ambassador to Madrid for the second
time in protest over the treatment of Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
has had to give formal backing to the extradition request by the
high-profile maverick investigating magistrate, Baltasar Garzon,
but has made it clear it does not support the undertaking and has
no desire to see the former Chilean president in the dock in
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   In a rebuff to Spanish prosecutors seeking to short-circuit the
case before it ever gets to Madrid, a three-judge panel from
Spain's National Court ruled Friday that Garzon does have
jurisdiction to prosecute Pinochet on human rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   He has been living with his wife, Lucia, under house arrest in a
rented mansion in an exclusive suburb in Surrey, south of London.
Military, business and Senate leaders from Santiago have been
flying in periodically to back his case for being freed. In the
most recent instance, a group of them gathered on Sept. 11 to
celebrate the 26th anniversary of the coup that brought Pinochet to
power.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet himself has remained out of the public eye, appearing
only on several occasions during the summer when he was taken in a
wheelchair to a nearby hospital for checkups. His supporters say he
suffers from dizzy spells, diabetes and heart, kidney and prostate
problems, and they contend that he ought to be released immediately
on humanitarian grounds because of his deteriorating health.
</P>
<P>
   The state of his health will play no role in the coming
hearings, which are expected to last five days and produce a
verdict in three weeks. The presiding judge, Ronald Bartle, the
deputy chief metropolitan magistrate, will be ruling only on
whether the extradition application is in order and whether the
crimes it lists are extraditable offenses. The European Convention
on Extradition does not require Spain to produce evidence of its
charges.
</P>
<P>
   If the decision goes against Pinochet, he will be able to appeal
it, and that would prolong the year-old case many more months. If
he did not appeal, the final decision would rest with Jack Straw,
the home secretary, who is Britain's top law-enforcement official.
</P>
<P>
   For Straw, Pinochet's age and health would be a significant
determining factor. Straw could decide that the general is not fit
enough to comply with the extradition order and free him on
compassionate grounds to return home.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The general's backers have publicized his hospital visits during
the summer and emphasized the fact that continued detention is
damaging his health. He has told friends that he is depressed and
is becoming resigned to dying in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph in July, he complained
that he had been ``kidnapped,'' and he denied any direct
responsibility for any atrocities in Chile. ``I didn't have time to
control what others were doing,'' he said. ``At this very precise
moment, let's say, the only political prisoner in England is me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the one court appearance he has had to make, he said at a
bail hearing in December that he does not recognize the right of
any court outside of Chile to try him ``against all the lies of
Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16, 1998 at the request
of Garzon, who had assembled a case against him in the course of
studying atrocities committed during the so-called dirty wars in
Latin America in the 1970s. Garzon took the bold step of asking the
British police to arrest the general after learning that he was in
a London hospital recovering from minor back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The case wound its way through Britain's courts, and in March
the country's highest tribunal, the Law Lords of the House of
Lords, upheld his arrest but drastically reduced the scope of the
case. It threw out all but charges of torture and conspiracy to
torture and said he could not be extradited for any offenses before
Dec. 8, 1988, when the United Nations torture convention took
effect in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The original 285-page Spanish indictment had accused him of
genocide, murder, torture and kidnapping in connection with the
deaths and disappearances of more than 3,000 people dating back to
1973, the year he seized power and began his 17-year-long rule of
Chile. Since the March ruling, Garzon has added other charges to
the indictment, bringing the new total to 108, all dating from
after 1988.

FOR ONCE, US PUTTING COULDN'T MISS

   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ On Saturday, they couldn't sink a putt if
their lives depended on it.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday they couldn't miss one.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't matter whether it was long or shot. The hole was bigger
than the ocean and that, more than anything else, brought the Ryder
Cup back to the homeland.
</P>
<P>
   None was bigger or more dramatic than Justin Leonard's 30-footer
on the 17th against Jose Maria Olazabel that assured victory for
the US. That followed Leonard's 25-footer on 15 to square the
match.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were these biggies:
</P>
<P>
   --Tom Lehman's 18-footer on 13 to go four up on Lee Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   --Hal Sutton's 15-footer on the 1st to get the jump on Darren
Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   --Davis Love's 15-footer on 11 against Jean Van de Velde to go
four up.
</P>
<P>
   --Steve Pate's 12-footer on the 8th to go one-up on Miguel Angel
Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
   --Jim Furyk's 20-footer on 12 to go four-up on wunderkind Sergio
Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   And those were just the putts of notable distance. Just as
important were the ones of 3, 4, and 5 feet to halve a hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one meant something, everyone was big,'' said US captain
Ben Crenshaw. ``I've been saying all along that holing out is the
name of the game in match play. That's what determines holes. I
finally got my message across.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe's Colin Montgomery, who made some great putts throughout
the weekend, had his say on the American's sudden ability to find
the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greens were the same. It was just one of those things, you
know. Everyone that plays golf understands that sometimes they go
in and sometimes they don't. One of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson had his share of putting woes Friday and
Saturday, but drained a few beauties Sunday in his 4 and 3
thrashing of Jarmo Sandelin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played aggressively and were confident on the green,'' he
said. ``We played with belief in ourselves that we could putt
better than what we had shown. We were determined to make something
happen today and we did. I can't explain why the putts went in, we
just knew that they were going to.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, who apologized to the Europeans for the celebratory
scene his putt on 17 caused, and who was four down to Olazabel
before making his charge, said once the putts started to fall, he
felt much better about the US situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed right from the start, when Hal's (Sutton) putt fell
on the first, that we were going to be okay,'' he said. ``That
seemed to set the tone for the rest of us. Golf's a funny game.
What falls one day, doesn't fall the next. We missed most of ours
Friday and Saturday. Today they were just dropping. Everything we
missed over the weekend put us in a hole. Today they fell and we
dug ourselves out.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A giant radioactive souffle is rising toward the
top of a million-gallon tank of nuclear waste buried in the desert
near Richland, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Whipped up unexpectedly by a pump that was supposed to dissipate
pockets of hydrogen gas, the waste has smothered one tube for vapor
sampling, threatens other instruments and could eventually
overflow, according to officials of the Department of Energy and
the contractor in charge of the tank, Lockheed Martin Hanford Corp.
They are rushing to pump some of the waste into another tank,
possibly within a month.
</P>
<P>
   In May, workers stopped the growth, at least temporarily, by
lancing the crust with high-pressure water jets, but the hole they
made is beginning to close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make any claims about this tank,'' said Donald Oakley,
a retired environmental expert from Los Alamos National Laboratory,
hired by the Energy Department as an outside consultant. ``I'm not
convinced anyone understands the chemistry and physics involved in
this crust.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Washington State Department of Ecology, Mike Wilson,
manager of the nuclear waste program, said that before the crust
was lanced, engineers were predicting the waste would reach the top
of the tank this fall. ``It was `The Blob' kind of thing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old tank, called SY-101, is buried just under the
surface at the Hanford nuclear reservation, 20 miles from Richland,
a city of about 32,000 people. The tank produces unwanted hydrogen
as radiation fields bombard organic chemicals that were added years
ago in what officials now say was a mistaken strategy to reduce the
waste's volume.
</P>
<P>
   Until six years ago, the hydrogen was emitted in huge releases
that official studies call burps, causing ``waste-bergs,'' chunks
of waste floating on the surface, to roll over.
</P>
<P>
   With the tank belching thousands of cubic feet of gas at roughly
100-day intervals, Energy Department officials were afraid that at
some point it would burp during a lightning storm and cause an
explosion. ``Under certain conditions, you could rupture the
tank,'' said Leo Duffy Jr., who was the Energy Department's chief
environmental official during the Bush administration. ``You'd have
a challenge on your hands in the state of Washington,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An explosion would spread radioactive material into the
environment, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the gassy eructations were the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the chance of fire or explosion, the Energy Department
ordered installation of a huge pump in July 1993 to break the
hydrogen into tiny bubbles, which engineers hoped would then rise
to the surface like carbon dioxide fizzing out of a soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   For a time that worked. But engineers theorize that the crust
started to toughen because it no longer rolled over from time to
time, and it prevented the hydrogen from coming to the surface. In
December 1997, the crust began to rise, even though virtually
nothing was being added to the tank.
</P>
<P>
   The waste's surface climbed from about 403 inches above the
bottom of the tank to 435 inches at its peak, before workers lanced
it, with each inch representing almost 3,000 gallons. That level
was 13 inches above the maximum specified for the tank's operation.
By Friday, the waste had risen again to 432 inches. The tank is
protected by a double shell, but the waste is within 2 feet of the
level at which the outer shell ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting awfully close, closer than we wanted to be,''
said Dr. Carolyn Huntoon, assistant secretary of energy for
environmental management.
</P>
<P>
   The crust also grew downward, and could eventually threaten the
intake nozzle of the mixer pump. Experts say that if it clogged the
pump, the hydrogen would begin accumulating at the bottom again and
burping to the surface, but the crust that would then roll over
would be four times bigger than it was before the pump was
installed. And the vapor space at the top of the tank would be far
smaller, making it easier to reach a hydrogen concentration that
would support a fire or explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rollovers were spectacular, but now we've got another
problem, caused by the solution to that problem,'' said Stephen
Agnew, a chemist who worked at Hanford for years. ``Unfortunately,
there doesn't seem to be an end to it,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another expert, Robert Alvarez, a former senior adviser to the
energy secretary on environment, safety and health, said of the
managers at Hanford: ``They were lulled into complacency and forgot
the fact the pump was only meant to be a temporary measure to
mitigate the problem. They completely ignored the fundamental
problem of dispositioning these materials.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanford managers should have transferred some of the contents to
a different tank and diluted the rest to break up the crust years
ago, he and others say.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in June 1996, the Energy Department crossed hydrogen
off its list of problems at SY-101; in October of that year it
announced that ``all safety issues with the tank are now
understood.''
</P>
<P>
   Fran DeLozier, president of Lockheed Martin Hanford Corp., said
in a telephone interview, ``It really wasn't until the fall of 1998
that everyone was convinced the crust was growing, that we didn't
know how to stop the growth and that the solution was to do a
transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, some people thought the department was moving too
slowly. In June Agnew sent an e-mail to Oakley that said, ``It is
amazing that the level has reached 435 inches and no one is freaked
out yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that they are not sure the pumping will work
and that they will not trade a bad situation (one problem tank) for
a worse one (two problem tanks). There is only one spare tank
available, and some experts think the wastes may be incompatible
with other wastes that are supposed to go into it, organic liquids
from older, leaking tanks that the department wants pumped dry, and
wastes from a defunct plutonium-processing plant nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole situation at Hanford is a reaction mode rather than
a planning mode,'' Duffy said. ``I gather they're baffled by what's
going on.''

EUROPEANS DECRY LACK OF US SPORTSMANSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When Justin Leonard's outrageously long putt dropped in
the hole, Tony O'Sullivan was prepared to applaud the American,
especially given that Leonard's stroke had won not only the Ryder
Cup but had secured O'Sullivan a tidy sum in a bet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as Americans raced onto the green even before Spain's
Jose Maria Olazabel got a chance to launch a last desperation putt
to put off the inevitable, O'Sullivan watched it on television and
reacted as all of Europe reacted: with disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typical Yanks,'' O'Sullivan said, shaking his head, standing
at the bar in the Duke's Head, a pub in Highgate, North London.
``You can win this like a gentleman, or you can win it like that.
I'd be embarrassed to win it like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Duke's Head, and across Europe, the Americans won respect
for their golf game, but not for their decorum. The Americans may
have won, but they won badly, according to Europeans. Across Europe
Sunday night the newscasts told that Europe lost the cup but won on
style points. Newspapers Monday will repeat that theme.
</P>
<P>
   It was a crushing defeat for the Europeans, who had outplayed
the Americans in team play over the first two days and needed only
4 points from the 12 singles matches Sunday to retain the Ryder Cup
they won two years ago in Spain. But the Americans put together the
greatest comeback in the 33 Ryder Cup matches ever played, closing
it out with a putt that, like Leonard, was Texan in length and
brazenness.
</P>
<P>
   They were so confident at the Duke's Head Sunday that they put
the ``footie'' on the telly. Football, or soccer, is normally king
in pubs in London, in all of England, and in all of Europe on
weekends in September, but it takes a backseat when the Ryder Cup
is on.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, however, had a commanding 10-6 lead in the Ryder Cup, so
the Duke's Head regulars treated themselves to the
Wimbledon-Tottenham soccer match. By the time the Ryder Cup
coverage was switched on, Mark Kingston had a bad feeling. The TV
graphic showed the Americans ahead in the first six matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're effed,'' Kingston said, taking up a pint of Guinness for
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Kingston sat at the end of the bar in the Duke's Head, a narrow
pub, 40 feet long and 10 feet wide. The Duke's Head is one of those
places in London where there is a mix of English, Scots and Irish,
with the occasional continental thrown in. They constantly insult
each other, good naturedly.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, Englishmen like Kingston were cheering on Scots like
Colin Montgomerie and Irishmen like Padraig Harrington. In fact,
the Englishmen at the Duke's Head were cheering on Harrington, a
Protestant from Dublin, and Darren Clarke, a Catholic from Northern
Ireland. When Harrington won his match on the final hole, he was
toasted lustily at the King's Head.
</P>
<P>
   But even as American golfers put on a dominating display of
skill, Europeans were preoccupied by the lack of etiquette shown by
the gallery at The Country Club. The heckling of Montgomerie, in
particular, bothered the regulars at the Duke's Head.
</P>
<P>
   Kingston, 36, a writer, was appalled, but tried to be
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that emotions are high, on both sides,'' he said.
``But the Americans are taking this to the extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony James, a bartender, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really just ignorance,'' he said. ``The people in the
crowd there don't know how to behave on a golf course. That type of
behavior would never occur in Europe, and if it did, it wouldn't be
tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   On TV, the British announcers said that marshals at The Country
Club were egging the crowd on. At the Duke's Head, people exchanged
open-mouthed stares.
</P>
<P>
   With the Americans up, 13-10, John Murphy, the Duke's Head
owner, returned to his pub after a long day out. He had watched his
native Cork lose to Meath in the All-Ireland football final. He was
stunned to learn that the Americans had overtaken the Europeans in
Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yanks come back great, don't they?'' Murphy enthused. His
customers shot him dirty looks.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was unapologetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a good sportsman,'' he said. ``I don't care who wins as
long as it's well played.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the point, Murphy's regulars and a good portion
of Europe argued. The Americans showed superior skill, but an
appalling lack of grace in victory.
</P>
<P>
   Kingston was reflective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like sour grapes, but I really think there is a
cultural difference here,'' he said. ``When Americans want
something, they go and get it. They don't care what other people
think. They don't care how it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan, meanwhile, was regretting his windfall, which came
at 5-2 odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have rather lost my bet,'' he said. ``I won my bet,
but the Ryder Cup is gone. The whole idea of the Ryder Cup, great
golf and good sportsmanship, ended today. It's all over.''

NEW MEDICARE HANDBOOKS ARE DESIGNED TO END CONFUSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Inserts Medicare's toll-free number in 2nd graf.)  (lb) 
 By ROBIN TONER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a vast public education campaign, the biggest in
the 34-year history of Medicare, the federal government is mailing
handbooks to 39 million Medicare beneficiaries this month to try to
guide them through the increasingly complicated world of health
care.
</P>
<P>
   Backed up by a new toll-free telephone service (1-800-633-4227),
an expanding Internet site (www.medicare.gov) and outreach efforts
with more than 200 local and national groups, the new campaign is
intended to aid an aging population that, experts say, is often ill
equipped to handle the brave new world of health-care choices
envisioned by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy-Ann DeParle, the administrator of the Health Care
Financing Administration, which oversees Medicare, has said that
this may be the ``biggest peacetime education program the federal
government has ever undertaken.''
</P>
<P>
   But the challenge facing this new campaign, which was delayed
last year for more research, is daunting. Many health planners and
lawmakers on Capitol Hill dream of a nation of savvy elderly
consumers taking advantage of a competitive marketplace that offers
them a choice of health plans. But so far, many experts say, there
is significant confusion among the elderly about the costs and
benefits of these choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a managed-care basher,'' said Shoshanna Sofaer, a
professor of health-care policy at Baruch College of the City
University of New York, who is advising the federal government on
its education efforts. ``But I'm saying we really do have to
recognize that it's going to be difficult and take a while for
people to get this stuff. And for a significant percentage, they're
never going to get it, because they're cognitively impaired,
they're too frail, or they just don't have the energy to invest in
understanding these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it the complexity factor, or what happens when political
theory (choice is good) collides with reality (choice is
confusing).
</P>
<P>
   Carol Cronin, director of beneficiary services for Medicare,
estimates that 70 percent of the Medicare recipients now can choose
between traditional Medicare and at least one HMO. About 16 percent
are in an HMO.
</P>
<P>
   And while the market has been in some turmoil in the past few
years, with the managed-care industry complaining that the
government pays it too little for Medicare beneficiaries, and with
many HMOs leaving the program, more and more of the nation's
elderly are expected to end up in HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Help lines, like the Medicare Rights Center in New York, say
they are flooded with calls from older Americans, or their
frustrated sons and daughters, trying to determine which
health-care plan is best for them. ``It's all incredibly
complicated not only for seniors but for everyone, including me,''
said Diane Archer at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven Medicare beneficiaries, five in HMOs and six in
traditional Medicare, assembled at the John Booth Senior Center in
Baltimore last week and offered a glimpse of life on the front
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Dominiak, 79, a retired credit investigator, said she had
looked at the new Medicare guide and understood some of it, but
confessed: ``I don't understand managed care at all. It's like
reading Greek.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine McGurrin, a 79-year-old retired real estate agent who
is happily enrolled in an HMO, said she thought the guide would
help in making decisions, but added that she also relied on
relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk to other women: `Where do you go?''' Ms. McGurrin
said. ``You get five or six people you talk to, maybe three of four
of them say one thing, it more or less points you in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Linz, a 72-year-old retired electrician from General
Motors, said he got a lot of information about health care from
retiree meetings at his old workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agreed that health care had become more complicated.
Most had war stories about being trapped in voice-mail systems
trying to get answers. ``Blue Cross Blue Shield, if you live long
enough to get through to a human being, they'll answer questions,''
Mrs. Dominiak said. ``You got to push this, and push that.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Mirabile, a 79-year-old retired sewing-machine operator,
said she still did not understand some of her bills. She added with
a rueful laugh, ``I just pay them.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Medicare guide, ``Medicare &AMP; You 2000,'' is part of an
information campaign mandated by Congress in the 1997 legislation
that was intended to open the Medicare market to even more kinds of
health plans than now exist. The estimated cost of the education
effort in this fiscal year is $133 million.
</P>
<P>
   The guides are the result of months of market testing, focus
groups, expert reviews and survey research, much of which
discovered that Medicare beneficiaries have only a sketchy
understanding of the basic Medicare program, let alone the new
managed-care choices.
</P>
<P>
   Focus-group studies done for the Kaiser Family Foundation, a
health research group, show that even many of the elderly who are
already in HMOs ``don't understand the rules that govern their
care,'' said Tricia Neuman, a Kaiser analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Focus groups also show that their adult sons and daughters are
``very angry over how confusing the program is,'' Michael Perry, a
pollster, said. Those who counsel older Americans say they
sometimes do not understand the tradeoffs they make _ for example,
getting prescription-drug coverage by joining an HMO but giving up
a full choice of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making it more complicated for people, and we're also
making it more consequential,'' Ms. Sofaer said. One of the
messages in the new Medicare campaign is that people do not have to
choose. ``If you are happy with the way you get your health care
now, you don't have to do anything,'' says a recorded voice on the
Medicare toll-free line. Live counselors are available during work
hours Monday through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The new Medicare guide, which is produced in 26 regional
versions and is being mailed to 32 million households, features
basic information on what the traditional program covers, as well
as the options for Medigap insurance to supplement it, and the
basics on managed-care plans.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes information on the managed-care plans available
in a beneficiary's region, as well as data on the quality of the
plans _ for example, consumer ratings of how well the doctors
communicate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It includes a three-page summary at the front, beginning with
``Welcome to Medicare &AMP; You!'' which is an attempt to lead the
beneficiary through the basics in simple language. But insurance is
inherently difficult, and before long, the handbook is in the
thicket of benefit periods and Part A and Part B.
</P>
<P>
   It describes the choice between traditional Medicare and
managed-care plans (HMOs), which is politically fraught on Capitol
Hill, this way: ``In most plans, you can only go to doctors,
specialists, or hospitals on the plan's list. Plans must cover all
Medicare Part A and Part B health care. Some plans cover extras,
like prescription drugs. Your costs may be lower than in the
Original Medicare plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the handbook, more information is available on the
Internet, although Ms. Cronin acknowledged that it was more likely
to be used by relatives, friends and state insurance counselors
than by older people themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of managed care contend that the market will work only
when consumers have a wealth of information upon which to base
their decision. But Bob Blendon, an expert on public attitudes and
health at Harvard, said studies showed that older Americans are
much less likely than younger people to make consumer decisions on
the basis of statistical data.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Dr. Lee Newcomber, senior vice president for health
policy at United Healthcare, which has a large Medicare business,
said, ``You really have to do a face-to-face conversation with a
senior to really help them through it.'' Once enrolled at his
company, elderly beneficiaries are assigned to a personal service
representative ``so they call the same person whenever they have a
question,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, experts say, this confusion will be eased by
time, as more and more of the people entering Medicare have
experienced managed care in their working lifetimes. Already, said
Ms. Cronin, newer retirees have less of an information gap, ``so,
in effect, we have two generations within this current Medicare
population.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, calls to the toll-free lines, which are staffed
in Iowa and Wisconsin, are climbing. ``It's up to about 17,000 to
20,000 a week, and the handbook is just starting to arrive,'' Ms.
Cronin said last week.

CHEERS KEPT US TEAM PUMPED UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The roars kept coming in waves, from
different sections of The Country Club course.
</P>
<P>
   And repeatedly European players who prepared to hit shots that
were becoming increasingly difficult had to step back as more
cheers erupted, signaling another step in the great American
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the cheers came as a sense of relief, as with Mark
O'Meara's 4-foot putt for a halve on 17 in his match with Padraig
Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   Other times they came from sheer joy, as when David Duval closed
out his match with Jesper Parnevik, 5 and 4, with a birdie on 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans staged the greatest comeback in Ryder Cup history
with their skill, but like athletes from team sports who need a
jump-start from the crowd, something rarely seen in golf, the US
players fed off the raucous fans.
</P>
<P>
   The European players later complained about the crowd's
behavior, particularly the heckling of Colin Montgomerie. ``Cheer
for your team all you want,'' said Jose Maria Olazabal, ``just show
respect for your opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the home-court _ or home-course _ advantage was
everywhere. One didn't need to look at the Jumbotron screens or the
scoreboards to learn how the matches were progressing. The crowd
said it all.
</P>
<P>
   A roar at four meant a Tom Lehman birdie, which put him 1 up and
on his way to a 3-and-2 victory over Lee Westwood; an explosion at
10 meant Phil Mickelson had gone 3 up in his match with Jarmo
Sandelin. And on and on it went.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly it built, and the players fed off the cheers, as
evidenced by Lehman doing his best Hale Irwin imitation circling
the 13th green and pumping his fist in triumph after a birdie put
him 4 up with five holes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew every time I approached the green and pulled my hat off
it would turn the volume up,'' said Steve Pate, who beat Miguel
Angel Jimenez, 2 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   The outbursts hit their apex when Justin Leonard made his
45-foot birdie putt on 17 against Olazabal, which put the Americans
on the brink of victory. When Olazabal missed his 20-foot birdie
try, the comeback was complete.
</P>
<P>
   And then the celebrations really began, creating some remarkable
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, the favorite foil of American golf fans who played
so well all weekend, suffered the ultimate indignity of having to
walk up the 18th fairway through a gallery chanting ``USA, USA'' as
he finished his meaningless match with Payne Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The American team streamed onto the 17th green to congratulate
Leonard after his miracle putt, angering Olazabal, who had to
regroup before his birdie try that would have kept the Europeans'
hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the staid courtyard in front of The Country Club
clubhouse had turned into a love fest. People streamed across the
once well-manicured grounds, waving American flags, chanting ``USA,
USA.'' The American team turned the side balcony into a frat house,
spraying each other and the crowd with champagne.
</P>
<P>
   The record books will give the US team the victory, but Sunday's
crowd merits at least a footnote.

 &HT;    Braves still beast of the East
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ They hadn't even cleared the field, most of the
Braves still trundling up a tunnel to the clubhouse when the news
flashed in from Philadelphia. The Mets had lost again. A troubling
but resilient division race had reached a conclusion. Really?
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves won their eighth consecutive division title
Sunday. Just when the year was supposed to get interesting, the
team gave the NL East the back of its hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``In six days, we gained six games,'' said manager Bobby Cox.
``That's impossible, you think. But it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a minute of the conclusion of the Braves' 10-0 win over
Montreal, the Mets' 3-2 loss in Philadelphia clinched it. Eddie
Perez produced his second four-RBI game of the year and John
Smoltz, winless for the past 4 1/2 weeks, threw his most dominant
game of the season (eight scoreless innings on six hits). It didn't
seem possible but that's how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't think we could do it here,'' first baseman
Ryan Klesko said. ``They gotta lose three and we gotta win three to
clinch here. I thought we'd have to win one or two in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Not now. This week's three-game series with the Mets becomes a
non-issue, save for the New York cry for Mets manager Bobby
Valentine's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like we couldn't shake the Mets all year,'' said second
baseman Bret Boone. ``Then we have that series with them (last
week's three-game sweep) and we come up as big as we can. I mean,
you couldn't write a better script.''
</P>
<P>
   The Expos were gone before they knew it, the Braves twice
loading the bases in the first inning for a Brian Jordan two-run
single and Perez's base-clearing double that provided a 5-0 lead
seven at-bats into the day. Perez became the latest metaphor for
this year's club, a second-line player asked to produce in the
place of an injured star (Javy Lopez).
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't paying too much attention to what was going on with
the division,'' Perez said. ``So before the game, Bobby (Cox) told
me I needed to get a big hit today so we can clinch. I mean, what
are you talking about?''
</P>
<P>
   With their seventh consecutive win, the Braves hold the year's
biggest divisional lead at seven games over New York. Long before
the 10 cases of champagne were exhausted, the club had to pause to
reconsider the loss of four front-line players and just what it had
gone through the previous seven months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means so much because of what we went through in the course
of the year,'' third baseman Chipper Jones said. ``I don't know of
any other team that could take the hits we took and be able to be
standing here in this position.''

CARNIVAL ON CLYDE STREET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ She will tell her grandchildren about the
rumble in a jungle called The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   So will a jubilant swarm of golfing bugs who surged across the
rumpled, sun-strewn acreage like locusts Sunday, partaking of the
moveable shotmaking feast.
</P>
<P>
   She is among them _ the more than 30,000 wanna-see's.
Resourceful Ruth Lyne, slim and chic with flowers in her straw hat,
towers tip-toe above the roped-in multitude on her portable
grandstand. She is clapping for a United States triumph that seemed
very remote 24 hours before. Her grandstand is a gray plastic milk
carton that she lugs from hole to hole, making her a face above the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gramma . . . what happened then?'' the tykes will someday
clamor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justin Leonard . . . '' she will go on, ``Justin Leonard made
the damndest putt _ a 45-footer _ on the 17th, and for the
Americans it was, `Come back home, guys . . . all is forgiven.''
Comeback was the day's word, all right. A counter-punching comeback
as it had been in the original ``Rumble in the Jungle'' in Zaire a
quarter-century ago. Then Muhammad Ali, belting George Foreman as
though he had 1-irons in his gloves, regained his world.
</P>
<P>
   And Ruth Lyne, a local lady, was glad to be a Ryder Cup witness.
Doubly glad for her milk crate that may have been a designer model.
Instead of Ralph Lauren, however, it was labeled ``Guida's Dairy,
New Britain, Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our houseguest, Wally Schwind from Fairfield, Conn., brought
it as a present,'' Lyne says. Much more thoughtful than candy or
flowers. Definitely more useful as the golf-watcher's friend. It is
the dearest of gifts now _ even historic _ because of what it
enabled her to behold. She hasn't decided whether to hang it from
the living room ceiling as the Spirit of St. Louis is displayed at
the Smithsonian, or send it to the golfing Hall of Fame at St.
Augustine, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture experts say she should keep it in the family at least
until 2049 because milk crates are certified as valued antiques at
age 50.
</P>
<P>
   Where did the donor, Schwind, get the treasured pedestal?
</P>
<P>
   All he will say is that it fell off a truck.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to the Europeans. They fell off the truck
in blowing their 10-6 lead, something like Thomas Dewey squandered
his lead in the 1948 Presidential race to Harry Truman.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Lyne's crate was but one of many elevational props on a day
when never had so many spent so much time seeing so little.
</P>
<P>
   It seems dumb luck to happen onto a hole where something
wonderful is happening _ and you have a clear look at it. The
cheering, at a minimum Friday and Saturday, resounds across the
course like express trains, signifying the US recovery _ always
over there somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   As Sunday commenced it looked as if there could be a revival of
a book by sometimes-Bostonian Henry James called ``The Europeans.''
But, for the tourists, the day turned into the dead end of the
suspense novel by Brooklynite Stanley Ellen: ``House of Cards.''
</P>
<P>
   The first chapter of the horror story was written in the blood
of France's Jean Van de Velde. A bygone Frenchman, a pal of George
Washington, the Marquis of Lafayette, came to this country to help
Americans. Van de Velde did so, too, reluctantly, losing to Davis
Love, 6 and 5. The cards, bad ones, began falling for the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   It became to-halve or halve-not, and the holiest grail called
the Ryder Cup was won and lost by a half-point. By 4:19 of a
glorious last-taste-of-summer afternoon, the struggle is over.
</P>
<P>
   The Carnival on Clyde Street (become Carnage on Clyde for the
Cup defenders) has wound down, although celebration will continue
into the moonlit night. Prince Andrew, come to cheer Europe, was
whisked off in a Rolls-with- police-escort in the direction of his
dysfunctional family. His misfunctional team has vanished,
presumably wandering the dark and deserted greens to study putting.
</P>
<P>
   But an Englishwoman named June Gregory with small blue,
gold-starred flags of the European Community in her hair, sits on
the grass near the 18th hole, not anxious to leave. She is from
Sheffield. Smiling, she says, ``It was such a marvelous,
entertaining time.'' Amen to that.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It was incredible, emotional and historic,
the biggest comeback ever in golf's most compelling team
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup is once again American property, as the U.S. team
stormed back to win, 14{-13{, winning eight and splitting one of
Sunday's 12 singles matches _ in which scoring is determined by
winning holes instead of counting total strokes. No team had ever
overcome a four-point deficit on the final day; in fact, no team
had overcome a final-day deficit greater than two points.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 10-6 heading into Sunday's 12 singles matches, the U.S.
Ryder Cup team rose together as one, lifting one another, lifting
their games, lifting the pride of the thousands of Americans who
watched at The Country Club here and the many more who watched the
drama unfold on television.
</P>
<P>
   The cup-winning putt was made by Justin Leonard, who sank an
improbable 45-foot uphill birdie putt that became part of golf
history the instant it fell into the cup. Leonard held his putter
aloft and did a joyful dance as he ran off the 17th green, and he
was immediately mobbed to the left of the green by teammates, who
realized that their improbable dream had nearly become reality.
</P>
<P>
   When the green finally cleared, and when the ground finally
stopped shaking, Jose Maria Olazabal had a chance to keep Europe's
hopes alive. But Olazabal's 25-foot birdie attempt slid just past
the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard had clinched the half-point that clinched victory for
the U.S. team, and the Europeans, who seemed in command starting
Sunday's play, lost the Ryder Cup for the first time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For Leonard, the 1997 British Open champion, it was a day of
redemption, after he played inconsistently early in the
competition. Leonard was 4 down to Olazabal through 11 holes, but
he won the next four consecutive holes, making a 30-foot birdie
putt on No. 15, then making his unforgettable putt two holes later.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his putt on No. 17, Leonard said, ``I didn't know if
I could make it. I just believe it was one of those putts that was
destined to go in.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Europeans complimented the U.S for its victory, they
were also upset about the celebration on No. 17, because the cup
still had not been clinched, and Olazabal was still waiting to
putt. Olazabal was forced to wait several minutes before the
commotion subsided prior to attempting his putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of behavior is not what anyone expects to see,''
said Olazabal. ``It was an ugly picture. I understand there was a
lot of emotion, but you have to have both feet on the ground and
realize what the situation is. But the fact is, they played better
today, and they won.'
</P>
<P>
   U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw apologized for the outburst at No. 17,
as did his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened on No. 17 was unfortunate, but I'm not going to
apologize for being excited,'' said Tom Lehman, one of the
teammates who rushed to grab Leonard. ``It was a great day for the
American team.''
</P>
<P>
   When the competition ended, there was an outpouring of emotion
and champagne at The Country Club, in a festive scene that was the
climax of a fairy-tale day. American players cried tears of joy.
European players cried tears of sadness. Members of the American
team ran to the balcony of the clubhouse, spraying champagne on
each other, as adoring flag-waving fans watched from below chanting
``USA, USA.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Americans overcome a huge deficit, but they
overcame the tremendous play of an underrated European team, and
the heavy burden of being favored in a much-anticipated biennial
event. For two days, the Europeans played superb golf, making
spectacular shots that deflated the U.S. team, and it appeared the
Americans were on the verge of suffering another humbling loss.
</P>
<P>
   But at an inspiring team meeting Saturday night, Crenshaw and
every player talked about how much winning the Ryder Cup meant, how
they had not played up to their potential, and how they still
believed they would win.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw made a prophetic statement Saturday night, when he
proclaimed, ``I believe in fate. I have a good feeling about
this.'' Crenshaw helped deliver the motivation, and his team
delivered an impassioned performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only comments last night were that if we go down, let's go
down with all our oars in the water,'' said Hal Sutton, the best
player for America in the competition with 3{ points. ``Leaving
that meeting, we all felt we could go out and make a real run at
this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans seized control at the start Sunday and built
momentum. The American game plan was simple: to win the first four
matches, to even the competition, and to put immediate pressure on
their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans started even better than expected, sweeping
the first six matches in shocking fashion. Lehman defeated Lee
Westwood, 3 and 2. Sutton toppled Darren Clarke, 4 and 2. Phil
Mickelson beat Jarmo Sandelin, 4 and 3. Davis Love III dominated
Jean Van de Velde, 6 and 5. Tiger Woods defeated Andrew Coltart, 3
and 2. And David Duval dropped Jesper Parnevik, 5 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the U.S. team had a 10-8 lead, with the Europeans
still needing four points to clinch the tie they needed to retain
the Ryder Cup.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Fleeing days of intensive air bombardment in Russia's
war against Islamic militants, thousands of desperate refugees,
their possessions piled atop cars and trucks, clogged the roads out
of the breakaway republic of Chechnya on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 Chechens, and perhaps several times that, have
crossed the border into the neighboring Russian republic of
Ingushetia in the last few days, officials said. The Ingush
authorities appealed to Moscow for emergency assistance, including
food and tents, and closed the border Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the brink of a humanitarian disaster,'' said Akhmed
Malsagov, the acting prime minister of Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The situation remained chaotic. The line of cars and pedestrians
trying to make their way into the North Caucasus republic along one
major highway stretched for almost 10 miles. Those stranded on the
Chechen side of the border had set up tents and were gathering
firewood.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The refugee crisis is the latest indication of the rising toll
of Russia's war against the Islamic militants who have used
Chechnya as a staging ground in their fight for an independent
homeland in the region.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Russia's defense minister, Igor Sergeyev, suggested
that the fighting might intensify and hinted that the Russian
military might even thrust ground troops into Chechnya to attack
rebel sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several variants for a land operation, which will be
carried out, depending on the developing situation,'' Sergeyev
said. ``The main aim of all the plans is to destroy the bandits and
to create a sufficiently broad zone of safety around Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The talk of a ground attack _ even a somewhat limited raid
across the border against rebel bases _ risks shattering the
political consensus in Moscow, which is wary of repeating the
disastrous 1994-96 intervention that tried to prevent Chechnya from
breaking away.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov, the favorite in
the political maneuvering to succeed President Boris Yeltsin,
voiced his opposition to a major ground attack, warning that it
``may grow into a war.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin, the current prime minister, sought last week to
alleviate the public's anxiety that the nation may be drawn into a
replay of the Chechen war, a conflict that killed tens of thousands
and resulted in a humiliating defeat for the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are planning no large-scale military operation in
Chechnya,'' Putin said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A full-scale invasion of Chechnya still seems unlikely, if only
because it appears to be beyond the capability of the deteriorating
Russian military. Even Putin, however, was careful not to exclude a
commando raid, and the remarks by the defense minister suggest that
the armed forces are agitating for a freer hand.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Russia conducted its first air strike against the
Chechen capital of Grozny since the end of the Chechen war in 1996,
destroying Chechnya's lone operational aircraft and igniting an oil
refinery.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Air Force has been pounding oil refineries,
telephone installations, a television station and other industrial
targets _ many near civilian areas _ ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in the North Caucasus began in August when several
thousand Islamic fighters crossed into Dagestan and proclaimed
their intention to establish an Islamic state.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They were led by Shamil Basayev, a Chechen warlord, and Khattab,
a Chechen militant born in the Middle East who goes by a single
name.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is under the control of Aslan Maskhadov, the embattled
Chechen president, who has been relegated to a virtual bystander in
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of fighting within Dagestan and a series of
terrorist bombings that Moscow charges is the work of the
militants, the Russian military has persuaded the Kremlin to take
the fight deep into Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian air force chief of staff, Gen. Anatoly Kornukov, has
said that the air strikes could go on for a month.
</P>
<P>
   Likening the Russian strategy to the prolonged NATO bombardment
of Yugoslavia, Kornukov has said that the Air Force is using Su-25
attack aircraft and Su-24 bombers with precision weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of the Russian bombardment, and the likelihood
that it is not being carried out with anything like the accuracy
the Russian Air Force has advertised, however, has raised the
specter of large civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Chechens living in Moscow say their relatives in Grozny had
phoned them with reports of heavy bombing in civilian
neighborhoods. Some areas, which had escaped destruction during the
Chechen war, have now found themselves in the crosshairs.
</P>
<P>
   Bread has become scarce because there is no gas or electricity
for bakeries, according to reports from the region.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of kidnapping has deterred most members of the
foreign press as well as many international relief agencies from
venturing into the republic . This has deprived Chechnya of much of
the vivid, on-the-scene war reporting that turned the tide of world
opinion _ and eventually the U.S. government _ against the earlier
Russian military intervention there.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has urged Moscow to show restraint
and open a dialogue with Chechen leaders. And the Maskhadov
government has said it would welcome talks. But the Kremlin does
not appear to be in the mood to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chechens actually oppose Basayev, the Chechen warlord, and
the extreme form of Islam he champions. One risk of the bombing is
that it may turn more Chechens against Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   As reports of Sergeyev's comments spread, some Russian military
officials sought to ease concerns that the fighting would spin out
of control, resulting in a large number of Russian casualities.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's decision to move thousands of troops near the
Chechen border has previously been explained as an effort to seal
the border and create a cordon sanitaire. And some officers said it
still might not go beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to discuss specific timing,'' Yuri Baluyevsky,
the deputy chief of staff of the Russian military, said in a
television interview Sunday night. ``It's possible that they might
not go in at all. Everything will depend on how the situation
develops.''

JORDAN JOINS MATADORS STAFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Barbara Jordan had her heart broken two weeks ago
when she found out she didn't make the U.S. national softball team
that will play in the Olympics next summer in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan, from Agoura, realized a different goal last week
when she was hired as an assistant softball coach at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream was to make the Olympic team,'' Jordan said, ``and my
other dream was to coach softball at CSUN. It's always been
something I hoped to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years after they were classmates at Granada Hills High
and teammates on the Highlanders basketball team, Jordan has been
reunited with Matadors head coach Janet Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, 33, went on to become an all-conference outfielder at
CSUN, and Sherman went to UCLA and was the Bruins' starting
catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go way back,'' Sherman said of her friendship with Jordan.
``Her knowledge of the game is unbelievable. I know I have a lot to
learn from her.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan coached at Westlake last year, guiding the Warriors in
the Southern Section playoffs despite missing a portion of the
season for national-team tryouts. A national-team alternate for the
'96 Summer Games in Atlanta, Jordan was one of 38 finalists for the
final 15 spots this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had visualized playing in the Olympics,'' Jordan said. ``I
had a good tryout; I was pretty confident. I'm proud of myself for
giving it everything I had. It's just a bitter pill to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is the Matadors' outfield coach and recruiting
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   __ Swift kick: Even though she didn't think she could play
outside hitter in college, Hedder Illustre is doing everything she
can to prove the women's volleyball coaching staff right in playing
her there.
</P>
<P>
   Illustre, a 5-7 freshman from Carson, is leading the team in
digs and is third in kills. She had 30 digs at Northern Arizona on
Sept. 16, tying her for third on the school's all-time, single-game
chart for four-game matches. ``I didn't think I'd be strong enough
to play outside,'' said Illustre, who had a career-high 23 kills
against Idaho State on Sept. 18. ``In club (volleyball), I never
played front row.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though she's not as tall as her opponents, who rarely stand
under 6-feet, Illustre has imagination. She tried to preserve a
rally last week against Portland State by kicking the ball. She
didn't just stab at the ball, though; she took a full kick.
</P>
<P>
   The move is legal but rarely done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm aggressive,'' Illustre said. ``I really hate losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Illustre is proving a worthy successor at outside hitter to
Kristen Sigal, a three-year starter who left the program after
leading the Matadors in digs last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought so highly of (Sigal),'' Illustre said. ``She
was good. (But my teammates) are really supportive of me.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Big catch: The women's basketball team landed a top-notch
transfer in former Palmdale High standout Kristi Rose, a 6-4 center
and two-year starter at Utah who was selected to the All-Western
Athletic Conference's defensive team last year.
</P>
<P>
   As a Division I player transferring to another Division I
school, Rose must sit out this year. She will be eligible to play
for the Matadors as a senior for the 2000-01 season.
</P>
<P>
   Rose was fifth in the WAC in blocks in '98, averaging 1.3 per
game. She was second on the team in scoring (7.5 points per game)
and rebounding (4.8).
</P>
<P>
   Rose is the second former Daily News All-Star basketball player
to transfer to CSUN this year. John Burrell, who averaged 30 points
per game as a senior for Highland in 1995-96, came to CSUN from
Nevada in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   __ Comings and goings: The baseball team gained two commitments
last week: Jon Voita, a catcher-infielder at El Camino Real, and
Bill Wright, an all-league third baseman at Bakersfield's Garces
High.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors, who are in the third year of a rebuilding process
after the program was cut in the summer of '97, have new faces on
head coach Mike Batesole's staff. Steve Gossett, a former college
teammate of Batesole's at Oral Roberts, is the new pitching coach,
replacing Jamie Nelson, who resigned in July to pursue a
minor-league coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Another new coach is Kevin Patrick, who was the Matadors'
starting second baseman the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   __ Watch out: The cross country course at Fresno's Woodward Park
is known as one of the most challenging in the state. But some
members of the women's cross country team probably never thought of
it as dangerous _ until Sept. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors were running the course, preparing for the Fresno
State Invitational, when a mountain biker rode right into their
pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He struck Francis Santin head-on and four or five others were
diving into ditches,'' head coach Don Strametz said. ``The girls
were black and blue all over. He stopped and asked, `Are you OK?'
and then that's the last they saw of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors finished fourth the next day. Jennifer Smith was
fourth in the individual standings with a time of 18 minutes, 32
second over the 5,000 kilometer course.

AFTER SEX CHANGE, TEACHER IS BARRED FROM SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Attn: Calif.) (sw) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTELOPE, Calif. _ By all accounts, David Warfield was an
excellent teacher.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Center High School here in suburban Sacramento for
his first teaching job nine years ago and soon made a name for
himself, developing a program for unmotivated students that became
the award-winning Media Communications Academy. Students routinely
called him one of the best teachers they ever had or expected to
have, the one most likely to be remembered as a major influence in
their lives. He was awarded an $80,000 grant for his program, won
the school's ``Stand and Deliver'' award for the teacher who most
inspires students and received a standing ovation from the
district's staff at its annual meeting last September.
</P>
<P>
   Given this backdrop, when David Warfield wrote a letter to
colleagues in May explaining that he was undergoing a sex change
and planned to return to school as Dana Rivers, shock quickly
turned to sympathy. In June, after the school board sent a letter
disclosing Warfield's decision to all 1,500 families in the
district, only four parents wrote back in protest.
</P>
<P>
   But Dana Rivers has yet to walk through the doors of Center
High. Weeks before classes started, the school board voted 3-to-2
to place her on paid administrative leave pending a formal
dismissal, which is expected soon. What might have been a quiet if
difficult adjustment at Center High to get to know the person some
students once called ``mountain man'' for his love of macho sports
has instead become the sole subject of school board meetings and a
growing, rancorous debate in this ethnically diverse, middle-class
town.
</P>
<P>
   At its core lies the question: Why would Dana Rivers be fired?
To her supporters, the answer is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board members didn't want a transsexual teacher,'' said
Ray Bender, a board member who voted against dismissal proceedings.
``They said they didn't want to create confusion for the
students.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dana Rivers case, he said, has become a cause for religious
conservatives assisted by the Pacific Justice Institute, a local
conservative legal organization that demanded that the school board
fire the teacher or face a lawsuit. ``One board member,'' Bender
said, ``was heard telling a parent that this is a holy issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But board members who voted to begin dismissal proceedings say
their position has nothing to do with transsexualism, the Pacific
Justice Institute or religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the furthest thing from the truth,'' said Scott
Rodowick, the board president. ``This is about parental rights.
This is about issues that the board became aware of that have
nothing to do with the teacher's being transgendered. There are
things I know that I would love to talk about, but I have to
respect the rights of an employee. It's a personnel issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority on the board refused to discuss the case, but the
board members who voted for Ms. Rivers said that the others wanted
an excuse to fire her. They found it, the board members say, in a
few parents who complained that the teacher had improperly
discussed her condition, known as gender dysphoria, with their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``One parent stood up at a board meeting and said that her
daughter was traumatized,'' said Bender. ``But right after that,
her daughter stood up and told the board that her mother was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But Donna Earnest, whose son is a junior at Center High School,
said she was not the only one who believed her parental rights were
taken from her. ``My position is that this teacher acted totally
unprofessionally,'' she said. ``My child was not in the class, but
kids talk all over the school, and according to the kids, he said
he had been sodomized as a youth and that he always felt he was a
woman trapped in a man's body and that he was going to be changing
into a woman in the fall. He should have gotten permission from the
parents to say this.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Dacus, the founder of the Pacific Justice Institute, said
he filed administrative complaints on behalf of more than a few
parents who felt that their children had been traumatized. ``One
student had to be pulled from the school,'' he said, ``and two
children have had to be put in counseling.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rivers, on the advice of the teachers union, would not
discuss the details of the case. But her colleagues say that
students learned of her plan when teachers read Ms. Rivers' letter
to their classes. Ms. Rivers said that as rumors began circulating
throughout the school and students began asking about them, she
agreed to an interview with the school newspaper. The 2,600-word
profile was printed the week before school ended in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to send a letter to everyone telling them what I
was doing,'' Ms. Rivers said. ``I could have just walked into
school. But what confusion would that have led to?''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the debate is reminiscent of arguments about gay and
lesbian teachers who come out of the closet. But unlike gays or
lesbians, Ms. Rivers said, there was no way she could hide as she
underwent a gender transformation. Her hair is long and auburn now,
with bangs. She wears eye shadow, pink nail polish and skirts. She
has trained her vocal cords to deliver a soft, feminine tenor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a way that I could have gone on the way I was,
believe me, I would have, because this is the hardest thing I have
ever done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Until age 44, David Warfield had been a Navy electronics expert,
a political consultant and school board member in Huntington Beach
in Orange County, a baseball coach and a white-water rafting
instructor. Ms. Rivers says she is still proud of that resume, but
is happier personally now. Like many people with gender dysphoria,
which the International Center for Gender Education describes as
extreme discomfort with one's sex, Ms. Rivers said her condition
led her to alcoholism, thoughts of suicide and three failed
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been able to lead a successful life, but personally it's
been a real struggle,'' she said. ``Since I started taking hormones
last January, I've been happier because I'm getting to be who I am
for the first time. I'm going to be a better teacher for it. It's
not about being a transsexual, it's about not always pretending and
hiding.''
</P>
<P>
   She stepped near the school for the first time this school year
on Friday. Classes were not in session, but during an annual staff
day 40 students and 200 teachers held a lunchtime rally for Ms.
Rivers across the street from the school. Students chanted ``Two,
four, six, eight, we demand a reinstate.''
</P>
<P>
   Angela Duvane, 17, a senior in the Media Communications Academy,
said students missed their teacher. ``In her former state as
Warfield, she was awesome,'' Miss Duvane said. ``We all love her.
Even students who never had her as a teacher.''

IN AN ABOUT-FACE, OFFICIAL HINTS THAT JAPAN WILL MOVE TO BOLSTER
YEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The head of the Bank of Japan strongly hinted
Sunday that he was prepared to reverse course and act to halt a
three-month-long rise in the value of the Japanese yen, before it
chokes off Japan's fragile economic recovery and triggers further
clashes with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In early trading in Australia and Asia, the vaguely worded
announcement from Masaru Hayami, governor of the Bank of Japan, and
a communique issued Saturday night by the finance ministers of the
Group of Seven largest industrialized nations proved enough to
strengthen the dollar and weaken the yen.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 p.m. Sunday evening, the dollar was trading at 105.57-62
yen, up 104.09 at Friday's close in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although he denied he was changing course, Hayami's statement
appeared to mark a full retreat from the position the bank took
less than a week ago, when it defied Japanese politicians and
Washington by refusing to stop the 17 percent rise in the yen's
value.
</P>
<P>
   The behind-the-scenes struggle over Japan's monetary policy
dominated the opening this weekend of the annual meetings of the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which are also
focusing on corruption in Russia. Sunday, a new arrangement was
also struck to revalue 14 million ounces of the IMF's gold reserves
to pay off some of the debts of the world's poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   Hayami's comments Sunday are also important because Wall Street
reacted badly to last week's moves by the Bank of Japan. Investors
feared that more expensive Japanese goods could help trigger
inflation in the United States, as consumers pay more for Toyotas
and Sony electronics, among other goods. That, in turn, could
convince the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, slowing the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the future of the American stock markets seemed
increasingly dependent on the decisions of Japan's central bank, an
institution that operates by its own rules and market rationale.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision announced late Sunday, the fund said that the 14
million ounces from its gold reserves would not be sold on the open
market as originally planned _ a move that drew strong objections
from lawmakers in gold-producing parts of the United States and
from countries like South Africa. Instead, through bookkeeping
sleight-of-hand, the World War II-era gold is being revalued at
current prices, and used by the poor countries to repay their
loans.
</P>
<P>
   The G-7 ministers, in a statement Sunday night, put the onus on
Japan to solve the problems being triggered by the surprising
strength of the yen. Only if Japan acted to loosen further what the
bank already considers a dangerously loose monetary policy _
interest rates are already at zero in Japan _ would the other
countries consider stepping in and intervening in the currency
markets to weaken the yen, the statement suggested.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday, as traders went to work in Australia and Tokyo, they
were watching every utterance of Hayami, a man whose delphic
comments can make his American counterpart, Alan Greenspan, seem
like a beacon of clarity.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago Hayami, still reveling in the new independence of the
Bank of Japan, said he would not adjust the country's monetary
policy simply to control foreign exchange rates. That, he said, is
how Japan got into trouble in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since those statements by Hayami, the yen had continued to
strengthen, making Japanese exports like cars and electronics more
expensive, and thus less competitive, on world markets. At a press
conference here Sunday afternoon, Hayami, speaking in Japanese,
said that he had been ``misunderstood'' by the markets and by major
governments around the world. ``Our policy of appropriate and
timely response to developments in the economy and financial
markets was not understood by the Group of Seven,'' he said. ``Now
they understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials at the meetings say that it is Hayami who now
understands _ that the yen's rise could choke off the country's
recovery and thus hurt both Tokyo and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been the only real engine of economic
growth in the world in recent years, and the price it has paid is a
huge trade deficit, as it sucks in the rest of what the world
manufactures. Unless Japan recovers, the thinking goes, that
deficit will not be reduced by much.
</P>
<P>
   A weaker dollar and a stronger yen would, in ordinary times, be
good news for American exporters. But in this case, there are
doubts that Japanese consumers will stop saving and start buying
again unless they fear the onset of modest inflation _ exactly what
pumping more money into the economy could create.
</P>
<P>
   So the finance ministers meeting here on Saturday hammered out
language to try to create doubt in the minds of currency traders
over whether the yen would be allowed to appreciate further. ``We
share Japan's concern about the potential impact of the yen's
appreciation for the Japanese economy and the world economy,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Hayami, who last week said that controlling foreign exchange
rates was ``not an aim of Bank of Japan monetary policy'' began to
suggest Sunday night that he was revising his view. He said the
central bank was ``very concerned about the effects of the strong
yen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, as Hayami seemed by turns to want to explain the bank's
new thinking and to insist nothing was changing, he issued a
statement saying that ``the bank is prepared to use the flexibility
it has in the context of the present monetary policy stance to
respond appropriately and timely to developments in the economy as
well as financial markets, including the foreign exchange market.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was ``clarifying our position,'' adding that ``many
of us are rather old, like myself, so I simply used softer words.''

   A fast-growing company that posted record profits just two

almost half in a day. Rumors of intrigue abound. Shareholders want
to know what happened.

   Sounds like a job for Kroll-O'Gara, the United States' leading
corporate gumshoe. Only in this case, the company in question is
Kroll-O'Gara. And the reason appears to be fighting in the
executive suite.
</P>
<P>
   With stealth befitting his reputation as America's No. 1 private
detective, Jules Kroll, Kroll-O'Gara's chairman and chief
executive, has lined up several potential ``white knight''
investors who he expects will help him remove Thomas O'Gara, the
vice chairman, from the company, according to people close to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll said late last week that it had hired Bear, Stearns to
explore strategic options, including a possible sale. People close
to the company said that Kroll had found suitors who have offered
to buy the stake held by O'Gara, who has been frozen out of
management decisions since he and Kroll fought over control last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty has been bad for Kroll's once high-flying stock.
The price, which has been slipping all year from a January high of
$41.375, collapsed on Friday, falling $11.50, or 45 percent, to
close at $14.3125. The plunge followed an announcement that the
company would fall far short of third-quarter earnings estimates,
at least in part because it will delay new acquisitions while
weighing overtures from outside investors.
</P>
<P>
   The delay has temporarily derailed what had been a growth
strategy based on a steady stream of acquisitions as Kroll-O'Gara
bought a dozen security and investigative companies in recent
months. But some analysts also complained that the company had not
been forthcoming about its earnings shortfall or about the
continuing animosity between its two top executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an element of surprise here. People thought that this
was a company with a good acquisition strategy and strong growth,''
said Thomas O'Halloran, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read. ``Then
we find out that they will miss earnings by 40 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Halloran slashed his recommendation on the stock to ``hold''
from ``strong buy'' on Friday, which helped prompt the selloff. He
said he suspected that the company was having trouble integrating
some security businesses it had bought in recent months. And he
said the fact that the top bosses were not talking to each other
complicated matters.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials declined to comment on the development while
negotiations are under way for a possible sale. But several people
close to the company said they felt that Kroll's core business was
healthy and that final resolution of the conflict between Kroll and
O'Gara was not far off.
</P>

<P>
   The combination of Kroll and O'Gara seemed promising in the
early days _ less than two years ago. O'Gara Co., an Ohio-based
armored-car maker, bought Kroll Associates, a New York-based
private investigation company, in December 1997 for $101.3 million
in stock. Kroll and O'Gara struck up a close relationship, people
close to the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Though O'Gara, which was a public company, bought Kroll, which
had been closely held, O'Gara ceded the posts of chairman and chief
executive to Kroll. O'Gara's brother, Wilfred O'Gara, became the
president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   The combination got off to a fast start. An avid schmoozer who
cultivates relationships with corporate tycoons in the United
States, Europe and Asia, Kroll had long dreamed of making his
private-investigation practice into a global, one-stop center for
all kinds of corporate security. Kidnappings, terrorism and
assassinations abroad were good for business _ as was the wave of
mergers in Europe and the United States prompting companies to seek
information about a potential partner or rival.
</P>
<P>
   As a public company, Kroll-O'Gara now had stock as an
acquisition currency. The company branched out into employee drug
screening, the manufacture of surveillance cameras and accounting
services. It picked up affiliates in Hong Kong and Argentina.
Earnings grew fast and the stock soared through much of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, however, Thomas O'Gara and Kroll had a
falling out. People close to the company said they had disagreed on
the price and the timing of the company's biggest purchase to date,
of Securify Inc., a start-up specializing in Internet security that
is based in Mountain View, Calif. O'Gara pushed to get the deal
done immediately. Kroll wanted to delay the acquisition until
completion of another purchase that was less expensive and would
add to earnings sooner, people close to Kroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll did buy Securify in early February for stock valued by the
company at $55.2 million. But the conflict between Kroll and O'Gara
only worsened. O'Gara and Kroll units had not integrated very well.
Half the company was run out of O'Gara's old headquarters in
Fairfield, Ohio, the other half from Kroll's offices in New York.
Kroll, who colleagues say is sometimes short-tempered and
suspicious, froze O'Gara out of decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, O'Gara pressed the company's board of directors
to dismiss Kroll. But the board voted to support Kroll instead.
Though the company subsequently sent signals that analysts
interpreted as meaning that the tension had eased, Kroll had
decided to rid the company of the O'Garas, people close to the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Kroll hired Bear, Stearns to help him find an investor
that would buy out the O'Gara stake and allow him to run the firm
himself, these people said. The decision to hire Bear, Stearns was
not disclosed publicly until last week, at the same time the
company said it would miss earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a buyer took longer than Kroll had hoped, these people
said. One person briefed on the effort said Kroll had tried to
persuade Securitas, the Swedish security company that owns
Pinkerton, a rival of Kroll, to make a bid. It was unclear if it
had done so.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential investors include large accounting firms that
are looking to bolster their investigative units. People close to
Kroll also held out the possibility that a large private investor
might step in, replacing the O'Garas and leaving Kroll to run the
firm with a fresh infusion of capital.
</P>
<P>
   But with the company seeking investors, Kroll delayed making new
acquisitions, including several that were close to completion and
would have added to earnings immediately, people close to the
company said. With the end of the third quarter approaching and no
instant remedy in sight, the company had no choice but to warn that
earnings would fall short.
</P>
<P>
   O'Halloran, the Warburg Dillon Read analyst, said that even with
the turmoil at the company, he expected that any purchaser of Kroll
would have to pay between $19 and $24 a share, well above Friday's
closing price. ``It was probably overdone,'' he said of the
selloff.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that signals the magazine industry's growing
recognition of the potential vitality of multimedia, Thomas Rogers,
the president of NBC cable who expanded the NBC network into the
cable and Internet markets, will be named chief executive of
Primedia Inc. on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time that one of the major magazine publishing
companies has hired a chief executive with an extensive Internet
resume.
</P>
<P>
   Primedia owns more than 200 publishing properties _ from New
York and Seventeen magazines to highly specialized publications
like National Hog Farmer and Fire Chief _ and video businesses,
including Channel One, the television news channel provided to 8
million students at 12,000 high schools in the United States. In
1998, the company had sales of $1.5 billion and earnings of $330
million. The leveraged buyout firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts _
headed by Henry R. Kravis, the founding partner _ controls just
under 80 percent of Primedia's stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, what is really needed for us is to become a
full-service media company,'' Kravis said. ``That means not just
print, not just television, not just the Internet, but we need to
take the assets that we have and really go into the new
technologies. Tom brings to Primedia the leadership capability that
is so important, and the respect of the media world that comes from
founding CNBC and MSNBC.''
</P>
<P>
   Other leaders in the magazine industry like Time Inc., Hearst
Magazines, Hachette Filipacchi and Conde Nast, have tried to figure
out the way to translate a magazine's assets onto the Internet;
none have done so with any great success.
</P>
<P>
   At NBC, Rogers became a strong advocate for new media, even
ruffling some feathers in the network's executive suites. He made
the company less dependent on income from the network alone.
Rogers, who began his career as legal counsel to the House of
Representatives subcommittee on telecommunications, headed NBC's
move into the cable television by founding CNBC and later MSNBC, in
cooperation with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   William F. Reilly, the former chairman and chief executive of
Primedia, announced his resignation in July and left earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, Rogers engineered several low-cost deals
in which NBC bought stakes in Internet start-ups. Last year, he
joined NBC with Cnet, acquiring a piece of Cnet's Snap navigation
hub with an option to expand ownership to 60 percent. Two weeks
ago, Rogers oversaw NBC's acquisition of 32 percent of Paxson
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   In his new post, Rogers said his goal was to transform Primedia
from a magazine concern with little Internet exposure into a
magazine company with a big Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   In Standard and Poor's annual publishing survey for 1998,
Primedia was ranked as the sixth-largest magazine company in terms
of magazine revenue, behind Time Inc., Hearst Magazines, Advance
Publications (owner of Conde Nast), Reed Elsevier and the Thomson
Corp. But despite its ranking, Rogers said, Primedia was ``not that
well-known a company.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``This is a collection of terrific assets, assets that
in their existing sectors perform very nicely. But they have an
enormous amount of untapped potential as new-media properties. If
we can figure out how they relate to the new-media businesses _ by
that I mean the Internet or video or digital convergence _ over
time we can create a highly integrated company which can, I think,
be a real leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said the natural appeal of Primedia's magazines to
Internet users was their highly focused nature. American Baby,
Modern Bride, Automobile and the Primedia guides like New Home
Guides and Apartment Guides, ``all address central turning points
in life: getting married, buying a car, having a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he plans to develop the company's
business-to-business Internet sites as well as its electronic
commerce division. ``E-commerce is the golden goose of the
Internet,'' he said. ``It's not just about advertising and
subscriber revenue. We need consumers to look to the Internet as a
place for goods and services and rely on it in a day-to-day way
that supplants all kinds of brick-and-mortar approaches.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mark Mooradian, senior analyst for Jupiter Communications, said:
``All of the major magazine companies seem to have taken a wrong
turn down the `we're going to establish a major portal site'
strategy. Time did it with Pathfinder. Hearst did it with Home
Arts.'' He added, ``Primedia hasn't done much of anything. The
great growth opportunity is to get the vertical category that is
your expertise and own that, create commerce on it and sell highly
targeted advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Wolf, a media analyst and senior partner at Booz,
Allen &AMP; Hamilton, said Primedia's highly focused nature made it a
natural for expansion into the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look across the major magazine groups, they are still
really in their infancy in developing these Web businesses,'' Wolf
said, though he had praise for Time and Hearst, which has
affiliations with popular sites like Women.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primedia has a more natural audience for some of their Web
sites because many of their publications are enthusiast magazines,
which have a natural constituency. If you're hog farmer, you want
your latest hog news, and you're willing to pay for it,'' Wolf
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said he had no immediate plans for changes at any of the
Primedia magazines. ``I am not an expert on New York magazine,'' he
said. ``But as a general matter, I want to see all the Primedia
properties grow. I think some of the consumer franchises _ and New
York magazine has a strong consumer franchise _ each have different
ways to tap into that. Seventeen magazine is well suited for the
hot teen demo, which everyone is clamoring for. Automobile
magazine, well, obviously buying cars on the Internet has become an
enormous industry at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Editors and creative people at magazines like New York need
and deserve an awful lot of latitude in terms of what's going on in
the market and how to respond to it,'' he continued. ``I hope to
say to them, ``Here are new ways to take your creativity and take
it out onto the marketplace and expand your franchise even more.'''

NIKE, LONG WARY OF E-MARKETERS, LINKS UP WITH FOGDOG
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
(nk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nike Inc., which has consistently blocked Web-only stores from
selling its goods, has reversed its stand and will let Fogdog
Sports, an online sporting goods dealer, sell the full Nike product
line.
</P>
<P>
   But Nike extracted a high price for the right to buy its shoes:
Warrants to acquire 12 percent of Fogdog's shares.
</P>
<P>
   Nike is the first of the big athletic shoemakers to forge a pact
with a retailer that sells goods only on the Web. And its
imprimatur may cast a favorable light on Fogdog, a 3-year-old
company with less than $10 million in annual sales. Fogdog, based
in Redwood City, Calif., filed for a public stock offering on
Friday just as the Nike deal was closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nike is the 800-pound gorilla in the industry,'' said Timothy
Harrington, Fogdog's chief executive. He said that the company's
growth had been slowed because, until now, the only Nike goods it
had been able to offer had come from other retailer's overstocks
and other unofficial channels.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Fogdog hopes it can recoup the cost of the deal from
consumers _ who will find a broader selection _ and more
importantly from investors, who may see the Nike swoosh logo as an
indicator of the potential of Fogdog's stock.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time an Internet start-up has given away
stock to a supplier in order to validate its business model. Before
going public early this year, Priceline.com, the
offer-your-own-price shopping site, gave warrants for about 10
percent of the company's shares to Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   The sporting goods category, which has been slow to develop on
the Internet, has seen a flurry of activity this year. Most notably
a small Philadelphia company called Global Sports arranged to
create online stores for a half-dozen large sporting goods
retailers, including Sports Authority, Athlete's Foot and Sports
Chalet.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rubin, the chief executive of Global Sports, said he
thought Fogdog's strategy was flawed and risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never in a million years give any stock in my company
to a manufacturer,'' he said. ``What will they say when Reebok and
New Balance come and say, `What percentage do we get?'''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said Nike was the only manufacturer that will get
such a deal. ``Nike is the only company with double-digit market
share,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until now all of the big footwear brands declined to sell their
wares to Internet stores. Their position was similar to the
rationale of other manufacturers with high-end brands, including
Sony and Ralph Lauren, that had not wanted to risk diluting the
value of their brands by distributing them through inexperienced
entrepreneurs using untested technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a lot of online retailers who were not putting the
right emphasis on product presentation,'' said Mary Kate Buckley,
the Nike vice president who looks after its Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Nike thought that it would have to limit the
number of online retailers much more tightly than it did for local
stores. And so the company wanted to choose Web dealers carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bricks-and-mortar partners offer a convenient location
where customers can feel the product quality and try products on,''
she said. ``When you move to the Web, you present products in two
dimensions, take away the local convenience. So we were concerned
that over time if everyone is selling the same thing online, the
only difference would be price.''
</P>
<P>
   So Nike moved slowly, first by allowing some of the larger
chains of bricks-and-mortar sporting goods stores _ like Venator
Group's Foot Locker and Copeland Sports, a California chain _ to
sell Nike products on their Web sites. But even this was tentative.
Nike recently stopped selling to Copeland's Shopsports.Com.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not meeting our marketing standards,'' Ms. Buckley
said, declining to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Nike started selling about half of its various shoe
models and 20 percent of the rest of its products directly to
consumers through the Nike.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, when Fogdog came back to Nike with another of its
steady stream of requests to distribute the Nike line, Nike was
intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   Fogdog said it would maintain its policy of not discounting
products below the manufacturers' suggested minimums. Moreover,
Nike judged that Fogdog was becoming the leading online company in
the category.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were showing us business plans, but Fogdog was
out there executing for three years,'' Ms. Buckley said.
</P>
<P>
   And Fogdog offered Nike a portion of its stock just before the
public offering.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Nike agreed to give Fogdog the support it gave to big
chains, including preferred prices, technical information, joint
marketing and other promotions. Nike will continue to expand its
own sales effort through Nike.com, but it agreed not to sell to any
other pure Internet company, including all of sites being developed
by Global Sports, for at least six months.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin of Global Sports said he believed that Nike would soon
choose to support his venture, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our six partners are all among Nike's top 20 accounts,'' he
said. ``Nike needs to support them, and they need to be on the
Internet in order to survive in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Buckley acknowledged that this arrangement was sure to cause
some consternation among Nike's other retailers. But she predicted
that it would ultimately be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a big commitment to sporting goods
retailing,'' she said. ``The sporting goods industry has been slow
to adapt to the Web. This will be a jump-start.''

 &HT;    Martin cruises to victory at Dover
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. _ Mark Martin hasn't got time for the pain,
especially when he is winning a race.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who is suffering from two degenerating disks and has
scheduled off-season back surgery, cruised to an easy victory in
Sunday's MBNA Gold 400 at Dover Downs International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   It was Martin's third consecutive victory in the fall Dover race
and second of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling no pain right now,'' Martin said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie sensation Tony Stewart continued his hot streak as the
runner-up, followed by Winston Cups points leader Dale Jarrett and
promising rookie Matt Kenseth. Stewart has reeled off back-to-back
finishes in second place after winning at Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   For Martin, Sunday's ride down victory lane allowed him to pass
Bobby Labonte for second in the point standings. Jarrett has built
a seemingly insurmountable 257-point advantage with seven races
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one more down, we're counting them off,'' Jarrett said.
``We just have to keep having these type of days. It'd be nice to
win, but if we don't and can get top fives we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's long-time back problem, which he recently termed as
``intolerable,'' has been only one of several miseries for the Ford
No. 6 driver this past summer. He lost an uncle and close friend in
recent months, and is still mourning over the death of his father
last year. Martin also broke several bones in a Daytona wreck
during practice on July 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a bad day, (all those things) bother me, like after
Richmond (35th finish) and New Hampshire (17th),'' Martin said.
``But on a good day, it's not so bad. Everybody has tests in their
life and my life has been awfully good. So just the last 12 months
have been a little more of test for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin plans to have surgery Nov. 22, the day after the
season-ending NAPA 500 in Atlanta. Martin canceled the operation at
the last minute during the previous off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scheduled, I might chicken out (again) but I sure need it
and I can't wait until I end my racing career to do it,'' Martin
said. ``It's unfortunate with the recovery time that it pushes me
right into Daytona (opening racing for 2000 season).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gonna be tough, but it needs to be done for me to face
the great years I have left in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's other victory this year was also at Dover Downs,
capturing the MBNA Platinum 400 on June 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how bad I wanted to win (Sunday's race),''
Martin said. ``We have run well this summer, but we haven't been a
contender to win ... I haven't felt like I could take a race.''

 &HT;    Falcons face third loss in match against Rams
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Joe Namath returned to the NFL Sunday, wearing a
Rams uniform with the name of Kurt Warner on his back.
</P>
<P>
   In his spare time _ he had plenty _ the St. Louis quarterback
helped dig a deep hole for the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was Warner, doing his best Namath impersonation,
who led the Rams (2-0) to a 35-7 blowout of Atlanta. He passed for
three touchdowns, ran for one and bragged about it afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Warner wasn't the only imposter at the Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are 0-3 and bear no resemblance to the team that
went 16-3 last year on the way to Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   Already playing without running back Jamal Anderson, who is out
for the season with a torn right anterior cruciate knee ligament,
and wideout Tim Dwight, who pulled his hamstring during warm-ups,
the Falcons also lost quarterback Chris Chandler, who left with
3:13 left in the second quarter with a reinjured hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were behind 28-0 when Chandler exited, after the
Rams scored on their first four possessions and outgained Atlanta
311-67 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   That warm fuzzy team chemistry thing is taking a big hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we decide to come together as a team, the better we are
going to be,'' wide receiver Terance Mathis said. ``Once people
realize, again, it's us against the world like last year _ when we
didn't worry about anything or anybody but each other _ it's going
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, it looked like 11 Falcons against the world, and the
world won.
</P>
<P>
   Warner wasn't sacked all day and rarely was pressured while
triggering an opening drive that went 80 yards in 17 plays that
took 10:13.
</P>
<P>
   Then the defense, the only salvation in opening losses to
Minnesota and Dallas, joined the caravan south. St. Louis had 442
yards and converted 10-of-14 third downs. Warner threw touchdown
passes of 38, 46, and 17 yards _ all in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Graziani (14-of-22, 152 yards, first career touchdown pass,
no interceptions) played well in relief of Chandler, putting
together a 99.1 passer rating. It didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   This does: While getting ready for a home game against
Baltimore, the Falcons face long odds in trying to join the 1998
Bills, the '95 Lions, the '92 Chargers, the '82 Bucs, and the '81
Jets as teams that began the season 0-3 yet made the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had all the answers, we wouldn't be 0-3,'' said coach Dan
Reeves, who was even-mannered in defeat. ``There's a lot of things
happening right now, and when you play poorly, that magnifies
itself.''

 &HT;    U.S. retakes Ryder Cup with historic last-day rally
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ OK, pay them whatever they want. Put the
checks in the mail and don't spare the zeroes.
</P>
<P>
   And throw in a cash bonus for Justin Leonard, whose 45-foot putt
on the 17th hole at The Country Club on Sunday completed the
grandest comeback in Ryder Cup history. The United State defeated
Europe 14 1/2-13 1/2 with a performance that defied everything
logical about match play and its unyielding pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Accused of being fragmented by a play-for-pay issue last month,
the U.S. team came out Sunday and proved everyone wrong. Maybe the
next move should be the PGA of America's. If they can play this way
just for pride, imagine what they might do for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all happened like a dream,'' said Ben Crenshaw, the U.S.
captain. ``It's indescribable. It transcends any monetary value.
You play with your heart and your soul and brain. These are 12 of
the greatest guys I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable,'' Tiger Woods said. ``A dream come true.
They came out with courage and guts and got the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all believed it last night,'' said Hal Sutton, referring to
a U.S. team meeting Saturday night, when it was behind 10-6. ``We
all cried in the room. This was a family. This was a team. This was
history being made today. This is the greatest moment in golf right
now, and I'm just happy to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben kept saying, `We can do this. I've got a good feeling
about it,''' said Davis Love III. ``I kept thinking, `Golly, I hope
this doesn't come back to haunt him.'''
</P>
<P>
   The ending scene resembled one from a Braves locker room in the
early 1990s. Crenshaw's silver hair was soaked in champagne foam.
David Duval went on a hug rampage. On the roof of The Country Club,
American players retreating from the chaos sprayed the bubbly down
below. Heavily favored because of their domination in the world
rankings but on the verge of another loss to Europe, the Yanks were
acting as though a lottery had been won.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in as massive underdogs,'' Scotland's Colin
Montgomerie said, ``and we gave America a hell of a fright.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a total love fest. The Europeans expressed anger about
the general fan conduct in the gallery and the Americans' premature
celebration at the 17th green, after Leonard's putt triggered
hysteria among his charging teammates. Europe's Jose Maria
Olazabal, who could have halved the hole with a matching birdie,
``called it very sad to see'' and an ``ugly picture.'' United
States players and Crenshaw apologized for the celebration, but did
not feel it affected the outcome of the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the controversy was, except that we were
enjoying it and they weren't,'' Leonard said. ``I don't think
anyone stepped in Jose's line.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger story, of course, was the U.S. comeback. As
impressive as the lopsided first six victories _ by Tom Lehman (3
and 2 over Lee Westwood); Sutton (4 and 2 over Darren Clarke); Phil
Mickelson (4 and 3 over Jarmo Sandelin), Love (6 and 5 over Jean
Van de Velde); Woods (3 and 2 over Andrew Coltart) and Duval (5 and
4 over Jesper Parnevik) _ the unexpected plays came later. Mark
O'Meara's loss to Padraig Harrington was negated by Steve Pate's
victory against Miguel Angel Jimenez. Jeff Maggert's loss to Paul
Lawrie was negated by Jim Furyk's upset 4 and 3 victory against
rookie sensation Sergio Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   With eight points earned from singles, crunch time came down to
the Olazabal-Leonard and Montgomerie's-Payne Stewart matches. The
U.S. needed only to halve one of them and nearly clinched it when
Leonard, so ineffective in team play and 4-down to Olazabal after
11 holes, sank the uphill 45-footer from the front of the 17th
green. The half-point materialized when Olazabal missed from 25
feet. Montgomerie won when it no longer counted, on a conceded
birdie putt from Stewart, who spared the heckled Scot another time
over the ball.
</P>
<P>
   No Ryder Cup team from either side had ever trailed by four
points going into singles and won. No American team had ever
trailed on U.S. soil after two days and won.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody's laughing at Crenshaw any longer. While every sane
soul in Massachusetts figured a third straight European victory was
in the books, Crenshaw, who had managed a second Masters victory
through some divine guidance in 1995, said fate would take over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stunned,'' said Crenshaw, who had kissed the ground of the
place where he competed as a junior player in 1968. ``I'll tell
you, it's in the trees _ it's fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain to be criticized for not playing Coltart, Van de Velde
or Sandelin until singles and watching them be thumped, European
captain Mark James said, ``I think we were outplayed. I don't think
we were outmaneuvered. That's what you've got to do in this game,
ride the streak, and they rode the streak all too well today.''

CROWD FAVORITE GARCIA TAKES THE LOSS HARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The dream run of Sergio Garcia at the Ryder
Cup got a rude awakening Sunday, but the 19-year-old phenom from
Spain kept his composure and didn't let a bad day stop him from
having a good time.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he was three down to Jim Furyk and facing elimination,
Garcia continued to crack jokes, chat up his fans, and personally
acknowledge their cheers with a tip of the hat or a wink.
</P>
<P>
   Only after he was eliminated and waiting with his countrymen on
the 18th green for the final matches to conclude did he break down
in tears, the emotion of the stunning American turnaround finally
getting to him.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of stunning golf, racking up victory after
victory with partner Jesper Parnevik, Garcia's game deserted him
against Furyk. He struggled with accuracy from tee to green and
never seemed to get on track. Of the 15 holes he played, he hit
only eight in regulation, forcing him to scramble on the other
seven holes. He had only one birdie all day long.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th hole was typical of his tough day. He knocked his drive
far right into a patch of evergreen trees, ending up five inches
behind a huge tree root. Garcia sighed when he got to his ball and
ignored the laughter of some American fans, delighting in his
misfortune and daring him to make the same sort of miraculous tree
shot he made at the PGA Championship at Medinah, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no miracles on this day for Garcia. His only shot
was to take a wedge and chip the ball back into the fairway. He
still managed a bogey and succeeded in halving the hole when Furyk
hit his approach shot poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Only once did Garcia lose his cool, on the par-4 13th. After a
solid drive, he hit his approach shot into the right bunker. Angry,
he then took another vicious swing with his club, taking a huge
divot out of the turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you, it was different without playing with
Jesper,'' he said. ``I just did my best. I felt maybe a little
tired when I was three down, but I was trying. I was trying all the
time to help my team.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates seemed to anoint him the European player of the
match. With partner Parnevik he won three matches and halved a
fourth. But he seemed to run out of gas _ and shots _ Sunday. The
slow, steady consistency of Furyk was just too much for him to
handle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his amiable personality made him a crowd favorite.
Everywhere he went there were chants of ``Sergio,'' all of which
brought a smile to his face. And even meeting with the press after
the team's devastating loss, he was still cracking jokes and having
a good time with his buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of myself and all of the team. I think we did a
great job,'' he said. ``And once you play a Ryder Cup, you realize
how big this is.''

COMMENTARY: A CHILL GROWS IN BROOKLYN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Double parentheses should be set as brackets.)

 By BOB HERBERT

<P>
   NEW YORK _ More mayoral hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   This time Rudolph Giuliani, who has only a passing acquaintance
with the First Amendment, is determined to protect us from some
nasty pictures at an exhibition. And if the only way to do that is
to cripple a terrific cultural resource like the Brooklyn Museum of
Art _ well, that's a price the mayor is perfectly willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   He's already gone after the porn parlors. Now it's a museum.
Maybe he can find some nasty passages in some raunchy books and
close a few libraries.
</P>
<P>
   You don't think there's a chill in the air? Listen to this
courageous statement of support for artistic freedom put out
separately by the directors of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and
the Museum of Modern Art:
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that the Brooklyn Museum and the office of the
mayor are in a dialogue. Anything I might say could compromise
those talks.''
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to the respective directors, Philippe de
Montebello and Glenn D. Lowry, a mugging is not a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, of course, has little to lose. How do you lose when
one of the pictures in question is a collage that purports to show
the Blessed Virgin spattered with elephant dung? This exhibition
was made to order for the mayor's tyrannical, puritanical and
political tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   It's a no-brainer for him. And that's the problem. For hizzoner,
it's as if there were no larger principle involved.
</P>
<P>
   In London in the latter part of the 16th century, a law was
passed that barred the production of plays that did not have the
approval of the mayor and the aldermen. The author Victor L. Cahn
has written: ``In reaction to this ordinance, playhouses were built
just outside municipal limits and consequently beyond the realm of
jurisdiction, and here professional actors and playwrights truly
thrived.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the playwrights was a fellow named Shakespeare. The mayor
would have loved it. Try to imagine Giuliani with the power to
approve Shakespeare's plays. I've no doubt the Bard would have
high-tailed it to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940 the philosopher Bertrand Russell was offered a
professorship at the City College of New York. The puritans went
wild. It was understood that Russell favored the notion of men and
women having sex, even unmarried men and women.
</P>
<P>
   This caused normally mild hearts to thump and strong men to grow
faint. According to Russell's biographer, Ronald W. Clark, one
outraged New Yorker wrote to Mayor Fiorello La Guardia:
``Quicksands threaten! The snake is in the grass! The worm is busy
in the mind!''
</P>
<P>
   The writer begged the mayor for help: ``I beg Your Honour to
protect our youth from the baneful influence of him of the poisoned
pen _ an ape of genius, the devil's minister of men.''
</P>
<P>
   La Guardia, a hero to Giuliani, was happy to oblige. A clownish
judge blocked the appointment when a lawsuit was filed that
described Russell as ``lecherous, libidinous, lustful, venerous,
erotomaniac, aphrodisiac,'' etc. La Guardia promptly cut off
funding for the professorship and forbade city lawyers to appeal
the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   La Guardia's action was disgraceful and one of his top aides,
Charles Culp Burlingham, did not try to hide his dismay. Thomas
Kessner, in his biography of La Guardia, wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``As usual Burlingham put it best: `Why should a man with your
record in a free country do to the CCNY what the Nazis have done to
Heidelberg and Bonn? ... Your attempts to dispose of the case while
it was in the courts was bad enough; but to prevent the Board ((of
Higher Education)) appealing to higher courts is far worse. It is
not like you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Artistic freedom? Intellectual freedom? These are terms empty of
meaning to some politicians. Giuliani appears to enjoy the chilling
effect he has on artistic and intellectual enterprises. He likes to
exhibit his raw, naked power.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal John O'Connor and the Catholic League are
understandably upset over the exhibition planned by the Brooklyn
Museum. And a healthy portion of the mayor's support comes from
Catholic voters. And Giuliani is no doubt personally offended by
some of the works to be displayed.
</P>
<P>
   That's enough for this mayor to come to the conclusion that a
museum should be brought to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   There is no larger principle.

ALBRIGHT ADDRESSES NEW WARNING TO INDONESIA
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met Sunday with
the man expected to lead an independent East Timor and warned
Indonesia that it risks losing America aid and investment unless it
protects refugees in areas it controls.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's warning was one of the strongest yet by Washington,
which has been reluctant to threaten sanctions against the world's
fourth most populous country and one vital to Asia's economy. It
was also the first time that Washington had made clear that it
would hold Jakarta accountable for behavior beyond the border of
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, in New York for the opening last week of the U.N.
General Assembly session, spoke about the threat facing 100,000 to
200,000 refugees who were forced into West Timor during a siege of
violence by militias backed by the Indonesian military. The
refugees are reportedly being threatened and attacked by militia
members who fled there as peacekeepers arrived in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on a report from her assistant secretary of state for
refugees, who has just been in East and West Timor, Albright said
that ``what she has reported to me is terribly troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   The assistant secretary, Julia Taft, said that while civilian
authorities in West Timor seemed genuinely concerned about the
refugees, it was evident that pro-Indonesian militias, in collusion
with the Indonesia army, had infiltrated refugee camps and were
intimidating people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government and armed forces of Indonesia should understand
that what happens in West Timor and to East Timorese living
elsewhere in Indonesia is as important to the United States as what
happens in East Timor itself,'' Albright said at a news conference
with the East Timorese leader, Jose Alexandre Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday a senior administration official said in an interview,
``We believe that the key to getting Indonesia to accept'' a
peacekeeping force, ``was the threat of severe consequences if they
didn't _ primarily loss of economic aid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What the secretary is saying is, Look, you don't just check
the box and get out of the East Timor situation simply by
evacuating your troops and turning it over to the U.N. if terrible
things are going on in West Timor,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright will deliver the same message to Indonesia's foreign
minister, Ali Alatas, on Monday, aides said. She will tell him that
the United States is also concerned about the government's response
to protests in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, and elsewhere in
the country. Aides added that she will tell the government that it
must continue to adhere to its promises of democratic change.
</P>
<P>
   But the government of President B.J. Habibie is not the only
player, and American officials also intended their strong message
to be heard by Megawati Sukarnoputri. Her party will hold a
plurality of seats in a new national parliament, and she hopes to
be elected president in indirect elections later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Megawati, the daughter of Indonesia's first president,
Sukarno, is thought to be a nationalist in her father's mold and
may attract military nationalists to her cause.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao, who was imprisoned in Indonesia for seven years before
being released in August, pressed in their meeting Sunday for
American attention to the safety of East Timorese scattered not
only in West Timor but also across other Indonesian islands,
Albright's aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao, known as Xanana, is in New York to meet with
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and other U.N. officials who are
preparing to take over the administration and defense of East Timor
after a new Indonesian parliament assembles and ratifies the East
Timorese vote for independence. After the East Timorese elect a
government, the United Nations plans to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Albright last met with Gusmao when she was visiting Indonesia in
March. Indonesians and some foreign governments see him as the most
likely leader of an independent East Timor. He has been more
moderate than Jose Ramos-Horta, who has led an independence
campaign from exile. Ramos-Horta was also at Sunday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao, 53, was a military and political hero of the long
guerrilla war against Indonesia, which began even before Indonesian
troops seized the territory in 1975 after administrators from a
collapsing Portuguese empire fled.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao was brought into three-way talks between Indonesia,
Portugal and the United Nations as Indonesia moved toward allowing
the East Timorese to vote in the referendum on their future.

AMERICANS' BAD MANNERS PEEVE EUROPEAN PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Europe's Ryder Cup players, heralded for
their gregariousness, their ease in chatting with fans, and obvious
team spirit, exited The Country Club rankled by a lack of American
hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans were disgusted, first and foremost, by the
American squad's overzealous celebration on the green that erupted
when Justin Leonard drained a 45-foot putt on the 17th hole,
essentially clinching the championship. And, while commending most
of the 30,000-plus fans who ringed the course each day, the Euros
were peeved by a small but vocal group of hecklers, many of whom
targeted Colin Montgomerie for their nastiest insults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was very sad to see,'' said Spain's Jose Maria
Olazabal, referring specifically to the band of jumping US players
who hugged, guffawed, and otherwise held up his putt attempt after
Leonard's sensational putt. ``It was very ugly to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Even-tempered but firm in his remarks, Olazabal repeatedly
stated that he didn't want his words perceived as excuse making.
The celebration didn't lead to his missing the putt, he said,
emphasising over and over that the Americans played better and
deserved the victory.
</P>
<P>
   But the US team, said Olazabal, should have been more mindful of
golf etiquette and some fans should be ashamed by the words that
came out of their mouths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheer for your team all you want,'' said Olazabal, who
frittered away a 4-up lead, ``just show respect for your
opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a news conference attended by the American squad, a
diplomatic Leonard apologized for the outburst and said he would
shoulder full responsibilty. He was caught up in the excitement of
the moment, he said, and wishes he had jumped up and down rather
than run to embrace the charging troupe of Yanks that included
players, wives, caddies, and hangers-on.
</P>
<P>
   One reporter, in a question posed to Tom Lehman, said some
European members said Lehman should be embarrassed by his behavior
on 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never ill intent on anyone's part,'' said Lehman.
``In retrospect, I wish we all had jumped up and down in place
rather than on the side of the green. But I'm not going to
apologize for being excited.''
</P>
<P>
   European captain Mark James also said he didn't like the
outbreak on 17, but he also wasn't expecting, nor would he request,
an apolgoy from US captain Ben Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Ben was responsible for that behavior,'' said
James. ``So I wouldn't expect an apology from Ben. It's not
something I'm very concerned about. I agree with everthing Jose
said. ``And I'd like to think it wouldn't happen with my players.''
</P>
<P>
   Although not asked, Crenshaw quickly offered an apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something we are proud of,'' said Crenshaw, a man
whose sincerity during Ryder Cup week often led him to tears.
``We're sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, who was playing a hole behind the Olazabal-Leonard
match, caught glimpses of the celebration as he approached 17.
Later, as he came striding to the green, he said to TV commentator
David Flaherty, ``I don't know how you live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Montgomerie added, ``I couldn't believe what I was seeing
on the 17th.''
</P>
<P>
   European star Jesper Parnevik, who lives in Florida, was
disappointed by the taunts from the crowd Montgomerie was subjected
to during the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the little American on the European tour. I live here,''
said Parnevik. ``It was embarrassing to hear all the heckling at
Monty. I understand Americans rooting for Americans, but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Payne Stewart expressed similar distaste for the heckling.
``What's he got, a big bull's-eye on his back? He doesn't deserve
it. It's not golf.'' Some of that heckling, said Stewart, led to
some hecklers being ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Classy and calm, Olazabal said he raised his objection to the
outbreak on 17 because there will be another Ryder Cup in two
years, and many more to follow. He hopes the game's etiquette will
be preserved and the ugly heckling will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be to the benefit of golf, if they manage to behave
just a little bit better,'' he said. ``I understand in a way what
happened (on 17). They were carried by their emotions. At the same
time, it's not a nice situation for us. I'm not trying to find
excuses. I just think if we respect each other a little more, it
would be good for everyone. What I am trying to say is a simple
fact. I mean, what would you do or say, or what would an American
player do or say, if a European had done the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a simple matter of respect.''

TEARS SAY IT ALL FOR CRENSHAW

   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Gentle Ben? Yes, as always. But also, it
turns out, Passionate Ben. And Inspirational Ben. And in full
public view Sunday, Choked Up Ben.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy ratified by victory, and his team all of a sudden
performing like a well-oiled, selfless machine, Captain Ben
Crenshaw found time Sunday to do in public what some of his team
members said he frequently did in private. He got all broken up. He
said, while casting his eyes heavenward, that fate had selected his
team for victory.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where leaders are urged to be emotionless lest they
fail, Crenshaw blubbered. He broke down on the 17th green after
Justin Leonard's historic putt. His voice quavered and tears
moistened his eyes as he stood behind the 18th green after the last
match ended.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he became so emotional that he said the fate that
had predetermined his team for victory might rest in the mighty oak
trees that overshadow The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative-appearing Texan, it turned out, is a '90s kind
of guy. As the victories rolled in, Crenshaw seemed to be hugging
everyone within reach.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the emotion so on display in the public
Crenshaw was often visible in private to the team he apparently
inspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never gave us a rah-rah speech,'' his star pupil, Hal
Sutton, said. ``Everytime he spoke to us there was a quiver in his
voice. He kept saying, `I believe in you all.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But behind every successful emotional leader lies a clear-eyed,
clear-headed strategist. And Crenshaw had his. Despite all the
public notice to a team of pampered athletes who had little
understanding of, much less any use for, teamwork, Crenshaw
insisted the facts suggested otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   His 12 players, he said _ matter-of-factly and not I-told-you-so
in tone _ had ``an indomitable spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not ever lose sight of what we were doing. They
believed in themselves,'' he said. And despite widespread sentiment
that his charges were ill-fitted for such a team event, he said it
was only the extraordinary quality of the European play that left
the US team at such a deficit entering the singles matches.
</P>
<P>
   His players, he said, ``believed in themselves. They knew how
close these matches were _ despite some fantastic play by the
European team.'' Many of the matches the Europeans won Friday and
Saturday, he reminded reporters, were by ``razor-thin margins.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the US team agreed Saturday night that they
had a chance. ``I said to them, `Look, we can whitewash them.'
That's exactly what we all agreed to try to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But at times, it seemed that Crenshaw was convinced his team
would win no matter what. The ``chain reaction'' generated by his
team's victories in the first six singles matches that were
decided, he said, ``happened like a dream force pulling us
together.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Leonard's long putt that clinched victory, Crenshaw said,
``I think the ball was just destined to go in.''
</P>
<P>
   But fate and passion aside, there lurked just beneath Crenshaw's
tear-stained demeanor a sense that emotions seldom interfered with
his judgment. In one rare cold-blooded comment afterward, Crenshaw
remarked: ``I'm a pretty good judge of talent.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR BETTER OR WORSE, METS SEEM CALM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ They do not have the thousand-mile stare of
soldiers that James Jones once described. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   They seem like perfectly stable professional athletes who have
just had a bad week _ a very bad week _ but are not haunted by it.
At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to do. Just play the game,'' said Robin
Ventura, one of the many adults in the Mets' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no crude outbursts in public, no snarling at
fans or reporters, little grim inward brooding while staring into a
locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure everybody is frustrated with the way things have
gone,'' said John Olerud, another grown-up. ``I'm sure nobody
thought we'd lose six in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   If it keeps up, the Mets will be remembered for an epic
collapse. After the 3-2 loss to the Phillies on Sunday, they would
discover on their ride home that the Reds came from behind and now
have a one-game lead for the last spot in the playoffs. The Mets
have squandered all of their lead, and more.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect them to go down cursing their fate. This may not be
about character or personality. They may not be a rowdy bunch that
absolutely refuses to be beaten, like the old Fightin' A's in
Oakland in the '70s or the feisty Yankees of the
Munson-Nettles-Reggie-Catfish era right afterward.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Mets do not yet resemble ancient mariners
like the Philadelphia Phillies of 1964 who lost 10 straight games
in the last two weeks of the season. Those Phillies were plagued by
injuries, could see their fate coming at them like the grim reaper,
no matter how much they struggled against it.
</P>
<P>
   These Mets do not carry any overt sign of a hex, so maybe it is
merely a matter of a day's rest, and back to work again _ against
the Braves, the same brutes who waxed them three straight in
Atlanta last week to start this whole downhill lurch.
</P>
<P>
   If there is anything to be done, nobody seems to know what it
is. Bobby Valentine made a minor juggle of his lineup on Sunday _
there is some confusion about whether Edgardo Alfonzo was wild
about dropping from second to sixth _ but that had little to do
with the way the Phillies plucked balls off the carpet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahh, you make your own luck,'' Valentine said with a sheepish
smile.
</P>
<P>
   The manager did not approach his weird outburst of Saturday,
when he said he would deserve to be fired if the Mets lost. Now he
seemed almost calm, a man who had done all he could.
</P>
<P>
   It was suggested that maybe it was time to stand in the middle
of the clubhouse and rage against the fates.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes you think I haven't done that?'' Valentine asked
reporters. ``Nah, I haven't. I saw some anger after the game today,
but that's only natural.''
</P>
<P>
   The time to pitch a royal tantrum might have been after
Saturday's loss, when the rap music was at full boom and a dozen
players devoured a huge box of luscious-looking soft-shell crabs in
the center of the clubhouse. Valentine could have heaved the
crustaceans the way Gene Mauch of the Phillies slung spareribs all
over the clubhouse during a slump, long before the 1964 collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, that doesn't work,'' Valentine said, adding that speeches
are dicey, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's phony stuff,'' Valentine said. ``I've been in
clubhouses where managers said things and we laughed. It's not some
magical thing.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the music was off and the players wolfed down a
totally prosaic clubhouse spread. They were hungry, but not sullen.
There was no clubhouse agitator appealing to their pride or their
anger, no Keith Hernandez stirring things up, no Pee Wee Reese
tossing off bland barbs, no Bob Gibsons and Bill Whites making
purposeful noise. That's not this kind of team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not one sentence, one speech,'' Valentine said. ``I don't
think this mix is bad. Look, we're in a very tough marketplace and
I think we're doing a fine job.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he saw any sign of tension on the team, Valentine said,
``We haven't had our deep counts,'' meaning the players might be
overanxious.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get extended at-bats, you still have to hit the ball,''
Ventura said, mildly disagreeing, but admitting the players looked
tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say we're going to have a hot streak in July,
because it's September,'' Ventura added.
</P>
<P>
   They tipped the clubhouse man, headed for the bus or their car
pools, no obvious gloom cloud hanging over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, boys, it's Tuesday,'' John Franco said, on his way out the
door. ``Everybody'll be smiling at the end of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the players have not yet grasped the severity of their
situation, but that is doubtful. They are too bright to miss the
numbers, and what history will say about them if this keeps up.

FUND-RAISING GAP FORCING QUAYLE TO DROP OUT, AIDE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Vice President Dan Quayle, convinced that he
would not be able to raise enough money to keep pace with Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner for the Republican
presidential nomination, has decided to drop out of the race, a
senior official with his campaign said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that Quayle had struggled to remain optimistic
about his chances of winning the nomination, but that a review of
his campaign's finances over the weekend had forced him to conclude
that the odds against him were insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Vice President Quayle was extremely bullish on the
campaign's progress nationally and in New Hampshire, it became
clear that he did not have the resources to compete effectively in
the 18 or so contests that occur in the 30 days following New
Hampshire,'' the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire holds the nation's first primary contest, and
Quayle had invested significant time, money and hope in doing well
there.
</P>
<P>
   But, the official said, Quayle came to realize that ``even a
strong showing or win there would not provide the momentum needed
to achieve ultimate victory. And he's always said that the moment
he concluded that the campaign could no longer secure victory, he
would not ask supporters to continue expending their time and
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said that Quayle decided to pull out of the race
after talking extensively this weekend with his campaign manager,
Kyle McSlarrow, and his wife, Marilyn. Quayle plans to announce his
decision at a news conference Monday in Phoenix, where he lives,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is the fourth Republican to drop out of the race.
Preceding him were Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, former Tennessee Gov.
Lamar Alexander and Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who also left
the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's exit narrows the field of Republican contenders to
eight, including the conservative television commentator Pat
Buchanan, who has said that he also might bolt the GOP to seek the
nomination of the Reform Party instead.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Quayle announced his candidacy in Huntington,
Ind., on April 14, it failed to catch fire. Like many other
candidates, he was eclipsed by Bush &UR; .  &LR;  Oddly, it was the Texas
governor's father, former President George Bush, who first put
Quayle on the national stage by picking him for the vice
presidency, which Quayle held from 1989 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But during those years, Quayle arguably became most famous for
his awkward, embarrassing verbal gaffes, and his campaign seemed in
part to be an uphill struggle to persuade enough voters to take him
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's fate seemed to be sealed when Quayle finished
eighth in a field of nine candidates who competed in Iowa's
nonbinding straw poll in mid-August. But advisers said that Quayle
was less troubled by his showing there than by the pace of his fund
raising, which lagged significantly behind that of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   By June 30, the end of the last fund-raising period, Quayle had
reported campaign contributions of $3.4 million. Bush, by contrast,
reported about $37 million, and has since gone over the $50 million
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also consistently led his Republican rivals in national
opinion polls by double-digit margins. Although one recent national
poll showed Quayle a very distant second, most others have put
Elizabeth Dole, the former president of the Red Cross, in that
position, and some have shown Quayle also trailing Sen. John McCain
of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The official with the Quayle campaign would not say whether
Quayle planned to endorse any of the other Republicans in the race.
He described Quayle as ``extremely disappointed, but, as many
people know, he possesses an indestructible optimism and faith in
the system.''

AN INDEX-FUND PIONEER TRIES LIFE AS AN ANGEL  
 E-COMMERCE IS GETTING A HIGH-OCTANE PUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
(lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems a leap across the chasm of investing. A man once called
the king of can't-beat-the-market index funds becomes a partner in
a so-called angel fund, which specializes in picking Internet
start-ups worthy of seed investments.
</P>
<P>
   But Fred Grauer, who headed the $575 billion Barclays Global
Investors funds until last year, contends that the two worlds of
investing are not so different. He notes that Barclays Global
Investors has 140 separate funds in its portfolio. ``Each one of
those was essentially a seed-level investment,'' said Grauer, 52.
``So I do have a lot of experience in working with innovative
businesses and getting them off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Grauer is officially starting Monday as a general partner in
Angel Investors LP. And Angel Investors itself is a vivid
illustration of both the changes that the Internet gold rush has
brought to Silicon Valley and the things that remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   For years, an angel investment meant the modest grubstake that a
new business required just to open its doors _ money that often
came from family and friends. The professional financing came
later, from venture capitalists, who would act as mentors to
fledgling companies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the huge money flows being directed at Internet
start-ups, Angel Investors represents an effort to make seed-stage
investing far more professional. Its first fund, which closed
earlier this year, is $30 million. Its second fund, scheduled to
close on Friday, is expected to raise $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Investors acts as a kind of farm team for the venture
capital firms, which no longer do as much early hand-holding of
young companies as they once did. Angel Investors typically invests
$200,000 to $400,000 in a start-up, nurtures it for three to six
months and then passes it along to the venture capital firms, while
retaining an ownership stake.
</P>
<P>
   What has not changed is the importance of the human network that
is Silicon Valley. Angel Investors amounts to an invitation-only
club with four general partners, including Grauer, and nearly 200
investors. The investors in the second Angel fund, for example,
include James Barksdale, former president of Netscape; Marc
Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape; Kim Polese, chief executive of
Marimba; Benjamin Rosen, chairman of Compaq Computer, and Esther
Dyson, editor of the newsletter Release 1.0.
</P>
<P>
   Grauer came to know Angel Investors' founder, Ron Conway, years
ago during a fund-raising drive at an elementary school in the
Silicon Valley community of Atherton, Calif. And last year he
renewed the contact when he was helping finance an Internet
start-up. ``I came to Angel Investors the classic Silicon Valley
way _ the network,'' he said.

   E-Commerce Is Getting a High-Octane Push
</P>
<P>
   Talk about self-serve. Tokheim Corp., the United States' largest
maker of gasoline pumps, is about to introduce a new line of
cyberpumps that would let customers get traffic updates, check the
weather and shop online while waiting for their tanks to fill.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco, a longtime Tokheim customer, will be the first to test
the new pumps early next year, most likely in metropolitan Chicago
and other parts of the Midwest, said Jacques St. Denis, Tokheim's
executive vice president for worldwide operations.
</P>
<P>
   The new pumps, each with a 10-inch liquid-crystal-display
touch-screen, are to be connected to the Web through a variety of
Internet access providers, arranged by individual gasoline
companies and content providers, which would be able to tailor the
services to different markets.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, for example, the pumps might promote merchandise
for sale in the station's convenience store; in others, customers
might be able to print coupons or shop online for mail-order
delivery, using the same credit-card information they have provided
to pay for their gas.
</P>
<P>
   At some stations that are adjacent to fast-food restaurants,
customers might be able to place food orders and have them
delivered to their cars while they are still parked at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   St. Denis said he expected that gas pumps would be able to let
customers check their e-mail and, eventually, to transmit data like
maps and traffic information directly to in-car receivers.
``Anything you can do on the PC, you'll be able to do at the gas
pump,'' he said. Except crash, one hopes.

TEXAN SAYS HE HELPED BUSH JOIN THE GUARD IN VIETNAM WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A former speaker of the Texas Legislature said Sunday
that during the Vietnam War he personally contacted a general in
the Texas Air National Guard to help George W. Bush attain a
pilot's slot in a Guard unit upon his graduation from college.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Sunday afternoon, Ben Barnes, the
former speaker, confirmed that he had acted on Bush's behalf more
than 30 years ago after he was asked to do so by a wealthy Houston
oilman, Sidney Adger, who was also a friend of Bush's father,
George Bush, then a congressman from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether Bush, now the governor of Texas and the
early front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination,
received preferential treatment in joining the Guard has also
arisen in a lawsuit in which Barnes is scheduled to be deposed on
Monday in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to testify to the truth in my deposition,'' Barnes
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes refused to discuss any of the specifics of his meeting
with Adger, but he said the Houston businessman ``didn't tell me
that the Bush family was telling him to do it.'' Barnes said that
he had received numerous other such requests for help, and that no
one in the Bush family ever sought his help on the matter or
contacted him about it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has repeatedly denied that he joined the National Guard to
avoid the draft. Pressed on the question in recent days, he has
said that if anyone ever exerted influence on his behalf, he did
not know about it. Bush has said that neither he nor his father
ever intervened, a position that has been seconded by his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush did not need, and did not ask, anybody for help,''
said Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign. ``He applied,
met the qualifications, was accepted, served proudly and according
to military evaluations was an accomplished fighter pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, 61, has been a major figure in Texas politics since he
was elected to the State House at age 22. He served as speaker, and
later as lieutenant governor, and President Johnson once predicted
that Barnes might make it to the White House. But he became
entangled in a state banking scandal, and though he was never
charged with a crime, his political career essentially ended.
</P>
<P>
   Now a businessman and lobbyist in Austin, Barnes is a major
figure in a federal lawsuit filed against Gtech, the company that
operates the Texas lottery. The suit, filed by Lawrence Littwin,
who was dismissed as director of the Texas lottery in 1997, centers
on alleged impropriety by Gtech. But lawyers for Littwin also want
to interview Barnes, a lobbyist for the company.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the lawyers have suggested in court papers that
Gtech was allowed to keep its state contract as a way of
maintaining Barnes' silence about Bush and the Guard.

LEONARD MOTIVATED FROM THE BROADCAST BOOTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Bob Riefke arrived for work, looking forward
to the supreme challenge that men in his profession live for. Then
he went looking for the boss. When he found Justin Leonard, Riefke
didn't like what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked a little down,'' said the caddie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `What's the matter?' But he said nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Riefke can put a club in his player's hand, tell him how many
breaks are in a putt, and which way the wind is blowing. He can
also tell when something is bugging Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew. So I said, `It's Johnny Miller, right?' And he said,
`Yes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Riefke grabbed Leonard's golf bag, slapped his player on the
back, and headed with him to the range. ``I said, `Don't worry
about it. Let's go prove them wrong.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Four hours and a few unthinkable putts later, they did. Four
hours and an improbable victory later, the goat horns had been
tossed away, an 0-4-2 Ryder Cup record was ancient history, and
Leonard was telling reporters, ``It's just a good thing I didn't go
home.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to a comment by Miller, an NBC commentator,
during Saturday's broadcast. When it was announced that Ben
Crenshaw had replaced Jeff Maggert with Leonard to play four-ball
with Hal Sutton, the US captain reasoned that it was a ``hunch.''
</P>
<P>
   The move raised eyebrows, for Sutton-Maggert had been a winning
team, and it led Miller to comment: ``My hunch is that Leonard
needs to go home and watch on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard read the comment before heading to The Country Club for
the singles matches and his spirits sunk. Riefke tried to give
Leonard and his psyche a lift. ``I told him we were in a perfect
spot in the lineup (out ninth against Jose Maria Olazabal) to make
an impact,'' said Riefke.
</P>
<P>
   Not in his wildest imagination could Riefke have envisioned
being so correct.
</P>
<P>
   But there they were, some four hours later, celebrating
something so small _ a mere half-point _ and something so coveted _
the Ryder Cup. But as much as it was a team victory, Leonard also
was celebrating a personal triumph, for he had done what his caddie
had told him to do. He had proven people wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He had rallied from 4 down through 11 holes to stun Olazabal.
His 45-foot birdie bomb on The Country Club's most historic hole,
the 17th, had put Leonard 1 up and ended a miraculous run of six
holes that enlivened a crowd that no one thought could get any
livlier.
</P>
<P>
   It had also carried Riefke to another memorable time, Royal
Troon in 1997, when Leonard overcame a five-shot deficit to win the
British Open. ``Deja vu,'' said Riefke. ``He had the big eyes and
the holes were big, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Take hole 14, for instance, where Leonard hit a 12-foot putt
that knocked some more life out of the Europeans. Olazabal had made
bogeys at 12 and 13 to help the American's cause, but now Leonard
took matters into his own hands.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, a 25-footer. All square.
</P>
<P>
   Two holes later, a 45-footer, up over a slope, turning right,
then disappearing into the cup and placing Leonard into golf lore.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour later, caddies and players, wives and assistant
captains had gathered on the balcony over the men's grill to
celebrate. Tiger Woods had champagne in one hand and his other arm
around Mike (Fluff) Cowan, his former caddie, and at any other time
this would have been big news. But for the first time in his pro
career, Woods was not the crowd's choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jus-tin. Jus-tin. Jus-tin.'' They chanted in unison.
</P>
<P>
   Then it grew louder. And had more of a beat to it. ``Jus-tin
Leo-nard. Jus-tin Leo-nard. Jus-tin Leo-nard.'' Champagne bottles
were everywhere and the player who stood tallest had the tallest
bottle of the bubbly.
</P>
<P>
   He held it high and had a smile that shined brighter than the
championship hardware that he had just helped win. Payne Stewart
grabbed Leonard, hugged him, and kissed him. No doubt Stewart told
him that he hadn't gone home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid has such a big heart,'' Riefke said. ``There probably
are some people who are more proud of him. But not many.''

AMERICANS DOMINATE IN SINGLES, RECAPTURE CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Ben Crenshaw's US team of superstars, which
had been embarrassed by a European team seemingly out of its class
when the competition began Friday morning, stormed out of oblivion
in splendid sunshine at The Country Club Sunday, rallying from a
seemingly insurmountable 4-point deficit to stun the Europeans and
regain the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   As Crenshaw wept, Justin Leonard put the British Open touch on
his majestic ride when he made an impossible 45-foot putt to send
his teammates into the biggest Boston joyride since Paul Revere
approached the Old North Church.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 10-6, entering Sunday's play, the Americans won eight
of 12 singles matches (including the first six of the day) and
halved another as they rode a wave of momentum to a 14 1/2-13 1/2
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal by four shots in
the ninth match, Leonard won four holes in a row starting at the
12th and made the putt heard 'round the world on 17th to send the
US team of seemingly uninspired robots into ecstacy. They cried.
They cheered. The cried. ``I've never seen such an indomitable
spirit of these guys,'' said Crenshaw. ``This is so indescribable.
We knew what we had to do. We are together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, who had won the last two Ryder Cups at Oak Hill
and Valderrama, carried a 6-2 lead out of Friday's
foursomes/four-ball matches and the teams played evenly the
following day. No team has come back from such a deficit. The
Europeans needed just 4 points to retain the cup that was first put
into competition by Samuel Ryder at Worcester CC in 1927. They
could only come up with 3 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   This was a US team torn apart by the issue of money, but it was
talent, emotion and genuine feeling that led to this triumph of
triumphs and one of sport's greatest comebacks. David Duval, who
had been criticized for his Ryder Cup comments regarding
compensation, roared to a 5-and-4 victory over European stalwart
Jesper Parnevik. ``I was sick and tired of everybody saying we
weren't a team,'' said Duval.
</P>
<P>
   Said Phil Mickelson, ``We not only won, we dominated. We won big
in the first four matches.''
</P>
<P>
   This was tryly American golf in its highest form. Tom Lehman
beat Lee Westwood of Great Britain, 3 and 2; Hal Sutton, who became
one of America's heroes, beat Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland, 4
and 2; Mickelson was a 4-and-3 winner over Jarmo Sandelin of
Sweden; Davis Love whipped Jean Van de Velde of France, 6 and 5 and
Tiger Woods won three holes in a row to close out the front side en
route to a 3-and-2 win over Andrew Coltart of Scotland. Duval made
it six straight.
</P>
<P>
   There were some eyebrows raised when European captain Mark James
sat down Sandelin, Van de Velde, and Coltart in the first four
matches and then sent them out to play matches No. 3, No. 4, and
No. 5. By the time Dubliner Padraig Harrington kept the European
hopes alive and eventually beat Mark O'Meara, 1 up, time was
drawing short. Steve Pate beat Spain's Miguel Angel Harrington, 2
and 1, and Leonard did his thing before losing the 18th hole to
halve the match.
</P>
<P>
   Payne Stewart, who set his sights on the Ryder Cup in January
and won the US Open at Pinehurst No. 2, bowed to European's iron
man Colin Montgomerie on the 18th hole. Jim Furyk had already
handed Spanish teenage sensation Sergio Garcia his first defeat
(3-1-1) in five matches with a 4-and-3 win. Scotsman Paul Lawreie,
who won the British Open at Carnoustie when Van de Velde let it
slip out of his hands, was decisive in a 4-and-3 win over Jeff
Maggert.
</P>
<P>
   This competition was rejeuvenated in 1979 when the Europeans
becaue a part of it, and players such Nick Faldo, Seve Ballesteros,
Bernard Langer, Ian Woosnam, and Olazabal joined the frame and came
of age. With the exception of Olazabal, the rest of the brethren
have passed the competition by. The Europeans still have a 4-3-1
edge in the past eight Cups and the point total is 98-98 in the
last seven.
</P>
<P>
   There was a large and boisterous crowd on hand for three days,
and the unfortunate part is they were too large and too boisterous.
They heckled Montgomerie, to the irritation of Stewart. They didn't
belong at The Country Club, they belonged in a different element.
Even the US players were caught up in it, swarming out to engulf
Leonard when he made his putt. Olazable still had a putt for a
halve, and the commotion was disconcerting.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't US golf at its collective best. There were too many
people permitted to crash the gates, too many spectators who tended
to spoil the show. First, the heckling of Montgomerie, who
acknowledges now that he plays up to it. ``I use it now as a
motivating factor,'' he said. ``I treat it as a compliment because
I must be good at this game. I have a lot of ambition in me and
that tends to bring it out.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in the group behind Olazabal. ``I couldn't believe what I
was seeing,'' said Montomerie. ``He still had a putt to halve. I
couldn't believe it cleared and he was left on his own to have a
putt. It was very, very difficut for everyone concerned. I still
think it speaks well of us that we came in here as massive
underdogs. I think what we did the first two days was
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Olazabal, ``I don't want to make a whole thing out of this.
The thing is it shouldn't have happened. We're playing a match.
We're trying to show respect to each other, and I don't think that
was the right thing to do. I understand there was a lot of emotion,
but at the same time you have to have your feet on the ground and
realize what the situation is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman was critiziced because he was of the ones who ran out to
embrace Leonard. ``What happened was unfortunate,'' said Lehman.
``In the excitement of the moment we all got excited. There was
never any ill intent on anybody's part in any way whatsoever. We
were excited. We probably wish we all would have jumped up and down
in place intead of runing down the wide of the green. But I'm not
going to apologize for being excited.''

NEW PENN STATION GETS PUSH WITH $160 MILLION IN U.S. LOANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., P.R., D.C.)  (js) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Providing a large piece of financial support for a
new Pennsylvania Station, federal officials are to announce Monday
that the project has been selected to receive $160 million in loans
through a new congressional program for transportation
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The loans, to be announced at the World Trade Center by senior
officials of the federal Department of Transportation, could
provide a critical step forward for the project, which would
convert the James A. Farley Building, the Beaux-Arts main post
office on Eighth Avenue, into the new station.
</P>
<P>
   The project has been widely endorsed by preservationists and
city officials as a means of reclaiming some of the grandeur of the
old Pennsylvania Station, which was demolished 36 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say it would also give the city a more attractive and
advanced terminal for Amtrak train service.
</P>
<P>
   While the financial assistance through the congressional
program, authorized under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance
and Innovation Act of 1997, would provide only part of the
estimated $750 million cost of the project, state and federal
officials said the loans would provide a needed financial and
political lift for the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Besides senior representatives of the Transportation Department,
officials expected to attend Monday's announcement include Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who has been the project's most outspoken
advocate for years, and Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, who was a
co-sponsor of the transportation finance act.
</P>
<P>
   Charles A. Gargano, the senior economic adviser to Gov. George
E. Pataki and the chairman of Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment
Corporation, said in an interview that the federal loans would
``fill a huge gap'' in paying for the project.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The federal financing, to be extended at interest rates below
those normally paid to banks or holders of municipal bonds,
includes a $140 million loan and a $20 million line of credit.
</P>
<P>
   Gargano, whose redevelopment corporation was formed to oversee
the project in 1996 with commitments of $75 million from the state
and $25 million from the city, said the federal loan package would
make it easier to raise more money through the sale of municipal
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even though all the necessary financing is not in place, Gargano
said the renovation of the Farley Building would begin next year
and be completed in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The original Pennsylvania Station was completed in 1911 and
demolished in 1963, provoking such impassioned protest that it
remains a rallying point for preservationists.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The final price for the project remains to be determined.
Gargano and other officials acknowledged in recent months that the
budget was being inflated by a construction boom in New York City,
which has pushed up the cost of labor and materials. With many of
the bills for architectural designs and other preliminary work
already paid, Gargano said in May that the remaining budget was
$484 million, but he revised that figure on Friday to $550 million.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the project are seeking other contributions,
including a $60 million federal grant that Clinton has said he
would ask Congress to authorize before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the project's financing under the 1997 act,
federal officials said they would also use Monday's ceremony in
Manhattan to designate four other transportation projects across
the nation that are to receive loans.
</P>
<P>
   Those projects are a nine-mile toll road to be built between San
Diego and the Mexican border, which is to receive $127 million in
loans; road improvements and a ``people mover'' system at Miami
International Airport, which is to receive $436 million in loans; a
rapid transit system under construction in San Juan, P.R., which is
to receive $300 million in loans, and the Metrorail system in
Washington, which is to receive a $600 million loan guarantee for
improvements.

MOST HEAT IN EL CHEAPO MOLE COMES FROM THE STOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a notation on the cover of the menu at the Guadalupe
Cafe in Sante Fe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chilies are Hot! Chilies are Hot! Chilies are Hot!
</P>
<P>
   ``Not responsible for complaints that chilies are too hot.''
</P>
<P>
   I ordered the breakfast enchilada, which consisted of blue corn
tortillas baked under layers of pinto beans, fried potatoes, green
chili, green chili sauce and lots of cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? It was pretty hot. Alice the Artist remarked that my
face was suddenly as red as the tail light on a baboon.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I'm complaining, mind you.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, green chilies come in two versions _ mild and hot.
In New Mexico there are three versions _ hot, hotter and fried
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   It is the habanero chili that fries the tongue and melts the
silverware. According to Santa Fe locals, the only antidote for the
habanero is a mouthful of fried-bread sopaipillas, loaded with
honey.
</P>
<P>
   Some natives claim New Mexico restaurants are rated on the
excellence of their sopaipillas. Others claim that green chili is
the state's signature dish. To trap the unwary, the word chili can
refer to an ingredient, a sauce or a stew often containing beans,
potatoes and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't want to go to all the bother of deep-frying a
batch of sopaipillas, New Mexico natives can opt for a stack of
tortillas from Leona's Restaurante de Chimayo to go with their
chili stew.
</P>
<P>
   Leona prepares traditional tortillas, but she also offers red
chili, jalapeno and pinon nut tortillas. Or customers can opt for
onion, garlic or pesto tortillas. Then, if they are looking ahead
to dessert, they will find tortillas prepared in strawberry,
raspberry, blueberry, apple cinnamon, chocolate and banana flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Leona's open-air establishment is next to an ancient church in
the small community of Chimayo. The church was built in 1816
without the use of nails. To the left of the altar is El Pozito, a
small well revered for its ``healing dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   You can order tortillas, biscochitos, dry mixes for green chili
stew plus sopaipillas and a video on the healing-dirt shrine. All
you have to do is send an e-mail to Leonas(at)Roadrunner.com via
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure healing dirt is an antidote for fried tongue, so
for dinner tonight you might want to cook up less incendiary
Southwest concoctions like:
</P>
<P>
   El Cheapo Mole
</P>
<P>
   7 large turkey drumsticks
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped onions
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1 chicken bouillon cube
</P>
<P>
   2 flour tortillas, torn in pieces
</P>
<P>
   2 1-ounce squares unsweetened chocolate
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons slivered almonds
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup peanuts
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chili powder
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons plus one-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have pumpkin seeds, you can substitute pine nuts or
shelled sunflower seeds. If you don't have tortillas on hand
substitute one slice of wheat bread.
</P>
<P>
   OK, dump the drumsticks into a large pot, cover with water and
add 2 tablespoons of salt. Bring the water to a boil, reduce heat
and simmer the drumsticks for an hour, or until the meat is tender.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the drumsticks from the water and let cool. No, no, don't
pour out the water. Save 2 cups of it, adding 1 chicken bouillon
cube. Use your hands to separate the meat from the skin and bones.
Refrigerate the turkey meat, covered, until needed.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before you plan to eat, saute the onions and garlic in
the canola oil until they soften. Plunk the pan contents into a
blender, add { cup of the poultry broth and lean on the button for
1 minute. Pour the resultant sludge into a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Into the blender bowl pour another one-half cup of broth. Add
the tortillas, chocolate, nuts and seeds. Blend, then add to the
bowl with the onion muck.
</P>
<P>
   Once again into the blender jar add one-half cup of poultry
broth, plus the chili powder, sugar, cumin, { teaspoon salt and
cinnamon. Blend until smooth then pour into the bowl with the other
blended ingredients. Taste to see if the sauce needs more sugar.
</P>
<P>
   The sauce should be fairly thick but pourable. Add a bit more
broth if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Plunk the turkey meat into an oven casserole, top with the mole
sauce, then shove into a 350-degree oven for 30 minutes, or until
bubbling. Serves six or more.
</P>
<P>
   Corn and Chili Custard
</P>
<P>
   1 cup creamed corn
</P>
<P>
   1 cup grated sharp Cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cooked rice
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup milk
</P>
<P>
   14 black medium olives, sliced
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons chopped green onions
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons pickled jalapenos, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs, beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   Tabasco sauce to taste
</P>
<P>
   Grease oven dish. Combine all ingredients together, dump into
the dish and shove into a preheated, 350-degree oven for 30
minutes. Serves four to six as a side dish.
</P>
<P>
   For dessert, spread chocolate mousse on one of Leona's chocolate
tortillas, rolled up burrito style and topped with a
chocolate-dipped strawberry secured with a toothpick.
</P>
<P>
   That should hold you over until tomorrow morning's Sante Fe
breakfast enchilada, when you should remember one thing:
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, chilies are hot!

LEADING CONTENDER FOR TOP EDITOR AT MIAMI HERALD  
 NEW MAGAZINE TO CHALLENGE LOS ANGELES  
 ABC PLANS SPEEDY ENCORE FOR NEW DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Texas)  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
(lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The four-month search for a new executive editor at The Miami
Herald is almost over, and Robert Rivard, editor and senior vice
president of The San Antonio Express News, is the leading candidate
for the job, according to one Knight Ridder executive, who asked
not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The Herald's publisher, Alberto Ibarguen, said on Friday that
other candidates were still under consideration. ``I guarantee you
there's no done deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rivard has met with Jerry Ceppos, Knight Ridder's vice president
for news, Knight Ridder executives confirmed. And the San Antonio
editor, who won prizes for his coverage of Nicaragua's Sandinistas
in the early 1980s and later served five years as Newsweek's chief
of correspondents, has discussed the job with friends and
colleagues. And Ibarguen said on Friday, ``I intend to wrap this up
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Polk Laffoon IV, the spokesman for Knight Ridder, which owns The
Herald, said late on Friday, ``No job offer has been made.''
Rivard, he said, ``is a leading candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are other candidates,'' Laffoon said. ``It is not
over.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible in-house candidate is the managing editor, Larry
Olmstead; another is Mark Seibel, the assistant managing editor for
metropolitan news. Ceppos saw both men at work during visits to
Miami in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   If Rivard, who is 46, gets the job, he will leave Hearst
newspapers after almost a decade editing in South Texas. He left
Newsweek in 1989 to join The San Antonio Light. When Hearst folded
that paper in 1993, he found a berth as assistant managing editor
at Hearst's Express News. He took over the top job two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Dickey, Newsweek's Paris bureau chief, said on
Friday: ``The first thing that would help him is that he's
bilingual. And he's ambitious in the best sense of the word _ to
run a great newspaper and win prizes.''
</P>
<P>
   A journalist at The Express News, who declined to be identified,
said that Rivard, who broke into the business as a sports reporter
at The Brownsville Herald in South Texas, ``is bright, intelligent,
quick on his feet and very complex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have strong feelings about him, favorably or
unfavorably,'' the journalist said.
</P>
<P>
   At The Herald, Rivard would inherit a newsroom bolstered by a
1999 Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting but bruised by
repeated defections of accomplished journalists and persistent
circulation declines.
</P>
<P>
   _ FELICITY BARRINGER
</P>
<P>
   New Magazine to Challenge Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   Ask magazine insiders why Los Angeles cannot support more than
one city glossy, and they will offer a handful of theories: The
city is too disparate demographically; the upstarts are of poor
quality; Angelenos don't read.
</P>
<P>
   In 37 years, only one city magazine here, Los Angeles, has
survived. Next month, another challenger, Channel Los Angeles, will
be spun off from Channel Miami, owned by a former stockbroker,
Richard Bronson. It will be mailed to high-income households and
given away at trendy boutiques, with the hope of eventually drawing
paying subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   To distinguish itself, Channel is taking an approach that makes
the soft-focus Los Angeles seem hard-boiled. The first issue,
scheduled for Oct. 13, is heavy on celebrity sightings, with
profiles of the actress Angela Bassett and Randy Gerber, a
nightclub proprietor, and an article on the fashion accessories of
celebrities' dogs
</P>

   ``What Channel magazine won't be doing is nasty expose
stories,'' said Sue Cameron, the magazine's executive editor. What
there will be, she said, is a plastic-surgery column written by the
former New York madam Sidney Biddle Barrows.

<P>
   The economics of the industry require a delicate balance. The
key is reaching the most affluent readers in the city to draw
advertisers, though that market ends up being minuscule _ many
place it at around 200,000 readers. Los Angeles already has 183,000
of those readers, said its publisher, Liz Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the magazine business give the newcomer little chance.
``I don't think the world needs another celebrity-oriented
magazine,'' said Allan Mayer, former editor of Buzz.

<P>
   But Ms. Cameron said, ``I think Los Angeles is a city that can
support more than one magazine.''

   ABC Plans Speedy Encore for New Drama
</P>
<P>
   The ABC drama series ``Once and Again'' is both the network's
best-reviewed new show and part of its most-scrutinized new
business deal.
</P>
<P>
   The series, about a romance between two divorced parents, will
be shown on ABC on Tuesdays and on Lifetime on Fridays, thanks to
ABC's decision to sell reruns of the show to the cable network, of
which ABC's parent, Walt Disney Co., owns a 50 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   The move is the latest sign of the new strategy that is driving
the networks and the companies that own them: developing multiple
distribution outlets for programs they own, in an effort to
maximize revenue for ever more costly programming.
</P>
<P>
   The main difference in this deal is the short time frame between
a network play and a cable play. NBC already had a deal in place
with USA Networks for its new series ``Law and Order: Special
Victims Unit.'' That will enable the USA cable network to present
episodes of that new drama, but no sooner than 13 days after they
appear on NBC. The first episode played on NBC last Monday; it will
appear on USA on Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ABC agreed to the shorter window, a senior network executive
said, because Lifetime was simply willing to pay more money and
because Lifetime was considered a sister network. NBC actually
agreed to the USA deal somewhat reluctantly because it was
renegotiating a rights fee for ``Law and Order,'' the hit series
that spawned ``Special Victims Unit.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC, on the other hand, acknowledges that the network, as well
as the creators of ``Once and Again,'' Ed Zwick and Marshal
Herskovitz, eagerly agreed to Lifetime's offer. They say they view
the double play within the same week as an experiment in how a show
is affected by having a second run on a cable channel soon after
its network run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it may actually help the show,'' a senior ABC
executive said. The executive spoke on condition of anonymity out
of deference to ABC's affiliated stations, who were adamantly
opposed to losing their exclusive rights to broadcast ABC programs.
But in some tough negotiations this summer, ABC won from its
affiliates the right to replay up to 25 percent of its prime-time
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' happened to be an ideal program for Lifetime
because of its appeal to female viewers. But it is also certain not
to be the last show ABC finds a second use for in this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we'll do it again, if this works,'' the ABC executive
said.

LUCK OF THE AMERICANS SHINES AT THE 17TH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The sobs just rolled and rolled from deep in
Ben Crenshaw's chest. His wife, Julie, was hugging the United
States captain as firmly as any wife could hug a husband, but the
sobs just kept bursting out. From deep inside Ben Crenshaw, from
the very depths of his soul.
</P>
<P>
   Pandemonium was swarming around that 17th green. Spain's Sergio
Garcia was milling from here to there, tears streaming down his
cheeks, the 19-year-old crying openly, but his tears were so
different from Crenshaw's. Crushing tears from the boy, while
Crenshaw's were those of a defining moment of life.
</P>
<P>
   When that 50-foot putt of Justin Leonard dropped into the cup _
dropping so unexpectedly _ Bruce Lietzke raised both arms high and
jumped up and down like a pogo-stick man, first shouting, ``It's
history . . . it's history,'' and then the assistant US captain
kept repeating as loud as his lungs would allow, ``It's the
pairings! Ben, it was the pairings! It was the pairings.''
</P>
<P>
   Down near the front bunker, US golfer Tom Lehman grabbed Leonard
in a bear hug and would not let the day's hero down for at least a
full 10 seconds. Other members of the US team rushed Leonard, as
did their wives and girlfriends, and Leonard was nearly toppled
into the bunker in the Americans' joy and ecstasy. This scene, once
the Europeans cleared their tears and angst, would be seen as an
International Golf Incident.
</P>
<P>
   But not then. Soon the green was cleared, and eventually Jose
Maria Olazabal _ after one last step-back from the putt for a final
read _ would send his 20-footer up the bank on the 17th green and
watch it roll by on the low side. Ben Crenshaw toppled over at the
sight and kissed the ground of The Country Club three times.
</P>
<P>
   The sobs could not be stopped for many a breath but when
Crenshaw finally was able to speak only bits and pieces of thought
could be expressed. ``Lanny . . . Where's Lanny?'' were the first
words from Crenshaw's mouth, the Captain's tribute to Lanny
Wadkins, the 1995 captain whose US team had fallen apart in the
singles matches on Sunday and lost to the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Next from the captain's mouth came bits and pieces that only the
US captain could utter. ``Ouimet's horseshoe . . . '' and
``Ouimet's horseshoe is absolutely there.''
</P>
<P>
   And those were words that only a handful in that wild stampede
of thousands of delirious fans on the 17th green could grasp. But
Crenshaw knew exactly, knew precisely that the 17th hole of The
Country Club is where all important golf matches have been decided.
The luck of the Americans is buried there, somewhere, on that 17th
hole. Always US luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Ouimet's horseshoe did it,'' said Crenshaw again, and
Crenshaw has studied that picture of Francis Ouimet, the Brookline
caddie who upset Harry Vardon, Britain's best and the world's best,
to win the 1913 US Open at The Country Club. Crenshaw knew exactly
that Ouimet had made 20-footers on both the 17th hole in regulation
to tie the match and the 17th hole in the playoff to win it. ``It's
spooky,'' Crenshaw would say later.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment Sunday when US golf was rescued by Justin
Leonard, Crenshaw's mind flashed back to that picture of Ouimet
carried back to the clubhouse on the shoulders of adoring fans
after his upset in 1913. And in Ouimet's hand was a horseshoe. And,
Crenshaw would say, ``Ouimet's house (was) right across that
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on that 17th green were Olazabal and Brendan McCartain, his
caddie. Just moments earlier, when Olazabal was in the backswing of
his approach shot, a fan in the gallery had simulated a loud yawn.
Olazabal angrily looked back at the fan and McCartain shouted over
to the gallery, ``If you need to win the Ryder Cup that bad, then
you can have it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes earlier, on that same 17th green, there had been a
mini-stampede. At that moment, it was felt by one and possibly all
that the match of between Mark O'Meara and Europe's Padraig
Harrington would decide the Ryder Cup. The match was all square and
gamesmanship was paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, for instance, forced an impatient O'Meara to wait a
full five minutes or more as the Irishman walked all the way to the
green to inspect the pin placement and slowly ambled back to his
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that didn't really bother me,'' O'Meara would say later,
when all damage had been erased by Leonard's putt. ``It didn't
affect my shot.''
</P>
<P>
   But it certainly seemed it did because O'Meara fluffed his
second shot horribly, the ball traveling little more than halfway
to the green. But O'Meara was able to apparently save a halve when
he buried a snaky downhill 6-footer and the Americans erupted in
glee; Tom Lehman rushed onto the green in joy and Tiger Woods, Hal
Sutton, Davis Love, and the others jumped for joy.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, though, still had a putt to take.
</P>
<P>
   The Irishman gave a dark glance toward Lehman and the happy
Americans but, he, too, would say later that he hadn't been upset.
``I didn't even see Lehman,'' said Harrington, ``and then they
conceded the putt.'' Indeed, it was O'Meara who saw a mini-incident
in the making and shouted over to Harrington that his putt was
good; O'Meara would have made Harrington make the crucial putt if
it hadn't been for the US jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   Few scenes in Boston sports history have been as spontaneously
wild as those on 17. And if Ben Crenshaw felt that it was fate that
would cause that stampede on the 17th because the 17th ``has been
very, very kind to Americans,'' the result was a most tasty win for
the United States.

ONCE PETTITTE IS LOOSE, THE YANKEES FALL APART 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With his fastball going where he wanted it and his
sinker falling low, Andy Pettitte felt good warming up Sunday. But
once the game began, Pettitte lost his command, and a brutal day
for the Yankees' pitchers began to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte, who was ripped for a double by Miguel Cairo on the
second pitch of the game, struggled through six innings, and Ramiro
Mendoza, the losing pitcher, was even worse. The two Yankee
pitchers allowed 15 hits in a 6-5 loss to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
in front of 49,458 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees stroked 11 hits off the equally unimpressive Devil
Rays pitchers as the game took on the feel of a doubleheader,
lasting exactly four hours.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the Yankees' second straight to Tampa Bay, which
they defeated 17 times in their first 18 meetings, including nine
straight in the Bronx. But their magic number for clinching the
American League East division title was reduced to three when the
Red Sox lost to the Orioles. Cleveland, which won, has the league's
best record at 95-61. The Yankees are 94-61.
</P>
<P>
   After surrendering the game-opening double to Cairo, Pettitte
retired the next three batters on ground balls. But he gave up four
runs and nine hits over the next five innings, including five of
the Devil Rays' franchise-record seven doubles and a home run. Two
of those doubles and the homer were delivered by Bubba Trammell,
who got his hits in the second, fourth and sixth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre said Pettitte pitched OK and
uncharacteristically mentioned that the umpire Travis
Katzenmeirer's strike zone might have been a factor. Katzenmeirer
started the game behind second base, but when the home plate
umpire, Jim Joyce, suffered a bruised cornea in the first inning
after catching mud in his eye, Katzenmeirer began calling the balls
and strikes in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmeirer, a minor-league umpire, fills in for vacationing or
injured major-league umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pettitte couldn't get enough balls down, and that strike zone
kept moving all around,'' Torre said. ``Sometimes they were strikes
and sometimes they weren't, and I think he couldn't figure how to
lock in. I haven't seen that umpire before and I haven't seen that
strike zone before either.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he ever figured out where to throw the ball,
Pettitte, who allowed 10 or more hits for just the third time in
his 30 starts this season, said that he had not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good starting the game out,'' said Pettitte, who said
the five-minute delay after Joyce's injury might have thrown him
off his rhythm. ``But I wasn't able to locate like I wanted to. I
didn't think I was going to get through the second inning, to tell
you the truth. But I was able to scramble through six somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Pettitte's problems, the Yankees had a chance to win
when Derek Jeter broke a 4-4 tie with an awkward sixth-inning
double. Jeter's bloop hit took a strange bounce into the stands
along the right-field line and scored Chad Curtis, who had walked
and stolen second base, and gave Jeter his 100th RBI of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, who had never had more than 84 RBIs in his three previous
seasons, joined Lyn Lary, who drove in 107 runs in 1931, as the
only shortstops in Yankees history to record at least 100 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was on me for staying on 99 for a while,'' said
Jeter, who had not driven in a run since Sept. 19, a stretch of
five games. ``I was wondering if I was going to get it. But my
teammates were getting on base a lot, so I figured one time I'd get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza started the seventh and gave up a walk and one hit, but
he stranded the two base runners by striking out Trammell with a
diving fastball outside.
</P>
<P>
   But Mendoza was not as fortunate in the eighth, when his
belt-high pitches resulted in four hits, two runs and a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inconsistent,'' Torre said in summing up Mendoza's
performance. ``If he keeps the ball down, he's very tough to dig
out of the dirt. When he elevates the ball, he's a lot easier to
hit.''

SPORTS COLUMN: U.S. WINS WITH CHARGE FROM BEYOND THE FRINGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Justin Leonard's putt crawled up, up and
across the ledge on the 17th green and dived into the hole like a
field mouse.
</P>
<P>
   As Leonard struggled during the week, Ben Crenshaw, the American
captain, kept promising that ``Justin's going to make a putt.'' And
he already had, a 30-footer on the 15th green Sunday that squared
his match with Jose Maria Olazabal after having been 4 down. But
now the little Texan had made a 45-footer for a birdie 3 that will
be remembered as the most theatrical putt in Ryder Cup history.
</P>
<P>
   In their elation, several American players and their wives
rushed to celebrate with Leonard, but soon they remembered that
Olazabal still had to putt for what might be a tying birdie. So did
Crenshaw, now crouched behind the green, saying, ``All right.''
Next to him, Bruce Edwards, Tom Watson's longtime caddie, who was
here as an assistant to Crenshaw, turned to the captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he misses, you win,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God,'' Crenshaw said quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're five seconds away,'' Edwards said, ``from the greatest
comeback in the history of the Ryder Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   But it would be more like five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal, the Spaniard who had played so well for the European
team in other cup matches, knew he had to make his 25-footer. He
studied the uphill line, walked around and peered at the contours
near the cup, finally took his stance over the ball, then stepped
back, studied the line again, took his stance again and putted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please miss.'' Edwards whispered what all the Americans were
wishing. ``Please miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal's ball moved up the slope and across the ledge, but
when it stayed left of the hole, the American players rushed
Leonard. But Crenshaw, who seemed to have been holding his breath
all that time, moved forward, knelt and kissed the green, then
joined the celebration as Olazabal shook hands with the American
captain.
</P>
<P>
   With Leonard 1 up going to the 18th hole, the U.S. Ryder Cup
team was assured of the half-point it needed for an unprecedented
4-point comeback in the 12 singles matches for a 14{-13{ triumph at
The Country Club that had both proper and improper Bostonians
roaring as if the Red Sox had won a World Series.
</P>
<P>
   And for Ben Crenshaw, his crusade had been a success.
</P>
<P>
   It hadn't been easy. In the August controversy over some
American golfers' request for money they could donate to their
individual charities, he had questioned the commitment of Tiger
Woods, David Duval, Phil Mickelson and Mark O'Meara. Critics had
second-guessed his two wild-card choices, Tom Lehman and Steve
Pate, as well as some of his Friday and Saturday pairings.
</P>
<P>
   And going into Sunday's singles, most observers thought his team
had no chance. But he emerged as a captain to remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told them all week,'' he said, ``that I've been admirers
of their talent, their spirit, their will, their unshakable
belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever the sentimentalist, Crenshaw remembered that when he played
here at age 16 in the U.S. Junior championship, his father had
followed his matches. And he mentioned that Mrs. Harvey Penick, the
widow of his golf tutor in Austin, Texas, was here for these
matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how these things happen,'' he said. ``I do know
how it happened, though. By these fellows and the way they can play
golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal and the European captain, Mark James, complained about
the outburst of emotion by the American players and their wives on
the 17th green, but Olazabal declined to ``find an excuse'' in it,
saying it had no effect on the result. And ever the golf gentleman,
Crenshaw later ``sincerely'' apologized to the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   But this was more than just another miracle team comeback. This
was sports theater at its finest with a patriotic backdrop, up
there with the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team stunning the Soviet
Union and then winning the gold medal at Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the alternate-shot and better-ball matches on Friday
and Saturday, the galleries had chanted ``U.S.A.! U.S.A.!'' as the
Europeans grabbed a 10-6 lead. But Sunday Crenshaw wisely sent out
his six best players in the first six singles in order to blunt the
Europeans' opportunity for 4 quick, clinching points.
</P>
<P>
   And those six _ Lehman, Hal Sutton, Mickelson, Davis Love III,
Woods and Duval _ quickly created a 12-10 turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a force that was pulling us together,'' Crenshaw
said later, ``and it was building.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Europeans had taken an imposing 6-2 lead Friday,
Sutton said, ``We've got to dig deep in our souls now.'' He
certainly did, contributing 3 points, 2 in alternate-shot matches
and 1 in Sunday's singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a horse,'' Crenshaw said. ``He hit some great golf shots,
time after time. We drew strength from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago Duval, the world's No. 2-ranked player in his first
Ryder Cup, had described these matches as a ``big corporate
outing'' and an exhibition, but in his 5-and-4 rout of Jesper
Parnevik, the Swede who had played so well the first two days, he
reacted as if he were golf's Nathan Hale, with only one match to
give for his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you can't explain and can't appreciate until
you've been a part of it,'' Duval said later. ``The great analogy
is that it's like when you have your first child.''
</P>
<P>
   In the controversy over payments to be donated to charity, Woods
had described the Ryder Cup as an ``exhibition, because there's no
winner's check.'' All each player received was a $5,000 stipend.
But he didn't act as if Sunday's singles was an exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben did a great job of getting us together and keeping us
together,'' Woods said later. ``We did it for him.''
</P>
<P>
   And with Steve Pate and Jim Furyk comfortably ahead in matches
they would win, the Americans knew they still needed another
half-point to win. O'Meara had a chance for it at the 18th hole,
but he drove his tee shot into a bunker, hit his approach into a
greenside bunker, then fluffed his sand shot into the rough. Bogey.
No half-point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough situation,'' O'Meara later said, ``when you know
you're not playing your best.''
</P>
<P>
   But by then, Leonard had evened his match and when he made that
putt on the 17th and Olazabal missed his putt, Ben Crenshaw, ever
the historian, kissed the same green where America's first golf
idol, the 20-year-old amateur Francis Ouimet, had made important
putts both in the fourth round and the 18-hole playoff of the 1913
U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a little spooky,'' Crenshaw would say later. ``And
his house was right across the street.''

in East Timor. Outsiders are incredulous to discover the feisty
82-year-old nun alive after she was widely reported to have been
slaughtered in the territory's post-election terror.
</P>
<P>
   She was, she jokes, miraculously resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Margarita is one of at least a dozen high-profile East
Timorese _ Roman Catholic clergy, independence leaders, aid
workers, even the father of resistance leader Xanana Gusmao _ who
have turned up days and weeks after being reported dead at the
hands of rampaging Indonesian soldiers and militia.
</P>
<P>
   They tell stories of hiding in the mountains, in a convent, or,
in Sister Margarita's case, in plain sight. Just one hour after she
was flushed out in an Indonesian attack Sept. 6 on the home of
Bishop Carlos Belo, the Nobel Peace laureate and East Timorese
independence sympathizer, Sister Margarita went back to the
complex, and has remained there.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected and welcome news contrasts with three weeks of
horrifying reports of massacres of thousands of people, forced
relocation of hundreds of thousands, and scores of targeted
killings in refugee camps _ accounts that catalyzed international
opinion behind deploying peacekeepers. But it also suggests that
piecing together what happened this month will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Independence activists and the official Indonesian news agency
reported that as many as 30 people were killed in Belo's compound,
but it turned out that only one was. The Catholic aid agency
Caritas International had said most of its staff of 32 people had
been slain, but at least 17 were accounted for alive as of Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous priests were reputedly slaughtered, but just four are
now confirmed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone in or around Dili says they know someone who was
killed or who disappeared, yet only one major massacre _ more than
100 people slain in a church in the western town of Suai _ is
believed confirmed so far.
</P>
<P>
   There are growing signs that reports of massacres may have been
inaccurate, and the estimates by a UN agency and observer groups of
7,000 or more slain may have been high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are all the mass graves?'' asked Brigadier David
Richards, who commands the British contingent of peacekeepers.
``When I was in Sierra Leone in January there were bodies all over
the place in graves newly dug.''
</P>
<P>
   After grimly surveying two charred skeletons and noting their
identities, Captain Alan Roan of the Gurkha Rifles said that
compared with Bosnia, things seem to be ``not to the same extent
here _ not yet. There'd be whole houses filled of bodies in
Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about where all the missing people were, Roan said it
seemed the perpetrators were ``more cunning here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampering the search is a lack of access to the Indonesian
stronghold on the western part of Timor, where massacres of
independence supporters are considered most likely to have
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   There are indisputable reports of people being taken against
their will en masse to West Timor and from there to other parts of
Indonesia, even as recently as three days ago. Amnesty
International said 35 men were thrown off a boat fleeing Dili on
Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   One place to start gathering evidence is in the Dili suburb of
Becora, where a reporter found three separate gravesites on
Saturday, and residents said there were more. In just one day, a
reporter who drove through the city in search of evidence of those
victims was led by residents to the remains of seven recent corpses
in six different locations.
</P>
<P>
   For professional war crimes investigators, verifying such
atrocities and mass killings is likely to be fraught with
conflicting and confusing evidence.
</P>
<P>
   A 2-day-old grave on a college campus contains either the
disemboweled corpse of a man found hanging from a pole with his
throat slit, or the waist-down half-corpse of a man who was killed
and eaten by animals, according to differing accounts from men who
said they buried the unknown victim.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of hundred yards away, at the economics building,
bloodstains marked the curbstones next to a shallow grave that
neighbors said they dug three days ago for an unidentified old man.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto da Silva, a 29-year-old farmer who was hiding in the
hills above Dili until the multinational force arrived, said that
he felt so angry when he found the unknown victim that if he knew
the killers he would kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Da Silva, who wears a plastic rosary around his neck,
acknowledges that Catholicism preaches forgiveness, not murder and
revenge. ``Yes, I'm a Catholic,'' he said ``but if you do it to me,
I have to do it to you.''
</P>
<P>
   His attitude suggests that UN officials should quickly
investigate the bloody revenge campaign that followed the vote for
independence and initiate a justice system _ before fed-up
vigilantes take matters into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in three days, angry mobs have grabbed suspected
militiamen and started to beat them before international
peacekeepers could intervene to arrest the suspects and calm the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   In at least two other instances, crowds turned over suspects to
the Australian-led peacekeepers without hurting them.
</P>
<P>
   Gaspar Arauju Da Costa, a 17-year-old student who had fled to
the hills with his uncle, found his pro-independence father
murdered in the secondary school adjacent to their backyard when
they returned a few days ago. He is still angry at the killers, he
said quietly, but believed in ``court justice. Put them in jail,
don't kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, Paul Da Costa, 53, was supposed to flee to the
mountains with Gaspar and his own brother, but he wanted to wait
for his daughter. The militias found them first, said a female
neighbor, and Gaspar's mother, three sisters, and younger brother
all were seized and taken against their will to Kupang, in the
undisputed Indonesian western half of Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Da Costa's body is now in a pit behind the secondary school,
covered with banana leaves and waiting for proper burial in his
hometown in the hills when the situation is safe enough to
transport it, his son said.
</P>
<P>
   A black square of cloth pinned to his shirt to indicate
mourning, Gaspar looked as though he was about to cry and could not
answer when asked if independence was worth the high price of a
murdered father and missing family.
</P>
<P>
   Across town in the Balide neighborhood, a burned-out house
painted with murals of Jesus and Mary hide the charred skeletons of
two men who were allegedly shot to death and then set on fire by
militias and men in military uniforms on Sept. 7. The fumes of
burned flesh still hang heavy in the air. Neighbors have left pink
bougainvilleae.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked for young people, but there were no young people
left here,'' said Rafael Joaquin Galuso, 21, whose uncle, Geronimo
Galuso, 40, was one of the victims. ``So they killed the old
people,'' he said.

ROOKIES HAVE HIGH HOPES
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ After the season, Jeff Williams is headed to the
Arizona Fall League, Alex Cora to Puerto Rico and Robinson Checo to
the Dominican Republic. The Dodgers hope their experiences this
winter will make them regular contributors to the club next year.
</P>
<P>
   Williams made his second start for the Dodgers on Sunday and
pitched impressively until the sixth when he allowed a game-tying
home run to Reggie Sanders. The Dodgers wound up winning 10-7 and
Williams certainly has gotten people's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of returning to his native Australia, Williams will
continue to start in Arizona and the club hopes he will compete for
the desperately needed left-handed spot in next year's rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These past few weeks have been exciting,'' said Williams, who
is expected to make another start Friday in Houston. ``I mean, you
work your whole life to get here. When you step on that mound, it
is something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Before allowing one run in seven innings Tuesday against the
Giants, Williams pitched in the bullpen for three weeks. Even
though he gave up four runs (three earned) in 52/3 innings Sunday,
pitching coach Claude Osteen thought Williams had better command
and location than his first start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still trying to find his way,'' Osteen said. ``Sanders
hit a sinker that stayed up. Jeff will learn to get guys out with
that pitch. I know he can throw harder than he has here. He's
around 88 mph now, but I had him last year at (Triple-A)
Albuquerque and he threw 93 consistently in one game. But for now,
it's better to hit your spots and gain confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Cora played shortstop in the ninth inning and made two
spectacular defensive plays. But it is unlikely he will get a
chance to unseat Mark Grudzielanek, who is batting .320. Cora, who
missed half the minor-league season with a broken right hand, has
appeared in 10 games since his recall. Most were at second base,
but he has not been told to work out there during the winter league
in his native Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little harder position because I've been at short all
season,'' said the left-handed hitting Cora, who batted second at
Triple-A Albuquerque and hit .310. ``Shortstop is easier because
you are looking at the first baseman when you throw. I've just
gotten used to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Checo will head back to the Dominican League, but there is a
good chance he will not pitch because of lingering discomfort in
his right groin that forced him to miss 40 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing for me is to come back healthy,''
Checo said. ``By spring training, I'm going to be 100 percent. I
want to compete for a starting spot.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Last hurrah: The Dodgers are off today before opening a
three-game series Tuesday against the Giants in the finale for
Candlestick Park. After Thursday's final game, the Giants will host
a two-hour ceremony that will include an appearance by former
Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda. It is being called ``one last chance
to boo Tommy,'' who coached and managed during many memorable
moments the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   __ Matchups for the series: Tuesday (7:15 p.m. _ Fox Sports West
2) Ismael Valdes (9-14, 3.98) vs. right-hander Joe Nathan (7-3,
3.76). . . . Wednesday (7:05 p.m. _ Fox Sports West 2) Kevin Brown
(18-8, 2.29) vs. right-hander Livan Hernandez (7-12, 4.77). . . .
Thursday (1:05 p.m. KTLA/5) Chan Ho Park (12-10, 5.51) vs.

QUAYLE PLANS TO DROP OUT OF 2000 RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Vice President Dan Quayle plans to announce
Monday that he is quitting the race for the Republican presidential
nomination, becoming the fourth White House prospect to leave a GOP
race dominated by the financial and political strength of George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle met with his wife, Marilyn, and senior aides over the
weekend and concluded that he did not have the money to compete
under next year's extraordinarily compressed primary schedule,
according to a senior aide who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He concluded the resources were not there to compete in the 18
or so contests in the 30 days following the New Hampshire
primary,'' the aide said Sunday night. The official said that while
Quayle believed he could have won in the Granite State, he was not
likely to have the money to compete with Bush after that.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is not expected to endorse a candidate at his news
conference Monday, the aide said. Quayle's withdrawal once again
focuses attention on Bush's strength; the Texas governor has
collected a stunning $55 million, draining much of the financial
oxygen out of the Republican contest.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle has been hobbled from the start of the race for several
reasons. Many analysts believe he has never been able to overcome
his introduction to the public in 1988, when the little-known
Indiana senator was selected as the vice presidential nominee by
George Bush. Fairly or not, he was portrayed as a wealthy man who
avoided combat duty by enlisting in the National Guard. He was
mocked for his misspelling of the word ``potato,'' a minor mistake
that came to symbolize questions about his intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Quayle was not nearly as wealthy as some believed, and
friends always insisted that he was more intelligent than many
realized. But there was no doubt that his timing was awkward this
year, competing against the son of former President Bush, his
former running mate. As a result, many ``Bushies,'' loyalists to
the Bush-Quayle administration, were put in the position of having
to pick between Quayle and George W. Bush. Bush won most of the
support and the vast majority of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's weakness was apparent at the Iowa straw poll in August,
when the former vice president came in eighth place. Quayle, who
had focused most of his attention on the first-caucus state,
insisted afterward that he would stay in the race through next
year, saying he would ``absolutely not'' quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I am the only one who can put the Reagan coalition
together, the social conservatives, economic conservatives,
national defense conservatives,'' Quayle said.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Globe survey in August found that Bush was leading in
New Hampshire among likely Republican voters with 44 percent.
Quayle received 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Given Quayle's weak financial support, he may have feared the
public reaction to a report he is required to file with the Federal
Election Commission. The third quarter financial reports are due on
Sept. 30. As of June 30, Quayle had raised slightly over $5
million, but his expenses were quickly devouring the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has legally avoided the cap on total contributions by
rejecting federal matching funds, has raised about $55 million so
far. Quayle believed Bush would raise $100 million by next year, a
staggering amount of money by the standards of any campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is the fourth candidate to leave the Republican race.
Previously this year, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio and
former Governor Lamar Alexander of Tennessee pulled out of the
Republican race, and Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire left the
GOP field to launch an independent bid.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick J. Buchanan, the former CNN commentator, is considering
leaving the GOP and running for the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Bush, the best-financed candidate is Steve Forbes,
who is tapping his personal fortune. The other remaining candidates
in the race include Elizabeth Dole, Senator John McCain of Arizona,
Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, former Reagan aide Gary Bauer and
talk show host Alan Keyes.

<P>
   In recent years, militaries have been pushed out of political
power in country after country. Now, some governments in Asia and
Latin America are rightly growing wary of the military's
entanglements with private business. In nations as varied as China,
Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Cuba and several Central American
countries, the armed forces have been among the most important
business owners. It is a combination that rarely serves a nation
well.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, this relationship has led to military
corruption, given the armed forces an independent economic base
that shields them from civilian control, and drawn them far from
their core mission of protecting national security. In some cases,
soldiers are proving no more eager to give up businesses than they
were to give up political control.
</P>
<P>
   In some nations, the military wields formidable economic power.
Until this year, the armed forces in China ran 15,000 companies,
including hotels and factories that had nothing to do with defense.
In Honduras, the military or its pension fund owns shrimp and palm
oil farms, part of a cement company, banks, insurance companies and
even a funeral parlor. A study by the Costa Rica-based Arias
Foundation called the pension fund one of the most important
financial powers in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   In many nations, especially Communist countries, governments
wanted large armies but did not want to pay for them. So they
allowed the militaries to go into business for themselves. Cuba's
military, for example, has long financed part of its operations
through factories producing military and industrial goods. As Cuba
has lost aid from overseas, moreover, the Communist Party has
expanded the military's role in business.
</P>
<P>
   In other countries, the militaries control businesses simply
because they were able to grab them. Decades of military rule in
Indonesia allowed the armed forces to buy up a multibillion-dollar
empire, often in cooperation with a member of the Suharto family.
Moreover, new civilian presidents who follow military rulers have
sometimes won the military's allegiance by allowing the armed
forces to keep, or even expand, their business holdings.
</P>
<P>
   China has made the most serious effort of any of these countries
to separate the military from commerce. Last year, President Jiang
Zemin ordered the military to cut its ties with its businesses, and
has since succeeded in transferring the ownership of most military
firms to other state companies. But it is unclear whether this has
produced a real change in who actually runs these business.
</P>
<P>
   A big obstacle to reform is that in many nations, the military's
business interests are a large part of its budget. If this revenue
disappeared, governments would have to underwrite the armed forces
or make politically difficult cuts. Another problem is that
military businesses provide post-retirement jobs and kickbacks for
powerful senior officers.
</P>
<P>
   But change is necessary. Governments might start by conducting
and publishing audits of military investments, which could increase
public pressure for change. In Honduras, there is finally hope that
a real audit of the pension fund will be conducted and published,
despite military resistance. No country can hope to have a
disciplined and professional military if the lure of corruption,
not love of country, motivates its soldiers.

Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. Because of his expertise
on the Soviet Union and its newly independent fragments, Talbott
has become the target of critics of President Clinton's policy of
financial and political engagement with Russia as revelations pour
forth of massive money-laundering schemes, the looting of
industries formerly controlled by the state and organized
corruption in and around the Kremlin. (Paul Hosefros/New York Times

tenor Placido Domingo hits a few high notes into the top balcony of
the Metropolitan Opera House and breaks an operatic record that has
stood longer than Babe Ruth's 60-homer season did. The Metropolitan
Opera opens its season Monday night with a popular double bill:
Mascagni's ``Cavalleria Rusticana'' and Leoncavallo's
``Pagliacci.'' And for the 18th time in his career Domingo will

and for most young people, Kellem says, the military is ``not even
in their vocabularies.'' Raising an all-volunteer military has
never been easy, but the difficulties with recruiting have been
mounting in recent years as the economy courses along and college
becomes an attainable goal for more young people than ever.

``Drowning,'' by Maria Irene Fornes at the Signature Theater. Ms.
Fornes' plays have the meticulous composition of still lifes, which
means at times they are strikingly balanced and at others opaque,
impassive. The dialogue can be so flat, so lacking in the perfume
of real conversation, that the play could have been grown in a
hothouse, under artificial light. (Sara Krulwich/New York Times

Robert W. Pittman, America Online's president, with Audrey Weil,
general manager of the Compuserve unit, at a map showing AOL
locations. In a conglomerate-driven world, investors expect big
companies to own more than one brand. When AOL acquired Compuserve
in 1997, it predicted the dawning of a multiple-brand era in the
Internet access market, a view that industry analysts doubted would
be fulfilled so soon. AOL says so far in its fiscal first quarter,
which will end on Thursday, the long-struggling Compuserve added
300,000 subscribers. (Marty Katz/New York Times Photo)

customers, but the bigger challenge is fulfilling orders. A worker
checks an invoice and begins preliminary sorting, top, and at an

order, which is then boxed and sent by conveyor to workers who
prepare it for shipping. (George Frey/New York Times Photo)

 TIBCO PROVIDES NET'S GUTS SO OTHERS GET GLORY
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TOM STEIN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ The Internet has given birth to a multitude of cool
companies that allow people to play games, buy groceries, hunt for
apartments and pay their bills online.
</P>
<P>
   Tibco Software Inc. of Palo Alto is not that kind of Internet
company. It is a behind-the-scenes player that makes the
unglamorous, yet critically important, software used by such
leading Web sites as Yahoo, Lycos and CBS SportsLine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide the plumbing that makes e-business possible,'' said
Tibco chief executive Vivek Ranadive. ``We take pride in that.
There are lots of companies doing really cool stuff on the
Internet, but we're not one of them. We do the hard, boring work.''
</P>
<P>
   Tibco makes what it calls ``event-driven, publish and
subscribe'' software. It's a mouthful, but basically the software
connects disparate computer systems, so that information can be
seamlessly transported from point A to point B.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, for example, uses Tibco to provide its users with
instant, up-to-the-second stock quotes. With the aid of Tibco's
software, Yahoo can pull real-time stock market data from a variety
of sources and distribute it to users whenever they request it.
``Every time someone looks at a Yahoo stock quote, we get a
penny,'' said Ranadive.
</P>
<P>
   CBS SportsLine, an Internet destination for sports fans, uses
Tibco to gather sports scores and breaking news from a host of
sources such as the Associated Press and Reuters. It then feeds the
data into its online scoreboards and news stories.
</P>
<P>
   Tibco also provides the backbone of SportsLine's multimedia
applications. Baseball fans, for instance, can watch simulated
versions of live ballgames over the Internet. Every time Sammy Sosa
hits a home run, viewers can see an animated version of the famous
slugger round the bases in real time. Tibco software goes out and
gathers pitch-by-pitch data that's typed in as it happens and
transports that information to the Web site to be transformed into
simulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tibco is a core piece of what we do,'' said Dan
Leichtenschlag, senior vice president of operations at CBS
SportsLine. He wouldn't reveal what his company paid for the
technology, but a typical Tibco sale is about $400,000 per
customer.
</P>
<P>
   Tibco CEO Ranadive, 41, is something of an online pioneer. He
first made his mark on Wall Street as a tech wunderkind in the
mid-1980s. At that time, it was not uncommon for traders to have 15
separate monitors on their desks, each overflowing with stock
prices, news stories and financial data.
</P>
<P>
   Ranadive, who had just formed a company called Teknekron,
devised a software system to consolidate all this information on a
solitary desktop computer and thus give traders a centralized view
of pertinent data.
</P>
<P>
   His system caught the attention of large investment firms like
Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers. Pretty soon, nearly every major
financial institution was using the technology.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Ranadive sold the company to Reuters for $125 million.
But he was unwilling to take the money and run. He was convinced
the technology had applications far beyond Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Ranadive formed Tibco and convinced Reuters to take a
majority stake in the new venture. A year later, Cisco acquired 10
percent of the business. All told, the investors pumped nearly $400
million into Tibco to enhance the core technology and tailor it to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Tse, an analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston, believes
Tibco is now well positioned to grab a big slice of the Internet
pie, especially as more and more companies look to build complex,
second-generation Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``After dealing with demanding customers on Wall Street, Tibco
has developed a robust technology architecture needed to handle
high traffic volume and heavy content distribution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sportsline's Leichtenschlag agrees that Tibco's technology is
ready for prime time. He said most Internet technologies are a
constant source of aggravation because they are new and untested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tibco is one of the very few products we use that is
commercially solid,'' he said. ``We've had no problems with bugs or
the technology breaking down like we've had with other Internet
products we use.''
</P>
<P>
   Tibco, which currently has about 300 customers, is growing at
break-neck speed. It posted third-quarter revenue of $24 million, a
121 percent increase over the year-earlier period. Yet the company
has yet to turn a profit. It racked up a third-quarter loss of $1.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   But as with most Internet companies, the flow of red ink has not
prevented Tibco from going public. In July, it offered 9.2 million
shares to the public, raising approximately $124 million from the
offering.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Tibco finished trading Friday (Sept. 24) at $29.88 per share
and had a market capitalization of about $1.75 billion. Ranadive
said the company should be profitable by the fourth quarter of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Ranadive has just published a book about his
adventures in Silicon Valley. Called ``The Power of Now,'' the book
aims to teach business managers and aspiring entrepreneurs how to
operate a company in the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Ranadive's advice may raise eyebrows. For instance, he
takes the contrarian viewpoint that it's better to hire prima
donnas than team players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people who just agree with everyone else,'' he
said. ``Old-style consensus is a bunch of BS. I want people who are
smart, and most smart people are prima donnas. That's a fact of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his management style, Ranadive believes in letting his
people roam free and take risks. ``In the past, most companies were
as rigid as a marching band,'' he said. ``We want more jazz music _
that means letting our people go out and do their own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tibco, it seems, is a company that marches to a different
drummer.

REV.   GRAHAM TELLS HARVARD AUDIENCE TO SEEK ANSWERS IN GOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HERMIONE MALONE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ After a battle with Parkinson's disease and a
dose of bad weather left him unable to speak at a scheduled service
last year, the Rev. Billy Graham was determined to preach at
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he returned to campus for the first time since 1982,
with a message that the answer for all of life's questions is in
the Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is so simple and plain, but changes a life so
dramatically,'' said Seppo Rapo, a Harvard Medical School graduate,
who attended the service with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for answers, and Jesus is the answer. That's
kind of exciting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, speaking to a standing-room assembly of students and
community members at Harvard's Memorial Church, spoke on the real
meaning of the Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to the Cross today and you'll find a life here and now that
you never knew existed, and you'll find a future life the moment
you no longer exist in this world,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-year-old minister also admonished young people to stop
searching for the meaning of life in material, often sinful things.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never really find an answer until they find it in God,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   During his sermon, Graham said that the Cross ``shows the depth
of our sin'' and that the love of God ``is the only way of
salvation'' to guarantee a future life.
</P>
<P>
   For many in attendance, it was the first time they had seen
Graham preach, and though the minister joked in his opening that he
hoped not to be an ``anticlimax,'' several students found him
inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know his health is not as good as it was, but he still has a
strong spirit,'' said Anna Katherine Coats, who was visiting from
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   One anecdote that stayed with many after the service was of a
little boy who was lost. A police officer happened upon him and
unsuccessfully tried to help the boy remember where he lived.
Finally, the officer looked up at the steeple of a church in the
town and pointed to the Cross. The boy, recognizing the symbol of
Christianity said to the officer, ``Take me to the Cross. I can
find my way home from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham will appear again Monday night at the Kennedy School of
Government.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It was incredible, emotional and historic,
the biggest comeback ever in golf's most compelling team
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup is once again American property, as the U.S. team
stormed back to win, 14{-13{, winning eight and splitting one of
Sunday's 12 singles matches _ in which scoring is determined by
winning holes instead of counting total strokes. No team had ever
overcome a four-point deficit on the final day; in fact, no team
had overcome a final-day deficit greater than two points.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 10-6 heading into Sunday's 12 singles matches, the U.S.
Ryder Cup team rose together as one, lifting one another, lifting
their games, lifting the pride of the thousands of Americans who
watched at The Country Club here and the many more who watched the
drama unfold on television.
</P>
<P>
   The cup-winning putt was made by Justin Leonard, who sank an
improbable 45-foot uphill birdie putt that became part of golf
history the instant it fell into the cup. Leonard held his putter
aloft and did a joyful dance as he ran off the 17th green, and he
was immediately mobbed to the left of the green by teammates, who
realized that their improbable dream had nearly become reality.
</P>
<P>
   When the green finally cleared, and when the ground finally
stopped shaking, Jose Maria Olazabal had a chance to keep Europe's
hopes alive. But his 25-foot birdie attempt slid just past the
hole, putting Leonard 1 up with one hole to play and assuring him
of at least the half-point that would clinch victory for the United
States. The Europeans, who seemed in command starting Sunday's
play, lost the Ryder Cup for the first time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For Leonard, the 1997 British Open champion, it was a day of
redemption, after he played inconsistently early in the
competition. Leonard was 4 down to Olazabal through 11 holes, but
he won the next four consecutive holes, making a 30-foot birdie
putt on No. 15, then making his unforgettable putt two holes later.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his putt on No. 17, Leonard said, ``I didn't know if
I could make it. I just believe it was one of those putts that was
destined to go in.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Europeans complimented the U.S for its victory, they
were also upset about the celebration on No. 17, because the cup
still had not been clinched, and Olazabal was still waiting to
putt. Olazabal was forced to wait several minutes before the
commotion subsided prior to attempting his putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of behavior is not what anyone expects to see,''
said Olazabal. ``It was an ugly picture. I understand there was a
lot of emotion, but you have to have both feet on the ground and
realize what the situation is. But the fact is, they played better
today, and they won.'
</P>
<P>
   U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw apologized for the outburst at No. 17,
as did his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened on No. 17 was unfortunate, but I'm not going to
apologize for being excited,'' said Tom Lehman, one of the
teammates who rushed to grab Leonard. ``It was a great day for the
American team.''
</P>
<P>
   When the competition ended, there was an outpouring of emotion
and champagne at The Country Club, in a festive scene that was the
climax of a fairy-tale day. American players cried tears of joy.
European players cried tears of sadness. Members of the American
team ran to the balcony of the clubhouse, spraying champagne on
each other, as adoring flag-waving fans watched from below chanting
``USA, USA.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Americans overcome a huge deficit, but they
overcame the tremendous play of an underrated European team, and
the heavy burden of being favored in a much-anticipated biennial
event. For two days, the Europeans played superb golf, making
spectacular shots that deflated the U.S. team, and it appeared the
Americans were on the verge of suffering another humbling loss.
</P>
<P>
   But at an inspiring team meeting Saturday night, Crenshaw and
every player talked about how much winning the Ryder Cup meant, how
they had not played up to their potential, and how they still
believed they would win.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw made a prophetic statement Saturday night, when he
proclaimed, ``I believe in fate. I have a good feeling about
this.'' Crenshaw helped deliver the motivation, and his team
delivered an impassioned performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only comments last night were that if we go down, let's go
down with all our oars in the water,'' said Hal Sutton, the best
player for America in the competition with 3{ points. ``Leaving
that meeting, we all felt we could go out and make a real run at
this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans seized control at the start Sunday and built
momentum. The American game plan was simple: to win the first four
matches, to even the competition (each match victory was worth 1
point and each halved match was worth 1/2 point) and to put
immediate pressure on their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans started even better than expected, sweeping
the first six matches in shocking fashion. Lehman defeated Lee
Westwood, 3 and 2. Sutton toppled Darren Clarke, 4 and 2. Phil
Mickelson beat Jarmo Sandelin, 4 and 3. Davis Love III dominated
Jean Van de Velde, 6 and 5. Tiger Woods defeated Andrew Coltart, 3
and 2. And David Duval dropped Jesper Parnevik, 5 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the U.S. team had a 10-8 lead, with the Europeans
still needing four points to clinch the tie they needed to retain
the Ryder Cup.

 BROOKLINE, Mass.: Ryder Cup.

<P>
   ``The momentum was definitely building,'' said Parnevik, who
played brilliantly Friday and Saturday, teaming with Sergio Garcia
to go 3-0-1 in foursome and four-ball competition. ``When they got
the first six matches easily, the crowd is going to get more
involved. They just got huge momentum going.''
</P>
<P>
   With each putt that fell, with each match that went in favor of
the United States, the crescendo of noise echoing through the trees
became louder. The Europeans heard every roar, and the pressure on
them became greater.
</P>
<P>
   There was nowhere to hide, nowhere to run. During the team
format Friday and Saturday, the Europeans played together
beautifully, but team captain Mark James gambled, asking his best
players to carry most of the load. Seven Europeans played five
matches in three days, while James benched Van de Velde, Coltart
and Sandelin until Sunday. Of the seven Europeans who played all
five matches _ Westwood, Clarke, Parnevik, Padraig Harrington,
Miguel Angel Jimenez, Colin Montgomerie and Garcia _ five of them
lost Sunday. The three players whom James benched until Sunday also
lost, but James disagreed that his strategy had backfired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were outplayed,'' he said. ``I don't think we were
outmaneuvered. They came out screeching. It was quite remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   After Steve Pate defeated Jimenez, 3 and 2, Jim Furyk delivered
another huge triumph for the United States by dominating Garcia, 4
and 3, before Leonard's match was over. That left the United States
only { point from victory, and Leonard's putter took care of the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the NBC golf analyst Johnny Miller felt that
Crenshaw should have played Jeff Maggert in the afternoon instead
of Leonard, who was struggling at the time. Crenshaw said he played
Leonard because of a hunch, but Miller said, ``I have a hunch
Justin Leonard should go home and watch it on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's victory, Leonard said, ``It's a good thing I
didn't go home.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was a good thing for the Americans that they never
stopped believing. They were in bad straits, being criticized for
trailing a team they were expected to beat, facing the prospect of
losing the Ryder Cup for the third consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they created one of the most memorable team comebacks
in sports, rallying to win an event that seems to grow in magnitude
as the years pass. When the Ryder Cup began in 1927, who could have
pictured a scene like Sunday's, with more then 30,000 people in the
gallery, from all over the world, their emotions swaying with each
shot? It is the most pressure-packed atmosphere in golf, and the
U.S. players met the challenge. When the next Ryder Cup is played
in 2001 at The Belfry in Sutton Coldfield, England, Europe will be
determined to win the cup back. But Sunday, it was finally the
Americans' turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left here last night,'' Crenshaw allowed, ``I said,
`We're in good shape.' Darned if we didn't pull it off.''

EXPERTS SUSPECT MORE DIED OF ENCEPHALITIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having discovered that they have most likely been
looking for the wrong virus, public health officials are
investigating whether as many as eight more people than previously
reported have died in New York City's mysterious encephalitis
outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, local health officials had attributed three deaths
to the epidemic, with 15 more people infected in New York City and
Westchester County. The disease, they said, was St. Louis
encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   But now that additional laboratory tests have detected the
presence of a different virus in some of those who died during the
outbreak, officials are confronting the possibility that the scope
of the epidemic may may be greater than they first thought.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal Cohen, the New York City health commissioner, said
Sunday that blood and spinal fluid samples from 77 people who
tested negative for St. Louis encephalitis would now be re-examined
for the new virus, identified as the West Nile virus, or a close
variant known as the Kunjin virus.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of those 77 people later died, but their deaths were not
publicly attributed to the epidemic, because they had tested
negative for St. Louis encephalitis, Cohen said. ``It would have
been irresponsible for us to give the public the perception that
people that were dying who tested negative were related to this
outbreak,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that approach has changed now that tests have indicated the
presence of the West Nile or Kunjin virus in one of the seven
people who died after testing negative for St. Louis encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Smith, a spokeswoman for the state Department of
Health, said Sunday that a total of eight deaths during the
outbreak have been ``associated with clinical encephalitis
symptoms.'' Three of those deaths, she said, were reported to state
officials late last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we know what to look for,'' Ms. Smith said. ``We were
looking for St. Louis encephalitis, and we weren't finding it. If
we know exactly what we are looking for, it's going to be easier to
find it.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Cohen said, city officials are now investigating whether
the West Nile or Kunjin viruses were present in 11 of the people
who died during the outbreak. He cautioned, however, that several
of those deaths may not have been related to encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   Brain samples from seven people who died have been sent, or are
en route, to the Emerging Diseases Laboratory at the University of
California at Irvine, said Dr. Ian Lipkin, director of the center.
This is the laboratory that last week first identified the virus as
either the West Nile, found in Africa, or the Kunjin, found in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Neither virus has ever been detected in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Friday, the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention also detected a West Nile-like virus in brain tissue
extracted from one person who died, confirming the initial results
from the California lab. The CDC has also detected the virus in
dead birds found in the New York City region.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the findings have caused public health officials
to revisit many of the same questions they were asking at the
outset of the epidemic in August: Where did it come from? How
widely has it spread?
</P>
<P>
   ``The scope of the epidemic, we want to get as firm a grip on it
as we can,'' Ms. Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Sunday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani acknowledged
that the health toll may turn out to be higher now that scientists
are focusing on a different disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we anticipate is over the next day or two they probably
are going to reclassify a number of cases as Nile fever that
previously had not been found to be St. Louis encephalitis,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not new cases,'' he added. ``These are
reclassifications of old cases. And in most situations, the people
have already been released from the hospital, and there may be a
few fatalities that had been borderline cases that will be
described as Nile fever.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was unclear Sunday why the initial testing for St. Louis
encephalitis did not detect the West Nile or Kunjin viruses. Cohen
referred questions on this subject to the CDC, which conducted many
of the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Stewart, a spokeswoman for the CDC, said that the
initial tests were not as precise as subsequent tests. What's more,
she said, results from the early tests were difficult to interpret
because of the close similarities among various strains of viruses
that can result in encephalitis. ``It's a question of reading the
strength of the reactivity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lipkin, whose laboratory uses molecular diagnostic testing to
identify the genetic footprints of new viruses, called the
detection of the West Nile or Kunjin viruses ``very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you find a new virus in a new ecological niche,
that's interesting in its own right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The finding presents numerous questions, whose answers, he said,
could have a ``profound impact'' on the long-term development of
medical treatments for a whole range of viruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinically, from the standpoint of public health in 1999, it
doesn't make any difference,'' Lipkin said. ``But think, for
example, how long people worked on HIV before there were effective
anti-virals for that. Unless you know what the agents are, how can
you possibly develop an effective strategy?''
</P>
<P>
   While the discovery of a new virus in this hemisphere is
considered scientifically significant, Giuliani said it had no
practical impact on the city's response to the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that we have to do about it are exactly the same,''
he said Sunday. ``So although there is a reclassification of the
disease, the things that the city or any city would have to do are
essentially the same. You have to spray to reduce dramatically the
insect population. Both diseases are carried in the same way _ by
birds to mosquitoes and then to human beings. And the symptoms,
although not as severe, are roughly the same, so the treatment is
essentially the same.''

SPRAYING OF INSECTICIDE BY CITY MAY HARM MIGRATING MONARCHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Each September and October, many thousands of monarch
butterflies pass through New York City on their way from the
Northeast and Canada to Mexico for the winter. But with the city
spraying insecticide to kill mosquitoes that may carry
encephalitis, there is concern that this leg of an already
treacherous migration could prove more dangerous than usual.
</P>
<P>
   And while this year's butterfly migration began with near-record
numbers, no one can know if it might have been even larger without
the spraying of the insecticide malathion.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Spevak, the curator of invertebrates at the Bronx Zoo,
said he received a call last week from a jogger who had found a
number of dead monarch butterflies in Central Park shortly after
the spraying.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was running shortly after the truck passed,'' he said,
``and she started noticing all these monarchs dropping around
her.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned that it would be ``very difficult to determine'' if
malathion had killed the butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that Bronx Zoo officials have asked the city not to
spray over the zoo because of the danger to its Butterfly Zone
exhibit, a caterpillar-shaped tent that houses hundreds of
butterflies from around the world. Instead, zoo workers have
sprayed specific trouble spots themselves, Spevak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to destroy the migration,'' he said. ``But the
migration itself is an ecological phenomenon found nowhere else in
the world. This is just something else to hinder its progress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the city does spray, it can wipe out a few hundred, even
a few thousand, and in a migration of 100 million monarchs, that's
very small. But every little bit seems to nibble away at the
chain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Glassberg, president of the North American Butterfly
Association, based in Morristown, N.J., questioned the wholesale
spraying of malathion, preferring more selective methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spraying for mosquitoes can have a dramatic effect on
butterfly populations,'' he said. ``I think it's an extremely
unfortunate situation.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Monarch butterflies are being spotted at a vigorous rate of 106
an hour at the Cape May Bird Observatory. On Sept. 19 and Sept. 20,
butterflies that might have been hunkering down during tropical
storm Hugo took wing in large numbers, said Nicholas Wagerik, an
amateur naturalist who studies wildlife in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed it in Manhattan, and in other places, people said it
was just spectacular,'' he said. ``Every flower in Brooklyn Heights
had a monarch on it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to pesticides, migrating monarchs face another
obstacle particular to urban areas: they must leap tall buildings
using very small wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some research showing they don't try to go around
buildings,'' said Dick Walton, director of the Monarch Monitoring
Project in Cape May, part of the New Jersey Audubon Society.
Instead, he said, they go up and over buildings, riding rising air
currents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monarchs migrate by using thermals, rising columns of air, to
gain altitude,'' Walton said. ``Then they set their wings and go
south from that. It's like going up an elevator and going south,
then going up another elevator.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had to flap the whole way, they just wouldn't make it.
It's a high-risk occupation, with some of that due to traffic, and
more to weather, when monarchs are blown out into sea.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, as a very few monarch butterflies slid by in the
wind, Don Riepe, a naturalist at the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge,
worried why there weren't more.
</P>
<P>
   Four thousand migrating monarchs passed over Rockaway Beach on
Sept. 19, according to Riepe's count, but late in the week, the
wind had shifted, so any southbound butterflies were probably
waiting for a tailwind in the shelter of the undergrowth. Still, he
wondered if the city's spraying campaign might have had something
to do with the absence of wings in the air. He also worried about
damage to eggs and caterpillars, which grow into monarchs and other
butterflies, after the spraying of the leaves they live on.
</P>
<P>
   New York City has 85 species of butterflies, more than are found
in all of England, Glassberg said. The Jamaica Bay refuge counts
among its visitors the wild indigo duskywing, the little wood
satyr, the swarthy skipper and the cosmopolitan painted lady.
</P>
<P>
   Honeybees are also at risk from malathion. Labels on some
packages of malathion read ``Toxic to bees, do not spray blooms.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   David Graves, who works with urban beekeepers and sells New York
City honey to markets in Manhattan, said it was good for the bees
that the spraying occurs at night, when they are back in their
hives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This encephalitis is quite dangerous, and human life is the
number one concern,'' he said. ``So certainly, if it can save one
or two lives, then the spraying is a good thing.'' Because the
nectar that bees use to make honey is sealed within a flower's
blossoms, it is unlikely that the spraying would contaminate urban
honey, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Mullin, a spokeswoman for the New York City Health
Department, acknowledged that insecticides like malathion can
affect other insects, but she said she could not talk specifically
about bees and butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it remains to be seen what impact that may have had on
insects other than mosquitoes,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After a long, dry summer that did not inspire her rooftop bees
to produce much honey, Jill Laurie Goodman, of West 113th Street,
added over the weekend another ``super'' to one of her hives _ a
box of honeycomb that would accommodate a recent overflow of
nectar.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Melvin Bukiet, had different ideas about
the effects of the spraying.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are tough New York City bees. They can handle it,''
Bukiet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't know,'' Ms. Goodman replied. ``These are tough
New York City mosquitoes, unfortunately.'' &QL;

 NEW MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY CREATES ONLINE `HOUSE CALLS'
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BENNY EVANGELISTA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ Each morning when 82-year-old Jack Watt awakens, he
takes his blood pressure, times his pulse and checks his weight.
</P>
<P>
   Watt has a continuing heart condition and a high red blood cell
count that require constant medical monitoring. But thanks to an
emerging use of technology in the medical field, he doesn't have to
leave his Scotts Valley trailer home to check in with his doctor.
</P>
<P>
   He just sits at his computer, logs on to the Internet and enters
his daily vital signs, which then can be read by a nurse at a
health company data center in South San Francisco, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those numbers begin to bounce around, then I can expect a
call from one of the nurses, who asks me what's going on,'' Watt
said. ``There's a sense of security and a feeling that I just can't
lose as long as I keep putting (the data) in.''
</P>
<P>
   In-person doctor house calls, a common practice when Watt
started his career as a building inspector for the city of San
Mateo (Calif.) shortly after World War II, have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But now Watt is on the leading edge of a new medical trend that
could become commonplace in just a few short years: the virtual
house call.
</P>
<P>
   Digital doctors and Net nurses won't replace their real
counterparts in hospitals or clinics. But a combination of
computers or new home medical devices and the Internet could keep
certain at-risk patients from winding up in the hospital for urgent
_ and expensive _ treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The Web already is littered with thousands of health care sites
that dispense every type of medical advice imaginable. Now, experts
say, personalized online home health management is the next big
revolution in the medical industry.
</P>
<P>
   Watt, who had an aortic valve replacement two years ago, is part
of a pilot online network set up by LifeMasters, a disease
management company with headquarters in Newport Beach (Calif.) and
a call center in South San Francisco (Calif.).
</P>
<P>
   With the LifeMasters system, Watt types his vital signs and any
symptoms daily into a computer and transmits them to the data
center. LifeMasters provided the computer and the service free for
the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses hired by LifeMasters monitor his health data and look for
any unusual changes, such as a sudden weight gain, that might
require immediate attention. The patients and their doctors can
access the information on a private Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Starting October 1, LifeMasters, which has Intel Corp. as a
major investor, will team up with TheHealthNetwork.com, which
operates a consumer health cable TV network and an Internet site,
to offer the same type of online medical services directly to
consumers. LifeMasters will launch  &LR; both  &LR; a free service and a more
personalized version for an undetermined subscription fee.
</P>
<P>
   Online monitoring programs are best suited for chronic diseases
like congestive heart failure, diabetes and high blood pressure,
which are the most costly for health plans to treat if left
unchecked. The programs can also be used to monitor conditions such
as asthma and depression.
</P>
<P>
   Health Hero Network Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., is marketing
an answering machine-size home appliance called the Health Buddy
for patients with chronic problems. As with the LifeMasters system,
the Health Buddy asks patients to punch in their vital signs and
answer questions posed by their doctors such as, ``Did you have
trouble breathing last night?''
</P>
<P>
   The answers are transmitted to an Internet site, where they can
be accessed by the physician.
</P>
<P>
   Alere Medical Inc. of San Francisco announced last week during a
meeting of the Heart Failure Society of America that it is
launching a physician-to-patient Internet system using its device,
the DayLink Monitor. The monitor is an electronic weight scale with
a view screen that displays daily health questions and transmits
the answers to a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   At the same trade show, held in San Francisco, Hewlett-Packard
Co.'s $1.3 billion-per-year medical products division displayed new
home medical devices equipped with cordless radio transmitters.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic blood pressure cuff, electrocardiogram and weight
scale each can automatically beam the patient's data to a home
network hub, which is plugged into a phone jack. From there, the
data are transmitted to an Internet site for retrieval by the
patient's doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to keep the patients out of the hospital by
keeping them healthier and happier, which helps health plans save
money,'' said Tom Shoup, operations manager for HP's New Clinical
Ventures group, which is seeking Federal Drug Administration
approval to market the new devices.
</P>
<P>
   All major health care providers around the country are looking
at some type of online patient monitoring to lower costs, said Dr.
David Kaplan, a health industry consultant for management firm
Towers Perrin &UR;  &LR; of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   There are new online health tracking products ``coming up every
day'' and the market is potentially huge, Kaplan said. ``With the
aging of the population, there will be more people with these
chronic diseases who might indeed benefit from this kind of
technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a 1997 study by the American College of Cardiology
found that treatment for the estimated 4.8 million Americans with
congestive heart failure costs as much as $38 billion per year,
including $23 million for hospitalization. Other studies showed
education, daily review of medications and close monitoring could
reduce readmissions by more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Online monitoring can reveal subtle symptoms not normally
detected unless the patient visits the doctor daily. For example,
an overnight weight gain of 5 pounds may be caused by eating too
many pieces of a large pepperoni pizza, or could be a sign the
patient is retaining fluid that is making it more difficult for the
heart to pump.
</P>
<P>
   Health Hero Network CEO Steve Brown said he can sell his
company's service to HMOs and other health care providers for less
than $1 a day per patient. ``Our basic value proposition to our
customers is to replace a $10,000 hospitalization with a $100
office visit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Software programs used with the online monitoring can flag a
sudden weight gain so a nurse or doctor can follow up to learn if
the patient has a simple problem or one that requires immediate
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 10 percent of the cases, we found it was not because they
ate something wrong,'' said LifeMasters CEO Christobel E. Selecky.
``We've created a feedback loop that never existed before.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry ``Hut'' Hutton and his wife, Shirl Hutton, have heart
conditions and use the LifeMasters online system.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Cruz (Calif.) couple, both in their late 70s, became
concerned when Hut Hutton's blood pressure was higher just after he
woke up than later in the day. So, two weeks ago, his doctor
changed his medication schedule to help even out his blood pressure
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can turn the tide by breaking his medication into
two doses,'' Shirl Hutton said. ``Without the daily blood pressure
monitoring, we never would have noticed his blood pressure was so
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Cupertino resident Ed Madden, 78, used the LifeMasters program
until his medical group, the Santa Clara County (Calif.) Individual
Practice Association, switched to the Health Buddy about three
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Madden said he has had heart problems for 15 years and has
landed in the hospital several times ``because my heart goes wacky
on me,'' but the two online monitoring programs have helped him
lead a healthier lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go to the grocery store, we never buy anything without
turning it over and reading the nutritional facts,'' Madden said.
``The Health Buddy is a self-disciplining tool. You get to where
you're aware of what you're doing, what you're eating and what
exercise you need.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts in the medical community say there is no longer a debate
about whether online technology should be used to treat patients in
their homes, only a question of what is the most effective use of
that technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just at the tip of the iceberg in terms of using this
kind of technology to gather data and trying to figure out how to
implement this in a proactive way to keep patients out of the
hospital,'' said Dr. Alan Giberson, associate medical director of
the Santa Clara County Individual Practice Association, which has
800 physicians and 125,000 HMO members.
</P>
<P>
   Giberson said there are about 35 association patients like
Madden now using the Health Buddy. Although there is not enough
meaningful data available to prove how well the device works, ``we
think we have prevented some hospitalizations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Aria DiBiase, a cardiologist at the Palo Alto (Calif.)
Medical Foundation, said he has about 27 patients using the Alere
DayLink Monitor. While historically about half of congestive heart
failure patients are hospitalized in a year, DiBiase said only six
in the Alere group have required hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no substitute for face-to-face encounters,'' said
DiBiase, who is also a board member of Alere Medical. But, she
said, the daily monitoring has helped because ``I have several
patients who are not going to call me unless they are in dire
straits.''
</P>
<P>
   Having technology that is easy to use is key, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average age of the patients is 79. We're talking about
using technology in a way that can interface with very disabled,
very technophobic people. These are not people who are surfing the
Net; these are people who still have rotary phones.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirl Hutton said she has embraced the technology, which has
given her the information and support to cope with her own heart
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having my own cheering section for my health,'' she
said. ``It makes me more secure that I can function more
independently. I've never met my nurse face to face, but I feel as
though I have already hugged her. We have a warm log-in
relationship.''

SPORTS COLUMN: JETS AND METS PRODUCE A SPLIT-SCREEN NIGHTMARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Fifteen days ago everything seemed so
certain: The football Jets began their Super Bowl quest on top of
the world; the baseball Mets were two and a half games ahead of
Cincinnati for the wild-card berth and breathing down Atlanta's
neck for the division title.
</P>
<P>
   Jets and Mets fans wake up Monday morning to a world of
shattered dreams and shrunken horizons. The Jets lost by 27-10 to
Washington Sunday and fell to 0-3. The Mets lost by 3-2 in
Philadelphia for their sixth consecutive defeat. A football team
that was thinking Super Bowl is wondering if it will win again; a
baseball team that seriously considered a division championship
might not even make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In a little more than two weeks, New Yorkers have seen the Jets
and the Mets unravel, have watched a manager offer his head on a
platter and a head coach who was said to be able to walk on water
consider using water wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough time for me,'' Jets coach Bill Parcells said
Sunday. ``This continues to be a tough time until we figure out how
to handle this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday I was at Giants Stadium with my radio, switching
between watching the Jets and listening to the Mets and not
believing what I was seeing and hearing.
</P>
<P>
   This was an afternoon of contrasting fortunes for the city's
Little Engine That Could teams, and if you walked around the
stadium you heard collective moans and groans from Jets fans who
were also Mets fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets took a 14-13 lead in the third quarter at the same time
Philadelphia increased its lead to 3-0 over the Mets. Just as the
Jets fell behind Washington for good, the Mets had a last-gasp
rally in the ninth, loading the bases with one out and Rickey
Henderson at bat. Giants Stadium was a cacophony of baseball cheers
and football roars.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans had their ears glued to radios and eyes riveted on the
field, ever hopeful of a double miracle. One seemed to unfold at
Giants Stadium when Keyshawn Johnson, the Jets' talented wide
receiver, caught an apparent touchdown pass that would have pulled
the Jets to within 27-24. But the play was reviewed and the catch
negated. Fans simultaneously received bad news from Philadelphia:
Henderson hit into a game-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Since just last Tuesday, these two franchises, which have
overcome so much stumbling to reach respectability, find themselves
in the midst of a nightmare. On Saturday, Mets manager Bobby
Valentine offered his head if the Mets were to fail in reaching the
postseason. ``If we don't go to the playoffs,'' he said, ``I
shouldn't come back next year.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Parcells, who would never admit that kind of
vulnerability or second-guessing, stood before reporters for the
first time up to his knees in Jets mess: fumbles, botched
assignments, blown calls and blown plays that ripped the heart out
of his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm biting my lip,'' he said. ``This is the first time I had
to bite my lip in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Biting his lip about what? The officiating? The Jets were
penalized eight times for 86 yards.
</P>
<P>
   A pass interference call against Ray Mickens led to Washington's
go-ahead touchdown. An assortment of holding penalties killed other
Jet drives. Rick Mirer fumbled, Mickens was called for another pass
interference, and Washington then went ahead, 20-17. Late in the
game, the officials ruled that a Stephen Davis fumble, which was
picked up by the Jets' Aaron Glenn, was not really a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe Parcells was biting his lip because of the failure of
his offensive coordinator to find a way to consistently get the
ball to Johnson. Johnson, the Jets' only game-breaking threat on
offense, had one catch in the first half. He finished with three,
even though he was being covered by a rookie defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Parcells was biting his lip to avoid blasting Mickens, who
was beaten on several plays and penalized three times for pass
interference.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Parcells is exploding at the frustration of an 0-3 team
and a free fall with no end in sight. He didn't offer his
resignation, as Valentine has, or take the blame for his team's
failure. He just said, ``It doesn't look very good right now.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure if the Jets or the Mets have farther to fall. The
Mets open with Atlanta Tuesday and could be out of the playoff
picture by Thursday night. The Jets have to travel a longer, more
tortuous road: They have 13 weeks to figure out a solution or 13
weeks to dangle.
</P>
<P>
   This has the potential to be one of the most depressing autumn
interludes in recent New York sports seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In the somber chaos of the Jets' locker room _ some players
staying to talk, others scurrying to get away _ Bryan Cox, the
veteran linebacker, said that all he wanted to do was get a hug
from his kids, relax and go home and listen to some jazz.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure whether Cox likes Miles Davis, but he might want to
try ``Kind of Blue.''

CELEBRATION ANGERS EUROPEANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GLF-RYDER-CUP) 
(js) 
 By BILL BRINK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Flattened by a U.S. team that was roaring
toward the biggest comeback in Ryder Cup history, the best golfers
in Europe left here Sunday stunned by their defeat and irritated by
the behavior of the U.S. golfers and their fans. Though most of the
combativeness involved the galleries at The Country Club the past
week, on Sunday the Europeans targeted the U.S. players for what
they believed was an excessive celebration on the 17th green late
in the day.
</P>
<P>
   While many of his teammates sat by the side of the green and
cheered him on, Justin Leonard rolled in a spectacular 45-foot putt
that was, in effect, the winning stroke in the competition. He
pumped his fists and ran along the edge of the green to join his
colleagues in a joyous mob, all while Jose Maria Olazabal waited to
hit a putt that could have halved the hole and kept the match tied.
After waiting for the celebration to die down, and stepping away
from his ball once, Olazabal missed his putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of behavior is not what anybody expects,'' Olazabal
said later at a news conference in which a number of Europeans
conducted what seemed like a group lecture on civility. ``It was
very sad to see. It was an ugly picture to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotion, yes. But I think we proved that most of the time we
behaved like we should.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the 1997 Ryder Cup in Spain. ``I think we showed
that at Valderrama,'' he said. ``I don't want to make a whole thing
of this. It just shouldn't have happened. Show respect for your
opponent. As long as you do that, you can cheer all you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Colin Montgomerie, who sparred all week with American
spectators, was playing behind Leonard and Olazabal and waiting to
tee off on the par-3 hole. ``I couldn't believe what I was
seeing,'' he said. ``I couldn't believe it. I thought they'd all
just walk off and head to the 18th green. I couldn't believe it
cleared and he was left on his own to make a putt.''
</P>
<P>
   As Montgomerie was explaining that he did not think the incident
affected the outcome of the competition, Jesper Parnevik
interrupted and said, ``But that's not the point, is it?''
</P>
<P>
   The European captain, Mark James, said, ``I would like to think
it wouldn't happen with my team,'' but he added that he did not
expect an apology from his counterpart, Ben Crenshaw. He got one
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know what happened,'' Crenshaw said. ``We do apologize
sincerely. The celebration spilled over. It's really something
we're not proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard later took the blame, saying he should not have run on
the green toward his teammates but should have walked to them. ``I
do apologize for that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Europeans congratulated the Americans and praised
their play. ``We came up short because the Americans rode a great
streak,'' James said. ``It's as simple as that.''

MAYOR'S THREATS MAKE EXHIBITION A HOT TOPIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani accused the Brooklyn Museum of
Art on Sunday of resorting to ``disgusting commercial
sensationalism'' in planning to exhibit modern British works that
he said were offensive to Catholics, but it was the mayor's
repeated threats against the museum that kept the exhibit a buzzing
topic of conversation throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   In church services and across tables over Sunday brunch, on the
streets, in the parks and in the corridors of the Brooklyn Museum
itself, the brouhaha showed no sign of letting up. And the opinions
of New Yorkers suggested that the debate was not simply one of free
expression but of who should pay to put free expression on display.
</P>
<P>
   That the mayor's attacks have already drawn great attention to
the exhibit was clear Sunday afternoon, when Kim Gosa, 33, of
Jersey City, N.J., arrived at the museum thinking that the show,
which is to open on Saturday, was already on display. ``I'm going
to come back next week to see what it's all about for myself,'' she
said. ``I'm actually very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who last week threatened to terminate the museum's
lease with the city, cut all of its city financing and even seize
control of the museum's board of directors if the show was not
canceled, was unrelenting Sunday. Told that some museum officials
wanted to meet with him, the mayor, at his daily news conference,
said he did not think anything useful could come of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am baffled by what they have done,'' he said. ``I do not
understand why you would take a venerable institution like this and
reduce it to the worst kind of disgusting commercial
sensationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I understand they want to make money, but this is
what you do like on the 42nd Street of about 20 years ago, not what
you do at a venerable and great museum.''
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly homily at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Sunday,
Cardinal John O'Connor did not mention Giuliani by name, but he
expressed gratitude to ``city officials'' and said, ``It is their
right, if not their duty, to express themselves on such matters.''
He urged parishioners to write to the museum to express offense at
the show, which features a portrait of the Virgin Mary adorned with
pornographic pictures and elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am saddened by what appears to be an attack not only on our
Blessed Mother,'' the cardinal said, adding, ``one must ask if it
is not an attack on religion itself and in a special way on the
Catholic Church.''
</P>
<P>
   But in another church, in Harlem, Norman Siegel, the executive
director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, offered to go to
court on behalf of the Brooklyn Museum to protect the show.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel, who was a guest speaker at St. Mary's Episcopal Church,
said after the Sunday service that he was eager to represent the
museum against the Giuliani administration. ``If the museum wants
us, we will go to court for them,'' he said. ``We are ready,
willing and able to go to court. I think this would be a landmark
First Amendment decision that unfortunately has been created by the
mayor.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He noted that the show, called ``Sensation: Young British
Artists From the Saatchi Collection,'' had already been on display
in England and in Germany. ``London dealt with this exhibit,'' he
said. ``Berlin dealt with this exhibit. Are we saying that New York
can't do what London and Berlin did with regard to this exhibit?''
He also criticized other museums for not defending their sister
institution in Brooklyn more vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Herbert Daughtry, pastor of the House of the Lord
Church in Brooklyn, told The Associated Press on Sunday that he
disagreed with the mayor. ``If the mayor wants to protest this
artwork as a citizen, it's one thing,'' he said, ``but to say, `I'm
going to use the machinery of government to punish you,' it borders
on dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Field, 18, a freshman at Pratt Institute, who was visiting
the museum on Sunday, said he was outraged by Giuliani's threats.
``I don't believe the government should fund individual artists,''
he said. ``But funding shouldn't be taken away from the museum. To
say, `This show is offensive, we're cutting the funding,' is
absurd. I find the mayor offensive, but that doesn't mean I'm going
to stop paying my taxes.''

 DELL AND GATEWAY PUSH DIRECT PC MARKETING
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By HENRY NORR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ Families planning to put a new PC under the tree
this Christmas are more likely than ever to bypass local dealers
and instead order directly from the manufacturer by phone or over
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   And while virtually every major PC-maker now sells some of its
products this way, the two big winners from this trend are likely
to be the two companies that pioneered direct-to-the-customer
sales, Dell and Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is coming on strong in the consumer arena, after
concentrating for years on business buyers. But Gateway still holds
a long lead and continues to build on its base with a new network
of local showrooms and other marketing innovations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Dell turned up the heat last week with a barrage of marketing
initiatives aimed at home users, backed by a new TV and print ad
campaign under the rubric ``Dell4Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the announcements: the first Dell notebook PC that isn't
black _ the Inspiron 3700, priced at $1,899 and up, will be
available in either ``Storm Grey'' or ``Tahoe Blue.'' Dell is also
moving to capitalize on The downloadable digital music craze,
announcing plans to include MP3 software and offer the RIO 500, the
latest version of the pocket-sized MP3 player from Diamond
Multimedia, as an option with some models.
</P>
<P>
   To further differentiate itself from retail competitors, Dell
also offers to preconfigure its systems with advanced networking
options. Last week it announced a deal with the ExciteAtHome cable
Internet service, under which Dell customers will be able to add
high-speed Internet access when ordering a consumer desktop or a
notebook PC. Dell promises it will take care of all the necessary
arrangements, so customers won't have to make extra calls to
ExciteAtHome or their cable company.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also plans to offer products and services to customers who
want to connect multiple PCs into a home network through their
telephone wiring. The company plans to launch the program within a
few weeks, when key players in the networking industry are expected
to ratify a new standard promising faster data transfers. Dell said
it's also working hard to simplify setup, previously a daunting
experience, by creating its own clear directions, an interactive CD
tutorial and a video guide.
</P>
<P>
   In offering such services, Dell is simply building on its
traditional advantages, said Dataquest analyst Van Baker. ``They're
just leveraging their longtime leadership in the direct market,''
he said. ``Competitors who sell through dealers can't very well put
together packages like these, because they wouldn't sell enough.
But Dell can strike these deals with the telecom companies and
music companies, and if even a few customers want the products,
they can get just what they want with one order.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell's push into the consumer arena is built on its success in
the business market, where it recently passed Compaq as the No. 1
PC supplier. ``They have execution down to a science in the
commercial space,'' said IDC analyst Gabrielle Griffith. ``Now that
the consumer market is exploding, there's a huge opportunity for
them to leverage their success.''
</P>
<P>
   Dataquest's Baker pointed out another way its huge business base
gives Dell a leg up in the consumer race: ``A lot of people use
Dell PCs at work and like what they see,'' he said, ``so when
they're in the market for a home PC, it's natural for them to look
to the same supplier.''
</P>
<P>
   An experienced customer base has another advantage &UR;  &LR; for both
companies, but especially for Dell: Second- and third-time buyers
tend to purchase more powerful PCs and advanced options, such as
the company's new broadband and home-networking options. That
translates into higher average selling prices and much fatter
margins, compared with the sub-$600 systems that increasingly
dominate retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In the second quarter of this year, for example, the average
selling price of Dell PCs purchased by U.S. consumers was $1,765,
including a monitor and other add-ons, according to IDC. For
Gateway, the comparable number was $1,586, while for Compaq it was
only $1,301.
</P>
<P>
   While Baker and other analysts are bullish on Dell, Gateway
still enjoys a substantial lead and a record of innovation in the
consumer PC arena. And the company, which now has corporate
headquarters in San Diego, Calif., but still boasts about its roots
in South Dakota, has long cultivated a down-to-earth, just-folks
image, in contrast to Dell's image as a favorite of big business
and the high-tech elite.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway's most visible recent initiative is its Country Store
program, under which it has opened local showrooms and marketing
centers in 185 cities around the country. (The first in the Sab
Francisco Bay Area is in Colma.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the name, these facilities aren't stores in the
traditional sense, because they have no inventory, just demo units,
on hand. Customers can come in, examine Gateway products and talk
to salespeople, then place their orders at the store or go home and
order later over the phone or the Internet. The equipment is
shipped to the customer from Gateway's assembly plants, typically
arriving within five to seven days.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to satisfying some customers' need to ``kick the
tires,'' having local facilities allows Gateway to offer programs
it would be tough for Dell to match, such as training classes and
consulting services.
</P>
<P>
   The stores are by no means Gateway's first innovation in
consumer marketing. ``Gateway has always had the leading thinking
in the consumer space,'' said Lou Mazzuchelli, analyst at Gerard
Klauer Mattison. It was first among major PC vendors to create its
own Internet service, Gateway.net, launched almost two years ago;
Dell didn't come up with a similar program until July of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway also pioneered Your:)Ware, a financing program, launched
in May 1998, that allows buyers to pay for a PC in monthly
installments. It also offers some degree of protection against
obsolescence _ a major fear for many consumers _ by promising a
credit if the customer wants to trade in the machine for a newer
model. In June of this year, Dell launched a 48-month payment
program, but without the trade-up option.
</P>
<P>
   And while no one would compare Gateway to Steve Jobs' Apple in
innovative design, the company has shown some notable sparks of
creativity, with models like te Destination, which combines a PC
with a big-screen TV, and the Profile, a pricey but elegant
all-in-one unit built around a sleek flat-screen monitor. And
company officials say they'll have yet another eye-catching new
model later this fall.
</P>
<P>
   While Dell still focuses on experienced PC users, the Country
Stores and other Gateway innovations have helped it win over
increasing numbers of novices. Traditionally, many such buyers have
hesitated to deal with far-away direct vendors, on the theory that
a local dealer would provide better service and support. But that
logic, analysts say, no longer holds, because both Dell and Gateway
are so big, and have invested so heavily in customer service, that
they now offer much better support than almost any local dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the two leaders, for example, provide lifetime toll-free
support on most models, and it's available 24 hours a day, seven
days a week. Both have also developed sophisticated online support
technologies, making it easy for users to find help on the Web.
Dell licensed search technology from AskJeeves and used to build a
site called AskDudley, where customers can pose their questions in
plain English and get immediate answers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers' increasing familiarity and comfort with e-commerce is
also helping the two direct-sales leaders. For users who've learned
to buy CDs, pet food, cars and almost everything else over the Web,
it's no big deal to buy a new PC that way.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, both companies are in a strong position in the
consumer market, analysts say. ``There's more room for Dell to grow
in this segment, because they're starting from behind,'' said
Baker, ``but Gateway still has a big lead with consumers, and Dell
isn't likely to catch them anytime soon.''

EDITORIAL: THE SENATE'S OILY DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 27:
</P>
<P>
   Though it was little noticed at the time, a donnybrook over
Senate rules last week illustrated the outsized role of special
interests in government. The issue was a money grab by oil
businesses, which want to lower the royalties they have to pay the
government for drilling on federal land. When Sen. Russell Feingold
of Wisconsin tried to block an amendment that would let them keep
their royalty payments artificially low, and pointed out that
oil-sector campaign donations were calling the shots, several
senators objected. Their reason? Feingold's recitation of campaign
donations was not ``germane'' and therefore not allowed during the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   How quaint of the senators to disparage the germaneness of
campaign contributions. In fact, nothing could be more relevant
than the power of donors to call the tune in Congress. Fortunately,
Feingold was allowed to continue, in spite of complaints from Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, the amendment's sponsor, and Sen.
Craig Thomas of Wyoming. Unfortunately, the measure passed. The
bill to which it is attached contains objectionable
anti-environmental features, and President Clinton should veto it.
</P>
<P>
   It is perverse for the Senate to cut school aid, housing and
other domestic programs on the ground that the budget needs to be
balanced, and then to cut revenues even more by handing out a big
break to oil companies. Feingold, in raising the campaign reform
issue, knew that simply pointing out what everyone knows is true
would be embarrassing. If embarrassment moves the senators to act,
it should be not to stop someone from telling the truth, but to
pass the ban on unlimited ``soft money'' to parties sponsored by
Feingold and John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold likes to point out that he is an heir to the Senate
seat of Robert La Follette, the progressive hero of nearly a
century ago, who used to ``call the roll'' of railroads and other
big donors who got their way in government. La Follette's ability
to embarrass his colleagues led eventually to the ban on corporate
donations to individual candidates of 1907, a ban that is now being
undone by the ``soft money'' scam whereby the money is given to
parties, not candidates. Feingold's ``Calling of the Bankroll'' has
pointed out how health insurance donors influenced legislation
governing health-maintenance organizations, how the tax-cut bill
got packed with treats for businesses, and how big donations by
Chevron, Atlantic Richfield and BP Amoco led to the break on oil
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   This season of Republican-touted budget restraint was enlivened
by the influence of a different special interest in the defense
area. Trent Lott, the majority leader, wants a half billion dollars
to start building a ship, the LHD-8. The Navy says it does not need
the money or the ship. Naturally, the Senate has approved the
money. Not all spending restraint is healthy, at least to some
senators. Perhaps it is germane to point out that the ship would be
built at a shipyard in Lott's home state of Mississippi.

 HERB ADVOCATE CALLS FOR MORE RESEARCH AND RULES ON SUPPLEMENTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TOM ABATE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ Bill McGlashan is one of those rare executives who
wants more &LR;   &LR; regulation of his industry. As president of Pharmanex,
a Burlingame (Calif.) maker of herbal remedies, McGlashan explained
his unusual wish.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmanex is among dozens of firms that sell herbal supplements
like St. John's Wort, echinacea and ginseng. Many Americans seem to
believe that an herb a day keeps the doctor away. That might
account for the fact that domestic spending on herbals has doubled
since 1994, to an estimated $4.5 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   But McGlashan isn't content to rely on folk wisdom to sustain
the American appetite for potions. He wants to do scientific
studies that would ask, for instance, whether a chemical in green
tea fights cancer.
</P>
<P>
   As consumers, we might applaud Pharmanex for funding such
studies, but as investors, we'd have to ask whether McGlashan
hasn't been smoking something herbal.
</P>
<P>
   It all gets back to the laws that govern his business _ laws
that McGlashan wants to tighten.
</P>
<P>
   At present, herb sales are governed by the Dietary Supplements
and Health Education Act.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike drugs, which must be tested and approved in advance by
the Food and Drug Administration, DSHEA assumes that herbs are safe
because people have been consuming them for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But DSHEA prevents herb vendors from making health claims. If a
manufacturer can't advertise that echinacea wards off flu, for
instance, what incentive would a company have to study whether the
folk wisdom is true?
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to spend $15 million on research this year, and a lot
of it ends up being like philanthropy,'' McGlashan says.
</P>
<P>
   If his study shows a health benefit for green tea, for example,
he can't tout it on his label. And even if health reporters
publicize the findings, Pharmanex has to share the benefit. Any
herbmaker can bottle tea extract and cash in on Pharmanex's
findings.
</P>
<P>
   That's why McGlashan wants Congress to draft stricter rules for
herb sales modeled after laws in Germany. According to McGlashan,
German firms that sponsor research about the health benefits of
herbs get two benefits: They can put the claim on their label and
get a 10-year monopoly on the sale of the herb to establish a brand
before competing makers can offer ``generic'' herbs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, funding a study isn't the same as discovering a drug.
Some might argue that this policy would give an unfair advantage to
vendors with deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Such a rule change is hardly imminent, but key members of
Congress are aware of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking to manufacturers about how we might provide
incentives to do research on health effects,'' says an aide to
Rep. &QL; 
Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the government reform committee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McGlashan, who formed his company to commercialize
Chinese medicine, might recall the proverb: Be careful what you
wish for.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD FEUD: ``We're crazy hippies gathered in front of this
place, singing songs and trying to be heard,'' said one speaker at
a protest against genetically engineered foods held Thursday at the
Pacific Stock Exchange in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people turned out for the noontime rally organized by
Bob Cantisano, an organic farmer from Grass Valley, Calif. His
basic complaint is that current rules assume genetically engineered
crops are safe. ``When pesticides came out in the 1940s and 1950s,
it was 30 years before we discovered the problems,'' Cantisano
said. ``We don't want to wait 30 years to find the problems with
G.E. foods. It should be `guilty until proven innocent.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, industry executives have started a counteroffensive
to make sure such activist sentiment doesn't become a mainstream
concern in the United States _ as already has occurred in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to reassure (consumers) and be activists somewhat
ourselves,'' Ed Shonsey, president of Novartis Seeds Inc., told
Bloomberg News. Monsanto President Hendrik Verfaillie said dealing
with the controversy over genetic engineering has become ``my No. 1
priority besides delivering financial results.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The controversy over genetic crops may be affecting the
performance of firms like Monsanto, whose shares have slid nearly
50 percent since last fall. At least that was the argument made by
the one guy who wore a suit to Thursday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investment banks have cautioned investors that G.E. foods are
a liability,'' said Thomas Van Dyck, who wore two hats _ as well as
his tie _ to the rally. Van Dyck is president of As You Sow, a
nonprofit group in Oakland, Calif., that supports organic farming.
He also is managing director of the socially responsible investing
fund for PiperJaffray in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest investors in America are teachers and their
pension funds,'' said Van Dyck, suggesting that investors, not
street protests, will determine the future of genetically
engineered crops.
</P>
<P>
   MICROBE HUNTERS: Viruses, fungi and germs, oh my!
</P>
<P>
   Those words will be on the lips of 12,000 scientists who will
gather at Moscone Center in San Francisco for the Interscience
Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, which started
yesterday and runs through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's foremost gathering of microbe hunters, ICAAC
draws three types of people who are interested in these tiny,
disease-causing organisms.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third are clinical doctors who treat a variety of
diseases, said Dr. George Miller, research chief at Microcide
Pharmaceuticals in Mountain View, Calif., and a member of the
conference's governing board. Another third are academic scientists
who develop novel disease-fighting agents. Drug and biotech
executives round out the mix.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as in years past, the conference will focus on
discoveries in the field of AIDS, the most feared viral disease.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller also expects the conference to produce a buzz about
new remedies for less deadly viral diseases like the flu or the
summer cold.
</P>
<P>
   Another important strain of discussion will be new strategies
for fighting germs or, more specifically, bacteria, which are
becoming resistant to antibiotics. Microcide is among the firms in
the early stages of testing new drugs to combat such
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Fungal infections and remedies also will be on the conference
agenda, but frankly, they haven't gotten the press of the
better-known microbes.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting microbes is a huge business. Antibacterials alone
command $23 billion in worldwide sales. So even though this is a
scientific gathering, drug and biotech firms set up commercial
displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies with products near approval want to create interest
among the clinicians,'' Miller explains. Companies about to launch
early tests also might want to set up a booth. ``It's the best
place to recruit the experimenters who will help in the clinical
trials,'' he said.

A CALM FAVRE PICKS APART THE VIKINGS' DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre had the ball
in his hands, about two minutes to go on the clock, and the
undivided attention of the Minnesota Vikings. There was a sense of
dread that he was about to do something to ruin their day. They
were right.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most exciting games this season, Green Bay beat
the Vikings, 23-20, after Favre, his team trailing by four points
with one minute 51 seconds left, took the Packers 77 yards in seven
plays, calmly tossing for the winning touchdown as the clock hit 16
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   After the score, Favre ran across the field, pumping his fists.
This is the kind of ending that could propel the Packers toward a
title and send the already struggling Vikings into a further state
of depression.
</P>
<P>
   Favre's final drive will go down as one of the best this season.
In almost John Elway-like calm, Favre slowly moved his team down
the field, eating up real estate in large and small chunks. The
Vikings, barely able to pressure him, watched helplessly as he
sliced up their defense.
</P>
<P>
   The final cut occurred on fourth-and-one at the Minnesota 23.
Favre stepped behind center with almost no visible emotion, as if
he were browsing through a library, and after dropping back and
feeling some pressure, rolled slightly to his left. That is when he
found wide receiver Corey Bradford streaking into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   When Minnesota got the ball back, quarterback Randall
Cunningham's first pass was incomplete. His second one, some 50
yards downfield, was intercepted by cornerback Antuan Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers improved to 2-1 while the Vikings fell to 1-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the way our offense constantly kept its composure,''
Favre said. ``That was just a great drive on our part.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's loss continues the bizarre downward spiral of last
year's final four teams. Atlanta, Denver and the Jets also lost
Sunday, bringing their combined record to a sorry 1-11.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough loss,'' Vikings coach Dennis Green said. ``But
we got beat by a very good team today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota-Green Bay rivalry has grown into one nasty affair.
Throughout the game, with 59,868 rabid cheeseheads cheering, there
were head butts, a few scuffles, lots of jawing by Vikings wide
receiver Cris Carter, and even a few punches to the groin.
</P>
<P>
   What there was not were those jaw-dropping deep passes to Randy
Moss. He had only one catch in the first half, a quick screen in
the flat. Superman looked very ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he was anything but average. In two games against
Green Bay last year, Moss burned the Packers for 13 catches, 343
yards and three touchdowns. In those two contests, Minnesota
compiled 885 yards of total offense and 65 points.
</P>
<P>
   The demolition of their defense through the air led the Packers
to completely revamp their defense in the off season. Green Bay
drafted cornerbacks Mike McKenzie, Edwards and Fred Vinson. Under
the new coordinator Emmitt Thomas, Green Bay is much more
aggressive on defense than it was last season.
</P>
<P>
   Something worked. Moss was nonexistent for more than three
quarters. ``They bumped Randy on almost every play,'' said Carter,
who had four catches for 85 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The game could have taken a dramatic turn in the Vikings' favor
if not for a close call involving Moss. Early in the third quarter,
with the score tied, 10-10, Minnesota faced a third-and-goal at the
Green Bay 4. Cunningham threw a fade pass to the corner of the end
zone, where Moss was sandwiched by McKenzie and safety Darren
Sharper.
</P>
<P>
   Moss made a spectacular, leaping one-handed grab, but bobbled it
on the way down. It was a close call, but the officials ruled that
Moss never had possession. Green challenged the call, but it was
not overturned.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, Cunningham went to Moss again. Same corner.
Almost the same coverage. This time, the pass was long and Moss
failed to haul it in. The Vikings settled for a 22-yard Gary
Anderson field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay later added a 35-yard field goal to tie the score at
13-13 late in the third quarter. Both Cunningham (18 of 32 for 244
yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions) and Favre (24 of 39
for 304 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions) struggled to
consistently move their offenses. Each would move his team
downfield, only to stall on third down.
</P>
<P>
   Moss finally made an impact on the game with two minutes left.
Cunningham drilled a pass 10 yards to a waiting Moss in the end
zone, and the Vikings took a 24-20 lead. Moss finished the game
with two catches for 13 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Then Favre performed his heroics. As if the two-time Super Bowl
winner was not already considered great, he added a spectacular
comeback to his resume. Elway may be forgotten sooner rather than
later.

MISTAKES RUIN JETS IN LOSS TO REDSKINS, 27-20 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It wasn't Vinny and it wasn't pretty and
although it nearly worked, the Jets were left in confusion and
their coach was left enraged.
</P>
<P>
   An improved performance by the Jets' impoverished offense was
wasted in the final quarter Sunday when the Redskins took advantage
of some charity and a couple of breaks for a come-from-behind 27-20
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The loss shocked some of the newer Jets, who had come here
confident that the team would be, at the least, a Super Bowl
contender. The Jets are heading to Denver for a rematch of last
season's American Conference championship game, but under quite
different circumstances. Neither the Jets nor the Broncos have won
a game.
</P>
<P>
   For the Jets to get to the Super Bowl now they would have to
become the first team to make it after starting 0-3. That start
represents their longest losing stretch since the infamous 1996
season of 1-15 and the longest of the Bill Parcells regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came off the chain,'' was one Jets description of how
Parcells reacted in the locker room when the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets led by 17-13 with 8 minutes 10 seconds to go, but
everything went the Redskins' way from there. First, Washington
built an 80-yard touchdown drive around two pass interference calls
on cornerback Ray Mickens. Five plays later, the Redskins recovered
quarterback Rick Mirer's fumble to set up another touchdown and
then held their breath while an apparent touchdown by receiver
Keyshawn Johnson was overruled and a possible fumble by their
running back Stephen Davis was ruled a dead ball.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Parcells said, ``This is the first time in many years
I'll have to bite my lips.'' He may have been alluding to
officials' decisions, but he refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   He was not so mysterious about his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall I thought we played a little better offensively and
defensively,'' he said. ``But it comes down to, in the end, you've
got to be able to make plays, and a couple of guys were just not
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Mickens is the newest millionaire, having signed
a deal that Parcells described last Friday as worth at least $6
million for three years. But Mickens is not the usual starter at
right cornerback. That is Otis Smith's job, and he remains
sidelined with a broken collarbone. Mickens was tagged with three
penalties on the two touchdown drives, and four penalties for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer finally showed signs that he might become a credible
replacement for Vinny Testaverde, who is out for the season.
Mirer's touchdown on the Jets' first possession Sunday was only his
second in 66 drives and nine games, dating from the end of the 1996
season. In his first 14 drives as a Jet he had produced one field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday Mirer employed seven receivers, he had Curtis Martin
and Bernie Parmalee running effectively, and he connected on three
pass plays greater than 20 yards. Overall, he hit on 17 of 31
passes for 227 yards with one touchdown and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   The touchdown pass came on a 35-yard connection to Dedric Ward
with 7:42 to go in the first quarter. The second touchdown came on
a 3-yard run by Martin and by the final period, the Jets were
nursing a 14-13 lead. The Redskins' offense, which had generated
touchdowns on its first three possessions in the 50-point outburst
against the Giants last Sunday, had only one at that point.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets committed five penalties in the first half alone,
and yet another one early in the final period proved costly.
Martin's 11-yard run to the Redskins' 5 was negated by a holding
call on Blake Spence, and the Jets wound up with a field goal by
John Hall.
</P>
<P>
   On the next possession, Washington's quarterback, Brad Johnson,
sent receiver Albert Connell against Mickens. Connell, who led all
wide receivers with five catches, was pushed on the play by
Mickens, who was tagged with a 35-yard penalty.
</P>
<P>
   That took the ball to the Jets' 18. Two plays later, Mickens was
penalized again, moving the ball from the 11 to the 4. From there,
Davis scored the second of his three touchdowns to put the Redskins
ahead, 20-17.
</P>
<P>
   On the next series, defensive end Kenard Lang stripped the ball
from Mirer, resulting in the sixth sack and Mirer's second
turnover. It positioned the Redskins on the Jets' 21. Johnson and
Connell connected again to take the ball to the 7 as the Redskins
declined another penalty against Mickens. One play later Davis
swept in for his third touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But on the following kickoff, Kevin Williams returned the ball
81 yards. Mirer then connected with a slanting Keyshawn Johnson for
a 16-yard touchdown. Replay officials overruled the call, however,
saying he did not have two feet down.
</P>
<P>
   Hall kicked a field goal and the Jets tried an onside kick, but
the Skins recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Davis tried to run out the clock, but on the third run, with
less than a minute remaining, the ball squirted loose as he was hit
by Bryan Cox. Cornerback Aaron Glenn picked it up, but was whistled
back. The play was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what can happen when you put yourself in that
position,'' said a beleaguered Jumbo Elliott later.
</P>
<P>
   Jets linebacker Roman Phifer, who left the Rams for the lure of
victory, said, ``I hate to say it, but I've been through this many
a year, and I thought it was behind me.''

`PRINCESS MONONOKE': WAGING A MYTHIC BATTLE TO PRESERVE A PRISTINE
FOREST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While watching ``Princess Mononoke,'' a landmark feat
of Japanese animation from the acknowledged master of the genre,
one can easily understand the film's phenomenal popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Outdone only by ``Titanic'' as Japan's box-office champ, this
intricate, epic fable is amazing to behold. No wonder the
filmmaker, Hayao Miyazaki, is acknowledged as an inspiration among
his American counterparts who have reinvented animated storytelling
in the post-``Little Mermaid'' era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a day goes by that I do not utilize the tools learned from
studying his films,'' John Lasseter (``Toy Story,'' ``A Bug's
Life'') has said. Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft, whose ``Mulan''
shows strong evidence of Miyazaki's influence, are on the record
with ``Miyazaki is like a god to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke,'' which was shown over the weekend as part
of the New York Film Festival (an unusual distinction for an
animated feature), explains what they mean.
</P>
<P>
   This exotically beautiful action film features gods and demons
locked in a struggle for the future of the unspoiled forest and an
elaborate moral universe that Miyazaki has created. As such, it is
a sweeping, ambitious version of the comic-book storytelling that
engendered it.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent battle scenes, graphic enough to make a sharp
distinction between ``Princess Mononoke'' and animation made for
children, keep the story in motion. These are often breathtakingly
rendered, but it is the film's stirring use of nature, myth and
history that make it so special.
</P>
<P>
   In a plot somewhat knotty for even the most ardent devotees of
anime (comics-derived Japanese animation), the events of ``Princess
Mononoke'' begin with an attack on a remote mountain village. A
demonic wild boar, drawn as a furious tangle of pulsating wormlike
strands and given the movements of a huge, terrifying spider, is
the reason the young hero Ashitaka goes off to save the forests.
</P>
<P>
   Those forests, imbued with a stirring, forthright sense of
natural beauty, turn out to be filled with Miyazaki's fanciful
inventions. The film is worth seeing just for the sight of its
Forest Spirit, which takes animal-like form by day and roams the
nights as a diaphanous Godzilla-like divinity with magical powers.
The image of plants and flowers springing to life beneath the
Forest Spirit's hooves as he walks is simple, meaningful and
ravishingly presented.
</P>
<P>
   The film features a superb blend of hand-drawn cels and fluid
computer-generated motion, but its look is also gratifyingly
understated. Notably absent are the little anthropomorphic touches
that enliven most animation involving animals; this film's
prevailing attitude toward its creatures is one of respect and
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   And in welcome contrast to the chest-thumping animated musical,
this film uses the grandeur of its score (by Joe Hisaishi)
gracefully to enhance the momentousness of its story. Individual
scenes are most intriguing for their rich variety in a film whose
human characters (ironworkers, lepers, hunters, former prostitutes
and Princess Mononoke, a feral young woman reared by wolves) are as
varied as the woodland fauna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke,'' which is being released by Miramax, has
been effectively translated (by Neil Gaiman) and dubbed into casual
Americanese without losing its Japanese essence. Billy Crudup,
Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton, Gillian Anderson, Minnie Driver
and Jada Pinkett-Smith all give vocal performances that suit the
vibrant images on screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke'' is rated PG-13 (parents strongly
cautioned). It has some gruesome battle images.
</P>

EAST CAROLINA FINDS THERE IS CALM IN THE EYE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a weekend for Ducks, for the Cardinal and especially for
Pirates who had survived a real hurricane to stun a bunch of the
football kind. There were comebacks and star turns by third-string
kickers and backup quarterbacks. It was a college football weekend
when the big hearts of the little guys triumphed.
</P>
<P>
   It was pretty great. Eight _ count them _ eight top-25 teams
were upended Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of them were beaten either by no-name teams or ones that
hardly figure to inspire ardor in sports-talk radio habitats.
</P>
<P>
   No victory was more dramatic than East Carolina's second-half
rally from a 20-point deficit that toppled the No. 9 Miami
Hurricanes, 27-23, as well as the goal posts of a borrowed field.
The Pirates were given zero chance against a reborn glamour team.
</P>
<P>
   They represented a basketball showcase, Conference U.S.A. They
practiced on high school fields in South Carolina the past week
because flooding and damage from Hurricane Floyd had displaced them
from their campus in Greenville, N.C. They even moved the game 85
miles west to North Carolina State's home field in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   When the Pirates fell behind by 23-3 in the third quarter to the
mighty Canes _ a team that had already upset Ohio State and had
come a play away from beating No. 2 Penn State _ no one would have
blamed them if they had packed it in.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, East Carolina  &UR; c &LR; oach Steve Logan watched his team turn
_ as he put it _ the tension of the past week into passion. The
Pirates (4-0) reeled off 24 straight points, capped by quarterback
David Garrard's 27-yard touchdown pass to Keith Stokes with a
little less than five minutes left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to get a win to go home with because I knew
it's going to be a lot of troubles when we get back there,'' said
Garrard, who was 20 of 27 passing for 222 yards in the second half.
``This will help build us a little bit, and the guys will be a
little more happier going back home.''
</P>
<P>
   You could hardly blame the East Carolina faithful who stormed
the field and ripped down both goal posts at Carter-Finley Stadium
in celebration after downing the highest-ranked team the Pirates
have beaten. In fact, don't be surprised if a Save the Goal Posts
fund emerges to repay the Pirates for providing a cathartic moment
for a battered region.
</P>
<P>
   Just as interesting on a weekend when the nation's top eight
teams impressively kept themselves in championship contention was
the way teams in the bottom half of the rankings exposed themselves
as overrated, inconsistent or plain careless.
</P>
<P>
   In the only game between top 25 teams, No. 4 Michigan handled
No. 20 Wisconsin, 21-16, and, in holding Ron Dayne without a yard
rushing in the second half, proved the Badgers to be a
one-dimensional, second-tier team.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama (3-1) beat No. 14 Arkansas, 35-28, and probably saved
 &UR; c &LR; oach Mike Dubose's job for another week. It was too late,
however, to save the job of Athletic Director Bob Bockrath, who was
fired last week in the wake of Louisiana Tech's victory over the
Crimson Tide. While East Carolina was winning on North Carolina
State's home field, the No. 25 Wolfpack was losing on the road to
its neighbor Wake Forest, 31-7.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of wannabe powers from the new Mountain West Conference
were upset as well, when Virginia dumped No. 17 Brigham Young,
45-40, and Wyoming beat No. 24 Air Force, 10-7.
</P>
<P>
   And not that any more evidence was necessary, but the West Coast
teams proved again that they are an entertaining mess and
nonfactors in the Bowl Championship Series. The 16th-ranked
Southern California Trojans and 18th-ranked UCLA Bruins were the
latest Pacific-10 heavies to be embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon Ducks (3-1) outlasted the Trojans, 33-30, after three
overtimes.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Frankel, Oregon's third kicker of the game, converted the
27-yard game-winner. This was after Nathan Villegas, the Ducks'
All-America kicker, tied the game on a 26-yard field goal with 30
seconds left in regulation. His ebullient teammates hoisted him in
the air but, as he was being let down, a still celebrating Duck
banged into his kicking knee. Now he may be out for several weeks
with ligament damage.
</P>
<P>
   In the first overtime, Oregon let its kickoff specialist, Dan
Katz, try a 33-yarder. He missed. But the Trojans' David Newbury
set the stage for Frankel by missing three potential game-winning
field goals _ one in regulation, one in the first extra period and
another in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just self-destructed at every turn,'' USC  &UR; c &LR; oach Paul
Hackett said of his 2-1 team. ``We lost every opportunity under the
sun.''
</P>
<P>
   The hottest team out West is one that gave up 69 points to Texas
in its opener, Stanford (3-1). The backup Joe Borchard came off the
bench to throw five touchdown passes _ including a Pac-10 record
98-yarder _ to beat the Bruins, 42-32. A right fielder for the
Cardinal's baseball team, he entered the game in the second quarter
after the starter Todd Husak was banged up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd go in and run the ball,'' said an unfazed
Borchard, who led Stanford to its first 3-0 conference start since
1971. ``I'm still a backup, my job is still just to be ready when
called upon, but I'm glad to get the opportunity to win.''
</P>
<P>
   So were the small programs in the netherworld of the college
football galaxy and their second- and third-teamers. The big
victories on strange fields and glorious cameos can be just as
uplifting as hyped showdowns between the powers. It's pretty great.

EX-BOYFRIEND KILLS BRIDE ON WEDDING DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A bride was shot dead in front of her family on Sunday by a
former boyfriend who walked uninvited into her New Jersey home as
the family was about to leave for the wedding, the authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The former boyfriend, dressed in wedding clothes, walked in at
about 4 p.m. as the woman was posing for a final round of
photographs, pulled a gun out of a briefcase and shot her,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   As a white Rolls-Royce and two stretch limousines for the
wedding party idled outside the home that the woman, Gladys Ricart,
39, shared with her 20-year-old son and her mother, the gunfire
sent a houseful of guests scrambling for cover, hiding in closets
and running down to the basement, said the Bergen County
prosecutor, William Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   The former boyfriend, Augustin Garcia, was arrested at the scene
_ a quiet street in the small Bergen County town of Ridgefield _
and was expected to be charged with murder, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor across the street who heard her dog bark came out to
see what the commotion was about and saw bridesmaids in light green
and champagne dresses running onto the lawn. ``They ran over to my
steps and sat down, and they were crying,'' said the woman, who
would not disclose her name. The flower girl for the wedding was
whisked into a neighbor's house to get her away from the violence,
the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ricart's fiance, James L. Preston, 36, of New York was to
meet her for the ceremony at the Church on the Hill in New York and
was not present when the shooting occurred, the authorities said. A
message left on Preston's answering machine Sunday night was not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ricart and Garcia, 47, of North Bergen, N.J., had dated for
about six years and had broken up several months ago, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt refused to say whether Garcia had been stalking Ms.
Ricart or whether she had an order of protection against him.
Rafael Heres, a relative of Ms. Ricart who was at the house, told
Channel 5 News that Garcia appeared deeply troubled. ``We already
knew the guy's background, and we figured that the phenomena would
occur,'' he said. ``He was a little negative. He couldn't accept
rejection.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ricart had met Preston about four months ago, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon, Schmidt said, Garcia apparently drove his
black sport utility vehicle to Ms. Ricart's home on Elizabeth
Street, a sycamore-shaded block of small tidy houses in a town of
10,000 people five miles west of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia parked and walked into 825 Elizabeth, a two-family,
brick-faced home where Ms. Ricart lived with her son, Davis Ricart,
and her mother, Anna Rosario, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the guests recognized Garcia when he entered, Schmidt
said. He would not say whether they asked Garcia to leave. When
Garcia found Ms. Ricart modeling her wedding dress for the
photographer, he shot her ``several times,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Afterward, investigators found a .38-caliber, five-shot handgun,
which they described as the murder weapon, in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said Preston worked for a Brooklyn business called
Double Click, but was unsure of the nature of the business.
Authorities had not determined Sunday night how Ms. Ricart and
Garcia were employed.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of grieving guests were taken from the house to a nearby
firehouse, where they were interviewed as witnesses _ and consoled
_ by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Ricart's body was carried out of the house around 8 p.m.,
the white Rolls-Royce still waited outside.

TEXAN SAYS HE HELPED BUSH JOIN THE GUARD IN VIETNAM WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to note in 8th graf that Barnes was a Democrat.)  (mk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A former speaker of the Texas Legislature said Sunday
that during the Vietnam War he personally contacted a general in
the Texas Air National Guard to help George W. Bush attain a
pilot's slot in a Guard unit upon his graduation from college.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Sunday afternoon, Ben Barnes, the
former speaker, confirmed that he had acted on Bush's behalf more
than 30 years ago after he was asked to do so by a wealthy Houston
oilman, Sidney Adger, who was also a friend of Bush's father,
George Bush, then a congressman from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether Bush, now the governor of Texas and the
early front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination,
received preferential treatment in joining the Guard has also
arisen in a lawsuit in which Barnes is scheduled to be deposed on
Monday in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to testify to the truth in my deposition,'' Barnes
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes refused to discuss any of the specifics of his meeting
with Adger, but he said the Houston businessman ``didn't tell me
that the Bush family was telling him to do it.'' Barnes said that
he had received numerous other such requests for help, and that no
one in the Bush family ever sought his help on the matter or
contacted him about it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has repeatedly denied that he joined the National Guard to
avoid the draft. Pressed on the question in recent days, he has
said that if anyone ever exerted influence on his behalf, he did
not know about it. Bush has said that neither he nor his father
ever intervened, a position that has been seconded by his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush did not need, and did not ask, anybody for help,''
said Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign. ``He applied,
met the qualifications, was accepted, served proudly and according
to military evaluations was an accomplished fighter pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, 61, has been a major figure in Texas politics since he
was elected to the State House at age 22. A Democrat, he served as
speaker and later as lieutenant governor, and President Johnson
once predicted that Barnes might make it to the White House. But he
became entangled in a state banking scandal, and though he was
never charged with a crime, his political career essentially ended.
</P>
<P>
   Now a businessman and lobbyist in Austin, Barnes is a major
figure in a federal lawsuit filed against Gtech, the company that
operates the Texas lottery. The suit, filed by Lawrence Littwin,
who was dismissed as director of the Texas lottery in 1997, centers
on alleged impropriety by Gtech. But lawyers for Littwin also want
to interview Barnes, a lobbyist for the company.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the lawyers have suggested in court papers that
Gtech was allowed to keep its state contract as a way of
maintaining Barnes' silence about Bush and the Guard.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the vaudeville actress and comedian Fanny Brice had her
nose bobbed in 1923, by a traveling quack in a hotel room, her
legions of fans wondered why in the world she would do that to
herself. The new skills in plastic surgery, learned in repairing
the faces of young soldiers disfigured in World War I, were just
coming into popular use.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, when the singer Carnie Wilson, daughter of Brian
Wilson of the Beach Boys, had a gastrointestinal bypass done as a
radical means of losing weight, the whole surgery was broadcast on
the Internet, on a Web site called adoctorinyourhouse.com, and
50,000 people viewed it.
</P>
<P>
   The very idea of broadcasting such a thing _ much less watching
it _ undoubtedly makes millions of Americans want to run out of the
room. A great part of the population still strives for spiritual
perfectability, and nurtures the idea of contentment with self. But
one of the great cultural, scientific and entrepreneurial themes in
America, as well as in Europe and other parts of the world, has
been the effort to remake and improve the physical being.
</P>
<P>
   American celebrity has often been a process of recreation, of
identities renamed, histories rewritten and personalities and
features recast, all of it in pursuit of a certain appearance.
Helena Rubinstein and Estee Lauder made fortunes selling the idea
of available good looks, and in a nation where more people of
different backgrounds look different from each other than in any
other place, the effort to assimilate, to blend in, has always been
a physical one.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to alter and repair has ancient roots. The first
attempts at nose reconstruction, Elizabeth Haiken writes in ``Venus
Envy: A History of Cosmetic Surgery,'' occurred in India in 600
B.C. The progress of medicine since then makes it possible for
almost the entire outward body to be nipped, tucked, tightened,
suctioned or recast today.
</P>
<P>
   The compulsion that used to go into ethnic erasure now rages in
pursuit of beauty, the appearance of youth, the correction of
whatever little thing annoys. Aging boomers get themselves new
faces, and parents in Southern California _ as in Brazil _ buy
their daughters larger breasts and flatter stomachs to go away to
college with.
</P>
<P>
   As Nancy Hass wrote in The New York Times' Styles section
recently, 10 million Americans, more than 6 per cent of the adult
population, have chosen to have some kind of plastic surgery in the
last decade, simply because they can. In a celebrity and
spectacle-obsessed age, more thousands now watch those procedures
being performed on the Internet. Plastic surgeons have become some
of the culture's newest cult figures.
</P>
<P>
   For the older generation, who survived World War II to realize
that their postwar babies all looked like Winston Churchill _ the
ultimate cut may come soon. Arabella Churchill, a baby who did in
fact grow up to look like her grandfather Winston, has accepted
free surgery to change her famous features. It is to be performed
live on celebritydoctor.com, the owner of the Web site, a former
model, has announced.
</P>
<P>
   Technology and all that aside, it seems more than a little sad
to cast off such distinguished lines in pursuit of common beauty.
There have, after all, been plenty of celebrated men and women who
got on without benefit of the surgeon's knife. Churchill's
features, viewed in a certain light, weren't exactly handsome on
him, either.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the example of Gertrude Stein, whose silhouette
grew as famous as her language and her taste. She seemed content to
loom large in all respects. A nose, she might have said, is a nose
is a nose.

   WASHINGTON _ The almost-new, shiny-white Jeep Cherokee looked
awfully sweet when Warren Hill paid $23,024 for it at a Fresno,
Calif., auto dealership in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``It even smelled new,'' Hill said in an interview on Sept.
24th. ``I thought, `Why would somebody have traded this in?' ''
</P>
<P>
   When he tried to trade it in himself two years later, Hill, a
telecommunications engineer, found out why. He said records
revealed the car had been in a terrible collision before he bought
it, that its left side had to be welded back together and that ``it
was structurally unsound . . . it was worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hill's case is among those being cited by dozens of
``lemon'' purchasers and consumer groups wondering why Congress
can't seem to pass a tough bill to prevent such rebuilt wrecks from
being sold to unwitting customers. Much of the groups' frustration
has emerged in letters to Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John
McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's committee has jurisdiction over the issue, and many
organizations, including the U.S. Department of Transportation,
aren't satisfied with the legislation he has co-sponsored to
address the problem. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., is
the bill's prime sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's Republican and Democratic staff members have
been bickering over whether the bill is sufficient. Meanwhile,
Public Campaign, a citizens' advocacy group, has accused Lott and
other co-sponsors of being influenced by auto-dealer lobbyists to
make sure the bill is a weak one, a charge that McCain denies.
</P>
<P>
   McCain believes the bill, while not perfect, ``represents a good
step forward in protecting consumers,'' said his spokeswoman, Nancy
Ives.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tug-of-war over the legislation has gotten personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As someone who was married for 20 years to a naval officer who
served over 22 years, I implore you to reconsider your
co-sponsorship,'' began a Sept. 7 letter to McCain from Rosemary
Shahan, a California consumer advocate. ``I know from experience
how auto dealers target enlisted service personnel for the sales of
wrecked vehicles, and (this bill) would make their predatory
practices even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a presidential candidate, is a formal naval aviator
whose father and grandfather were both admirals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are lured into buying what seems like a bargain, when
the real price of making it safe to operate is hidden, and beyond
what they can afford,'' Shahan wrote. ``Please think of the
families, who are already stressed from long tours and being
separated from their families and friends, being subjected to all
that goes along with being sold one of those junkers.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Shahan don't differ on the problem, just the
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that unscrupulous sellers are sometimes able to
hide a car's accident history by transferring its title from state
to state. Because states have varying standards and designations
for listing a car as ``salvage,'' the sellers shop around until
they get a title that grossly underestimates the damage. Sometimes,
the titles are tampered with to eliminate phrases such as
``Previous Damage'' that would tip off buyers that the cars had to
be restored.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona law requires a special ``rest/salvg'' notation on the
title of rebuilt salvage vehicles, so consumers are made aware of
the car's history. Still, some Phoenix residents have tried to
tamper with the titles of restored wrecks, according to police. And
there is evidence that salvage vehicles bought in Arizona have been
transported to other states that don't require such a specific
notation, according to the California-based Consumers for Auto
Reliability and Safety. That practice is called ``title washing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lott-McCain bill would provide states incentives, in the
form of motor-vehicle grants, for ensuring that titles of totaled
cars are labeled ``salvage,'' and that the cars themselves are also
marked. It would also set uniform standards on what defines a
salvage car.
</P>
<P>
   States would be encouraged, but not required, to comply. Such a
voluntary approach ``gets around the very real concerns that states
and the Supreme Court have raised about Congress requiring states
to legislatively adopt federal regulations,'' Lott said on the
Senate floor in May.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, who plan a press conference in Washington, D.C., on
Wednesday to list their concerns, contend that the measure isn't
forceful enough. They also object to a provision exempting cars
that are more than 6 years old from having to be labeled as
salvage.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the cars bought by less-well-off Americans, people
who are already more vulnerable to used-car scam artists,'' said a
column written last year by Public Campaign, which studies campaign
contributions to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great example of the problem of money in politics,''
Eric Schmeltzer, a Public Campaign spokesman, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The group says domestic auto dealers and their political action
committees contributed more than $7 million to congressional
candidates and political parties from January 1995 to June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Schmeltzer said the bill victimized ``those who can't afford to
give in the same numbers as auto dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bill's backers said the 6-year-old exemption is needed
because too many used cars would otherwise qualify as salvage even
if they weren't totaled. Under the bill, cars with damages
amounting to at least 75 percent of their worth would qualify for a
salvage label.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it (the car) is a $1,000 value, it would be minor damage''
that would push it over the threshold and cause it to be marked as
salvage, said Larry Greenberg, a vice president of the American
Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, which supports the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was cleared by McCain's committee in June. It could
still be amended to address some of the criticism if it is voted on
by the full Senate this year. &QL;

SEAHAWKS TAKE BIG STEP FORWARD WITHOUT GALLOWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ For three surreal minutes at the start of the game
Sunday, Jon Kitna was standing on the sideline. The Seahawks
quarterback kept looking out at the field, where everyone except
the Seahawks offense was scoring touchdowns for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna could not believe what he was seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny,'' Kitna said after the Hawks' 29-10 whupping of
the Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Center) Kevin Glover finally came over to me and said, `Are
we ever going to get to play?' '' Kitna said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's great. I mean, to walk out onto the field and have
a lead like that before you ever take one snap, that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, it was hard to believe that everything good Sunday was
happening to the Hawks. Usually, it seems, it's the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure is a little different,'' Kitna said. ``I mean, when
you're down 26-0, you're pretty much feeling out of it. But when
you're up 26-0, it's funny how you look at the other guys and think
they're just a couple of breaks away from coming back. Things
happen fast in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to an opportunistic start, fueled by Merton Hanks'
interception return for a touchdown and Charlie Rogers' 94-yard TD
punt return, the Hawks were up 14-0 with only 3:20 gone and before
their offense had even stepped onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach said jobs were on the line this week, and that is
definitely something we all understood,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Could these have been the same hard-luck Hawks who came into
this Steel City stadium exactly one year ago and lost a 13-10
dogfight in which the old Hawks were clearly shown how stagnant,
static and ineffective they were?
</P>
<P>
   Were these the same guys whose NFL hopes and expectations always
fell flat or short or were riddled full of folly?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't this a franchise for which over the last decade everything
that could go wrong usually did, and no one could ever quite
explain it?
</P>
<P>
   And isn't this the team that lost ugly to the Lions in its home
opener and last week required a second-half comeback against the
Bears to avoid an 0-2 blemish on the face of the Mike Holmgren era?
</P>
<P>
   Well, that face is a little sweeter and it's smiling now. It is
a face flush with promise.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, in what has been the intimidation palace of Three Rivers
Stadium, it was the Hawks who turned the tables not only on the
proud Steelers but also on themselves by rupturing a long-standing
aura of underachievement.
</P>
<P>
   The defense and special teams came out smoking, crushing the
life out of the Steelers and erasing the entire Pittsburgh game
plan. Meanwhile, the new Hawks offense also started to click _
surprising and encouraging since that offense is without its
game-breaking speedster whose contract holdout continues to fester.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Galloway may be missing in action with no end in sight, but
the longer this ridiculous standoff goes on, the more he has to
lose _ not the Hawks, who seem to be making good progress in their
new system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fun. This is exciting. This is the creativity that a
Mike Holmgren can bring to this team,'' said receiver Mike
Pritchard, who had a team-high six catches for 90 yards _ including
an eye-opening, 51-yard strike from Kitna on the Seahawks' first
offensive play of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, what a difference from last year. We're moving the
ball around so much more. This offense calls on everyone, whereas
last year we were so predictable in what we were doing,'' Pritchard
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Pritchard said Kitna was the most confident and poised
he has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   And the Holmgren offense is so diverse, Pritchard said, that
Galloway should be concerned about missing out on an opportunity to
learn and grow with a team, since the Hawks seem ready to take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine him in this offense,'' Pritchard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're moving around. You're keeping the defense on its heels.
In all fairness to Joey, last year he would get double-teamed
because we were so predictable. But in this offense, you couldn't
double-team a guy like that. There is so much possibility that can
happen, and for me, to tell you the truth, I'm taking advantage of
the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Hawks never did score an offensive touchdown, instead
sending in Todd Peterson to attempt six field goals, Pritchard said
the offense was executing much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting to the line quicker. We're eliminating the
motion penalties. We're starting to move the ball up and down the
field better. Now, the next step is to get it in the end zone,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While Galloway sits home in Columbus, Ohio, waiting for some
lightning bolt to open the Seahawks bank vault for him, the rest of
the team isn't missing the beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand to a point,'' Pritchard said of Galloway's
holdout, ``but not when it comes to one guy being bigger than the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks are moving forward, getting a taste of what kind of
banquet they could be feasting on if Holmgren gets his way with
this Seahawks team that appears ready to break through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next week is huge,'' Kitna said about the showdown with the
Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our first AFC West game, and we've got to get a leg up
on that. If we can go 7-0 the rest of the way at home, we'll get a
leg up on everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in as far back as any good Seahawks fan can
remember, there's good reason for optimism. The Hawks are starting
to really move.

QUAYLE, OUTSPENT BY BUSH, WILL QUIT RACE, AIDE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Vice President Dan Quayle has decided to
drop out of the race for president, a senior official with his
campaign said on Sunday night, because he is convinced that he
would not be able to raise enough money to keep pace with Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that Quayle had struggled to remain optimistic
about his chances of winning the Republican Party nomination but
that a review of his campaign's finances in recent days had forced
him to conclude that the odds against him were insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Vice President Quayle was extremely bullish on the
campaign's progress nationally and in New Hampshire, it became
clear that he did not have the resources to compete effectively in
the 18 or so contests that occur in the 30 days following New
Hampshire,'' said the official, who would speak only on the
condition of not being named.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire holds the nation's first presidential primary
contest early next year, and Quayle had invested significant time,
money and hope there.
</P>
<P>
   But, the official said, Quayle came to realize that ``even a
strong showing or win there would not provide the momentum needed
to achieve ultimate victory. And he's always said that the moment
he concluded that the campaign could no longer secure victory, he
would not ask supporters to continue expending their time and
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is the fourth candidate to drop out of the race for the
Republican nomination. Preceding him were Rep. John Kasich of Ohio,
former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Sen. Bob Smith of New
Hampshire, who announced that he was leaving the Republican Party
and would press forward with the quest for the presidency on his
own.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's exit narrows the field of Republican contenders to
eight, including the conservative television commentator Pat
Buchanan. But there is widespread belief that Buchanan might decide
to seek the nomination of the Reform Party instead.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Quayle announced his candidacy in Huntington,
Ind., on April 14, it failed to catch fire. Like most other
candidates, he was eclipsed by Bush, who has become, far and away,
the front-runner for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, it was the Texas governor's father, President George
Bush, who first put Quayle on the national stage by picking him for
the vice presidency, which Quayle held from 1989 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But during those years, Quayle arguably became most famous for
his awkward, embarrassing verbal gaffes, and his campaign seemed in
part to be an uphill struggle to persuade voters to take him
seriously. Quayle appealed to voters by advocating a 30 percent
across-the-board tax cut and a return to traditional values.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's fate seemed to be sealed, however, when Quayle
finished eighth among the nine candidates who competed in Iowa's
nonbinding straw poll last month. Afterward, leading people working
for Quayle in several states defected to rivals' campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle pressed on, insisting he was not discouraged. In an
interview a week and a half after the straw poll, while he was
campaigning in New Hampshire, Quayle said, ``Believe me, if I
didn't think I had a good chance of winning _ why spend 18 hours a
day, six, seven days a week doing this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other things in life,`' Quayle added. ``The moment
I'm convinced that I can't win, then I won't be here.`'
</P>
<P>
   The campaign official said the moment came over the weekend and
was a matter of dollars and sense. The official would not give
details of Quayle's fund-raising since June 30, when he reported a
total of $3.5 million in campaign contributions for the first two
quarters of the year. Bush, by contrast, reported about $37 million
for that period, and has since gone over $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser to the Quayle campaign, also speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Quayle could no longer ignore that
disparity. ``At some point,'' the adviser said on Sunday night,
``your head takes over your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also consistently led his Republican rivals in national
opinion polls by large double-digit margins. Although one recent
national poll showed Quayle a very distant second, most others have
put Elizabeth Dole, the former president of the Red Cross, in that
position, and some have shown Quayle also trailing Sen. John McCain
of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle had gained little enough traction that it is unclear
whether his departure from the race will have much of an impact on
any of the other contenders in the field. Quayle was concentrating
especially on the conservative end of the Republican spectrum, a
group of voters also being wooed by the wealthy publisher Steve
Forbes, the radio talk show host Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's advisers would not say whether Quayle planned to
endorse one of his rivals.

QUAYLE QUITS RACE `NO COMPLAINTS, NO BITTERNESS, JUST
DISAPPOINTMENT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES AND CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Former Vice President Dan Quayle ended his long-shot
bid for the White House on Sept. 26th, a victim of his inability to
raise enough money to compete against the juggernaut of the
front-runner, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle arrived at the decision after determining that even a
good finish in New Hampshire's early GOP primary election followed
by moderate success in fund-raising would not be enough to beat out
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle will formally announce his exit from the 2000
presidential election at a late-morning news conference today at
the Arizona Biltmore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just decided, `I'm not going to hang around and wring my
hands and continue to ask people to go out and raise money from me
when I don't see my way through to winning,' '' said Kyle
McSlarrow, Quayle's campaign chairman. ``He has always accepted
that it was a long shot, but he realized that, looking at it
rationally, that even if we did well in New Hampshire it just
wasn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision came just as Quayle appeared to be making some
headway. A nationwide CNN/Time poll released Sept. 24th showed
Quayle running a distant second to Bush (53 percent to 9 percent).
But it appeared to be too little headway coming too late in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a small meeting Sept. 25th at Quayle's home in Scottsdale
that included only Quayle, his wife, Marilyn, and McSlarrow, the
candidate decided to pull the plug, a move that surprised even some
on his own staff.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, after attending church with his wife, the former
vice president announced his decision to staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The realities undermined the campaign, and the realities of
this case are money,'' McSlarrow said, but added that Quayle is not
bitter about having to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't in the cards,'' McSlarrow said. ``There are no
complaints, no bitterness. Just disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   One campaign aide blamed Quayle's inability to gain traction
against the front-runners on his own unwillingness to engage in
negative campaigning and his hesitancy when it came to
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most decent guy in the race, and he was unwilling
to do some the things that all of his advisers told him,'' said
Fred Davis, Quayle's media adviser. ``He wouldn't go to the slimy
depths that it takes to raise money and wouldn't attack his
opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle becomes the fourth candidate to leave the race. Rep. John
Kasich of Ohio, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and Sen. Bob
Smith of New Hampshire exited the GOP primary earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   One beneficiary of Quayle's departure may be Arizona Sen. John
McCain, who may now become the race's undisputed authority on
foreign policy matters, according to one Quayle aide.
</P>
<P>
   `McCain can immediately claim the foreign policy mantle now,''
said Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, Quayle's pollster.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest factors in Quayle's decision, according to
Davis, was his distaste for repeatedly going to friends for money
and support in a race that increasingly looks locked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, it began to look like an imposition,'' Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Quayle will likely wait some time before deciding
whom to endorse for president. For now, they said Quayle will look
to become more involved in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a tough venture and an emotional venture, and I
think he wants to move on to something else,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's campaign efforts had looked increasingly gloomy after
the August Iowa Straw Poll, where he finished in eighth place,
behind conservative talk-show host Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   The showing was considered devastating for the former vice
president, and he took it seriously, telling his staff they would
have to rethink almost every aspect of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Quayle was struggling to keep his campaign
liquid, having to borrow from banks against federal matching funds,
which were due to arrive in January. As of this month, the campaign
had raised $4 million. Bush's war chest has reportedly ballooned to
more than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's exit left many wondering what it will mean to the GOP
field. A number of Quayle's supporters said the decision will
benefit Bush, who now has one less competitor to worry about in his
so-far unimpeded march to the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it clearly strengthens George Bush,'' said Indiana
Sen. Dan Coats, national co-chairman of Quayle's campaign. ``One by
one, he is eliminating some of his stronger opponents, and I think,
clearly, this is going to be perceived as another feather in his
cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Coats said he had hoped to see Quayle remain in the race longer,
among other reasons, to allow the candidate to rehabilitate himself
in the eyes of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel bad that Dan did not have an opportunity to
re-present himself to the American people so that they could see
who he really was,'' Coats said. ``He outlined a very solid agenda
for the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Quayle's move may have caught his supporters off guard,
many political observers said they had expected it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only surprise was that he didn't recognize immediately
after the Iowa Straw Poll that it was over, and it really never
started,'' said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the
University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, who watched his career nearly consumed in 1988 by media
reports about his high-profile gaffes and privileged background,
ran a traditional Republican campaign. His campaign issued routine
press releases on issues such as U.S. foreign policy on China, and
Quayle himself spent considerable time giving speeches on
conservative themes.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidate was nonetheless unable to make a dent in
Bush's large lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, deep down, Quayle thought he could be the next
Richard Nixon _ that he could confound the critics and achieve a
comeback,'' Sabato said. ``His image was so damaged within his own
party that he was just never a credible candidate.'' &QL;
